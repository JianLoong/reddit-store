Yet my wife doesn\u2019t care and keeps doing it because she says it\u2019s her house too. The final straw happened when our child was sick in bed and she brought a friend in her room unannounced which only added to the frustration.

Your daughter is on the cusp of puberty and trust me when I say this disrespect for privacy can turn into a disrespect of any kind of privacy or autonomy. Regardless, her behaviour is going to have a serious and lasting effect on your daughter.\n\nMy mother was like this, she never knocked, I was never allowed to lock the bathroom door, insisted it was her house and she could go where she wanted. It escalated to her going through my stuff (including my bin) regularly, reading my post, listening in on my phone calls, phone the therapists to demand what I'd said because it was her \"right as my mother\". Luckily, the internet was only just becoming a thing! :S At 16 I decided, legally, to get the doctor to prescribe me meds (for endometriosis) she had previously forbidden, she threatened to sue the doctors. I also then got my nose pierced and she went on a rant about how I'm not allowed to do these because \"she made me\".\n\n\nWhat your wife is doing can breed feelings of depression, resentment, shame, distrust, loneliness and irreparably damage their relationship.\n\nEdit bad spelling. At least the ones I can see.", "She\u2019s really taking this next level, rudely and deliberately in a selfish way. NTA", "NTA but there is something wrong with your wife' s parenting. Marriage therapy. If you wife doesn' t get a grip she may find herself being ghosted by your daughter one day.", "NTA - it's also YOUR house, so feel free to exercise that power yourself by instilling an absolutely no entering before a knock and response rule.", "NTA. Please update us if you find a way to break your wife of this toxic \"must show the home off like a guy holding a fish on tinder\" habit. My family does this to me... in *my* house. I'm in my 40's. Stand up for your kid now or, I assure you, she will be LC/NC as soon as she is old enough", "Your wife's reasoning is the EXACT  reason why my biological mother ended up barging into my bedroom only to find my boyfriend changing while I was showering. Both my boyfriend and I were in high school at the time so we were both under the age of 18.\n\nMy biological mother still wonders to this day why my boyfriend and I yelled at her and why I was pissed and swearing at her.", "NTA. You don't parade strangers into your child's room without permission that's so rude!! Like your child is sick and you're going to just barge in??", "That happened to me once when I was having a wank, just maintained eye contact till my aunt closed the door \ud83d\ude02 NTA", "NTA. You were right, your daughter was right. It is not only incredibly disrespectful but also even a bit dehumanizing to have your privacy and personal health disregarded for things that are so frivolous.\n\nThe time to give your daughter a lock on her door may be soon. If your wife isn't going to make the right choice on her own, it seems like everyone else is capable of doing it for her. And also, attend counseling with her. If she's constantly fighting with your daughter, it may be that SAHP is not the job for her and your kid would get better care at daycare/after school programs", "NTA my mom once let my friend into my room while I was sleeping. I woke up to said friend staring at me in the dark. It startled me, such a bizarre experience. Even though it was someone I knew it was a boundary I felt was crossed. If she saw I was sleeping she should've turned her away or at least woke me up and asked me if it's okay.", "NTA for sure. Damn good parenting, and please get that kid a lock on her door that only you and her have access to. \nYour wife has apparently shown constant disregard for your daughters feelings and personal space, and you need to make sure your daughter knows that's not okay.", "YTA. People give tours of their homes. That\u2019s not weird. I cannot imagine having been 8 and spoken to a parent like that. Wow.", "NTA. Just be sure, when you get divorced, get a good lawyer and try your best to get full custody.", "NTA, I\u2019m in college and I would feel beyond violated if I was at home sick in bed and my mom woke me up by bringing her friend I barely know into her room and turned on all the lights. And that situation isn\u2019t nearly as bad as your daughters because I\u2019m an adult. I can fight back or move out. Your kid has no other option. Please please please stand up for your kid on this one. If you don\u2019t, no one else will", "NTA also, put a lock on your kid\u2019s door. She is reaching a sensitive age where she will need privacy.", "Nta. It\u2019s a double standard but I\u2019m ok with it. Girls need their space no matter what. I stopped just walking in my daughters room years ago. It\u2019s definitely a respect thing. Also the wife\u2019s need to show everyone everything? Fuck that. Here\u2019s the kitchen,livingroom,and bathroom. Go here to get a beer. Go here to enjoy it. Go here to get rid of it then fuck off back out the door you came in", "NTA. She can be respectful and say this is our daughters room, she\u2019s sick though so we will move on.", "All sides including the 8 year old are ESAH- an 8 year old NOT be yelling at an adult- specifically a parent. \nYour wife should at the very least- knock on the door before she enters since children are entitled to some level of privacy and expectation of forewarning before the door opens. \nYou however need to support both- your daughters dignity/request for some level of privacy coupled with correcting her misbehavior by yelling at her Mother. \nNo one walks away unstinking in how you are handling this. Parents need to reach agreements in acceptable/unacceptable behavior and consequences and avoid the divide/conquer that appears to be occurring with your 8 year old. \nHow would you respond to your 8 year old yelling at YOU because she doesn\u2019t agree with something you are doing ? Would you tolerate that?", "There's kind of two different things here.   First, you say the give and get respect with an 8 year old.   Sorry, not a freaking chance in hell.  It's child and adult and if the child doesn't respect them, too freaking bad.\n\nNow, with that in mind, it's not unreasonable to ask for privacy in ones room, unless there's something just amazing in the room to show off.", ">you\u2019d be teaching her that boundaries don\u2019t matter and that she should let adults violate them\n\nMom is going to be flabbergasted 5-20 years from now when daughter falls in with an abuser. \"I didn't raise my daughter like this!\" Yes you did!", "I feel like doing this in front of/with a friend shows that it's already gotten out of hand. I can't imagine barging into anyone's room period, let alone with a guest in tow. It makes me so, so sad for her daughter that she doesn't have a safe place or a sanctuary because who knows when mom will just run in on her.", "I agree with this. He doesn\u2019t speak highly of his wife or to her. They need to be able to discuss parenting differences respectfully. Of course she shouldn\u2019t have barged into the room, but she also shouldn\u2019t be berated by her husband as though she is a child. He is doing to his own wife the very thing he is upset that she is doing to their child.", "I guarantee that any child that is disrespected by their parents don\u2019t respect them. They might fake it, but they don\u2019t", "Is bad mother.\n\nYOU THINK IM A BAD MOTHER???!?!!", "Well said!", "Yeah anyone agreeing that the mom is a victim in anyway is a dumb ass and should not be having kids. You need to divorce your wife. I see cps in the future if you let her keep up this behavior with your child.", "LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE TIME I TRY TO HAVE A RATIONAL CONVERSATION WITH HER", "On one hand, it's great that a kid that age is empowered to speak up against her mother's behaviour. On the other hand, it's sad that she has to!", "Poor bot must be day drinking.", "y'all have another long lost sibling\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nme, a trans gay idiot that's obsessed with microwaves and the word Ebola", "Welcome to the family!", "yey"]}
