If they can\u2019t keep spare tyre in their own car, it\u2019s their fault. You need yours. There is a limit to being nice. You don\u2019t want to be stranded somewhere without a spare tyre because some idiots refuse to \u201cdeal with that stuff\u201d.", "NT. Did they even offer to pay for the tire?", "NTA. If it was a newish  BMW it probably didn\u2019t have a spare anyway. It either has run-flat tyres or a can of temporary sealing foam in the trunk.", "NTA.  Call the police non-emergency line and tell them there is a disabled vehicle in front of your home and that the passengers are causing a major disturbance.\n\nEdit: Cops will come and have it towed if they can't get it moving.", "NTA - Why do I have a feeling that these women were extremely attractive? Anyway, I don't care about the potential entitlement or the learned helplessness. I feel that you are correct that you have no idea if and when you get that spare tire back and it comes with a cost to replace if you end up having to do that. The spare tire has economic value and should not be expected that it is given away for free.\n\nAdditionally, even if you get that spare tire back, you have no idea how a complete group of strangers treated it. Spares are only intended to be used for something like 50 - 75 miles; their purpose is to have something to get you to the tire shop so it is kind of worthless if you get it back.", "Nta.\n\n But not having a spare is not their fault either.\n\n Over the last few years car manufacturers have eliminated spares tires to make the cars lighter, so the car gets better gas mileage. And giving you just. Can of fix a flat.   Which doesn't help on a sidewall blow out.\n\n Most of the manufacturers give you a 10 year/100,000k roadside assistance.\n\nAt least when I was shopping back in 2018 that is what I saw at the many dealerships I went to.\n\n Not all lug patterns are the same and some cars have more then 4 studs.  \n\n They need to call a tow truck and be done with it\nOr call their daddies.", "Do people not have AAA? NTA", "\"We don't deal with that stuff\" lol, welcome to the real world \"luv\" \n\nNTA", "NTA. This is what roadside assistance is for. What partners and families and friends are for. \n\nIt's *insane*, though very kind, that your partner even offered his spare. But if they'd gone through with it then *you* wouldn't have a spare the next time you had a flat.\n\nThere is a harsh truth: just because you can afford to buy (or finance) a car, doesn't mean you can afford a car. Running a car is more than fuel. It's insurance and maintenance and repairs and registration fees. If they don't have a spare then it's on them to make arrangements.", "You:  NTA\n\nBF:  Ignorant, at least.  What happens if they drive their car with the wrong size tire that he put on and they get into an accident or the car gets damaged?", "NTA. People who own cars and don't care about knowing the most basic things like how to install a spare or use a puncture kit should either pay for a roadside rescue service like AA, or a tow truck.", "NTA\n\nTires are expensive.", "They can just call a tow truck, or road side assistance through their insurance.

Grrr.", "Probably not literally AAA bc I think this is in the UK but yeah, they weren't stranded somewhere unsafe... They can definitely call for roadside assistance or a tow.", "A lot of BMWs in Volvos have the different sizes on the front and back.\n\nJust to change your own oil can be an adventure.
