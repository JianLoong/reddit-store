A Speech and Language Pathologist (SLP) can further assess your son and give their professional recommendation. There is a difference between shy and not developing proper communication.

She uses games when she does her therapy. A kid can\u2019t move their game piece or crank a bingo machine until they repeat a word/phrase/a little tongue twister. Once they get it right the game moves right along. Speech for little ones isn\u2019t scary or made to be difficult.
