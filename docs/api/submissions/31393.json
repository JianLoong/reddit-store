A Speech and Language Pathologist (SLP) can further assess your son and give their professional recommendation. There is a difference between shy and not developing proper communication.

She uses games when she does her therapy. A kid can\u2019t move their game piece or crank a bingo machine until they repeat a word/phrase/a little tongue twister. Once they get it right the game moves right along. Speech for little ones isn\u2019t scary or made to be difficult.

Gives your child an outlet to more clearly state wants and needs and potentially sooths some of your concern about him not verbalizing that much. \n\nIf you go that route, please use official signs for your area rather than pidgin signs you make up / modify from official (it'll save trouble down the road if this becomes a primary language you child uses for a time that others outside your family need to understand.

That they'll tell you he's fine? That he'll get support to help his development? That you'll learn some tool to better care for him? \n\nIf anything, your wife betrayed your trust by dismissing your concerns so completely. She's being selfish and insecure by equating you wanting to have him evaluated by a specialist with thinking there's something wrong with being quiet. \n\nThis warrants a sit down talk where she explains why she's so against tlearning whether he has a speech delay or not. Does she have her hand in the sand? Does she feel defensive of her own quietness? Does she like having a house that you wouldn't know a toddler lives in? But none of those are good reasons to neglect looking into potential health and developmental issues. \n\nPlease don't let her pull him out of preschool. Three year olds need socialization. If he's not hearing people talk to him all day at home, it's quite probable that's why he isn't talking. He's just used to not talking, which isn't inherently bad- but it means he's not getting practice in. It means when he starts kindergarten, his speech might still sound like a toddler.

It\u2019s an evaluation, not brain surgery. There are only best case scenarios here- 1 He gets the eval and they say he is fine. 2 He gets the Eval and they do determine his speech is developmentally behind BUT determining that at an early age gives him the best fighting chance to catch up before this makes a larger and potentially negative impact on his life. \n\nMaybe she thinks he is like her and doesn\u2019t want to talk, maybe she is scared of your child needing speech therapy or she is scared that he could be diagnosed with something. Whatever those thoughts or feelings are is irrelevant. Her opinion doesn\u2019t matter and won\u2019t change the fact that her son may be speech delayed and the he couple possibly benefit from speech therapy. For your son to have the best outcome only a professional\u2019s opinion matters here- and on the basis of everyday educational interaction you have already had one professional advise you to seek a second opinion so that you son can get support if needed. If you fail to get your son that evaluation you are failing him as a parent. It\u2019s your job to advocate that he gets help and support if he needs it. It\u2019s a shame your wife is putting her emotions in front of opening up every avenue possible to help your son succeed. \n\nBecause again, maybe the speech professionals don\u2019t see a problem and that would be fantastic. But if he does have a delay and you do not follow through with an eval and speech therapy then you are missing a prime developmental age to allow speech therapy to improve his chances as he gets older. \n\nYou have a chance now to prevent your child from potentially being that kid who gets made fun of for his speech. No doubt that behavior is terrible and not excusable (kids are cruel), but knowing that behavior is wrong  doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t potentially face challenges one he is school aged if there is a speech delay/issue and he stutters or has a lisp or something else. You have the opportunity now to give him resources so that he doesn\u2019t have to experience that. Don\u2019t let your child down on this one. honestly, this extends beyond school even into professional environments as an adult, do the right thing and get him evaluated. This would be a hill to die on for me and if your wife really can\u2019t get past her emotions on this than I\u2019d be wary about any other types of medical/emotional health neglect in the future- her feelings that he is fine in her eyes does not come above a professionals opinion that you need to seek further care with more professionals.", "Info What's up with all these posts about \"in going to take my kid to the dentist/doctor/speech therapist behind my wife's back\" lately?

As therapists we need to be better about \u201creading\u201d the kids to know how far can we \u201cpush\u201d before the kid need a break.", "That doesn't sound like good OT! That just sounds like ABA.\n\nIs he hitting as a form of communication or for sensory seeking or because he is angry?", "She\u2019s taking him away from an environment where he is being exposed to communication and language. She doesn\u2019t talk much and the house is quiet so how does the wife think the son will learn how to communicate???", "I didn\u2019t even realize this till you mentioned it. I was homeschooled but we had \u201cread aloud\u201d books that my mom would read. We\u2019d do chapters and then talk about what the chapter covered as a little summary each time. \n\nI bet this could be a great start with things like Cat in the Hat books.", "My 15yo is a total bookworm and has always loved story time. She is never without a book in her hand (and if she is, it's more often than not why she is on her phone - kindle and the library apps are great!)\n\nMy 13yo though, even as a toddler, it was hard to get him to settle and listen to stories or read books. He has ADHD as well as dyslexia, autism and a speech and language delay (and a few other things) which is why the above approach worked so much better for him. Even now, getting him to sit still and focus can be hard, and he is in a more flexible/alternate type of school for this reason, where they do more hands-on and interactive learning (still using literacy and numeracy skills).", "Third this, as someone who lived it. \n\nI was diagnosed with Autism at 12/13. Through the school because my mom refused to follow up, but my grandmother had guardianship for school. \n\nMy mother denied my diagnosis, and went so far as to try and say there was nothing wrong with my kids.  My eldest spoke fine, but has the absolute worst sensory overload issues. You would have absolutely believed that anything mushy was acid they were being asked to eat when they were 3-6. My son was non verbal, in the his hearing was fine, he could say Mama, Hi, Bye, and cup and that was it at 1.5.  And my son is very autistic. A walking, talking, annoying now at 13 years old outright trope of autism. People had been calling him Young Sheldon before it was an actual spin off because he was a genius level autistic kid who skipped grades, wore only comic book tshirts, is obsessed with Doctor Who and wants to be an astrophysicist\u2026and when called Young Sheldon would give people a flat stare and say \u201cMy name is A___, not Sheldon\u201d. And yeah, he knew what big bang theory was, he likes the song and knows Jim Parsons plays a character named Sheldon Cooper. He was just not making the connection that it was a comparison and not forgetting his name. \n\nMy son obviously needed interventions, and has received them. \n\n\nFor OP\u2019s situation it might be the wife fearing the diagnosis, OR it could be her mother. Who feels there was no such things in her day and refused treatment or diagnosis when OP\u2019s wife was a kid because SHE didn\u2019t want to put a diagnosis on something she did and then instilled shame in OPs wife for even considering seeking answers or questioning if neurodivergence was ever considered. \n\nIf not for my grandma that could have been me.\n\n\nUndiagnosed, Baby Boomer parents can absolutely be  neurodivergent AND Narcissists.", "I didn\u2019t talk beyond basic words and phrases until 4 and by that point had a wretched speech impediment. Even after speech therapy (in 4th grade! it took THAT long to help me) when I\u2019m tired or drinking my words don\u2019t come out right and it\u2019s not even the drunken slur it\u2019s a very obvious speech issue. \n\nI also got diagnosed with ADHD at 30 (also a woman). The 80s and 90s did us dirty, if I\u2019d been diagnosed sooner it would\u2019ve saved me a lot of heartache and anxiety.", "Same. I had a speech impediment growing up that was with my R\u2019s. I grew out of it, but was bullied relentlessly for it during school. You can still slightly hear it too, but it\u2019s not enough for anyone to care. OOP should absolutely have his son checked at the very least to make sure everything is okay. I wish my parents did it for me.", "I\u2019ve had anxiety all my life but wasn\u2019t diagnosed until I was 20 and dropped out of college after a mental breakdown. A part of me still mourns what my life would be like if I was put on meds earlier. I\u2019m still working on the anger of waiting 31 years for an OCD diagnosis. What would my life be like if I didn\u2019t have to suffer all these years? I know friend, it sucks.\n\nOPs wife is doing a disservice to her child. She should want the most resources and care posssible to access early intervention if her child needs more help talking.", "I\u2019ve had this conversation several times with my partner. I have ADHD and he does not. He CANNOT picture things and it took a long time to realize some of our little riffs were because he literally can\u2019t visualize things. For example, I think through a scenario and can picture what would happen and the results of different actions. He can\u2019t do that so just does the action and if it fails, whoops. My brain is not that forgiving of my own mistakes, so I am glad his is.", "I can listen to entire songs in my head without having music playing, or watch scenes from a movie. It's incredibly distracting. Even just typing this out now, I thought of how I could give an example and now my head is playing the scene from the Matrix where Neo gets flushed out of the pod, with all of the sound effects as well and now this has taken me twice as long as it should have done to type out, thank you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, now I've got RATM playing my head. It's a pain because you can't just turn it off, and headphones don't help, it's just like listening to two tracks overlapping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of thinking in pictures, I visualise what I recall or want to say, whether that's literally recalling the exact wording from a page or \"playing back\" a conversation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, time is a sort of running-track shape. We're currently (late October) on the short side before the curve to the long bottom straight. The day is a sort of hill shape. I can't describe it, it just is what it is.\n\nAlso, FYI, I am not diagnosed with anything but if they checked I probable would be.", "Is it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A91tvp0b1fY) you learned about aphantasia?\n\n\u2191It's Hank\u2191", "So I would suggest reading or listening to one of Temple Grandin's books if you want something more in depth. Her visual thinking is the closest I've ever got to another being like me ... Except she is a successful genius and I am not hahaha. \n\nIt's a bit hard for me to explain, the same way I guess when I've asked others, \"how do they think\", and they say \"I don't know I just do\". \n\nBut for me I see images in 2 D that are related to the words I want to speak but the difficulty is when those images are super rapid fire and I'm exhausted emotionally or physically or even over stimulated I can't put a word to that image quick enough and it can cause me to panic and my jaw to lock. Also if an image is produced that does not match the intended word I can get hyper fixated and embarrassed and panic/shutdown for that as well. \n\nLike I start talking about cows but we are in front of horses because to me they look so similar a cow is just a fat horse especially if it's black and white. \n\nI would say if you had to imagine what my brain looked like it would be one of those old fashion zoetrope (moving picture machines). But mix it with a steel wool ball because one image can spark another and it just gets tangled sometimes.\n\nSomeone in the comments mentioned sign language and I am actually planning to learn that since it's a visual language it might be a way I can communicate even when panicked.", "I can relate to this completely - both as having kids on the spectrum and being there myself (kids are formally diagnosed, I was informally diagnosed by my childrens team of therapists as an adult and haven't had the time or money to get it formalised). \n\nYou are right, a diagnosis doesn't change who someone is, but it does change the options and supports available. We don't think of it as labelling in our house, we think of it as knowing how and why our brains work differently. My kids are the most amazing, resilient people, and much like you, I love them for who they are. \n\nEven at 4 kids can recognise when they are different. My son frequently came home crying wanting to know why he wasn't like the other kids. Being able to explain that his brain (and everyone's brain) works differently and that nothing was wrong with him, helped immensely with his mood and temperament. \n\nEducating the adults around us before their diagnosis (during the various assessments, as they have multiple disabilities) was hugely beneficial in the kids accepting and understanding their diagnoses. \n\nGood luck with the process and moving forward afterwards. I am sure your family and child will have a successful future, however that looks for you all  :)", "Ok so i was diagnosed very early. I always knew i had Autism but i didn't always understand what it meant. School was difficult. I'd often get myself into fights with both teachers and students. A lot of the times it was because i had a hard time understanding social cues and there would be misunderstandings. Kids weren't always nice to me either although i wasn't relentlessly bullied necessarily. And i did have some friends btw. I feel for your son. I don't think he is a bad kid, i think he is a good kid but he just has a lot strong emotions and he has a real hard time controlling his anger. School can be a hellhole for autistic people. Autistic children are often bullied and excluded and frankly, i am sick of it! Like. I get that it's hard for NT people to put themselves in ND people's shoes and vice versa but that doesn't make it right to bully. I just hope things get better for your son. A lot of parents go in denial and don't wanna get their child tested but i think that with a diagnosis, it will be a lot easier for the child to recieve the accommodations that they need (Although i feel like i didn't recieve the right help still anyway) i don't think it will hurt. I know it can cost a lot (At least for adults who wanna get diagnosed) but i think it can be helpful", "Thank you! I can and will do more to support him.", "He probably does. He doesn\u2019t live in my state so I\u2019m not familiar with the specifics of his higher education opportunities but he lives within an hour or so of some larger cities so l\u2019d think the universities there would have something like that. Thanks for the info.", "Funny enough, that\u2019s the setting I work in", "It really is.Years ago when my nephew was about 3 a friend asked his mother when he would begin speech therapy. She assumed he would, as did anyone who heard him speak. His mother got very angry and no one, to my knowledge, had ever brought it up again. I don\u2019t know his dad\u2019s opinion but I\u2019m guessing he agrees with his wife. I really cannot comprehend refusing to get your child through help he needs to speak clearly and be understood.", "My bad. I realize I misread it. Long work days on computers made some very tired eyes. Also texted my uncle instead of my husband asking about dinner not long after I made my comment.", "Definitely!  My eldest and I are always talking about books. With my son it is movies and lego. Whatever works to get them talking :)", "I was much older than 30 when I found out I was tongue-tied! I saw an oral surgeon for something entirely unrelated. It bothered him so much that it had never been fixed that he did it for free then and there.\n\nIn fairness, my parents had no idea, so it was not negligence on their part. It wasn't severe, but I did have trouble saying a few words, and I just always figured that was just how I was.", "That always blows my mind because having a correct diagnosis or label is a huge part of dealing with said problem.  Give me a medicated and therapized bipolar any day over an undiagnosed crazy untreated incel.", "Dude that is why I have been hooked on reading since I was itty bitty. I literally LIVE in the book while I am reading it. Also why people suddenly talking to me while reading can scare the fuck out of me as I am suddenly forced back into the real world. I may have to look into that lol.", "\u2026is that not normal? Isn\u2019t that what happens when everyone reads a book? I\u2019ve had times where I\u2019m reading a book and when I want to go back to it later I think \u201cwhat was that show I was watching?\u201d And then realize oh wait, it was a book. I thought that happened to everyone when reading??", "Oh boy\u2026 TIL that\u2019s not how everyone reads books is it?", "I'm the same. I didn't Wana diagnose the kid, but there's definitely more going on. I also have autistic parents in denial (they've never acknowledged I got it from my mama, as the song goes). I get the feeling OP's wife might be having the same denial.", "You can't have me, I'm taken - but otherwise I agree fully ;)", "I thought it was everyone but it's not. Most people can see something, and then some can see extremely vividly (hyperphantasia) and some people have no visual imagination at all (aphantasia, it's the most rare)", "I have it that way and sometimes parts of books become like true memories for me, like the same as me coming down the stairs at 6 on Christmas.  It can have some drawbacks (I have a completely unreliable memory system at times). but I know I can be locked in the dark alone and I\u2019ll be fine because my brain will just give me the same life experiences as outside without the sensory input.", "Nope! They just \u201chear\u201d the list of words.\n\nI have the hyperfantasia\u2014 I \u201csee\u201d books like a movie screen play out. I\u2019ll also get cold, hot, hungry, etc if the characters feel like that.\n\nBut this is why I can\u2019t stand audiobooks. It\u2019s way harder for me to \u201csee\u201d the scene when I hear it instead of read it. \n\nAudiobooks are just someone talking *at* me for hours on end and it makes me insane. If other people experience reading the way I experience audiobooks, I\u2019m not surprised they don\u2019t like to read"]}
