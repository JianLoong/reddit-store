He passed the hearing test but that isn\u2019t enough and a pediatrician won\u2019t help identify other problems. A Speech and Language Pathologist (SLP) can further assess your son and give their professional recommendation. There is a difference between shy and not developing proper communication. An SLP is also able to asses your kiddo for his speech sounds (including phonological disorders like aphasia or dysarthria), language comprehension, literacy, social communication, voice (how loud or quiet a voice is if something is affecting it), fluency, and swallowing disorders.\n \nMy mom has been a SLP for almost 25 years and works in an elementary school and was part of an all ages private practice. She uses games when she does her therapy. A kid can\u2019t move their game piece or crank a bingo machine until they repeat a word/phrase/a little tongue twister. Once they get it right the game moves right along. Speech for little ones isn\u2019t scary or made to be difficult. Your son will only benefit from speech and not get to a point where he is bullied about it like some of the private students my mom tutors on the side that are in middle school. \n\n****NOTE: I AM NOT SUGGESTING HIS SON HAS AUTISM, DIAGNOSING HIM AS AUTISTIC, OR IMPLYING HIS BEHAVIOR MIGHT BE AN INDICATOR OF AUTISM THIS IS JUST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.****\nMy mom also specializes in autism and identifying signs of autism and sees autistic students for help with social skills. Once a month all the autistic kids go to her classroom before school starts and eat a breakfast while working on things like \u201chow to respond when you get a gift you don\u2019t like\u201d, practicing eye contact, talking about appropriate social responses to things people tell you, she even has gone over slang that other students use or she hears on TikTok to help students socialize with peers.

If there is an issue it is usally easily corrected at his age (my daughter was fine after a few sessions). If his speech is fine then there might be another issue going on like feeling anxious. There is a difference between being quiet because you want to be and being quiet because you feel too anxious or uncomfortable to speak (or some other reason).\n\nYour wife may feel this is an attack on her as she is quiet.

I am still quite socially awkward but definitely not silent (although since I am a visual thinker- I think in pictures and have to translate them into spoke words- so I have issues with going nonverbal). I was diagnosed as autistic in adulthood and I think it would have had some benefits if I had been properly assessed as a child. \n\nI think most should take the cautious approach to try to see if their child needs skill building or assistance and there is always the route of getting a second or third opinion if they are ever diagnosed with something.", "Yeah not getting it checked would lead to more problems if there is an issue", "I know you guys don't typically see the long term results of what you do.
