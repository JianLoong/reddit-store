My sister saw her dad every other weekend but she also needed to be in therapy for years because the court agreed there was a risk that he would try to poison our relationship. He also needed to stay far away from me. The last time I saw him I was 14 and he showed up to pick up my sister when he wasn't supposed to and I was home alone for a couple of hours.

Here's the reasoning:\r  \n\r  \nYou Suffered Significant Trauma: You were subjected to years of emotional abuse and cruelty from your sister's dad, which had a profound and lasting impact on your mental and emotional well-being. This trauma is not something you can simply \"let go\" of, as your sister seems to suggest. Trauma is real and often requires ongoing therapy and support to heal.\r  \n\r  \nYou've Undergone Therapy: You have sought therapy from a young age to address the issues caused by this trauma. This demonstrates that you've been actively working on improving your mental health and well-being.\r  \n\r  \nYour Sister's Dad's Actions Were Inexcusable: Your sister's dad's treatment of you was inexcusable and harmful. He created a hostile and abusive environment, which affected you deeply. His past actions and attitudes make it entirely reasonable for you to want to avoid being around him.\r  \n\r  \nYour Sister's Request Is Unreasonable: Your sister's request for you to be around her dad, even if she believes she can keep you separated or get him to apologize, is unreasonable given the traumatic history you have with him. It's not about \"hating\" him; it's about protecting yourself from further emotional harm.\r  \n\r  \nYour Mother Supports Your Decision: Your mother, who likely knows the full extent of the trauma you endured, supports your decision not to attend the wedding, even if she wishes things could be different. Her stance adds weight to the validity of your choice.", "NTA\n\"She asked me to love her more than I hated her Dad\"\nIf it's so why can't she love you and care for your mental health\nYou are not asking her to uninvite her dad, you are just not attending because you refuse to be in the vicinity of your torturer\nShe can do other pre or post wedding activities with you where her dad isn't there", "NTA\n\nHonestly my brain can't comprehend your sister's behaviour and honestly I hate the 'but he's/she's your \"parent\"'.\n\nMy father was emotionally and physically abusive moreso with my Mum, I felt guilty I used to get \"but he's your dad\". I no longer have contact and everyone who tells me \"but he's your dad\" gets told the abusive shit he used to do.\n\nIf I had to choose between my sister or the father that abused her, I am choosing my Sister every fucking time.\n\nI don't give a flying fuck if he was nice to me.\n\nLook after your OP don't set yourself on fire to keep her warm.", "Your sister is mega asshole. That man purposely looked for someone in your mom's situation so he could have a victim that was easy to go after and thought he would be able to do that forever. Now your sister is acting like you're harming her by correctly refusing to be around him.\n\n>My sister got mad and started to say I needed to let it go and why can't I just accept she loves him.\n\nShe'd be gone to me. I wouldn't love her anymore.", "Make it about her. \n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be spending your wedding day worried about keeping my childhood abuser away from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that he will cause a huge scene and ruin your wedding if I\u2019m there to target.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to be there for you at your wedding shower and bachelorette.

It\u2019s not the fact that you \u201ccan\u2019t accept that she loves him\u201d, it\u2019s the abuse.

Don\u2019t go.\n\nIs your mother going to the wedding with that monster there?", "Your sister is a bit confused.  Yes she loves you both but what her dad did to you is reprehensible and it seems he's shown no remorse for his actions.

She thinks you can just let it go but obviously she's never experienced trauma.  \n\nNTA but your sister is for her lack of compassion", "NTA. Your sister has some serious growing up to do.

If your sister calms down you might want to offer that as an olive branch...\n\nBut you are absolutely correct to avoid a wedding reception with this hateful jerk present.

But she needs to understand that inviting him holds the very reasonable consequence of you not being there. There's no negotiation to be had here.", "Definitely NTA. No matter how much you cared for your sister - voluntarily immersing yourself in those horrible memories cannot be justified by your love for her. \n\n  \nAnd even if you had found the strength to go to that wedding, the aftermath of that encounter would not let you breathe freely for a long time afterward.   \nAlways choose yourself when it comes to your mental health.   \nYou did the right thing.

You are not doing this out hate but your own much needed boundaries.\n\nAlthough she may understand what he did to you, she didn\u2019t experience it, that kind of attitude is at some level lack of empathy intentionally or unintentionally.

But he did everything to make it seem like he was this perfect guy.", "\"despite it being his favored child\u2019s wedding\"\n\nI'm sorry to say, it's his ONLY child. He doesn't view OP as his child. How he could have married her mom knowing how he felt, I'll never understand.", "She was too little when it was happening so she doesn't remember it. Except for the incident when I was 14. So no, she never called him out or anything that I'm aware of.", "If it's the one someone linked in these comments, yeah they're similar but also completely different", "NTA OP, but your sister is not better than that man (at least not right now). Your sister needs to understand that her wedding is only important to her, is not a big event is YOUR life. For your own mental health you should block her and whoever sides with her. \n\n\"Hey sis, I know you love and respect that man who for years emotionally abused me and is the reason of many traumas and the amount of time and money I've spent in therapy, I just hope you don't keep following his steps of being emotionally abusive towards me and give me a little bit of the respect he never did\".", "I just want to say that, \u201cit\u2019s not hate, it\u2019s trauma\u201d is a fantastic explanation. You are smart to stay away.", "Seems like he blamed you for anything he didn't like with his life, so I wouldn't take that seriously. Flat tire three years after the divorce? Definitively BadOk7232's fault!", "Sometimes I wonder if he would take it out on me back then too. But I was too young to remember and he was good at hiding it from everyone. Also possible he thought mom would send me away once they had their own kid.", "Yeah, the guilt trip, trying manipulate OP into going to the wedding, risking her well being, and allowing sister to pretend all the trauma her dad caused to her sister didn't happen is a rotten apple fallen at the base of a rotten tree.", "Pretty much. All because I was someone else's child.", "My heart breaks for you. I cannot imagine ever treating a child that way. I can understand why you wouldn't want to ever be in the same room or area with him.", "It's bad for your sister. But it is very logical that you cannot live with her father. And for telling your sister to just get over the trauma is an ass. That's not how things work", "Never understood why people get so obsessed with blood relation. In my extended family, if you're family, you're family. Doesn't matter if you're an in law or a stepchild of a family member, you're family. I didn't even know one of my cousins wasn't related by blood until I was older because my extended family never treated them any different. You deserved better.", "He found it repulsive and found me repulsive. There was something that bothered him about the fact I didn't have his blood and I know he would have been that way with any kid my mom had without him. But as a kid it was hard not to see myself as repulsive. Or to think everyone would be better off with me dead."]}
