She was talking our mom and me about her wedding and she was saying her dad would be there. Mom and her dad were together from the time I was a baby until I was 8. He was horrifically cruel to me for years and hated me for being mom's kid with someone else even though he started dating a single mom. For years it was done behind my mom's back but when I told her what was happening and she confronted him, he showed everyone around how disgusting he was to me. He left me with a lot of issues. I had no dad and he was as close as I had and he made it very clear he would never want to be my anything dad. Mom divorced him and there was a custody dispute because mom didn't want him turning my sister against me. My sister saw her dad every other weekend but she also needed to be in therapy for years because the court agreed there was a risk that he would try to poison our relationship. He also needed to stay far away from me. The last time I saw him I was 14 and he showed up to pick up my sister when he wasn't supposed to and I was home alone for a couple of hours. He was just as cruel to me at the door that time as he was when he was married to my mom. He accused me of destroying my sister's family and being poison. When mom came home with my sister they found me crying and distraught and struggling. \n\nI have had extensive therapy from the age of 8. It hasn't been ongoing every week since I was 8. But I needed a lot of help and still have some hang ups from everything.\n\nI cannot be around that man. \n\nBut my sister loves her dad and wants her there so after she told us about this and I know the wedding is happening in March, I told my sister that I could not go. She begged me not to do that and said she could just keep me away from her dad or maybe she could even get him to apologize. I told her that he destroyed me and I cannot be around him again. She asked me to love her more than I hate her dad. I said it's not even hate. It's trauma. He tormented a little girl for simply not being his when he married mom knowing she had me. I told her that the man used to wish a child dead for simply existing in a way he didn't like.\n\nMom told my sister that she needed to respect the fact her dad had done so much harm and it was not something I could just get over. My sister cried that she loves me and her dad and she doesn't want to have one not be there on her big day. Mom said if I was a minor she would have made the choice for me and would have done the same thing.\n\nMy sister got mad and started to say I needed to let it go and why can't I just accept she loves him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695711522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sgk6h/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_cant_come_to_her/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom did the right thing and continues to do so. \n\nI was giving your sister a lot of grace, but this ***\"My sister got mad and started to say I needed to let it go and why can't I just accept she loves him.\"*** was way over line.

And your sister is the asshole for saying to just get over trauma. Mthat is not how things work", "NTA Your sister is young. She simply doesn't understand. You politely let her know you'd have to decline an invitation to her wedding. If she wants to sulk and pout, so be it. You have made your decision and it's final.", "NTA, absolutely not. Your sister is never going to get it - to fully believe your experience would crush the imaginary father she thinks she has.", "NTA.  Only a selfish little girl chooses her daddy over his innocent victim.", ">maybe she could even get him to apologize\n\nFat chance! This girl clearly doesn't live in the real world  where her dad is concerned. He's a monster. If I grew up with a dad that treated any other child that way (let alone my half-sibling), I would want nothing to do with him.\n\nClearly it's more important to her that her daddy dearest is at her wedding than it is to respect your feelings or acknowledge their validity. The fact she's the one telling you to \"let it go\" tells you all you need to know. One of these days she will have to learn that everything isn't about her. \n\nBTW, he's now succeeding in poisoning her against you, except she's grown now so that's kinda on her.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI'm glad your mom sees your side.\n\nIt sounds like she really looked out for you - quickly splitting with him, getting you both therapy, keeping you separate from him as much as possible. And, though your sister clearly doesn't get it, I'm very glad she values you in her way. It sounds like therapy was successful in preventing the relationship from being poisoned.\n\nIf your sister won't budge, you may be able to offer to connect with her in a different way, in order to drive the point home that your issue is not with her but with her father. Your sister is also NTA; it's understandable that she wants her valued family members to all be present. Her judgment on valuing that man is questionable, but she's still young and doesn't seem to grasp it.\n\nThe AH here is, and had always been, her father. From her reaction to your refusal, it sounds like she may have a chance to really begin to absorb the gravity of his behavior towards you.\n\nI wish you luck, OP.", "NTA \n\n>I cannot be around that man. \n\nThat's all she needs to listen to.", "Wasn't this already posted and deleted becsuse you didn't like people told you YTA??\n\n\n He is her father who loves her and whom she loves.

I'm a stepmother, and I couldn't imagine treating my bonus kid this way. You have to protect yourself and mental health even if it's hurts some feelings. Your sister is being unreasonable and selfish. I'm sure she just wants you to be there, but that's no excuse to pressure you. Skip the wedding and protect your peace.", "NTA, your sister needs to understand that her dad caused this situation.", "NTA...\n\nPretty disappointing that she continued to have a relationship with her dad, knowing how she treated you... but she was a kid too, so that's forgivable...\n\n**But she's well into AH land now... she's 22, an adult... and blaming the victim because they won't get over their YEARS of trauma...**\n\n*\"My sister got mad and started to say I needed to let it go...\"*\n\nShe owes you an huge apology for this... hopefully, she was just emotional in the moment, thinking this way... if she apologizes, forgive her... if she doesn't, going LC/NC might be the way...\n\nBe sure to show her this post; I expect she's going to be judged harshly... maybe it'll get her to wake the fuck up and understand that **her father's behaviour was fucking monstrous and unforgivable...**", "NTA. You *do* accept that she loves him. That's why you removed yourself from the situation instead of making her choose.\n\nReality is messy, we can't always get what we want. Your sister wants you both there on her special day, but she can't have that. She's selfish and cruel if she thinks you attending her party is more important than keeping you away from your abuser.\n\nIt might be her day, but your mental health is *not* all about her. If she can't understand how hurtful her father was/is, if she wants you to do something she knows will hurt you to make her happy, if she's actively trying to guilt and manipulate you into thinking things won't be like they've always been before?

And how naive for sister to think that SHE alone could get her father to stay away from you or apologise. \ud83d\ude44\n\nI understand that she\u2019s in a difficult position and wants her loved ones there, but she needs to respect how you feel. She needs to start understanding and accepting why one won\u2019t be there. I\u2019d say it would have to be you whom stays away because, given how you\u2019ve written about your family dynamics, HE\u2019S not going to be offering to stay home. \ud83d\ude33\n\nZOOM might be an option for you to see her get married but not be there in person.

She's fine with what her father did.", "Yes, in the end I need to take care of me and the wedding would be doing the opposite.", "I did a lot of reading on that in my teens and it made me so sad for those people. My mom still carries the guilt that she never noticed or realized what he was doing herself. But nobody in my life did. They all thought he was a great guy. He was really charismatic and he appeared like the friendliest guy you could meet. People thought he was amazing. But when it slipped he really showed what was underneath. Mom never considered staying with him either and never ever blamed me for it. I know that happens in some families too. The parent leaves but resents the kid.", "It's not but she doesn't fully get it. In some ways she does but in stuff like this she just doesn't understand how it can carry for a long time.

He probably resented you even more after the divorce and I guarantee if you go to that wedding he will have you crying in a corner again, despite it being his favored child\u2019s wedding. You are protecting yourself by not going. \n\nTell your sister just that. \u201cI am not going to be attending your wedding. This is because I have to protect myself from your father. This is nothing to do with you, this is a grown woman protecting herself from a former abuser. I wish you the best with your wedding and would love to celebrate over lunch(or something) once you get back from your honeymoon.\u201d", "Oh, I'm aware of that.

You didn't try and create drama or tell her it's  me or him and put her in the middle, you bowed out. Class move.", "I think he would too. It's not like he walked away when he realized my mom and sister weren't home that day when I was 14. He decided he was going to make me feel shitty all over again.", "I think so too. He blamed me for the divorce. At no point did he think I would tell and he expected to get away with it for the rest of his life. At some point I think he would have pushed me too far and I would have left and would have been too afraid to say anything."]}
