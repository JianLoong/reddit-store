I didn't say anything though as I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. After a couple of months of seeing no progress though, I quietly bought her the same exact dress in a larger size. \n\nCome this past week, she called me in tears saying that she didn't think that she could fit into her bridesmaid dress and felt horrible for ruining the dress code.

She said that my doubt was offensive and that I must have been planning for this to happen. I told her that I just cared about her, and obviously wouldn't have mentioned the dress if she had lost the weight. But she herself brought up that she couldn't fit in her current dress, so I wasn't sure what she's mad about. \n\nShe's now threatening to drop out of the wedding party, and some of our mutual friends think I was kind of an AH for not being supportive enough.

I bought a backup bridesmaids dress for my ladies (were all roughly the same size and its stretchy) just in case....and ended up needing it because one of the others came in the wrong color and we didn't notice until they were side by side! Weddings are stressful enough, if you can afford it, a backup relieves a little stress.", "NTA, \n\nshe may be insecure about her weight. she wanted to look beautiful at your wedding and now it may not feel that way. Perhaps it could be helpful if you let her know that the dress looked so beautiful on her and that you wanted to be sure that the dress was still there if she was unable to lose the weight.\n\nanyway, you sound like a great friend and certainly not a bridezilla.", "NTA. Sadly I think this goes deeper than just wedding issues and it\u2019s entirely possible your friend has an eating disorder (whether she\u2019s aware of it or not). Her brain will be telling her all sorts of things about her moral failure of failing to lose enough weight and you\u2019re just sadly caught in the crossfire of the way she feels about herself. I would be gentle with her and gentle with yourself too. You didn\u2019t do a bad thing, and her misplaced anger is unfair but also very likely something she doesn\u2019t have full control of. I hope she can get the support she needs to heal soon", "She's only angry because she feels ashamed, embarrassed, and humiliated, so she's directing her feelings towards you. It's just displaced anger at herself. Tell her you understand her feelings and will respect her decision, but you hope she will stay on as bridesmaid as she is important to you.", "NTA\n\nTop comments are right: Give her space (say, \"Just let me know by...\" if you are close to the date) and accept her choice; don't get sucked into her drama. Maybe even give her a choice: she can wear the dress you bought for her or she can try to find a dress on her own, subject to you approving it. (I don't know how much flexibility you gave the bridesmaids in their choice of dress or if any other dress would clearly be out of place among the others.)\n\nYour friend has a fierce need to believe in her fantasy that she can achieve unrealistic and unsustainable goals for her weight. As much as she may love you as a friend, she NEEDS to prop up her fantasy more.\n\nIt would be great if she could see her own actions more objectively, but it's a lot easier for her to decide that your actions were unkind/unsupportive...\n\nAs for those mutual friends... ugh!!! (1) I'm sorry. What would have been the appropriate supportive action in their mind? Be fairly confident your friend was NOT going to reach her target weight and let her scramble to find something that fit her and fit your wedding? You did actually give her time to show some results and didn't take any backup action until the facts made it clear that the odds were against her. You still didn't mention anything to her, in case she pulled off a miracle. I don't know if *those* friends are (1) enablers or flying monkeys or (2) also have their own fantasies they are invested in maintaining.\n\nBack to you: don't let friend (or her champions) drama spoil your wedding. Her emotions are hers to manage. There's not a lot you can do to (1) make her see the logic and the kindness of your actions or (2) soothe her emotion issues around her weight. You are giving her space; you are also giving yourself space from her.", "I think you were supportive as hell. And as another commenter observed, if this was you \"not believing in her\", then...I mean, you were right. She couldn't do it. This is simply her finding someone to get angry at so she can avoid feeling angry at herself. NTA.", "NTA and you're actually a good friend. You kept quiet, but wanted to be accommodating in case her plan failed. I think that's incredibly thoughtful.\n\nIt seems to me that she is lashing out because of her issue with her weight, and she needs to own up to that and apologize. Right now, she's throwing a tantrum. I would understand if you didn't have the energy to deal with this drama and call her bluff of not attending.\n\nAs for your \"friends\" who say you weren't being supportive enough: Ask them what specifically you should have done different in their opinion. \n\n- Try to dissuade her from the smaller size? You don't believe in her, you're being discouraging. \n- Ask her about her progress? You're being pushy and judgmental, you only care about how your wedding party is going to look, why don't you be more understanding and supportive?\n- Allow her to use wear something else? Now she's going to stand out, you're shining a spotlight on her not managing to fit into the dress all the other bridesmaids are wearing, you're embarrassing her.\n\nPoint is: With how she's dealing with her lack of weight loss, there was no way for her not to flip her shit. She was going to be upset in every conceivable scenario.\n\nYou did good.

You WERE supportive because you let her buy the smaller dress in the hopes that she would fulfill her personal goal. You didn't try to talk her out of it, nor did you remind her throughout the months that she needed to try to fit in the purchased dress. You quietly and discreetly took action once you saw that she wasn't meeting any of her goals.\n\nI think that she actually lashed out at you because she is mad at herself.

You obviously have a lot going on now with your wedding (I assume) but maybe you could find the time to try and figure out the root of your friend's eating habit problem or suggest she seeks out help. Don't just come at her with the \"you should see a therapist\" but try to steer the conversation in that direction. She needs help.\n\nI hope you two manage to smooth things out before the wedding and that she accepts the dress which you so kindly bought for her.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA- it was so thoughtful of you", "NTA and honestly I wish I would have done this. Two of my bridesmaids bought dresses that were too small and didn\u2019t fit in them when my wedding came. \n\nNeither told me about it until like 2 days before the wedding, so it was too late to find different dresses.  Another of my bridesmaids thankfully wasn\u2019t sure which dress she would like and ordered two. Then never got around to returning one, so one of them wore her extra dress, which was too big. The other wore really tight spanx to fit into the dress she ordered. \n\nBoth had to change into different clothes for the reception, which was fine but the pictures are a bit odd because it\u2019s very obvious they changed clothes.", "I think you know her better than she thinks.

You saw that she wasn\u2019t losing the weight, so you made a backup plan, while hoping your friend would teach her goals.  She called you in a panic, and you offered the alternate dress, and she calls YOU unsupportive?  No.  You were supportive even when you thought her goals were unrealistic.

Having to call you and tell you of her inability to lose weight was something that she felt was humiliating. This is what crushed her to react the way she did. It\u2019s not because you bought an extra dress. It was a nice gesture. \n\nPerhaps you could have reworded it to something like \u201cI bought an extra dress because I wanted to avoid any last minute issues since the dress was selling fast. You\u2019re more than welcome to it but to make sure it would accommodate anyone, I bought it in a bigger size so you\u2019d have to have it altered.\u201d She may have still reacted the same way but she may not thought it a personal attack.", "NTA.  She\u2019s being ridiculous.", "NTA. Some people are sensitive about their weight. I would try to explain again that it wasn't about her.

Congratulations on your wedding.", "NTA, I agree with everyone saying give her space. \n\nHowever, I do find it odd that she overreacted to you being prepared that she wouldn't fit into the dress. It just sent up a red flag because I used to have a friend who when she didn't want to wear something would purposely buy it in the wrong size, wait until the last minute, and then say just apologize and say it was a mistake and then she would wear what she wanted to wear the whole time. She confided in me that it was a strategy she used all the time. \n\nMaybe think back if this has happened before and if it is a pattern.

I also had to forgo a lot of initial pictures because of it.\n\nIf I had to do it again and had your brilliant idea, I absolutely would have done the same thing.", "It\u2019s your wedding, not her weight control therapy session.

Give her a little time. Make sure she knows that her presence is appreciated and important whatever her dress size is. Congratulations and good luck. NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s really sad that your friend is so invested in weight loss especially since there are not a lot of guaranteed ways to lose a lot of weight. Losing 10 lbs temporarily is fairly straight forward but evidence suggests that losing large amounts of weight and keeping it off for more than 1-2 years is unlikely. 3 dress sizes is A LOT of weight to lose. Depending on her height that could be 50-75 lbs. That could take more than a year and even then it simply might not happen. Some of us just don\u2019t lose weight no matter how hard we try. \n\nIt\u2019s not entirely her fault but it is not your fault at all. You should tell her that her body issues are not your problem and that you wish she could be happy/content with her body. She doesn\u2019t need to lose weight. And you don\u2019t have to support her dieting. I have some books and podcasts I could suggest that might help her on a journey toward body acceptance and eventually body love.", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t take her reaction personally. She\u2019s probably angry and frustrated at herself. I have lived that yo-yo diet life and it\u2019s a vicious cycle. \nI think it sounds like you\u2019ve been a supportive and good friend and hopefully y\u2019all can talk after she cools down. \nAnd if she doesn\u2019t, maybe it time to cool off your friendship. Best of luck.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to drop a bad friend. TAKE IT and don\u2019t look back. A bad friend will always make you pay for keeping them in your life. \n\nYou mention you guys never fought. Keep in mind fighting or not fighting is not an indication of a good or bad friendship. Bad friends tend to get along with you just fine until something like this reveals their true character on occasions like these when it involves something entirely about you. \n\nLet her drop out of your wedding and your life. Don\u2019t miss this opportunity to get rid of her.", "NTA. You are a level headed person who plans for the unknown. You were not being unsupportive, you were being realistic.

I mean if you really wanted to be nice, you could have taken her news about not fitting into the dress, said that you will look, and after a few hours told her that hey presto, you happened to find it in a better size online somewhere!

Can we get this one fitted? \n\nYou give them the chance to be exited without feeling like you didn't have faith in them.  And you've covered your ass.

She could have easily taken it in if she lost weight.", "Don't worry, but have hope for a daughter.   \nIt was also hard to part with my favourite clothes - they landed packed in attic.   \nNow my 13yo daughter is all the time rummaging the box, finding some \"absolute treasures\" ;)  \nThe same with my mum and my niece - she raids grandma's closet and is very happy, finding \"vintage stuff\" ;)", "[Think of your clothing like a time capsule!](https://youtu.be/FzPwrPmRCYw?si=4xfFkBRO2qCQ-qvo)", "My wife has knee socks from her parochial high school uniform as well\u2026she graduated in 1972. Hasn\u2019t worn them in the 51 years I\u2019ve known her\u2026but she has them\u2026not my problem though.", "Probably not just women.\n\nI've still got a stash of fitted tops and jeans that will fit/look a lot better when I've lost some of the belly I've gained over the last decade.\n\nTo make it worthwhile, I am actually losing it and getting back into some of them fairly well. It's worth keeping stuff if you are going to get back into it.", "The BM is crazy to blame her inability to lose a fantastic amount of weight on OP. OP did nothing to discourage her but just was realistic and covered all bases. Before OP's suggestion, she was actually \"felt horrible for ruining the dress code\"", "Honestly this. What you did by buying your dress in your size is so sensible. You can always alter your dress to be smaller if you lose weight, it's almost impossible to alter a smaller dress and make it bigger. The BM should've just bought the dress in her size, aimed to lose weight like she wanted to, and if she lost the weight - great! Alter the dress just before the wedding. If you don't lose the weight, no big deal. \n\nIt's not on the bride to have to change everything around for the BM, that's not how it works.", "Happy Cake Day!! \ud83c\udf82", "My husband and I just moved overseas and I made him donate all of his shirts and slacks that he wasn\u2019t going to fit back into. We\u2019re about to have our first baby and he\u2019s put on a little sympathy weight, I had to break it to him that he probably won\u2019t lose his belly the way I will lose mine and that\u2019s okay! Because we\u2019re happy and in love haha.", "If we are being honest she is embarrassed and choosing to mask with rage and anger \ud83d\ude21.\n\nOP: NTA. Have a sit down with her and call her on her BS. Let her know that you bought the dress as a back up in case she did not reach her goal of dropping 3 sizes because it is much easier to take a dress in than take a dress out.", "In fact I was between sizes on that model and I chose the bigger one (not like anyone would see the size anyway) The seamstress in alterations at the bridal boutique told me, the only way to make my lacey A-line dress one size bigger would be to get rid of the buttons in the back and sew in lacing instead.  It might have worked but while the lacing would add a couple of centimetres it wouldn't change the structure of the dress so it might become ill fitting especially on the bust. And I really loved the buttons all the way down, so there was no way I would risk that.", "I actually did the opposite. After finally succeeding in losing weight properly with healthy eating and exercise after years of yoyo dieting, I was so convinced I was going to backslide that I flat refused to get rid of my larger clothes. I  thought I was going to get out of bed one day and be like  the nutty professor and blow up overnight and have nothing to wear. Even now I buy all my clothes two sizes up"]}
