I didn't say anything though as I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. After a couple of months of seeing no progress though, I quietly bought her the same exact dress in a larger size. \n\nCome this past week, she called me in tears saying that she didn't think that she could fit into her bridesmaid dress and felt horrible for ruining the dress code.

She said that my doubt was offensive and that I must have been planning for this to happen. I told her that I just cared about her, and obviously wouldn't have mentioned the dress if she had lost the weight. But she herself brought up that she couldn't fit in her current dress, so I wasn't sure what she's mad about. \n\nShe's now threatening to drop out of the wedding party, and some of our mutual friends think I was kind of an AH for not being supportive enough.

I bought a backup bridesmaids dress for my ladies (were all roughly the same size and its stretchy) just in case....and ended up needing it because one of the others came in the wrong color and we didn't notice until they were side by side! Weddings are stressful enough, if you can afford it, a backup relieves a little stress.", "NTA, \n\nshe may be insecure about her weight. she wanted to look beautiful at your wedding and now it may not feel that way. Perhaps it could be helpful if you let her know that the dress looked so beautiful on her and that you wanted to be sure that the dress was still there if she was unable to lose the weight.\n\nanyway, you sound like a great friend and certainly not a bridezilla.", "NTA. Sadly I think this goes deeper than just wedding issues and it\u2019s entirely possible your friend has an eating disorder (whether she\u2019s aware of it or not). Her brain will be telling her all sorts of things about her moral failure of failing to lose enough weight and you\u2019re just sadly caught in the crossfire of the way she feels about herself. I would be gentle with her and gentle with yourself too. You didn\u2019t do a bad thing, and her misplaced anger is unfair but also very likely something she doesn\u2019t have full control of. I hope she can get the support she needs to heal soon", "She's only angry because she feels ashamed, embarrassed, and humiliated, so she's directing her feelings towards you. It's just displaced anger at herself. Tell her you understand her feelings and will respect her decision, but you hope she will stay on as bridesmaid as she is important to you.", "NTA\n\nTop comments are right: Give her space (say, \"Just let me know by...\" if you are close to the date) and accept her choice; don't get sucked into her drama. Maybe even give her a choice: she can wear the dress you bought for her or she can try to find a dress on her own, subject to you approving it. (I don't know how much flexibility you gave the bridesmaids in their choice of dress or if any other dress would clearly be out of place among the others.)\n\nYour friend has a fierce need to believe in her fantasy that she can achieve unrealistic and unsustainable goals for her weight. As much as she may love you as a friend, she NEEDS to prop up her fantasy more.\n\nIt would be great if she could see her own actions more objectively, but it's a lot easier for her to decide that your actions were unkind/unsupportive...\n\nAs for those mutual friends... ugh!!! (1) I'm sorry. What would have been the appropriate supportive action in their mind? Be fairly confident your friend was NOT going to reach her target weight and let her scramble to find something that fit her and fit your wedding? You did actually give her time to show some results and didn't take any backup action until the facts made it clear that the odds were against her. You still didn't mention anything to her, in case she pulled off a miracle. I don't know if *those* friends are (1) enablers or flying monkeys or (2) also have their own fantasies they are invested in maintaining.\n\nBack to you: don't let friend (or her champions) drama spoil your wedding. Her emotions are hers to manage. There's not a lot you can do to (1) make her see the logic and the kindness of your actions or (2) soothe her emotion issues around her weight. You are giving her space; you are also giving yourself space from her.", "I think you were supportive as hell. And as another commenter observed, if this was you \"not believing in her\", then...I mean, you were right. She couldn't do it. This is simply her finding someone to get angry at so she can avoid feeling angry at herself. NTA.", "NTA and you're actually a good friend. You kept quiet, but wanted to be accommodating in case her plan failed. I think that's incredibly thoughtful.\n\nIt seems to me that she is lashing out because of her issue with her weight, and she needs to own up to that and apologize. Right now, she's throwing a tantrum. I would understand if you didn't have the energy to deal with this drama and call her bluff of not attending.\n\nAs for your \"friends\" who say you weren't being supportive enough: Ask them what specifically you should have done different in their opinion. \n\n- Try to dissuade her from the smaller size? You don't believe in her, you're being discouraging. \n- Ask her about her progress? You're being pushy and judgmental, you only care about how your wedding party is going to look, why don't you be more understanding and supportive?\n- Allow her to use wear something else? Now she's going to stand out, you're shining a spotlight on her not managing to fit into the dress all the other bridesmaids are wearing, you're embarrassing her.\n\nPoint is: With how she's dealing with her lack of weight loss, there was no way for her not to flip her shit. She was going to be upset in every conceivable scenario.\n\nYou did good.

You WERE supportive because you let her buy the smaller dress in the hopes that she would fulfill her personal goal. You didn't try to talk her out of it, nor did you remind her throughout the months that she needed to try to fit in the purchased dress. You quietly and discreetly took action once you saw that she wasn't meeting any of her goals.\n\nI think that she actually lashed out at you because she is mad at herself.

You obviously have a lot going on now with your wedding (I assume) but maybe you could find the time to try and figure out the root of your friend's eating habit problem or suggest she seeks out help. Don't just come at her with the \"you should see a therapist\" but try to steer the conversation in that direction. She needs help.\n\nI hope you two manage to smooth things out before the wedding and that she accepts the dress which you so kindly bought for her.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA- it was so thoughtful of you", "NTA and honestly I wish I would have done this. Two of my bridesmaids bought dresses that were too small and didn\u2019t fit in them when my wedding came. \n\nNeither told me about it until like 2 days before the wedding, so it was too late to find different dresses.  Another of my bridesmaids thankfully wasn\u2019t sure which dress she would like and ordered two. Then never got around to returning one, so one of them wore her extra dress, which was too big. The other wore really tight spanx to fit into the dress she ordered. \n\nBoth had to change into different clothes for the reception, which was fine but the pictures are a bit odd because it\u2019s very obvious they changed clothes.", "I think you know her better than she thinks.

You saw that she wasn\u2019t losing the weight, so you made a backup plan, while hoping your friend would teach her goals.  She called you in a panic, and you offered the alternate dress, and she calls YOU unsupportive?  No.  You were supportive even when you thought her goals were unrealistic.

Having to call you and tell you of her inability to lose weight was something that she felt was humiliating. This is what crushed her to react the way she did. It\u2019s not because you bought an extra dress. It was a nice gesture. \n\nPerhaps you could have reworded it to something like \u201cI bought an extra dress because I wanted to avoid any last minute issues since the dress was selling fast. You\u2019re more than welcome to it but to make sure it would accommodate anyone, I bought it in a bigger size so you\u2019d have to have it altered.\u201d She may have still reacted the same way but she may not thought it a personal attack.", "NTA.  She\u2019s being ridiculous.", "NTA. Some people are sensitive about their weight. I would try to explain again that it wasn't about her.

Congratulations on your wedding.", "NTA, I agree with everyone saying give her space. \n\nHowever, I do find it odd that she overreacted to you being prepared that she wouldn't fit into the dress. It just sent up a red flag because I used to have a friend who when she didn't want to wear something would purposely buy it in the wrong size, wait until the last minute, and then say just apologize and say it was a mistake and then she would wear what she wanted to wear the whole time. She confided in me that it was a strategy she used all the time. \n\nMaybe think back if this has happened before and if it is a pattern.

I also had to forgo a lot of initial pictures because of it.\n\nIf I had to do it again and had your brilliant idea, I absolutely would have done the same thing.", "It\u2019s your wedding, not her weight control therapy session.

Give her a little time. Make sure she knows that her presence is appreciated and important whatever her dress size is. Congratulations and good luck. NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s really sad that your friend is so invested in weight loss especially since there are not a lot of guaranteed ways to lose a lot of weight. Losing 10 lbs temporarily is fairly straight forward but evidence suggests that losing large amounts of weight and keeping it off for more than 1-2 years is unlikely. 3 dress sizes is A LOT of weight to lose. Depending on her height that could be 50-75 lbs. That could take more than a year and even then it simply might not happen. Some of us just don\u2019t lose weight no matter how hard we try. \n\nIt\u2019s not entirely her fault but it is not your fault at all. You should tell her that her body issues are not your problem and that you wish she could be happy/content with her body. She doesn\u2019t need to lose weight. And you don\u2019t have to support her dieting. I have some books and podcasts I could suggest that might help her on a journey toward body acceptance and eventually body love.", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t take her reaction personally. She\u2019s probably angry and frustrated at herself. I have lived that yo-yo diet life and it\u2019s a vicious cycle. \nI think it sounds like you\u2019ve been a supportive and good friend and hopefully y\u2019all can talk after she cools down. \nAnd if she doesn\u2019t, maybe it time to cool off your friendship. Best of luck.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to drop a bad friend. TAKE IT and don\u2019t look back. A bad friend will always make you pay for keeping them in your life. \n\nYou mention you guys never fought. Keep in mind fighting or not fighting is not an indication of a good or bad friendship. Bad friends tend to get along with you just fine until something like this reveals their true character on occasions like these when it involves something entirely about you. \n\nLet her drop out of your wedding and your life. Don\u2019t miss this opportunity to get rid of her.", "NTA. You are a level headed person who plans for the unknown. You were not being unsupportive, you were being realistic.

I mean if you really wanted to be nice, you could have taken her news about not fitting into the dress, said that you will look, and after a few hours told her that hey presto, you happened to find it in a better size online somewhere!

Can we get this one fitted? \n\nYou give them the chance to be exited without feeling like you didn't have faith in them.  And you've covered your ass.

When they insisted on ordering a dress a size smaller than we recommended we would secretly order the correct size, then cut the size tag out when it arrived.

I really want this dress code too so if you do not have a dress that fits, we will need to discuss another role for you other than bridesmaid. Then let her decide her choices. If she still proceeds, she will then have a consequence to deal with.  The consequence may not be what either of you want too but undermining her journey is really devastating. \n\nOr alternatively, accept your friend for her struggles and not have the dress code.

Your friend was inconsiderate to buy a dress that was too small to fit her and expect that she would magically lose weight without changing her lifestyle.  What she did was selfish and short sighted.  It wasn't the best move to buy a dress for her that was realistic, but if you would have tried to talk to her about the inappropriately sized dress any earlier, she would have had the same blow up.  Still, the talk probably should have happened earlier and her role in the wedding or her dress size should have been sorted by now.  You have a larger dress.

I have XL shirts that fit oversized and comfy, and XL shirts that are two sizes two small, and medium shirts that still fit perfectly.

Why was her desire to diet more important than her desire to be in the wedding party? She's done this for years and she failed at the ridiculous and unnecessary task she gave herself. So YOU'RE the bad guy for actually accepting her body as it is and buying a dress that fits, instead of a \"motivator?\"\n\nShe needs to get over herself and her need to have all this attention and sympathy. No one told her to make your wedding about her weight. Common sense tells you to buy what fits and have it taken in if needed.

Elle was able to buy a second dress in a much, much smaller size, dismantled both the original and the tiny one, and cut full-length strips out of the tiny one to put in as panels down the sides of the original.\n\nI would applaud the resourcefulness, but the execution wasn't good. Hems didn't match, the needle she'd used was the wrong size for the weight of the fabric so the seams along the side panels were puckered, and she hadn't accounted for the tailoring around the strapless bodice so the shape was wrong and no longer supported itself, so she'd used more of the tiny dress to make straps. Which weren't straight. Or the same length. And one of them was twisted.\n\nAnd the bride knew nothing about this until the morning of the wedding day.

As a consultant, I would have been trying super hard to get her to not go more than a size or two down because she would likely end up having problems and blaming the store, which they inevitably do despite warnings and contracts about how they were advised. For the bride to actually not mention it to the BM, order a backup, and not ask her to pay for it, is above and beyond what I've ever seen any bride do to be considerate of their friend's unrealistic goal.

I had a bridesmaid do the EXACT same thing. Only she didn't tell me she'd ordered the wrong size until 3 weeks before my wedding when it didn't fit. I had 4 bridesmaids all in identical dresses that took 8 weeks to order in! They were a pale green with ivory sashes. She was MOH and the only thing I could think to do was get her an ivory dress and have a matching sash made out of her green dress so she was inverted. I had to buy her a cheap wedding dress and then have it taken up to knee length so it didn't look like a wedding dress. Which meant having the 4 other dresses taken up as well so they matched. And the seamstress that was recommended to me completely botched them up. None of them were straight and the sashes were cut way shorter than i asked so they stuck out like little stumps. One dress was so bad my MIL was unpicking it the night before and redoing the hem to try and salvage it. The MOH is question is my SIL and 14 years later I still haven't fully forgiven her. She'd done the same thing with her wedding dress a year before and nearly messed up her own wedding. I couldn't believe she'd do the same thing to me knowing how it had gone before.

I would totally understand if you dont want to, because the way your friend behaves is ridiculous, unfair and unbelievably manipulating.  \nTo the perspective:  \nYour friend set herself a weight goal she did not reach. I, having struggled a lot with my weight all my life, being overweight, believe she might be deeply ashamed about her weight. She probably told your shared friends that she will loose the weight until your wedding and how amazing she will look, just like the other bridesmaids (who i assume are all a smaller size, than she is currently. Though their actual size doesnt really matter)  \nShe also told this to herself and envisioned herself in the dress that is 3 sizes smaller than she currently is.  \nNow she feels bad about herself, ashamed and probably like a failure. And instead of being able to communicate that and deal with her feelings properly, she lashes out at you.  \nWhy is she lashing out:  \nI assume she is so anxious about not having lost the weight and feeling so ashamed that she thought that opting out of the wedding would spare her the embarrassment (she feels herself) to show up as \"fat her\" at the wedding, bc she would not be able to get a new dress.  \nIt would be emotionally easier to just not go, instead of showing up in a way she dislikes and has not envisioned for herself.  \nNow by having the dress in the right size, you make this move - where she looks a bit like a martyr and is \"the bigger person\" for not ruining your color scheme/ dress code by just not attending - impossible. So she has no real reason to \"opt out\" anymore without looking like an asshole. So instead of coping with her feelings of self hatred and feeling backed in a corner, she does (probably unconciously) another thing: She blames you and creates drama and a fight, so she has a reason to not attend the wedding.  \nIts childish behaviour and totally uncalled for and you should NOT have to deal with this kind of drama from her or your friends who support her. This is on her and her alone.  \nYou can do 2 things:  \n1. Uninvite her completely, because she is behaving like a rude brat and you dont need this drama around your wedding.  \n2. Meet her. Hug her. Tell her you love her and you only bought the dress, bc you could see her struggle and you wanted to make it easier for her to be able to attend the wedding and be a part of the wedding party, bc you really want her there. Try to make her open up and talk about her feelings around her weight.   \nAs i said above: You are NTA and would be NTA for uninviting her, but maybe you love her and will forgive her for causing this drama and want to stay friends with her.

If she had just made up literally any excuse for how she could get a dress and everyone is happy.", "NTA - it's called risk mitigation!", "You did a good thing. She\u2019s angry because she\u2019s embarrassed that you already this would be the outcome of her small dress fiasco. Don\u2019t beg her to change her mind because it seems she wants to be involved in some drama concerning your wedding.", "NTA so what if she drops out, be glad. She\u2019s not a nice person to get mad at you.", "Let me see if  have this right. You, wanting your old and good friend at you wedding, and knowing she was a yo-yo dieter, took the precaution of buying her a second dress in case she couldn't fit into the first, and when that eventuality came true, gave her a second dress so she wouldn't be left out or look off.  Out of the kindness of your heart.\n\nAnd she got miffed?\n\nNTA and she's being ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nShe, in fact, did not lose the weight.", "Honestly OP you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. She\u2019s just looking for someone to be pissed at because she realises how stupid she was. Don\u2019t be her emotional punching bag. Let the drama queen have her tantrum and remove herself, do you really want someone with her attitude at your wedding? \n\nNTA. I hope she grows up and apologises. Because she owes you a massive apology", "Eahh- this is a wedding, and this was a stupid idea of the friend to attempt to pull off when the stakes were so high as to \" I'm panicking because I can't find a dress in the actual size I am and may be kicked out of the bridal party for not wearing the required dress and/or demoted to guest and have to explain why.\"\n\nThat is all really shitty behavior. Could OP be graceful? I guess - but nothing in the friend's selfish behavior warrants that.", "Yeah, especially when you're in display in a custom dress in front of the assembled guests!", "Nope. Way too charitable. OP's friend should not have made her personal life change based on her friend's wedding. She chose to put her own body weight issues ahead of being a good bridesmaid to OP. That's selfish as hell.", "But this is not friend's wedding. It's OP's. This is beyond the time for white lies. OP's friend could have thrown the bridal party arrangements into chaos had OP not done what she did and told her immediately, forced a different dress in to the scheme, or been demoted to a guest and have to explain that she was a selfish idiot and couldn't buy the right size dress. OR, the friend stands there looking like a 5 pound sausage shoved into a \n1 pound casing and felt humiliated.  The crisis was averted only because of OP's  kindness, but it was all the friend's making. This is not a situation where the friend made a small mistake or became pregnant after the dress was bought, etc. Being selfish should not get rewarded by making a stupid ( and likely seen through) lie.", "I was thinking this was possible . The person who tries an ambitious weight loss plan to show it off at someone else's wedding seems to me the type of attention- seeker who would make this about her in some way.", "Disagree. If this was something unexpected -a pregnancy, or an illness- then sure- lay on the tact. But her friend was selfish as hell by making someone else's wedding about a weight loss goal that was unlikely, then waited to the last minute to then make it the bride's problem to solve ( and what solution would there be that would make OP's day better? Having the selfish friend stand out in a different dress as a reward because of her selfishness? Kicking her out of the bridal party and having to explain why to other guests?  \nNope. OP was plenty tactful, and if the friend doesn't simmer down, no need to keep her in the bridal party at all .", "\"Took away her agency\"? Oh ffs.", "Especially since she's now being blamed for her friend not losing the weight. She's ridiculous and you should let her drop out. This won't be the last drama she pulls because she's full of self-pity. She'll probably complain about being overweight and others looking better than her. Cut the drama off now.

I lost 30kg for my OWN wedding in a year.  But yeah that\u2019s a big ask for someone with lower stakes.  I have been the very chunky bridesmaid twice because I just could not motivate myself to lose weight.", "\"told you so?\" Or \" I'm saving my wedding party because this day is not about your weight loss, get over yourself, no one cares and I have something that will avoid your embarrassment and mine in the event that your plan didn't work which it clearly didn't.\"\n\nWeight loss for someone else's wedding should not take precedence over the bride feeling secure that her bridal party will actually be prepared.", "Yes for ffs!  When someone chooses your clothes for you like you are a 5 year old who can't manage yourself, it's horrible and demeaning and makes someone feel like they can't do anything right. It's similar to what people with difference and disabilities face with people.who are ableist.  Yeah the original lady messed up and it impacted the original poster badly, but planning for that mess up instead of being straightforward with the friend in a kind way is much much worse.", "I also that's a possibility, that she didn't like the chosen dress.", "> maybe she thinks the dress you picked only looks good on skinny girls \n\nOP didn't pick the dress\n\n> The one she picked", "I also hit (and surpassed) my goal weight and all of the shit I had saved over the years is horribly out of style, and I\u2019m getting rid of it! LOL", "I kept my clothes from high school. I did gain weight, but dropped it 3 years ago so they all fit again. My mom is in her 70s & unintentionally lost weight and needs to try to gain weight. She weighs less now than she did 35-40 years ago & is underweight since her diet change/GERD diagnosis.\n\nYou never know, maybe they will fit again for some reason one day.", "I'm not voting YTA or anything. But she knew, or should have known, that revealing \"I knew this would happen and prepared accordingly,\" was going to sting the bridesmaid. Esp because weight is obviously a major source of angst for her.    \n\n\nBridesmaid earned that L, and SHOULD have accepted it with grace since she was clearly the one who messed up.   \n\n\nBut people who get hurt are prone to lash out. And now the bride is still not secure that her bridal party will be intact because she was blunt rather than letting her long-time friend save a little face. Sometimes it's better to say less and just get to the result you want.", "This is someone setting a patently delusional goal and her friend quietly trying to have her back in the event friend did not achieve that goal. Of course the friend feels embarrassed, but this isn't the OP's fault.", "Spot on. She's lashing out bc she's upset with her own failure and sees the back up dress scenario as a reflection of her failure.", "Yes, I was a bridesmaid earlier this year and the dress retailer stressed that you want to order the size that will fit whatever your largest measurement is and have it tailored, and that it was always easier to make a dress smaller than it is to make it bigger. I was between two sizes and went with the larger one and it was fine with alterations (which I\u2019d need to have gotten no matter what because of how short I am).", "Not to mention super uncomfortable. Nothing like being unable to bend down or move my shoulders bc the size or fit is off.", "With any luck, once she's had time to cool off and reconsider, she'll realize she was angry at the wrong person/problem. OP did something nice and reasonable, which made her \"safe\" to be mad at.", "Exactly.", "I don\u2019t often respond to these posts but after reading this I had to. I just wanted to say how lucky anyone would be to have you as a friend. You seem like such a supportive, thoughtful friend who goes above and beyond. You are definitely NTA and I\u2019m really not sure why your mutual friends seem to thank that, but it does sound unfortunately like your friend has some deep rooted issues of insecurity and that\u2019s taking out on you. I\u2019m sorry this is happening at such a significant moment in your life, but I have no doubt. You\u2019ll have the best wedding day ever and have the friends who deserve you \ud83d\udc9c\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "NTA. However, I'd probably try to convey to her that it's not that you didn't believe that she'd lose the weight, it's more that the few months she had are such a tight schedule that it's just so difficult to lose weight like that. No one can realistically have that kind of expectation for themselves, when weight loss is so much more challenging and much more of a life long journey fraught with the inevitable demotivation, relapses, procrastination, etc.", "NTA. I can see her buying one size smaller for a reasonable goal but 3 sizes smaller is just too unrealistic plus she made your wedding about herself.", "I\u2019d say that what you did was a bit wishy washy when it comes to if it was RIGHT or not, but you definitely weren\u2019t in the WRONG. It\u2019s unhealthy to set unrealistic expectations for yourself, and when it could have such big consequences, then I think it was wise to try to make a backup plan. NTA, but I\u2019m not sure I would say this is something you DEFINITELY SHOULD HAVE DONE. (btw, not trying to yell in the caps, just emphasis).", "I guess people are different but I would find it sweet if my friend did this for me.", "You did the right thing we all of grand ideas but they don't always pan out.  Evidently this is a touchy subject for your friend but you really were trying to have a back up plan just in case because you cared and wanted in your wedding regardless of size. She will either figure that out or not.  But you're not the a h", "NTA and you should let her drop out of the wedding party, in fact you should kick her out yourself. This is not what a friend looks like, projecting her poor body image and insecurities on you. You planned for her to get fat? Really? Lol. You didn't believe in her because you knew her, clearly better than she knows herself - which is a testament to the fact that you are in fact an awesome, thoughtful friend.\n\nYour mutual friends are not that great either, by the way. But I guess no good deed goes unpunished...\n\nOr maybe she didn't like the dress code and wanted to wear something completely different, so she bought a much smaller dress on purpose. And you ruined her plan by buying a dress she could actually fit into lol.", "NTA. \n\nIs this a typical bridesmaid dress? What dress shop allowed her to purchase one that small? I bought two sizes larger than I wear to make sure it could be properly tailored to fit me. Even if she had bought her normal size without the intent of losing weight it likely would not have fit her properly.", "NTA but I can understand why your friend is upset. Just tell her you love her no matter what size she is and if she doesn\u2019t come around it is her loss. \n\nMaybe she doesn\u2019t want to be bridesmaid and didn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings. Maybe she doesn\u2019t realise she doesn\u2019t want to be bridesmaid. My friend asked me to be bridesmaid but I said no. \n\nHuGs\ud83d\udc97 to you both.", "NTA. she should be hi 5ing you.", "NTA\n\nI might have phrase it that you know the wedding industry uses 1940s size charts and that 3 sizes smaller in today's sizes is closer to 5 sizes smaller and you wanted to make sure she had a dress that could be altered to fit her.\n\nBut, I also wonder if she doesn't like the dress and wants something different.", "\u201cOmg!! Life saver. That is honestly such a relief, thank you ugh \ud83d\ude23 \u201c\n\nHow hard would it have been to text that instead of blowing up and threatening a friends big day. Clearly you wanted her there seeing as you\u2026 bought the dress. NTA.", "Dear world: buy the size you are and have it altered a month to two weeks before the wedding. It goes in better than it goes out.", "NTA \n\nI got pregnant post buying a bridesmaid dress, but I had already bought a size (almost 2) bigger than I needed. \n\nIt\u2019s much nicer to have a dress tailored to you. It\u2019s much more flattering!", "I\u2019m kinda embarrassed to say that I\u2019ve seen waaaaay too many reality shows about wedding dresses to think buying a smaller size is ever a good idea. I -did- need a bridesmaid\u2019s dress taken in a bit, but that was way better than needing a whole new dress at the last minute!", "I had the opposite problem.  I had an ED from 24 into my 30\u2019s.  My fitting for my dress was a week before the wedding.  When I got dressed day of I had lost enough weight (not intentionally, just nerves I guess).  I had to gather the dress up behind my bouquet because it was loose enough I was tripping over it."]}
