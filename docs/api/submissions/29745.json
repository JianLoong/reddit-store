We've been friends for a long time, see each other almost every other week, and generally get a long super well and have never fought until now. \n\nSince high school, she's always been a yo-yo dieter and will cycle through gaining weight and losing weight.

She said that my wedding was going to be a great motivator to lose weight. \n\nThree sizes was quite aggressive in my opinion, as it would put her in a weight that she hasn't been in since college. I didn't say anything though as I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. After a couple of months of seeing no progress though, I quietly bought her the same exact dress in a larger size. \n\nCome this past week, she called me in tears saying that she didn't think that she could fit into her bridesmaid dress and felt horrible for ruining the dress code.

She said that my doubt was offensive and that I must have been planning for this to happen. I told her that I just cared about her, and obviously wouldn't have mentioned the dress if she had lost the weight. But she herself brought up that she couldn't fit in her current dress, so I wasn't sure what she's mad about. \n\nShe's now threatening to drop out of the wedding party, and some of our mutual friends think I was kind of an AH for not being supportive enough.

To find a different bridesmaid?\n\nFrankly I think she was being a bad friend from how she behaved. Playing fast and loose with your wedding isn't okay.", "NTA you buying the dress just in case she didn\u2019t lose the weight shows how much you support her and want her to be in your wedding. She was ridiculous to buy a dress several sizes smaller\u2026what was she thinking?!", "NTA  i just honestly don't know what to say except insecure people can't take even the most mild dent to their self esteem.", "NTA.\n\nYou cared enough to offer a free safety net and she\u2019s mad she needs it?\n\nThat\u2019s a her issue. She needs to evaluate her own defensive response and stop misplacing her shame of failure on you.*\n\n\n* In my opinion she feels this way. In reality, bodies change and there\u2019s an ebb and flow to life.", "NTA! My maid of honor did the same thing. Only it was one size smaller and guess what? She couldn't fit into it - so off to fabric land we went to find some fabric close enough to compliment the dress and my seamstress turned her dress into a lace up corset back. \nI'm about to be a matron of honour for a friend and I will be buying the size I wear now. If I lose weight great but it's too important of a day to risk letting my friend down over sometime trivial as a dress size.", "NTA. These are her issues to deal with; you were simply covering your own ass.", "NTA. You did a very kind thing for your friend, but really she should have bought the larger dress herself. If she had lost the weight altering a dress to make it smaller is fine, altering one to make it larger a lot harder (if not impossible). As far as I can see you've saved the day, her behaving all butt hurt because you were a realist is ridiculous", "NTA. Good intentions, but all she took it as \"Not only are you fat, I seriously doubted you'd even try to lose weight\"", "NTA. So long as you didn't make any comments or criticism to go with it, buying a backup was a kind thing to do. You spent part of your wedding budget to make sure your friend wouldn't be left out in the cold. It sucks that she wasn't able to achieve her goal in time, but it's not the end of the world. She's frustrated, and it's understandable she would have big feelings about the situation, but it was still extremely generous to buy a dress you weren't even sure would be used. You had no way of knowing it would be needed, and you made sure she still got to wear the dress that made her happy. So long as you were kind about it, there's no issue with you doing your best to make her still feel special and noticed on your day. You sound like a sweet friend.", "NTA  \nYou were very supportive. Many other brides would have told her to get the larger size and then alter it when she lost weight to avoid dress drama. But you supported her enough to let her do it her way.Not your fault you could see the situation for what it was and prepared accordingly. Probably one of the most rational brides I've seen in this sub for a while.", "NTA. I was a maid of honor and was going to get a dress 1 size smaller. My BFF convinced me to get the current size in case something came up. I lost the weight but on the day of the wedding I tried to unzip the dress only to find out that the zipper was broken. I was PANICKING. It didn\u2019t even occur to my dumbass to try on the dress before the wedding. Thankfully bc I lost weight I was able to get into the dress without unzipping it, I was so lucky! Trying to lose 3 dress sizes before the wedding is insane.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Imagine if you didn\u2019t buy her the dress? She wouldn\u2019t have anything.", "ESH.....I would have told her in no uncertain terms, her hopes of weight loss or otherwise cannot be a variable when planning one the biggest occasions of your life!!\nIf she said she had hopes to conceive by then...would she have purchased a maternity dress??!!\nIt's unreasonable: personally I would have explained this.\nI so get why you respectfully did what you did and believe you wouldn't have mentioned it if her plan was successful however I think everyone could have handled this better.\nI'm not sure I'd be willing to continue with her in the party seeing as she now feels you're an awful friend for prioritising your wedding over her weight loss and should maybe keep in mind if you didn't get an alternative, she wouldn't even have the option!\nYou don't need this stress what if she pulls this stunt on the day? I'd have concerns.", "NTA. She\u2019s angry with herself for setting an unrealistic goal and instead of appreciating you having a backup plan because \u2026unrealistic goals crash hard and you wanted her in the wedding no matter what. I really hope she can get past her weight-loss disappointment before the wedding and be able to appreciate your generous thoughtfulness. She should be honored to have a solid 24k friend while gold plated brass bridezillas are dictating hair color and weight changes and insisting groomsman shave off full fledged beards.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't say anything to disparage her, even though *she* made the decision to buy a dress 3 sizes too small. You didn't hound her about her progress. You allowed her to follow her own path without comment. \n\nWhat you did was kindly cover your friend and insured she'd be able to be a part of your big day. You wanted her there that badly because she's important to you. \n\nHer frustration/upset for not getting down to the size *she* wanted (you didn't even ask her to lose weight) is understandable, but lashing out at you is uncalled for.", "NTA, she didn't have realistic expectations for herself. It sounds like you supported her plan, but had a more realistic outcome in mind but didn't want to hurt her feelings. I don't think anything would have been 'right' in this situation according to her.", "NTA. You had a backup plan and practically by definition it's not what you wanted to happen. \n\nYou shouldn't be taking any of the BS that she's dropping out of the wedding party because you're a big meanie that bought a dress that fit her. She dropped out when she called you saying she couldn't wear a matching dress with the rest of the wedding party. Your friends can suck it too. Do they think a bridesmaid should be able to wear whatever she wants? \n\nYou got something that ensured she would be included either way and you're getting crapped on for it. Boo on all of them.", "NTA.\nYou did something generous that you didn\u2019t tell her about, and clearly didn\u2019t plan to unless it was to solve a problem she set up for herself. In my opinion that is support way beyond the standard, not less. You let your friend try her way (that you were clearly rightly concerned about), but made arrangements to have her back if it didn\u2019t work out. If she wants to drop out of the party, at this point I\u2019d call that one less problem to worry about. You sound like a great friend. Back yourself.", "NTA. You tried.", "NTA as you were making an effort to ensure she could attend the wedding. However delivery of the message is critical here and depending on how you told her that you had the dress would dramatically impact the outcome. \n\nIt sounds like she has her own internal issues going on and I\u2019d let her know that you did what you did because you care for her and wanted to make sure there was a plan b because you want her there. That being said if she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable then there\u2019s not pressure to attend.", "NTA. Some people cannot stand kindness.", "NTA - she was the one being inconsiderate by using your wedding as some kind of test to lose weight.  She didn't have any back up plan herself, meaning she was fine with causing you, the bride, additional stress and worry if her plan didn't work out.  \n\nAnd while she's allowed to be embarrassed that she failed at reaching her goal, she should otherwise be nothing but grateful to you because your prudent thinking means she can still participate in your wedding without this hiccup causing any more problems.  Instead she's turning this into an even bigger drama, with her centered as the main character.  Is she usually a drama queen and attention-hog?", "They apparently expected you to compromise your vision of what your wedding would be to accommodate a friend's unrealistic expectations.  Kind of an asshole move.  \n\nYou didn't deride your friend.  You didn't sabotage her.  You didn't discourage her.  You did what you needed to do to ensure your wedding would go off without a hitch.  Had she met her goal, she never would have known the difference.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA\nYou did everything right, she is just angry because she is embarrassed and that is on her not you. \ud83d\ude05", ">When she heard this, she blew up and accused me of being a bad friend for never believing in her. \n\nIts just speculation but maybe she wants to wear a different dress? There are people who want to become the sensation of the wedding and outshine the bride.\n\nBecause its naive (in my opinion) to buy a dress THREE SIZES smaller! Especially when you OP mentioned, that you saw not any improvement.\n\nI think it was very nice for you to buy the same dress, that would fit her in cause she could not fit in the dress she bought. NTA.", "Oh god, she\u2019s going to make your entire wedding day about HER if that was her reaction. What\u2019s the point of her even calling you, the bride, to stress you out about something that is not your fault and you cannot change? How selfish of her. Better to drop her period. NTA", "You sound like a really good planner, the kind of person I'd want to work for my company. Your bridesmaid was all up in her feels about her weight already when she spoke to you. Rather than seeing you as part of the solution, she decided to vomit her feelings on you and make it somehow your fault. That's a real character flaw of hers. I hope she gets her act together and apologizes quickly.\n\n If not, maybe you don't need her kind of drama in your wedding party. She set herself up to fail, and when she failed, she blamed how . . . how many other things that bridesmaids do could have that kind of drama attached--bachelorette party? Wedding rehearsal? Hair and Makeup? She might be a drama queen for days.", "NTA. She was clearly being far too ambitious with her plans and you have saved her bacon. It\u2019s embarrassing for her and she\u2019s lashing out because of it", "I think it was lovely of OP to quietly purchase the back up dress AND not seek reimbursement when plan B was actually needed!!! \n\nThe true path to Wedding happiness is knowing that plans will go astray, but having back up plans so you can roll with the punches. \n\nI agree with the poster I\u2019m replying to\u2026 Give your friend space. If she\u2019s determined to be upset that you were prepared with a back up dress, that\u2019s her choice. If she no longer wants to be in the wedding, also her choice.

May you have a relaxed and wonderful Wedding day!!! \n\nNTA", "I bought goal jeans, mostly because they were on clearance and \"only\" 2 sizes smaller than my size at the time.

I would NEVER take that risk with a bridesmaid's dress!", "Theres no way op sucks.", "agree with these ppl just wanted to say my opinion about her reaction \n\nIf she was really trying to find the dress, mad at herself for making a mistake, she would have been relieved that you had a backup.  Instead, she was angry. This tells me that she was hoping for a different resolution like \"Ok you can wear something different\" maybe she thinks the dress you picked only looks good on skinny girls \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if it were me I would not reach out to her at all until she apologizes.", "I got clothes from 14 years ago. I keep them because i loves them but got fatter \ud83d\ude02 still have them under my bed for if a miracle ever happens", "It doesn\u2019t even make sense to get a goal outfit in general. I hit my goal weight and, well, turns out I have wide hip bones. The jeans weren\u2019t ever going to fit. \n\nWith a dress? Oh man that\u2019s worse \n\nMeet the goal then get the outfit. The friend should have got one that fit in the first place and have it took in if she lost weight.", "Same - except they do fit now. Snug, but they fit.
