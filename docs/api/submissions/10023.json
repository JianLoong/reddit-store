It's manipulative to expect us to believe you took off work for tasks like this. \n\nI suspect you wanted time to yourself (because your spouse would have made plans or given you tasks, had you told her you were off) and are too immature to be honest about it, so you manipulate the situation by going all in on a tenuous pretense of it being to work on something nice for her. \n\nI suspect your immaturity and passive-aggressive, subversive nature has contributed to a lack of trust, which has created a Parent- child dynamic in your relationship.
