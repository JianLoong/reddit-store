For you and your wife, using vacation days in this way would be an issue. It wouldn't be for me and I'm sure my partner wouldn't care either. Hell if my partner took a couple days off to clean up and thus freed my weekend/evenings so that I don't have to do it in my down time I would be ecstatic. Your priorities are not the same as everyone else's. \n\nAnd either way, the issue the fiance seems to have is that she wasn't told he would be off work, not that he even took work off in the first place. I suspect there's probably some major trust issues on her part, especially with the added info that she doesn't want him watching porn.", "You don\u2019t know their work hours at all. I\u2019d assume that after going through all that effort for her, if he didn\u2019t have vacation days to spare he would have saved them. Of course, this is a baseless extrapolation, which is what you\u2019re doing. \n\nNTA, op. Weird she didn\u2019t notice earlier, but equally weird that she\u2019s so mad. Also the phone thing is still iffy post edit\u2026", "In America, you aren't guaranteed even a single PTO day.", "I mean I guess.  You literally just go into sign-in options and change it to not need a password. Super easy.", "Yes, but generally partners (particularly with limited time off) plan vacation days together. Also if the reason they're giving for taking the time off is valentine's day and they did not disclose that they took time off at some point of time during the big reveal, it would seem suspicious. Nothing wrong with taking time off if you need it, but not communicating is silly at best, shady at worst.", "The issue isn t that he took days at his own discretion.\n\nIt's that he lied to her for two days, saying that he was working while he wasn't, and then his explanation makes no sense to his wife as the house didn't looks extra clean, nor was there apparently any indication of a large amount of effort gone into valentine's day \n\nHad the house been deep cleaned, and his valentine's day evening been as special as he's claiming, then I'm sure his wife wouldn't be upset. \n\nBut as it stands he took time off, lied about it, and when caught claims it was to deep clean/cook/buy a gift ..... But there's no evidence to indicate he spent any amount of time at all on those things. \n\nSo it sounds like just another lie.", "Where do you live..?\n\nBecause in America people get very little vacation days. Like.. 5 per year typically. And yes, using the very little amount of vacation you get without discussing it with your partner, who may want to do something together, or visit family, is selfish, and an asshole move.\n\nIf OP has a small limited amount of PTO, and he just used it to \u201cclean\u201d for *two days*, then yea, asshole.", "I have never used all my PTO days. Plus most Aussie companies will let you go into negative balance. \n\nNo one is ever TA for taking days off to do things in a normal healthy country. We are expected to have lives outside of work", "In most other civilised countries we get mental health days, time in lieu days and all sorts of days. \n\nYou guys should fight for better working conditions", "This is assuming everyone can afford to take trips and that everyone finds that the most valuable use of their PTO. I take random ass days off all the time just to get a break and my partner has no issue with. Hell I took a whole week and a half off in the second half of last year and just lounged around at home the whole time because I needed that for myself and he was more than happy for me to do so.\n\nIf you have agreed with your partner that days off are to be saved for vacation that's fine. But it's asinine to say that's the only way it can/should be done by everyone else.", "The person I was responding to said it was strange not to be able to take time off without discussing with your partner.\n\nI was explaining why it wasn't necessarily strange, not making a statement about how anyone else should spend their pto."]}
