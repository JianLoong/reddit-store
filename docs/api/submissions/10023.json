I cleaned up, groomed the dog, got all caught up on laundry, went shopping for gifts, prepared a menu for V-Day Dinner and purchased the groceries and cooked. \n\nShe went through my phone this morning and saw texts to a friend that I had the day off and was furious that I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I was going to tell her today and the lie was not malignant, but just meant to help get everything done and made to make it so she wasn\u2019t expecting anything.

He has a cellphone since 1998 and I'd never dream of checking his phone without his permission. In an emergency, when mine's not working etc., I would only use the function necessary, not taking the opportunity to check his messages. To this day, when I ask him to give me something out of my handbag, he gives me the whole bag and doesn't reach into it to rummage about.\n\nAside from the main issue and your wife's ridiculous reaction to your kindness, she needs to respect some boundries in the relationship. NTA.", "NTA - Sorry, I think your finacee is an AH. For everything you've described about her.", "NTA sounds like she may have trust issues, I can't imagine why she would care that you didn't tell her especially if it was set up a surprise for her.\n\nI wonder if you asked her if she would tell you more specifically why she was upset about this so you can set ground rules for future events.", "NTA, but why is she getting angry with you, after going through your phone?  Sounds like some huge trust issues going on.", "INFO why is she going through your phone?", "Unless you're missing key info \n\nNTA", "Sounds like your wife has guilty conscience op", "NTA\nShe is for going through your phone. That's super toxic. \nShe's gonna feel real dumb when she finds out why you did it.", "Info- you took two days off to clean the house and cook. Did she not see any evidence of housework or food prep after the first day off?\n\nThis is where your story might sound a bit suspicious. You say you took time off work to get ready for Valentine's day....two full days. That's a lot of time. And if she sees nothing indicate you were putting in 16 hours worth of effort, then it begs the question \"what was he really doing?\"\n\nTwo days worth of cooking and cleaning should be clearly obvious the instant she walks in the door.", "Dude...going through your phone? NOPE.", "She wants to go through your phone because you looked at porn once ...... Are you 12", "NTA unless you were doing something shady, which you were not. \n\nI stopped telling my husband about all my planned days off because he would plan chores or things for me to do on my days off \"since I don't have anything to do.\" I hope she can learn to be more understanding in the future. Sometimes, you just want a \"me day\" or mental health day. More people should do this. Maybe there would be fewer angry people in the world.", "Sounds like she has some trust issues with you. Sounds like your intentions were good. Apparently, she sees them as deceitful.... so I\u2019m guessing something else is going on here. \n\nAlso, how did she not notice the house was clean & laundry was done?

No trust no relationship. Leave her before it's too late", "YTA for referring to your fiancee as \"the wife\". And yes, YTA for not telling her you were staying home from work.

I think most people are aware that lying is sometimes necessary in the short-term when it's to prepare for an upcoming surprise, and that it's not a sign that the person is untrustworthy or hiding anything aside from the surprise in question. Seems like she overreacted.", "Seems like there have been some lies in her or your past and she views withholding info as a lie. Or she may have control issues.\n\nI\u2019d say NTA here but you all need to sit down and talk about why she has such a strong reaction and whether or not she wants surprises.  Maybe she had surprise future plans for those two days.  TBH 2 days seems excessive", "I responded to that question in another comment.", "my partner has told me his unlock code, we've been together *years* but every time he's thrown me his phone to use because I can't find mine or I'm looking something up for him while he's on anothe call or something, I have to ask him for it because it wouldn't even occur to me to remember the code because it's not somethign I have any desire to go through.  \n\nsame with his email passwords.  I have them, just in case he wants/needs something and he's busy/away/can't get in for some reason and is asking me to try, but I couldn't tell you tehm with a gun to my head.  he gives me the code because he trusts me that I trust him.  same as he has my codes but has never used them.", "Agree! My husband & I (31 yrs married) leave our phones laying about everywhere in our house. My phone doesn\u2019t have a pw & I know his but we don\u2019t ever look through each other\u2019s phones. We have no reason to. Even if I needed his phone for something I would use it for that & give it back to him. \n\nHe does the same thing with my bag... drives me nuts. Just reach in & grab it! Nothing in there bites! \n\nI\u2019m guessing there are very serious trust issues here if wife believes OP\u2019s intentions were deceitful.", "Yeah I did try this morning, but she was getting ready for work so the conversation could only go so deep. She just kept hammering home the fact that it was a lie. I\u2019ll try to have a more meaningful conversation later today with her.", "So kind of embarrassing but I looked at porn awhile back and she found out. I told her she can look through my phone in the future if she ever had doubts, since I agreed not to watch it anymore.

Genuinely curious.", "Well I also went out shopping for her, ordered a bouquet to be delivered to her job, bought flowers for home, etc. I definitely do need to clarify though, that I work from home, although it\u2019s a busy call center job where I can\u2019t step away from my computer outside of my 15 minute breaks, of which I get two and my hour lunch. I usually try to straighten up a little but I wanted to spend my time off going a bit deeper into the cleaning and house work. I guess she just assumed I was doing these things in-between work time.", "Because I\u2019m slow by nature and couldn\u2019t decide on a menu, and had trouble with gifts.", "I was trying to make a title that was a bit easier to read. I can update it, was not meant to offend or come off a type of way. But I don\u2019t know if I agree with you on this one, only because you\u2019re saying to lie just in a different way.

I appreciate your opinion though, and taking the time to respond.", ">You could have faked a migraine or other illness\n\nBut that would still have been lying to her...", "Oh yes, exactly. Every time he wants me to do something on his laptop, he's annoyed that I can't remember his password.

Personally I don't see how its a lie, thats just how surprises work. Id wager this had to do with some violated trust in her past and unless it was you, its unfair of her to take it out on you. Good luck with that.", "Real talk...this doesn't sound like a fun relationship. She's acting more like your keeper than your partner!", "Yikes. Might want to reconsider this marriage dude.", "You're painting a picture of a very controlling person who treats you like a doormat.", "unless the porn was of seriously questionable nature...that's a bit of a yikes.  she won't let you wawtch porn, will go through your phone, explodes about a surprise...y'all need to TALK and talk BEFORE any wedding happens.", "Is she super religious?", "Umm....since when is watching porn a problem?", "Guilty people often try to find guilt in their partners. He's talking about cheating... But remember it's reddit and don't take seriously every redditors word without your own suspicion.", "That's pretty much your problem, right there \n\nIf the cleaning job done on the house appears, to the other person who lives there, that it was just the normal level of clean and she feels that it could have been achieved in two 15 minute breaks and lunch when working...... It's going to be a hard sell to convince them that you needed to take two full days off work to achieve it. \n\nOrder flowers for delivery is a 5-10 minute task, and bring flowers home/shopping also doesn't take two  days worth of time.\n\nShe's upset because from her point of view, you are lying. She caught you lying about being at work, and to her, your explanation sounds more like a quickly thought up excuse/lie.\n\nI'm certainly not saying that you are lying....I obviously have no idea. I'm just trying to explain her possible thought process. \n\nI'm sure her mind right now is wondering what you were really doing, or who you were really out with for two days leading up to Valentine's day.", "Thank you very much.", "Seriously. Run, Forest, run.", "No she is not, not anymore. Grew up in church but has mostly drifted away from that life.", "Ohhh ok I understand now. Yeah I\u2019m not worried about that at all. Thanks for the clarification though.", "Sounds like she kept part of that life.", "depends on why she doesn't like porn - some people don't like it because of a degredation aspect and just in the 20 years or so of my own sex life porn has gotten a LOT more violent towards women and I mean a lot, even very 'vanilla' porn can be wildly degrading and violent..  \n\nothers just disagree with porn in a more general  \"it can be hugely damaging to the mental and physical wellbeing of the male and female performers\" way, and they don't want to support it.\n\nor she might be someone that thinks watching porn is \"cheating\".  couldn't be me, but some think that way.  \n\nor, as you suggest, her church upbringing left her feeling a kind of way about sex and porn.\n\nbut OP needs to talk to her and get to the bottom of that minefield because that's some control right there and it's concerning.  that she doesn't trust him enough to take him at his word and instead goes through his phone - and not just history or videos, but MESSAGES....thats concerning.  you ain't looking for porn in messages"]}
