It's manipulative to expect us to believe you took off work for tasks like this. \n\nI suspect you wanted time to yourself (because your spouse would have made plans or given you tasks, had you told her you were off) and are too immature to be honest about it, so you manipulate the situation by going all in on a tenuous pretense of it being to work on something nice for her. \n\nI suspect your immaturity and passive-aggressive, subversive nature has contributed to a lack of trust, which has created a Parent- child dynamic in your relationship.

That's not \"planning and preparing\", that's \"2 days fucking around and goofing off\" IMO.", "The issues is communication and how a partner would react finding out you took time off. There are so many sitcoms and shows that show how this behavior ends in. Even if there was no malicious reason  to it. It's about the \"what if\" and \"unknown\", if they find out they are like \"Well he's taking time off without telling me either A he wants time away from (their mind could wonder all over the place for reasons) or they could be trying to meet someone in secret. \n\nSo many people are hating your partner when really it's about your partner thinking it's suspicious you took time off and didn't tell her. \n\nLet us know an Update. Your partner is not terrible for thinking this is strange of you.", "You BOTH need to work on communication - not just you. Clearly she has issues as well.", "I mean this in the nicest way possible- she needs therapy", "Okay. \n\nSo the issue is that she simply does not trust you. \n\nThis is either because you have betrayed her often in the past by lying, OR because others have lied to her in the past and she is punishing you for it. \n\nSo, either you have not regained her trust and therapy is needed, OR you are trustworthy and she is blaming you for actions of others in the past, and therapy is needed (for her). \n\nIf neither of you are getting therapy, there is really nothing Reddit can do to help. If you stay in a relationship that isn't founded on trust, then what? You can buy all the Valentine's Day gifts you want, and they will just appear to be cover-ups for guilt for what you were \"really doing\" on those \"days off\", instead of loving and thoughtful gestures. \n\nIn the meantime, my husband can get me a card for Valentine's Day and that's all he needs to do because we have decades of love and trust built up and he pampers me with everything I want all the time anyway.", "Doesn't sound like a healthy one either.", "That's what I've been asking myself too. Sure, some social media platforms also have some hidden porn, but WhatsApp for example? And even if OP watched more than vanilla porn, that shouldn't be an issue, as long as it's legal in his country. Of course, some stuff still has debatable aspects even if it is legal(thinking of bodily fluids and stuff), but having some fantasies isn't necessarily unhealthy?", "Believe it or not, some people don't like it. Shocking, I know.", "I put my password on my laptop with a labelmaker so he could it, since it's the one we watch shows on and keep connected to the TV monitor. It gets used for other stuff sometimes because that puts it in a very accessible location.\n\nNow I just wish he would stop using Google and YouTube in my browser because it changes the algorithm for what I get recommended on my phone... definitely no issues with *actually* important or private stuff getting looked through.", "I'm sorry. That's a major breach of trust.", "> She caught you lying about being at work,\n\n\nBut OP works from home.... I think there's more to this story honestly.", "It most definitely is. If you can\u2019t trust someone to tell you the truth in a relationship then you have a problem. But I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve never had a girlfriend judging from your username you\u2019re just an AH :) sorry not sorry", "It's hard to let go of the ingrained behaviors, but she needs to work on it.\n\nIt took me something like ten years, even though I trusted my husband and know that he loves me. It still makes me unhappy, but that's a me-problem so I keep it to myself.\n\nNTA. What exactly would have changed had she known about your Master Plan? Nothing.  It was your day that you took off for the benefit of both of you.", "Personally not a fan but I don't mind if my partner watches.", "There is definitely something more to this story \n\nWorking from home or the office, if you are working, then that's where your time is spent.\n\n So if the morning after valentines day I randomly discover that my husband hadn't gone in to work at all that week, and I ask him why not and why he had been pretending for two days that he was working all day.... And his answer was \"well I needed time to put together your big valentine's day surprise!\" And I looked around and the house looked the same, and dinner the night before was a regular dinner for a week night, and other than flowers and a last-minute gift it was a regular Tuesday night..... I'd be suspicious as well. Because..... What surprise???\n\nI'd have no problem with him taking time off to recharge or relax ... But it's weird that he's claiming it to be some huge sacrifice to do something FOR ME, when theres literally nothing to indicate he put any additional effort into anything. I'd wonder what he was hiding.", "What? It\u2019s got nothing to do with telling the truth, there\u2019s no lie involved not telling them you took a vacation day?\n\nSeems like you\u2019re the one who has problems, sincerely. You\u2019re doing a lot of projecting at the end there.", "sounds like OPs wife does mind though, which is the only thing that matters", "Yeah especially because she seems like a control freak.", "If you say so. OP doesn't care she goes through the phone so I'm not judging her for that."]}
