I am a software engineer but work with some very custom hardware chips in my day to day. \n\nMy team needed to integrate a new micro controller into a product we are designing and since I am the lead for the software that will interact with this component my manager set up a meeting for me with the electrical engineer in charge of designing that component who is on a different team.\n\nI have worked with various such other teams in the past but this component was one that is considered quite specialized. When my manager and I talked about it, he did not refer much to the engineer I would be meeting and refereed to the team and used the they/them pronoun. I refereed to the designer as he many times and my manager did not correct me. The name was also very gender neutral.\n\nWhen I went to the meeting room, there was a younger woman in the room probably in her mid to late 20s. None of the electrical engineers I have met before at my company have been women and in general the few women engineers we have all work on things like web and front end interface development. Since my manager had not corrected me when I said he/him, I assumed this person was some kind of product manager on their team or something. She was also very dressed up, in a skirt, heels and makeup which is an attire product managers and HR people typically have. I also would have expected someone in this position to be much older.\n\nSo, I told her, Ill be right back and make coffee while we wait for the engineer to arrive and to message me on slack if he arrives. When I got back, I said something like \"he hasn't arrived yet\".\n\nShe then finally mentioned she was the engineer and angrily stormed out. I sent an apology email to her but she has not responded yet but an HR representative has added a meeting to my work calendar and I can see that she has a meeting at the same time on hers.\n\nAITA here? I feel embarrassed and I did not mean to assume she was not the engineer, had my manager told me, or had she had a feminine name or profile picture I would have not done so. I looked up her profile and she really is the most qualified person to work with me on this even though she is really young.", "created_utc": 1690581041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15caavo/aita_for_not_realizing_my_female_coworker_is_an/", "score": 4160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m X, nice to meet you.\u201d She would have responded with her gender neutral name and, voila! You could have avoided all of this.\n\nYTA. You made a ton of assumptions (rooted in misogynistic views whether intentional or not) and weren\u2019t even polite enough to introduce yourself to a colleague.

I hope you learn something from this experience.", "Enter room you have a meeting with someone \n\n\u201cHi I\u2019m name\u201d\n\n\u201cHi I\u2019m gender neutral name\u201d \n\n\u201cGreat how are u? shall we get started\u201d\n\nInstead u blame your boss for not correcting you\nYou blame the industry for never having worked with a female\nYou blame her for being all dressed up, makeup, wearing a skirt\n\nInstead blame yourself for assuming it\u2019s a guy, assuming a woman who wears makeup can\u2019t be electrical engineer *spoiler, they can! They can also do other jobs while wearing makeup and skirts not just HR jobs!!! \n\nHR is going to have a field day with you!", "YTA. 10 seconds to prevent these misunderstandings. \n\n\"Hi, I'm ________. I work in __________.\"", "YTA, all it would of taken was you sticking your hand out for a hand shake, and saying. \"Hey, I'm OP, and you are?\"\n\nEdit: corrected word", "I mean, you could have simply introduced yourself to her and waited until she introduced herself. YTA here, yes.", "YTA. So you walked into a meeting where one person was present and didn\u2019t even introduce yourself?

You were the one responsible for figuring out who you were going to meet, not your manager. If you didn\u2019t, the very least you could have done was introduce yourself to the person that was in the meeting room. This was terribly misogynistic and disrespectful.\n\nApologize and take seriously the bias training, assuming they don\u2019t fire you.\n\nAnother advice: learn from your manager and get used to they/them when referring to people. This is standard practice in most tech companies I\u2019ve been, helps people avoid making assumptions about gender (e.g. when reading interview feedback).", "YTA. All you had to do was introduce yourself, and they would\u2019ve also introduced themselves, thus revealing they were in fact the person you were meeting. \n\nI am also a female engineer with a gender neutral name.

The professional, polite thing to do would have been to say \"hi, I'm OP, are you X?\" Instead, you saw a woman, judged her on her appearance, and didn't even bother to ask if she was the engineer, just wandered off to make coffee.", "YTA. All you had to do was introduce yourself, you know, basic manners.", "YTA. It sucks that women still have to do everything and then some for people to treat them equally in male-dominated fields, such as engineering. You should have asked first instead of assumed, and on top of it, your manager should have definitely corrected you and not used they/them (unless she actually does go by they).", ">So, I told her, Ill be right back and make coffee while we wait for the engineer to arrive and to message me on slack if he arrives. When I got back, I said something like \"he hasn't arrived yet\".\n\nWait, did you just assume she was a receptionist or something and order her around?  You didn't know her, yet you told her to message you when the engineer arrived?  And am I reading this right, you told her to make coffee, or did you go make coffee?", "yeah dude you know YTA or you wouldn't be feeling embarrassed about this. I don't think you consciously think 'women can't be engineers' but you clearly do have some biases about what an engineer looks like that you probably want to try and untangle.\n\nin the conversation with HR try and be honest, non defensive, and listen. she's probably had men her whole career assume she's not the engineer because of her being a woman, especially a feminine and young woman.", "YTA\u2026 you were told to MEET a person in a MEETING room, you arrived at that MEETING room, saw a person and what? Your brain short circuited upon learning that person was a female?  Another question: why did you assume this random woman in a meeting room would know who in pluperfect hell you were or how to message you if an acceptable male engineer was to appear?", "YTA. For these parts specifically:\n\n> The name was also very gender neutral.\n\nSo you naturally assumed it was a man?\n\n> She was also very dressed up, in a skirt, heels and makeup which is an attire product managers and HR people typically have.\n\nReally weird of you to just assume someone's job since they were dressed nicely. Engineers can't wear heels and makeup?\n\n> I also would have expected someone in this position to be much older.\n\nI can connect the dots as to why you thought this but it was rude and ageist to assume this.\n\n> So, I told her, Ill be right back and make coffee while we wait for the engineer to arrive and to message me on slack if he arrives.\n\nWhy didn't you just ask her who she was? It's rude enough that you made the assumption she wasn't the engineer, but why didn't you just introduce yourself? \"Hi, I'm /u/engineermistake\" would have allowed her to introduce herself and you could have figured out who you were talking to.\n\n> or had she had a feminine name or profile picture I would have not done so\n\nAgain, just weird stuff going on here.\n\nNot much to be done but accept that you made a mistake, don't try to talk your way out of it, and try to do better next time.", "YTA you entered a meeting and left bc the person there \u201ccouldnt be an engineer\u201d and then list all these excuses and attributes that dont fucking matter or define them as a person or their capabilities and are pretending its ok.

No one should have to tell you that the coworker is female! You were told that the person you were meeting with was the engineer, you decided, OH this well dressed lady couldnt be one because \" insert outdated ideas\"", "YTA and as a woman in tech myself, I kind of hope you get crucified in this HR meeting.", "YTA. Imagine if you didn't say anything, and just waited around for her, not knowing she was there already. Did you even ask what they were doing there?\n\nNot even a 'Hi, I haven't seen you around here before, can I help you?' You just automatically just made a coffee and stood around waiting.", "\"Even though she is really young\"... I wonder if you'd even be thinking that if she were a man in his late 20s. \n\nI find it extra grating you assumed her role based on her attire. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Rather than judging your coworker by her gender and her attire, you should have introduced yourself and asked if she was the engineer you had been scheduled to meet. This entire post is full of assumptions. From your description, this woman seems to be dressed formally and professionally for a work meeting. Women do not owe you a certain look in order to gain your respect.\n\nGood on your HR department for scheduling a meeting, because your behavior is unacceptable. At least you admitted at the end that she was, in fact, the most qualified person for the job.", "YTA - ignoring the sexist stereotypes. You walked into a meeting room and saw a younger employee, did you say hello & introduce yourself and exchange names & job titles? no. For whatever reason their name wasn't necessary for you to learn & your time was more valued than theirs, why should they sit around and message you when other meeting attendant shows up?", "YTA. You are a professional for God's sake, you are supposed to confirm someone's identity when you meet them for the very first time in a professional setting.", "Lol, YTA but I think you're more of an idiot than an ass. Was saying \"hey, are you X?\" really that hard? This is a really stupid mistake to make.", "YTA for assuming something incorrectly and for dismissing her.  If you had bothered to introduce yourself to her then she would have had the opportunity to introduce herself to you and you would have gotten her name and known who she was.  You just saw a nicely dressed female and dismissed her, exited the room and then when you returned again made an incorrect assumption.   Even if she was a product manager or HR the proper thing to do would have been to say hello and introduce yourself.", "YTA, nothing irritates me more than guys who think i know nothing just because I\u2019m female.", "Yeah you\u2019ve fucked up here. Why didn\u2019t you just ask who she was? Do you routinely not introduce yourself to people you don\u2019t know in a working setting? Not only is this deeply misogynistic and ageist but it\u2019s also just rude. YTA.", "YTA, majorly so. I am a male engineer, you don\u2019t make that type of assumption. There are a growing number of women in engineering and sexist assumptions that women aren\u2019t engineers are incredibly harmful and ridiculous. Just because they don\u2019t refer to them as an engineer doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t.\n\nMy company employs a lot of engineers and not everyones title is \u201cengineer\u201d. Heck, mine isn\u2019t and I am a degreed engineer and have been working for a number of years. Your assumption based on how she was dressed is sexist as well, to be blunt. ~~Telling a woman to make you coffee, regardless of her job, is completely out of line (even in a coffee shop, they know how to do their job).~~\n\nEDIT: I do apologize, I misunderstood your section on the coffee. I thought you were saying you told her to make you coffee. I was wrong to make that assumption.", "YTA. \n\nYou make judgements on peoples qualifications and abilities based on gender, appearance, and age, and then dismiss them and expect them to act like your secretary(\"I'll be back, message me when they get here\") when they aren't whatever it was you were expecting. \n\nSuper YTA. This is 2023. You should be embarrassed.", "You couldn't introduce yourself and ask for their name?\n\nYTA", "YTA- on top of not introducing yourself because you assumed the other person couldn't be the engineer you then double down with i looked her up and she is the most qualified *even though she's young!* \nYou are way overdue for a very long meeting with HR.", "She's probably tired of people like you. YTA.", "YTA for trying to put blame on your manager, or her name and lack of profile picture.\n\nBut also incredibly dumb.  Your manager set up the meeting with the engineer, consider the leaps you made to assume she wasn't.  You could having introduced yourself and not put yourself in this situation.", "It\u2019s too bad good manners (or hell - even curiosity!) couldn\u2019t be used to simply introduce yourself and ask her who she was. Even if her name is gender neutral, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to default to assuming the engineer was a man. You could have looked up who the person was ahead of time, if only to get a better idea of what they bring to the table. \n\nYTA but you seem contrite. Apologize, without qualification or justification.", "You didn\u2019t just assume she WASN\u2019T a qualified engineer there to meet with you, you didn\u2019t even think she was worth introducing yourself to, or asking her name, or any hello at all. That is where the sexism lies and makes all your other ifs and buts about your manager completely moot. YTA. Acknowledge it, own it, apologise.", "QUESTION: You walk in & see a woman at the table. You don\u2019t know this person. Is there a compelling reason that you barked an order at her instead of introducing yourself? Did you completely dismiss her as unimportant and, in fact, there to do your bidding because she was wearing makeup? \n\nIn what context do you typically introduce yourself to people who are in the room where you\u2019re about to have a meeting?\n\nAre you always so rude, or are you only rude to young women who take too much care with their appearance to possibly be important to your job?", "YTA and you need to go into the HR meeting knowing that and with a clear plan on how to rectify it. I believe that this was not a malicious act of gender discrimination on your part, just some internalized sexist ideas. The fact that it was not malicious or intentional means nothing, you still made a very qualified and professional woman feel disregarded, and I can promise you that you are not the first person to do so. I guarantee that as a younger woman in a male dominated field she has had to put up with a lot of sexism, the fact that she was dressed so well shows me that she has to work harder to be taken seriously. I don't know what was in your apology email but I would consider sending a well thought out follow up detailing how you know the mistakes that you made, how you plan to rectify this particular situation, and how you plan to better yourself to not make the same mistakes in the future.", "YTA. You have some sexist views, it seems, and they caught up to you. Communication is always key. Had you asked her name, you would've known she was the engineer. Don't judge based on appearance, gender, race, religion... it just doesn't end well.", "I know you didn't mean to be, but YTA.\n\nYou initially assumed it was a man. It was not confirmed nor denied, so you continued the assumption. You see a young woman and immediately skip over the idea that the engineer could be her. Didn't even cross your mind.\n\nSorry my friend, but that would be sexist. You have a pre-conceived notion of roles women take (HR for example), and roles for men. \n\nYTA, and you owe a serious apology. You are not the first man to do this, nor will you be the last. In male dominated fields women have to work hard to be taken seriously, and this woman is taking no sh*t, which I applaud.", "You made a logical conclusion based on your experience and interactions with others prior to meeting.\n\nBut then... you met her and assumed she was... an assistant?\n\nYup.

It\u2019s 2023 and this crap is still happening? YTA big time.", "Wow - how are you not the asshole? Even with all of your reasoning as to why you wouldn\u2019t think she was the engineer, you don\u2019t introduce yourself and just come in making demands?!  Definite YTA.", "YTA. You keep talking about your manager not correcting you but you are the asshole because you never even thought to ask. You assumed it was a man.", "YTA. \nThis still happens to me frequently.

What the hell does that even mean? You didn't hear that name before and didn't know if it was given to men or women? It is a foreign name, so you have no context about the gender?

Or Peter or William, or...", "YTA. \n\nHoly crap.", "Yes, you are indeed the asshole. \n\nAfter she told you she was the engineer, it was so unbelievable to you that you LOOKED UP HER CREDENTIALS. \n\nAbsolutely gross sexism on display, and you should be embarrassed. \n\nYTA", "YTA for not considering that she could have been the person you were waiting for but as an electrical engineer myself, there were very few women in my classes. Organizations like SWE were always trying to get more to choose engineering and were quite successful on my campus after I graduated. So you might start seeing more of them in the future.", "YTA. So much wrong with this, I don\u2019t have that much time. \nIn short, regardless of who you thought she was or wasn\u2019t, a professional person would have entered the room, noted that you haven\u2019t met before and approached her and introduced yourself. At which point she would have introduced herself in return, and you\u2019d know immediately who she was.\nSee how easy that is when you just behave like an intelligent professional and not a sexist ass?", "YTA of course. Some healthy and sincere grovelling may get you out of this one. But you are going to have to own your mistake, apologise up front and keep apologising. There is no way you can laugh this off as an innocent mistake.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve asked who she was?", "It doesn't matter why or how this happened.

I am a software engineer but work with some very custom hardware chips in my day to day. \n\nMy team needed to integrate a new micro controller into a product we are designing and since I am the lead for the software that will interact with this component my manager set up a meeting for me with the electrical engineer in charge of designing that component who is on a different team.\n\nI have worked with various such other teams in the past but this component was one that is considered quite specialized. When my manager and I talked about it, he did not refer much to the engineer I would be meeting and refereed to the team and used the they/them pronoun. I refereed to the designer as he many times and my manager did not correct me. The name was also very gender neutral.\n\nWhen I went to the meeting room, there was a younger woman in the room probably in her mid to late 20s. None of the electrical engineers I have met before at my company have been women and in general the few women engineers we have all work on things like web and front end interface development. Since my manager had not corrected me when I said he/him, I assumed this person was some kind of product manager on their team or something. She was also very dressed up, in a skirt, heels and makeup which is an attire product managers and HR people typically have. I also would have expected someone in this position to be much older.\n\nSo, I told her, Ill be right back and make coffee while we wait for the engineer to arrive and to message me on slack if he arrives. When I got back, I said something like \"he hasn't arrived yet\".\n\nShe then finally mentioned she was the engineer and angrily stormed out. I sent an apology email to her but she has not responded yet but an HR representative has added a meeting to my work calendar and I can see that she has a meeting at the same time on hers.\n\nAITA here? I feel embarrassed and I did not mean to assume she was not the engineer, had my manager told me, or had she had a feminine name or profile picture I would have not done so. I looked up her profile and she really is the most qualified person to work with me on this even though she is really young.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm in my early 30s and am constantly being talked down to and assumed to just be \"office help\".\n\nThere'd probably be more of us in male-dominated fields if we weren't demeaned all the time, assumed to be useless/unhelpful, sexually harassed, or not know what we're talking about. But, so many don't want to put up with that bullshit (100% don't blame them), so they leave. Life is hard enough.\n\nWish your daughter luck! I hope she finds a good work environment and enjoys herself.", "Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll be fine! I\u2019m a plumbing/fire protection engineer in my mid 30s but I look much younger, I\u2019m blonde and dress nicely (shocking I know lol). While I still get some surprised looks from the clients and senior engineers from other companies, that all changes as soon as I start talking about my work. As long as she knows what she\u2019s doing and is assertive, she\u2019ll do well.", "She'll be fine.  Speaking as a female engineer in my 60's.  Aerospace has its fossils but there's a lot of young women coming up.", "Thankfully it\u2019s not the 70\u2019s or 80\u2019s and she actually has some legal recourse\u2026 well I like to think so anyway", "I have lost so many jobs to men who \u201cjust seemed like a better fit\u201d, at least one of whom was totally unqualified. Two companies were nearly all male (and 100% men in the tech and product roles), both claimed they were making an intentional effort to correct that, both took me all the way to the final round, one actually gave me a verbal offer, and then both hired men. \n\nI\u2019m about 25 years in and it\u2019s so hard to hold out hope that my career is going to go anywhere. I\u2019ve been hustling harder than my partner, watching him get lifted up and given amazing chances, while my career plateaued a decade ago. It\u2019s so depressing. I\u2019m still hustling.", "I work in the Bay Area, most of my clients are tech and a lot are MtF trans women. They have a unique perspective and the sexism is terrible. They\u2019re treated so differently being seen as a woman as opposed to a man.", "If it helps. I have a mom who\u2019s an actual legend. Like, she wrote a book on some security topics, has RFCs, though they\u2019re old now, and served on some letter commitees that qualify you to have your opinion matter on internet stuff.\n\nThing is, she looks like what she also is, which is the stereotype of a cute little grandma, round and adorable. \n\nWatching Verizon employees on a residential install at her new house talk down to her is one of my favorite activities. It\u2019s really fun watching their nuts retract when they assure her \u201cWEP is fine and totally secure\u201d and they receive a friendly lecture.\n\nShe\u2019s too nice for this earth, so if you ask her for stories of people behaving badly, she\u2019ll deflect, but I bet she has a few good professional examples of getting mansplained I\u2019ll never get out of her lol.", "I was friends with Judy Estrin (yes, that Judy Estrin) and so many men treated her like she didn\u2019t know anything for simply being a woman. People would ask her what she did for a living\u2026 \u201coh, just look me up on Wikipedia.\u201d", "My goal in life is to make the good old boys shake in their boots \ud83d\ude03", "This all the way.  Prepare so you know what to do, but also surround yourself with women and allies who can advise you and act as role models.\n\nWe may still be the minority, but we're there.", "My mother was a mechanical engineer. She qualified in the 60s.", "You\u2019re not a chicken. You just chose self-preservation. That\u2019s okay", "Yes.  I was (and am) married to her.", "I\u2019d respond:  are you as dumb as you sound?", "20 years in hospital IT leadership roles, learned to (fake)laugh at their jokes on conference calls and pitch my voice up a little to get them all agreeable and doing what needed to be done. Patient care comes first after all, even if it was ridiculous and annoying. But god help them when they fucked up or tried to school me;  my voice would drop to normal and I\u2019d eviscerate them with laser focus. The sound of assholes clanging shut in fear on a conf call was so enjoyable. One guy was so embarrassed when I handed him his ass that he never got on a call again, always made his buddy do it.", "My mom was a computer scientist/software engineer/coder right around then (graduated from college in '67).  The stories she could tell...", "That's awesome! I would be very proud of her for standing up and going against the grain.", "I hear you. I was the only girl in my Calc 3 and Dif Eq classes. Never mind the fact that I took them my freshman year. I did dual enrollment in 11th grade (precaculus and statistics) and 12th grade (Calc 1 and 2) to get me ahead. I got more crazy looks than my professor's 12 year old son who audited calc 3 with us. Because you know, back then we weren't seen as being capable for some reason. Same with my physics and chemistry classes.", "Same. I switched out of aeronautical engineering in 1995. It sucked being a woman in my classes. Finished with a bullshit degree. Ended up going into tech. I\u2019ve been the only woman on every team I\u2019ve worked on for 20+ years. Im in infrastructure- server, storage, VMware, etc.", "All the brain went to my boobies didn't you know that's how it works???? /s lol\n\nAnd it was really sad because I think he thought it was the nicest thing in the world. He tried using my age and tattoos when my coworkers pressed him about it too", "I have been described in those exact terms! I don't necessarily feel like I'm a nice bubbly person, but it's the way I'm described and so often that apparently means I'm an idiot? I'm nice because it was beaten into me, but it's been a learning process to assert myself when I know I'm suggesting the right thing,  and refusing to be overlooked. \n\nMy PI and the postdoc in my lab have really taught me to be more confident and not put up with bullshit, the funny thing is they're pretty much the same age as I am."]}
