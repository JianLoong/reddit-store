I\u2019ve advised her to communicate, communicate, communicate but she says his words speak louder than his actions. To me, clearly they aren\u2019t clicking the way they once did or thought they did. After so many occasions like this I\u2019m tired of hearing about it and told her to break up with him.

I know she won\u2019t break it off because despite everything it\u2019s clear that she genuinely likes him but I know she will just continue to get upset by this.  At this point it\u2019s a regular occurrence. I\u2019m getting really tired of hearing about this over and over and over.
