You\u2019re European so it is more common that couples split the bill evenly. Still he is breaking his promise to you, in promising to pay luring your to a place you would not otherwise choose and sticking you with the bill. \n\nMost importantly, if he\u2019s rich at 18 this seems like it\u2019s actually daddy\u2019s money. So daddy has a right to know how it\u2019s being spent. The fact that he was surprised his son was not paying is telling, and I imagine your bf has been essentially embezzling money from his parents they thought we\u2019re paying for his dates with you. \n\nHe sounds immature and not worth your time.", "NTA, but why are you with him?  I'm not saying he should always pay your way, but if he does expect you to pay your half, you two need to go to places you can afford.", "NTA. If being a \"gentleman\" in his family means paying, he is not being a gentleman. The way he's been treating you has been callous as well (not letting you know about expenses ahead of time so you can budget or decline). Frankly, he deserved to get a talking to from his father. \n\nNow you need to talk to him about making financial arrangements clear from the start. If he has led you to believe he would pay for something, don't just pay, call him out on it.", "INFO: why on earth are you with this person?", "NTA\n\nSeriously why are you with this guy?\n\n>Also one time he bought museum tickets for a museum he wanted to visit and said \u201cYou own me 14\u20ac if you want to\u201d what am I supposed to say? \u201cno I don\u2019t\u201d?? of course I would pay it.\n\nNo one who cares for their partner would pull this bullshit. If you bought tickets to something you like and invite your partner it should mean you want to share your interests and hobbies with them. It should be inviting you out to a stress free date to enjoy time together. Wtf is this 'I already got the tickets without asking if you wanted to go so now you owe me' bullshit? \n\nPlease have some self-respect and if you won't dump him at least stand up for yourself and tell him that kind of behavior is not acceptable. It shouldn't be an \"of course you will pay it.\" It should've been a \"I'm not interested, have fun and enjoy yourself\"", "NTA.\n\nHe offers to cover your cost, knowing that you can't afford to go out a lot from previous financial discussions, and then makes you split the cost anyway. This is a form of gaslighting. He deserved to be embarrassed in front of his dad, maybe he'll stop this behavior. If he's offering to pay, he should pay. Period. If he wants to split things, he should tell you that upfront so you can decide if you want to go out or not beforehand without putting you on the spot and expecting money when you're in a hard place financially. And he should never steal your change if you're splitting costs. If he throws that at you last second again, I would ask the waiter/waitress to do separate checks so you can pay your share and he can pay his. Just sure you're keeping your own ordering within your budget in case this happens.\n\nI would break up with him though if this is a consistent issue. You're obviously not on the same page when it comes to financial expectations and spending habits. That's hard to get through, speaking as someone who has been there.", "Grow a backbone.\n\nWhen he doesn\u2019t give you change: You owe me 3 back.\n\nWhen he surprise asks you to pay: I thought you said you were paying today? \n\nWith the museum tickets: No, I can\u2019t afford it, ask someone else\n\nWhen he asks to go out and you don\u2019t want to: Mo I don\u2019t want to go out.", "NTA\n\nYour bf doesn\u2019t like the truth. He\u2019s embarrassed about his own behaviour and can\u2019t admit it so he takes it out on you.", "NTA.\nBig up to his dad! He\u2019s trying to raise a gentleman. \nRegarding your boyfriend, he should have anticipated his father\u2019s reaction and not let you pay. At least not that time. I agree that sometimes you should pay your half but that wasn\u2019t one of those times. Not your fault", "What you do now is break up with him. He is a cheapskate and an AH. You can do better. NTA", "NTA, if that's how he is and he doesn't want his family to know he should have communicated.\nJust like how he should of communicated his expectations for you to pay.\nRemember that you are worth sticking up for and it's ok to say no if you can't afford it. Financial security is not less important than a man", "\"what am I supposed to say? \u201cno I don\u2019t\u201d??\" Well actually, yes.\n\n\"It's OK, I don't want to see the museum that much and was only going for you. I'm sure you can find someone who wants to go.\"\n\nOr\n\nWhen the waiter takes your order \"I think I'm going to be paying for myself tonight. Can you make sure to do 2 bills and i'll pay on card for mine (thus stopping any 'change stealing' and any subsidising his plate.)\n\nOr, my favourite\n\n\"We have 2 very different ideas about how this relationship should work. As such, I think it's best if we go our separate ways.\"", "NTA. maybe now he will actually change his ungentlemanly behaviour", "NTA, it sounds like he's constantly testing you. That means he doesn't think your enough for him. That is a horrible position in a relationship. Don't ever settle for someone that doesn't make you feel like they are excited to be with you. You'll find someone that you're excited to be with and they are excited to be with you. That's not this.", "You are young and this is not how a man who cares treats a partner; you may not have enough experience to tell.\n\nBe strong, don't let him make you pay for things you cannot afford. Discuss who will pay for what before you go out. Otherwise, move on to someone who will care about you and take what you say as important.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's not about the fact he expects you to pay something, it's about how he goes about this nonsense. You should probably have had a conversation about how you're going to split date nights a long time ago, so you're never surprised or left wondering exactly how much you're going to be spending. Your boyfriend could have kept this from happening by telling you dinner was entirely on him tonight, or by warning you that his Dad would think he's an ass for making you pay. \n\nHowever, you might want to have another chat with your BFF. Maybe the reason she doesn't like him, combined with his embarrassing behavior on dates, is a good reason to re-evaluate your decision to date.", "NTA", "NTA, you spoke truthfully and didn't give a false impression of your relationship.", "NTA, but dump this AH!
