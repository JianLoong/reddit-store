{"id": 3214, "submission_id": "z4f3u0", "title": "AITA for snapping at a teacher?", "selftext": "So I F15 just recently transferred to a new school due to a move after my parent got divorced. now the first couple days went by really well and I'm mostly enjoying the school. Now my first couple days I got to know most of my new teachers, besides one who was off for a couple days due to sickness and we had a sub. Now from what I've heard this teacher, we'll call him Mr. Jones, is a really good teacher so I was excited to have him compared to other teachers of the same subject. When I first started the new school I informed all the teachers that I was deaf, I don't really need an ASL translator because I can read lips like a boss and my teachers have since used lesson plans that I'm able to follow along with by the instructions on the board and if I don't understand then they pay me a bit more attention in class so that way I don't fall behind which I appreciate. All of this changed when Mr. Jones got back though. Class seemed to be going fine until we got to doing a practical exercise, which I didn't really understand the instructions that he had given because he spoke to fast for me to lip read him and the instructions weren't on the board so I was completely lost. I asked him to repeat the instructions a couple times but that still didn't help, which I eventually got help from another student sitting next to me. After class he held me back for a few minutes to chat with me and ask why I as a new student was giving him a hard time. I told him that I wasn't giving him a hard time I just didn't understand the instructions and needed them repeated because I was deaf. He told me that he couldn't repeat the same instructions multiple times when they were fairly straightforward. He then told me that I wasn't deaf because I don't look deaf and I responded kinda shocked to hear that come from a teachers mouth. I asked him what a deaf person looked like and he responded that I didn't have a hearing aide or a cochlear implant. I responded that they wouldn't do me any good as I was completely deaf, why spend money on something that wouldn't be useful to me. He then told me that if I was completely deaf then I shouldn't be able to be talking with him right now and that if I was really deaf I should be put into a class with kids with disabilities. I was now mad because that was just too far to go and so I snapped at him. I told him that one I was able to read lips and having a one on one conversation close by I was able to read lips just fine and that two no I didn't need to be in a class with other people with disabilities because I wasn't taking the learning abilities away from other students and all my other classes are fine just this class.

Over here teachers get told beforehand if a class has a student with a disability so they can accommodate the student in question accordingly.", "NTA.

I have no clue where OP is from, but it is not all that far fetched to believe that OP - having a hearing disability - is not receiving the accommodations necessary and is being treated like this by a teacher. \n\nWhen I was growing up, some students with disabilities at my school didn\u2019t have parents who were willing/able to put forth the effort to advocate for an IEP. My best friend had an IEP and was regularly neglected by several teachers and even told they were just \u201cmaking excuses\u201d. One of my clients (also from the south) recently shared a story with me of being *literally locked in a box* by one of their teachers because they talked too much in class and wandered around during lesson (news flash: they have ADHD and anxiety). A friend of mine has a cousin with autism that was locked in a closet because they were \u201ctoo much\u201d. And these stories aren\u2019t from decades and decades ago. This is stuff that continues to happen in our schools.\n\nI\u2019m not saying OP\u2019s story is 100% true. Because maybe it isn\u2019t.

And to be clear, I'm not saying teachers don't ignore the IEP.

That\u2019s gotta be frustrating enough to make anyone snap. Especially is she\u2019s had this experience before.
