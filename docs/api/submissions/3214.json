{"id": 3214, "submission_id": "z4f3u0", "title": "AITA for snapping at a teacher?", "selftext": "So I F15 just recently transferred to a new school due to a move after my parent got divorced. now the first couple days went by really well and I'm mostly enjoying the school. Now my first couple days I got to know most of my new teachers, besides one who was off for a couple days due to sickness and we had a sub. Now from what I've heard this teacher, we'll call him Mr. Jones, is a really good teacher so I was excited to have him compared to other teachers of the same subject. When I first started the new school I informed all the teachers that I was deaf, I don't really need an ASL translator because I can read lips like a boss and my teachers have since used lesson plans that I'm able to follow along with by the instructions on the board and if I don't understand then they pay me a bit more attention in class so that way I don't fall behind which I appreciate. All of this changed when Mr. Jones got back though. Class seemed to be going fine until we got to doing a practical exercise, which I didn't really understand the instructions that he had given because he spoke to fast for me to lip read him and the instructions weren't on the board so I was completely lost. I asked him to repeat the instructions a couple times but that still didn't help, which I eventually got help from another student sitting next to me. After class he held me back for a few minutes to chat with me and ask why I as a new student was giving him a hard time. I told him that I wasn't giving him a hard time I just didn't understand the instructions and needed them repeated because I was deaf. He told me that he couldn't repeat the same instructions multiple times when they were fairly straightforward. He then told me that I wasn't deaf because I don't look deaf and I responded kinda shocked to hear that come from a teachers mouth. I asked him what a deaf person looked like and he responded that I didn't have a hearing aide or a cochlear implant. I responded that they wouldn't do me any good as I was completely deaf, why spend money on something that wouldn't be useful to me. He then told me that if I was completely deaf then I shouldn't be able to be talking with him right now and that if I was really deaf I should be put into a class with kids with disabilities. I was now mad because that was just too far to go and so I snapped at him. I told him that one I was able to read lips and having a one on one conversation close by I was able to read lips just fine and that two no I didn't need to be in a class with other people with disabilities because I wasn't taking the learning abilities away from other students and all my other classes are fine just this class.

Teacher here (former in classroom but now online). You are hearing impaired. According to federal law, you fall under the category of a law called IDEA.

He did not read them or care to implement them. You have access to a visual aid or hearing aid. You chose not to use ONE but if you ask for repeated instructions or additional time, THESE are ALSO ACCOMODATIONS. The fact that you're teacher had a problem with providing the instructions again and suggested you be moved to a \"classroom with students with other disabilities\", means he does not know what he's talking about. He just violated IDEA. You need to have your parents arrange a parent teacher cone with your ESE teacher and a guidance counselor or Assistant Principal. Have them go over your accommodations on your IEP plan with EACH of your teachers. The law was created to insure that students such as yourself do not fall between and beneath the cracks. You should not be penalized by a teacher who is not farmiliar with his job and does not know what he is doing.

The cornerstone of your IEP is that you, as the student, and your parents, get to pick the least restrictive environment. You also get to chose your communication modalities, your accommodations. Your parents need to contact the SPED coordinator of your  district because this teacher is violating your rights under IDEA. Special Education means SERVICES, and it is NOT A PLACE.

You can sue.", "NTA. Special Education teachere here. And I am curious, do you have an iep or a 504. I get that you don't have learning disabilities and are successful in a general education classroom   but an IEP or 504 will ensure that your teacher not act like an ignorant idiot and legally it can be required that he put the directions on the board for you.", "Wow - what a c0ck", "In the school system I work in this would be an admin issue, Counselor would not have any authority here", "HOH/moderate to profound deafness in both ears.

As a teacher of 15 year olds, he probably gets students being idiots, lying to him and pulling crap like that all the time. I'm not completely surprised his first reaction was to not believe you. Wrong on his part - but understandable, surely.\n\nI know it must be very frustrating for you, but I think you should be patient and allow him to redeem himself.

So for everyone it's different because everyone is a different person but for me I wasn't born deaf, I lost my hearing as a kid so I already knew how to talk.

We all coming.", "Not even don't seem deaf, don't *look* deaf", "As with everything related to education in the U.S. (where education is controlled at the local, not federal, level, unlike many other countries) this is going to vary widely by school. In a perfect world, yes, all classroom teachers would be informed about a student arriving with an IEP or 504 but the reality is that special ed compliance is VERY uneven. The fact that it is a 504 (vs IEP) likely makes it worse, as there will be no case manager assigned but a school wide 504 coordinator who is often a guidance counselor or administrator. (If memory serves, special educators cannot by law also serve as 504 coordinators.) My experience is that managing 504s falls to the bottom of that person\u2019s to-do list. The sending school may not even have sent it over; we\u2019ve had students for over a year before discovering they have a 504 that was never sent over.\n\nRegardless, OP, you are LEGALLY ENTITLED to the accommodations in your 504. That\u2019s not open to discussion or negotiation; it\u2019s law. Any teacher with that poor of an understanding of special-ed law needs to be out of the classroom until he\u2019s caught up to speed because he\u2019s violating your civil rights and putting his school in legal jeopardy too.", "Could you two please stop arguing?

I don't blame the writers of the ieps I blame the systems in place. Whether it be not enough funding, not enough people to work through them etc. However, no student should be subjected to that type of wait during the school year.  I can see during summer months it taking a bit longer. If the district has all the needed paperwork making anyone wait that amount of time is just plain unfair to the student. Just mho on it. I used to work at college level OSD and would advise students who were high school junior and senior have the latest psychological education test on file within 3 years and a copy of your iep/504 plans. In this particular case it is physical and the schools have OP files. They are just taking their sweet time when it has a negative impact on the student. Especially in the case of this particular teacher."]}
