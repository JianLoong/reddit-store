Now my first couple days I got to know most of my new teachers, besides one who was off for a couple days due to sickness and we had a sub. Now from what I've heard this teacher, we'll call him Mr. Jones, is a really good teacher so I was excited to have him compared to other teachers of the same subject. When I first started the new school I informed all the teachers that I was deaf, I don't really need an ASL translator because I can read lips like a boss and my teachers have since used lesson plans that I'm able to follow along with by the instructions on the board and if I don't understand then they pay me a bit more attention in class so that way I don't fall behind which I appreciate. All of this changed when Mr. Jones got back though. Class seemed to be going fine until we got to doing a practical exercise, which I didn't really understand the instructions that he had given because he spoke to fast for me to lip read him and the instructions weren't on the board so I was completely lost. I asked him to repeat the instructions a couple times but that still didn't help, which I eventually got help from another student sitting next to me. After class he held me back for a few minutes to chat with me and ask why I as a new student was giving him a hard time. I told him that I wasn't giving him a hard time I just didn't understand the instructions and needed them repeated because I was deaf. He told me that he couldn't repeat the same instructions multiple times when they were fairly straightforward. He then told me that I wasn't deaf because I don't look deaf and I responded kinda shocked to hear that come from a teachers mouth. I asked him what a deaf person looked like and he responded that I didn't have a hearing aide or a cochlear implant. I responded that they wouldn't do me any good as I was completely deaf, why spend money on something that wouldn't be useful to me. He then told me that if I was completely deaf then I shouldn't be able to be talking with him right now and that if I was really deaf I should be put into a class with kids with disabilities. I was now mad because that was just too far to go and so I snapped at him. I told him that one I was able to read lips and having a one on one conversation close by I was able to read lips just fine and that two no I didn't need to be in a class with other people with disabilities because I wasn't taking the learning abilities away from other students and all my other classes are fine just this class.

Teacher here (former in classroom but now online). You are hearing impaired. According to federal law, you fall under the category of a law called IDEA.

Those accommodations are detailed an IEP which is your written plan detailing how you are to receive your education. the goal of you obtaining your education should be receiving the same education an an inclusive environment. This means you're supposed to learn in the classroom. Removing you and putting you in another classroom goes against the IDEA law. Your teacher should have gotten your accommodations. He did not read them or care to implement them. You have access to a visual aid or hearing aid. You chose not to use ONE but if you ask for repeated instructions or additional time, THESE are ALSO ACCOMODATIONS. The fact that you're teacher had a problem with providing the instructions again and suggested you be moved to a \"classroom with students with other disabilities\", means he does not know what he's talking about. He just violated IDEA. You need to have your parents arrange a parent teacher cone with your ESE teacher and a guidance counselor or Assistant Principal. Have them go over your accommodations on your IEP plan with EACH of your teachers. The law was created to insure that students such as yourself do not fall between and beneath the cracks. You should not be penalized by a teacher who is not farmiliar with his job and does not know what he is doing.
