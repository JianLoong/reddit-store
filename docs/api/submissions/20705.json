My dad doesn\u2019t usually do this intentionally, but he has seriously embarrassed me or gotten me in hot water by sharing before.\n\nNow, in case you\u2019re wondering, I am not talking about folks who do the normal parent shit like share baby stories or embarrassing times growing up. I mean they\u2019ll tell people I just started a huge new job after I submitted a resume with someone, or try to tell clients and bosses about my professional skills in a way that scares off clients by making me sound like an idiot, or misrepresent stories to sound less capable.\n\nits worse with my mom, who will outright jump on the bandwagon to bash me when people aren\u2019t happy about what she told them not adding up or something just not work out. As an example, 4 months ago I got offered a good job in my field that didn\u2019t end up panning out. The company ended up being really shady and I didn\u2019t want to broadcast this until I knew I had something to talk about. Well, you know who told her circle.

I told my dad that I was feeling sick this morning but I was still going to help the guy out. I talked to him at 11, and was ready to start working. He told me he would give me a call when he was done with his morning errands. I waited all day for him to call, and didn\u2019t hear back. Apparently dad had taken it upon himself to tell the guy I felt sick this morning and didn\u2019t go to my morning college course. I know the guy.

He\u2019s gunna be pissy and I\u2019m gunna have to fix it.\n\nI\u2019m not proud of it but I went off on my dad about how I need him to stop trying to speak for me, and not to tell other people my business.
