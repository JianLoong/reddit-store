During this time I and my husband (Her stepfather) have been hands-on in making sure that my daughter's wedding is exactly how she wanted it. My husband has been taking money out of his savings so he can help pay for the wedding and I can strongly say this wedding would not be half as good without his help. My husband hasn't made any demands but did say he wanted some vegan options (which he paid for) because he's vegan. My daughter has been acting very nice towards him until everything for the wedding was paid for.\n\nRecently I was checking the sitting arrangements and I only saw my name. I didn't see a seat for my husband and my other kids who I had with my current husband plus I was arranged to sit next to her biological father. I brought this up to her and she simply said that none of her parent's significant others were invited which wasn't fair because her biological father wasn't with anyone. I got upset and yelled at how selfish she was because she had no problem letting my husband pay for more than half the wedding but now she has a problem with him attending it. She brought up how she didn't want to make her bio father uncomfortable so I told her that if she didn't fix it I would get a refund for the whole wedding and since she cares about her biological dad more than the man who's been there for her and made sure she was taken care of then he can spend all the money he spent on her wedding on his biological kids. I also told her I wouldn't attend the wedding which made her cry because we were supposed to have a mother-daughter dance. \n\nI know you guys will ask what their relationship is like and I can fully heartily say that their relationship was on her terms. There would be times when they would be close and then when she comes back from her dad's she ignores him. I told my husband how he and the kids weren't invited and he's upset and hurt.

This is a hard situation all around but I don\u2019t know that bulldozing eachothers needs serves anyone.\n\n*Edit: An additional thought - my husband and I fronted the wedding in its entirety which is why I probably felt more empowered with the guest list. Be honest - if she paid for the wedding herself and didn\u2019t invite your husband/other kids, would you still be considering not coming? Is it the investment you\u2019re pissed about or the lack of invitation? If it\u2019s the investment, perhaps tell her you will set up a repayment contract or will be forced to refund.

If she's ungrateful then I guess she's ungrateful but she's too old to be disciplined now. It's her wedding so whoever she wants to be there will be there.\n\nI'm sorry she isn't treating your husband right but you can't force a relationship with them. If she doesn't want one then it's on her. Even if her father is an ass she chose him. \n\nIf I was getting married I'd choose My bio dad over my step dad any day of the week. So just ask for the money back since that's clearly what you have on her and don't go\n\nIt's your daughter not your husband. Your grandchildren will be affected by the choice you make today. She's starting her own family and you'll have no say in it", "While I think you're definitely NTA and your husband should cancel whatever he can and ask for refunds, I do want to point out that you're slightly wrong. My parents divorced when my sister was an infant and I was a toddler, and at the time of my sister's wedding, my mother was married to my stepfather and my father had divorced his wife a couple of years prior. Our biological parents sat together and the bridal table next to my sister, while our stepfather sat together with me and my grandma. Nobody made a fuss. Both our our parents and our stepfather (as well as the groom's parents) contributed in different ways to the wedding. If my sister would've taken money contributions from our stepdad and then not invited him, all hell would have broken loose though and that's why you're NTA. But it would've been strange to have your current husband sit next to you by the bridal table..", "And here the bride made a different decision and everybody has to live with that and the consequences.\n\nIf mother cannot handle that, she is free to not attend, with the consequences for the relationship with the bride that that entails. \nAnd the bride herself made clear who she sees as family and who she does not see that way. \n\nIt can easily just be \nBride and groom and bio parents\n\nAnd the rest literally has no business being in such a picture. Blood and nothing more.", "So we should just skip giving them the option? If a refund is on the table then mom can still request it if daughter doesn\u2019t do the right thing.", "You and I are on the exact same page lol this is what I commented. If you don\u2019t want to go don\u2019t go, ask for the money back. But say goodbye to the daughter and her new family!", "I've only replied to you because you claim that going nc wouldn't affect my husband because it does. If she wants to always pick her father over me, her stepdad, and her siblings then she can do that. All I can say is I hope that her new inlaws are loving because if she's relying on her father she's gonna be one lonely woman.", "We raise our kids to leave the hen anyways, right? If I lose her because she wanted to be rude and dismiss everyone's feelings except her dad then she can go ahead.", "She didn't pick your ex over you. She picked her ex over your husband. You just can't see that. To her it's you and her dad. To you it's you her dad and your husband. You can't force it on her. Up to you though. I'd say You're being immature as well. You chose your husband over your daughter and that's how she'll see it.\n\nUp to you", "Yikes. There\u2019s so many options and the first that you\u2019re going with is not attending her wedding and cutting ties without even considering negotiating her repayment of your husband, family counseling\u2026nothing? This all sounds so transactional. You get what you want or you punish her. She gets what she wants or punishes you. You guys are treating each other abominably.", ">She didn't pick your ex over you. She picked her ex over your husband.\n\nYou do realize that she didn't have to pick anybody over anybody right? She could have invited both her father and stepfather to the wedding, right.\n\nIt's not a dick move to want her father to walk her down the aisle or do the father/daughter dance, but to prevent the stepfather from even attending? That's a dick move.\n\nShe's purposefully excluding the stepfather and her siblings; but postponed revealing that until she gets every cent she can from him. That's deceitful and a textbook lie by omission.\n\nThe daughter is the AH.", "I would not be the one cutting ties. If she doesn't wanna talk to me because I don't attend her wedding then that's her decision. She doesn't even consider her stepdad \"family\" by the way she's acting. So counseling would be pointless.", "Of course it is but if the mother doesn't want to go to her daughter's wedding might as well kiss the relationship goodbye as well. I don't care about the step dad because she doesn't either.\n\nIf my mother doesn't come to my wedding she can kiss my family goodbye. \n\nIf her mother doesn't want to attend she should just say so. Don't put it on the daughter, it was her decision not to go. \n\nLike I said she should get her money back and not go. It's not her mothers day so whatever she wants she gets. \n\nThis isn't even outrageous, plenty of kids don't invite their step parents and rather invite their bio dad. \n\nAs stated she cares more about bio dad's feelings then her step dad"]}
