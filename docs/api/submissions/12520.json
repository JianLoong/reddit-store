You will have those memories to look back on one day as a family of 5. Don\u2019t relent and tell the other siblings that their kids need to realize that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around them. \nWhat happens when the other kids get upset that you\u2019re adopting those 3 girls and not them? Are you going to have to change that too to make them happy? It\u2019s not the same relationship to compare.

You're including your *foster children*, who may soon be *your children*. You're not including *any* nieces.\n\n>they're saying they can't tell their kids that their cousins are in the wedding and they're not because I don't love them as much. \n\nWell yeah, because if they said that they'd be horrible people, horrible parents, and lying assholes.\n\nYou're including their cousins because you have a different relationship with them. This is a great learning opportunity for your nieces about how there can be different types of families. And the reason isn't that you love them *less*, it's that you love them *differently*.\n\nThese siblings sound like entitled AHs. \n\nYou are NTA", ">they're saying they can't tell their kids that their cousins are in the wedding and they're not because I don't love them as much\n\nWho in their right mind would ever even think about saying anything like that to any child? Apparently since all these relatives have completely lost their sanity over this, perhaps OP and spouses can gather all the cousins together for a fun meal at Chuck E Cheese or other kiddie place and tell all the children themselves. \u201cWe love all of you so much that we would never want to do anything to hurt your feelings. We can\u2019t have everyone be a flower girl or ring bearer so we decided to a fair way to choose would be to have the children who we are going to live with us do those jobs this time. We wanted to tell you how we decided and how much we love you all.\u201d Simple \n\nIf you want to do so, you could also offer to let you know if there is a special job any of them would like to do at the wedding. Someone taking music lessons might want to perform something for you. Someone else might want to help design some of the decorations. I assume everyone would want to help taste cake flavors.", "NTA they're your kids, it's completely differ. And it sounds like they've had a really rough time, why cant their aunts and uncles just be happy for them?", "You sure Ava, Ellie, and Lilly's bio mom is the only sibling who doesn't know how to parent?\n\nTelling the cousins that A, E, and L are in the wedding because they live with you isn't hard. Nor is it a concept that the cousins won't understand. Especially if they're told A, E, and L are going to be your daughters, not your nieces. Those are some simple concepts.\n\nI think your siblings are upset because they want cute photos of their kids all dressed up and walking down the aisle. And now the *parents* are butt hurt that A, E, and L will have those photos, not the other cousins. If the kids are upset, I'm going to bet that at least some of them were being hyped up for the roles by their parents. \"Are you excited to wear a pretty dress?\" \"Let's practice throwing flowers for so-and-so's wedding!\" Which still means that this is the parent's problem, and one they created themselves. So they can deal with it, get over themselves, and learn to parent. Or stay home if they think they matter more on your wedding day than you do.\n\nNTA.", "Nta", "Nta you.arent dividing nieces and nephews you are having your kids in your wedding.", "NTA. First of all, it would be pure chaos to have all the nieces and nephews in the wedding. What are you supposed to do? Have 6 nephews carry empty pillows? The nieces that will be in the wedding live with you! It is not that difficult to explain that to their kids. Flip this on the siblings. They are the ones that are making this into a \u201cyou love them more\u201d, so are you required to take custody of their kids also to show how much you love their kids also? No? Because their kids are fine and don\u2019t need that? Ok, then why are they treating the nieces in your care like they aren\u2019t a member of your household? I would hope that if the girls were your biological daughters your siblings wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s not fair to include them and not the nieces and nephews.", "NTA and this is simple.\n\nthese girls are no longer just your nieces. they are your children. you raise them, you house them, they call you their parents which will likely be formalized and legally reinforced if/when the adoption process goes through.\n\nif your combined siblings continue getting shirty about you favoring your \"nieces\", you need to redirect the conversation:  \n\n\n>We said that there are no niblings would be involved in the wedding party, and that is still true. Ava and Lily and Ellie are *not* our niblings - they are our children. I'm sorry if you are unable to understand the difference but that is not our problem. If you choose to escalate this feelings by emotionally manipulating your children rather than explaining the difference, that is also not our problem. We hope to have you all there to celebrate with us but if this is too much of an issue for you, we respect your decision to not be there.\n\nany continued whining just gets pushed back to the script or to \"we've already discussed why we want our children involved in our wedding, there's nothing more to discuss\". repeat ad nauseum until all siblings get the memo.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding, and those are your kids. They should be there, and it wouldn\u2019t be weird if your kids are the only kids attending. \n\nIf you decide that kids are allowed and you\u2019re inviting *all* your nieces and nephews, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to have them involved. Maybe plan a day, order pizza and ice cream, and have all the kids help out with DIY wedding decor, like making paper cranes or putting together wedding favors.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
