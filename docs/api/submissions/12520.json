Not likely", "Eff all of them. They are your kids. This is your wedding. End of discussion. NTA. At. ALL.", "Lol how can people believe this", "I mean, I\u2019m totally here for a wedding street gang of nieces and nephews throwing flowers at all the guests down the aisle, but NTA OP. It\u2019s perfectly okay for kids to be told \u201cNo.\u201d the three nieces you are having in your wedding are going to be your adopted children in the near future, and it\u2019s not like there is only one other niece you are leaving out, there\u2019s like, a football teams worth of nieces and nephews not participating. The kids will be fine. I bet they won\u2019t even care. \n\nI had lots of kids in my wedding and at my wedding (4 flower girls, 2 ring bearers, 15 more kids at the wedding), and we made each kid a sand pail with their name on it and stuffed it with chalk, and glow sticks, snacks, and all sorts of stuff for them to play with at the reception (was outside). We bought hula hoops and outdoor games. They all had so much fun. I\u2019ve never heard a peep from my other nieces and nephews about them not being in my wedding. They did not care. They were up late dancing their little hearts out having the time of their lives.\n\nDo what you want. The people that matter won\u2019t care, and the people who care don\u2019t matter.", "Nta. Your wedding, your rules. Enjoy the wedding.", "NTA you need to tell your fiance to stand up to this pressure. The girls are yours, your immediate family and its your wedding so you can decide what to do not anyone else.", "NTA. Do kids really care about being in weddings that much without being hyped by parents? I'm sceptical. Even if they did,there's a huge difference between 'your kids' and your other nieces and nephews and sadly the others have to deal weird that,not you.", "Yeah and that statement should include that if they tell their kids it's because you don't love them then they are just being cruel to their own kids in an attempt to slight you over something that isn't even true and they know it. They are just being dramatic in an attempt to manipulate you.\n\nAnd you should talk to your fiance about not letting others pressure him in to hurting your kids. People pleasers can easily become shitty parents if they start compromising in ways that hurt their kids in their impossible quest to make everyone happy with them all the time."]}
