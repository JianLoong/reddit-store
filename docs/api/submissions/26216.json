Yoiu are paying market rent. The get it when he dies line - that could be decades, and the equity in the house could well be needed for their aged care.

What was your agreement? I'm leaning towards NTA here because I'm guessing you offered to pay for the materials so that he could do the job that he has been wanting to do for 20 years, but you also mention that he could have taken out a loan to pay for the job himself, which would presumably be paid back by increased rent revenue - is he giving you a lower rate compared to the what he could have gotten with other tenants?\n\nMy gut says this is all way too transactional for a familial relationship so you're NTA, but I don't know your circumstances", ">I will be renting it, so I\u2019ll be living there and paying them rent.\n\nThat settles it. HELL NO, you don't need to pay him for his labor. Even paying for the materials for the addition is taking a liberty in my opinion. They own the house, the equity is theirs and they're asking you to subsidize it, and THEN pay for the privilege of living in a house you'll \"get when they die\". \n\nIf one day their fortunes change and they decide to sell the house out from under you, guess what you get?

Labor reimbursement was not mentioned at the start and was not brought up until the addition was under roof. \n\nThe rent part is tricky because he had been renting it out to a lady for about 12 years for $400/month. I\u2019ve agreed to pay 600/m and the addition will bring the house size to around 1,000 square feet. He\u2019s getting more than he was before and not having to foot the bill for material but the rent in both cases is less than market so not sure how to shake out the fairness level on that part.", "I mean I\u2019m not sure what I could be doing for him outside of buying food for him, his wife, and other son that he would otherwise be paying for. I could pay for a football game but that doesn\u2019t seem practical in a helpful kind of way that would equate to what is being done on the house.", "No but I know what I get paid and I know what it costs to live in my area. \n\nTake care ;)", "Like I said, for me this transactional dynamic among family members is not productive under any circumstances, like that's now how familial relationships should work, but I understand that I am not everyone\n\nMy dad always said to me, \"Is it more important to be right, or to preserve the relationship?\" when it came to family. I think you are \"right\" in this scenario, but I also have absolutely no idea how to answer that question for you - sometimes we make concessions for family, but at the same time you need to put your foot down when you are being mistreated. \n\nI'm not going to tell you what you should do because, like I said, I feel like there are probably decades of context here that I don't understand. I do get a sense from this very short interaction with you that you are very thoughtful and will 100% do what's best for you, whatever that decision may be", "That\u2019s the whole point.

Show him how much you appreciate his help.", "Yeah.", "This is probably the most insightful reply I\u2019ve had. Fair enough and thank you for the input. \n\nBe well", "FWIW I did intend to take him to a NFL game soon regardless. However, this seems as if this is presenting the situation as a lop sided agreement or I\u2019m unfairly benefiting. If I had not paid for this then he\u2019s have to take out a loan at, going by current rates, around 7% interest to get the project done. He is helping me but I am also helping him by not charging for him to use my money.", "Well you asked him to do this for you because you didn\u2019t want to wait to inherit. \n\nSounds like he\u2019s losing rent money right now if no one is living in it. \n\nIf you waited until you got it in the will you would have paid a contractor for material & labor.

Trust me.", "NTA but he will screw your over. You\u2019ll see", "NTA, listen up now!!!!! If you are going to be renting the house after the addition is added, you dad will be able to write all the expenses off on his taxes\u2026including the cost of materials.

If he expected to be paid that should have surely brought it up before this happened. You don\u2019t mention it after the fact. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are paying for an addition to a building that he owns. So what if you will be renting, as your dad may live for what? 20, 30 or more years to come? And its possible your dad could sell the house in spite of you living in it. A promise to have it willed to you after death is meaningless until that event happens.\n\nNot knowing your dad's financial status, but if he is doing the work and you are paying for it, Im guessing he isnt loaded. The more time goes by, things could happen that could force your dad to sell. Could even be medical issues as he ages.\n\nGranted, these are worse case scenarios, but fact of the matter is, as your mom said, he could take out a loan to do this if he really wanted. That includes for the materials you are paying for. He still gets all the money for the value of the house if he sells it.\n\nPersonally, I would tell your dad to quit his bitching since you have spent so much on this, and are going to be paying him rent (I hope you already agreed on an amount). I would also somehow tell him that it should be in writing that he will not sell the house that you (and possibly wife and kids) will be living in.", "NTA. You knew he wanted to build the addition for a long time, and you offered to cover the cost of the materials if he let's you rent it from him. That would have been a win-win for the both of you. He didn't have to take a loan, and you would have a place to live with a bellow market rent. At this point, asking you to also pay for the labour, he seems greedy. \n\nI hope he doesn't screw you over when the addition is done.", "Don\u2019t cut him a check unless he adds you to the title or meets with a lawyer to formalize your \u201cinheritance\u201d.

Is it the friends and family rate or top of the market? All this stuff should have been discussed before the first nail was driven. \n\nI have a friend with no money whose Dad who she took into her home and took care of for a year until he passed left his house to her older brother.  He agreed to rent it to her.  It is a bleeping disaster full of termites and roaches and Dad was just shy of a hoarder.  What a bargain!", "I hope all the money you gave him for the house is documented and signed off by him.  Do you have brothers and sisters?  Do they understand and agree to this arrangement?  What happens if he changes his mind and wills the house to someone else?", "I hope that the money used for the addition will be counted toward rent.", "NTA but agree to pay him if and only if he puts you on the deed as co owner now.", "Op....I'm kinda struggling to figure out how y'all spent 20k on materials for an addition with no labor costs....  \n\n\nNo matter, tread very very lightly with this; you shouldn't have signed up for this deal without legal paperwork, and he shouldn't have either.  Paying  that much for the privilege of renting doesn't make a lot of sense.", "Why would you pay rent? Didn\u2019t you just contribute tens of thousands in rent?", "You can put a lien on a house for improvements you paid for and weren't paid back for. As long as she has the receipts for materials, that's all op needs. Car finance companies and credit cards do this all the time to recoup their money. Whether they get their money now or later, the lien has to be paid to the proper holder before proceeds of the sale are paid. If a third party can prove improvements were supplied or performed, they are most definitely entitled to the additional value of the house it provides, with increase of profit from a potential sale years from now.", "Labor is part of the cost of the addition though. Seems like a miscommunication. Why wouldn't he be paying for the labor of he's paying for the addition?", "You're not supposed to get paid back unless it's a loan.  OP said they'd pay for the improvements, not loan their dad funds.  OP has no basis for the lien.", "For the same reason that nobody pays you when you paint a room in your house or upgrade the stereo in your own car. It\u2019s his property. He\u2019s making an addition because HE wants it. He evidently has the skill to do it himself so he didn\u2019t hire out the work. OP certainly doesn\u2019t owe their father money so the father can get equity that doesn\u2019t benefit OP at all except hypothetically. When the addition is done, OP will owe rent. They already when above and beyond paying for the materials.", "Wait, he has another son? So by him leaving  you the house does it mean it\u2019s being left to you and your brother? Also how old are you and how old is your dad?"]}
