This can be as simple as talking about a movie you haven't seen yet and don't want spoiled, to as involved as international politics. \n\nI'm a woman, and with the right group I'm happy to dig in to all the bodily topics, but I would also be uncomfortable talking about free bleeding at a family dinner, not because of just the topic, but because your sister was also trying to convince you to do it too and wouldn't back off. \n\nAnd great, problem solved. You aren't invited the next dinner where you will be bombarded with what you should do with your own body. Your parents and sister can have dinner on their own and in a month when your parents reach out saying how they miss you and you never come around anymore, you can remind them that your sister told you that you weren't invited anymore and they defended her.", "Unless you started yelling, threw down your napkin, and stormed out, you didn't make a scene.  \n\nI imagine you just indicated you were leaving, maybe even said excuse me, gathered your things, maybe paid your part of the bill, and left.

No... not wiping your rear end with toilet paper and frankly, not wiping at all is... natural. Start talking about that at the next dinner. She can hardly complain.", "Ew I wouldn't want to conversate about my bodily functions that are absolutely none of her business at the dinner table either that's gross.

I am a woman and I agree, periods are natural \\[though I disagree entirely with the concept of free bleeding\\], and I don't want to hear about other people's periods, especially at dinner.

Don't threaten me with a good time?", "NTA; you have the right to say \"hey, can we not discuss this bodily function right now?\" and have that respected.
