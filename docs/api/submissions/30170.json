This can be as simple as talking about a movie you haven't seen yet and don't want spoiled, to as involved as international politics. \n\nI'm a woman, and with the right group I'm happy to dig in to all the bodily topics, but I would also be uncomfortable talking about free bleeding at a family dinner, not because of just the topic, but because your sister was also trying to convince you to do it too and wouldn't back off. \n\nAnd great, problem solved. You aren't invited the next dinner where you will be bombarded with what you should do with your own body. Your parents and sister can have dinner on their own and in a month when your parents reach out saying how they miss you and you never come around anymore, you can remind them that your sister told you that you weren't invited anymore and they defended her.", "Unless you started yelling, threw down your napkin, and stormed out, you didn't make a scene.  \n\nI imagine you just indicated you were leaving, maybe even said excuse me, gathered your things, maybe paid your part of the bill, and left.

No... not wiping your rear end with toilet paper and frankly, not wiping at all is... natural. Start talking about that at the next dinner. She can hardly complain.", "Ew I wouldn't want to conversate about my bodily functions that are absolutely none of her business at the dinner table either that's gross.

I am a woman and I agree, periods are natural \\[though I disagree entirely with the concept of free bleeding\\], and I don't want to hear about other people's periods, especially at dinner.

Don't threaten me with a good time?", "NTA; you have the right to say \"hey, can we not discuss this bodily function right now?\" and have that respected.

Where is the line??", "When someone posts a forward slash and an s after a statement, as that poster did, that is internet shorthand for \"this statement is sarcasm.\"", "Would not surprise me a bit, considering that the parents apparently agree with sister that OP overreacted and nowhere in the story does it say that the parents tried to shut it down when she was going on and on about free bleeding.", "It could have been one of those questions like \"is she pregnant?\". Where most people are so stunned that they literally react without thinking. I don't think the fianc\u00e9 did anything wrong. And being on your period is not weird or anything else. \n\nThe sisters reaction however is inappropriate after she has been asked to stop about it. \n\nNTA.", "Are you now vegan ? Lol", "As an anthropologist, historical cannibalism is an interesting topic for me... but definitely not at dinner!", "me too, I was like, you just ignore it while walking in bloodied clothes?", "I saw that post I have no idea how she got so many NTA responses cause you do you in your own spaces but don't take that outside also blood is literally a biohazard and I'd be grossed out by someone free bleeding in public or my spaces. Hell I'd be grossed out being in their spaces while they are free bleeding. I also think she leaked through the towel on the couch, and the towels weren't hers in the 1st place. I think she said she free bleeds because of allergies to pads but like there are so many alternatives out there to pads and tampons, it's not hard to buy some while in other people's places. Free bleeding gives the same vibes as peeing or pooping wherever you are when the urge hits", "That's so disrespectful!", "I just commented about that lol! It was gross.", "What, exactly, is the statement someone like this is trying to make? \"I am inconvenienced therefore everyone else will be, too?\" \"I am woman; watch me bleed?\"", "I couldn't bear to ruin my clothes like that. Great if OPs sister wants that in her own home but I would be so uncomfortable.", "It's definitely to each their own preference for sure. Period underwear are great for those who refuse to use tampons due to the risks, and it functions similar to a pad. Being reusable like a Diva Cup is also a plus for environmentally-minded folks. You change the underwear as often as you need to - definitely shouldn't stay in one pair all day.", "I can\u2019t imagine it not getting on furniture though. And the thought of how uncomfortable and smelly it would be to sit around in blood soaked clothing all day\u2026 to each their own but that\u2019s unsanitary as all hell.", "All i could think is the amount of stuff i have to clean bcos i bleed quite heavily. The stain is so hard ti remove and they smells.", "You can get special period pants...don't know how they work but yeah pretty much.", "Dinner is not the time though and if someone has made it clear they're uncomfortable you stop.", "I agree. Talking openly about these types of things is excellent. Knowing appropriate times for such talks is a basic social function that the typical 2nd grader already knows, *unless* they want attention, are obnoxious, or are atypical.", "I personally wouldn't be bothered by someone talking about their period at the dinner table, not because it's \"natural\", but because I just plain don't find it gross. I think it's interesting and a topic people should be more open about, but like... if someone asked for the conversation to stop I would support that, same as if they asked for a topic change on anything else.", "About bodily fluids and vagina blood. During dinner. At the table.\n\nSo you weren't taught manners...got it.", "In some countries its considered a compliment", "Our parents had a \"no farting, shirts required\" policy at the table because with 3 boys, you just have to.", "Unfortunately I haven\u2019t worked in the \u201ci slipped and fell on this cucumber\u201d department lol. That placenta story be wild though!

I thought that's what the phrase \"injuries incompatible with life\" was for.\n\nSounds awful having to run a code on someone who can't possibly survive.", "Happy cake day!", "No, being on your period is certainly not weird. Having to pee or poop isn\u2019t weird either, these are all perfectly normal bodily functions. It doesn\u2019t have to be weird to be something you consider a private matter, or simply not something you want to discuss while eating. Different people have different sensibilities about that.\n\nAnd I would expect my partner to politely deflect nosy questions like that about me if I have stepped away and he is asked. *Especially* at the dinner table, and especially with someone like OP\u2018s sister, who clearly lacks good sense about the time and place for a given conversation.\n\nBased on her subsequent reaction, it doesn\u2019t seem like \u201cone of those questions\u201d in her case. It seems like she\u2019s the obnoxious type who snoops into people\u2019s bathroom habits. And then pushes others to have conversations at the dinner table about things like period blood and how great it is to free-bleed, probably in order to make the point that being on your period is not weird.", "I was already a vegan, but not a very squeamish one.

Not sorry OP still TA.", "I think that might be burping you are thinking of", "Ah dementia, place of the most insane stories ever! Like when they get an idea in their heads and go with it and then you\u2019re explaining to the attending why the whole ass old person managed to get locked inside the linen cupboard. Because (the 89 year old patient thought) he was stealing his nan\u2019s jam tarts and his grandpa came home from work so he had to hide in the nearest cupboard, obviously! \n\n\nAnd yeah, that placenta was weird! Totally thought it was a strange fish for a bit.", "My mom's friend is a surgical assistant and we had her over for dinner. We were making meatballs, so of course she told us a story of having to re attach someone's Achilles tendon and scrape some of the 'meat' off to make the procedure easier.

The unfortunate side affect of these things no longer grossing *us* out is we forget how bad it sounds to other people.", "No, it was funny and in retrospect I'm very glad I wasn't eating meat.

Used to be a night shift carer. I made him jam tarts the next day, he was very pleased and said \u2018thanks Nana\u2019. Bless", "I don't fault her for it. Some people prefer to only think of their insides as on the inside, and some of us, well yeah it might be gross and creepy, but thankfuly someone is capable and willing to fix it if your insides wind up on your outsides.
