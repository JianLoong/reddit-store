He's just a tad bit irresponsible. He doesn't seem to realise that you need to be extra careful with things you borrow from other people. \n\nLong story short, I let him borrow my car three times. He crashed it. Thrice. I couldn't believe this guy. After that day, I made it very clear that I wouldn't let him borrow my car anymore, especially because he does not care to pay for gas or any other damage, nor does he show remorse or try to be more mindful. He was annoyed but didn't ask to borrow it again. \n\nTwo days ago, Paul called me past midnight and asked to borrow my car. He sounded desperate but I still said no. He then told me that his 14 year old sister (who he was babysitting for the night) broke her ankle and he really needed to get her to the hospital. I hesitated a little bit but still said no. He was almost begging and I felt bad for his sister so I offered to drive them both instead. He refused so fast I flinched. \n\nHe said it's not safe. I asked him why he thought so. Then he said that women are statistically bad drivers and he didn't want to endanger his sister. I was pissed and started ranting about how I was a better driver than him because if he was so good, he wouldn't be crashing my car everytime he borrowed it. We got into a heated argument until he realised his sister was in pain (im assuming). Again, he said to let him borrow it just one last time. He said I could come with them to the hospital and sit in the passenger seat to keep an eye on him. I didn't relent. I said if he wants me drive his sister to the hospital, I'd gladly do it but he's not getting my car again. \n\nHe didn't say anything and just hung up. I called him a cab and went to sleep. Then I woke up to some raging texts from him. Talking about how he didn't expect me to be such a \"selfish asshole\", making his sister sit in the backseat of a \"dingy cab\". I reminded him that the offer to let me drive his sister to the hospital was right there. He refused to take it. \n\nNone of my friends think I'm an asshole but a few of them strongly feel that I should've let Paul borrow my car just one last time considering it was an emergency and that I could've been more flexible.
