We're not super close by any means but I like him and hanging out with him alone is as fun as hanging out with our group of friends. There's one thing about Paul that I absolutely hate. He's just a tad bit irresponsible. He doesn't seem to realise that you need to be extra careful with things you borrow from other people. \n\nLong story short, I let him borrow my car three times. He crashed it. Thrice. I couldn't believe this guy. After that day, I made it very clear that I wouldn't let him borrow my car anymore, especially because he does not care to pay for gas or any other damage, nor does he show remorse or try to be more mindful. He was annoyed but didn't ask to borrow it again. \n\nTwo days ago, Paul called me past midnight and asked to borrow my car. He sounded desperate but I still said no. He then told me that his 14 year old sister (who he was babysitting for the night) broke her ankle and he really needed to get her to the hospital. I hesitated a little bit but still said no. He was almost begging and I felt bad for his sister so I offered to drive them both instead. He refused so fast I flinched. \n\nHe said it's not safe. I asked him why he thought so. Then he said that women are statistically bad drivers and he didn't want to endanger his sister. I was pissed and started ranting about how I was a better driver than him because if he was so good, he wouldn't be crashing my car everytime he borrowed it. We got into a heated argument until he realised his sister was in pain (im assuming). Again, he said to let him borrow it just one last time. He said I could come with them to the hospital and sit in the passenger seat to keep an eye on him. I didn't relent. I said if he wants me drive his sister to the hospital, I'd gladly do it but he's not getting my car again. \n\nHe didn't say anything and just hung up. I called him a cab and went to sleep. Then I woke up to some raging texts from him. Talking about how he didn't expect me to be such a \"selfish asshole\", making his sister sit in the backseat of a \"dingy cab\". I reminded him that the offer to let me drive his sister to the hospital was right there. He refused to take it. \n\nNone of my friends think I'm an asshole but a few of them strongly feel that I should've let Paul borrow my car just one last time considering it was an emergency and that I could've been more flexible. I don't really agree with them but I want to know what you guys think.

But why on earth did you let him borrow your car again after he crashed it even once?", "NTA. Spoiler alert, there was no broken ankle. \n\nI would examine though what made you let him borrow it THRICE THOUGH", "NTA\n\nAnd \"needing money or a vehicle to go to the hospital\" is a common phrase used by addicts who want a fix.  Is there a chance that your buddy is an addict and keeps crashing your car because he drives while high?", "NTA - Your \"friend\" is a liar.", "Hard NTA and you're too good for this world since you let him crash your car thrice. Also you offered to drive his sister to the hospital, which was generous and best friend behaviour in itself.\n\nYour \"friend\" is a major AH though. The audacity to say that men are better drivers after crashing your car three times, is beyond everything.\n\nWith friends like this, you don't need enemies. I would reconsider if this friendship is really worth it.\n\nFor me, that would be a hard pass.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t let him borrow my car either. Remind him he owes you x in damages before he can even request to borrow it again.", "Lol fuck no NTA. Especially after the comment about women being and drivers. Although honestly you are a bit TA to yourself to have left him drive it again after one crash. Fool me once and all .", "Super NTA, calling him a cab was far more than I would have done. That kind of misogyny ever, let alone after wrecking my car, is grounds for a full friendship cut off. He could have called an ambulance or his parents, or accepted your offer to drive. He is just a complete reckless and rude asshole, and I hope you take him to court for the damages to your car.", "NTA, and this guy probably didn\u2019t want the car to drive his sister to the hospital.", "NTA. You gave him a reasonable solution by offering to drive them to the hospital, but he has some weird hangup about female drivers. He's the AH for allowing his sister to suffer over his weirdness. And personally I would have wanted to comfort my sibling if they were in pain, rather than drive. I can't help thinking his driving would have been even worse since his attention would have been on his sister. I wouldn't have loaned him my car at all, at least after the first time he wrecked it. Plus, our friendship would have ended if he didn't pay for the damage. Your friends who thought you should be more flexible this one last time could have loaned him their car. Paul is not a friend.", "NTA.\n\nHe's already shown several times over he can neither be trusted to drive your car safely and responsibly, nor can he be trusted to repair the damage done by his driving.\n\nFirst off he drops a sexist reason for refusing your offer to drive them to the hospital, when statistically he is a terrible driver.\n\nI'll swing a guess he doesn't have his own car because he's probably written off so many that his insurance payments are eye-wateringly high?\n\nThen for the icing on the cake he calls you selfish when you've lent your car three times to him where he hasn't paid you for either fuel or damages... \n\nThis \"friend\" has done nothing but take and is now angry his terrible driving and selfishness have stopped you lending your car to him.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, how many times have you crashed your car? I'm betting it's 0. \n\nHe's crashed your car 3 out of 3 times. He is 100% a worse driver than you. He also should have been paying for the damages.", "Hard NTA. Oh my goodness what kind of \u201cfriend\u201d is that even?", "NTA, and that guy is so rude and lacks self awareness. Also sexist. What a jerk. You offered to help and you were a good friend, you went above and beyond and he still couldn't appreciate it - that someone he called at night offered to help. Your friends who disagree are wrong. Are they brainwashed? He won't even pay for gas??? Lol. No, hold your ground, you did well.", "After the first time he would have never been able to look at my car let alone borrow it a 2nd or 3rd.", "NTA. He\u2019s a hazard on the road and a terrible babysitter too. I don\u2019t believe she really broke her ankle unless I see the cast\u2026 and why didn\u2019t he call his parents?", "NTA letting a friend borrow a car is foolish. He then crashes it and you go on to let him borrow it again and he crashes it. Then you let him borrow it again and he crashes it. What, are you a total doormat? You need therapy to help you enforce boundaries. The reason he is making a real big fuss right now is because he cannot believe you actually stood your ground. So he is going to keep on and on at you until you never stand up to him again. Lose his number.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also im a man but statistically speaking there is a reason that insurance companies charge more to insure young men and it isnt because they are better drivers", "NTA. Nope. He isn't an okay guy, and definitely not your friend. He sounds like an entitled idiot. This should be the sign to cut him out completely. He is upset that you didn't continue to let him use you. Good riddance.", "If he can take her to the ER himself (and spend several minutes arguing about the car) it\u2019s not much of an emergency.

Why give him the car ever again after he crashed it the first time??", "NTA\u2026once, shame on them, twice, shame on you.  But three times?  What exactly were involved in these crashes that you can still drive the car?   How does a 14 year old break their ankle at midnight?  Where were the parents?

And you even called a cab for him. Why?? Don\u2019t be surprised if he does something as stupid and entitled like this again. Go no contact", "If it was an emergency why didn't he call emergency services? NTA; you can't recklessly handle someone else's possessions & still expect to have access to those same possessions. You offered a compromise you were comfortable with, he refused, you ordered him a cab so his sister didn't suffer from his mistakes & he has the gaul to call you an AH? Idk where this notion came from that women are naturally bad drivers; driving skills take practice & the ability to hone in and know their cars.", "NTA. He crashed your car multiple times, and though you don't say how badly, it doesn't really matter because he showed no remorse. Then, when denied a favor but offered a perfectly viable alternative, he shows his broad sexism and personally insults you?

It would be the exact same as borrowing the car, so his behaviour is odd", "NTA fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. But you thought it was ok to let him borrow it a 3rd time? Stand your ground and do not let him anywhere near your car. Don't know why you're so fond of him when he seems incredibly entitled and sexist. Any decent person would feel incredibly guilty crashing someone's car ONCE but he does it 3x and has the audacity to demand your car again?", "NTA.  Block Paul on your phone and social media.  He is a leach not a friend.", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t trust anyone with my car if they so much as scratched my car once, let alone twice, it\u2019s beyond me why OP would even let him borrow the car that third time. Like, what?", "Also- why are you okay being friends with someone who is blatantly sexist OP?", "and refused to pay for the damages!!", "You know what they say\u2026 Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Fool me three times and uh, well I guess that\u2019s you again? Four times though, four times absolutely not, unless\u2026? No, not four times. \n\n\nSeriously though, why is OP even friends with this person? I\u2019ve seen nothing but abhorrent behavior being displayed.

If you let him borrow it this time, he would then just create an emergency every time he wanted to borrow your car. Where were the other friends and their cars to lend out?", "100%", "Personally, if it were me I wouldn\u2019t let him borrow my car even after he paid the damage. I would cite insurance policy and everything just to not let him drive my car.", "I wouldn\u2019t let him borrow it again after he paid damages either just making it an excuse he has to do before even having the ability to ask permission again. Never said the answer would be yes when asked again."]}
