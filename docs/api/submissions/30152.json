I stay out of it mostly, I just let them have their fun and I don't step in unless anything gets unsafe or illegal, or they bother people outside of their group.\n\nMy boyfriend used to have pretty long hair, which I love. I definitely have a thing for guys with long hair and for several of the Halloween parties we went to this week, he went as Tommy Lee in the 80s, one of my celebrity crushes. I thought it was cool.\n\nSo Tuesday night, which was Halloween, I stayed with my friends while my boyfriend went to another Halloween party dressed as Tommy. Had his hair done, makeup, outfit, drumsticks and everything.\n\nI was in his apartment with my friends, he came home and his hair had been shaved off. I don't give a fuck what his hair looks like, as much as I loved his long hair, he looks amazing no matter what. I told him he looked so good, not wanting to make a big deal of it.\n\nYesterday, the day after Halloween, we woke up together and had breakfast and he seemed off. I asked if he was ok, he seemed really down and insecure about his shaved head. I told him how good he looked, but he told me how at the party the night before, his friends called him over to a chair and had clippers plugged in.\n\nHe knew he didn't have to actually do it but he said he felt like a pussy if he didn't go through with it, so he just let them shave his head. They knew he loved his hair. He hated it, but everyone was watching and laughing and recording it. \n\nObviously he got over it but I can tell he's not happy about it. Today I was walking around and happened to see some of his friends. I was going to ignore them but they called me over and told me about shaving my boyfriend's head, I just told them it wasn't cool and he clearly didn't want to do it.\n\nThey told me how he was a pussy for not wanting to do it, so that's why they shaved his head. I told them how fucked it is to make someone do that if they don't want to. I wanted to say more but I just left it at that. They just kept telling me that I was dating a pussy.\n\nApparently they texted my boyfriend to say that I had confronted them, which wasn't true because they were the ones who put me on the spot. He thinks his friends did nothing wrong, even though he hates how he looks now.

So your boyfriend\u2019s friends throw around sexist insults that reinforce toxic masculinity and don\u2019t care about consent.  That\u2019s some real charmers there.\n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend doesn\u2019t know how to stand up for himself, possibly because his shitty friend group doesn\u2019t tolerate when people stand up for themself.  Gotta admit, choosing such a shitty friend group makes me question what kind of a person your boyfriend is.  Birds of a feather\u2026", "NTA. Weird he \u201cthinks they did nothing wrong\u201d but is willing to admit he\u2019s deeply uncomfortable with the results of what they pressured him into. And that he still believes them over you about how that in-person interaction went. He needs better friends.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend was literally peer pressured and was unable to say no to his friends that only wanted to shave his head because they knew he liked his hair.  \n\nThe only way I could see this being a soft YTA is if everyone in the group does this sort of stuff to each other in a impractical jokers sort of thing and they shaved his head cause he lost a bet or something.  But from what you described it sounds like his \u201cfriends\u201d thought this would be extra funny because your boyfriend loved his long hair.", "NTA and they are not his friends, they are abusive bullies.", "NTA.\n\nPeer pressure is a bad thing.", "No I would totally do the same thing.", "He needs better friends. If he doesn't see that, you might need a better boyfriend.\n\nWere you wrong for confonting them? Is it wrong to ask a leopard to change its spots?\n\nThere were obviously assholes here, but you weren't one of them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, those aren't friends.", "Not the same thing at all, but I was at a party once where a girl was pretty drunk (all trusted party-goers) and her gay \u201cbest friend\u201d was trying to get her to come out at the party as lesbian but she wasn\u2019t ready. He kept saying to her \u201cjust tell them, nobody would care. Most of us are gay.\u201d She was very clearly not interested so I had to go over to him and say \u201chey, she\u2019s not ready. It isn\u2019t the time. and that\u2019s fine\u201d\n\nEveryone except for my boyfriend ghosted me afterwards. I got an Instagram DM months later from the girl and she thanked me because she didn\u2019t know what to say with all of the pressuring from her \u201cbest friend\u201d and she was grateful I stepped in and got him to stop.\n\nI wonder what the other party people think of me. They\u2019re probably just straight people who wanted to have a fun lesbian \u201ccoming out\u201d moment. It\u2019s hard to be gay when you\u2019re young. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to accept you. And you definitely don\u2019t expect your best friend to out you at a party while you\u2019re drunk.\n\nEdit to add: like when I was thirteen, I went to a holiday party with my boyfriend at the time and we held hands, and the host\u2019s father sent her a text saying \u201cwhy are those two boys holding hands?\u201d He knew why but\u2026 yeah", "NTA & those aren\u2019t friends.
