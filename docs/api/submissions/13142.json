So yesterday it was nearing 5pm and everyone had already gotten their stuff outside so we could lock up and go home as soon as the kids were all picked up. One kid (4m) wanted to know what time it was and my coworker (40f) asked me if I had a clock on me.\n\nI was busy with cleaning up at the moment so I just handed her my phone without really thinking about it. Note that my phone is usually locked away in the office all day because I broke two phones already at this daycare (children are sweet but they're also lunatics) so there's no way for the kids to just take it and turn it on by themselves.\n\nNow. Those of you who are on tumblr (and maybe even those of you who aren't) may have heard of Gandalf Big Naturals. If you haven't, you might still be able to figure out what that might look like, but in case you don't here's my lockscreen: https://images.app.goo.gl/bZi1qnx4xkpEGv6f8\n\nApparently my coworker held the phone in a way where the kid could see it and of course he thought it was extremely funny. Two of my other coworkers thought it was funny too and one didn't think much of it but the coworker I handed my phone was really pissed at me for having this inappropriate lockscreen. \n\nI told this story to my mom and she called me unprofessional but like- that's my own private cellphone the kids normally never get to see?? How do you even have to hold the phone as a grown adult for a 4yo to see the screen?? Idk I'm not even sure anymore, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679739268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121hgn7/aita_for_having_an_inappropriate_lock_screen/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just to keep the peace, maybe consider a less big, less natural lockscreen and save Gandalf for wallpaper?", "I don't think you're an arsehole exactly, but I think you need to be more careful with putting yourself in a position you can be accused of being unprofessional. Like if a parent had seen that picture, you might end up with a whole lot of explaining and possibly reprimanded. If the kid who saw it goes home and tells their parents, yeah. You're just putting yourself in a sticky situation. \n\nI work with kids (though they are older and in the UK) and we have done so much training about professional use of technology. Some of it is about keeping the kids safe, and some of it is about protecting yourself. It is a funny picture, it's probably not appropriate for your lock screen if there is a risk of the kids seeing it.\n\nSo I think arsehole is the wrong word but I guess YTA.", "NAH. I get your side and I get their side. From a professional standpoint it could put your employer in a bad spot if someone decided to take issue with it. Tbh just to avoid problems I\u2019d change it.", "Thank you for giving me my new lockscreen lol", "Retired principal here. If your phone can be seen by kids, change the lock screen. That image is inappropriate for littles. Based on the incident you described, it can be seen by littles, so change your image. Gentle YTA cuz it\u2019s a funny image!", "Look, it\u2019s your right to have whatever picture you want as your lock screen. You can do whatever you want to do. Keep it, change it, whatever. As long as you\u2019re prepared for the possibility that you could lose your job over this if a kid or parent somehow sees it, or your coworker complains to management about it - do what you want. If that were to happen, be prepared to accept that consequences of your decision and move on.", "NAH, you should be free to have it as long as no one can see it. However, clearly, it's possible for someone to see. Just make it your wallpaper and make the lock screen something more innocent. Mine is Hello Kitty, because I know kids get into things you don't expect them to. The other day, I had to use my phone to time an activity, so it came out of my locker. I was really glad it was something appropriate!", "YTA pick your battles. Change the picture", "YTA. We live in a society. Ir may be unfortunate, but people's opinions matter. And while you're well within your rights and not wrong, someone's negative reaction to something meaningless and insignificant could affect your employment. \n\nThe lock screen is adolescent and would be seen as misogynistic if you were male.  It's a lock screen, not a platform to declare your inner self to the world. But  it is not as private as we think.and the world judges harshly.  You thought a child wouldn't see it. One did. Is it worth it?\n\nAn adolescent would fight for their right to display big boobs ironically.  An adult would not have the image. I've seen young professionals who present wonderfully until their cell phone rings and crude and suggestive lyrics invade you space. Think sitting in a high-level business meeting and \"I like big butts!\"  suddenly fills the room. It changes how we see the person.  \n\nTime to grow up.  Your lock screen is an off-color joke. In today's world, it could get you fired. Just change it.", "I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re an asshole. But pick and choose your battles. When you\u2019re at work, you need to be somewhat professional. I work in a brutally hot factory full of the lowest forms of life, alcoholics, and mentally ill. That lock screen would be tame compared to most other\u2019s here. \n\nHowever, you work in a daycare. If a parent sees it, you could be fired. This is a society where yesterday a principal had to resign because kids at a school were shown the \u201cDavid\u201d statue. Is this a fight worth fighting?", "YTA.\n\nThat's unprofessional, and would put your employer in a difficult position if a parent saw it and complained or if your child saw it and told their parents and the parents complained.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's SO unimportant to you and can cause serious problems for you given your profession.", "YTA not appropriate. If it was a regular picture of Gandalf then fine, but this one is not professional. Just suck it up and change it.", "If everything you say is true (phone is normally locked up) then you\u2019re NTA, not even remotely.  Actually, scratch that, you\u2019re NTA regardless of where the phone is kept.", "NTA. But I would definitely not let any parents see it. Maybe instead it that picture being your lock screen, change it to the home screen. Would be a shame for this to become something serious.", "NTA it's your personal phone and hahahaha I laughed out loud", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal.", "NTA\nYour coworker held the phone so the kids could see. But if you're in the US, in the current climate I would g free very careful.", "YTA.  You work with kids, you carry your phone on you.  Kids are wiley buggers. Chances are one of them is going to get ahold of your phone at some point and see your lock screen.    You really need to keep your lock screen kid safe.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
