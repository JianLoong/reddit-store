So yesterday it was nearing 5pm and everyone had already gotten their stuff outside so we could lock up and go home as soon as the kids were all picked up. One kid (4m) wanted to know what time it was and my coworker (40f) asked me if I had a clock on me.\n\nI was busy with cleaning up at the moment so I just handed her my phone without really thinking about it. Note that my phone is usually locked away in the office all day because I broke two phones already at this daycare (children are sweet but they're also lunatics) so there's no way for the kids to just take it and turn it on by themselves.\n\nNow. Those of you who are on tumblr (and maybe even those of you who aren't) may have heard of Gandalf Big Naturals. If you haven't, you might still be able to figure out what that might look like, but in case you don't here's my lockscreen: https://images.app.goo.gl/bZi1qnx4xkpEGv6f8\n\nApparently my coworker held the phone in a way where the kid could see it and of course he thought it was extremely funny. Two of my other coworkers thought it was funny too and one didn't think much of it but the coworker I handed my phone was really pissed at me for having this inappropriate lockscreen. \n\nI told this story to my mom and she called me unprofessional but like- that's my own private cellphone the kids normally never get to see?? How do you even have to hold the phone as a grown adult for a 4yo to see the screen?? Idk I'm not even sure anymore, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679739268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121hgn7/aita_for_having_an_inappropriate_lock_screen/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just to keep the peace, maybe consider a less big, less natural lockscreen and save Gandalf for wallpaper?", "I don't think you're an arsehole exactly, but I think you need to be more careful with putting yourself in a position you can be accused of being unprofessional. Like if a parent had seen that picture, you might end up with a whole lot of explaining and possibly reprimanded. If the kid who saw it goes home and tells their parents, yeah. You're just putting yourself in a sticky situation. \n\nI work with kids (though they are older and in the UK) and we have done so much training about professional use of technology. Some of it is about keeping the kids safe, and some of it is about protecting yourself. It is a funny picture, it's probably not appropriate for your lock screen if there is a risk of the kids seeing it.\n\nSo I think arsehole is the wrong word but I guess YTA.", "NAH. I get your side and I get their side. From a professional standpoint it could put your employer in a bad spot if someone decided to take issue with it. Tbh just to avoid problems I\u2019d change it.", "Thank you for giving me my new lockscreen lol", "Retired principal here. If your phone can be seen by kids, change the lock screen. That image is inappropriate for littles. Based on the incident you described, it can be seen by littles, so change your image. Gentle YTA cuz it\u2019s a funny image!", "Look, it\u2019s your right to have whatever picture you want as your lock screen. You can do whatever you want to do. Keep it, change it, whatever. As long as you\u2019re prepared for the possibility that you could lose your job over this if a kid or parent somehow sees it, or your coworker complains to management about it - do what you want. If that were to happen, be prepared to accept that consequences of your decision and move on.", "NAH, you should be free to have it as long as no one can see it. However, clearly, it's possible for someone to see. Just make it your wallpaper and make the lock screen something more innocent. Mine is Hello Kitty, because I know kids get into things you don't expect them to. The other day, I had to use my phone to time an activity, so it came out of my locker. I was really glad it was something appropriate!", "YTA pick your battles. Change the picture", "YTA. We live in a society. Ir may be unfortunate, but people's opinions matter. And while you're well within your rights and not wrong, someone's negative reaction to something meaningless and insignificant could affect your employment. \n\nThe lock screen is adolescent and would be seen as misogynistic if you were male.  It's a lock screen, not a platform to declare your inner self to the world. But  it is not as private as we think.and the world judges harshly.  You thought a child wouldn't see it. One did. Is it worth it?\n\nAn adolescent would fight for their right to display big boobs ironically.  An adult would not have the image. I've seen young professionals who present wonderfully until their cell phone rings and crude and suggestive lyrics invade you space. Think sitting in a high-level business meeting and \"I like big butts!\"  suddenly fills the room. It changes how we see the person.  \n\nTime to grow up.  Your lock screen is an off-color joke. In today's world, it could get you fired. Just change it.", "I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re an asshole. But pick and choose your battles. When you\u2019re at work, you need to be somewhat professional. I work in a brutally hot factory full of the lowest forms of life, alcoholics, and mentally ill. That lock screen would be tame compared to most other\u2019s here. \n\nHowever, you work in a daycare. If a parent sees it, you could be fired. This is a society where yesterday a principal had to resign because kids at a school were shown the \u201cDavid\u201d statue. Is this a fight worth fighting?", "YTA.\n\nThat's unprofessional, and would put your employer in a difficult position if a parent saw it and complained or if your child saw it and told their parents and the parents complained.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's SO unimportant to you and can cause serious problems for you given your profession.", "YTA not appropriate. If it was a regular picture of Gandalf then fine, but this one is not professional. Just suck it up and change it.", "If everything you say is true (phone is normally locked up) then you\u2019re NTA, not even remotely.  Actually, scratch that, you\u2019re NTA regardless of where the phone is kept.", "NTA. But I would definitely not let any parents see it. Maybe instead it that picture being your lock screen, change it to the home screen. Would be a shame for this to become something serious.", "NTA it's your personal phone and hahahaha I laughed out loud", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal.", "NTA\nYour coworker held the phone so the kids could see. But if you're in the US, in the current climate I would g free very careful.", "YTA.  You work with kids, you carry your phone on you.  Kids are wiley buggers. Chances are one of them is going to get ahold of your phone at some point and see your lock screen.

I was not aware of Gandalf Big Naturals, but I am now blessed with this thanks to you. Cannot for the life of me understand the Y T A votes. Just continue to keep your phone locked out of the reach of kids and don\u2019t hand it to coworkers in the future! That one coworker of yours needs to find a sense of humour.", "NTA worker that let the 4 year old see your phone is the asshole", "YTA because you brought your phone with an inappropriate image into a professional setting to be used. \nIt\u2019s fine to have that screen in your personal life - but the moment you used it during work hours and handed it to a coworker you made it part of your professional life.", "YTA you say no one will see it, but literally a coworker saw it. For your own safety and job security, change it.", "NAH I don't think it's an inappropriate image in and of itself - there's no nudity or sexuality involved. But it's not appropriate *for the daycare* only because some parents (or in this case coworker) will get all butthurt about it. Anyone who does is the actual AH but if it can affect your employment then it's better to keep that as your wallpaper and choose an innocuous lockscreen. Sometimes being professional means having to present ourselves and our possessions in ways that are more generally acceptable to others and not what we personally prefer.", "NTA but it seems like you're taking a risk for not much benefit. \n\nA colleague of mine got fired based on his personal phone contents, 'worse' than yours but then we don't work around kids so the expected standard would not be the same.\n\nI guess you should know your own workplace better than us. It is a company/manager likely to be up tight or with a sense of humour?\nYou could ask your boss/manager their opinion, but then if they say you should change it and you don't want to then it is an awkward situation.", "NAH. I mean, I can get why your coworker was upset because what if a parent got pissed and tried to rake them over the coals for showing their kid something inappropriate? However. Personally I don't think that it's that big of a deal, I'm sure the kid has seen someone with breasts on TV before. If you're worried about getting in trouble though, maybe change it to your home screen instead of your lock screen to protect your own butt. Also, you have good taste in memes.", "NTA. You see similar things watching Modern Family which is considered a family show. People walk down the street wearing revealing clothes. They're covered boobs and on your personal phone that the kids don't use or really see. Wether they catch a glimpse of somewhat covered titties while an adult is checking the time or they go to the beach it's just normal and going to happen. \n\nIf you brought this kind of stuff around the kids directly with intent of showing them such things then that'd be concerning but you didn't. \n\nI would say that since you are working with kids, just to avoid and issues, keep it G rated if it's something that could ever possibly cross their line of vision.", "YTA you handed your phone to your coworker when there were children around so you can\u2019t really say kids don\u2019t get to see your phone.", "It\u2019s a funny lock screen but yeah, YTA. As a guy who worked in primary schools as a TA, we have to be so goddamn careful around the kids. Sure, a kid might not see your phone screen but as your post has demonstrated, it isn\u2019t impossible. And if a teacher or parent saw it, which is far more likely, you\u2019d definitely get into shit for it. Set it to your home screen or something", "YTA. Get a clock for work and keep your personal mobile just that - personal.", "NTA\u2026.. they are BOOBS. If they don\u2019t want to see cleavage don\u2019t go in public!", "YTA.  We're all nasty hilarious perverts with amazing senses of humor.\n\nHave the illusion of professionalism.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith that said, I had to call the police, and I was showing cop via pictures of the vandalism, and I swiped to some Berserk man titties.  They cast a beautiful shadow on Griffiths face.  I think he might have been staring up at them drooling.  There were sparkles.   I wear suits to work... and I swiped to some man titties.   Again, we all have excellent taste here on reddit.", "\"'that's my own private cellphone the kids normally never get to see??\"\n\nBut they DID see it. In the grand scheme of things it's no big deal, but still... YTA.", "Soft YTA here for putting your coworker in that position. It's not a huge deal, but it *is* unprofessional. Your mom is totally right. It doesn't matter if it's your private phone or not, it's still unprofessional if it's something that can be seen or heard at the workplace. It just shows a level of immaturity on your part, tbh. Even if something isn't intended to be seen by someone else, it can still be unprofessional. For instance, I can have whatever password I want for my account on my work computer, but if I have to tell IT one day that my password is ILikeBigTits420, well that would be pretty unprofessional.\n\nVery soft yta because it wasn't anything super inappropriate, it could have been a lot worse. But it's still unprofessional.", "Struggling with the \u201cit\u2019s inappropriate\u201d comments here. Like\u2026 is it though???? If it was a woman with big breasts covered by clothing (zero nudity!!!) would you be reacting the same way? Or, say, a shirtless pic of OP\u2019s husband on the beach? Why is this particular pic somehow seen as unprofessional?\n\nNAH is my vote because I CAN imagine a parent going insane over this if they heard about it, so OP should protect themselves and change it I guess, but god\u2026 some people - including those of you commenting here - are ridiculously uptight. There\u2019s nothing sexual or inappropriate about that image. It\u2019s just a man with fully clothed boobs.", "NTA because you weren't the idiot showing the gandalf boobie screen to children.", "NAH, but honestly it is unprofessional to have as a lock screen and you should probably change it for some CYA insurance. You don't always keep it locked away as this story clearly demonstrates, so you need to be aware that people may see it and take issue with it. It would be very easy for that kid to relay the picture to their parents, who may take issue with it and them cause issues for you.\n\nI presume this wouldn't be your lock screen if it was just a regular person showing off those naturals, and I'd be willing to bet that 'inappropriate and awkward' would be someone of the justifications why.", "NTA.  But you are a dumbass.", "NTA! So silly, it's your personal phone not a company phone. Also nothing wrong with the picture! Its not nudity or just raw genitalia, it's cleavage..\nEdit: what happens to kids when they are on the beach with all that cleavage? Do parents go around to one another stating they're dressed inappropriate in front of the kids?", "YTA. I would be upset as a parent if I knew my child was being exposed to inappropriate content at daycare. Working with children requires an extra level of professionalism and discretion that\u2019s just part of the job.", "wait caude were going to ignore the phone is usually locked in the office? NTA tell your coworker to get a watch", "YTA simply cause kids don\u2019t know how to shut up. Imagine a kid coming home saying \u201cI saw a wizard with big boobies today!\u201d Then a mom says \u201cYou saw WHAT?\u201d Now you lost your job over \u201cnothing\u201d if it\u2019s not that important just change it. I don\u2019t think big titty Gandalf is worth your job.", "NAH but you might rethink your potentially \u201cexposed\u201d stuff when in public. \n\nMy mailman was delivering packages and his ringtone started blaring with \u201cI like big butts\u201d. It was his special ring for his wife. At work another coworkers ringtone blared \u201cA B C D E FU and your\u2026..\u201d In a board meeting with the board of directors. \n\nWhile these are funny, and yes I laughed at both, maybe rethink your choices in a workplace setting.", "YTA. For your profession that is extremely unprofessional and inappropriate to have. You work with children and you need to grow up.", "Why didn't you just look at the screen yourself also NTA OR TAH I think this is just a bit of a dumb move by giving the phone to someone else also why did you have your phone out infront of the children that's unprofessional.", "This is the answer \n\nHave this image as wallpaper and have the unedited image as screensaver\n\nThen every time you unlock your phone gandalf flashes you them big naturals!", "Look, it\u2019s your right to have whatever picture you want as your lock screen.", "I have to agree with you on this. Everyone has a right to have whatever lock screen they want.  However, just like we have to dress appropriately and watch our language at work, things like lock screens should also be kept professional if there's a chance someone else might see it, especially young children."]}
