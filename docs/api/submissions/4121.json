It is 100% child abuse to confuse a child on the intentions of a parent and to undermine the child's understanding of love from said parent. It leads to a feeling of instability in the child by making the child question your motives any time you do something child does not like because MIL says you are being harsh and messing the kids up.

If so, mommy is working on him the whole time and he is never going to have your back.", "NTA \n\nSend your husband this thread. \n\nHe better smarten up or you can fight for custody and when it all goes down in court as to what\u2019s what, your MIL may not be allowed near the kids or he could just have supervised visitation rights if he is letting the kids call her mama, letting her disrespect you and undermine you. \n\nStand firm and strong Op! Also, if you have any txts or evidence regarding your MIL keep all and screenshot and save.", "NTA I'm so glad you stood up for yourself and won't take being treated as a breeding machine for kids his mom can raise. I hope you'll be divorced and free of him soon. I'm sure he and mommy will be very happy together.", "Agreed, allowing him equally shared visitation is very reasonable. And good practice in the event they get divorced! She could have easily told him to GTFO and stay with his mother full time if he wants to defend her so badly and just visit the kids in the evening lol. OP is far less petty than me.", "Thank you. For character limits, I had to edit out the part where I had originally written that I partially blame myself for not setting a boundary sooner.", "If left alone with kids (or supervised by the husband only) the MIL will likely make it her mission to wreak havoc on their upbringing...", "completely agree. if my mil acted like this we would never go over with our daughter. i\u2019m sorry that you couldn\u2019t have known sooner but i would get tf out of there asap. hard and long process but so worth it down the road. find someone who respects you and will stand up for you.", "Eye roll. \n\nMaking your spouse homeless because he doesn\u2019t fully agree with you is abusive behavior.

But practically, it\u2019s both of ours. Because of character limits I couldn\u2019t fully flesh out that part.

It had two toys in it, one a stereotypical \u201cboy\u201d toy and one a stereotypical \u201cgirl\u201d toy. The gift was for both of the kids to share. The friend made that clear, and we\u2019re on the same page about not forcing gendered toys. SB wanted the \u201cboy\u201d toy and said it obviously wasn\u2019t for his sister. I told him no, that friend gave both toys to both of them to share. MIL told him that obviously the \u201cboy\u201d toy was for him and the \u201cgirl\u201d toy for FB, and she would make sure FB didn\u2019t play with \u201chis\u201d toy. \n\nThe rules are stupid, everyday rules, like put your toys away, don\u2019t hit, don\u2019t take things from each other, brush your teeth, etc. Nothing remotely controversial.", "He refused marriage counseling.

Apologizing to your mommy for your wife rightfully calling out her shitty and DANGEROUS behavior (children should never be taught to ignore their own parents ffs) is also not a thing a mature married person would do. Husband played a stupid game and got his stupid prize. OP, NTA.", "What is marriage counseling going to do? He thinks she is overreacting and his mother did no wrong. People like that don\u2019t have epiphanies in marriage counseling they either refuse to go or refuse to do the work.

Everything OP has said is completely normal for a parent to do. You don't let a kid take a toy from another, you don't refuse to give a child back to its mother, and you don't let the kids fight and then tell the kids to disregard their mother.", "I had the same thought.  We are getting one side of a biased story.  Something fishy is going on here.", "Marriage was already ruined.", "She isn\u2019t the problem it is her spineless husband and horrible mil that caused this. If he wants to be her husband he needs to support her instead of being a mama\u2019s boys. It is her home. Why should she be forced to spend time with a man who doesn\u2019t value her?", "So you would be okay with your MIL coming into your house and overruling what you told the kids to do and your husband standing there saying nothing? Your right he shouldn\u2019t have to choose he should recognize where that line is already. Nobody is saying that he can\u2019t have a relationship with both his mom and OP, but he needs to stand up for his wife when his mom is treating her unfairly.", "100% I would choose my husband over my mother. I don\u2019t have kids yet but we have talked about them and are making sure we are on the same page for future parenting decisions. I recognize my mother has boundary issues and it is quite possible she will cross a line we have set. If it comes to the well-being of my family (my husband and children - just because you are related to someone doesn\u2019t entitle them to be family) I have already accepted the fact I might need to be firm and hold her accountable and eventually cut contact if she is unable to respect the decisions my husband and I have made together. His mother (my MIL) on the other hand is a saint and I have seen how she treats her other DIL with kids and I fully trust she will be able to abide by our requests.", "Sounds to me that he's happier living with mommy, compared to having an a healthy adult relationship with his wife.", "Making peace with his mother but not his wife? I don't see him apologizing to his wife about his mother's behavior.", ">She could have easily told him to GTFO and stay with his mother full time if he wants to defend her so badly\n\nThat opens it up to more exposure of their kids to his mother. OP is absolutely taking the right action by finally drawing a line. This will, almost certainly, lead to divorce if husband is still advocating for OP to just apologize to his mother, but OP needs to do what is best for her kids and herself.", "It\u2019s time to get consults with a few divorce lawyers and line up your ducks. Get copies of all financial paperwork - account balances, credit cards, mortgage, property, last 5 years tax return, and also copies of birth certificates/social security cards", "It\u2019s not too late. Good luck!", "Let her try. Many grandparents love to judge and meddle because they know they won\u2019t be dealing with it full time. I had one like that.

He didn\u2019t tell her she was wrong, he just made peace with his mom. OP can just not talk or go visit MIL, but instead she needs her husband to fight with his mom. For what?", "In both cases your husband shows little to zero spine.", "I completely agree with all of that, I just thinking kicking him out of his home that he also paid for isn\u2019t the best move. And unless she intends to get a divorce, which would be valid but she doesn\u2019t say that that\u2019s her goal, a bit of professional help would be a good idea. Frankly even if she did want the divorce it could be for the sake of settling things", "It seems quite obvious that he doesn\u2019t believe his wife was in the wrong though. She didn\u2019t write out the entire conversation but I bet it\u2019s likely he said he doesn\u2019t think his mother is in the right. He didn\u2019t want to tell OP he was apologizing to his mom so apparently he isn\u2019t proud of it. I believe he just did it because he was trying to make peace with his mom.\n\nYes he should have backed up his wife instead. Yes his mom is out of control. The only point I am making is for a first major fight, OP escalated the issue quite quickly. Getting your SO to stand up to their parents isn\u2019t just a switch to flip. It needs to be approached correctly. This is not stable normal human behavior, and OP admits to being red when she had this fight.", "That\u2019s why I said he can visit the kids in the evenings, in the family home. Not his mother\u2019s house. I agree the kids should not have any more exposure to their grandmother.", "Same here, though it was before they got engaged. She messaged me and asked for the details of our divorce, why I left, what happened. I told her that and about the research I'd done as part of my healing and understanding process. They were on the verge of breaking up and my ex texted me to thank me for talking with his girlfriend. The next day, he told his mom that they were staying together and that she needed to butt out, to which she responded, \"It's her or me.\" I told him if he didn't stop letting her control his life that he would end up alone. My exMIL moved away, but it sounds like she's still up to trying to control him, only now it's that she won't recognize his marriage or his wife. \n\nOP, you are NTA and I tell you with my whole heart that he will never change because he doesn't see a reason to. Get out now and show your kids that they shouldn't treat other people this way nor should they let other people treat them that way.", "You're right she should have sent him back to his mommy.

Why should she have to continue to suffer from her husbands neglect just because he is the husband?", "It sounds like been trying to get her husband to stand up to his mom for five years. After taking so much it boils over.", "Where is it obvious? Him saying \"I've always supported you\"? While apologizing to MIL about his wife's behavior?

Half way divorcing him because he didn\u2019t want to fight with his mom is lunacy. This is the first time a fight like this has occurred, OP has not tried something easier like cutting MIL out from herself first. OPs husband did not say OP was wrong. OP has some serious problems herself taking it from 0 to 100 like this.", "Based on what she\u2019s saying I do hope that\u2019s where it\u2019s going! And yeah, the fact that he\u2019s still spending lots of time at home and with the kids makes it pretty reasonable. I guess that if I were her and I did still want to preserve the marriage for whatever reason I\u2019d go with not speaking to him and having him sleep on the couch rather than fully kicking him out, but if splitting is the next step anyway then why not. Either way NTA may have been a better response truthfully, I can admit when I\u2019m wrong lol", "It sounds like she has been trying very half heartedly for years. It sounds like he thinks it\u2019s a mild inconvenience and OP has been boiling. So OP thinks she has given him plenty of warning but he probably didn\u2019t even know there was really a fire and suddenly she is blowing up on him.

I might agree she overreacted if it was simply her unloading on him for this instead of discussing next steps, but he actively and covertly apologized for her behavior like his wife was completely in the wrong and MIL was an innocent in this encounter. \n\nHe could have tried so many different ways to apologize to his mom, but he went to sorry my wife was such a bitch. paraphrasing of course no idea what was actually said, but that seems to be the subtext of his convo with his mom. He could have said \u201cI am sorry that that disagreement got so out of hand, but she was right you really need to help us display a united front with the kids. Discipline is our job. Please support us in this.\u201d", ">After a lot of back and forth & pulling teeth, Husband explained that he was texting MIL to apologize for the way things went down.\n\n\nSo he didn't text his mom to apologize?", "My mom is dead so no issues here. Good assumption though", "Indeed I\u2019m sure MILs have ruined many relationships. Indeed this could be the inevitable outcome for this relationship. But there isn\u2019t indication here that all options have been explored. They went from \u201cMIL is an inconvenience\u201d straight to \u201cchoose me over MIL or we are getting divorced\u201d. \n\nNothing about this story or reaction sounds healthy. A more tempered response would be \u201cyour mother is not allowed at our house, and I\u2019m not going to visit her until she apologizes and promises not to undermine me in front of the kids\u201d\n\nWhich maybe is how the conversation went down, it\u2019s just not how it\u2019s portrayed to me.", "Lol my wife and mom have gotten in fights and I take my wife\u2019s side.

Maybe you and OP are perfect for each other.", "For sure husband is in the wrong from the story we are given.\n\nBut the way I read this story is wife has been complaining that MIL is a nuisance but now she has shifted to wanting decisive action right this second. Obviously husband has issues standing up to his mother and asking him to flip a switch isn\u2019t reasonable. There are much more compromising ways to push your SO into action. A great first step would be to say \u201cMIL isn\u2019t allowed to come over anymore until she apologizes and promises not to undermine me in front of the kids\u201d. This forces husbands hand but also gives time to ease into it.  Maybe OP did this, it\u2019s just not how she portrays it in my opinion.", "I though you were saying he texted his mom that he \u201calways supported her\u201d in regards to this fight.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what he texted his mom, I imagine some bullshit in an attempt to calm her down.", "[removed]", "It's been happening for 5yrs since they had their first child.

It's asking if OP went too far and if she is the asshole.

To me it looks like poor communication. Husband is probably blindsided to find out OP is on the cusp of divorce over what he thought was a trifling matter.\n\nYea husband should have been supportive and nipped this much earlier I agree, but communication surely failed in both directions. \n\nOP could have had a blow up a step below divorce threats as her first major battle over this.", "I never said he needed an explanation for why his mother was being inappropriate, again you are arguing with a straw man. I know reading comprehension is hard", "Well, that sounds like an even bigger problem if he feels that sticking up for his wife while his mother is wanting to call herself mama to his children and her undermining his wife's parenting choices as an inconvenience."]}
