Otherwise it ends up where you finally snap, and you end up feeling worse than if you had started at a smaller issue. People who use you will continue to until you stop them.

You could keep paying for her, but that\u2019s not helping her. She\u2019s burned all her bridges. You\u2019re not required to set yourself on fire to keep her warm. She has to want help. It sucks to know people like this. It can be hard to accept that you need to step away from them. But it\u2019s important for yourself and your own circle of friends and family not to exhaust and frustrate yourself into a mess.", "You don't have anything other than money to help her. And if you don't have that, she will be gone. OP please grow a spine, you don't need to help a leech.", "\n\nTrue enough. Op didn't tell them not to order the most expensive item. They just passive aggressively snapped at them as soon as they did it.   Was ordering the most expensive thing rude. Yes it was.  Was passive aggressively snapping at them when op didn't tell them  beforehand they couldn't do it also rude.   Yes it was.  Like I say op comes off  here as very controlling and more bothered about the fact that they spent their money on these things than that the friend actually did them. I suspect the reason for this  is that  the friend was Intoxicated and  being annoying  followed by acting belligerent at getting repeatedly told off. And that op who was still driving for a vast amount of these interactions was mostly sober and annoyed at the behaviour and was very short with her Which is why I asked about that specifically.   \n\nI suspect that throughout the day the friend got more and more drunk. Op got more and more annoyed that they were funding this but not drinking themselves and at the drunken behaviour and by the time evening rolled round the friend was in a state  not really conductive to listening to reason.  Hence the sharing of bottles conversation.  The already annoyed and still mostly sober op. Was annoyed that it is their wine that they paid for and they are being ignored by the much drunker friend who has already previously annoyed them with their drunken behaviour in the restaurant the lounge and in the car.That op Has had enough and leaves them in the hotel to go out alone.  When they return drunk friend has locked them out and won't let them in because they are now belligerently drunk and angry.\n \n\nThings that sound like drunken behaviour include \n\nRepeatedly drinking from the bottles. -rude but no worse than most drunk people \n\nEating in the car despite being told not to - rude but no worse than most drunk people.\n\nLoudly and suddenly wanting to leave the lounge. \n\nBeing left in the hotel room while op goes out in her own with other friends. \n\nLocking the door and refusing to come open it. \n\nSee if this is the case then op threw a drunk woman who wasn't in complete control of herself  out into the street with  no money and no real viable way home.rather than go out and just leave them to sleep it off.   And that is    bad behaviour  by anyone's standards.    \n\nI'm not saying the friend was in the right just that none of them are.", "[removed]", "Thank you. This time around the door is closed for good.  Despite how long it took to really set the boundary, I\u2019m proud of myself for doing it. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working hard to implement with everyone. I\u2019ve learned the tools now standing firm on them and using them is new and despite the mixed emotions I have your comment and several others have me feeling proud of myself and no longer like I did something wrong. \n\nI know this may be simple for everyone else but it\u2019s something that took me years to accomplish. \n\nAlso the only reason why I\u2019ve been holding on to her is because of how she and her family has always welcomed me and took me in. It was my first time ever getting close to someone or there family and I used to cry so much in private behind how they made me feel like family and loved (it was never genuine but it felt like it). She\u2019s not all bad but the bad out ways the good and I can\u2019t take it anymore. I recently found the love and desire to feel like I was wanted/needed in God and myself last year and I feel that\u2019s what helped out a lot. I no longer need to look for it in others when I found it in God and me (I know many don\u2019t care to hear religion mentioned but it\u2019s honestly what helped me).\n\nThank you and others for the responses to this post.", "She has an iPhone with no service she can\u2019t afford to pay the bill, she can only use the phone on wifi.", ">As someone with mental health issues I don't appreciate being lumped in with everyone acting like they're the main character of the universe to the detriment of those around them. \n\nWhy would you assume that you would lumped in with her? Mental illness can manifest differently in different people, anyone worth associating with no this and would not allow anyone else's behavior reflect on you. You are responsible for your behavior and yours alone, please do not worry about others behavior. Because again anyone that will stigmatize you for others behavior is not worth knowing anyways. All the best to you, and I hope that you get past any issues you may be having.", "It still doesn\u2019t read as controlling to me. Snapping at her for ordering the most expensive item isn\u2019t necessarily passive-aggressive. It\u2019s not stated what OP said, could have actually been pretty mild, seeing as how he let her get away with so much, but even to that, when she would have likely been more sober, she acted entitled to his money. \n\nHer being drunk is NOT an excuse for being an AH. Plenty of people don\u2019t do AH moves when drunk any more than when sober. And based on the OP\u2019s other comments, she\u2019s pushed his buttons from the get-go, and if she was drunk all the time, well, mystery solved as to why she has no job and no friends. \n\nAlso, this was the OP\u2019s birthday. On any other day, maybe I would say some of this is controlling. Not all, but maybe some. But on your birthday, people are supposed to be celebrating YOU, not getting drunk off their asses and making you be the DD and drinking your booze from the bottle and spilling food in your car. \n\nAs for him throwing her out? It wasn\u2019t him that forced her to drink. It wasn\u2019t him that ignored his requests, was rude to strangers, and locked him out of his own room. She made the choices that got her where she was. Blaming him for kicking her out feels very codependent to me. Drunk adults are still adults who are expected to know right from wrong.", "I think it's really great you found your self worth.\n\nI'm not really religious, but my dad is a progressive Christian pastor.
