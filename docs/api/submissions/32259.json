Today is my birthday and last night after several small incidents with my friend I had her removed from my hotel room after she refused to leave.\n\nIt started out small. She would order the most expensive thing on the menu and I snapped. She said if you can afford this expensive hotel room and a new car you can spare an extra $10. (She has no money, and no job).\n\nNext was her drinking out of my wine bottle. I had already told her before do not put your mouth on my bottle because I don\u2019t know where your mouth has been. Then for a second time she did it again with a brand new bottle and said she planned on drinking the whole thing and it\u2019s not a big deal. I bought the bottle and it was still half full.\n\nFollowing we went downtown to a lounge that I wanted to go to for my birthday and as soon as we walked in while I was asking the bartender how the place operates she cuts him off and tells me to let\u2019s go, we\u2019re leaving very rudely and storms out, and I followed not thinking. We had a chat outside and I told her I wanted to go there and she said we can\u2019t go back because of how she acted.\n\nAfter I decided to go back to the hotel and she asked to go to the gas station. I told three times that day not to eat in my car and she proceeded to open a paper bowl of boiled peanuts filled to the rim with liquid and asked me to drive slow so she could eat it. I cursed her out and made her put the lid back on.\n\nPissed, I drove back to the hotel grabbed my stuff, left her there to go out with another friend to bring in my birthday and had to turn back around to grab a bottle of wine I left at the hotel.\n\nWhen I got back to the room she locked the door and I could see through the crack that she was standing at the door. I told her to remove the lock and she kept saying no repeatedly. Then eventually she unlocked the door.\n\nOnce it was opened I held it open and said she needed to get out, that I\u2019m tired of the disrespect and she needed to go. She refused and said I needed to take her home or get her an Uber and I said no. I threatened to call the police and then she picked up the hotel phone and asked them to call for her.\n\nSecurity came up and I told them my name is on the room and I want her out so they removed her.\n\nBased off what she said I\u2019m the a-hole for not taking her home knowing she has no car, money, service phone, many people to help her.\n\nWith that being said AITA?", "created_utc": 1701612433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189u7jn/aita_for_having_security_remove_my_friend_from_my/", "score": 449, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even down to swearing at her. I\u2019ve always kept my composure and would just breathe through it, but this time my fuse was extremely short. I\u2019m partially embarrassed by how I acted and she kept recording on her phone the entire day, even when I told her to get out she was recording, and it definitely paints me in a bad light. \n\nShe kept saying I was controlling every time something was done and I reflected back like \u201cam I really being controlling\u201d. Even reading my original post back I kept typing \u201cmy\u201d and now I\u2019m wondering if I came off like that around her. Like, don\u2019t buy the most expensive things on my dime if you wouldn\u2019t do it with yours (she even admitted it was intentional), don\u2019t put your mouth on my bottle (I had several so I didn\u2019t care how much was consumed, and she kept opening and pouring them and never had to ask, well, never did ask), don\u2019t eat in my car (I don\u2019t eat in it).\n\nWe\u2019ve been friends for 3 years and she always done stuff like and I\u2019ve kept calm, but this time really affected me differently.\n\nI don\u2019t know it had me a bit confused and wondering if I handled it poorly and was an ahole.", "Full transparency, everyone knows she is. I called her mom last week and told her she needs help before she hurts herself, someone else and end up somewhere she doesn\u2019t belong. \n\nHer mom said she\u2019s tried and she refuses. Her mom kicked her out two weeks ago because she came to blows with her and my friend reached out to me for help. We were not on good terms after another incident she and I had where she crossed an extreme boundary of mine, but I still I gave her money for a hotel room and then she contacted me letting me know what was going on. I was going out to dinner with friends for my birthday and invited her out with us to celebrate that\u2019s how she ended up at the hotel the following day.\n\nHer ex kicked her out, Her mom kicked her out, and unfortunately I had to have her removed because it\u2019s just too much.\n\nI don\u2019t know what her mental health issue is but I\u2019ve tried and tried with her and I keep getting hurt.

Don\u2019t let people walk all over you and use you like this.", "Why are you assuming this is a mental health issue and not a being a selfish jerk issue?\n\nAs someone with mental health issues I don't appreciate being lumped in with everyone acting like they're the main character of the universe to the detriment of those around them. \n\nShe treated you poorly, disrespected reasonable requests, and ruined your birthday. Unless she was fully in a fugue state, that's pretty unacceptable. It doesn't particularly matter if she's having mental health issues, those are a reason for behaviour, not an excuse. If she is too unstable to admit that her garbage behaviour was a problem, then you need to carve out some space for yourself. It doesn't matter why someone is being a jerk to you if they refuse to acknowledge or fix it.", "Let her know you\u2019ll be there for her emotionally but that she has crossed too many lines for you to be able to be her financial/physical support. Gently encourage her to get help. You could offer to pay for therapy if that\u2019s something you can do and want to. But draw a clear line that you will not allow her into your home (or hotels!) until she gets help. You will not allow her to take advantage of you.\n\nPeople in need of help this way sometimes are best helped by being cut off. If you keep the emotional tie and let her know you\u2019ll be there for her in the other side, that sounds like the best way you can support her at this time.", "My 5 year old niece has better manners and she's still learning.", "I have enemies that treat me better than that \"friend\" treats you!"]}
