He\u2019ll either start calling his friends, go eat, go to the bathroom, take a nap, tell me about his day, or start working on budgeting. Some days he doesn\u2019t even touch his son at all. \n\nI do the bedtime routine everyday and i wake up with him in the morning before my partner leaves for work. I don\u2019t often get time alone and when i do, i spend it eating, using the restroom, or having a quick snack. I hope that my partner will one day come home and ask me if i need anything and say he\u2019ll take our baby so i can go shower, have a full meal, etc. \n\nLast night, he got home and told me he was going to take a nap and to wake him up if i needed him. Around 6:50, i woke him up telling him i needed his help to give our baby a bath (our baby has gained a lot of weight recently and my partner has helped to lift him out of the tub to hand back to me). \n\nHe told me no and he\u2019d keep sleeping. I got extremely angry and started yelling at him and told him i feel like a single mother and why am i with him if he won\u2019t be a partner or father.\n\nOur baby began to cry because it was getting late and he was tired so i called my mom to come help me. She yelled at my partner saying nobody cares if he\u2019s tired, hungry, or sick; he has to take care of the baby because if our baby isn\u2019t cared for, she\u2019d call DCS. \n\nHe tried explaining himself and said i can do it myself. I told him it isn\u2019t fair and i shouldn\u2019t have to take care of our child by myself if he\u2019s there and capable. He returned with \u201cyou\u2019re capable so go take care of it\u201d.\n\nEventually, he said that he meant i should go get started and he\u2019d join me in a minute.

He doesn't get to come home and relax, you too have just clocked out, and now everyone is parenting and working together.", "Info - aside from money, what does your partner bring to the relationship?", "NTA - one person being a stay at home parent doesn't mean the other person doesn't have to also be a parent. You are right - he should be your partner, not a roommate who just does whatever he wants all the time. This made my blood boil. I am the working parent in my house and my husband currently stays at home; when I finish work for the day, I immediately jump in to help because  a) I'm also a parent, not just him, and b) working is MUCH easier than taking care of a baby full time.

You are both parents, he needs to step up and act like it, instead of acting like another child. If you left him tomorrow, your workload would actually decrease because you\u2019d have less laundry, less cooking, and less cleaning to do without a full grown child adding to your burdens. The only thing he contributes now is money but that\u2019s not the only thing a partner should be adding. If you got paid the wage of a nanny ($20/hour), house cleaner ($35/hour) and private chef ($35/meal) you probably are worth more to the household than he is at this point\u2026 but he doesn\u2019t value your work the same as his. \n\nWhen he is at work he gets breaks. You don\u2019t. When he is at work he takes lunch. You hopefully do but only when you get the chance. He starts his day with a shower. You have to beg him to take care of *his own child* just so that you get that same luxury.  He gets to talk to adults all day. You have no one to talk to and a screaming child. He gets personal space and the respect of physical boundaries from his coworkers. You have a human clinging to you, suckling from you, pooping and peeing on you, sleeping on you and relying on you for their very existence.\n\nHonestly work sounds pretty easy in comparison. No?

Tell him you need to start sharing responsibilities in the home, he needs to start being a father to his son. That means sharing night wakes, bedtimes, spending valuable time together as a couple. At 4 months old your baby is old enough for you to have an at-home \"date\" night once a week, where your partner can cook you a meal or you can order in, play some board games, do a jigsaw or watch a movie. \n\nIf he can't offer even that then you should consider leaving him.", "NTA. my husband is 23 and works full time while I'm a SAHM. when he comes home he takes on baby duty while I rest then at night we split it up.

Your partner is likely struggling with new fatherhood too which is normal.\n\nSee if he would be open to counseling if you want to save the relationship.

Because he was napping he may have been half asleep when he responded. He should absolutely be helping you but you can't just hope he will, use your words. Don't stew then yell.", "ESH - yelling accomplishes nothing productive. To your specific question ESH for yelling, threatening to call child protection services because he doesn\u2019t want to get up, and not engaging in family time after work. To your overall predicament, NTA. As someone else said on here, he has a full time job and you have a full time job, afterwards you both are full time parents. Maybe explore alternatives, like you get a part time job outside of the home for awhile on his days off or have him reduce his hours worked by a day or half day and fill that in with employment outside of the home. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything fancy, just something to break you away for a bit and illustrate to him what being tethered to someone entirely dependent on you is really like.", "NAH. I know I'm going to get downvoted but oh well. You guys are kids yourselves and have no idea how to be in an adult relationship. You have no idea how to communicate your frustrations/wants and your partner has no idea how to be a good partner. You two are learning together how to be partners and it will all fall apart without clear communication and compromise. Quit \"hoping\" he will do something or ask something and *tell* him your feelings. I understand you woke him up to ask him for help but you got so upset you yelled because you had all this frustration that had been building up that he had no idea about. He could just be modeling what he seen growing up or what he thinks he is supposed to do. He needs to work on helping you more and you need to work on communicating more.", "ESH. First of all, yelling at your partner is never the path to success.  Having your MOTHER yell at your partner is way out of line.   That is NEVER her place, and you need to tell her so.  I also notice you say \"partner\" and not spouse, which is also part of the problem. Do things in the wrong order, you get the wrong result.\n\nIf you are a stay at home mom, it doesn't mean that 100% of your time is devoted to the child, and he gets a free pass when he gets home.  It DOES mean that the vast, vast majority of childcare, even when he is home is still on you.  Honestly, when you are caring for a child, you are NOT doing so for at least half of the time, between naps, etc. \n\nThat said, he needs to spend time with the kids when he's home (I assume they're all his?)  and he doesn't get to pretend he's still 16 and ignore these responsibilities.   You guys all have some work to do.", "ESH. If things are at the point where your family is threatening to call DCS, you have a really big problem. This poor child. You chose this man.", "You're NTA but I will be giving your husband the benifit of doubt even though you don't paint him in a good light, since waking up from a nap won't be the time you really going to get people being full of energy most of the time.  \n\n\nHe simply doesn't notice how much you are struggling. As nice as a thought it is he will never, by his own, just come to you and offer his help, from his point of view everything seems fine. I mean he literaly says it to you so believe what he says. It seems he is a bit lazy in that regard.  \n\n\nYou have to communicate to him that things can't work the way they are going now, having one of bursts of frustration or your mom yelling at your partner won't change anything. Tell him exactly what makes you unhappy currently, it might be even helpful to write it down beforehand so you know it better yourself.  \n\n\nIt might help too if you are very specific in how things. Like not just \"I want you to be more involved with our family\" but things like \"Please put the baby to be bed every 2nd night\". You know your own partner the best compared to us and what works with him and not what. Also be carful of things improving for 1 or 2 weeks and then things slipping back into the regular patern again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is why a guy has to clock off work then start extra hours helping his wife catch a break. Also, it is his kid too. He needs to parent and care for the baby too. He needs to actually be a father.
