He has been having a lot of pain from arthritis and other ailments, and he has been asking Mom to massage some areas around his back and legs he couldn\u2019t reach.\r  \n\r  \nI noticed this, and I asked him if he wanted to use my Theragun massager. His eyes lit up, and he asked me what it was, so I brought it down stairs and let him try. Boy, you would have thought I brought up a pile of gold. He was using that thing the entire time he was here.\r  \n\r  \nSince I noticed he was really loving it, I asked him towards the end of the trip if he wanted to keep it. He kind of hesitated and mentioned to me that it was too nice to just give it to him. However, I reassured him and said it\u2019s yours, and he really seemed genuinely happy. He asked me again right before he left, and I said it\u2019s 100% fine, and enjoy it.\r  \n\r  \nThis made me really happy, but this is where I might have messed up.\r  \n\r  \nThis Theragun was a present from my wife a few years ago. I appreciated the gift, but I never got much use out of it. I didn\u2019t really like the way it felt, and I don\u2019t have many soreness issues.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife asked me after they left why I gave him her present. I told her I didn\u2019t know it would bother her, and I was sorry. She thinks that I should have known that it would hurt her feelings, and it was insensitive. In no way was I trying to hurt her; I only wanted to make my dad happy by giving him something he could use. I know he would use it, and that\u2019s good enough for me.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife is still hurt about this, and I don\u2019t know what else to do or say.

You weren't using it. Wouldn't your wife prefer HER FIL use it, when he derives so much relief from it? How can she be so selfish? \"Oh no, you should have left it in the back of the closet so I know you appreciate it instead of giving it to someone who can genuinely use it.\" She needs to grow up.", "NTA\n1. She gave you a gift- now it's yours. YOURS: You own the gift and can do as you wish with it.\n2. You weren't using it, so it makes no sense keeping it to gather webs and dust.\n3. If it made you're father happy, which in turn made you happy. She should also be genuinely happy seeing your happiness- if she loved you.\n4. She should be mature enough and look at the bigger picture.", "NTA. Obviously you were right to take the Theragun out of retirement and give it to your dad. It should be where it's getting used. It's so obvious that I think your wife is really upset about something else. You might want to dig into this issue a little deeper. Does she feel unappreciated in general?", "NAH, but it might have helped to mention it to your wife before she found out from your dad. \n\nYou certainly didn\u2019t need her permission, but it probably would have made her feel good if you\u2019d let her know what a great gift it turned out to be because it brought you such happiness to see it work for your dad. Just a thought.", "NAH.\n\nI would tell your wife,\n\n\"Thank you. It was a great gift, just for the wrong person. It helps my dad out immensely.\"\n\nYou could also tell your dad to thank your wife for it. Let the old man tell your wife how much he appreciates it.", "**NTA**   She gave it to you a few years ago and you hardly ever use it, it was essentially another piece of closet clutter.   She should be happy that it has found a home with someone who needs it rather than going out in a Goodwill bin another 5 years from now.", "Her hurt is understandable.  So is your position.  It was yours to regift.  While it may not be great etiquette it was done with your heart in the right place.  Personally, once the explanation was given I would have been fine with it, but others clearly would feel differently.\n\nYeah talking to her first might have been good.  Buying him his own might have been good - although he may not have taken it.\n\nAt this point your wife is right that what's done is done.  You have, imo, adequately apologized for it.  It is now up to her to move past it.  While this may be a transgression, I can't go so far as to declare you an asshole for making it.   It is a relatively minor one.", "NAH I understand both sides. I gave my parents a Philips soup maker which is like $150 because my dad LOVES soup. A year later, they gave it to my sister. I was a bit hurt because I thought they\u2019d love it but it was still in the box in the closet, a year later. So, I got over it. Hopefully, your wife will, too.", "NTA, you werent using it and it was definitely not some memorable keepsake. shes being unreasonable and overly sensitive about it. plus you already apologized and now you know for the future. also who tf uses google for gifting etiquette? if you are going to give me something dont attach strings otherwise you can keep it.", "NTA **He has been having a lot of pain from arthritis and other ailments, and . . . I asked him if he wanted to use my Theragun massager.** You gave something you owned and didn't use to someone you loved for their pain relief. Empathy, compassion and love beat etiquette \"rules\" every time - even Miss Manners and Emily Post would agree! Your wife needs to accept your sincere apology and she should be able to see the bigger picture and be happy your dad found pain relief, incidentally, indirectly because of her. So, why can't she let this go? Is she so insecure about her standing with you and/or jealous of your relationship with your father that she's sees the incident as cut-and-dry you care about him more than her? That is sadly shallow and an AH move. Good luck OP.", "NTA!!  What good is a gift if it's sitting for years in the closet & can help someone else?  What a good & loving son!!", "NTA once you give something to someone, you no longer have any say on what they do with it. Its not like you pawned your wedding ring or something of a sentimental value, it is a massager.   \nI think this may be just crossed wires of love languages so I dont think shes an asshole either. If someone came to my house and I lent them something they loved or it helped them in some way, I would hand it over and give it to them as a show of love.   \nYour wife obviously has some attachment to the gifts shes given you, and expects you to have the same love language as her. We all have different love languages, but when I hand someone money on the street, I am aware that then, that is no longer my money, I dont get to dictate what they do with it.", "Of course she feels hurt - regardless of how often you used it, it\u2019s still a present she gave to you. Soft YTA - not for gifting it to your father, but more for not checking with her beforehand, which I think might be the main reason she\u2019s upset", "Soft YTA.\n\nRegifting an expensive gift is hurtful to the original giver. This is common knowledge. You could have at least discussed it with her, (putting the emphasis on how much your dad loved it rather than on \"I don't like it.\")", "Dude. I would never waste time getting you a present any more. I\u2019d get you a little throw away gift and that would be it. \n\nI mean sure, it was your thing and you can do whatever you want with it, but this is AITa not Am I Allowed To Do This. And yeah, sure you\u2019re allowed to but that doesn\u2019t remove the consequences of how it makes her feel or what she decides to do with gifts from here on out. \n\nEven if it wasn\u2019t a gift I\u2019d expect my husband to talk to me before he just gave away a multi hundred dollar item from our house - and he\u2019d expect the same of me.", "I think this is a YTA case where a lot of you have been swayed by eloquence. OP isn't a bad guy, he loves his dad and did a nice thing for him. But he did this without talking to his wife at all. Those are not inexpensive gifts. His wife may have put a lot of thought into that. This guy may be one of those people who thinks of everyone but their spouse. I think that despite the fact its his to give, he should've mentioned it to his wife. Something tells me he has failed to consider her feelings in similar situations before.", "I would say Bollocks to the \" I didn't know it would bother you\" part. Really, if you are that shallow and unaware then yes, you are indeed an AH.", "First off if you were thinking about giving it away you should\u2019ve discussed this with your wife, mentioned the reasons of why he could use it more; of how you weren\u2019t and it wasn\u2019t really helpful to you.  Could\u2019ve said it was a gift from both of you to give credit to her as well for being thoughtful. But in this case YTA, there are many different ways you could\u2019ve handled this and asking her input first is where is should have started.  She hurt that she put thought into this gift and then you without consulting her just gave it away, how would you feel if you put a lot of thought and effort into a gift for her and she just gave it away saying \u201csorry what\u2019s done is done\u201d kind of deal.  Communication is key bud.  Always communicate, almost everything with your partner so they are aware of situations, thoughts and the reasoning behind them.  Apologize profusely, explain why you felt he could use it more and why you felt it was a good idea as you didn\u2019t use it, it was helping you etc.  might not fix it but could create a better understanding of why you did what you did.", "Gonna go against the grain and say soft YTA. I get you weren\u2019t using it\u2026 but your wife bought it for you. A discussion before giving it to your dad would have been at least considerate. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly not about you giving it away- it\u2019s that you gave it away before telling your wife WHY you gave it away when she gave it to you as a gift. Regifting is never cool.\n\nIt\u2019s lovely your dad experienced relief from the device-  you could have bought him his own version. \n\nI just think you owe your wife an apology. It was a gift from her to you. Yes, it\u2019s now yours- but she picked it out thinking you\u2019d love it. I just think an honest conversation and apology needs to occur.", "NTA per se but you probably should have asked her if it would be okay to do it.", "You are definitely not an asshole, just a poor guesser, what you did was very right (blessed your father) and terribly wrong (give something away your wife had given you) \nMake things right , buy some nice flowers and chocolate or something else that your wife likes and then write on the card: I am sorry , I was an idiot .\nYou sound like a wonderful human to me .\nGood luck", "Yta\n\nFirst and most important: what is your problem with communication? Why can't you talk with your wife about your idea of gifting something she putted her  money in? You have some kind of problem when talking to her before giving something she bought with love to you?\n\nThe problem isn't gifting your gift, the problem here is that that thing have a sentimental meaning to your wife.\n\nI put my money in the fact she really, really tough about what gift you and seeing you just give it away without any thoughts are like a slaps in the face.\n\n\nIs like you actually don't liked it and pretend to like it but in the first opportunity just send it away.\n\nSorry, but you are an ass for you lack of communication and for don't putting a single though about the feeling involved in the gift given.\n\nAnd more, for putting your father above her... Because, as you say you would do anything for you father... But not for you wife.", "NTA. You've gad it fir a few years and barely use it. Your dad would get alot more use out if it. It's a massager, not a sentimental gift.", "NTA. I would say n a h bc I\u2019m always sympathetic to someone whose gift is not appreciated, but her googling to \u201cprove\u201d that you\u2019re in the wrong does push her over into AH territory. Any decent person knows that sometimes a gift just isn\u2019t the right fit. Don\u2019t make a big deal out of it when it happens.", "You should have talked to your wife beforehand and let her know that you were thinking of giving it to your dad. Step up the communication", "NTA \nYou hadn't used it in 2 years, it just sat in a closet. You gave it to your dad who apparently loved it and will continue using it. Would your wife prefer it stayed in the closet? Or for her FIL to reap the benefits of using it?", "Nah my husband is really sentimental about his gifts so I keep even the ones I don't really care for. I'm a lot less sentimental but I just ask before I give away stuff and it has never been an issue.  I can see why it comes off a little rude. \n\nI think people are being pretty mean to your wife. It's not like she cussed out your dad, her feelings are just a little hurt nbd", "NTA I would rather the item get used by someone instead of being shuffled around the house before being sold on marketplace or a yard sale.  It\u2019s not like OP wrapped the massager and gave it to an unsuspecting recipient.  He brought the massager out for dad to try and he loved it and actually used it.  At that point OP gave it to him because what would\u2019ve happened to it?  Banished to the basement closet never to be used again?  It\u2019s a hoarder mentality to keep things that don\u2019t suit you and never will use.  I wouldn\u2019t have asked my SO if it was ok to give my gift away.  If it was sentimental or significant then it would be different it\u2019s just a massager and nothing more.  If it was a watch or an article of clothing by she painstakingly picked out then I would say Y T A but it\u2019s not it\u2019s just another mechanical device that won\u2019t be used just like the electric knife from the wedding. Lol", "YTA. You are your dad\u2019s hero at your wife\u2019s expense. Good job you.", "NTA- I think you didn\u2019t do it to be cruel your intentions were not of an arsehole nature it was to help your dad who was in pain. It bought you joy to see him get some relief from it. \n\nAgree with some of the other comments re love language, maybe you don\u2019t understand each others language. I do think your wife is being weird googling about gift etiquette. Would she have been the same if it was her dad you gave it to?", "NTA. I'm with you - the gift was a nice gesture, but it turned out to be something that doesn't work for you. In such cases, it's better to pass the gift along to someone who will both use and appreciate it.", "Nta it was a gift. Itwas yours  to do as you wanted. You werent using it. That's what a gift is.  It was not loaned to you. You owned it. You are a good son.", "NTA. It\u2019s a practical gift, not a sentimental one. And your dad needed it!", "NTA but you really should have gotten him his own or talked to your wife before giving it away. You were trying to help your dad and thus I don\u2019t think anyone could attack your motives.", "NTA. Once something is gifted, it is yours to do with as you wish, and that includes regifting. You don't need to ask permission to give something that is yours, unless it also belongs to your wife or would unduly burden your wife should you give it away. IE, if you owned the only car and donated it to a family member or something.", "Have you been faking interest in the Theragun? If your wife was under the impression that you still used the item and that it was a gift you enjoyed I could see why she would be upset. \n\nBut if she knew that you hadn\u2019t used the gift in a long time and that your family member really appreciated it, then it\u2019s fine to give away something that was gifted to you.\n\nThe etiquette article your wife is citing is if you re-gift a gift to someone and pretend as if the gift is brand new and that you purchased it for them. \nI\u2019m leaning towards NTA.", "NTA. Your wife just seems to be overreacting. Infact she should be happy that her gift is greatly helping her FIL.", "NTA\n\nYou haven't used it much, you really didn't need it.\nYes, you should have asked first, if it's okay with her to give it away.\nBut then it really doesn't seem to have been the most thought-out gift anyway, sooo... *ReeseWitherspoonShrugs.gif", "NTA what a petty person your wife is. This not \u2018re gifting\u2019. You did not pretend you brought it for him. You were not using it and he needed it. I can\u2019t believe she was not happy that her FIL was getting some use from something that was otherwise sitting in the cupboard.

You mean to tell me your wife was happier with you owning the massage gun and barely using it over the last couple of years than seeing it given to her father-in-law who greatly appreciated it and basically needed it to help him with his arthritis? The sentimental value of it just collecting dust is what she's upset about? I mean sure, you could've asked her if it's cool to give it away but the second a gift is given it's no longer her concern what's done with it.
