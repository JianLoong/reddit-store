He was born in Spain and his family still lives there and in the time of our relationship about 4 years have not visited the states since. I have never been introduced to his family not even on a FaceTime call which I always wished changed but he wanted to make meeting them special. My family have met my fianc\u00e9 many times and they all love him, we are also Dominican so the language barrier with his family wouldn\u2019t matter. \n\nIn February my fianc\u00e9 family planned to visit for about 2 months since it\u2019s been so long. I live in my own place so they\u2019d be staying with my fianc\u00e9 only. His mom, dad, sister, and brother in law all came and they planned a dinner party with me and some of my fianc\u00e9s friends and coworkers (more like a welcome party). I was beyond excited to meet them and finally announce our engagement.\n\nThe day came and I went over to his house. My fianc\u00e9 talked to me prior and told me his family is very outspoken and if his mom says anything out of line to not worry ab it. He said this concerning our age, cultural dif, and my job (special ed teacher and my fianc\u00e9 is a lawyer). I was kinda worried because I didn\u2019t want them to think poorly of me based on all that but he assured he\u2019d be there to back me up. \n\nThe party starts and I prepped everything, cooked the food and set the tables. His parents arrived and see me and ask who I was. He pauses and says I\u2019m his gf. I looked at him shocked and he gave me a go along with it look. Beyond my better judgment I agreed. The dinner goes on and my fianc\u00e9s parents make a judgmental comment ab the dr where my families from. I corrected them and then she makes comments about my curly hair and how odd it was. My fianc\u00e9 said nothing and tried to change the convo. Later on it was brought up how young I was and he says it doesn\u2019t matter. My job got brought up and they said there\u2019s no way I can survive off my salary. \n\nDuring the dinner I completely forgot I had my ring on and his mom spotted it and says, \u201cthat\u2019s not an engagement ring is it?\u201d My fianc\u00e9 gives me an angry look like I was supposed to know I was playing gf tonight and says it\u2019s my grandmas old ring. I was fed up and said we have been engaged for awhile and he\u2019s lying to you for God knows what. I leave without saying another word and get a shit ton of calls from him. \n\nHe said he wanted to get his moms approval before announcing and I told him then what the fuck was the point of engaging in the first place. I was pissed to sit there and lie to save his ass. He said his mom thought that was very disrespectful and immature. She doesn\u2019t see why I couldn\u2019t wait until after and talk to him. She completely dismissed him lying to her face but that\u2019s not my concern. I left the ring in his mailbox and haven\u2019t seen them since.

Run, sis.", "NTA.\n\nYour ex-fiance is an idiot, not to mention incredibly disrespectful toward you.  I'm sure culturally he felt he was supposed to get their permission before getting engaged, but he didn't, and he needed to man up before you were introduced to his family.\n\nThe idiot part comes in where he didn't talk to you before hand and get your agreement that you would pretend not to be engaged.  Otherwise of COURSE you were going to wear your engagement ring to meet his family.", "NTA! So for a dinner party at this dude's house, you were expected to do all the cooking and preparation, then pretend to be only a girlfriend so 32-year-old dude's mommy won't get upset? Run like the wind and do not look back at this xenophobic ignorant family and make this dude your ex.", "NTA. Just keep in mind that these people will be in your life going forward and it appears that your fianc\u00e9 is either too scared or too placid to not keep them in line when interfering with his life. You need to sit down and have a serious conversation with him whether he is with you, or if he plans to keep letting them shit all over you for the rest of your life- \n\nOr see this as a dodged bullet and call things off.", "Be glad this happened before you went through with the marriage.\n\nHugely disrespectful to you.\n\nNTA", "NTA and hopefully, not his fiance or girlfriend anymore.", "NTA...don't marry this guy.  What a weird situation.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry you had to sit through that. \n\nBased on what you\u2019ve written, he doesn\u2019t sound like a good partner. He didn\u2019t have your back and he didn\u2019t even tell you in advance that his family didn\u2019t know you\u2019re engaged, so he didn\u2019t allow you to prepare and be on the same page. This doesn\u2019t sound like a partnership to me. \n\nIf I were in your shoes I\u2019d think long and hard about taking the ring back, if he offers it.", "NTA. He treated you very poorly as did his family. Be glad you got away before the wedding.", "NTA\n\nAt least this happened before marrying and hiaving his kids. Now you know what kind of \"man\" he is.", "Wtf? Totally NTA. So let me get this straight. You\u2019ve been engaged for a year and a half and he didn\u2019t bother mentioning this to his family at all. His family didn\u2019t even know who you were when they got to his house for dinner, so he\u2019s probably never even shared so much as a photo of you with them. It seems like he\u2019s never really bothered to mention you to them at all. What the hell kind of a fianc\u00e9 is this idiot? How did he think this was going to go? I\u2019d forget this loser and find someone who is proud to be with you and doesn\u2019t hide your relationship from his family.", "NTA, your fianc\u00e9 didn't even warn you that you would be downgraded to just a gf and be criticized for being you. His mother is a horrid woman and your fianc\u00e9 just allowed her to treat you like crap. The lie about the ring was just too much. I don't blame you for leaving and giving the ring back until he can sincerely apologize. However, you should rethink if you really want to marry someone like him. It's like you're an embarrassment to him. Which is total complete bs.", "NTA. He didn't back you up and that is a red flag. Hold tight to that shiny spine of yours!", "NTA - in one meeting, you were downgraded to G/F, told to lie and then insulted for the way you look and the career you've chosen... aaaaaaand afterwards, he's still gaslighting you. I don't know what a true apology looks like- but I kinda think you should run", "NTA\n\nThe first thing he says to you is not to worry if his mom says something that is out of line. \n\nNope. No way.\n\nThere isn't an apology that makes up for someone pretending you don't exist to their family.", "NTA, this is concerning. He knew his mom \u201cwouldn\u2019t approve\u201d of you and instead of being prepared to back you up, he threw you to the wolves. Also, he sounds like a momma\u2019s boy, and unless you want to spend your entire marriage never being good enough for his mom, you should run.", "NTA Don't lie to your parents. If you can't trust them you should probably fix that", "Nta it's weird that he gave you warnings but did not include the fact that his family don't know you're engaged and that he wanted to warm them up to the idea first. No way you could be expected to interpret that.", "NTA- he obviously cares more for his mothers feelings than for yours. If you allow them to disrespect you from the beginning, it will never end.", "Do not accept an apology and do not go back to him. He has zero respect for you or being \nEngaged.", "There are so many marinara flags it's like a dang lasagna.\n\n\nNTA.", "I started reading this and thought maybe he introduced you as his girlfriend as he wanted to make a big announcement about the engagement, but as he didn\u2019t that is seriously disrespectful and put you in such an awkward position. NTA!", "nta\n\nyou didnt dodge a bullet you dodged a tactical nuke with this idiot.", "This man really thought you would show up and get blindsided and just go along with this? After giving you an engagement ring? THAT YOU WERE WEARING?\n\nForget the nonsense, you\u2019re NTA but like\u2026 he needs to do crimes better, this is embarrassing for him. Like\u2026 that\u2019s honestly worse to me lol, behaving like such a clown and expecting to get away with it\u2026 nope. I\u2019d break it off for the clownery more than anything like yeah the lying to his parents, but the laziness of the lying!! The audacity.", "NTA \n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 doesn't value you enough to proudly introduce you as his fianc\u00e9e to his family, is it worth going on? He downplayed your relationship, lied about the engagement ring and let his family disrespect you. And then excused his lying by saying he wanted his mother's approval, like he's 2 instead of 32.\n\nHe should have told you the entire situation beforehand and asked you to go along with it. Then you could've agreed or refused, instead of springing all this on you because he's too afraid of his mother to act like the grown man he's supposed to be.\n\nWhat you do from here on out is entirely your decision. But his behaviour sounds like a foreshadowing of what your married life is going to be like. Him hiding you and the nature of your relationship from his family, not telling you things you should know, because he's gutless, and you finding out in the moment and having to accommodate him and/or clean up the mess he's made.\n\nHis family sound snobby at best and prejudiced at worst. Your fianc\u00e9 obviously knew his family would look down on you for being Dominican, for not having a job they think is worthy, for not being good enough for their precious son. \n\nAnd instead of him putting on his big boy pants and standing up for you, the woman he's supposed to love and want to spend the rest of his life with, he let them go at you and left you to flounder.\n\nYou may need to have a serious think about whether this relationship has a future. His family are probably going to always treat you differently, and when push comes to shove it sounds like he'll always shove you under the bus to stay in Mummy Dearest's good graces whenever she voices her displeasure.", "What, so you were supposed to sit there while he starts your relationship off with his parents with a big fat lie? What kind of ridiculous expectation is THAT??? You are absolutely NTA. I guess silver lining is that he showed you his priority list before you actually married the dude, but wow. What shitty behavior.", "NTA I hope you come to see this as a lucky escape. He's a mama's boy.", "NTA. This man is deceitful and manipulative, and his family sounds cruel. You deserve better. You did the right thing leaving the ring in his mailbox. Move on and find a man who will be honest with you and love and respect you in the way you deserve.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thankfully you found this out before actually getting married and/or having kids.", "NTA, but please have some self respect  and don't marry this man. You gave the ring back which is a good thing. Don't hold out hopes for an apology because he has already shown you who he is. He has hidden you from his family this entire time.

Regardless of the general social practice, this was clearly a different case than the semantics of how to describe the relationship The parents didn\u2019t even  know who she was and they are supposedly serious! For him to go as dismissive as girlfriend in light of that or to not have at least given her a heads up that this is what it would be like is ridiculous behavior on his part.\n\nIf he was at a work function, fine.

He also made the comment about wanting his mom to approve of me before saying we were engaged which brings me to believe the gf bit was not a tradition.
