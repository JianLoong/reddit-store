I was happy for her until recently. \n\nI was talking to a mutual friend of ours and she started gushing about how Tia\u2019s essay was so heartfelt and beautiful. I asked to see it because I thought she had just forgotten to show me (she showed me many of her essay drafts). But as I was reading it, I was completely taken aback. The essay was one of MY college essay drafts which I\u2019d shown to Tia for reference on writing TECHNIQUES ONLY. I made this clear. \n\nI was livid. The essay was really personal, and she barely even tweaked it up. It was almost entirely copied and pasted. I trusted her with it, and this is what she did. \n\nIn a fit of rage, I gathered all the evidence of me helping her with the college process, including evidence of me sending the specific essay to her, and I showed it to the school. She not only lost her scholarship, but she also lost her seat in the school. \n\nNow, people are calling me dramatic and shaming me for robbing her of her education. She\u2019s the only person in her family to get into college and receive an academic and athletic scholarship, so everyone was rooting for her, including me at one time. And while I didn\u2019t expect the outcome to be so severe, it was. \n\nRight now, I feel bad. I feel terrible. I feel like she took advantage of me, but I didn\u2019t want to be the cause of something so horrible. I did myself a justice, but at the cost of someone\u2019s dreams.

Plagiarizing is a huge deal and colleges take it very seriously.

I understand that not everyone really 'gets' it and you're coming in for a lot of flack, but the truth is, academic integrity is *important*. It's not just that she stole from you (which matters), or that she took a spot someone more deserving could get (which also matters). It's also that if it works once, people tend to do it again - and again, and again.\n\nIn their best case scenario, it might be years before it gets found out if it ever does, but it means that any of their professional or academic success is not based on their own skill and learning but someone else's, which has strong implications for the quality of their work and how it may affect other people's lives. Think about it this way: do you want the architect designing your house to be a plagiarist? They can't just lift bits from one design to fit into another; they have to genuinely know how the pieces fit together and how to convert them so they can work together.\n\nDo you want the surgeon operating on your liver to have cheated their way through medical school? The old joke is, what do you call the med student who graduates at the bottom of their class - you call them doctor. \n\nPlagiarists tend to see what they do as a victimless crime, but the truth is that it isn't. Ask any academic fighting to prove that their work stolen was in fact stolen. Almost as bad, the plagiarist is stealing their own chance of improving their own work and abilities from themselves.\n\nYou did not do this to her. She did this to herself. If her dreams were so important to her, she should have tried to attain them without trying to steal yours from you. I'm sure you would have helped her directly - had she asked.

Did this happen last year?

For a college, plagiarism is not tolerated, and you snitched on her plagiarizing an essay, which is why she predictably lost everything. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, what she did was wrong and makes her an AH. But as a friend, I would never snitch on my friend on an already cutthroat, biased and unfair admissions process that doesn\u2019t affect me in any way.

Not going to be popular, but college acceptance is scamfuckery cheating or not. I think the only thing here is breach of trust. That\u2019s shitty, but showing it to the school is also shitty. There\u2019s an argument to be made that it could be even shittier depending on what you value. \n\nThey had an opportunity, and now it\u2019s gone. I think the value of that scholarship and college acceptance to them is worth more than a betrayal of trust in your end. Does that make it right? No. It doesn\u2019t. But I also don\u2019t think it is necessarily justice to take away that persons opportunity, because actual justice would be everybody gets the education that they deserve, and colleges inherently don\u2019t serve that anyway. \n\nI\u2019ll also lay out my bias. I would not be mad if friend did this, with my consent. That consent would be contingent on them admitting to it if either were caught. I feel in that instance they probably wouldn\u2019t risk it either, and I probably wouldn\u2019t either. But that\u2019s the only instance I would let that happen.

However that is my bias.", "Yes yes you are the asshole. But so was she for using it without asking. You lost nothing by her copying it and gained nothing by turning her in.

Ask these people if it\u2019s okay for Tia to cheat her way into college, and ask them if they would be okay with her using their personal experiences as her own to get into college. They\u2019re not looking at the whole picture, or possibly don\u2019t know the entire story. But ignore them, they don\u2019t care about you at all. \n\nAlso, never ever share anything with someone that is yours which could possibly benefit someone else (academically, at work). Even if it was meant to be helpful, it can be misconstrued as cheating.

She probably could have gotten into that school on her own merits - an essay is only one part of an application. Instead, she demonstrated a lack of academic integrity.\n\nYou'll catch a lot of flak, as people don't like snitches. But it's better ahe was caught plagiarizing now than when she's enrolled.

But it also might not be - how dishonest do you have to be to plagiarize an essay of little real significance, when you already had reasonable non-plagisrized essays you could have sent?\n\nFurther, something like this would have started an investigation, and the consequences would have been based on Tia's reaction to the investigation as much as event herself.  Plagiarism is bad, and sadly ubiquitous, and a single instance isn't usually a career killer.  She would have been contacted to answer your allegations; the results would have been based as much on her response as on the original action.\n\nIf she was a strong candidate for the school and scholarship, and came in apologetic, explaining how she genuinely didn't understand that wasn't allowed to subcontract the essay writing to you, then she might have survived the issue.  She didn't, which suggests either that she was a marginal candidate, or that she doubled down in ways that made the school believe they didn't want to be associated with her.\n\nThe school made that decision, not you.

I notice nothing is in here about that girls home life and income. \"She was the only person to get into college\" seems to imply a bit of \"couldn't go to college with out it.\" Maybe there is validity to calling out a cheater: but nothing about this seems noble to me.

They may have already decided that they'd never cheat or plagiarise again but for some reason the pressure made them stupid and they regret it deeply.\n\nEven if its in a bad light I still think that one part of their submission vs their entire academic career should have warranted a talk and that you'd let it slide and they'd lose a friend but that should they ever cheat again then you'd used the evidence to prove they cheated to get in. The friend may have plagiarised the essay but I don't feel OP saw them as much of a friend back to not even talk to them about it. I understand the frustration when someone gets rewarded for your work and there is an integrity aspect but they would have also sunk or swam once there so it would have shown whether they earned their place or not. I feel by getting an athletic scholarship as well that they definitely deserved it, people are human and make mistakes and I think the punishment very much outweighs it.\n\nTotally agree with what you said about how it just feels wrong that everyone is congratulating this friend losing their academic future without even getting to say their side.", ">She destroyed the future of her friend without thinking once or talking to her and you are all there congratulating her.\n\nDepending on the college/Uni, Op could've gotten in trouble as well as some colleges/Universities don't allow plagiarism at all and if someone gets caught plagiarising off of someone else then both people are accountable.\n\n>You are actually telling me she deserves to be stripped of everything because she used her friend's essay\n\nShe stole her essay.\n\n>Her friend had an ACADEMIC AND ATHLETIC scholarship\n\nI don't know much about scholarships but if she did have one, then wouldn't the college want to keep her on, so wouldn't they give her more time and help with her essay.\n\n> we have all cheated in some kind of ways in our lives\n\nYes, but most likely not in a way that puts a friends academic future at risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the Uni that I go to, plagiarism is strictly frowned upon with zero tolerances (but is dependent on the lecturer).

Thankfully, I was able to show that she copied mine as I had started it two months prior to her and her assignment was lacking quite a bit of info needed for the assignment.\n\nThe lecturer that had assigned the assignment was really cool about it and let me keep mine but she had to redo hers, but told us that they would take up with their department head if it happens again where as any other lecturer would immediately take it up with the head of the department and we would've been given disciplinary actions (getting a failing mark, being removed from the course).", "Tia wasn\u2019t the person the university accepted.

We had to write short stories 3 days a week as part of the lesson. After we turned in the assignments, the professor would choose a few and read them to the class. The writing was labor-intensive, often taking hours. It was hard coming up with a topic, and then writing a story that reflected the type of writing style the professor wanted for that lesson (contrast/comparison, etc.), using correct grammar and spelling, etc. This was before there was Microsoft Word; and I only had an electric typewriter, not a word processor. Anyhow, the professor read one student's short story and I knew that I had heard the story before. Another classmate who was taking the English Comp I class, who I went to high school with, approached me after class and said, \"I heard that story before.\" We remembered hearing the story in an English class in our high school and we went to the professor and told her. She looked into it and we learned about the seriousness of plagiarism in our next class. The student who plagiarized was kicked out of the class. I'm not sure if she was kicked out of the college all together.", "I was so terrified of being accused of plagiarism I kept all of my handwritten notes and plans and reference lists for a full academic year.

NTA.", ">they didn't even try and find out the reason why they used their essay makes me lean more to YTA or you both suck.\n\nThe reason doesn't change what they did. This is a college application essay, not some petty theft for baby food. What's the excuse that makes it okay? Clearly she knew there was a timeline and met it since she was early decision and had a scholarship and the rest of her application. There are things Tia could have done but she chose plagiarism, fully and completely. There aren't many mitigating factors for her on this. The best kind of mitigating factor for not meeting a college application timeline would be some kind of tragic family event, but in that case you either talk to the University about your timeline and personal hardship or you just wait a semester or a year at worst. There's just no good excuse for literally submitting someone else's paper as your own.\n\n>There may have been so much pressure on them that they thought their genuine essay just wasn't good enough even though they had written one, they just panicked at the submission time and tweaked OPs in a last minute self confidence meltdown..\n\nThat's not a good excuse though, that demonstrates bad judgement and bad decision-making.\n\n>they maybe regretted it and were ashamed but were in too deep.\n\n\"In too deep?\" With plagiarizing their friend's college application letter? Hoo boy, I worry about where your own judgement is.\n\n>They may have already decided that they'd never cheat or plagiarise again but for some reason the pressure made them stupid and they regret it deeply.\n\nSo? There's no way for anyone to know this. Lots of people also do things that are bad/wrong/hurt people, then say they are sorry and it'll never happen again and they do it again. But there are arguably at least 3 entities being wronged here: OP, the University, and other potential scholarship recipients. Have they all decided to forgive Tia? Obviously not.\n\n>should have warranted a talk and that you'd let it slide and they'd lose a friend but that should they ever cheat again then you'd used the evidence to prove they cheated to get in.\n\nThis is silly, because, again, OP is not the only entity being wronged, not to mention OP could potentially be ij trouble of plagiarizing herself if somehow the two essays were read by someone else, so that's a risk to OP.\n\nTia only cheated herself and she did not do it in a non-harmful way. Cheating to pass a difficult final exam through, say, hiding clever notes might be unethical, but it's resourceful and the real world rarely if ever requires you to perform your duties without any notes and in such a controlled and timed environment, not to mention nobody else is at risk of being caught up in the cheating. This, however, was clearly a calculated theft of another person's work and presented as her own.

Which probably ends up making her realize that she should just put on some effort herself.", "As a physician, I can tell you that Adderall is absolutely a performance enhancing drug, and it will enhance the performance of anyone who takes, regardless of whether or not they have ADD/ADHD.", "I wouldn't call it cheating, but it definitely is a performance enhancing drug. My thinking is that it gives an advantage, but the person taking it is still doing their own work. It's not like it makes them smarter, it just lets them focus. That said, it's dangerous because of its addiction potential.", "Or if you are writing about the same topic in a second class and sound too much like yourself. That one was fun.", "I\u2019m kinda with you on that, there\u2019s something that feels kinda mindless about typing and thinking at the same time when writing.  I usually will do a full outline with pen and paper, and add bullet points for everything I want to cover, and then start typing from there.", "Yup, what the other guy said is correct. You'd have to apply as though you never went to college, forfeiting all of your previous class credits, and hope the new school didn't find out somehow and request an academic transcript anyway.\n\nMost schools use a special code (at my school it was F\\*) to denote that a student failed for an academic integrity violation. Having an F\\* on your academic transcript is basically a poison pill, meaning no other (reputable) school will accept it.", "Yep. A privileged family is definitely NOT something that makes plagiarism less likely\u2026 lmao", "I have friends who are college professors and every semester they have at least one kid who gets caught by the plagiarism detection software.  Sometimes blatant.  One funny one: kid plagiarized a paper from a chapter in an obscure phd thesis.  Turns out the prof had written the thesis 20 years earlier!\n\nOopsie \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I believe he did challenge it (aka why he got unbanned from campus, I think) but because the notice was so late I dont think it got done in time for him to start the new semester. He was well known for not really getting great grades though, but that applies to plenty of students, honestly I didnt really know him well so everything ive heard is coming from other classmates. Where I live (Denmark) we dont really have many universities so theres not really a large amount of competition between schools - I dont think Ive ever seen a school here advertise with the high grades/amount of passed students they have. Of course they do want students to pass though, but in this situation I think there was a lack of empathy from someone higher up. Its not really the first time ive experienced my university being kinda stubborn in exam related situations", "My comment was supposed to go to the guy above you, not sure why it went to you.", "Especially if they are performing in a masturbation and/or cleaning contest.", "Still not cheating", ">and it will enhance the performance of anyone who takes, regardless of whether or not they have ADD/ADHD.\n\nIt made my son violent and uncontrollable.", "Idk. My son is on concerta, and one thing he observed is that it makes him worse at some things. He's better at school, but when he's assembling a complicated lego thing he tends to not catch his mistakes until far later, so he ends up having to re-do quite a bit of it. So he'd rather not take it on weekends, even if that makes him a bit off-chops.\n\nI guess that might apply to academia as making him worse at exams but better at coursework. Certainly I made up for my shitty coursework by steamrolling the exams, but everyone's brain is different", "Doesn't hurt any less watching someone get accepted to a school you wanted to go to and they don't even accept that offer. Happened to me and another kid who applied to Howard. My teacher was so mad I didn't accept Howard and went to some dumbass college in the Midwest. Wish I understood back then how prestigious Howard is and how much the Midwest sucks as an international student from a huge city with no available transportation.", "Oh I thought I was the only one! Hurray!", "Interesting! I have always wanted to visit Denmark, it looks like such a beautiful country. I did some work proofreading and copy editing a Danish website translation into English for an HE institution which was a lot of fun. But yeah, the situation in the U.K. is very different with massive competition between institutions for students. Interesting stuff and nice to chat \ud83d\ude3a", "Ahhh I was confused like, 'why are you agreeing with me so snarkily?' Lol", "My creativity just completely disappears on my ADHD meds. I can't solve the most simple problems when on it.", "You too! Honestly sounds like interesting work, ive considering going a more academic route in the future multiple times. Definitly very different environments, though ill admit it sounds kinda nice having as large of a variety of universities as the UK or other countries have (tuition aside that is lol)", "ITS FUCKEN CROWNING", "Pregnant pause ...", "A good way to see if you like the environment is to join the admin teams and see what you think, you could always go for a more academic route after that if you like the HE environment. Personally I loved working in HE, and yes, lots of institutions to choose from with a lot of cross-pollination with both academic and admin staff. Take care and happy new year!
