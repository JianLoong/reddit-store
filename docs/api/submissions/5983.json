I was happy for her until recently. \n\nI was talking to a mutual friend of ours and she started gushing about how Tia\u2019s essay was so heartfelt and beautiful. I asked to see it because I thought she had just forgotten to show me (she showed me many of her essay drafts). But as I was reading it, I was completely taken aback. The essay was one of MY college essay drafts which I\u2019d shown to Tia for reference on writing TECHNIQUES ONLY. I made this clear. \n\nI was livid. The essay was really personal, and she barely even tweaked it up. It was almost entirely copied and pasted. I trusted her with it, and this is what she did. \n\nIn a fit of rage, I gathered all the evidence of me helping her with the college process, including evidence of me sending the specific essay to her, and I showed it to the school. She not only lost her scholarship, but she also lost her seat in the school. \n\nNow, people are calling me dramatic and shaming me for robbing her of her education. She\u2019s the only person in her family to get into college and receive an academic and athletic scholarship, so everyone was rooting for her, including me at one time. And while I didn\u2019t expect the outcome to be so severe, it was. \n\nRight now, I feel bad. I feel terrible. I feel like she took advantage of me, but I didn\u2019t want to be the cause of something so horrible. I did myself a justice, but at the cost of someone\u2019s dreams.

Plagiarizing is a huge deal and colleges take it very seriously.

I understand that not everyone really 'gets' it and you're coming in for a lot of flack, but the truth is, academic integrity is *important*. It's not just that she stole from you (which matters), or that she took a spot someone more deserving could get (which also matters). It's also that if it works once, people tend to do it again - and again, and again.\n\nIn their best case scenario, it might be years before it gets found out if it ever does, but it means that any of their professional or academic success is not based on their own skill and learning but someone else's, which has strong implications for the quality of their work and how it may affect other people's lives. Think about it this way: do you want the architect designing your house to be a plagiarist? They can't just lift bits from one design to fit into another; they have to genuinely know how the pieces fit together and how to convert them so they can work together.\n\nDo you want the surgeon operating on your liver to have cheated their way through medical school? The old joke is, what do you call the med student who graduates at the bottom of their class - you call them doctor. \n\nPlagiarists tend to see what they do as a victimless crime, but the truth is that it isn't. Ask any academic fighting to prove that their work stolen was in fact stolen. Almost as bad, the plagiarist is stealing their own chance of improving their own work and abilities from themselves.\n\nYou did not do this to her. She did this to herself. If her dreams were so important to her, she should have tried to attain them without trying to steal yours from you. I'm sure you would have helped her directly - had she asked.

Did this happen last year?  Even with early acceptance and a ridiculously early scholarship offer, the wheels seemed to turn remarkably fast for OP to turn in all this evidence and for the school to make a decision to take away everything from OP\u2019s friend. 3) Do schools really take unsolicited \u201cevidence\u201d from third parties and just go with it as the absolute truth?\n\nEdited a typo.", "While I think the \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is bullshit and overstated you\u2019re right to be mad at her. \n\nI would have first confronted her about it and told her she needed to be honest instead of snitching. \n\nHowever, she does need to realize she can\u2019t steal and get rewarded for it.", "In all honesty (and I will probably be unpopular for this opinion) I will go with ESH. \n\nShe cheated so was in the wrong.

For a college, plagiarism is not tolerated, and you snitched on her plagiarizing an essay, which is why she predictably lost everything. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, what she did was wrong and makes her an AH. But as a friend, I would never snitch on my friend on an already cutthroat, biased and unfair admissions process that doesn\u2019t affect me in any way.

Not going to be popular, but college acceptance is scamfuckery cheating or not. I think the only thing here is breach of trust. That\u2019s shitty, but showing it to the school is also shitty. There\u2019s an argument to be made that it could be even shittier depending on what you value. \n\nThey had an opportunity, and now it\u2019s gone. I think the value of that scholarship and college acceptance to them is worth more than a betrayal of trust in your end. Does that make it right? No. It doesn\u2019t. But I also don\u2019t think it is necessarily justice to take away that persons opportunity, because actual justice would be everybody gets the education that they deserve, and colleges inherently don\u2019t serve that anyway. \n\nI\u2019ll also lay out my bias. I would not be mad if friend did this, with my consent. That consent would be contingent on them admitting to it if either were caught. I feel in that instance they probably wouldn\u2019t risk it either, and I probably wouldn\u2019t either. But that\u2019s the only instance I would let that happen. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything necessarily morally wrong about cheating a system of an essential need (education) that is exclusionary by default. However that is my bias.", "Yes yes you are the asshole. But so was she for using it without asking. You lost nothing by her copying it and gained nothing by turning her in.

No way, nope, everyone does their own work everytime for sure, such a moral-driven place universities are...and don't get me started on work place where also no one ever copies from the next guy, no way", "Thank you! Integrity matters A LOT", "I doubt she will ever look back on this as a lesson k lj earned. Tia is going to hold this against OP until the day she departs this world", "No? Did it post twice?", "It isn't unsolicited if someone has evidence. A person (OP) writing the essay previously, and letting her friend use it as a reference for writing her own essay, is evidence. \n\nIt doesn't matter how long the process takes. I've seen students apply for aid and it takes months, on the inverse it took me just a couple of weeks for mine to get approved. Likewise the process for discharging someone can be very fast. \n\nWhat I don't understand is how you can be so horrible at reading comprehension that you missed all of that.", ">But unless you were applying to the same college, this didn\u2019t affect you in any way\n\nExcept in the whole violation of trust department.", "I've had my work plagiarized in a graduate program. It definitely affected me. It felt gross and like a violation, plus infuriating that someone else tried to take credit for MY work and MY experience. It was insulting and they obviously did not respect me. It was also stupid because there were only about 20 people in the program, making it even easier to detect.\n\nThe stakes were different because we were already in the program, but yes, it does affect the person it was stolen from in other ways. It's not the other person's work, and it's not their story to tell. \n\nI don't know any college program that wouldn't punish plagiarism. It's in every syllabus. *Because it's wrong*. It is a form of theft and fraud. Nothing justifies it or giving someone a pass. It might be understandable, but it's not justifiable. \n\nIn a way, Tia committed a form of identity fraud by claiming someone else's story as her own. \n\nOP is 1000% NTA.", "The girl stole someone else's essay to steal an admission spot from another student, and as if that wasn't good enough tried to steal a full ride scholarship from a more deserving student. Universities do not take these kinds of things lightly, which is why the girl lost everything. OP didn't do it to her; she did it to herself.", "The girl tried to steal a scholarship from another student by stealing an essay from OP. That's shitty. Reporting it so an honest, deserving student gets the scholarship is the right thing to do.", "Costing her tens of thousands?  It didn't cost her a cent.  The scholarship she stole belonged to the runner-up, not her, so she would have had to pay that anyway.", "Totally disagree.  She knew this was not her essay.  Actions have consequences and sometimes people have to learn the hard way.  \n\nShe ruined her own future by submitting something that was not hers and lying on her application.  It\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault.  She didn\u2019t ask OP for permission to use her essay, why does OP have an obligation to talk to her about it after the fact?  OP worked just as hard to get into college and write THAT essay!  \n\nPlagiarism is wrong and technically OP could\u2019ve sued her for stealing her work!  An author would certainly do that if someone plagiarized their work!  Just because it was a friend doesn\u2019t give her a \u201cfree pass\u201d.  In fact, because it was a friend who was actually trying to help her apply and giving her help with how to write an essay, that makes it that so much worse!\n\nThis girl not only plagiarized an essay to fraudulently gain admission and a scholarship to college but even worse, she betrayed the trust of a great friend that was trying to help her in the first place!", "I disagree. OP didn't ruin anything, Tia's own actions did. It's better that Tia learns how harshly colleges treat plagiarism now than in the middle of the semester after wasting her scholarship money.", "I disagree with your judgment, but I understand your reasoning.\n\nPersonally speaking, I think it's better to nip this in the bud now rather than have OPs friend face more devastating consequences later on. It's far worse to have OP's friend get caught plagiarizing in the middle of her studies and have all of that time and money wasted rather than never getting to waste it to begin with. \n\nAnd she would get caught, because if OP let it slide then she's reinforcing this dishonest approach to college by teaching her she can get away with outright theft of other people's work.", "'Hey so I know that your friend stole from you, cheated and betrayed your trust, but also you suck for being mad about it and taking action'. \n\nThis makes no sense to me.", "I guess honesty is just a neat concept but shouldn\u2019t really be expected.  Look at it this way - she stole a scholarship from someone else who didn\u2019t cheat.", "What? Are you for real? OP is in no way an asshole. This girl legally signed when she submitted her application package that she was the author of the essay, and that her application was complete with no errors or falsehoods. By submitting someone else\u2019s essay, she effectively showed the application committee that not only was she not capable of writing an essay, but that she\u2019s a cheat as well. Plagiarism is severely punished in academia. \n\nOP gained nothing from any of this but could have lost out. What if OP had applied to the same university with her essay that she wrote, and been denied bc this kid stole her essay and submitted it? There is no excuse for being lazy and a cheat, especially when OP was trying to help her.\n\nEdited a word.", "Well, she clearly lost trust in her friend after they copied it.", "Unless those essays were ever added to one of the plagiarism databases and OP's academic integrity was brought into question.", "She didn\u2019t win that scholarship since she didn\u2019t write the essay that won the scholarship. OP did. She chose her actions and chose to cheat, she got caught, now she faces consequences.", "She cheated her way into the scholarship and stole \"hundred if not thousands of dollars\" from the person next-in-line. OP rightfully returned the scholarship to its true owner.", "She lost her scholarship to someone else that, hopefully, didn\u2019t plagiarize. She lost her scholarship because of her own actions, and now hopefully someone that put in the actual effort it took to get that scholarship earns it.", "Sorry, but this is just CYA for OP. If they tried using their own essay in the future and the other was uploaded to a one of the many anti plagiarism databases it could cost her big time.", "Lose a scholarship she stole in the first place?  \n\nImagine how you'd feel if you'd been the runner-up.", "No OP didn't cause her to lose the scholarship. She lost it herself when she stole OPS essay and submitted it as her own. She tried to steal the scholarship from another student, who more than likely didn't steal an essay.", "The essay didn't have to be the reason for the scholarship to get her booted. They make it VERY VERY clear what plagerism is and the consequences for it and they take it very seriously. There's zero chance they expelled this friend just on anyone's word.", "Even if the essay isn\u2019t the sole decider for the scholarship, she still plagiarized part of her application, meaning she tried to cheat the system. Hopefully, someone that did put in genuine effort gets the scholarship. (Idk, but I\u2019m a strong believer that if you genuinely want something like this and you have all the capability to try, you should try YOUR best to work towards the future you want, not steal from others). \n\nAlso, what would speaking to her friend do? Her friend made her choice, and you can\u2019t just go back and ask to resubmit your application AFTER receiving the award. Her friend was 100% aware of what she had done.\n\nETA: also, I remember sharing my college essays with friends when I was in high school for the sole purpose of getting someone to proof read. I feel like that is 100% normal, as long as it\u2019s clear about the intentions.", "What makes you think Tia doesn't exist?", "Found the friend LOL", "If her university noticed they both had the same parts of their application without one of them stepping forward, OP could have been framed for cheating.\n\nSecond, some friend Tia is for putting them both in this situation.", "LOL, she robbed the runner-up applicant of a deserved scholarship.  Put yourself in that person's shoes and see how just you feel it is.", "OR! Play stupid games, win stupid prizes\u2026..", "I'm not a lifelong academic and I care about this shit. Cheats and thieves shouldn't get scholarships.", "Lol you seem guilty about something, want to share?", "She doesn\u2019t deserve that, and I doubt this would make having any academic career completely impossible. But OP is still NTA, because their work was plagiarized, and even worse, secretly done so by the person the HELPED get into college. OP\u2019s friend DOES deserve to be held accountable.", "Most people don\u2019t cheat.  It\u2019s interesting that you assume they do.    Why is that?", "She can still apply to other universities, perhaps enrol in the second semester. Online Universities and community colleges could be used to get course credits until then. This doesn't mean that Tia has lost her spot at every tertiary education place forever, only the one she decided to cheat. I'm going to sound like every parent/teacher/after-school-special ever but: she not only cheated the uni with her stunt, she cheated her friend the OP who helped her, the applicants up against her, her family who believed in her and she cheated herself. If she had only believed in herself maybe her own essay who have been enough, but now she will never know if she could have got in to her dream school on her won merit. She has also pretty much burnt bridges with anyone involved in ever thinking she is trustworthy, at least in the near future because of her own stupid actions. This isn't looking over a friend's research paper to see their reference list and use their sources in high school or copying maths quiz answers in primary school, this is a big deal and academic integrity at a university level is to be taken seriously, especially in this day and age of misinformation, fake news and conspiracy theories.", "Not if you cheat", "This is completely false. It\u2019s a college essay based on a prompt, unrelated to merit. Obviously the grades were already there. Plus she was an athlete which makes getting into college very easy.", "Sadly it happens way too often and this is why it is treated as very bad.  It is poor work on the part of the person doing the copying.", "Most who do so are smart enough to not just simply copy and paste something.", "Universities know that plagiarism happens.  That is why they clamp down on it hard anytime they find it.\n\nI\u2019m confused by your comment on workplaces.  You do know that workplaces are collaborative and that it doesn\u2019t generally matter who does what, right?  If someone copies my text and sends it to a client, and the client likes it, then hurrah!  We made a client happy and the company gets money to pay us with!", "NTA.  No one is suggesting that people never plagiarize. Of course they do. If people didn\u2019t do it, there\u2019d be no need for rules against it. That doesn\u2019t make it right, ok, acceptable or nbd. If colleges didn\u2019t care, they wouldn\u2019t have rules against and no one would ever be penalized for doing it.\n\nTia fucked around and found out. I have zero sympathy for her.", "'Hey so this shitty thing happens a lot, so therefore it's okay' is bad logic.", "I thought someone posted this same exact scenario over a year ago?! Hmm. Very strange", "I didn\u2019t miss any of it. I just don\u2019t believe it happened.", "If the plagiarism was discovered in a different manner, OP also could\u2019ve faced academic discipline up to and including expulsion - so even past the dishonesty, friend could have ROYALLY fucked OP when she did nothing but attempt to help in an honest manner. \n\nFriend played stupid games, won stupid prizes by cheating so close to her finish line.", "Not only that, but she was offered a free ride over other applicants while using someone else\u2019s work without permission. There were far more deserving students that could and will use the money. The difference: those students did their own work and will get in based on their own merit.", "I totally get that. That\u2019s not what I was saying though.\n\nThe essay didn\u2019t single-handedly win her the scholarship, though. \n\nI still would have talked to her first.", "Because people are fallible and making mistakes is part of life. This sub loves to hold onto one fact and then damn that person to eternity. I would have spoken to her, asked why she did it, told her how I felt about it\u2026and then we could have decided on what to do \u2018either you tell them or I will\u2019 or even something different. \n\nMe personally? I wouldn\u2019t have said anything to the school. First in her fam to go to school and with a full ride? Yeah, it\u2019s not great but she didn\u2019t murder anyone. And i couldn\u2019t live with myself knowing I destroyed someone\u2019s life that hard. And yeah, you or someone else will say \u2018but she chose to destroy it herself\u2019, and that is technically true and a very valid opinion. But I personally wouldn\u2019t be able to do that.", "The timeline is preposterous; that\u2019s the biggest reason.", "Do you think colleges are comparing application essays year after year? There literally is no situation that OP was put in.", "Fuck em.", "Yep. Like a six figure career built on a piece of paper obtained with purchased essays and the cooperation of professors who willingly ate up all my bullshit just because I was friendly with them and could hold my own during office hours.", "no no no no, you misunderstand. u/rwecardo CANNOT be guilty of anything because *clearly* as soon as multiple people do something wrong, it IMMEDIATELY becomes totally acceptable for everyone to do it.  \n\n\n/s in case that wasn't clear.", "I think we found Tia", "Maybe not guilty but not versed in the importance of actual academic honesty as a driver of all trust in the system?", "They don't?

She tried to help a friend by giving her examples similar to anything she could\u2019ve found on the internet.

Actions have consequences whether they be good or bad!

This was on purpose, and knowing what plagiarism is and how to not do it is something thought from early elementary school.\n\nPutting the \u201ceither you tell them or I will\u201d would still produce the same result.
