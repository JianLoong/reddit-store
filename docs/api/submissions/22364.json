I think it might be difficult in the fist place to separate his brothers and give them gifts privately because his brothers live with the step siblings. Even if you did give the gifts privately they still would know you did because they all live together and probably would still be mad.

That\u2019s wrong. It would be one thing if it was their birthday but this wasn\u2019t. You should have given it to them in private.\n\nETA-I just found out you lied about what\u2019s traditional for family to do in Poland. Troll bait post.", "YTA for giving the gifts infront of your step siblings especially the younger two. Now  if you don't have a good relationship with them I  understand but not infront of all them.", "[deleted]", "Hey! You young adults who are all over the age of 18? Let\u2019s go grab a drink because I have some birthday gifts to give you guys", "OP\u2019s dad marrying their mom doesn\u2019t make them family to OP.", "NTA - but in saying that, it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to give them something small. Then again, they probably still wouldn\u2019t have been happy.", "NTA. You're under no obligation to buy anyone anything.", "NTA not even half siblings Who are these strangers to demand gifts just because daddy is having sex with mommy?", "NTA I have step siblings too, and we don't buy eachother gifts. You choose who you want to give a gift to, and if anyone has a problem with that, just inform them that their entitlement isn't going to pay for a gift.", "NTA just point out that since you pay for your brothers, their parents have more money for daughters. And 10 years old doesn\u2019t need MacBook for school", "Dude you are an incredible brother . Good for you . Love the first line of your second paragraph. Keep up good work. I\u2019m guessing nobody got you nice stuff!", "Yes YTA.\nNot for not getting the steps gifts but for giving such HUGE gifts in front of children and then being baffled that there are strong hurt feelings.", "NTA you can spend your money on what you want and you want to help your brothers through school. I would get them a secure lockbox for the laptops especially if the others are malicious.", "This is so blatantly fake it's hilarious. The daily \"step family bad :(\" fake post needed an *obscure* country to happen in but OP didn't even try to do any research.\n\nAlso there are some good private universities in Poland so someone going to one wouldn't mean anything but if I hear that an entire family is studying at those (while most of public ones are better and free) I would assume they're all dumb unless proven otherwise.", "NTA.. the entitlement of these people", "NTA", "NTA - I presume your father doesn't provide enough electronics for them all and you were helping out.  His is acting as though he hsa 6 children not 4  , its a quesiton of perspective", "There are university fees at public ones, you need to pay a recruitment fee to get the paperwork done (this is how my teachers explained them to me when I asked why I need to pay just for them to look on my application) but I agree this is a buzzard tradition of sharing money", "Not as if there was a different option... Where do u want him to give them the gifts?  And even after that... what? U expect em to hide the fact that they got gifts from their older brother? It would be pretty much the same thing even if he didn't do it there", "He gives it in secret, they still see it. Now he is hiding because \"he did something wrong\".\n\nNope.", "its next to nothing compared to whatever is the USA, or GB, or even dutch university tuition.

Based on the age of the youngest step sister, the father and his \"new\" wife have likely been together as a couple (at least publicly/known to the children) for less than 10 years so there's not even a reason for OP to think of children of his father's new wife as anything other than her children to whom he has a casual, if any, relationship", "YTA only because underage children (step-siblings) are involved.  You don't owe anybody anything but doing something for them (not necessarily equivalent) would be a kind thing to do.  Kindness can never be overrated.  Perhaps tickets to a 'family' event that mom, dad and step kids can go to.   Don't expect a 14 year old and 10 year old to understand your complicated relationship with your dad.  They are kids.  Be kind.", "Their being mad doesn't make them right.\n\nNTA. They aren't your relatives in any real sense. Step-sibling is just a legal term, not a blood term.\n\nYou don't owe them anything. It sounds as if you don't care for them much, either. Why are so many people on this site doing the gimmee gimmee dance? Let their own siblings give them gifts.", "Yeah, the fact that these very generous gifts were given with the stepsiblings present tips this into an ESH. That was just rude on the OP's part.", "I think there\u2019s a different energy to giving gifts in private and people seeing them later, and selective gifting (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with OP\u2019s behaviour to be clear) in front of everyone.", "The terms are you will all eventually share your wealth with those 3 people.

It\u2019s your money and you can choose how you spend it \n\nHowever, can you recall what it was like to be that young? Morally, not bringing your step-siblings gifts just shows you don\u2019t care about them at all. Like, not even a tiny bit. These kids didn\u2019t ask for this situation, so just imagine how it makes them feel. And then being told they\u2019re not really siblings\u2026heartbreaking.

NTA for not buying them anything but you didn\u2019t have to lavish them with absurdly expensive gift in front of everyone you didn\u2019t get a gift for .. and I suspect you know what you were doing and it was on purpose. In the future do it separately not for dad and step\u2026 they\u2019re adults but the younger kids and teenagers", "While this is true, it gives OP class in that he's not doing it in feoj of.their faces. They will see it slowly over the course of the day.\n\nIt's a private gift, not one that's in your face."]}
