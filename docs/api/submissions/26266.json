I do however have a bf (21m) we\u2019ve been living together for 4 months and his sister just got married this last Saturday. The next day I\u2019m FaceTiming my mom and telling her how two of the relatives were joking talking about how they were already planning my and bf\u2019s wedding. My mom laughs then eventually brings up how she wants a dance with my brother at my wedding. Me, unsure of what she means, says she can dance with him and whoever she wants to, but no. Apparently she means she wants her own special/separate dance (think father and bride, mother and groom etc) with my brother to perform for me and my future husband as well as our families. My mom really likes dancing, she was never professional or anything, it\u2019s just something she\u2019s kinda passionate about. As sweet as I think that is, that\u2019s just not something I want/feel comfortable with. It\u2019s my wedding, not my brothers. I\u2019ll already be doing the father and bride dance with her in place of my dad as I do not have a relationship with him. I explained how this all makes me uncomfortable and how that doesn\u2019t seem like a normal thing. She tries to convince me that it is and other people do it. Even if it is normal, it\u2019s not something I want. She then goes on about how I\u2019m being disrespectful with how I constantly tell her no to these kinds of things, how I\u2019m not keeping my family in consideration enough, I don\u2019t think of how my actions impact them, and \u201che\u2019s your fucking brother\u201d. Now she\u2019s going on about cultural things that I don\u2019t want at my wedding and I\u2019m disrespectful about that too. I tried telling her politely that it\u2019s my wedding, she can dance with whoever she wants when everyone else dances, and I\u2019m sorry she feels that way but at the end of the day, it\u2019s mine and my future fianc\u00e9\u2019s choice. She didn\u2019t like that either. Of course, I\u2019m not even engaged yet, I know I have time, and yes I plan on including both her and my culture but within the boundaries of myself and my future fianc\u00e9. Still I can\u2019t help but wonder if I could have been more polite or done a better job at making her feel more important/included.

She's a narcissist asshole. It doesn't matter what other people do. This isn't other people's wedding - it's your wedding, and you get to choose how to celebrate.\n\nIf cringey dances for particular couples while everyone else looks on are your thing, then do that. If you don't want that, don't do that.  If you like bits of the culture you have inherited, use them. If you don't like then, don't.

But this whole thing is ridiculous, why are you even having this type of argument with your mother?  You\u2019re not even engaged. Four months of living together does not make an engagement-get to know each other first.  Good luck with mom-you\u2019re going to need it when you do get engaged.", "NTA. Good grief. First, stop engaging with her on these topics- if she brings it up, remind her it is a non issue given that you\u2019re not engaged. And if she pushes, just reiterate that you will have an entire other family\u2019s culture and traditions to incorporate into your wedding in addition to your own, and therefore not everyone will get what they want, but that there is no use being upset about it since you\u2019re not even engaged yet! \n\nHonestly, I\u2019d encourage you to elope - if your mom is making wedding planning miserable before you even have a fianc\u00e9 I can\u2019t imagine she won\u2019t find a way to suck the joy out of it entirely the moment you do get engaged.", "Take this as a warning - she is going to try to make your wedding about herself as much as possible.

Your mother is already getting the mother daughter dance and she wants a second with your brother so she can get more stage time than the bride. Yikes.", "Nta. It is strange to have dances for people who aren\u2019t getting married lol. Very strange indeed. Now let\u2019s have the cousins dance to this song. Everyone stand back and watch.

And this is apparently happening only four months into your relationship, at age 21.", "NTA. Weddings are meant to be about the couple, and what *they* want, not what other family members want.  If her and your brother having a special dance would make you uncomfortable, you are well within reason to tell her that's not going to happen.

You may want to consider keeping her out of the planning process and definitely don't have her pay for it or she will use that as leverage to get her way.", "NTA - What the actual heck?

I suspect if you look at r/raisedbynarcissists you'll find stories that feel familiar to you.\n\nWhen the time comes, do not involve your mother in your wedding planning at all - she'll try to insist on having everything she wants and will ruin your joy in getting to design your own wedding.  Don't tell her your vendor names.  Warn your vendors about your mom and have them put passwords on your account.  Have it in the contract with your DJ that he only plays the playlist you've agreed to, and only gives the microphone to the list of names you've given him in writing ahead of time.  If he plays a requested song or gives the microphone to anyone else he doesn't get the balance of his payment. This will help ensure your mom doesn't fool him into being her pawn.\n\nMaybe do one wedding dress shopping trip with your mom, but view it in your mind as a day of trying on dresses for fun with Mom.  Not a real dress shopping day.  Don't go to the stores you're serious about with her; visit those with trusted friends instead who will help you find a dress you'll love.\n\nMom has to send you a photo of her dress before buying it to get your approval.  Because she sounds like the type to buy a full blown wedding dress or something over the top to try to get all the attention to herself.\n\nDon't spend time stressing about all this right now.  Just copy all the good ideas from here into a notes file on your phone so when the day comes that you do get engaged you'll be prepared.", "NTA.
