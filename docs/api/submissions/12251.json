You are correct: this was a weird thing for your BF to do if he was secure in y\u2019all\u2019s relationship. I doubt he\u2019d have done the same if your friend was not a man. \n\nI would recommend cooling off and thinking if your relationship with your BF is really what you think it is. If he can\u2019t handle your friendship then I don\u2019t recommend staying in the relationship. \n\nWord of caution: this also sounds a bit controlling of your BF. I would not stand for a partner treating me this way. You have every right to have a day with a friend.", "NTA he ruined your day with his insecurity. You are correct.", "NTA. Your boyfriend behaved atrociously.", "NTA, and your boyfriend sounds horrible.", "NTA and it's time to reconsider this relationship. Following you around to make sure you're not cheating is controlling and a huge red flag. He needs to let you have your own friends and trust you.", "NTA.\n\nYou do not need a chaperone. And your reaction was completely justified.\n\nMore to the point, trust is an essential element in any relationship.  Because if it weren't, you'd essentially have to be joined at the hip to ensure that you don't end up falling into the sack with any man you might happen to encounter during the course of the day. Does he also tag along when you go grocery shopping to ensure you sneak behind the produce section for a quickie with the hot guy you happened to see checking out the melons?\n\nIn your place, I would have told my jealous boyfriend no, he is not coming with us, and if he doesn't trust me, then we need to end things now.\n\nSo, to answer your question, you're absolutely not wrong and your boyfriend doesn't trust you. You are not the AH here and your boyfriend most definitely is. On steroids.\n\nI would suggest you break up and find someone who trusts you enough to handle the fact that you have a male childhood friend.", "Absolutely NTA. That is a huge red flag. Get out.", "NTA. His insecurities are a huge red flag and he literally invited himself because he doesn't trust you. Ask him if he would've reacted that way if your friend was a girl (or gay). The only thing you could've done better is perhaps inviting your friend over to meet your boyfriend shortly after he arrived. That way your boyfriend would've been more chill about it and then you could've planned your entire day. I'd recommend mentioning this to your bf as well; be reasonable with him and then it's really up to him to apologize.", "Nta. Boyfriend being jealous is red flags", "NTA. Boyfriend being a little jealous of a male friend is understandable, especially one that you've known way longer and that he's never met. But that is no excuse for the way he acted. It's not ok that he followed you/forced you to let him basically have you under his surveillance and flat out accuse you of cheating on him (or going to go cheat on him). You are totally right that he ruined your day with his insecurity, and the severity of his actions mean he is likely to continue to act this way or worse in the future. I would really think hard about your relationship with him. That's a huge turn off and idk if I'd be able to come back from that.", "NTA, bf sounds controlling", "NTA. Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t trust you.", "Ew girl leave him you deserve better. Trust me he\u2019ll get worse once he sees he can push you around and control you. This is beyond creepy.", "He's the AH an insecure one at that! You know he's never going to let you be friends with this guy... Right? In fact you're never going to be allowed to be friends with any guy as long as this boyfriend is in the picture. I'm sure you know it's time to get rid of him.", "NTA - stories like this always make me wonder how many other red flags are flying on a daily/weekly basis that are just being ignored. A controlling, insecure individual does just decide to act on those feelings out of the blue, they do it constantly and compulsively. \n\nI don't need to know anything else about this guy to be able to guarantee you that there are better people out there. After the breakup, treat yourself to a spa day to make up for the one that was ruined.", "ESH. I know everyone is calling this guy out for his \"insecurities\", but I have to ask...if the shoe was on the other foot, how would you feel? Your boyfriend talked daily to a childhood friend who was a female. You've never met her, and don't know much except she's coming into town and taking your boyfriend to a spa for the day. Most spa outings are generally romantic couples experiences, so does that not seem off?\n\nWhy didn't you take the time to introduce your bf to this guy? If he's such a great friend, why not bring him to hang out first with the guy you've been seeing for 2 years? Like the three of you go out so he can get to know your friend. It's common sense and could have been huge. He sucks for being insecure, you suck for giving him a reason to be, and doing nothing to mitigate that.", "I just know that if the roles were reversed everyone would say YTA and that OP has feelings for his friend. Y\u2019all are hypocrites", "NTA. I\u2019d be pretty pissed having him follow me around all day to make sure I don\u2019t cheat. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, BF\u2019s actions were pure AH material. If, however, he had taken an approach like, \u2018um, look, this just makes me uncomfortable. Your best MALE friend is traveling across national boundaries to be with you\u2026AND you\u2019ve scheduled a whole day with him. You are free to do whatever you want, but I can\u2019t deal with this set-up\u2026we\u2019re done\u2019\u2026well, that approach I would understand. (Yes, I saw your other post that said BF is gay.
