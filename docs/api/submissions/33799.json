It\u2019s really exhausting (and rather expensive bc it\u2019s a holiday) so I paid 5\u20ac extra to have a preferred seat at the window - I find it more comfortable, especially since my plan was to sleep for a big part of the trip. \n\nAt the second stop (Prague) a couple (around 40) came to my seat and asked if I would be willing to move so they could sit together. \n\nI kindly explained that, no, I will not move bc I paid extra and would like to stay seated. \n\nThe woman\u2019s expression turned sour and she asked why. \n\nI, again, said that I booked this seat specifically. That I would like to sleep and it\u2019s more comfortable to sleep if I lay my head against a window rather than sit uncomfortably in an aisle seat.

The bus driver had to came to the back and talk to her bc he couldn\u2019t drive of while she was still standing. In the end she went to her seat and her husband sat next to me.

You are absolutely in the right. That moment when you say no, and the face of the person who just asked you for a favor turns sour and they ask why: pay attention to that moment in the future.

Those are the bullies, and you need to be ready to stand your ground and not give them what they want. Ever. Do not attempt to reason with them, and do not imagine that if only you give them more information, they'll understand and go away quietly.
