You have to take care of yourself first before you can rescue anybody else. You have been slowly drowning this whole time, and now it is do or die. The court can go after your sister for child support. You have done what you can, but it is not your responsibility.  You need to make yourself a priority for a while and then you can reassess the situation and see if there's anything you can do to help.

You need to put on your own oxygen mask first before you can help other people. You are bending over backwards for this immature little ahole of a sister. Why?", "NTA. But the rest of your family are. They turn a blind eye while you starve, suffer & stress yourself to to point of breakdown. The child\u2019s father should be paying support for his child, not you. You are not your mother. The sexism of forcing you into her role is off the scale. Do your father & brother know how much this is harming you? Why aren\u2019t they helping more? As for your sister - she has had more than enough of your goodwill. You do not exist to finance her selfishness. You have your own life too, you shouldn\u2019t have to finance hers to the absolute detriment of yours. I get that your niece is blameless, but the sole financial demands thrown on you are making you ill. It\u2019s time that the rest of the family step up too. This does not make you a bad person.", "NTA. Sister is the devil. I\u2019d suggest talking with your aunt about her getting legal guardianship.", "Why, why, why....WHY ARE YOU PAYING? Where is the \"father\" in all of this? WOW! I take it you are not in America? When you use the term \"uni\"? Do you not have family courts in Europe? Take the father to court! Impute his income! He should be paying for all of these things! Stop giving sis \\*anything\\*! She is a freeloading tramp! Wow!", "Your sister is starving her child? Call an authority. Regardless of whether or not she wanted the child, it IS her responsibility to keep her alive.

YWBTA if you didn't report her to whatever version of child protective services you have wherever you live.", "NTA. You need to take care of yourself. However, your aunt needs to understand exactly what happened financially. Meaning how much you were taken advantage of, and why it needs to stop now. She needs to know to avoid the same manipulation, and why you can no longer contribute. It\u2019s possible that she took the child in only because your sister told her you would be contributing, and she\u2019ll need to be prepared. \n\nThe money you gave your sister is now lost. You will never see it again. So therefore there is no need to dwell on it or stretch this out. Chalk it up as an extremely hard life lesson and never let your sister take from you ever again. This may mean limiting your contact with her. \n\nOnce you are emotionally and financially stable again, if you choose to help your niece, you need to find another channel to do it. Going through your sister is not working. I don\u2019t know much about this area, but I would talk to any lawyers or financial experts that you need to in order to set up a system where the child gets it.

If you feel overwhelmed and angry, it's okay to step away from those bad things and seek to heal yourself.\nI feel that if you and your family need to really help, you need to seek legal counseling for the niece's situation.

At the same time, her wardrobe is constantly changing, she\u2019s constantly going out to expensive restaurants, her hair and nails are always done.

I have to admit that I too have been a very big enabler. Maybe that\u2019s why no one in the family wants to help right now. Her tuition is quite costly but since I could afford it I just decided to pay her fees even though everyone else in the family was against it.

Your sister and her baby daddy would also be on the hook for child support paid to this aunt, which the government would directly garnish from their wages.\n\nIf I were you, I would encourage your aunt to do all of this formally and above board. Think officially registering as a foster parent, getting the neglect and abuse formally documented, filing for child support with the courts, etc.\n\nIt may be tempting for your family not to bother with all of that, but if they don't, not only will your niece and your aunt miss out on that extra money and support, but it makes it very, very easy for your sister to decide to waltz back in and take her daughter back.\n\nSo, encourage your aunt to do the legwork, and help her as she does.\n\nAs for the money thing. It does seem like you've got a lot, now that you've stopped paying for university and daycare. The list of stuff you say you'd be able to do was quite extensive, so this is not a case between you starving or your niece starving. \n\nI think a middle ground is warranted, where you send maybe $100-200 a month to your aunt to help out. This eases the burden a little, (especially if you clearly communicate to your dad and other siblings that they likewise need to contribute) and will keep you from feeling like you are abandoning her. But at the same time the amount is low enough that it will not prevent you from getting therapy, treating yourself, starting investments, etc.\n\nI would never, ever give your sister money again. \n\nIf you are feeling particularly burned and cautious, you can offer to cover an expense directly instead of handing your aunt cash. For example you could send grocery gift cards instead of cash (or, once a month, have your aunt fill a digital grocery cart up to a certain amount, which you pay for and she goes and picks up), or agree to pay the water or internet bill directly for them.", "NTA\n\nYou should be priority number 1. \nStop sending money to your sister.\nIf you still want to send money for your niece then send it to your mom\u2019s sister.", "NtA.

Your father and brother are grown men. They should handle their finances themselves. I find it very weird to help them rather than a helpless child.

You work hard for those money, you deserve to spend it on you. Besides, the kid is now with your aunt, so I'm assuming that there is no longer any financial aids needed? In any cases, I think if you ever need to send, it would be less than what you are now sending + you can now send it directly to your aunt instead.\n\nWhat I worry about more tho is if your sister would try to take back her child when she clearly is not ready.

Don't send your sister a dime ever again.  If you could help your aunt every once in a while it would be nice but you are not obligated and you certainly shouldn't be making monthly payments!  You're not the parents of this child.  Track the loser dad down and file in the court for child support and make sure your sister doesn't get it.", "NTA do what you got to do. In the future, don't get scammed. If you have to send money for you niece pay direct. If you pay for child care be incontact with the nursery or baby sitter. Send money directly to their account. Ensure they know not to let her mom collect refunds for unused days or care (dead beat parents love to do that). They let other people pay the day care then leave their poor kids at home alone while they go and collect refunds. Same with money for clothes and food. Buy it threw a delivery service off of an account in your name and have it sent to their home. Any refund is sent back to you and your account. Medical care. You pay the bill. Never send money to unreliable people. Learn from this experience and never make the same mistake again. Your poor niece. Even though your mom is now caring for her. I suggest you operate like this if you need or want to help your niece. When she starts school send money to her school account or a trusted teacher. Strangers often do better than their own bad parents. It's sad.", "Stop giving her any and all money.", "Are you also supposed to help your brother in university fees too?( is he a minor still)And take care of your father in his old age?

Don\u2019t cut contact if you don\u2019t want to, but don\u2019t answer every msg and phone call. Limit it to once or twice a week and only for a few minutes. Don\u2019t say I don\u2019t want to talk if you hate confrontation, just say you\u2019re busy. Force them to deal with their own problems. I think you have trauma related to how your mother was treated and your anxiety stems from your fear in turning into her ,and with all the sacrifices she made, her life suddenly ended.

You are not a bad person to take care of yourself. You would be an AH if you dump all the care for child off on your aunt but I do not think that is the question you are asking.
