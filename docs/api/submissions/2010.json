You have been very generous with your time and space - letting your parents live in the basement suite, putting up your brother and his wife in your part of the house, and giving the kids gifts every time they visit.\n\nAnd I want to follow up on that last part in detail because it illustrates how much your brother has been taking you for granted. \n\nFirstly, as someone else mentioned, it's his and his wife's job to provide entertainment for their kids, not yours to have toys just lying around in case a kid comes by your house. If the kids were bored, then they should have taken them out for an adventure or suggested something that they and the grandparents could do together, or got out toys/books from their own stash.\n\nSecondly, while a lot of people are nosy enough to stick their heads round the door of an unlocked room they haven't been in, that still doesn't make it right. Especially given that some people's jobs require confidentiality. And that's made worse by his taking something that a) you had actively denied permission for him to use, and b) was brand-new and in a sealed unit. He had no right to do that. It was a betrayal of your trust. It was your office and your belongings, and it does not matter that it happened to be toys he wanted rather than jewellery or electronics - they were still yours to make decisions about and that is the part that matters.\n\nThirdly, your brother has become far too used to your generosity, and it seems to have affected the way he perceives your role in the family. You are not an automated gift dispenser. It is not usual for people to give gifts to visiting children every single time they visit. Children aren't royalty and they don't need gifts for existing. It is not something his children are owed, and neither is it owed to him as their parent. As host, you are already giving them the gift of a place to stay, food to eat, and your time and company (when possible). Gifts aren't usually involved in family visits at all, but when there are gifts involved in the guest-host relationship, it is far more customary for the guests to give their host a gift as thanks and recognition of the life disruption (however welcome) that their extra presence has caused. \n\nHis demanding presents for his children is immensely rude and entitled, and all the more so given that you were generous enough to gift them the Lego sets he took from you *and his kids were happy with that*.", "Yay I found it hehe..

What's the problem?  You're being selfish!\"  NTA", "NTA and you\u2019re handling it well! I\u2019m livid on your behalf, be watchful of the entitled brother, he may only be in it for the gifts. I sincerely hope there\u2019s some reciprocity in this relationship.", "Yeah NTA \n\nNot on the spectrum myself but this completely not okay \n\nLego is expensive af and your family didn\u2019t respect you at all in this situation \n\nYou on the other hand handled this wonderfully in my opinion!", "He asks you a question, you say no. He does it anyway then after you gift him the thing he stole despite not having permission to do so he's mad because the gift isn't grand enough . I mean. Your not punishing the kids cause they were happy anyway and didn't expect anything better you just punished your brother and rightfully so.  He calls you cheap, but at no point did he try to entertain his kids with his money?   All the while they can't just get a motel or air b and b I assume because bro bro is cheap. The projection is thicc. You said you don't even like kids and yet your over here with the intent to buy them nice things why? Cause your the MVP in this family op.  \ud83d\ude05  Your brother sounds super frustrating I am sorry.", "NTA. It\u2019s called consequences. You made your point without creating a scene. Beautifully handled.  Why do some people think they can take someone else\u2019s stuff?", "NTA\n\nThose sets were yours an not your brother's to give away. Your brother is a thief and doesn't fully understand how much time and money goes into them.", "NTA.  Your brother went into your office, and took something that didn't belong to him or his kids.  That's it.  And you were generous enough to let the kids keep what their dad took.  Anything other than \"thank you\" from your brother is out of line.", "NTA because he just stomped all over a boundary you set down like it wasn't even there. Your parents share some of the blame, since they didn't stop him and even told him about the gift they were going to get. I'd think long and hard about whether you ever want to deal with that again, because it will happen again. It's time to start locking your parents out of your space, too.", "NTA Your brother knows very well that you are not punishing his kids for his misdeed, and even if you were it\u2019s still a lesson for him to do better as a dad and brother. I think it was very nice of you to let them keep the lego kits at all. Those are really expensive.", "NTA, the kids are happy, you actually did give them a gift and they liked it! Really you didn't have to give them anything, and honestly the fact that you gave them the Lego kits is pretty considerate since as you specifically said they couldn't have them when asked.\n\nI actually respect that you gave them the Legos after what happened, since *they* didn't take them from you, so really it wasn't the kids fault. Imo you handled it perfectly \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nSounds like he's just pissy because *he* wanted the PS5.", "Next time he's in the area for a visit, tell him to book a hotel room.  You've been very generous with him and he can pound salt.", "I have a problem with your parents and their lack of respect for you and your possessions. I would take issue with your parents and their blas\u00e9 attitude about the whole thing. If your brother comes back for another visit I would insist he visit only your parents' apartment since he can't be trusted.", "NTA. \n\n\u2014 Your brother is just mad because now HE can\u2019t play with the PS5. \n\n\u2014 Your family need to learn some boundaries, including your parents. \n\n\u2014 The presents were for your niece/nephew and they were happy with them. The end.", "if you dont like children why are you nibbling on them?", "NTA you a wonderful human! You are so so generous and caring, he totally screwed himself the kids were happy that's all that matters!", "How is it that you're cheap and spiteful when it is your brother that is staying in your home and taking your \"toys\" rather than buy some for his kids? As for his level of entitlement for his kids gifts, that's laughable. IMHO, this situation ends when brother is told that he and his family is no longer welcome to stay in your home. Now that there are boundaries that he can follow, you can gift what and when you wish. You sound like a great aunt, NTA.", "NTA.  Sounds like you are being fair and the kids don't really care either way. He **stole** from you, he's lucky you just let it lie there. I wonder if your brother is mad about the PS5 because *he* wanted it. I also really don't get his \"cheap\" comment. The fact you even get them gifts outside of holidays is very generous.", "NTA. Your brother had no right to go behind your back and take your things. Just because he considers them \u201ctoys\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that they are okay to be taken when told not to.\n\nIMO your brother is probably pissed about \u201chis kids\u201d not getting a PS5 (he\u2019d probably use it).\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone should\u2019ve mentioned that you had bought PS5s for your niblings. It ruins the surprise for the entire family.", ">He said that I'm punishing them for him taking my toys\n\nlmao, yeah? And so fucking what? Thieves get punished. If you asked your brother if he wouldn't also want a thief who stole something from his house while he was away to get punished, and he said no, he would be lying.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Your brother is for assuming you\u2019d give more gifts, violating your personal space and then calling you names. \n\nMy guess is he wants the PS5.\n\nHe\u2019s entitled and rude.  \n\nLock your office door moving forward.  Better yet, they all stay in basement next time if they can\u2019t respect your belongings and requests.", "Growing up we had a family friend who had an extensive Lego collection, as a kid my parents and the family friend explained that he wouldn\u2019t share the Lego because it was important to him and we understood because as kids we all had toys that were special to us/we didn\u2019t want others playing with.", "Honestly it doesn\u2019t matter why you have legos. You have legos. They are your legos\u2026 and\u2026 legos are expensive.\n\nYour brother was acting very entitled and disrespectful. Please consider a lock on your door for next time DB visits.\n\nYour niece and nephew are happy! You got them some nice gifts after all. I think your brother wanted the PS5.", "This!  The brother wanted that PS5 while the kids were perfectly thrilled with those Legos.", "That is an excellent idea. It's better than getting several less impressive sets.", "Eh. It's not like she's mistreating them. It's not a requirement that every single person must like children. As long as you're not mistreating children what does it matter that you don't like them??", "You really do need a lock on your office, though.  My sympathies, I collect Breyer horses that to the world appear to be plastic toy horses that can withstand children's play.  But to those of us who collect them, some are rare vintage mint condition models.  Others I have owned for 50 years.   I have learned that people do not respect my \"toy collection\" (instead of coins or guns or something, I guess) and do not take my restrictions on handling them seriously.  So when a family is in my living room, my office full of Breyers is locked.  Other people will not get it.  They have no intention of getting it.  Heck, I'm surprised they aren't on Reddit complaining about the mean aunt who won't let the niblings play with her Legos.  Do some prevention.", "You just know he had already bought a bunch of games for it too", "Yeah that's what annoys me when people touch my stuff too. It's that you don't know where it is. You go to grab something and it's not there."]}
