Obviously he\u2019s the AH here, and your parents honestly for not stopping him taking your stuff. Glad you\u2019re not buying gifts for them, and tbh I\u2019d stop buying gifts from them since they clearly see you as a supporter for money/free stuff.

LEGOs are not cheap, first off. The kids were happy. Your brother, who entered YOUR office with the intent to take the LEGOs was not happy. So what? He stole the \u201cgifts\u201d. It seems as if you treat his kids nice. He has no respect for that.", "NTA. Legos are a freaking amazing gift. If the kids are happy that's what matters. Your brother just wanted that PS5 for himself. \n\nThe next time your brother comes for a visit, you might want to tell him to get a hotel. There's no excuse for stealing your things.", "Love it! Good for you.  My boss has me using a word.  I was saying entitled and she said no\u2026it\u2019s audacity.  Your brother has the audacity to complain about lack of gifts?!? Maybe he should speak to your parent who also have the audacity to allow this to happen and also spill surprises.  The audacity.  Tell your brother that maybe the parent can go live with him and then he won\u2019t have to come to your house at all if all he comes for is free expensive gifts", "NTA. It sounds like your brother wants the ps5 lol he sounds immature. You are not even obligated to give any gifts. I think your brother is rude and ungrateful, he doesn\u2019t seem to have manners too.

Your brother is wrong, and he is teaching his children that respecting boundaries is not important!  He's also teaching that that bad behavior gets rewarded....HIS bad behavior!  There are lots of adult who enjoy building Lego sets!  Why not?!  They are challenging and fun and really awesome!  I am way beyond adulthood and I have a bunch of dolls and paper dolls and art supplies, because they bring me joy in a chaotic world!  You owe no explanations to your parents or siblings, whatsoever!\n\nI wouldn't feel pressured to give the kids anything beyond what you feel you can afford and what is appropriate.  It's not HIS choice to go begging for gifts, especially after he helped himself to steal items out of your office!  \n\nI suggest you tell him that until the items are returned to you, with 100% of the pieces present, he shouldn't expect any more gifts coming his way.  I don't blame the kids....I blame bad parenting guidelines.", "Your brother crossed boundaries you put in place and when he did you reacted better than I would have. Gifts are privileges not rights.

Yet, in the end, the kids loved their gifts (legos).", "The kids were happy and that's all that matters. Your brother should never have gone into your office and taken the lego. Some nerve!  What he did shows tremendous disrespect for you. He needed a wake-up call about his behaviour. I think it was fine for you to hold onto the PS5. I can't believe he would call you names. That's crazy. He needs to learn to control himself.", "Wow, entitled much? Your brother is a big time asshole. You don't take and you don't demand. Gifts are gifts, not obligations. Feel free to put a lock on your office door if you decide to let them visit again.", "He stole from you, and yet, he still wants you to give his children gifts. \n\nNTA", "Your house, your things, your choices, your rules. Kids got gifts. NTA.", "NTA. The kids were happy that\u2019s all that matters. If your brother wants a ps5 so bad he can buy it. It\u2019s not like you let them see it then told them they couldn\u2019t keep it.", "That's awesome. This is awesome. Bro effed around and found out quick. NTA", "NTA.  To OP\u2019s brother, \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole and thief.\u201d", "So he stole from you and gets mad that he isn't getting a PS5?

Bad Cop and Han Solo are currently protecting my purse in my hidden pocket. Being family doesn't give them free reign in your home and just because your parents live with you in your home means that they can stomp your boundaries and invade your personal spaces. Enjoy your PS5, I hope you can get some great Lego games for it, they were super fun on the Wii.", "NTA. And I'd say he wanted the ps5 for himself.  That's why he was pissef.

I have zero tolerance for thieves.", "NTA, your brother is. They have their gift, they are happy with them that's all that matters. Put a lock on that door and it should stay locked next visit. Also, remind your brother the next visit the kids should bring something to do.", "NTA. I'm so mad on your behalf; your brother abused your hospitality and had the audacity to insult you when you didn't give his children another expensive gift on top of the expensive items he already stole from you. You were more than gracious; you would have been within your rights to insist upon the return of your stolen property. \n\nAnd your parents' role in this doesn't look good either. Telling you that the Lego sets were \"just toys\" as if that makes it ok for your brother to steal them? Not cool. That is your hobby and it's not ok for your parents to belittle your hobby.

Also If you see this, check out the Lepin and off brand Legos from Aliexpress. A fraction on the price and the quality is exactly the same.

They are expensive and whenever my kids are invited to a birthday party, which is about 15 in a school year,many of the parents say oh they just like Legos and I can never find a set within my budget that seems like it's very substantial from my point of view and chances are they will get more than one set of the same when the entire class has a similar budget and are told Legos are the most desired gift.", "They should be getting HER a gift for hosting them!!!", "I suspect he has at least some idea, which is why he was so eager to get his hands on them.", "Teaching kids to respect personal boundaries and other people's belongings ia a damn useful lesson.\n\nThe parents fucked up, not the OP.", "I understand your point.
