You have been very generous with your time and space - letting your parents live in the basement suite, putting up your brother and his wife in your part of the house, and giving the kids gifts every time they visit.\n\nAnd I want to follow up on that last part in detail because it illustrates how much your brother has been taking you for granted. \n\nFirstly, as someone else mentioned, it's his and his wife's job to provide entertainment for their kids, not yours to have toys just lying around in case a kid comes by your house. If the kids were bored, then they should have taken them out for an adventure or suggested something that they and the grandparents could do together, or got out toys/books from their own stash.\n\nSecondly, while a lot of people are nosy enough to stick their heads round the door of an unlocked room they haven't been in, that still doesn't make it right. Especially given that some people's jobs require confidentiality. And that's made worse by his taking something that a) you had actively denied permission for him to use, and b) was brand-new and in a sealed unit. He had no right to do that. It was a betrayal of your trust. It was your office and your belongings, and it does not matter that it happened to be toys he wanted rather than jewellery or electronics - they were still yours to make decisions about and that is the part that matters.\n\nThirdly, your brother has become far too used to your generosity, and it seems to have affected the way he perceives your role in the family. You are not an automated gift dispenser. It is not usual for people to give gifts to visiting children every single time they visit. Children aren't royalty and they don't need gifts for existing. It is not something his children are owed, and neither is it owed to him as their parent. As host, you are already giving them the gift of a place to stay, food to eat, and your time and company (when possible). Gifts aren't usually involved in family visits at all, but when there are gifts involved in the guest-host relationship, it is far more customary for the guests to give their host a gift as thanks and recognition of the life disruption (however welcome) that their extra presence has caused. \n\nHis demanding presents for his children is immensely rude and entitled, and all the more so given that you were generous enough to gift them the Lego sets he took from you *and his kids were happy with that*.", "Yay I found it hehe..

My niece was excited, happy, and amazed that she got to *keep* the minifig she 'stole' even after I found out.\n\nThe difference is my sister doesn't expect me to buy expensive gifts for her family every visit - Even though I've bought them all sorts of consoles, games and Lego etc.\n\nSo it was definitely that the husband was wanting the PS5 for himself, her niblings were happy that their Aunty let them keep the cool stuff from her house.", ">NTA op.
