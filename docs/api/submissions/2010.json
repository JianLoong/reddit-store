You have been very generous with your time and space - letting your parents live in the basement suite, putting up your brother and his wife in your part of the house, and giving the kids gifts every time they visit.\n\nAnd I want to follow up on that last part in detail because it illustrates how much your brother has been taking you for granted. \n\nFirstly, as someone else mentioned, it's his and his wife's job to provide entertainment for their kids, not yours to have toys just lying around in case a kid comes by your house. If the kids were bored, then they should have taken them out for an adventure or suggested something that they and the grandparents could do together, or got out toys/books from their own stash.\n\nSecondly, while a lot of people are nosy enough to stick their heads round the door of an unlocked room they haven't been in, that still doesn't make it right. Especially given that some people's jobs require confidentiality. And that's made worse by his taking something that a) you had actively denied permission for him to use, and b) was brand-new and in a sealed unit. He had no right to do that. It was a betrayal of your trust. It was your office and your belongings, and it does not matter that it happened to be toys he wanted rather than jewellery or electronics - they were still yours to make decisions about and that is the part that matters.\n\nThirdly, your brother has become far too used to your generosity, and it seems to have affected the way he perceives your role in the family. You are not an automated gift dispenser. It is not usual for people to give gifts to visiting children every single time they visit. Children aren't royalty and they don't need gifts for existing. It is not something his children are owed, and neither is it owed to him as their parent. As host, you are already giving them the gift of a place to stay, food to eat, and your time and company (when possible). Gifts aren't usually involved in family visits at all, but when there are gifts involved in the guest-host relationship, it is far more customary for the guests to give their host a gift as thanks and recognition of the life disruption (however welcome) that their extra presence has caused. \n\nHis demanding presents for his children is immensely rude and entitled, and all the more so given that you were generous enough to gift them the Lego sets he took from you *and his kids were happy with that*.", "Yay I found it hehe..

Please don't feel guilty about this!\n\nAlso, NTA. Your brother though? He sounds awful! He's a disrespectful, rude, ungracious and ungrateful THIEF.\n\nHe would NOT be coming over to my house anymore. Since your parents seem to live in your downstairs rent free, tell them that the next time they want your brother and his family to visit, that they can pitch in for a hotel, since they've demonstrated that they're not to be trusted.", "/u/CharmingPie9315 - don't feel guilty for buying/collecting the things that make you happy and bring you joy. \nI turned 42 in September and when I was a little girl at 2 years old, my Mother got me a stuffed Papa Smurf for Christmas. I held onto that Papa Smurf and even passed it down to my now 25 and 21 year old adult kids. I had it until 2005, which is when my Mother passed away at 43. I was 24 years old and really sad. Last year, I happened to find a brand new Papa Smurf on Etsy for only 12$. I was so happy to have my Papa Smurf back. He sleeps in my bed with me every day. I also got me some Funko Pop GiJoes, Transformers, Dragonball Z and Lil Wayne and OutKast. I freaking love them. \nYou're never too old for toys - we are all still kids at heart. \n\nYou are NTA and you played the game very well, young sir. \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6", "Please, do not feel guilty. In this world, especially in these times, it's important to treat our inner child with love and kindness. Let yourself play guilt free!! You deserve it.", "Honestly, I would've been dramatic and called the cops. Why? Because people like that need a strong reaction and consequence so they know not to fuck with you later on. Otherwise they step all over you forever", "Especially if they were happy about the Legos.\n\nNot that the Legos weren't a good gift but I think with older kids there'd be a higher likelihood of them putting 2 and 2 together.", "Yes that was my thoughts? How d are these kids- now im not here to judge OP or how she soends her money, but chances are its the dad that would play with a ps5, kids already have a switch im sure thats plenty for them\n\nNta op", "In the future i'd make sure not to gift the kids stuff that brother might enjoy or sell", "She should give the PS5 or monetary equivalent to the shelter, and for the next holiday give the brother's family a  thank you note from the shelter for their gift.", "Problem is, because the parents live there too, *they* could just have the brother over. And they're likely to, because he's their other child.  \nWhich is why OP really needs a lock for their office door.", "I usually keep the door between us locked. It was a planned rental suite.", "Nothing but a bunch of leeches. What I would give for a family member as kind and generous as OP \ud83d\ude2d", "Just because I wonder sometimes about the kids staying in those places and if they would enjoy playing with them too.", "I have never heard that expression. When was this a thing?", "I don't know what it means but it sounds complimentary.  Thanks.", "I use my doubles to do silly things like recreate the pointing Spiderman meme.", "Hey now. There's no reason to be calling the kids brats. They very much may be unaware and we're grateful for the sets when they were gifted them. The thieving parents are the problem here, not the kids.", "Hey now, the *kids* might be completely innocent. They're children; there's a reason children can't be tried as adults, and it's because they *don't* understand the consequences of crimes the same way adults do. Especially with the example their dad's setting for them, in this case. He's not exactly teaching them *not* to steal, is he?\n\nThe brother is the one who screwed up here, because he's a grown man who can legally be held accountable for his actions, and he knows theft is wrong.", "I was thinking the same thing!  A \"few boxes of legos\" could easily cost more than a PS5!", "I don't actually feel angry towards the kids. They didn't go into my office and take my stuff.", "odds are the LEGOs are worth more than the PS5\n\nespecially if it was an older sealed set, they go up in price between 10-20% per year", "It's still a thing", "I read a book that talked about something called a four part apology. It is the only kind that seems sincere to me.", "Fair point.\n\nSo the thieving brat and his kids who are getting a bad example .. :)", "Exactly. We don't know what the brother even *told* them - they might have no idea. And even if they do... Well, look at the example that's being set for them. Pretty sure their father's *not* teaching them that theft is wrong, so how are they supposed to know that?", "The kids might not even know they had been stolen.", "Right!? Someone who buys ny kid's grand and expensive gifts, at that!", "They aren\u2019t sealed anymore - the kids were playing with them .", "Of our ever stops being a thing I don't want to hear it. It's so perfectly descriptive for the type of person it's applied to."]}
