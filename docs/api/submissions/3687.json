One of those reasons is that he is a parasite, in the past he stayed several times in our house and i hated it. He spends all his time playing online games, drinking or partying and I don't want to live with someone like that. Also we just had a baby three months ago and we are still getting used to this new life as we are both first time parents, and we just want peace and privacy, so I told my husband that he can't stay here with us and he spoke to his nephew and told him what our decision was.\n\nLong story short his nephew got mad and now the whole family thinks I brainwashed my husband into hating them but that's not true. The truth is that they are used to living off my husband's money and for the first time he said no to something they asked for so of course they are angry now. But I'm not going to change my mind, I don't want him in my house even if my decision makes him lose that job, I don't care, am I the asshole for that?", "created_utc": 1669914498, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9t7ht/aita_for_not_letting_my_husbands_nephew_stay_with/", "score": 300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've got a new baby! That is NOT the time to have anyone in your house, let alone someone who's going to stress you out.\n\nAnd your reply to any of his family members having a go at you is: well why don't you take him in? They won't. \n\nGonna bring it up, cause I know it'll be a thing eventually, but you are way younger than your husband. Do his family see you as a gold digger?", "NTA. It's your home and I totally get that you don't want to share with someone you have bad experiences with.", "NTA, most people with a new baby are given a pass on stuff like this.", "NTA \n\nThe nephew sounds like a leech just like the rest of the in laws , and the fact they are angry shows that. I would just make sure to articulate all the reasons when it comes to denying his family, that way claims about being controlling won\u2019t go far.", "NTA- the only advice her is the standard line that husband should be the one to address his family. Sounds like he's supporting you, but he needs to be the one to respond or address anything that needs addressing.  Personally, if I were him, I would take umbrage at anyone calling me brainwashed.\n\nAlso, finding an apartment can be done fairly quickly- if your husband is so inclined he could offer a few days in a local hotel- but I'd be disinclined to reward bullying type behavior and I'd probably say that... \n\nYou know, I was thinking I could put nephew up in a hotel for a few days to help give him a chance to find an apartment but given the way you folks have addressed me and my family I can't help but feel as though you view our relationship as transactional.  As long as I'm willing to do whatever you want, we're family, and as soon as I have my own needs or agenda- I'm some sort of pariah and brainwashed idiot subject to the whims of my evil bride. I don't much cotton to any of that, so lose my contact info until such time as you are willing to lead with an apology and eat some humble pie.", "NTA - You have a new baby, who'd blame you for not having someone in the house you didn't want there? Oh that's right unreasonable family members.", "NTA I do understand the family's thinking of you brainwashing him. almost all couples with the age gap you guys have, have similar issues with manipulation gold digging etc. but that is not what we are here to judge atm. But if the nephew does so all that I wouldn't want him in my house either especially with a newborn. It would cause so many problems and he would likely be waking the baby up all the time with playing games (I say this as a gamer myself and my partner is a gamer). Things can get loud and heated during games which isn't the environment you need for a new baby.", "NTA  Even if there was no baby, you still would NTA. People don\u2019t get to decide how you use your home, time and money.\n He is an adult and took a job and just assumed he\u2019d be staying with you guys. Nephew needs to look for a room to rent.", "NTA- being honest, adapting to life with a child is hard. Whether or not anything about the nephew is true. (Parasite, etc.) as new parents you have EVERY right to be \u201cselfish\u201dand say no. Life, routines, and safety for your child comes first", "NTA - even if you did not have a new baby, is not entitled to your space, especially if he has proven himself to be a bad houseguest in the past", "NTA for not wanting the nephew in the home when you've got such a young baby.\n\n\nHowever, a couple of things jumped out at me, the massive age difference between you and your husband, and then the sentence about then being g used to living off your husband's money, both make me wonder if you are doing the very thing you resent others for doing, do you have a job you're taking maternity leave from, or are you planning on being a SAHM", "INFO. Is he really that bad or do you just have a grudge against him? There\u2019s nothing wrong with playing games and going out partying so long as they don\u2019t effect you - and those things definitely **can** be done without impacting you at all. If however he\u2019s stumbling home drunk, disrupting the household, and acting cantankerously, that\u2019s important to distinguish.", "NTA and good for you,  hopefully, husband will see the truth about his family.", ">Also we just had a baby three months ago and we are still getting used to this new life as we are both first time parents\n\nThat's all I needed to hear. We didn't even like brief guests when we had a newborn. NTA.", "NTA.  T", "NTA. You just had a baby, you can\u2019t handle another one on top of that.", "[deleted]", "Tell him he's welcome to stay at your place provided he helps with child care, then watch how quickly he changes his mind!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your home, your choice. Your nephew (you are married to your husband so yes, YOUR nephew) has burned his bridge with you. You have an infant to care for and don't need that kind of chaos added to your life and your home.", "NTA - sounds like you made a sound decision based on past experience.  \n\nNephew, of course is mad, he doesn't get a free place to live - too bad for him.  \n\nAnyone complaining about your decision can put him up at their house or get him a nice suite at the local hotel!", "NTA only since you have a new baby, that's no time for long-term houseguests. Other than that you sound unreasonable, IMO. Like wtf is it to you if he plays online games? That has no impact on your life. He's wanting to move for a job so he's clearly ready to at least attempt not to be a parasite. \n\nI think this is all about your resentment at your husband for helping his family or spending money on anyone other than you. I suspect this is the first of many such problems that you will have with a husband twice your age. \n\nYou get a lot of leeway as a new parent, if it weren't for that I'd say you were TA.", "YTA. how do you know he just sat around all day playing video games and partying the few times he stayed with you? Weren\u2019t you at work??\n\nYou also called it your husband\u2019s money, making me think you know you didn\u2019t earn it and it\u2019s not really yours. Sounds like you want to be the only one who wants to be able to use your husband\u2019s money. \n\nThat\u2019s your nephew too, you joined a family not just gained access to a bank account.\n\nI call gold digger!", "NTA - None of your other reasons matter--you have a new baby in the house and you don't need anything or anyone putting a single shred more of stress in your life, let alone a parasite frat boy.  He's got a job, he can go live in a residential hotel or a hostel or some such until he finds permanent housing.  This is a hill to die on.  Good luck!", "NTA -", "Definitely NTA. The baby reason alone is a perfect, valid reason. I didn't want someone to stay with me even for a night. \n\nAlso, he shouldn't have taken the job without lining up a place to live first. Sounds like he took it assuming he could stay with you and your husband, without asking. I get it he's stayed before but just because someone has offered help before, doesn't mean you should feel entitled to it or take advantage of people's kidness by relying on them", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sorry, but unless that someone moving in is gonna help with the baby, I wouldn't accept it either.

Good point. I just think OP shouldn't feel like ultimately her/their decision is what would cause him to lose his job.

Keep letting hubby run interference with his family and focus on the baby.

Of course, we\u2019ve just had a baby, so there can\u2019t be any drugs, alcohol, or guests in the house.

We were married for 27 years.", "\ud83e\udd28", "Ooo can\u2019t even lie, that was a good one.", "Well that does not change statistics, statistics say that 20years or more of age gap ends in 95% in divorce, and of course the other 5% I'm sure ends in the death of the older partner when the other partner has so much to live."]}
