Your home, your boundaries!", "ran to the comments as soon as i saw the age \ud83d\ude2d", "Sounds like he became husband because you wanted to live off of his money", "She doesn't want to share her gravy with nephew she had a baby for that gravy", "The thing I noticed was your unilateral decisive \"No\" and then your husband went to speak to his nephew.  Ok yes, the nephew may be a lazy mooching partying gamer and you have a baby, but did your husband at least get a chance to think about it himself?", "But seriously aside from you probably also only getting with the old dude for money and having a problem when anyone else might get a slurp of the gravy his partying is inappropriate to have around a baby your not wrong there what so ever\n Maybe hubby can help him get into a place of his own that he can take over paying for since he is starting a job and should be able to provide for himself or is that that taking away from your inheritance pot", "YTA your husband pays for everything, which is a reason you went after someone so old. He can let HIS family stay in HIS home. Don\u2019t want anyone else mooching off him? \n\nI swear no one cares about family these days. You\u2019ll hear what you want on here because that\u2019s Reddit but your an AH. I hope he had you sign a prenup.\n\nWhat makes you special? Why is it OK for you to live off your husbands money but his actual family can\u2019t? You\u2019re just married. That\u2019s it. Divorces happen all the time.", "Now I ain\u2019t saying she\u2019a gold digger\u2026", "NTA, God, no, it makes perfect sense. And maybe because this is Reddit, given that nephew is already a layabout and the rest of the family is mean-spirited, I can imagine your DH being away for one night and nephew claiming you came on to him. I wouldn't want to be alone in the place with him. Looking for Trouble 101, y'know?", "NTA That\u2019s not the kind of environment you want an infant to be in. Good for you for speaking up.", "when you weren't even born your husband was 28 years old.", "I think she\u2019s not obligated for houseguest\u2026 but to say you don\u2019t care if he loses his job is cold blooded. Yikes", "Oooh  well done! I snort laughed!", "She is a stay at home mom\u2026 not a sugar baby. \ud83e\udd72Last time I checked, sugar babies don\u2019t marry their sugar daddy and have kids with them? That\u2019s just her husband dude", "Even if she doesn\u2019t have a job chances are being the sugar baby in that relationship, she\u2019s taking care of the chores around the house, cooking him dinner, taking care of the baby, and most of the other household things. The nephew would do nothing but sit there and play video games and drink so no, she\u2019s not more of a parasite than him. Fuck off with your judgemental *assumed* shit", "Wait, so because a younger woman is with an older man she must be a sugar baby? If the genders were reversed would you even be asking this question?", "I said \"housing lined up first\", but moreso what I meant was put thought into your living situation and  have realistic options that you can swing first. \nIf there was an amazing job and the ONLY possible way I could swing working there was staying with a friend/family for awhile - I would have asked when I applied. Definitely before I accepted. It's unlikely and BS if the nephew couldn't find another way to make it work, especially if it's an amazing job. \n\nBut in general yes, I'd say it's unprofessional and unwise to accept a position without having some sort of plan  that will allow you to actually work there. Probably burn a bridge with that company (and maybe your current company) to accept a job, only to later rescind your acceptance or quit because you did not confirm that the only realistic way you'd be able to work there was actually an option first. Would likely look better and potentially keep the opportunity open in the future, to decline initially rather than accept and later change your mind for something like that. \n\nIt is just a huge AH move on his part if that was the legit only option for him to accept without confirming that he could stay there first. It puts his fate in this job in their hands, which could guilt them into saying yes or feel worse about saying no, gets other family upset because \"nephew already accepted, maybe put in his 2 week notice  and you're the only thing standing in the way\" type thing. There is no way he couldn't commute, rent a room in an apartment, or find any other solution to keep this job. Either way, if those aren't possible or he only accepted it thinking he would live tbere- he should have lined it up before officially accepting.", "Nope.  There's not always a huge power differential.  You might want to stop talking in absolutes.  There is often? a power differential.  That is all you can safely say about a huge age gap.", "NTA but your husband being a father for the first time at 55 is odd...I mean, he's going to be 73 when your baby graduates HS! Good grief.", "NTA", "NTA. \nSo they think there is only your house left to live in this entire area and all others are damaged, no place on earth is livable anymore. If he cannot live in your house, he will loose the job. *this is only a guilty feeling, trying to install in you* please reject every single time.", "YTA. You live off your husband money too?", "Dad's best friend dating his daughter?! You do realize that is grooming material right there right? Disgusting you are condoning this.", "where did it say that in her post?", "Yeah that \u201cwe\u2019re both new parents\u201d thing threw me. Babe maybe you might constitute as new, your husband, however\u2026? Kind of gave me a little chuckle.\n\nWonder if nephew calls her \u201cauntie\u201d.", "how is their relationship your business though? she didn\u2019t ask for advice on her age gap relationship.", "NTA\n\nSorry it seems the worst trash of reddit found their way to your post. Regardless of your age you have just as much of a right to be a SAHM and have just as much of a say in the household as someone married to a man the same age. \n\n\nIf you're uncomfortable with him in the home then he shouldn't be there and you're husband agrees so I don't see the issue.", "NTA", "NTA", "You are spot on but the jab on age difference?? I am sure no one would have dared mock Gloria for marrying Jay \ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\udd14", "If the power differential\u2019s in her husband\u2019s favour why is she the asshole? Wouldn\u2019t it make him the asshole for marrying her?", "OH NO! My god you\u2019re right, that\u2019s sick. \n\nThere\u2019s literally a bigger age gap between her and her husband than her and her infant\ud83e\udd2e", "She has less of an age difference between her and her baby.", "Even if she's a sugar baby she wouldn't be a parasite.

When your child is your age your husband will be 80. All of my grandparents died before they reached the age of 80. Is that what you want for your child? To be unable to be walked down the aisle or have their parent at their graduations?  I mean this isn't really for the person who wrote the post this is a warning to people thinking they should fall down her tracks. Do you want your child to lose one of their parents when they're in their mid twenties and you really lose your partner when you're in your 50s? Are you then going to find a partner who's 25 and then have another child and continue the cycle", "Also for the baby  s sake (covid danger, late nights etc ) your answer  is the best.

I don't understand what's the effing problem for some people with age gaps.\n\nSomeone already accused OP for being a sugar baby lol", "It's their relationship.
