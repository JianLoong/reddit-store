People have security cameras and systems in their houses for multiple reasons.~~\n\nI do think the bathroom camera in your own bathroom is probably too invasive as far as recording stuff is concerned, regardless if it's your own bathroom or not. Their snooping was definitely unwarranted. I guess I also made an assumption...is your bathroom connected to your room (Like an on suite) or is it separate? If it's connected I would think the camera to the bedroom would be sufficient.\n\nEDIT: Almost forgot; the guests also suck because of a security measure and didn't have to take the whole thing public; heck in doing that they probably drew more attention to themselves compared to what they wanted.\n\nEDIT2: As per my reply, I read the whole post wrong as far as where the bathroom cameras were.
