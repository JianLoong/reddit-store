This is can happen when there is a lack of home training in those formative years. The side effects may vary but often include lack of common sense, respect, and self preservation who turn into entitled self serving adults.

NTA, OP", "I agree, and OP is NTA\n\nI do worry that maybe she was looking for some slightly embarrassing necessity (tampons, a stool softener etc) only to have it turn into all this. \nBut I guess we can all find ourselves in situations where we can either choose to save our face or our ass. She chose face!", "She could have been arrogant enough to think they weren't always on and that they didn't turn them on with her there. Since she knows OP's parents maybe she thought she was special.", "Beautiful isn\u2019t it?!", "I hate to break it to you but if you pay for a hotel the common areas and areas you aren\u2019t allowed into will probably also have security cameras. \nOP didn\u2019t put cameras in the guest bedrooms or bathrooms, only in their own private bedroom and bathroom. They inform their guests and the cameras are not hidden.", "I don't think you can be charged as a voyeur when the cameras are visible in your home? At any rate, I would not want to be on camera. But, I don't go snooping through people's stuff either. I would just go to a hotel if I didn't like your setup.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You absolutely have every right to have surveillance in your home. They're just upset they were caught doing something they shouldn't have and then lying about it.", "NTA, she used your private bathroom without permission.", "NTA:\n\n\"My house has cameras in it, including my personal bedroom/bathroom. Specifically, the Guest Area does not, that bedroom and bathroom have no cameras (I dare you to make me prove it). \n\nAt no point has this been a surprise. Fuck you and have a nice day.\"\n\nThis has never been a secret.", "NTA. You're in the right. Just keep telling your story. They're doing going to be embellishing theirs and showing what liars they are.", "Even if the cameras were a secret, still NTA. The AH's had personal space assigned with no cameras, no violation of privacy, and then they got *caught* violating OP's personal space. The fact that cameras didn't prevent this was the lesser issue. It's just proof...\n\nWhy the fuck are you roaming around the house like you own it? Get out of my room!", "Even if they didn\u2019t know\u2026what reason would they have to be in their bedroom?", "Well, considering it sounds like an older woman since she called his parents (they're retired and moved there years ago so that seems a bit sus tbh but it's what's there) so I could easily imagine her legitimately forgetting he mentioned it", "Medication. I am prescribed three drugs people take recreationally. Caught an ex friend poking around looking for said meds. I don't keep them in my bathroom for this reason", "Humans are curious by nature. She very well could have just been interested to see the bedroom and bathroom. Not great behavior but also not horrible. I feel like this whole thing snowballed. Did the guest actually know about the cameras or did OP tell the guest those rooms were off limits?", "Did you make it? Was it good?", "NTA, but your house guest certainly was.", "NTA . You can put whatever you want in your own home. As long as you\u2019re disclosing that cameras exist, you aren\u2019t responsible for the actions of people who don\u2019t understand how cameras work.", "Hell NTA!!  I totally get it. We have 9 cameras outside.I know several people that have cameras inside. I live in Pasco county and totally understand having people stay with you.", "NTA. She lied and got caught out. You have every right to have cameras in your house", "Wait? But didn\u2019t you say you tell people about the cameras?\n\nShe got her own bathroom. No need to poop and snoop in yours. \n\nLike it\u2019s your bathroom. If you want film yourself showering cool guess that\u2019s a you thing like people  videoing themselves having sex. Point being you don\u2019t expect people to shower and poop in your bathroom. They get their own within a camera in there. She doesn\u2019t want to be filmed doing that, we\u2019ll use the one she got \n\nNTA", "Your guest was 100% in the wrong, NTA.\n\nBut does the law that says you can't record people in a private bathroom (as a place to reasonably expect privacy) open you up to legal action? Might want to do some CYA on this if this guest gets upset enough to pursue it. The fact that they were told not to go in there might not matter as far as violating their privacy with the bathroom cam.", "If all the other bathrooms are full they wait. They don't get to go into someone else's personal space. Even kids know how to wait for an empty bathroom.", "Not everyone listens when people are explaining important information and rules.", "They put them in **every room** except the guest bedroom and bath. That's bizarre.", "So do hotels. \n\nSecurity cameras are incredibly popular with most homeowners", "NTA. She invaded your privacy.", "NTA...and what the hell? High class security systems monitor inside as well as outside. I wish I had a few cameras", "NTA. What a nightmare", ">We made them obvious and we tell all our guests about them.\n\nHow didn't they know they were being recorded then?", "How do they not realise that if they back talk in this situation, it will back fire with evidence?", "NTA, you told your guests about them, that's all you need to do to not be an asshole.\n\nIf you didn't tell them, you'd be an asshole. Even if people are just minding their own business watching TV, they have the right to know if they're being recorded on video.", "YTA\n\nYou're probably a pervert too.\n\nThis may actually be illegal regardless of it being your property. Beats me though.\n\nRecording people on audio without consent is illegal in a lot of states.", "NTA you have security cameras in your bedroom and bathroom that only you are supposed to be using. The guests have privacy in their own rooms and bathrooms. They went snooping and then lied about it. I would have told them to GTFO too! And to tattle to your parents, what are they 7?", "NTA. Your house, your rules. You were honest about the cameras and you kept the guest rooms totally private. That's more than above board. \n\nThe fact that you needed cameras because your friends have disrespected your property is the real issue here. It sounds like you need to renovate your friend list. Those people - NOT your friends. You real friends will know this is a bunch of BS, and everyone else is dead weight you don't need in your life. \n\nIf I was caught in that lie, I would be MORTIFIED. I'd be embarrassed for snooping and even more so for lying about it. I would probably be packing my own bags and apologizing for weeks.", "NTA. They violated your privacy by entering your bedroom and bathroom when you had been gracious and let them stay with you. If they didn't want to be filmed, stay in the guest WC.\n\nAlso, you are retired and they call your parents? What are they supposed to do? Send you to your room and ground you?", "NTA: It was your bathroom and bedroom. That you said were off limits. Snoops deserve to get caught. She\u2019s not crying because she feels like she did something wrong, she\u2019s crying because she got caught.", ">She has a camera in her bathroom to catch lying, potentially thieving, ~~snoopers~~ poopers*\n\nFTFY"]}
