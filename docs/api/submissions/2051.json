I am very clear about which rooms have no cameras. My bedroom and my en suite bathroom.  I might be the asshole here because I had an older lady as a houseguest and when she went snooping in my room and bathroom she was recorded using my bathroom.

Your house, your rules. She lied to you.", "NTA. If she didn't want to be filmed, she was welcome to use, you know, the guest bathroom, not your personal one that was off-limits.

There's no winning this one.", "NTA. What's she mad at? You monitoring your property like any reasonable home owner who has assets he'd like to protect?

Ummmm, yuck, why????", "NTA, predicated entirely on them knowing you had those cameras in there.", "~~ESH~~  NTA\n\n~~Only reason I am giving this rating is because yes, it's not a good idea to be putting cameras in the bathroom (especially a guest bathroom?!) as that can be construed as being a voyeur or peeping tom. However as far as other areas of the house...welcome to the modern era people. People have security cameras and systems in their houses for multiple reasons.~~\n\nI do think the bathroom camera in your own bathroom is probably too invasive as far as recording stuff is concerned, regardless if it's your own bathroom or not. Their snooping was definitely unwarranted. I guess I also made an assumption...is your bathroom connected to your room (Like an on suite) or is it separate? If it's connected I would think the camera to the bedroom would be sufficient.\n\nEDIT: Almost forgot; the guests also suck because of a security measure and didn't have to take the whole thing public; heck in doing that they probably drew more attention to themselves compared to what they wanted.\n\nEDIT2: As per my reply, I read the whole post wrong as far as where the bathroom cameras were.
