Sue likes Jane well enough, but finds her pushy and overbearing.

Sue said it was okay if Jane waits outside and talks to her through the door (which I already think is too accommodating) but Jane ignores her and laughs it off, saying that they \"have the same parts\" and that since they're close, Sue shouldn't be worried about using the bathroom in front of her. Sue said that she didn't care who had what parts- bathroom time is private and that's that. I agreed and told my sister to knock it off. \n\nMy sister started complaining about this, so I asked her, \"Jane, do you follow your co workers at your internship into the bathroom?\" She laughed and said \"No, that would be sexual harassment!\" I said, \"The same rule applies in our home.

That\u2019s one thing they really struggle with. My stepson is autistic. He was constantly following me into the bathroom or walking in our bedroom to me changing. He even crawled into bed with me when I was naked once. \n\nI could not fathom that a 12 year old boy thought this behavior was okay, no matter how many times my husband (his dad) tried to correct it, he didn\u2019t get it. Locks are amazing, and he eventually got it I think. It just took a lot of explaining it was inappropriate behavior. \n\nI\u2019m going with NAH as I don\u2019t think your sister is consciously trying to be inappropriate. Please consider sitting her down and telling her you and your wife aren\u2019t mad at her, you\u2019re upset with the behavior which she can fix. It isn\u2019t a matter of \u201cwhat parts\u201d people have. It\u2019s about bodily autonomy. \n\nShe\u2019s right that there are situations where people with the same parts are okay with people who have the same parts seeing them undressed. Like locker rooms for example. But the person going into the locker room knows that people will be seeing them undressed and has the choice to enter and change or not to enter. It\u2019s their choice.\n\nIn the case with your wife, she has decided no, she\u2019s not okay with it. That\u2019s the problem. \n\nIf a coworker asked your sister on a date, and she said no. That\u2019s not harassment. If the coworker starts asking her every day for a date. That\u2019s harassment. \n\nThe same thing here. She tried to follow your wife into the bathroom, your wife said no. Instead of accepting the no she is now harassing your wife. Tell her you\u2019re not trying to upset her, your wife wants a good relationship and so is trying to end the behavior (aka the harassment) that is making her uncomfortable and preventing a good relationship from forming. \n\nKeep telling her the same thing, as gently as you can, emphasize that you aren\u2019t mad at her, and hopefully she will get it.

Sometimes autistic people don\u2019t understand conceptual things , and by saying it like that you put a precise picture on the situation. You made her understand.  You set boundaries, even if she\u2019s mad about it, it\u2019s for the well being of the entire house.", "NTA. You had to say itin a way that your sister could understand.  Although, I'm not sure if she really understood because she only became upset when you said you would kick her out.  Your parents should take care of her housing needs if they are so apalled by the situation.", "NTA. You put it in terms she understood. When the reality hit her she was upset.", "As a fellow autistic person, NTA.", "NTA \n\nI wonder what the parents said when you asked them to take responsibility ?", "NTA and it sounds like you would be doing your sister a huge favor by showing her this post.  Let her know that you love her but that she's pushy and overbearing and if she can't respect other people's boundaries, she will live a much more lonely and unhappy life.  \n\nIt doesn't mean she isn't a good person, but she does seem to lack some basic social skills.  If she ever hears someone's boundaries or their NO and disregards them.  She needs to understand that what she is actually doing is showing disrespect towards them.", "NTA, as someone who is autistic sometimes people need to give us very strict boundaries of why what we\u2019re doing is uncomfortable for them.\n\nI think it\u2019s unfortunate that you had to tell her she was sexually harassing Sue, because obviously that is a sucky thing to hear, especially because I highly doubt that was her intention and she was just trying to spend time with someone she was bonding with. However, she was not getting it any other way and as a result this is what had to be say, which while I think was sucky for Jane to hear again had to be said and hopefully she can understand where y\u2019all are coming from and move past it. But you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. As an autistic adult it can be hard to get subtle boundary hints. This is her ignoring clearly stated boundaries. If you see this OP? Please consider sitting down with your sister and explaining the social consequences of doing this to non coworkers and that it really is sexual harassment and comes off as creepy. \n\nI would add in an explanation that people who live with you can need quiet time and space. People often forget not all autism is a guarantee of introversion. Being an extrovert doesn't mean the constant having to analyze the social situations for cues is less exhausting but it can translate into things like this. \n\nSomething I evolved into my social routines has been to tell potential new friends directly that if they do not tell me what I am doing wrong or their boundaries I cannot accommodate them because I will miss the hints. It sounds like your wife is trying to be as clear as possible but it's also a thing that takes time. I was not raised with boundaries so I understand the consequences for myself of not having them but many autistic people don't have that \"This hurt me so I should be careful with others\" association. Laying out the consequences of why it's uncomfortable helps with applying this to other situations. \n\nIt does sometimes conflict with the frustration of some people treating me like a child as soon as the word autism is said but I would rather those people outted themselves as ableist and the relationships I want to cultivate are nurtured. There is some step missing for a lot of us on applying the concept without concrete this = that. \n\nI will add that you absolutely did the right thing in defending your wife. It sounds like she's a lovely woman who also tries to avoid conflict. With autism that's being direct vs the passive side stepping that works on people who can get subtle social cues. Subtle btw means anything less than two by four blunt for me and my friends.", "NTA\n\nShe clearly understands it is an inappropriate thing to do at work/with colleagues so her refusal to \u201cunderstand\u201d Sue asking for the same treatment at home is just that - a refusal.

She wasn't grasping what you were saying it so you put it in terms she could understand.", "NTA - \u201cbonding in her own way\u201d?  Yeesh.  Do your parents defend and excuse a lot of things like this for your sister?\n\nYou did the right thing and used her words and experiences to set things in perspective after she ignored your wife.  Your sister needs to learn to respect boundaries.", "NTA I\u2019m autistic and used to do this to my mom until I was a teen and she told me to knock it off. I forgot the first few times until she blew up at me. Honestly be super blunt with your sister no sugar coating things. Autistics can\u2019t \u201cread between the lines\u201d so unles you straight up tell he \u201cdon\u2019t do this or (whatever consequences you want) will happen she won\u2019t get the message", "Solidly NTA. NTA for saying it, NTA for being mad about it.\n\nMy autism means that I do not always understand *why* people have certain boundaries. Sometimes they can be explained to me in a way that I understand, and sometimes no amount of explaining helps me understand, because they\u2019re just too alien for me to grok them. But I do not need to understand *why*. It\u2019s easier if I can, but I only need to understand that the boundaries *do* exist. I don\u2019t even need people to try to explain them if they don\u2019t want to, though it\u2019s helpful. If someone says *please don\u2019t share what I\u2019m telling you with anyone,* or *I only want to be in a relationship with you if we\u2019re exclusive,* or *don\u2019t follow me into the bathroom,* I am perfectly capable of doing what I\u2019m asked, even if I find it strange. (Or, if I find it too strange and against my own wants, removing myself from the situation, whether that means asking people not to share secrets with me, choosing to not date someone, or living alone or with people who are happy to share bathroom time.)\n\nJane is also capable of this, or she\u2019d be doing it with everyone.\n\nOne thing I think a lot of people forget, or don\u2019t understand, is that it\u2019s OK for people to feel bad sometimes. It\u2019s OK to cry because of it. It\u2019s OK to be angry when someone violates a boundary or otherwise behaves badly, and it doesn\u2019t make you an AH or a bad person. I grew up with a mother who can\u2019t abide any kind of emotional discomfort, even a bit. She reacts to guilt or shame or criticism like she\u2019s been stabbed. For a long, long time - like, thirty years - I felt like an AH every tune I upset her, because her reactions were so out of proportion that I felt like I was mortally wounding her, and as a result, I dedicated my entire life to her needs/wants, and to ensuring she was never uncomfortable, and I shoved all my own needs to the back of the line. I didn\u2019t learn to stop doing that until I was in my thirties. Then I just...I don\u2019t know, ran out of patience. I started saying no. I started not comforting her. And she sulked. She still sulks. But she lived. And she\u2019s probably better off for it, and I know I am.\n\nYou seem to have parents who coddle your sister in a similar way, and you\u2019ve done really well to grow up in a more healthy way than I did, and to not fall into the same patterns. Your boundaries are perfectly reasonable, and so is your anger at having them ignored. It\u2019s OK for Jane to feel bad - she *should* feel bad (for a while), because she did wrong, and she knows it. That\u2019s a healthy, normal way for people to feel when they do wrong. Hopefully your parents won\u2019t wreck the lesson for her.", "You didn\u2019t state your sister was sexually harassing your wife, you simply highlighted that the same behaviour in the work place would be.\n\nYou are trying to ensure your sister fully understands boundaries set by you and your wife which are completely reasonable.\n\nI know some people who are neurodivergent, can have issues with obsessive behaviour towards people or things. You could have said it different, explain that for your home, there is expectation of privacy for wife and yourself. That people need some time away from the those you live with for any reason.\n\nThere has to be some understanding of individuals who have autism, the way they think, etc. however this does not excuse them from behaviour with set expectations. It will always be about terming them in the right ways and continue to reinforce them. It\u2019s one thing to do it a family, it\u2019s not right but if they did in another setting, such as school, work or other situation and depending on how severe it is, could result in negative action or police involvement. it\u2019s important to be clear and people can learn the skills need to give the best chance in life when others may not choose or want to understand why they behaviour differently.\n\nI would say NTA as you were trying to explain and reinforce boundaries but it could have worked differently. I don\u2019t think that there is anything wrong with saying if this continues what the consequences will be which can be agreed between you and your wife.", "NTA but maybe your sister sees in shows or movies how woman goto the bathroom and gossip or whatever and just wants that type of relationship with your wife not saying it\u2019s right but trying to see where she\u2019s coming from.

She needs some serious help if she can\u2019t stop harassing your wife. Eventually your wife is going to snap.", "NTA all the way. Jane is way out of line.", "NTA - If you had intiated that she was sexually harassing your wife, I'd say you were misusing the term. But that wasn't your phrase, it came from her mouth and you bounced it right back at her in the context of \"same reason as not at work\"", "Yeah NTA as an autistic woman I\u2019m creeped out by this. I\u2019m not sure how your wife hasn\u2019t snapped", "Nta. She knows what she is doing is wrong but persists to do it", "I would approach this differently- this is a chance for your sister to learn more about how to interact with people, but she has to listen. It sounds as though your parents have been very lax because of her autism, but this won\u2019t serve your sister well going into the future. Keep in mind what your end goal is here. Reassure your sister that you love her, that she\u2019s wanted, but that it\u2019s time to do some more work on her interpersonal habits. She won\u2019t make friends if this is how she behaves. NTA, but I would lay the blame at your parents more than your sister. Sit down with your sister and agree on the rules.", "YTA. Your sister obviously has issues around personal space and clearly has an attachment disorder.  Teach her, remind her and put boundaries firmly in place.

You know she wasn't trying to sexually harass your wife and all your going to do is create problems for your sister.  Wise up.", "NTA - She proved she understands the social rule of not bothering people in the toilet. Regardless of their gender/sex. She just doesn't want to apply that rule to your wife.\n\nWhile you are not the asshole and her behaviour isn't excusable, might I suggest finding the reason for that behaviour? Obviously she doesn't see your wife sexually. Was such behaviour acceptable in your family home? Does she behave like that with her friends/roommates (with their permission ofc)? It's normal with many families, groups, cultures. She probably applies behaviour based on specific category she gave a person. \"This behaviour is inappropriate with stranger, but fine with family and friends\". And your wife belongs to \"family\" category. I know autism isn't a monolith, but it sometimes connects with such mental categorisation and not understanding/forgetting nuance when it comes to social rules. When you both calm down, have talk about personal boundaries and where they come from.\n\nIt's nothing wrong to have such relationship that you pee together, showed together etc. And while I find it weird to see a normal room as as (if not more) intimate place than bathroom, it's in the end a personal choice where do we put our boundaries.", "From listening to those who interact with those in the spectrum this may have been the clearest way to communicate.

If she tried to force her way into the bathroom at work she would be in trouble. \nParents need to realise this and not call it \"taking a chance to bond away\"", "To be fair, there have been studies of bonding in the bathroom. where strangers will talk through stalls or even hold hands during.

I'm not saying OP's sister is in the right, because it requires two people for consent, but it's a thing of cultural context. While i wouldn't go to sauna with my dad like Finns do; me, my sis and my mom don't see problem with simultaneously peeing, showering and doing makeup. Just yesterday i went for a pee, dog stopping the door with his nose and my sis going on and on about politics. I have washed my friend when she vomited all over herself.

In fact, I think they are actively making her life harder in the future. \nI\u2019m no expert on people with autism, but isn\u2019t it important for them to have clear and understandable social rules? If the parents are giving the sister bad advice about whether her behavior towards other people is acceptable, then they are actively setting her up to fail. Luckily, in this instance she understood the difference e between following her SIL into a bathroom versus doing the same with a coworker.

The reasons why won't make my wife any more comfortable with it.", "I think this is exactly right. She knows what sexual harassment is, she knows that people who sexually harass others are bad. She is now faced with the reality of \"I sexually harassed someone, so I'm bad\" and most people have trouble processing \"I'm bad\" in a healthy way.\n\nNot to mention the subtext of sexual harassment (especially in the context of workplace training) is usually \"man who wants to have sex with woman behaves inappropriately\".
