My (35m) sister, who we'll call Jane (24f) is staying with me and my wife, who we'll call Sue (32f) while completing a prestigious internship in our city. My sister is also autistic, but has lived independently, has held jobs, takes care of herself, etc. \n\nShe has totally attached herself to Sue since she doesn't have many friends. Sue likes Jane well enough, but finds her pushy and overbearing. Sue is pretty good natured and knows this is temporary, so she usually just laughs it off. \n\nThe one thing she will not laugh off is that Jane will follow Sue everywhere if she wants to talk, and even tries to follow Sue into the bathroom or our bedroom. Sue doesn't leave mid conversation unless she really needs the bathroom, but it seems like Jane magically finds something she desperately needs to talk about right when Sue is leaving the room. It's never anything important, just chit chat. We do have locks on the door, but Jane tries to follow Sue in so she can't shut the door quickly enough to keep Jane on the other side.\n\nSue has told Jane directly and clearly that our room is always off limits unless there is an emergency, and the bathroom is off limits when someone is occupying it. Sue said it was okay if Jane waits outside and talks to her through the door (which I already think is too accommodating) but Jane ignores her and laughs it off, saying that they \"have the same parts\" and that since they're close, Sue shouldn't be worried about using the bathroom in front of her. Sue said that she didn't care who had what parts- bathroom time is private and that's that. I agreed and told my sister to knock it off. \n\nMy sister started complaining about this, so I asked her, \"Jane, do you follow your co workers at your internship into the bathroom?\" She laughed and said \"No, that would be sexual harassment!\" I said, \"The same rule applies in our home. You are sexually harassing Sue and not respecting her wishes for privacy. If this ever happens again, I'm kicking you out.\" She burst into tears and ran to her room, where she called our parents who told me that I was sick and disgusting for implying that my sister was capable of sexually harassing Sue, and that I was stopping my sister from bonding with my wife in her own way. I told them that if they felt that way, they could come get her or pay for an apartment in our city, because we weren't tolerating it anymore. \n\nI know I'm not TA for standing up for my wife, but I am wondering if saying that Jane sexually harassed Sue was too far.\n\n\nEdited: Mixed the names up once- it's much harder to keep track of fake names than their real ones!", "created_utc": 1668674294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxkyck/aita_for_saying_my_sister_was_sexually_harassing/", "score": 258, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has to learn boundaries and if your wife doesn't like it then it's sexual harassment. Even if she found the word strong, then maybe she will realize how wrong it was what she was doing.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister clearly has an understanding of boundaries, but is choosing to violate your wife\u2019s. Don\u2019t put up with it.", "NTA.\n\nShe needs to respect boundaries with family as she respects with strangers.\n\nShe likes to have her own boundaries respected so she should understand. \n\nMy brother stopped trying to get into the bathroom with us when he was 3.

You did well putting clear boundaries.", "NTA. Like wtf?", "NTA.\n\nShe is aware the action itself wrong. For some reason she believes it only applies to co-workers.

Autistic or not this is highly inappropriate. Worst of all she actually realises this-she\u2019s obviously self-aware enough to know this is unacceptable behaviour in the work place. I would limit my contact by not inviting her over or seeing her somewhere else until she respects those boundaries.", "NTA. All you have done is set boundaries to allow your wife some peace in her own home. Your sister is a grownup, regardless of her designation. While she's upset now, I think the way you explained to her how the home is just like a workplace boundary wise was a great parallel to draw.", "NTA, for saying that because it\u2019s true. However, if you don\u2019t have your sister move out YWBTA. It\u2019s harsh but your wife doesn\u2019t deserve this, no matter how patient she is, this is creepy and unhealthy for everyone.", "NTA. It may have been too much if you had just come out with it but it was your sister who identified it would be sexual harassment at work. You've been nice and tried to set boundaries and be accomodating enough. Hopefully it was the wake-up call your sister needed.", "NTA. She has a crush on your wife", "Ugh, I feel for your wife. That\u2019s one thing they really struggle with. My stepson is autistic. He was constantly following me into the bathroom or walking in our bedroom to me changing. He even crawled into bed with me when I was naked once. \n\nI could not fathom that a 12 year old boy thought this behavior was okay, no matter how many times my husband (his dad) tried to correct it, he didn\u2019t get it. Locks are amazing, and he eventually got it I think. It just took a lot of explaining it was inappropriate behavior. \n\nI\u2019m going with NAH as I don\u2019t think your sister is consciously trying to be inappropriate. Please consider sitting her down and telling her you and your wife aren\u2019t mad at her, you\u2019re upset with the behavior which she can fix. It isn\u2019t a matter of \u201cwhat parts\u201d people have. It\u2019s about bodily autonomy. \n\nShe\u2019s right that there are situations where people with the same parts are okay with people who have the same parts seeing them undressed. Like locker rooms for example. But the person going into the locker room knows that people will be seeing them undressed and has the choice to enter and change or not to enter. It\u2019s their choice.\n\nIn the case with your wife, she has decided no, she\u2019s not okay with it. That\u2019s the problem. \n\nIf a coworker asked your sister on a date, and she said no. That\u2019s not harassment. If the coworker starts asking her every day for a date. That\u2019s harassment. \n\nThe same thing here. She tried to follow your wife into the bathroom, your wife said no. Instead of accepting the no she is now harassing your wife. Tell her you\u2019re not trying to upset her, your wife wants a good relationship and so is trying to end the behavior (aka the harassment) that is making her uncomfortable and preventing a good relationship from forming. \n\nKeep telling her the same thing, as gently as you can, emphasize that you aren\u2019t mad at her, and hopefully she will get it. Sometimes it takes multiple explanations for things to click.", "NTA", "NTA. \nUnderstanding boundaries is hard for people on the spectrum but you used an example that she would understand. \nIts no difference, theres bonding and then theres weirdly telling someone to pee in front on them", "Question - is your sister aware that people may make \u201caccommodations\u201d for her autism?

Do your parents know that Jane is the one who came up with the SA-term herself? That you only applied the same rules to your house?\n\nYour wife is a saint, and you are a good man, standing up for her. \n\nNTA for letting Jane call herself a sexual harasser.", "You are right, no one should be forced to have someone else in the bathroom with them it is sexual harassment and I would find her somewhere else to li e or send her to your parents, let them have her follow them into the toilet.", "NTA your sister doesn't sexually harass her co-workers because she's well able to understand the concept and why it's wrong.
