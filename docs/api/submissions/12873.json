He\u2019s a boy, it\u2019s already one thing for him to have long hair, it\u2019s another thing for him to have a ponytail like a little girl. So I put my foot down. I told my wife that if his hair is so long that it needs to be in a ponytail for him to eat, it\u2019s too long and if she didn\u2019t take him to get it cut I would simply cut it myself. She refused.\n\nShe said that she puts his hair in a ponytail all the time when she takes him out so it stays out of his eyes. This pissed me off, not only does she make our son look like a little girl, but she takes him out in public like this.

I don\u2019t want him to get a weird idea about him being a boy and my wife is making this hard and potentially confusing him.\n\nI went off on her and told her that she was not doing that to him ever again. I said that we have a boy and he needs to look like a boy. That next morning, before she woke up, I got my son and took him to a barber. We cut his hair and now he looks like a little boy as he should. My wife was furious about this, she said that doing this without telling her is a huge violation and that I completely overreacted.

They looked really cute, and they definitely were not assumed to be girls.  And yes, they even sported pony tails and man buns at times.\n\nAnd YTA, get over your outdated stereotypes.  And did it ever occur to you that she might like to be there for his first haircut? Save the hair? That is a big deal.", "If my son turns out to have curly hair, idk if I'll ever be able to bear getting his hair cut. My brother and sister both lost their beautiful ringlets after their first hair cut (my hair didn't curl until later in life). They came back eventually but my mother was devastated at the time.", "It is very common to not cut a child\u2019s curls until after 2. Boy or Girl. In my husbands family boys didn\u2019t get haircuts until they asked for it. Nothing to do with wanting girls. This Mom sounded perfectly normal. I have my boys first curls in a box. All of their first haircuts.", "My 7 yo has shoulder length hair and he has been assumed to be a girl a couple times recently. But ya know what? It doesn\u2019t matter. He corrects, or I do. He just says \u201cI\u2019m a boy with long hair\u201d. OP, YTA. Please figure your shit out before your son absorbs anymore of your toxic gender BS."]}
