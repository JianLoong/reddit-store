I can\u2019t decide if I was in the wrong here. \n\nRelevant information: my husband and I both work full time hours, we have two small children. My outdoor area is directly connected to my garage, so in essence there is no garage, just a roller door to my patio and the back of my house. \n\nMy husband and I decided to sell a large mattress and bed frame to get it out of our house. The thing is pristine; the person we bought it for never used it and it\u2019s just been sitting taking up space. So I listed it on a marketplace for a ridiculously low price to get rid of it. I had about 15 requests in the first couple of hours. So in order to be fair I went with the first person that came through, a young woman (YW). \n\nYW asked where we were located, and because it was quite a drive to us we knocked money off the asking price for \u201cgas\u201d as she said. \n\nI held the bed for over a week for her to arrange someone to get it. Finally her uncle was going to come retrieve it this evening. The agreed time was between 6PM and 7PM.  I gave her my address and my phone number, and she said her uncle would call me when they were close.\n\nAt 6PM I put my dog away into his kennel, dismantled the frame, moved the mattress and bed frame out into \u201cthe garage\u201d, covered it with drop sheets to protect it from the elements and went inside to make dinner and wait for them to arrive. \n\nAt 7PM I sent YW a message asking where they were. She said she would call them. After that, nothing. At 8PM I sent her a message saying I was sorry but they had well and truly missed their pickup window and I was going to move onto the next buyer. We moved the bed back inside so we could let the dog back out to run. \n\nAt 8:30 YW messaged me to say that they were on their way. I again told her no, they had missed their window and I would not be bringing the bed back out. At 8:45 they arrived on my driveway and started pounding on my garage door, looking for the bed. We went out and told them no and they needed to leave. \n\nAfter they left YW started ringing me repeatedly and blowing up my phone with messages about how she was sorry and they have the cash right now and they weren\u2019t able to pick up the truck until 7:30 and that\u2019s why they were late. \n\nAfter I told her no again, she reamed me out for wasting their time and their money. \n\nSo, I guess was I wrong to turn them away? It was well dark by the time they arrived. Both my kids were asleep. It would have involved trying to manoeuvre the damn thing back out in the dark and load it in the dark. \n\nIf they had let me know they were going to be late, we could have made arrangements.

Always be cautious with people coming to YOUR HOUSE from the internet, check out your multiple offers and go with who seems trustworthy and not the first person to reply, don't hold for an excessive time unless they seem worth it or you have no other offers, and don't sell low unless you immediately need the money/space because you're opening yourself up to scammers and shitheads. I can't believe the people suggesting you open your door to strangers who drove to your house after telling them not to then started pounding your door, just to 'get rid of the bed'. Even if they didn't get physically violent they definitely would have just screamed at you.

You were a bed seller, not a arbiter of promptness.", "YTA So now you still have the bed and more hassle. She was in communication with you when she found out what was going on.

You didn't waste their time, they wasted yours.", "NTA you owe them nothing, they refused to collect within a set/timely fashion.

This is no different.\nOnly thing I'd say your the AH for is agreeing to knock money off for 'gas', if they lived too far out to collect it at a reasonable expense for them that's their problem not yours. Again a retailer wouldn't knock 50 quid off because you have to drive an hour to buy the item you ordered. \nBut the. That is your own decision and you felt it was a reasonable offer/deal to your circumstances.", "Everytime I sold something on Facebook I was gave preference to the one that came to pick the object first, exactly to avoid this kind of situation.

They could send me $20 on Venmo and at the agreed time I would be standing there with $20 in my pocket. If they saw it and didn\u2019t want to continue with the property I agreed to simply refund the money. My no-show rates were approximately 40% before and they went to virtually zero. Of course, this made some people mad but I figure it was the people who were likely to stand me up anyway, and I didn\u2019t want to rent them in the first place.", "NTA.
