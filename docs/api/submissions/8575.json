{"id": 8575, "submission_id": "10o113o", "title": "AITA for refusing to attend my best friend's grad dinner?", "selftext": "My best friend \"Jordan\" (18F) and I (17F) have been close for coming up on 3 years now. Shortly after we became friends, she also became friends with a guy named \"Aiden\" (20).\n\nTheir friendship has never been quite consistent. I've always thought Aiden was mean-spirited; name-calling, incessant criticism and everything-shaming seem to just be part of how he naturally interacts with others. He has bragged about getting people addicted to drugs, and about the bad things he has done to manipulate people that loved him or trusted him. He reminds me of people that I have worked very hard to keep in my past to the point that it's triggering, and being around him knowing that he has done these things makes me nearly sick to my stomach. There have been several times now that she has gotten tired of his behavior and cut him off, only to let him back in a few months later when he would come back, asking her to be a part of his life again while promising some sort of change.\n\nPart of the issue is that I was put in situations in which I would be forced to hang out with him. Me and her would be in her car, and she would tell me (not ask me) that we were going to hang out with Aiden and his friend \"Scott\" (19). She would not tell me until we were already on the way, and I had no way out of the situation. I voiced to her repeatedly that Aiden made me anxious and uneasy, and I did not want to be near him. Her response was always \"it'll be fine,\" or an eye roll followed by an \"I know.\" Eventually I gathered the courage to have a conversation about it with her in which I set the boundary of not being put in that situation again, no matter who is involved. She agreed and apologized, and I thought that was the end of it.\n\nThe same issue arose again the other night. I said again that Aiden makes me extremely uncomfortable, and refused to be in any situation to be surrounded by him in the future. I told her I can't control his place in her life, but I can control whether he has any place in mine. She tuned me out the whole time and even started texting him in the middle of it. In the end, she snapped at me and I got out of her car in tears.\n\nA few days later, she messaged me pertaining to the details of her grad dinner. Aiden, Scott, her and myself were going to have dinner with her family at her favorite restaurant. It took me way longer than I'm proud to admit to figure a response, but I reiterated what I had told her before and said I was sorry, but I was still not comfortable attending with him being there. She proceeded to curse at me, call me an asshole and brought my boyfriend into it while informing me for the first time that she apparently hates him. She has a right to be upset, and I recognize that, but I also feel that I am not completely wrong for holding firm on my boundary.\n\n(Sorry for the long context.. tried to give all I thought was necessary.)\n\nSo, Reddit.

Leave it open for her but tell her unless Aiden truly and actually changes you would prefer to keep your distance, yes that will probably ever things between you. But there's always a chance she'll come to realize Aiden will probably never change and you were right about him...a small chance, but it exists", "NTA\n\nCut her loose. She didn't respect your boundaries because she doesn't think you'll enforce them, or you'll cause a scene. \n\nIf she's really sorry, she'll apologise. You can evaluate the situation then. If she doesn't come crawling she wasn't a friend in the first place. \n\nAs it's guys she wants you to hang out with, I'd be doubly careful. Aiden sounds awful. Not the kind of person you'd want to be alone with or cross. Avoid.", "NTA. There\u2019s a reason you\u2019re uncomfortable around Aiden, he\u2019s verbally abusive. You\u2019re uncomfortable because you don\u2019t want to become an abuse victim. His or anyone else\u2019s victim, nor should you have to.\n\nProtect yourself, even if it means cutting Jordan from your life. She\u2019s enabling his abuse towards you by putting you in situations where you have to suffer his abuse, a real friend doesn\u2019t do that.\n\nLosing a shitty non-friend is a small price to pay for the safety of never seeing that man again.", "NTA", "Jordan is not your friend.

I\u2019ve asked her about it and she says it\u2019s nothing - he\u2019s always been pleasant with her, and me and him are very happy, so I\u2019ve just assumed that she\u2019s upset because she started seeing him as competition.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

But from what I see, that's not the case and you're expected to just always go against your feelings to please her.\n\nI've had friendships that disregarded my feelings and one thing I've learned after high school is that it's not just worth your peace of mind. I can only imagine how annoyed and hurt you must be to cater to your \"friend's\" needs while she ignores yours.\n\nFrom personal experience, she'll leave you behind as soon as she goes to college and finds someone more like her.\n\nIt's not your fault and I'm sorry, but the moment you say no to her she turns around and starts insulting and disrespecting you. You try to have a heart-to-heart with her and she texts other people??? Girlie, run...\n\nNo means no in all situations and not just sexual ones. Stand your ground.
