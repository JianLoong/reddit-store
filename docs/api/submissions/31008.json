In my opinion, there's no reason in trying to reduce the price ofsomething that's literally already costing like 2 USD. She tried to get boat ferries cheaper just because \"that's how these countries do\". I can't comprehend why anyone would try doing this as:  \n\n 1. It's a company organizing the ferries so a simple vendor can't just make a price up. \n\n 2. Even if, 100 baht less wont change anything in our budget.  I always feel so embrasassed by this. \n\nOn another instance she made a scene because when we got to destination after a van transfer there was a lady waiting to pick us up for free and bring us to our accomodations. The lady had to multiple times assure her it would be free of cost, and I had to talk to her for five minutes about how this lady is not going to abduct us and we could trust her. \n\nToday we got to Malaysia. She's hating it here, and literally not five minutes in the country she goes on a rant because she insist women are looked down on, don't have freedom and she just can't be in a country like this. And also the streets are too empty like wtf.  That's when I got really angry. I feel like the women here have a choice of wearing a hijab because it's part of the culture. But nobody gets obliged to do so, just as the women here can drive, vote and do everything else a normal human is entitled to. \nThat's when I called her a close minded racist, exposed all the facts and when she kept insisting I don't see how the women are treated here I got so angry, reminded her how women in Afghanistan have to live and stormed off. \n\nSo AITA? Or just over reacting? \n\nJudge on", "created_utc": 1700038340, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vpi2c/aita_for_saying_my_gf_is_close_minded_and_racist/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are women of other races, there are a lot of foreigners and expatriates as well. It's a really lovely country, shame she wants to put some dystopian lens on it.

There\u2019s almost certainly a better way to characterize her behavior. However, it\u2019s pretty clear that you\u2019re feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by her behavior \u2014 rightfully so. Her decision to take such strong stances on topics she\u2019s simply not educated on should be the focus here. \u201cForeigner prices\u201d are definitely a thing in parts of Asia, speaking from experience, but I can\u2019t speak for Thailand nor Malaysia.

I also don't think she is racist or closed minded and I think you're being a tad naive in your assessment of the situation. Yes I agree that haggling for everything and being so highly strung about safety can cause your gf to become a bit of an energy vampire. But, haggling is a part of culture in many countries and it seems that only Westerners are offended by it?! I also think you shouldn't be angry with her if she's worried about safety. Remember your privilege as a man to walk around in relative safety in most countries, you may not understand how she feels in that regard. \nFinally, I think her reaction to being in Malaysia is odd, you guys clearly had it on your itinerary so I don't know why she wouldn't have done research beforehand if she feels that strongly.

Just leave her over seas.", "NTA\n\nPeople haggling to save what to them is very little money is an annoying and bad habit of people visiting certain countries, and why choose to visit a country like Malaysia only to criticise the country for not fitting your standards.\n\nDid she not think to research the countries you'd be visiting beforehand and if so why visit if she's doesn't agree with the countries rules?\nIt's tourists like your Girlfriend that give other tourists like yourself a bad name with their constant moaning (I met a tourist fae California once who was visiting Scotland in the Winter and kept moaning it was cold and raining all the time, they acted like we changed the weather just to annoy them).", "NTA. I'm sorry your trip sucks :(", "YTA because she is mostly right and you are mostly wrong in the examples you\u2019ve given. \n\n1. Haggling is a part of the culture in that part of the world and they absolutely will offer a different starting price to a tourist vs a local - especially if you\u2019re white. The ferry example might be a bit much if it\u2019s a big one in a big city but if it\u2019s a smaller one and/or in a smaller place then it\u2019s worth a shot.\n\n2. She\u2019s not wrong to make sure everything is crystal clear regarding transportation, destination and price. Even if you\u2019re not worried about abduction, scams about taking you to the wrong place, like somewhere to spend money, or insisting on a tip are super common. For example, while in Bangkok with my wife we took a cab to a restaurant for an agreed price. The cabbie kept trying to renegotiate the price the whole way and also kept trying to take us to other restaurants. Luckily I had gps up on my phone so I could see he was going the wrong way. And then he said our restaurant was closed - as if he knew. And every restaurant he tried to was a know. And reported tourist trap/scam on TripAdvisor. He did this because he gets a kickback worth probably more than he makes in a day driving the car if he gets people there who eat.\n\n3. Women absolutely are treated much worse with far fewer freedoms and rights in all of Asia and particularly in Muslim counties. You think they have an individual choice about the hijab, but it\u2019s really up to her family. If the falsify says wear it - she wears it or she\u2019s on her own, or maybe even gets hurt.\n\n4. You sound very sheltered and inexperienced. Here\u2019s the truth - we in America have been so conditioned to believe that only whir people can be racist against others. Nothing could be further from the truth. The level of casual, shameless, and open racism in the rest of the world is like what you might expect to see in the early 1900s in the US. And they\u2019re not just racist against white people. For example, Asians in Asia are super racist against black and Latinos and really any group to which they don\u2019t personally belong.", "NTA, many foreigners assumed that Asian women are oppressed and can't stand up for themselves. This is definitely racist. \n\nI have met people who did humanitarian works in SE Asia, and felt the need to point out \"human rights\" issues to me immediately. Like LOL, have you looked at the state of your own country?", "NTA \n\nShe sounds exhausting. Maybe she should funnel all that energy into making her own country better rather than bitching about others.", "ESH.  Yes people do put foreignors prices and it annoys some people but not me.  And they do also hike the cost on official things in some places.\n\nI think your girlfriend would know better than you if women are looked down on in a country as she she's the one who would sense the difference in how SHE is treated.  It's like telling a black person who knows racism when they see it that you can't see it.  She's telling you about her experience.", "Agreed NTA.\n\nThis also happened to me while backpacking down the east coast of Africa; also with a girlfriend. Travel can bring out the worst in people but there are limits. About four months in when we were in Malawi I had had enough. I always knew she was high maintenance and whiney but racism and constant belittling of others was too much for me. I had pleaded with her for weeks to at least try and be tolerant but nothing changed. It was over. I had promised her parents I would look after her while we were travelling so I didn\u2019t feel I could just leave her overseas when we broke up. I offered to fly with her back to New Zealand - our home country - but she refused. Ended up flying with her to London and booked her into a youth hostel - I stayed one night with her in separate beds with two other people sleeping on the room - and left her. I have never looked back. That same year I met another girl backpacking in Tanzania. Last February was our 25th wedding anniversay and our grown up son is 22.", "I agree with your assessment.

Maybe she\u2019s feeling really uncomfortable and unsafe and it\u2019s coming out this way. \n\nThis does NOT mean it\u2019s okay by any means - racism and toxic negativity don\u2019t get a pass just because you\u2019re uncomfortable, but thought I\u2019d offer a slightly different perspective.

I have a couple of counter points... Which I'm gonna preface with OP's gf is a little extreme, and a little too negative/white privileged, but she's not totally wrong either. \n\nYes not all Muslims wear hijab, but we've had soooo many drama and scandals over Muslim women not wearing hijabs, from politicians to influences to school students. Chinese and Indians don't wear hijabs but government buildings require you to dress a certain way.\n\nYou say Malaysia is a very progressive country, lol I'm sorry, but it's not. Malaysia is a somewhat progressive country, for Asian and south east Asian standards it's great. Normal people to normal people in the city, yes there are more progressive people. Try and legalise gay marriage? Hah. And all these older generation especially in the government are another cause of lack of progress. Have you visited Singapore lately? Now that's more progressive. \n\n\"that's how they do things here\" referring to bargaining in Thailand, I sure did, I'm sure your friends did too. Esp at the tourist locations. \n\nJust cos the women in Malaysia don't walk behind men, are in government positions, etc, doesn't make Malaysia very progressive. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love many things about Malaysia, but Malaysia has a long way to go to be truly very progressive.

Reacting to your girlfriend expressing her views by calling her a \u201cclosed-minded racist\u201d is actually pretty childish and petulant (on this point, disliking the hijab as many Indonesian and Malaysian women do but feel compelled out of social norms, is not racist - I\u2019ve met a lot of young Indonesians who feel the same as your girlfriend.

Thailand is a country with an economy that generates billions every year from Chinese/Western tourists with restaurants and vendors that generate very good incomes from western tourists paying grossly inflated prices than those locals pay.

This is the Islamist playbook, that criticism of a gender-specific religious practice is \u201cracist\u201d. This is distinct from racism, which I should not need to define in the 21st century.
