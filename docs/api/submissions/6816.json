How old were you when you guys met?\n\nHe can't stand being with his own baby for more than 3 hours without being super stressed. Why does he think it's not the same for you?\n\nHere is why I'm never having kids!", "NTA. Y\u2019all need help. Get a babysitter or a mothers helper (a 10 year old who can watch the baby while you are still at home) or something. \n\nMy first thought is that sleep deprivation is a highly effective torture method. It messes with your ability to think critically, deal with stress, and of course patience. \n\nMy second thought is you both have very stressful jobs. The only difference is that when he comes home his \u201cjob\u201d as a healthcare professional is over. Your job is 24 hours a day. \n\nThird, you should be able to ask your partner to be able to watch their kid for ANY reason at all. There shouldn\u2019t be any score keeping, or quid pro quo. Parents need to parent, at all time. \n\nLast, the best advice I got for being a partner is to stop blaming one another for the problems. Instead figure out how to solve them. An example might be instead of saying \u201cyou\u2019ve left a huge mess in the kitchen\u201d say \u201cthis kitchen needs cleaning.\u201d  No one\u2019s fault, both partners vs. the problem.", "NTA. The baby has two parents. You\u2019re not asking him to babysit, you\u2019re asking him to be a parent.", "Age gap, young baby that the barely-no-longer-a-teenager wife does almost 100% of the care for and has no money for herself, pregnant again because everyone\u2019s burnt out so why not add another one to the mix, older husband who think she\u2019s lazy but refuses to help with anything, and certainly some financial control sprinkled on top\u2026..bingo!", "NTA. Hand him that baby and leave for a day. Go visit a friend or just go out for a day. Hell shape up REAL fast", "NTA- You said he gets overwhelmed after being with the baby for 3 hours but thinks you are lazy because the house isn\u2019t spotless after you spend literally the entire day with the baby? Why does he get to play video games while you don\u2019t get a break. Ask your husband if he wants to switch. You can go out into the world with other adults while he starts home with a child who literally does not sleep. Point out that you don\u2019t tell him how to do his job. In fact, the only reason he is able to do his job is because you are home taking care of his child. He gets a full night of sleep because of you. \n\nAdditionally, how is he a good dad if he can\u2019t spend more than 3 hours caring for his child and doesn\u2019t get up in the night?", "100% NTA, but I think you knew this already. I experience the same thing to a certain degree.  I really don't know why it's so hard for men to grasp how difficult and draining it is to take care of even just one child. But because we don't get paid for this it automatically equals lazy, not working. All it would take is one day with your responsibilities to realize how much more difficult it is. Your husband needs to realize that he shares responsibility for your home and family as well. Naturally we stay at home mums will take on more of the burden of home care, but that absolutely doesn't mean ALL of the home work. He may work long hard hours, but it's still nowhere near as many hours as you have to work. Your work never ends. Ask him why he only has to be responsible for one thing (making money) and you are burdened with everything that remains. You are not a slave, and fathers need to do more than just provide financial support. If he thinks that's all he needs to contribute then hes sorely misinformed and might as well not even be married. If he doesn't wanna take any further care of his family beyond that, and believes he is entitled to your service just because he works, you can get divorced and he can pay child support. Otherwise, he needs to do more, because money is just one small factor that plays into being a good parent and partner.", "Nta. He may work but he isn't working while carrying a baby on his hip.  \n\nBeing a stay at home parent is A 24 hr job. You don't get a break. You're on the clock 24/7 I'd your partner isn't helping. You do all the chores too. Some days I myself don't get much done because my toddler is in a clingy mood. He needs to understand that Just because you are home doesn't mean  you are not working.", "NTA, But I've found you aren't going to be able to \"make\" him do anything he doesn't want to do. Find something to keep baby safe (playpen, swing, play mat... may depend partly on what baby can do)  and with baby safe (even if he fusses, to a point. Half an hour of being unhappy isn't going to hurt baby)  so you can get a few things done.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2018re both burnt out, but his assumption that you don\u2018t work and are lazy makes him a huge AH, especially since you probably have the harder job as you have a baby to take care of AND are pregnant.\n\nHonestly, he\u2018s just not a capable father or partner, and I doubt he could handle your mental and physical load even when he works hard himself, so he\u2018s clearly in the wrong here and not a good match.", "NTA. \n\nBut in the long run you\u2019ll both be AH. It won\u2019t get easier with two babies, or the third trimester\u2026. You both need to get people involved to lighten the load.

He needs to step up and be a parent.", "DAFUQ?? Is this serious??\n\nNTA. He's an entitled jerk, though. There's really nothing more to say.", "NTA at all. Since you\u2019re both overwhelmed & stressed, can you hire a cleaner & pay for someone to do the laundry? Or hire a nanny/babysitter a few hours a day so you can get some uninterrupted sleep? Or hire someone to come in once a week (or better yet, once a month) to grocery shop/cook/freeze meals?", "NTA. At all. He needs to help with the baby. End of story.", "Yes. You should hire a nanny or something to help out", "NTA.  He should help out whether it be watching the baby for a few hours so you can get stuff done, or he can clean the kitchen or do laundry while you watch the baby.  It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking him to quit his job and stay home all day with you and the baby. You\u2019re asking for a few hours. Yes, your job during the day, while he\u2019s at his other job, is to care for the baby,  but once he\u2019s home, that also becomes his job, as it is a 24/7 gig and you\u2019re both the parents.", "NTA. You had a baby with a narcissist and this is what that looks like. It's the stereotypical narcissist father of an infant scenario outcome.\n\nThe rest of the stereotype is that you have another baby with him and then experience the same thing again.\n\nBreak the cycle. You can do this bullshit by yourself because you already are. Nobody should ever be in a relationship with a narcissist.", "INFO: What the cost of living has to do with the rest of your story? And is he telling the trust about his finances? There is absolutely no way in the UK you are left with less than half the pay after tax and NI.

He should ALSO pitch in with cleaning and taking care of the baby.\n\nJust because he works doesn\u2019t mean he can wash his hands of any responsibility when it comes to watching his kid. It takes two to make a baby, he needs to be involved.", "You and your husband are both overworked, burned out and sleep deprived.  Ignore anyone commenting that you're not compatible or need a divorce.  All couples go through this with a new baby; some babies are \"worse\" than others (in terms of their sleep, personality and needs) and being pregnant with a second child, whilst a questionable decision, isn't going to make this any easier for you. Babies strain relationships.\n\nWith regards your husband; it sounds like he is using avoidance and blame shifting to assuage his responsibilities.  You need to sit down together whilst your baby is napping and work out a slot for him to be involved with the baby each day - even if you're present at the same time.  He's not going to bond with his child if he never interacts. \n\nWith regards to yourself and your safety net; in the UK we have a wealth of free baby groups.  Most of them were suspended over quarantine but have reopened now.  A lot of them are held in church halls, scout huts, libraries or community centres - and are FREE. There are also other classes which are low cost but paid for, both during the week and on weekends.  Baby sign language, rhymes and singing, stories, free-play, etc. Get on your local Facebook and find out what's on offer and when. \n\nThe people who attend and run these classes are going through our have been through all this and will have empathy and advice. They will give you the space you need from your child AND give you some adult conversation and a chance to express yourself. \n\nLook at day care facilities near you.  Having a couple of mornings a week without your baby whilst your child learns socialisation skills from their peers is important for both of you. Children learn faster from watching other children than watching adults, plus benefit from early socialisation later on in life when navigating school friendships. \n\nAll SAHP get overwhelmed and burned out, especially if their partners refuse to acknowledge how hard they work. You're not at fault here. Find yourself some local resources and get yourself some support.\n\nETA: OP found my comment helpful so downvote all you like lol", "Nta", "NTA - tell him you\u2019re going to hire a cleaner if he can\u2019t find his way through his thick fog of exhaustion to tend to the baby for an hour or two while you clean.", "NTA Don't give him the option of refusing, give him the baby and go out for the day. I'm sure his opinion would rapidly change.", "NTA. For this.\nBut 100000% YTA for bringing another child into this mess...\nGet therapy.", "YTA. You admit that your partner is burned out yet you expect him to take on even more work and stress. You further admit that he **already** takes the baby at times but him working a stressful, long hours job *with night shifts and mandatory continuing professional development* **and** handling all of the household finances himself **and** pitching in to help with the baby some of the time *just isn't good enough for you*. Whereas you have allowed your home to become a biohazard.\n\n>I love being a mum but I cannot take the stress of being the childcare, cleaner, cook, laundrette, and focusing on my appearance too.\n\nWhy do you need to focus on your appearance when you're just a stay-at-home mom? Why would you even *bother* when there's a good chance your baby will just throw up on you in an hour anyway?

I spend all night comforting and nursing him so he will sleep.\n\nHave you tried ignoring the baby at night?

You go out for a walk or something, \n\n6. Eat together wash up together tidy and then he can bath baby. \n\n7. Baby down . Getting up all night is ridiculous . He doesn\u2019t need you . Ignore him unless he\u2019s in danger. My niece and nephew never slept until they came to mine once . I ignored them and they went back to bed and slept, wow. \n\nWhen you can start baby groups do it. Baby swim really tired babies out,", "You\u2019re so not alone. It\u2019s such a tough time. You\u2019re a team and it feels hard to remember that (or your own name) right now. You both want a long happy life together, so how can you work to get there? Here\u2019s how we\u2019re surviving with an 8mo and toddler: \n\n1) 10h/day we\u2019re both working. My work is keeping our child alive while sleep deprived, my partner\u2019s work is keeping other people alive. Anything I manage above that is nice to have. It\u2019s called maternity/parental leave, not parental and cooking leave, so we have lots of chats to redefine the minimum standard we can both live with. It doesn\u2019t get easier with two. If you\u2019re a reader a book called Fair Play was helpful. There\u2019s a sweet little poem too: Cooking and cleaning can wait till tomorrow because babies grow up we\u2019ve learned to our sorrow, so quiet down cobwebs and dust go to sleep I\u2019m rocking my baby because babies don\u2019t keep  \n\n2) I have one evening off a week and I make my partner do the same. I sign up for a class or go to a dinner with a friend or see a therapist or go for a walk and cry, but I am alone. My child will cry, but I\u2019m modelling self care for them, and my partner will survive. The world will not collapse and neither will I. \n\n3) We have one date night every second week just so we can congratulate ourselves on not getting divorced (ha)\n\n4) We outsource everything we can and all our money goes to helping the family stay sane right now: I do click and collect groceries so I can meal plan and order while I breastfeed or do Hello Fresh if that feels like too much. We do a cleaner for 5h every 2 weeks. We use a drop in creche (maybe a local gym has one?) We tell our friends and godparents and whomever we need help and how and when. When things get really bad we have a babysitter who can just come and take the baby for a walk so I can sleep. We have just paid for a sleep trainer. Yes these things cost a lot but they cost less than divorce - this year we\u2019re doing these things and not going on holiday, doing presents for bday/Xmas, etc. Nothing is more important than your sanity - if you have an accident while driving because you are so sleep deprived the dirty bin bags will look like a non-issue. You shouldn\u2019t need to spell that out. \n \nThis isn\u2019t a YOU problem, you\u2019re just at breaking point, it\u2019s a FAMILY problem. Oh and yes, you need a new sleep trainer, asap. My LO was up 6-10x/night until 7m and now it\u2019s once a night - we used Emma Gehan in the U.K. Good luck.", "Why oh why did you guys decide to have another baby? Yikes. As someone who had a baby who was up all night, I totally feel you. My daughter was like that. Literally up more during the night than she was asleep. And then a ton of energy during the day. For like a year and a half before she started only waking a few times a night, lol. It WILL get better eventually! But your husband is a doctor, he can afford either a maid once a week, or a babysitter a few times a week. Or both honestly. I do think he needs to step up as well, but he has a lot on his plate as well. Give him the option of watching baby for 2 hours every day after work or you hiring a helper, see which he chooses", "Nobody sucks here. Its just a shitty situation. Id love to offer a bit of advice that works for me if thats ok. Even though I breastfeed, I give a fat bottle of formula before bed and it gets me a solid few hours of sleep. Also, during the day, wearing the baby is so helpful. And please remember this phase isn't going to last forever. Good luck!", "Posting this question to AITA is only going to find the toxic AH's. Maybe try r/parenting. The amount of down votes you have for comments astounds me. People love to judge other people's lives. F those people. Besides to know how to help in this situation you really need to have walked that life. One can imagine a tough week studying for finals and try to apply that to your situation but in vain. It's like being a brain surgeon asking to advice from the janitor. Different worlds.\n\nYes, your husband is doing you dirty. No, you are not an AH for trying to survive!\n\nI have been and am where you are. I am a stay at home mom with an 18 month old and I'm 6 months pregnant. \n\nMy first slept awful the first nine months causing me to get maybe 3 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period- every damn day for months. I was being tortured by my own baby. Slowly dying and petrified that my sleeplessness would harm her in some way. During the day she fussed constantly and wanted to be held almost the whole time. For her every cry I was there to nurse her back down. Poor baby was as sleep deprived as I. But I was so tired that I couldn't help myself and my husband needed to be 'protected' (my words) so he could get sleep to maintain a job. He didn't have a clue what was happening because he compartmentalized that it was my job. Plus when she was born he was overwhelmed for the first 4 months and could barely hold her cause once she started crying he would freak and hand her back to me. He didn't try. \n\nAt 9 months I broke down in many ways and bought a crib (I was co-sleeping). That night we put it together and I let her cry it out until one night feed at 4am. She was a healthy weight, warm and safe. I didn't need to be with her. The first night wasn't as bad as I thought. Put her down and didn't go back in. She cried for less than 10 minutes. The next night was almost perfect. I slept and she slept. Finally my fussy baby was chill and less clingy. That was what brought the best change in my life since having her. She's still a very active, needy child. \n\nI see you are working with a sleep specialist. Awesome. Rip that bandaid off and let your baby cry it out. Put baby in crib and walk away. Put in ear plugs. You are dying. I was the type that said if the baby is crying it's because they need me. I learned otherwise. You also need to teach them how to be alone and also that it's okay if they wake during sleep and how to go back down by themselves. The average adult wakes 10-12 times throughout the night but somehow we know how to go back down. You need to help teach that. \n\nThis will change everything!\n\nEven after I got my baby to sleep for 10 or more hours (straight! She will wake maybe once to cry for a moment then go back down) I still didn't have the hands to clean the house properly. She still wants all my attention and is now of the anti-helpsr stage undoing everything I just cleaned. I tried getting my husband to take her even for a walk in the stroller. He would fuss and complain worse than her. And I think he's a good Dad. I'm trying to undo poor expectations from his parents. It's a daily fight but routine works. Yes, I am having to break down how to be a good helper to him like he is a toddler. A plate can sit on his desk for days and it will be er occur to him to take it to the sink nonetheless put it in the dishwasher. Why? He was never forced to care about it as a child. Things I will do differently for my children. \n\nIn the end, our fights produced very little. He hired a cleaning crew and that was amazing. Best thing he did. Wish I did it sooner. Just someone to clean the kitchen and bathrooms. They relieved so much stress and then I could focus on other areas. Highly suggest doing so. Hell, if your in laws don't have the energy for a high needs baby can they clean while you wear the baby out? Personally I would rather not have family do the cleaning but any help is help. \n\nGetting help with baby is a whole other matter. If we were going to have to have a second I needed to be near family that could help. Since we were 7+ hours from family and I didn't feel comfortable with hiring anyone, we needed to move near his parents who are everything one could ask for in grandparents. Hence, I'm 6 months pregnant. Meaning he needed to find a new job that was closer (it's WFH) and bought a new house. Huge, life changing changes for about 10 hours a week of help. Finally I have two retired people that adore her and will give me several hours at a time to do what I want. Which means sleeping and cleaning. It was what needed to be done for the better of the family. \n\n\nYou are pregnant. Your body is exhausted. If your husband can understand one thing it's the medical needs of a pregnancy. It's black and white. He needs to answer how he is helping to support those biological demands. In the end, it means he needs to give you time by yourself to heal and recover. \n\nMaybe find a playdate he could do with coworkers by himself or maybe a library time for babies he could do. At worst or as a second option, finding another mom who is willing to trade who watches the kid while the one cleans their own home. There are a million options but you need to be willing to try them. \n\nYou can't rely on your husband to figure it out. I couldn't and still think he's a good Dad and husband. You need to come up with a game plan. And mean it. You are the brain surgeon in this situation asking for help from janitor (redditors) and a husband who is squeamish just thinking about a brain. You need to fix your sleep which means fix babies sleep- first and foremost. Once you do that then being able to think clearly will be easier. It's time to step up- this is your Rudy moment (movie reference to the movie Rudy). You have been asking for help from anyone, everyone to no avail. Time to take control. Come up with a realistic ideal and break it down into steps. Then tell those around you what you need in baby steps. Noting back to my comment about teaching my husband how to be helpful in toddler ways. Be clear and expect nothing less. \n\nAnd yes he is an asshole for not seeing that being a dad requires him to do something when he's not at work. For instance, my husband and I trade who gets up with our baby in the morning so the other can sleep. Among many other ways to equalize the parenting when he's not at work. I see it that my 'work' hours are the same as my husband's. Then everything else is fair game. Meaning if one day someone needs more time to themselves then the other steps up. It needs to be noted, we aren't perfect. We still fight. And I still carry the heaviest burden. Since he is willing to change and help me, we will be ok in the end. Babies change the entire balance of a family. You now need to find that equalizer and once a second baby comes and a new balance will be needed. \n\nCommit to a healthy life for everyone in your family. You are the boss and they are in your business. No one else is doing it. You have to. And things need to change. This is not beyond you. \n\nIf you continue on as you are, once baby comes what will be left of you? Asking your husband hasn't worked. You need to think out of the box. Or it will become your grave. \n\n\nGood luck", "NTA. Taking care of a kid and being pregnant is 23/7 work. \n\nHe should be cleaning. End of story.", ">Our last argument was me begging for help.

Idk if it'll help or not but I made myself a daily chart of things to do so I could see I was making progress every day and so that I didn't feel so overwhelmed or have to think so much. It would be something easy like:\n\nMonday: wipe down kitchen counters, clean toilet, do clothes laundry\nTuesday: clean floors in bathroom and kitchen, clean surfaces in living room, do towels laundry\nWednesday: dust, clean kitchen table, clean kitchen appliances, water plants\nThursday: clean floors in rest of house, dust office....\n\n\nEtc etc. The point was to do a little each day in different areas so it's not overwhelming, but your house will always be getting clean in an area.

What he doesn't understand (or doesn't want to acknowledge) is that while he's \"only\" getting 6 hours of sleep and 2 hours of leisure time, you're over here getting 2 hours of sleep and 0 hours of leisure. And that is why you need help. You are NTA . \n\nThe only other suggestion I have (other than some of the excellent ones made here, such as to find some outside help) is to ask if you have a baby carrier? That was the only way I got anything done when my son was small. There are some tasks you can't do with baby in the carrier (anything involving a pot of boiling water, etc.) But there's an awful lot of stuff you can bop around the house and do, taking the baby with you and keeping your hands free. My son LOVED being worn. From his POV he was with Mom and was being \"held,\" so he was just as happy as when I was sitting on the couch holding him with my arms.

And I will put earplugs in and not get up with him at night as well!\"\n\nIf I sound unkind my first child, a son did NOT SLEEP EVER! And his pediatrician did not believe me. Guess what? He has been seeing a sleep specialist as an adult because he cannot sleep. \n\nI used to put him in the baby swing and weep as I was so exhausted. And I never bonded to him. He was fussy as well. And a poor feeder.\n\nTurns out that he had a hiatal ulcer. this can interfere with both sleep and feeding. \n\nIf your son falls asleep when he is sitting up, this is a sign that there may be stomach issues. If he screams and fusses lying flat, it may be because he has stomach acid eating into his esophagus. \n\nBest of luck.\n\nNTA.", "I think you\u2019re both the AH. I raised two kids and I had one who was particularly challenging as a baby. You really need to put the baby down some for a couple of reasons- first, you\u2019ve got another one on the way (bad decision) and baby #1 is going to have to get used to not being held and nursed 24/7; and second, aesthetics aside, you and your family need to live in basic cleanliness. Your husband certainly needs to do his part, and the whole relationship sounds weird, but life is about to get harder. Once the second baby comes, you will see how much easier life is with one child than two. Y\u2019all have created these children together- figure out how to care for them together. I highly recommend a list or calendar of tasks that need to be completed. Crossing things off as they are completed is satisfying, and a list will provide structure for your day. Best of luck to you.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, super awesome hint from a dad of two- get the tiny bags they use to store Dog poop and put diapers in those. They work better at holding the stink than any other bags I have ever found, and are usually SUPER Cheap. I used to get them for $1.99 for 3 rolls of 100 when my kids were babies. Even if the price has tripled in 10 years, it would still be a bargain", "NTA. I\u2019m in the same boat with my fianc\u00e9 but unfortunately he isn\u2019t a doctor and I work full time (and make more). Since I work from home I currently have the baby during the day as well because daycare is hard to come by and expensive af ($20k a year for a center). When I try to talk to him he just doesn\u2019t get it, even my therapist is like \u201cdamn. He\u2019s dense\u201d. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t tried it already, a weighted sleep sack may help. My little guy (4months) was still staying up till 1230-130am and then waking every 2-3 hours. I just got the sack this last Wednesday and he\u2019s gone to sleep around 11:30-12:30am but sleeping till 7:45-8:45am without waking. They\u2019re around $50 but honestly I\u2019d pay $200 for one for the magic that it is.", "I feel for you being a new parent is hard, and 12 times a night sounds terrible. I don't know how old your little one is but I'd be bugging the health visitors like crazy so find out what you can do so you feel less overwhelmed. I would say it's okay to leave your baby in a safe place for 5 minutes to quickly get something done, it just made me feel that bit better myself getting one task done and gave me a needed break from the baby. That or will your baby let you get stuff done in a sling?! It didn't work for me tbh but I know it does for some.\n\nNAH you just need help.

This sounds like what you need and its pretty affordable compared to a nanny", "He impregnated a 19 year old with a history of abuse.  Who he had started dating when he was 28 and she was 17. \n He's also in control of the financials.", "OP, of any of the doctors at my work were acting as your husband does then I would lose all respect for them. As colleagues *and* as people. This is not how healthy relationships work.\n\nAnd while I realize this wasn't your initial concern, it adds some really unfortunate context to consider your ages. He was older than I am, and knockong boots with a 17-18 year old. The concept of that makes me ill. How can your husband possibly be trusted with the care of vulnerable persons? He couldn't even be trusted with taking care of *you*!", "It\u2019s Shroedinger\u2019s Baby. The baby is both hard to take care of and easy to take care of depending on the argument that needs to be made.

Not a full hour but he could manage 30 minutes doing that and taking a little care of it", "One of my children did not sleep through the night until they were 7. Until age 4 they'd wake up at least 3 times a night. I was a zombie for years and I'm still traumatized by it. Now, they are a successful professional but have very particular sleep needs.
