How old were you when you guys met?\n\nHe can't stand being with his own baby for more than 3 hours without being super stressed. Why does he think it's not the same for you?\n\nHere is why I'm never having kids!", "NTA. Y\u2019all need help. Get a babysitter or a mothers helper (a 10 year old who can watch the baby while you are still at home) or something. \n\nMy first thought is that sleep deprivation is a highly effective torture method. It messes with your ability to think critically, deal with stress, and of course patience. \n\nMy second thought is you both have very stressful jobs. The only difference is that when he comes home his \u201cjob\u201d as a healthcare professional is over. Your job is 24 hours a day. \n\nThird, you should be able to ask your partner to be able to watch their kid for ANY reason at all. There shouldn\u2019t be any score keeping, or quid pro quo. Parents need to parent, at all time. \n\nLast, the best advice I got for being a partner is to stop blaming one another for the problems. Instead figure out how to solve them. An example might be instead of saying \u201cyou\u2019ve left a huge mess in the kitchen\u201d say \u201cthis kitchen needs cleaning.\u201d  No one\u2019s fault, both partners vs. the problem.", "NTA. The baby has two parents. You\u2019re not asking him to babysit, you\u2019re asking him to be a parent.", "Age gap, young baby that the barely-no-longer-a-teenager wife does almost 100% of the care for and has no money for herself, pregnant again because everyone\u2019s burnt out so why not add another one to the mix, older husband who think she\u2019s lazy but refuses to help with anything, and certainly some financial control sprinkled on top\u2026..bingo!", "NTA. Hand him that baby and leave for a day. Go visit a friend or just go out for a day. Hell shape up REAL fast", "NTA- You said he gets overwhelmed after being with the baby for 3 hours but thinks you are lazy because the house isn\u2019t spotless after you spend literally the entire day with the baby? Why does he get to play video games while you don\u2019t get a break. Ask your husband if he wants to switch. You can go out into the world with other adults while he starts home with a child who literally does not sleep. Point out that you don\u2019t tell him how to do his job. In fact, the only reason he is able to do his job is because you are home taking care of his child. He gets a full night of sleep because of you. \n\nAdditionally, how is he a good dad if he can\u2019t spend more than 3 hours caring for his child and doesn\u2019t get up in the night?", "100% NTA, but I think you knew this already. I experience the same thing to a certain degree.  I really don't know why it's so hard for men to grasp how difficult and draining it is to take care of even just one child. But because we don't get paid for this it automatically equals lazy, not working. All it would take is one day with your responsibilities to realize how much more difficult it is. Your husband needs to realize that he shares responsibility for your home and family as well. Naturally we stay at home mums will take on more of the burden of home care, but that absolutely doesn't mean ALL of the home work. He may work long hard hours, but it's still nowhere near as many hours as you have to work. Your work never ends. Ask him why he only has to be responsible for one thing (making money) and you are burdened with everything that remains. You are not a slave, and fathers need to do more than just provide financial support. If he thinks that's all he needs to contribute then hes sorely misinformed and might as well not even be married. If he doesn't wanna take any further care of his family beyond that, and believes he is entitled to your service just because he works, you can get divorced and he can pay child support. Otherwise, he needs to do more, because money is just one small factor that plays into being a good parent and partner.", "Nta. He may work but he isn't working while carrying a baby on his hip.  \n\nBeing a stay at home parent is A 24 hr job. You don't get a break. You're on the clock 24/7 I'd your partner isn't helping. You do all the chores too. Some days I myself don't get much done because my toddler is in a clingy mood. He needs to understand that Just because you are home doesn't mean  you are not working.", "NTA, But I've found you aren't going to be able to \"make\" him do anything he doesn't want to do. Find something to keep baby safe (playpen, swing, play mat... may depend partly on what baby can do)  and with baby safe (even if he fusses, to a point. Half an hour of being unhappy isn't going to hurt baby)  so you can get a few things done.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2018re both burnt out, but his assumption that you don\u2018t work and are lazy makes him a huge AH, especially since you probably have the harder job as you have a baby to take care of AND are pregnant.\n\nHonestly, he\u2018s just not a capable father or partner, and I doubt he could handle your mental and physical load even when he works hard himself, so he\u2018s clearly in the wrong here and not a good match.", "NTA. \n\nBut in the long run you\u2019ll both be AH. It won\u2019t get easier with two babies, or the third trimester\u2026. You both need to get people involved to lighten the load. Reach out to the family / infant & family team, neighbours, charity, community, paternity. leave, whatever you can get your hands on.\n\nStrong parents = strong children.\n\nBoth parents are struggling here\u2026 How can you provide safety and shelter if all you two are doing is being at each other\u2019s throats\u2026.\n\nIf your partner won\u2019t support you soon, you can go back to your abusive family, because your partner is pretty abusive too.", "NTA, Sorry he is so unsupportive and totally clueless about what day to day life taking care of a baby and keeping a home I'd like. \n\nYou guys need to have some really big and important discussions.", "NAh but stop having kids when you guys can\u2019t even handle the one you already have.", "NTA\n\nHaving a baby is hard and stressful, esp one that won't sleep. He needs to step up and be a parent.", "DAFUQ?? Is this serious??\n\nNTA. He's an entitled jerk, though. There's really nothing more to say.", "NTA at all. Since you\u2019re both overwhelmed & stressed, can you hire a cleaner & pay for someone to do the laundry? Or hire a nanny/babysitter a few hours a day so you can get some uninterrupted sleep? Or hire someone to come in once a week (or better yet, once a month) to grocery shop/cook/freeze meals?", "NTA. At all. He needs to help with the baby. End of story.", "Yes. You should hire a nanny or something to help out", "NTA.  He should help out whether it be watching the baby for a few hours so you can get stuff done, or he can clean the kitchen or do laundry while you watch the baby.  It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking him to quit his job and stay home all day with you and the baby. You\u2019re asking for a few hours. Yes, your job during the day, while he\u2019s at his other job, is to care for the baby,  but once he\u2019s home, that also becomes his job, as it is a 24/7 gig and you\u2019re both the parents.", "NTA. You had a baby with a narcissist and this is what that looks like. It's the stereotypical narcissist father of an infant scenario outcome.\n\nThe rest of the stereotype is that you have another baby with him and then experience the same thing again.\n\nBreak the cycle. You can do this bullshit by yourself because you already are. Nobody should ever be in a relationship with a narcissist.", "INFO: What the cost of living has to do with the rest of your story? And is he telling the trust about his finances? There is absolutely no way in the UK you are left with less than half the pay after tax and NI. If he makes \u00a350,000 p.a., his take-home is about \u00a337,000. If he makes \u00a340,000 his take-home is \u00a331,000.

He should ALSO pitch in with cleaning and taking care of the baby.\n\nJust because he works doesn\u2019t mean he can wash his hands of any responsibility when it comes to watching his kid. It takes two to make a baby, he needs to be involved.", "You and your husband are both overworked, burned out and sleep deprived.  Ignore anyone commenting that you're not compatible or need a divorce.  All couples go through this with a new baby; some babies are \"worse\" than others (in terms of their sleep, personality and needs) and being pregnant with a second child, whilst a questionable decision, isn't going to make this any easier for you. Babies strain relationships.\n\nWith regards your husband; it sounds like he is using avoidance and blame shifting to assuage his responsibilities.  You need to sit down together whilst your baby is napping and work out a slot for him to be involved with the baby each day - even if you're present at the same time.  He's not going to bond with his child if he never interacts. \n\nWith regards to yourself and your safety net; in the UK we have a wealth of free baby groups.  Most of them were suspended over quarantine but have reopened now.  A lot of them are held in church halls, scout huts, libraries or community centres - and are FREE. There are also other classes which are low cost but paid for, both during the week and on weekends.  Baby sign language, rhymes and singing, stories, free-play, etc. Get on your local Facebook and find out what's on offer and when. \n\nThe people who attend and run these classes are going through our have been through all this and will have empathy and advice. They will give you the space you need from your child AND give you some adult conversation and a chance to express yourself. \n\nLook at day care facilities near you.  Having a couple of mornings a week without your baby whilst your child learns socialisation skills from their peers is important for both of you. Children learn faster from watching other children than watching adults, plus benefit from early socialisation later on in life when navigating school friendships. \n\nAll SAHP get overwhelmed and burned out, especially if their partners refuse to acknowledge how hard they work. You're not at fault here. Find yourself some local resources and get yourself some support.\n\nETA: OP found my comment helpful so downvote all you like lol", "Nta", "NTA - tell him you\u2019re going to hire a cleaner if he can\u2019t find his way through his thick fog of exhaustion to tend to the baby for an hour or two while you clean.", "NTA Don't give him the option of refusing, give him the baby and go out for the day. I'm sure his opinion would rapidly change.", "NTA. For this.\nBut 100000% YTA for bringing another child into this mess...\nGet therapy.", "YTA. You admit that your partner is burned out yet you expect him to take on even more work and stress. You further admit that he **already** takes the baby at times but him working a stressful, long hours job *with night shifts and mandatory continuing professional development* **and** handling all of the household finances himself **and** pitching in to help with the baby some of the time *just isn't good enough for you*. Whereas you have allowed your home to become a biohazard.\n\n>I love being a mum but I cannot take the stress of being the childcare, cleaner, cook, laundrette, and focusing on my appearance too.\n\nWhy do you need to focus on your appearance when you're just a stay-at-home mom? Why would you even *bother* when there's a good chance your baby will just throw up on you in an hour anyway?

I spend all night comforting and nursing him so he will sleep.\n\nHave you tried ignoring the baby at night?

Your job is 24 hours and relentless, and your husband should be stepping up to take more responsibility. Having said that most doctors are sailing pretty close to the wind in terms of burnout at the moment. Additionally if he\u2019s studying it means he\u2019s a junior doctor so the pressure is intense to pass exams and complete assessments (and that\u2019s not even considering he\u2019s in a competitive specialty which requires a lot more CV buffing outside of work).

It's been a long time). \n\n\nDo you have a dishwasher? If not maybe see about getting one. The same with a tumble dryer. Just see what convenience appliances you can get to make your life easier.
