When I told her I didn't know anything about his death, let alone the funeral, her response was \"Well there was a Facebook post, you should have seen it.\"\n\nAfter this conversation, I asked her to give me some time to process everything I just learned, and she continued to get upset that I didn't ask about how the family was doing since they all moved to Texas. I said I'm sorry but I need time to process and hung up.\n\nI then took a couple of hours before I decided to check Facebook and the supposed post. It did exist, and it had all of my family tagged. Except me. Every cousin, second cousin twice removed, etc. Everyone but me. And on top of that, since my entire family lived in upper Texas and Oklahoma, they decided to make the post the day before the funeral. \n\nSince then, I've received multiple calls from various family members, all of which I've ignored.

And what kind of mother doesn\u2019t bother to check with their kid ahead of the funeral if they\u2019re going to have to travel in from out of town? Your family sound pretty awful, OP. :(", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019m sorry for your loss and hope you\u2019re doing well. \n\nI\u2019d be pretty shocked too if I found out someone significant in my life had passed and I didn\u2019t find out until after the funeral. That should\u2019ve been a phone call to you at most a day or two after the death at the minimum. \n\nOn the other hand, don\u2019t blame them. Your parents are probably going through it pretty hard right now, I mean, it was their parents who died. Yeah, you may have been forgotten about in the Facebook post, but that seems like an accident since they called you when they saw you were absent. \n\nWhen it comes to hanging up/ignoring the calls coming in, you could\u2019ve handled that a little better, but I believe you\u2019re still NTA because learning that you lost someone and can\u2019t grieve at their funeral is kinda fucked. \n\nI hope that when things calm down you and your mom can have a conversation about what happened so any sort of anger can be dealt with.", "NTA. Can you respond to the facebook group:\n\n\"I'm deeply sad that i could not attend the funeral. But I'm also deeply hurt because no one told me he passed away. And no one included me in this facebook group. Please leave me alone right now so that I can grieve. Unlike tge rest of you, i did not get a chance to say goodbye.\"", "NTA. Finding out about a loved one\u2019s death on social media is cruel. \n\nShe should have called you ASAP.", "NTA\n\nfirst off OP, Sorry for your loss. \n\nSecondly, in my opinion Facebook is NOT a viable place to be letting people know important things like that. Any one of them could've called you or texted you that your grandfather died, and they just assumed you would see a post they didn't even tag you in. They are responsible for communicating this and the fact that they blame you for not knowing is incredulous. Regardless of Grief Brain.", "NTA.  Not telling you directly, and then chastising you for not being there, is some pro-level passive-aggressive bullshit.  Everyone who had your number - including your dear mother - should be ashamed of themselves, and you can deal with this in any way you please, and you have all the good reasons to tell them to go pound sand.", "NTA in any way.", "NTA\n\nYou don't inform about the death of a loved one via facebook!!!\n\nWhen the grandparents of my children would die, I'd call them immediately and don't rely on them checking social media.\n\nHow tacky is this?!?", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.\n\nWtf is wrong with them & their lack of communication?

Please remember they were grieving too.   I heard after a family funeral that people were mad because they were not notified.  We did not have the time, energy or wherewithal to notify people.  There was an obituary and one of the deceased's friends spread the word.  When you are dealing with someone passing, helping their spouse, making funeral arrangements, dealing with others grieving and trying to help them, making arrangements for the after service, cleaning, buying necessities, etc., it is just overwhelming even if you have people helping.  You were probably left off the post because someone's mind went blank and they had that, \"I know I'm missing something\" feeling.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss, and sorry your family didn't even inform you in time for you to go to the funeral.", "For the most part, this is how I feel about it. Thankfully, I was able to take the rest of the week off work, so I'm spending the time with my fianc\u00e9e and daughter. My ringer is off, and we are currently looking at when we will be able to at least visit his grave. Thank you for your condolences.", "I appreciate the insight, im not angry really, just upset how the situation played out. I know I should answer cause they are all grieving too, but its hard for me right now because I don't really know what I would say to them right now. I know it'll pass, at the end of the day, it's family.", "Also, oddly enough I live in the Texoma area (SWOK) and I\u2019ve never seen a post so close to where I live.", "FB is so notorious for its algorithms not showing people posts even when they're tagged that it's hardly a reliable medium for communicating something as significant as a death in the family. Also they forgot to tag you.\n\nNTA.", "Why wouldn't your mom have called you too tell you personally about the death? NTA", "NTA. I truly don\u2019t understand how Facebook became the primary communication method for very important things such as death and funerals. Same exact situation happened in my family. Those family members were not on speaking terms thereafter. \n\nSomeone should have called you directly. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "Well, it's a mother I still love. It hurts, for sure, and there will definitely need time and effort for mending, but regardless of how I was treated in this, I know I still love my family and will be there for them. I just need them to understand the pain I'm feeling right now, but they are also grieving, so I don't think they can really see things from my eyes right now. I will give it time.", "I sent the following: \"I'm sorry for not attending the funeral. However, there was a lack of miscommunication as I wasn't informed of [grandfather's name]'s passing. In the future, I would appreciate a call about family matters, especially as large as this one. Right now, I am getting many calls, but I hope you all can respect my desire to grieve alone for now as I was not able to see him one last time.\"", "Honestly, I don't think I would have been able to go either way because I wouldn't be able to afford the travel costs right now. But, if I had a bit more time, im sure I could have been able to figure it out, even if it meant I needed to pay back a family member.", "Honestly, this is the type of thinking thar helps me right now. I really do hope it wasn't intentional, and I don't really have any reason to believe it was. The frustrating part comes more from how it's being handled after everything was said and done. I know we are all grieving, so I just need to give it some time before the rest of my family is going to be able to see things from my eyes.", "You are a kind and generous soul and I hope your family appreciates what a class act you are. I\u2019m so very sorry for your loss.", "I'm unfamiliar with Texoma, I just know the funeral was held in Oklahoma where he had lived, but I'd have to see where exactly. I remember the town was small enough you could see end to end by standing in the middle of the main street.", "From a stranger on the internet - I'm so sorry for your loss. It's genuinely impressive how mature and composed your response is, despite the hurt caused by their actions.", "Hold the fuck up, OP.\nDo not accept the \"family\" excuse.\n\nWhat they did was exclude you, intentionally.\n\nYour mom didn't think to mention to their child about the death of their grandpa?\n\nEspecially if you were close?\n\nWhatever happened to a phone call? This posting to Facebook and expected notice is so much bullshit.\n\nMy sincere condolences, OP, but take time to grieve and think about what family really should mean.\n\nIt shouldn't be social media's responsibility.", "Thank you very much", "I agree it shouldn't be social media's responsibility. But I also don't think it was intentional. It was my mother's dad, and I can only imagine how torn up she would have been about it. It hurts a ton, but I can't allow myself to hold it against my family when we are trying to grieve. In time, I hope they will be able to see things from my eyes as well and understand the pain I'm currently going through, but only time can tell for that one."]}
