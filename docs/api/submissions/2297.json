You do not touch another person's baby.", "Nta, should have punched them though", "NTA and anyone who uses their age to demand respect is the Asshole. You know your baby and their health risks.

Well everyone use to abuse their wife, daughters, sisters etc too but now that is a massive no! \n\nIn my opinion touching a baby is the same a touching another without their consent.

If not, then you mind yourself. \n\nAnd I get that the older generation had babies and they survived and what not, but a lot of their advice is outdated and somewhat outright dangerous. Don\u2019t forget they used to have bumpers on cots. Smoking during pregnancy was encouraged. My dads partner tried to tell me to get my newborn to sleep on her belly to get her to sleep through the night. It can be so dangerous. Times have moved on and childcare has improved. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, if the woman wasn\u2019t listening and almost sticking her fingers in the sick baby\u2019s mouth, it doesn\u2019t matter if she shouted at someone in front of her 3yo.

Of course she did!! The stranger didn't listen the first TWO times she was told not to touch the baby. \n\nWhat she taught her 3 year old was it's OK to not let people touch you.
