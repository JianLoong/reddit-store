You do not touch another person's baby.", "Nta, should have punched them though", "NTA and anyone who uses their age to demand respect is the Asshole. You know your baby and their health risks.

They don't need to know your child's medical history to respect your wishes.", "NTA, its really annoying when people do this, then not listening to you and trying to touch the baby again was a really disrespectful move. You could have maybe tried to move away from them and explain the situation with the baby's poor immunity, but older people really do need to learn to look and not touch regardless.", "NTA\n\nEven before the pandemic and everything I don't get why people would feel it is ok to touch someone's child without permission.

Well everyone use to abuse their wife, daughters, sisters etc too but now that is a massive no! \n\nIn my opinion touching a baby is the same a touching another without their consent.

We had to go to every friend's and relative's home if they were infected, so we could \"get it over with\" as my mom put it. \n\nFinally my brother caught it in college at age 20, came home and infected me at age 18.
