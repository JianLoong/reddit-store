You do not touch another person's baby.", "Nta, should have punched them though", "NTA and anyone who uses their age to demand respect is the Asshole. You know your baby and their health risks.

Well everyone use to abuse their wife, daughters, sisters etc too but now that is a massive no! \n\nIn my opinion touching a baby is the same a touching another without their consent.

Before a pandemic, before media saturation made us afraid of others.\n\nLol this is such horse puckey. People behaving like entitled assholes about pregnancy/babies has always been a problem. And no amount of social trust makes it hygienic for a stranger to wipe their germy hand across someone else's face. \n\nOP is NTA for standing up for herself and her child. \nNTA", "I think/hope I taught my 3 year old that no-one has automatic touching rights if he doesn't want it. He may be 3 but I'll always ask if he wants a cuddle so he knows he can say no if he doesn't. (I'll always give a cuddle if he approaches me and asks). If he says no (he's non-verbal so using bsl) then I respect that & always tell him it's okay to say no if you don't want it.", "OP isn\u2019t the AH at all. And as sad as it is, we need to be afraid, especially when these people aren\u2019t listening and respecting the parents boundaries. If a parent invites you to hold the baby or asks you for advice, then great. If not, then you mind yourself. \n\nAnd I get that the older generation had babies and they survived and what not, but a lot of their advice is outdated and somewhat outright dangerous. Don\u2019t forget they used to have bumpers on cots. Smoking during pregnancy was encouraged. My dads partner tried to tell me to get my newborn to sleep on her belly to get her to sleep through the night. It can be so dangerous. Times have moved on and childcare has improved. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, if the woman wasn\u2019t listening and almost sticking her fingers in the sick baby\u2019s mouth, it doesn\u2019t matter if she shouted at someone in front of her 3yo. She\u2019s not an AH for advocating for her baby.", "And when was this? Back when Scarlet Fever left kids blind? When polio closed swimming pools? \nIf someone doesn\u2019t listen when no means no, then yelling is absolutely the right answer", "that they have to keep their boundaries and they don\u2019t have to let anyone touch them. that others should respect when they say no. it\u2019s not about appreciating some UNWANTED advice, if I AKA you not to touch me or my child, you don\u2019t do it bc why the heck would you do that? and yes, yelling is completely okay when you were respectful enough but the other was not.\n\nabsolutely NTA, these people need an effin reality check", "Are you perhaps the stranger? Because it's definitely not okay to touch other people's children when asked not to do so. And if they don't listen and proceed to touch anyway then it's just disgusting. Touching other people's belly or children is just creepy. And people also didn't trust strangers who touched their child before the pandemic.\nAnd the lesson taught to the 3 yo is that no means no\n\nOP is NTA. But you, YTA", "Yeah, that was when pregnant people were seen as public property and breeding machines. You just don't touch people you don't know. That is so gross and creepy.\n\nOP taught her 3-year-old that he has a right to his boundaries and that those have to be respected.", "And women couldn\u2019t vote and marital rape was also an unprosecutable crime. Just because it\u2019s always been a certain way doesn\u2019t make it ok. \n\n\nAnd unwanted touching is assault. Period. IMO, OP could have cold clocked this person and been 100% in the right and defending her baby.\n\nNTA.", "It also used to be normal to smoke in restaurants.. \n\nIt used to be normal to drive without cars eats and seat belts.. \n\nI don't think it was ever really normal to touch pregnant people simply because they were growing a child. It was more likely that they were taught to \"respect\" their elders, and that it was rude to say something in the situation.  \n\nMedia saturation didn't make us afraid of others.. terrible PEOPLE made us afraid of others.  \n\nOP didn't need to yell??? Of course she did!! The stranger didn't listen the first TWO times she was told not to touch the baby. \n\nWhat she taught her 3 year old was it's OK to not let people touch you. It's ok to yell and make a huge scene if some person you don't know is trying to touch you. Both very good life lessons", "She said No. The stranger should learn that don't touch means that you are NOT allowed to do that", ">It used to be normal to touch babies and the pregnant mom's tummy. That was before\n\nFound the boomer from the story.", "You never heard of polio? Were you raised in a bubble? Tuberculosis, measles, German measles, scarlet fever, chicken pox, diphtheria, malaria.. Oh MY!", "Ah yes for the first 6 weeks?\n\nNewborns don\u2019t have any immunity. If people have any issue they don\u2019t need to visit.\nI\u2019m not forcing anyone.\n\nWhat\u2019s funny?", "My OB told me to make sure everyone who would be around my newborn got an updated whooping cough vaccine. That was almost 18 years ago. I was told the same thing with my 12 year old. The whooping cough vaccine doesn't last forever and whooping cough kills babies.", "Absolutely.", "Yep. That\u2019s what OB doctors have been recommending and stressing to their pregnant patients for years! Updated shot for mom and dad and anyone who wants to visit the baby.", "If you want to be a real asshole (and I would be) just start screaming asking why they\u2019re trying to take your baby. People need to be shamed out of this. Someone tried touching my daughter as a newborn during flu season on the rare times I would take her out of the house and that\u2019s what I said and it worked like a charm. They scurried away quickly", "That's true enough but I probably wouldn't even want friends or family touching my kids without washing their hands or sanitizing first.", ">ut her child's medical background? Mom said no and that's all the explanation a stranger needs. If a random person can't touch a child without permission, they're certainly not entitled to sensitive\n\nShe shouldn't that's why she isn't the AH, it just clears up an awkward situation a lot quicker for everyone. Op clearly worries they did something wrong hence the post. Having a lowered immune system isn't really sensitive medical info its very common in baby's, even though I do understand some people wouldn't want to discus it, its just an option.", "Wow. How did you jump from patting a baby's cheek to sexual assault. That was quite the gymnastics. \nFYI: As I already stated, I did teach my children that they did not have to let anyone touch them, ever, no matter who it was. And I calmly told people to not touch my sensitive one. Calmly. No yelling necessary.", "I had one child who did not like to be touched. He had beautiful dark, almost black hair and blue eyes. Women always wanted to touch his hair. I would tell them he didn't like it. I did not yell at anyone. I taught them their body was their own by calmly using my words. No yelling necessary.", "You are going to sit there and tell me that my world did not exist???? WOW \nI didn't say she can't tell people to not touch her kid. I said she doesn't need to YELL.", "Sexual assault is unwanted touching. Touching someone's child after you were been told three times by the parent that you were not allowed to do so, what do you think that is? It might not be sexual, but it's not OK just because you're an old fart, who grew up in a different day and age, where that kind of wildly inappropriate behavior was tolerated.", "And OP stated calmly once not to touch her baby, and the woman ignored her not once, but twice.\n\nWhen your calm \"no\" is ignored, you are within your rights to raise your voice and draw attention from others. It's a matter of safety by drawing attention to the violation of your (or your child's) personal space and bodily autonomy.", "I'm going to tell you that you're looking back on the past with rose colored glasses, yes. And evidently she did need to yell if this grabby stranger kept trying to touch the child even after being firmly told NO."]}
