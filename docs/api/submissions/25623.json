At first I did not think anything as I am secured in my look, and I think anyone will compliment the one they know, BUT another bridesmaid sent me the original pics, and I realized N photoshopped herself. Then I thought how weird of her to seek online validation for being prettier than the bride, through edited pics. Then I remebered some of her other actions and they give me the creeps.\n\n- Before the wedding I told my bridesmaids to wear green, but they dont have to wear matching traditional bridesmaids dresses as I wanted them to have dresses that are beautiful to them. As we were looking through options, I suggested N could wear a dress that has a front slit or with glitters, and she said \"oh no I will over shadow the bride\". I laughed and said thats just a weird thought, noone can overshadow a bride, and if they try they will just embarass themselves. N then said she'll wear 2-3 different dresses and will change during the day, I didnt mind but then she said, \"oh no I will over step the bride). I just told her to decide whatever. \n\n- A year ago, N volunteered to do my wedding HAIR. She did a great hairdo for me few months ago in a friendship photoshoot we had with another friend. She spent 15-30 mins on her makeup and is always proud of how minimal her makeup style is, and the rest of the time 1 hour or so she was doing my hair. But later she pointed out that the photographer was only complimenting me as beautiful, and I have so many beautiful pictures.\n\n- On my wedding, my photographer was to start shooting at 7:00am. I woke up at 3:30am to do my makeup (I am skilled so no issues). N woke up around 5:00, did her makeup for more than 1,5 hours. I didnt want to rush her to do my hair as thats a \"favor\" she is not paid to do. At 6:45 N ran over and did my hair in 15-20 mins or so. After receiving the pics I realized the hair was messy and broken due to lack of brushing. But l I didnt feel so well that day so I dont attribute any flaw in my look to her, I just blame my stress.\n\n- After the wedding N told me she was emotional at the ceremony she wanted to cry, but saw noone crying so she stopped herself bc she did not want my husbands fam to think she is his ex lover, plotting to steal the groom (serious, no joke) This is so bizarre smh like she's calling herself or some of her fantasies out. \n\n- Before the wedding N told my husband she heard he wanted to learn Ballet, then suggested him to join her in ballet classes (not weird lk, but together with her above claim, it became weird).\n\nI'll let you be the judge.

Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n > 1. The action that I might take is to confront my long time friend and bridesmaids about why she edited herself in the pictures and posted them online in an attempt to solidify her \"beauty\" over the me (the bride) on my wedding day. And to mention that she made me uncomfortable by her comments on worry my husband's family would think she is his ex lover, and for asking him to go to do ballet with her. \n2. Some might say she is not doing well mentally to display such behavior, and confronting her is not kind as a friend. Or people might think these are little things that dont deserve a confrontation. Or some people might say she is a long time friend who was a bridesmaid and helped me in my wedding so I would be ungrateful to hold this small thing against her. So many possibilities and Im a people pleaser so it doest help that I constantly make excuses for people and confuse myself. So I want people to give their opinions here hopefully I can have an objective view.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
