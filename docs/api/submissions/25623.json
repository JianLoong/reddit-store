At first I did not think anything as I am secured in my look, and I think anyone will compliment the person they know, BUT another bridesmaid sent me the original pics, and I realized N photoshopped herself. Then I thought how weird of her to seek online validation for being prettier than the bride, through edited pics. Then I remebered some of her other actions and they give me the creeps.\n\n- Before the wedding I told my bridesmaids to wear green, but they dont have to wear matching traditional bridesmaids dresses as I wanted them to have dresses that are beautiful to them. As we were looking through options, I suggested N could wear a dress that has a front slit or with glitters, and she said \"oh no I will over shadow the bride\". I laughed and said thats just a weird thought, noone can overshadow a bride, and if they try they will just embarass themselves. N then said she'll wear 2-3 different dresses and will change during the day, I didnt mind but then she said, \"oh no I will over step the bride). I just told her to decide whatever. \n\n- A year ago, N volunteered to do my wedding HAIR. She did a great hairdo for me few months ago in a friendship photoshoot we had with another friend. She spent 15-30 mins on her makeup and is always proud of how minimal her makeup style is, and the rest of the time 1 hour or so she was doing my hair. But later she pointed out that the photographer was only complimenting me as beautiful, and I have so many beautiful pictures.\n\n- On my wedding, my photographer was to start shooting at 7:00am. I woke up at 3:30am to do my makeup (I am skilled so no issues). N woke up around 5:00, did her makeup for more than 1,5 hours. I didnt want to rush her to do my hair as thats a \"favor\" she is not paid to do. At 6:45 N ran over and did my hair in 15-20 mins or so. After receiving the pics I realized the hair was messy and broken due to lack of brushing. But l I didnt feel so well that day so I dont attribute any flaw in my look to her, I just blame my stress.\n\n- After the wedding N told me she was emotional at the ceremony she wanted to cry, but saw noone crying so she stopped herself bc she did not want my husbands fam to think she is his ex lover, plotting to steal the groom (serious, no joke) This is so bizarre smh like she's calling herself or some of her fantasies out. \n\n- Before the wedding N told my husband she heard he wanted to learn Ballet, then suggested him to join her in ballet classes (not weird lk, but together with her above claim, it became weird).\n\nI'll let you be the judge. I am just totally creeped out, and not sure how to continue in this friendship.\n\n[ADDED] in a way I do feel bad because besides the above points, she did help me alot throughout the wedding day (filming behind the scenes footages, carrying my stuff even when her feet bled due to uncomfortable shoes, fixing my hair during the day, fixing and fluffing my dress to make sure I have nice overall shots), and after all she travelled all the way from Germany to Czech Republic to be my bridesmaid and she has been friends with me for more than 10 years (although long distance for the majority of time).. Im just so puzzled as to why she would then go out of her way to behave like this around my wedding and wedding pictures. I do feel like if I want to continue a true friendship I should be honest and discuss what bothers me with her rather than just keep it to myself and have negative feelings or pity towards her, but are these too small to even bring up?", "created_utc": 1693136982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162oc6d/aitah_if_i_will_confront_my_long_time_friend_for/", "score": 335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The action that I might take is to confront my long time friend and bridesmaids about why she edited herself in the pictures and posted them online in an attempt to solidify her \"beauty\" over the me (the bride) on my wedding day. And to mention that she made me uncomfortable by her comments on worry my husband's family would think she is his ex lover, and for asking him to go to do ballet with her. \n2. Some might say she is not doing well mentally to display such behavior, and confronting her is not kind as a friend. Or people might think these are little things that dont deserve a confrontation. Or some people might say she is a long time friend who was a bridesmaid and helped me in my wedding so I would be ungrateful to hold this small thing against her. So many possibilities and Im a people pleaser so it doest help that I constantly make excuses for people and confuse myself.

I put alot of effort this year to take care of my health and my body as I was to be a bride and I do recognize the security in having good appearance.

Maybe she's great for a shopping trip or a all-inclusive Mexican vacay but not a site-seeing trip to Europe.\n\nMaybe she totally sucks as a friend all together. \n\nBut that's for you to decide, you just shouldn't expect/ask her to change.   :(\n\nI dunno - maybe she's a great shopper!", "Unfortunately no.

In this scenario, it's clear that you have several valid concerns and emotions about your friend's behavior around your wedding. While you're understandably puzzled and creeped out by her actions, it's important to approach this situation with a thoughtful and empathetic mindset.\n\nGiven that she did help you a lot throughout the wedding day and has been a long-time friend, it's a good idea to have an open and honest conversation with her. Choose a suitable time and place to discuss your feelings without being confrontational. Focus on expressing your concerns and observations rather than placing blame. Share your feelings about her posts, her comments, and her behavior leading up to and during the wedding. Explain that these actions made you uncomfortable and unsure about the friendship.\n\nA business-minded approach would involve seeking understanding, rather than immediately cutting ties. It's possible that there are underlying reasons for her behavior that you're not aware of. By having a direct and honest conversation, you give her the opportunity to explain herself, apologize if necessary, and potentially clear up any misunderstandings.\n\nRemember that communication is key, and addressing these concerns openly can lead to a healthier and more transparent friendship. If, after the conversation, you still feel uncomfortable and believe that the friendship might not be beneficial for both parties, you can make a more informed decision about how to proceed. Just like in business, addressing concerns directly and professionally can lead to positive outcomes, even in personal relationships.", "My advice , you have a lovely husband and new married life to look forward to. Leave this situation as it sounds like its getting toxic.

It is my own issue to overcome as it has caused me alot of issue not only in everyday life but also at work.", "And that\u2019s really the red flag. In behavior, she seems to do some nice things to balance out the bad things, but I wouldn\u2019t doubt it if she fantasizes about some really crazy shit.

She definitely has some insecurity or something and this is how it is presenting.", "So? Block her.", "Actually I got up at 3:30. She got up at around 5:00", ">she's been chasing me on SM asking if Im ok, I guess seeing how I do not talk to her currently. Meanwhile Im too terrified and confused to even speak to her and I really do not know what to make of it all.\n\nShe's fishing for a response. She threw out a boatload of bait to try and goad you into reacting but you didn't bite so now she's trying to nudge you onto the hook. She wants you to be angry and make accusations so she can present as shocked and victimised that you would say such unkind things. She wants to present herself as the gracious, bigger person and present you as an insecure and ungrateful friend who is lashing out at Princess Wonderful after she did so much for you because you're jealous that she was prettier than you at your wedding.\n\nShe's trying to set up a narrative here to build herself up and tear you down, but she needs you to play your part in this and you're not reacting. Be cautiously wary during your party because she liable to keep escalating out of a desperate need to elicit a response from you. Your best play here is to be polite, be courteous, do not be provoked and just play oblivious. Then after the party, distance yourself from her. This woman isn't your friend. She's a social predator trying to feed off you. Don't let her and grey rock her instead.", "I do feel indebted to her energy and time spent on my wedding and my self as a friend. It is my crippling people pleaser tendency.", "And today I learn something new :) it sounds like the covert type is almost impossible to identify. Which makes it that much more terrifying. Im sorry I keep repeating that Im creeped out and terrified, but its because as an adult with not so many friends I do hold my friends very close to me and to find out that they are potentially sick is scary.", "NTA\n\nYou have it right. You can\u2019t overshadow the bride on her wedding day", "NTA. Just slowly phase her out of your life", "N would take this to social media in a heartbeat if OP tries to talk to her. I'd just quietly stop making contact. YWNBTA", "You're a nicer person than me lol!", "Both can be because she wanted to be a part of The Big Day. One was a good reason, but it didn't feel like enough to her, so she kept going...unfortunately.", "> sounds like the covert type is almost impossible to identify.\n\nnope I have one friend and one ex-bf\n\nbecause they complain about pathetic things a lot of people would maybe be too ashamed to complain about?\nbut also they expect you to REALLY CARE about a bunch of shit you don't care about?\nand they are always complaining about how hard their lives are and aren't you listening and their life is so hard and my ex wife is so mean despite me making her life miserable... wahhhh I'm so sad the people I was mean to won't talk to me\n\nthey are almost the easiest to identify actually because they are the lamest", "ETA, she def sounds jealous but not like crazy jealous m. But, she is most def not a real friend to you. I think your just over her and you want to make her actions seem more sinister so when you cut her out you won\u2019t feel so guilty. Especially since you said that she also helped you a lot as well. I would just distance myself from her and slowly let the friendship die out. No need to make it awkward or something.", "I would post the untouched photos, then go to HER photos and comment: \"The photoshopping you did, friend, is so flattering! So sorry I did not have time to do the same on the photos I posted, as it makes such a huge difference in yours! Well done!\" But I am REALLY petty and kinda passive aggressive."]}
