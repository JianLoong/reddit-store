Then I took them in and gave them a bath, and got the sap off with a bit of hand sanitizer before dressing them and putting them to bed. \n\nI then came out and tried to explain to her that it wasn't soap that could be scrubbed onto someone like that, but instead, she got mad and yelled at me for yelling at her, and she went to bed early, which isn't a good sign.

Are there different kinds of Fast Orange? Because it isn't that rough and it isn't acid. Who was yelling? Your wife? Or the kids? \n\nUnless she was hitting them, the short version is that you yelled at your wife in front of your kids over her parenting. Parents are supposed to present a united front, otherwise kids will start seeing one parent as a villain and the other as the pushover. If there have been multiple instances similar to this, it isn't just about the Fast Orange and I hope both of you will agree to counseling.

But NTA, that shit can hurt when it's gets rubbed on hard to your skin, especially softer skin like the chest as you pointed out she was doing. Yelling is never appropriate, but sometimes it has to happen if no one is listening and she was hurting the kids. I remember my mom scrubbing me when I was young and covered in muck and it was never gentle. I can only assume the same here, rough cleaning agent with rough hands makes for a painful time.", "YTA\n\nI use that stuff literally all the time for my arms and legs etc in the shower when I'm done with a really involved job like pulling an engine, and even my incredibly sensitive skin never reacts to it.

You're the asshole.  Abrasive soaps may not be great on a daily basis for kids.  But a one time use for something a little more serious than dirt isn't gonna be a serious risk and you know it.

You might not rub skin off but can leave a nasty rash. It obviously wasn't comfortable for the kids.", "Gonna go against the grain here\u2026. You could have handled your reaction better with your wife but I really do understand the reason why you yelled. It was as AH move but for good reasons. My mother used it on me when I was dirty with sap from climbing trees and the had to move in to harder chemicals. My skin was tore up because of the abrasiveness the to have something else used was torture. Rubbing it in to the point the skin is reddened is not good either way.

I grew up working in my grandfather's shop with him. It was a normal thing for me to be covered in oil and grease every day of the summer when I was a kid. Guess how we got it off?

I use that soap and yeah I wouldn\u2019t put it on my kids, and it wasn\u2019t a good solution so I get why the reaction. But I bet she feels belittled and stupid and humiliated.

Apologize to her and the kids", "Unless what your wife was doing was actually abusive, YTA.\n\nFirst - if this was not just \"my wife was ineffectively trying to clean the kids and they didn't like it\" and more like \"my wife was intentionally physically hurting the kids\" you do need to take a serious look at whether this is child abuse, and get your kids away if that's the case.\n\nBut if this was just that the kids didn't like it and it wasn't working to clean them, your approach doesn't seem respectful of your wife. You could have come in and said \"hey wife, I think I have an idea that might be a little easier. Can I help?\"  Instead, you yelled at her and forced your way into control. This actually sounds a lot like her behavior toward the kids. You might all benefit from more compassion, patience, and communication.", "When I worked as a CNC BRAKE operator making parts for agriculture equipment, I had a pump bottle of gojo in the shower to get the layer of dirt off every day.  \n\nIt's soap with abrasive, it's not going to hurt anyone.", "NTA - my dad has always had that stuff around and warned me against using it unless I really had to when i was young.

I'd freak out and scream too!\n\nOn the screaming. Id bet if OP walked in the garage and didn't yell no one would have heard him over the commotion from the mild torture the children were being put through.\n\nWife is TA. He gave a good, legitimate solution to the problem and she chose to use pain. She was punishing the children for making a mess in sap. Sounds like my own mom. If there's no pain there's no lesson. Bet the kids won't play in the sap again, especially if just mom is home.", "It works great on sap. Teach 'em a lesson.", "NTA, why was we she using that soap??? Makes no sense.", "ESH.  It sounds like you overruled her on letting them play, then failed to clean them up timely afterwards.  I'm guessing she got frustrated - perhaps it's far from the first time she's had to clean up a mess caused (indirectly) by you,  and left far too long?  Or perhaps the kids came in and got sap everywhere before you could clean them?  It's pretty clear she was frustrated.  I've used that soap,  even on more sensitive areas.  It isn't by itself that bad.  \n\nBut it sounds like she may have been unnecessarily harsh while scrubbing them,  perhaps out of frustration.  She should have been gentler about it,  should have tagged you in when she got frustrated and angry,  should not have scrubbed her anger out, which again,  I'm guessing she has done before, given your kids calmed down when you did take over.  \n\nIn short,  her tools were not inappropriate,  but if I'm reading this right,  her technique left a lot to be desired, and it's possible she was being harsh to punish you and the kids.  That is not appropriate.   But you kind of created that whole situation,  and should have been a lot more on top of cleaning it up.", "Gonna go ESH. You could have communicated the dangers in a better way than yelling at your partner.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have been using that product in such a way but has a right to be upset at being yelled at. Chill out dude, learn to communicate urgency better", "NTA. They are yours too.", "NTA, if she didn't understand how abrasive that is then she shouldn't have used it! That can take the skin off a man's hands who has full on callouses from years of work! Using it on your very young children should absolutely be considered abusive!", "ESH. And I copy paste my comment in another chain here for you. In case you are still thinking you are cool and alright after you \"apologize\".\n\nSummary: **you did not apologize shit, do it properly.**\n\nFor your information: Screaming bloody at someone then \"Hey I am sorry, get over it\" just make you more of an asshole. You did not apologize, you just explained your wife \"I am right, you are wrong, I am not sorry\". You have no remorse as I saw what you commented in this sub. You continue to make excuse \"It is just a knee-jerk reaction\" (like that makes you ok and cool in the first place). Do you need us to teach you how to apologize? Here:\n\nStep 1. Realize WHAT you did wrong, WHY you did wrong, HOW you did wrong, and put it first on the table, absolutely no \"but\", no \"my side of the story is\", and no EXCUSE. Say you did wrong, WHAT, WHY, HOW.\n\nStep 2. Apologize. \"I am sincerely sorry for my actions.\" And again, absolutely no \"but\", no \"my side of the story is\", and no EXCUSE. \"I AM SORRY.\" END OF SENTENCE. I am making it clear enough?\n\nStep 3. Put out a plan to show that you are remorse of what you did and fix it in the present and future. *\"I have anger problem, I will \\[do this do that, go therapy, for f sake\\]. I will not freak out on you. Ever. Again. I promise. And if I can't then I break my promise, and I am less of a human I can be, and the next plan will be \\[do this do that\\].\"* And it has to be accepted by your wife's term. NOT YOU.\n\nStep 4. Follow through, to the end, as the human you are.\n\nWhatever she accept your apology or not, then you guys can talk and communicate about the event. What you did wrong, what she did wrong, no blaming, no talk over.", "NTA", "NTA you said you would clean them and you did. She was being rude to them", "NTA I\u2019ve used the stuff and it can absolutely rough up sensitive skin. If your wife was being harsh she would have been hurting them. You explained you yelled \u2018stop doing that\u201d which is reactive and to get attention.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't wait for you to do what you said you were going to do. She just got mad and took out her stress on the kids.", "She was hurting the kids by scrubbing them too hard with a soap that isn't meant to be used that way. She needed to stop.

Therapy, both couples and individual for you, can help. \n\nAnd you need to find some opportunities for your wife to be loved and respected as a parent -- by you, the kids, and herself. The behaviors you describe sound like what happens when someone feels insecure about something important -- a feeling that must be really common among working moms who delegate most parenting to a stay-at-home dad but still face constant societal expectations of being the nurturer. Unfortunately, if she's just not feeling enough parenting wins, your sweeping in to take over a situation (and gloat about your superior knowledge of cleansing products!) just makes her feel even worse. She might have even purposely tried to intercept the kids rather than waiting for you to handle it *because* she desperately wanted to prove she can handle a situation like this without your help.
