Kitkat is a huge brand for them, one no buyer would get since they would lose the rights as soon as the sale went through.\n\nMaybe if I ever do have reason to travel to the US I will try some chocolate from a small shop", "> It\u2019s rude to complain about a gift that you don\u2019t like,\n\nThis isn't a gift! You don't go to strangers' houses and knock on their door demanding gifts!!! This isn't about a personal connection that the giver of candy has to the trick or treater. This isn't a christmas or birthday present. \n\n>something you knew they wouldn\u2019t like\n\nI don't think that's something OP knows. I think that's something you're insisting on because it's something *you* don't like.", "> If you're purposely buying candy no kid likes for Halloween\n\nOP was just purposefully buying a pile of candy. He bought a shitload of candy of many varieties. If you feel the need to vandalize his house because of that, do you really need me to tell you who the asshole is?", "Brown sugar fudge?!?! What is this amazingness you speak of lolol?? It sounds freaking delicious.", "\ud83d\ude01", "And transportation--I'm in southeastern Michigan...", "I was going to say the same thing. Save some for me!! ;)", "Okay, *you* are the winner.", "Oh absolutely the kids will not want them. There's such a small G&P demographic. I'm a freak because I live circus peanuts, candy corn, G&P, just about every candy people hate on.", "My siblings and I loved almond joys and mounds", "That\u2019s kinda the whole point of Halloween. Candy. Good candy. Not obscure great grandma candy that almost nobody likes.", "I don\u2019t know how someone could go their whole life living in society and interacting with other people only to not know that most kids don\u2019t want licorice. But that\u2019s besides the point. You are making this out to be more high stakes than it actually is. Nobody is genuinely mad at OP for this, they\u2019re just joking. It\u2019s just that his wife wanted kids to be excited for their house, and now only a few will be (the licorice-loving minority). He\u2019s \u201cTA\u201d in very light terms.\n\nAnd idk why you\u2019re acting like trick-or-treaters knock on doors and demand candy at gunpoint; people turn on their porch lights with the expectation that they\u2019re going to give out candy. It is a gift. It\u2019s not like leaving your old couch on the curb for anyone to take because you don\u2019t need it anymore. There\u2019s literally no point in giving stuff to the kids on Halloween if they\u2019re not going to like it. I don\u2019t know about you, but growing up I never saw dark houses covered in eggs and TP like they were in the movies, so there\u2019s no reason to give out candy if you don\u2019t want to make the kids happy", "Omg it is. It's pretty easy to make, too.\nhttps://www.eaglebrand.ca/En/Recipes/Brown-Sugar-Fudge", "Penuche", "I love Candy Corn, so we can bond over the pure fall sugary goodness there.", "Let us rejoice, coconut friend", "> Good candy.\n\nCandy corn is a candy *only eaten* around halloween and nobody fucking likes it. So na, I disagree that the whole point of halloween is good candy. The point of halloween is candy in excess, which he's ready to provide.", "> You are making this out to be more high stakes than it actually is.\n\nI'm not the one calling people names. \n\n>Nobody is genuinely mad at OP for this,\n\nHe literally says in the post his wife called him an asshole.\n\n>He\u2019s \u201cTA\u201d in very light terms.\n\nI just don't think it's fair or reasonable to call him an asshole at all. He's not. He's giving out a bunch of candy to whoever wants, and a small portion of it is something that perhaps not everyone will love. That's it, end of story. \n\n>idk why you\u2019re acting like trick-or-treaters knock on doors and demand candy at gunpoint\n\nThey literally go to strangers' houses and knock and the door and ask for candy. \n\n> It is a gift. It\u2019s not like leaving your old couch on the curb\n\nNo, it's like having a parade and throwing stale bazooka joe or dubble bubble at the kids. It's not a gift, it's just a fun thing to give away to anyone who wants. \n\n>There\u2019s literally no point in giving stuff to the kids on Halloween if they\u2019re not going to like it.\n\n90% of the candy he bought was other shit. \n\n>there\u2019s no reason to give out candy if you don\u2019t want to make the kids happy\n\nI would say that there's definitely no reason to give out candy if your wife is going to call you names over it. Next year she can get the candy and give it out, I sure as shit would never participate after that.", "No one is telling him to buy 100s of each type to cater to every taste? Hyperbole or not that\u2019s just literally not the point. Just don\u2019t get mostly candy that 10% of people will like and 90% will dislike.", "Oh. My. God. Thank you for this!!!! I am so getting the ingredients for it this weekend!!!", "The autumn mix, with the pumpkins!", "*grabbing your hands and dancing in a circle slo/mo* \u263a\ufe0f", "I mean I know that\u2019s your opinion but I think you\u2019ve established by now that you don\u2019t really \u201cget\u201d Halloween."]}
