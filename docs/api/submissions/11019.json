I got called in on a Saturday (I\u2019m off weekends and the daycares closed weekends) and I pleaded with my sister to watch my son.  She refused, and told me it was her weekend off from school and she had a lot of studying to do. I told her I really needed her to do this for me, I never ask her. She told me I should just find a sitter online. I told her no, you need to watch him, I take care of you and you can do this one thing for me, or you can go back and live with our parents.\n\nShe got really upset and said I\u2019m throwing what i do for her in her face, and how she\u2019s an adult and my son wasn\u2019t her kid. She did agree though and I went to work. While I was on break I checked my phone and had numerous text from my parents saying I was abusing my power over my sister, and that my son wasn\u2019t her responsibility. \n\nI never ever ask my sister for help with the baby.

Your working is what is allowing her to live rent free, and have nothing to worry about. Hell, you are supporting her.\n\nIf your sister didn't live with you, your financial situation would be a little better as you would not be supporting another adult as well. Everyone saying that you are taking advantage of her, look at it this way. Sister can go live on campus, pay room and board, and support herself. Then OP may not have to work additional hours.\n\nOPs sister is the entitled one as are the parents. I'd advise my sister to start looking for new housing and ways to support herself. Stop using being in college as an excuse to freeload. Many people go to college full-time and are able to support themselves. I had ZERO assistance while in college and had to balance school and work. To not have to worry about anything other than school in exchange for occasionally watching my niece/nephew/sister would have been a blessing.", "NTA  \napparently a lot of people in this thread think a one time babysitting day is worse than being kicked out and either having massive debt or a part time job.", "Your sister needs to go. Or stop leeching you off and support you in cash or kind. Where are your parents in all this mess? Why are you supporting her since school when you have your parents? Your sister is ungrateful. She needs to leave. \nOn the flip side think about this. Your son is very young. Someone aged 18 with no motivation to babysit or help you out would then out to be horrible sitters.", "NTA you're supporting her. She's living there for free. Your work called you in when your daycare was closed. You'd think she'd have more concern that you keep your job considering it's literally keeping a roof over her head and food in her belly. I did my whole undergrad raising 2 children and I did a BS in molecular and cellular biology, so you can't tell me she couldn't handle watching your baby while she studied. She just didn't want to. She needs to step up and start contributing and be more appreciative of what you're doing for her... before she finds her ass out on the curb.", "NTA.\n\nIt was an emergency and you couldn't get a sitter in time. I can't imagine living with a family rent free and saying no to doing one favor.", "Nta and frankly reddits army of people who -at least in theory- would always have a plan in place always keep their calm and explain in well situated words every little mondane thing annoys me. It's not to much to ask. If she does not want to help you, you should absolutely stop helping her.

Your sister has absolutely zero obligation to watch your kid, and threatening her with her literal housing to make her do what you want is absolutely an abuse of power. Your kid is always your responsibility, and it's on you to either find a babysitter, tell your boss you can't come in on such short notice due to lack of childcare options, or bring your baby into the office if possible and your boss insists on having you there. \n\nThat said, I would think that your sister could help out when needed, within reason. We don't know, and maybe you don't either, how much homework/studying your sister needed to get done. She has her own obligations. But unless I had a midterm or major project that I needed to do, I would feel pretty crummy refusing to babysit for someone doing so much for me. \n\n\nFinal note: considering the way you extorted her into babysitting, I would be surprised if she did more than the absolute bare minimum watching your kid.", "I don\u2019t get why people are voting YTA. OP\u2019s sister is living with her for *free* and refuses to do a *one-time* favor. That\u2019s the height of selfishness and entitlement. OP is being taken advantage of for free rent, because the sister clearly lacks family feeling. I would tell the sister to leave, because she\u2019s an adult and old enough to take care of herself.

It would be different if the agreement was, \u201cyou can live with me rent free and not worry about anything, as long as you watch baby should an emergency ever come up,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t sound like that was a discussion that has been had. \n\nYour son is not her responsibility and it sounds like she is trying to be responsible and repay you for helping her through school by studying hard. Kids are one hell of a distraction, as I\u2019m sure you know, and I doubt she got any studying done while you were at work. Did your work force you to go in? I highly doubt it. It would have been just as easy for you to tell them, \u201cI can\u2019t come in because I don\u2019t have a sitter,\u201d as it would have been for your sister to agree to watching your son.", "YTA. Taking care of the kid wasn't not a part of the agreement. That's your kid, not hers. Kick her out, and don't be mad when she resents you or doesn't talk to you.

It's one thing to say \"you can live with me for free for the convenience of school but on occasion I may need you to watch my son\", however it's entirely different if that is not the agreement. You can't unilaterally decide to change the terms (except if you want to kick her out, that's of course you're decision). She is allowed to say she'd rather move out than have to be a babysitter though.", "YTA - this one borders on E S H, it would be nice if your sister helped you out but she is in no way obligated to do so. You don't have to accept the shift, your inability to find child care at short notice should be good enough of a reason.\n\nThe fact that you expected her to drop what she needs to do to help you makes you the AH in the first place, but the fact that you threw everything you are doing for her in her face exacerbates the issue. Threatening to kick her out because she didn't help you ONE time with no notice is the cherry on the (ass)whole cake.\n\nYou need to apologise to her and perhaps discuss going forward that sometimes you may need babysitting services at short notice and that you feel that it is fair because of all you do for her. However, this is a discussion that needs to be had ahead of time, not in the heat of the moment, and definitely not with any threats of eviction.  \n\n\nETA you should also talk to your parents about contributing to her food and/or rent to ease the burden on you, and allow you to pay for a sitter (maybe even her) even at short notice", "NTA \n\nI don't understand these esh verdicts.

You asked her as a one off in an emergency, if she can\u2019t do that for you then she needs to start pulling her weight in terms of rent and groceries.", "NTA. You are taking care of your sister full time, but she can\u2019t take care of your child for one day?

She's the AH for that.", "Unless it had been discussed and agreed to in advance that you may in an emergency need her to baby sit then YTA \n\nYou are an AH for forcing her by threatening her living situation.

It's a sudden emergency and it's a one time thing, I think the sister is a bit entitled with the \"I don't owe you anything\" while basically ignoring the fact you're doing her a favor by letting her live with you and not asking for anything. The baby might not be her child but that's her niece/nephew, not a stranger's baby. \n\nI have a sister with baby too and every event we do together I automatically accept without conditions or prior discussion that I'd watch the child if she suddenly needs me too. If I lived with her rent free, I'd appreciate it if she informed me beforehand but otherwise I'd still watch the baby for her in this situation, provided I had no emergency of my own to deal with.", "YTA.

Who needs drama and family like this!!", "Nta, start charging her rent and utilities. She can start to pay her own way as an adult. Then use said money to hire a babysitter.", "NTA. Helping out the people you love should be a natural thing. You helped out your sister because you love her, and she should have done the same for you. Honestly though, this is a normal stage for a lot of people. When you're 18 you're still likely to be completely self-obsessed and to know nothing about the real world. She has no clue AT ALL what having a job is like, or having kids, or just being an adult. She's not selfish because she doesn't love you, she's selfish because she's stupid and young (hopefully). I honestly think you should start charging her rent, because teens who get a free ride through college can easily fall flat on their face once they graduate and get shoved into the real world. I don't think it's great to kick kids out of the nest at 18, but it's also just as bad to coddle them until they're 22. You know what I bet will happen if you tell her she has to start paying rent? She's going to be mad and indignant and start researching how to get her own apartment, and she's going to learn about rent costs, utilities, etc, and that might be all she needs to see what you are doing for her and to maybe not be quite as selfish going forward. And, even more importantly, if she starts paying rent (or utilities) now, she'll get to be slowly eased into adulthood instead of being dropped into it a few years from now.", "NTA.

That'd be the parents' job not her sister's who is barely six years her senior, pretty much still starting her own life with a baby and a fianc\u00e9 who is deployed. Reimbursing her costs should be the bare minimum on the parents' part.", "Usually I side with the person being forced to babysit for free because hello that's a big ask! But in this case, OP doesn't ask often - it sounds like this was one exception. On top of that, the sister is living with OP for free without any responsibilities in the household rent, upkeep, etc. OP does NOT have to take care of her adult sister, just like the sister doesn't have to take care of OP's kid. But when you're an adult living for free with someone it's just damn good manners to help out once in a while when asked.\n\nI think the sister would have been right to set a boundary like saying \"Okay, sure, I can watch (baby) today but please understand this can't be a regular occurrence because I do have to focus on my studies.\" This way, she's helping the sister in a pinch but also setting the expectation that this cannot be a regular issue.\n\nAnd if the OP doesn't like that answer and wants it to be a regular expectation for the sister to watch her kid, then she needs to also discuss that with the sister. Throwing it in the sisters face that she's living there for free holds no weight if babysitting wasn't something discussed as part of the sisters responsibilities for living there free of rent. It's something that needs to be negotiated on, and either the sister and OP come to an agreement that works for both of them or the sister doesn't live there, easy as that. \n\nFor this reason I'm going to go with NTA, OP - but I'd have an actual conversation with your sister about helping out once in a while, and figure out what you and she can live with. Otherwise, maybe it would be better for her to live somewhere else. Oh but your parents are major AH's for expecting you to take care of your sister without asking for anything in return - I bet they always expected you to take care of her when you two were growing up too.

You may not actually go through with it, but they don't have to know that. The objective is to reset expectations and make everyone aware that there are both benefits and responsibilities to this arrangement. \n\nIf you are busting your butt to support the household and she isn't contributing then that's one thing, but your expectation that she should help when you have a child care crisis despite her having other commitments is going to be dicey and her reaching out to your parents for leverage about how you run your household is definitely a flag on the play. You're an adult and your home is not a satellite of their home. They don't get to automatically get to tell you how to run it. \n\nFrom your post she didn't say she would never watch your son, but the timing was wrong. As a grad school myself student I love my granddaughter but there are legitimately times during my coursework that I have no time. I know other friends and family who are also drowning in coursework. I get that you really needed her but the fact that she is living in your home by doesn't mean she is available when you need her. And I think that rather than take sides your parents should have gotten in the car and drove the 3 hours to support both of you.\n\nMy son and his fiance are going through the exact same thing (yes all of us are in great school at the same time) trying to manage a heavy course load and a toddler and when they get in a jam we load up the cars and drive the 5 hours to pitch in. Sometimes my wife will go, sometimes I will go, sometimes the other grandmother will go. During crisis we rally together but we don't take sides. The primary question isn't whose responsibility it is - but can we help and so flag on the play on your parents. Grandparents and parents have higher responsibility than siblings in my hierarchy. \n\nHaving her find other living arrangements is the cleanest way to check your whole family without a whole bunch of words. They will have to decide which is more convenient, watching your son or commuting the 3 hours to attend college or shelling out money for an apartment. Tell them that you are on a budget and if you have to account for the fact that you're job could call you in and you have to pay for a sitter on occasion then you can't afford to host your sister and then stop talking while everyone pisses their pants.

Occasionally helping out is reasonable when family is financially supporting you like that.  She absolutely does not have to watch the kid but OP absolutely does not have to keep supporting her either and her sister needs to realize that and show a little appreciation.", "OP didn't abuse her power. This was the only time she asked her sister to watch the baby because she had been unexpectedly called into work. If sister moved back in with her parents, she would also have to figure out how to get to and from school since her parents live 3 hours away.", "I love how your parents called you abusive for getting your sister to babysit once, while they have pushed their adult daughter on you and don't pay her bills. If I were you, I'd send her home. This is super disrespectful and she needs a reality check. If she gets upset tell her that she isn't your kid and not your responsibility - echo this sentiment to your parents too.", "Requesting relationships be a two-way street is not being an AH, it's avoiding toxicity in your life.", "Op probably needed the money from the extra shift to help her pay for her entitled sister", "Honestly though, she doesn't have a job so she has plenty of time to focus on her studies even if they were asking her to babysit for a couple hours daily. I don't even think it's a reasonable boundary unless she's being asked to do it during class times or during all of her free time.", "Honestly the sister should have responsibilities in the house. When we were all in college (at the dorm or own apartment) we had responsibilities-laundry, cooking and keeping common areas clean as well as studying. \n\nBig sis doesn't have to give her kid sis a responsibility free ride.", "This.\n\nOP, this is what you send your parents:\n\n\"Since you believe it is a abusing my power over my sister, lets discuss this. She is not my kid. I have no responsibility for her yet I provide a roof over her head and food for her belly free of charge. She is a member of my household who contributes nothing. It is NOT expecting too much for her to pitch in and babysit on occassion or do household chores on occassion. That is part of being a member of a household. If it is too much for her to handle contributing to the household in which she lives with occassional babysitting or other menial responsibilities that contribute to the upkeep of the home in which she reside. Ifyou do not like this, then she can begin paying rent in $X amount which will then cover the utilities, food and her portion of the rent.\"\n\nOP, when you break it down financially my bet is that their song will change.", "I agree with you! Our father never made me, my mother, the girl we took in, or any of my sibblings run the entire home to the point where we never had free time. He divided the chores (including babysitting one another) according to our age, abilities and the amount of time we had. For instance, my oldest sister would always pick us up after school and walk us home (her middle school was next to our elementary school, we live in Poland and it was a relatively normal thing in the early 2000's), my mother would cook lunch for us, and me, my brother and younger sister would usually do the dishes afterwards, while my other sibblings spent the afternoon studying, since they had more homework due to being in higher grades.", "OP doesn't say they are living on base or anything.  So little sister may not really be living in \"a military environment\".", ">she did \u201cabuse her power\u201d\n\nNo she didnt lmfao", "There was absolutely no \"abusing power\" here.\n\nSister is deadweight in this houehold. She contributes nothing. Nada. Zilch. She is an adult who is living off the largess of her single mother sister. \n\nOP asked for some help and Sister acted like a spoiled brat. Why the heck would OP want to continue paying the bills for some selfish brat living in her house who won't even deign to babysit on occassion. How is it abusing her power for OP to have the reasonable expectation that sister will pitch in on occassion to help the household in which she lives rent free?", "And like, the reason OP is able to  fund her sister is her job. So if the reason the sister is expected to watch the baby is because of the job, she should agree to if not for any reason but securing the source of her funds. OP im sure wouldn\u2019t be fired over missing one shift, but that\u2019s not a line you want to start skirting.", "I hate children. Period, full stop.\n\nIf/when my sister acquires children, my niblings will be the exception. Or even if they aren't and I still hate them, they sure as hell will never find out. It's different when it's your sibling's kid. Don't ask me why, it just is.\n\nThat being said, I am also in college and school is hard. Depending on what she was planning to get done (even if it was \"nothing\" read: resting, which is equally important) it really could throw a wrench in her week. If she were willing to watch him in her spare time I would go n a h. But it doesnt sound like that's the case. NTA", "You made me laugh out loud.", "Plot twist, work is the asshole. What would your work have done if you didn't have someone to watch your kid? So often in society we drop everything to fulfill a \"work need\" but rarely is that held up as the exceptional and remarkable thing it should be. \n\nRegardless, there clearly needs to be a conversation about expectations between OP and their sister.", "This. Honestly, OP, I would sit down with your sister and write out an agreement. Tell her that she is either \"family\" or a tenant you don't want living with you. If she is family, she lives there for free and helps out as needed. If she's a tenant, she can either start paying you X amount per month, and you'll have money to line up emergency sitters, etc., or she can move back in with your parents. \n\nYou can also make it clear that if her go-to thing is to go to your parents and complain every time you do anything, she can leave now. You're doing her a favor. You don't need flying monkeys sent for you.", "At 15 I was helping out with my nephew. I was also a high school dropout (because of unaliving attempts I got my GED the second I turned 16) and lived with my mother, the druggy baby mama and my druggy brother.\n\nWatching a 1 year old is way less stressful than watching a 3 month old but when I visited my nephew (the same one I helped raise. He grew up to be a great guy!) And his wife had to go pick up the older daughter I sat there and watched his little 3-month-old!\n\nFamily helps each other out. (Disclaimer: shitty toxic family can go sit on a fence post)", "This is *exactly* where my mind goes when I hear \"churlish.\"", "This. Yea she has responsibilities but is one a job? She's in college. That's probably not more than 3 hours a day. She can pitch in. This is crazy."]}
