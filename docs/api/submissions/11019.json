I got called in on a Saturday (I\u2019m off weekends and the daycares closed weekends) and I pleaded with my sister to watch my son.  She refused, and told me it was her weekend off from school and she had a lot of studying to do. I told her I really needed her to do this for me, I never ask her. She told me I should just find a sitter online. I told her no, you need to watch him, I take care of you and you can do this one thing for me, or you can go back and live with our parents.\n\nShe got really upset and said I\u2019m throwing what i do for her in her face, and how she\u2019s an adult and my son wasn\u2019t her kid. She did agree though and I went to work. While I was on break I checked my phone and had numerous text from my parents saying I was abusing my power over my sister, and that my son wasn\u2019t her responsibility. \n\nI never ever ask my sister for help with the baby.

Your working is what is allowing her to live rent free, and have nothing to worry about. Hell, you are supporting her.\n\nIf your sister didn't live with you, your financial situation would be a little better as you would not be supporting another adult as well. Everyone saying that you are taking advantage of her, look at it this way. Sister can go live on campus, pay room and board, and support herself. Then OP may not have to work additional hours.\n\nOPs sister is the entitled one as are the parents. I'd advise my sister to start looking for new housing and ways to support herself. Stop using being in college as an excuse to freeload. Many people go to college full-time and are able to support themselves. I had ZERO assistance while in college and had to balance school and work. To not have to worry about anything other than school in exchange for occasionally watching my niece/nephew/sister would have been a blessing.", "NTA  \napparently a lot of people in this thread think a one time babysitting day is worse than being kicked out and either having massive debt or a part time job.", "Your sister needs to go. Or stop leeching you off and support you in cash or kind. Where are your parents in all this mess? Why are you supporting her since school when you have your parents? Your sister is ungrateful. She needs to leave. \nOn the flip side think about this. Your son is very young. Someone aged 18 with no motivation to babysit or help you out would then out to be horrible sitters.", "NTA you're supporting her. She's living there for free. Your work called you in when your daycare was closed. You'd think she'd have more concern that you keep your job considering it's literally keeping a roof over her head and food in her belly. I did my whole undergrad raising 2 children and I did a BS in molecular and cellular biology, so you can't tell me she couldn't handle watching your baby while she studied. She just didn't want to. She needs to step up and start contributing and be more appreciative of what you're doing for her... before she finds her ass out on the curb.", "NTA.\n\nIt was an emergency and you couldn't get a sitter in time. I can't imagine living with a family rent free and saying no to doing one favor.", "Nta and frankly reddits army of people who -at least in theory- would always have a plan in place always keep their calm and explain in well situated words every little mondane thing annoys me. It's not to much to ask. If she does not want to help you, you should absolutely stop helping her. She is not a child.", "When your parents call you next time say just how your child is not your sisters responsibility their child is not your responsibility and you're cutting her off ..they can have her back and pay for everything\n\nSMH\n\nIt was just this once I mean seriously,?

Your sister has absolutely zero obligation to watch your kid, and threatening her with her literal housing to make her do what you want is absolutely an abuse of power. Your kid is always your responsibility, and it's on you to either find a babysitter, tell your boss you can't come in on such short notice due to lack of childcare options, or bring your baby into the office if possible and your boss insists on having you there. \n\nThat said, I would think that your sister could help out when needed, within reason. We don't know, and maybe you don't either, how much homework/studying your sister needed to get done. She has her own obligations. But unless I had a midterm or major project that I needed to do, I would feel pretty crummy refusing to babysit for someone doing so much for me. \n\n\nFinal note: considering the way you extorted her into babysitting, I would be surprised if she did more than the absolute bare minimum watching your kid.", "I don\u2019t get why people are voting YTA. OP\u2019s sister is living with her for *free* and refuses to do a *one-time* favor. That\u2019s the height of selfishness and entitlement. OP is being taken advantage of for free rent, because the sister clearly lacks family feeling. I would tell the sister to leave, because she\u2019s an adult and old enough to take care of herself.

It would be different if the agreement was, \u201cyou can live with me rent free and not worry about anything, as long as you watch baby should an emergency ever come up,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t sound like that was a discussion that has been had. \n\nYour son is not her responsibility and it sounds like she is trying to be responsible and repay you for helping her through school by studying hard. Kids are one hell of a distraction, as I\u2019m sure you know, and I doubt she got any studying done while you were at work. Did your work force you to go in? I highly doubt it. It would have been just as easy for you to tell them, \u201cI can\u2019t come in because I don\u2019t have a sitter,\u201d as it would have been for your sister to agree to watching your son.", "YTA. Taking care of the kid wasn't not a part of the agreement. That's your kid, not hers. Kick her out, and don't be mad when she resents you or doesn't talk to you.

It's one thing to say \"you can live with me for free for the convenience of school but on occasion I may need you to watch my son\", however it's entirely different if that is not the agreement. You can't unilaterally decide to change the terms (except if you want to kick her out, that's of course you're decision). She is allowed to say she'd rather move out than have to be a babysitter though.", "YTA - this one borders on E S H, it would be nice if your sister helped you out but she is in no way obligated to do so. You don't have to accept the shift, your inability to find child care at short notice should be good enough of a reason.\n\nThe fact that you expected her to drop what she needs to do to help you makes you the AH in the first place, but the fact that you threw everything you are doing for her in her face exacerbates the issue. Threatening to kick her out because she didn't help you ONE time with no notice is the cherry on the (ass)whole cake.\n\nYou need to apologise to her and perhaps discuss going forward that sometimes you may need babysitting services at short notice and that you feel that it is fair because of all you do for her. However, this is a discussion that needs to be had ahead of time, not in the heat of the moment, and definitely not with any threats of eviction.  \n\n\nETA you should also talk to your parents about contributing to her food and/or rent to ease the burden on you, and allow you to pay for a sitter (maybe even her) even at short notice", "NTA \n\nI don't understand these esh verdicts.

Travel 6 hours to and fro for college. Work on weekends to earn her own keep.", "NTA and everyone saying you are stupid. You needed her to babysit for an emergency one time and she refused? That is unacceptable and such shitty entitled behavior.", "tell your mum her kid isn't your responsibility and ship her back home dude", "YTA. You\u2019re the parent, it\u2019s your job to find child care. You can also say no to getting called into work. Not hold what you do for your sister over her head. Her job is school and she said no she has studying to do.", "NTA. Yup, she\u2019s an adult. So she can get a part time job while she studies and start paying rent and for her food. You asked her as a one off in an emergency, if she can\u2019t do that for you then she needs to start pulling her weight in terms of rent and groceries.", "NTA. You are taking care of your sister full time, but she can\u2019t take care of your child for one day?

She's the AH for that.", "Unless it had been discussed and agreed to in advance that you may in an emergency need her to baby sit then YTA \n\nYou are an AH for forcing her by threatening her living situation. Yes its your place and you let her stay without paying rent, and you have every right to kick her out for whatever reason. But you agreed to let her stay rent free while she went to school. You don't get to agree to something in advance then later alter the deal with no notice, all for your own convenience and not be an AH. You WILL be an extra huge AH if you carry out that threat.

Hope you have a serious talk to her about her attitude and if she doesn't like or won't be willing to help if needed on the rare occasion in the future ask her to move out.\nShe doesn't know how good she has it.", "YTA - Babysitting is not a condition of room & board. She is not your on demand babysitter. You were not concerned about her obligations only your own. Being called into work implies you had the option to decline.", "YTA. Mainly because this wasn\u2019t something agreed upon before, and if she\u2019s in college, you should be more than aware that most people\u2019s midterms are this week.

And usually im against the parents pushing their kids onto others. But not this time.\n\nIf your sister is auch an adult, maybe she can pay you rent. Seems like shes just mooching off you atm, a full time worker and a full time mum to not only your own child but also your adult sister. \n\nSeriously, the deal your sister is currently getting is awesome. Free rent etc. While she studies? I wouldve killed for that. I definitely wouldve done some occasional baby sitting for it.", "NTA\nTime for her to go back to mammy and daddy though!", "NAH", "Simply put, I would tell her that as she is and adult, if she isn\u2019t going to help you once in a while without complaint, she needs to find a new place to live.

Your sister isn\u2019t your responsibility either but you\u2019re still providing for her.", "NTA. It's a sudden emergency and it's a one time thing, I think the sister is a bit entitled with the \"I don't owe you anything\" while basically ignoring the fact you're doing her a favor by letting her live with you and not asking for anything. The baby might not be her child but that's her niece/nephew, not a stranger's baby. \n\nI have a sister with baby too and every event we do together I automatically accept without conditions or prior discussion that I'd watch the child if she suddenly needs me too. If I lived with her rent free, I'd appreciate it if she informed me beforehand but otherwise I'd still watch the baby for her in this situation, provided I had no emergency of my own to deal with.", "YTA. She may not be employed but right now studying is her job. How would you feel if your husband threatened to kick you out because he was on call and had to leave for an emergency but you couldn\u2019t miss your shift? It\u2019s the same exact thing.

I suggest getting to know some neighborhood babysitters and asking your sister to move out. The entitlement she and your parents have is just unbelievable and not necessary in your life! Who needs drama and family like this!!", "Nta, start charging her rent and utilities. She can start to pay her own way as an adult. Then use said money to hire a babysitter.", "NTA. Helping out the people you love should be a natural thing. You helped out your sister because you love her, and she should have done the same for you. Honestly though, this is a normal stage for a lot of people. When you're 18 you're still likely to be completely self-obsessed and to know nothing about the real world. She has no clue AT ALL what having a job is like, or having kids, or just being an adult. She's not selfish because she doesn't love you, she's selfish because she's stupid and young (hopefully). I honestly think you should start charging her rent, because teens who get a free ride through college can easily fall flat on their face once they graduate and get shoved into the real world. I don't think it's great to kick kids out of the nest at 18, but it's also just as bad to coddle them until they're 22. You know what I bet will happen if you tell her she has to start paying rent? She's going to be mad and indignant and start researching how to get her own apartment, and she's going to learn about rent costs, utilities, etc, and that might be all she needs to see what you are doing for her and to maybe not be quite as selfish going forward. And, even more importantly, if she starts paying rent (or utilities) now, she'll get to be slowly eased into adulthood instead of being dropped into it a few years from now.", "NTA. It was an emergency. Sister sounds like an entitled brat.", "NTA\n\nYou're doing her the big favour of letting her live with you without compensation from her, or presumably, your parents.

And study time is a valid reason not to babysit.   \n\nYou could have refused the shift.  (You usually work and have daycare take care of your child which is reasonable).  \n\nIf weekend work means you don't have daycare available you refuse the work.  Period.  You don't make it so that your sister feels she has to be a part-time babysitter or get booted from her home.", "NTA. If the baby isn't her responsibility, then she isn't your responsibility.

Unfortunately this life does not allow us to be perfectly angelic at all times if we want to survive.  So we can do our dirty business and apologize later, but we really should apologize, just to recognize the hardship we caused.  Don't be another narc.  Choose humility, OP.  It'll feel better.", "If she's \"not into kids,\" then she shouldn't have chosen to live there.", "Great, sister doesn\u2019t have to babysit during emergencies and Op isn\u2019t required to house her for free.", "Sounds like sister should take on the responsibility of housing, feeding and financing herself then when she chose which college she went to, doesn't it? Or does adult responsibility and \"consequences of choice\" only work one way?", "Op\u2019s sister should move back in with her parents in that case. It\u2019s got to be burdensome to be financially supporting an adult sister and her child at the same time. If Op only has to take care of herself and her son, she probably wouldn\u2019t need to work an extra shift.", "Sister is also benefiting from the job OP needed to go into. OP loses that job then sister loses the sweet deal of no living expenses while in college, so ultimately sucking it up and babysitting is in the sister\u2019s best interest.", "I\u2019m saying she does know how to take care of babies though", "You know what that\u2019s actually a few thought out points that I didn\u2019t think of.\n\nI agree it was offered as a solution and it therefore shouldn\u2019t be held over her head, however I just personally believe that family should help one another. It wasn\u2019t a super big inconvenience to the sister to just have the baby in the room with her though that could depend on the length of the shift. \n\nAnyway you did make me reconsider a little bit, and now im not sure what to think.", "Haha, I doubt that the sister is on the lease, therefore she has no legal standing and OP can kick her out without having legal issues. OPs sister is an entitled AH who couldn\u2019t do this one favor, so I hope OP is reading this and sends her sister back to her parents.", "Sister did study and watch the baby, just complained to her parents that this wasn't part of the arrangement, which it wasn't.", "Exactly. OP can decide to stop providing if sister doesn't help. However, the sister absolutely had the right to say no when it was suddenly sprung on her. OP has the right to withdraw support now, but that doesn't mean it wasn't an AH move in my opinion.", "Yes, OP does. That was not OP's question. In my opinion, OP is the AH for forcing this on her sister when that wasn't part of the agreement. She'd be in her right to change the deal now or to kick her sister out, but had no reasonable expectations during this particular argument.", "This", "Yeah I agree the sister is the parents problem to deal with, not op. But op did agree to these things, so.. it seems like a weird situation to me. she should probably sort out a proper agreement without letting the sister take advantage as much, or let her know it\u2019s time to find a new place.", "But she clearly doesn't want to do it.  Taking care of your child is not going to be her #1 priority, even if you can \"make\" her do it.  You really shouldn't want to leave your child with someone who is disinterested in and resentful of caring for your child.  In my book, YTA, as much for not caring about the quality of care your child will be receiving as for coercing your sister to provide the care.", "Studying can be intense..... There's not a good way to study and watch a young child like that at the same time. They both need undivided attention.\n\n\nYes you should help family. Help must come freely though. You can't call it ' helping family \" when it's you blackmailing someone. It's unethical.", "THIS THIS AND THIS. OP please withdraw your support and make her pay her own bills.", "you are saying the less asshole move between: a one off babysitting day ,and being kicked out and having to start a job while in school or get into massive debt is the second option?", "Tbh I don\u2019t feel like Op gives off the vibe that she had much of a choice in the arrangement. I feel like Op is a pushover and this incident is the first time Op insisted on her sister\u2019s help. Any genuine adult knows that Op is being pretty got damn generous with her sister. I moved back home so I could pay for my masters program. I\u2019m making 700 $$ school payments and I still have to pay my family 1000 $$ in rent. The fact that Op\u2019s parents heard that Op forced her lil sister who\u2019s living rent free in her house to babysit ONCE and chewed Op out over it makes me feel like the family dynamic is probably toxic. Op should definitely give her sister the boot- that way everyone in the situation only has to worry about their own actual kids.", "Then why is op caring for her younger sister? Or is it just that the oldest is responsible for the younger ones all their life?", "You think a stranger from online would be better suited to babysit in this emergency?", "This comment section is WILD."]}
