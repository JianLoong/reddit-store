It is not fair of them to expect you to take care of her in the future. Under no circumstances agree to move out together with her in three years' time when you might be able/looking to move out, not even if your parents offer to pay for a house for you and your sister to live together. It will be a total nightmare and you will regret it every single minute. Your sister needs specialist care and that's not something you should be expected to do. You have your own life to live.\n\nIt sounds like you are limited in your life because of your sister's quirks/needs/demands. I don't think that's right. Start planning for your future. Maybe you can already figure out if there are scholarships you can apply to if you want to continue going to school/go to uni after you finish high school. Doesn't hurt to get a weekend/evening job and save that money for yourself somewhere your parents/sister won't know of and won't be able to access.", "Nta, but you don't have to argue with your parents about it. Just nod along and let it go. And when you turn 18, talk to an attorney about what you need to do legally to make sure you aren't her care provoder", "\"It sounds like you two just had me to care for sister when you aren't able to anymore.

They should be getting her disability and then possibly if she is violent she needs to be in a home or something. \n\nYou have a right to a reasonable life at home until you were 18 where you have reasonable activities and reasonable control over your leisure time and where you\u2019re not just a babysitter for somebody who\u2019s not disciplined, and is out of controlled \n\nSpend as much time elsewhere as you can \n\nIt\u2019s up to you whether you want to escalate this by reporting it I don\u2019t know how that would work out. I don\u2019t know if it would help your situation at all. \n\nYou might want to ask your parents for counseling it needs to be private, something where they don\u2019t get any information from the therapist \n\nAnd then discuss with the therapist how to handle this, because I think you need advice from an adult who is educated about the specific sorts of situations \n\nIf you know how to get hold of a social worker, perhaps the school nurse or something you might wanna have a conversation with that person", ">I wasnt born to serve her\n\nHoney, I think you probably *were*.\n\nShe was 10 when you were born, your parents *knew* what her needs were going to be. There is a trend of parents of special needs kids having more kids *specifically* so that someone will be there to take care of their sibling down the line.\n\nNTA at all. You need to get a job and hide as much money as possible so that you can move out the minute you turn 18. Never look back. You deserve to love your life. If you have to, pretend that you thought about it and changed your mind. Tell them that you need a good job so that you can take care of her, that you need to have enough money saved up to get ahead so that you can do what you need to. Then run. Run far, and run fast.", "NTA. My son is nonverbal, autistic, super high needs. And he's MY responsibility. I get your parents being terrified at the thought of what will happen to her when they go, but that ain't on you. I hate that you've had to cater to her so much and it's ruined whatever relationship y'all could have had. I hope when you eventually move out you'll be able to get some perspective on some of her actions and not hold everything against her. For instance, someone had to teach her to be racist. That's crazy to me.", "NTA and how TF is she in university if she gets violent like this? Study your ass off, get into a good university and get out of there like The Flash the minute you graduate highschool.", "NTA. They may have had a second child to provide her a caretaker.

There are also socializing opportunities for her.\n\nThis is a problem your parents created and you're not responsible to give up your life. Make a plan for what to do when you finish school. If you go to college, leave the area.", "NTA. Your parents probably had you so you could take care of your sister later in life. My brother was trying to do the same but they were unable to have any more kids.", "Go along with what they say for the moment regarding what happens after they are gone as it's not yet relevant. However, I suggest you become independent as soon as you can as an adult so that they don't force you to stay at home since they plan on you taking care of her. You have a right to your life. I have an autistic daughter and she has caregivers. There is no way I would bully my other daughter into caring for her. Make sure you don't let your parents push the responsibility onto you. If you need to speak to a social welfare worker about this, go ahead. There may be options in your community to help care for your sister. Seeing that she is taken good care of doesn't mean that you yourself have to be the caregiver.", "NTA. You should not be expected to take care of her. The responsibility is solely your parents'. Preparing for the day they won't be around anymore is on them, as well.\n\nHowever, there might be consequences if you won't commit to taking care of her\n\nWhen you turn 16, you might want a car. When you turn 18, you might want/need financial help from your parents so you can go to college. From ages 18 to 25, you might want to continue being covered by their health insurance. In return for all that help, they might want assurances from you regarding her future care.\n\nYour best strategy might be to just play along without committing to taking care of her.", "NTA. I'm sure they love you both a lot, and probably lost their way with focusing on your sister. They are forgetting that though you don't have physical brain-based needs, you have emotional needs as a neurotypical person. \n\nThe thing is, though, that they are kind of assholes for pushing her onto everyone. Focusing so much on being advocates for her is taking away the rights of many others. If she is mentally ~9, why is she at an expensive university?  Is it in person? Is she disruptive? What's the end goal is she can't function in a job. It seems their want of giving her \"a normal life\" is at many other people's expenses, most notably yours.", "NTA get away as fast as you can and seek Therapy", "Get a good education.  Make getting the very best grades your sole purpose and focus  so you can get good scholarships to colleges somewhere far away.  Until you can get yourself out of this situation on your own you will end up stuck there.  You want to have near perfect scores in all your work.

You have every right to find an appropriate program for her to live at. Frankly I think it is healthy for adults with disabilities to have a chance to live their own lives. Being responsible for your sister may just mean paperwork and visits like any sibling. Even if your parents are expecting you to devote your life to her - once you have legal guardianship, it\u2019s your choice to decide what is in everyone\u2019s best interest. \n\nBut NTA - you are right that you have a right to your own life.", "NTA - OK this might be just me. But you don't have to say anything. Just do your best in school for now. If you decide to join the military, then just go and don't go back. Tell them after basic. If you decide to go to college, then tell them at graduation. My thing is why tell them now, just to get a lot of hassle about the issue? Set your life up first before making any decisions. Also, keep in mind that there are a lot of care facilities that can take her. This is something you can look at now or later. There is no concern until you are a legal adult. For now, do what others on here have suggested. Just agree with everything and keep your head down.", "NTA  Be polite but firm in your refusal to take care of your sister and continue to make plans for your future. Even though you're only 15 you need to start working towards figuring out how you'll finance college or rent if you're not planning on going. You will not have any support so you need to get moving now.", "NTA- You're in your rights to decline to take care of her. Not only that, everything you've been limited to in life, I can tell you just want to be done with her when you turn 18. You deserve to have a happy life without limitations and have peacefulness.\n\nAlso, I know she has the mentality of a 9 year old, but I feel she's pretty smart with manipulation, given how she has your parents get on you about liking certain music, movies, and romantic interests.", "Three more years and you're out of there.  \n\nStart thinking now about what you might like to study or the kind of career you might enjoy and be good at.  Make sure you take the high school classes you need to get into the kind of program you want, and talk with your guidance counselor about scholarships or starting off in community college.  If you want vocational training, do research about how to apply.\n\nFor now, you can smile and nod and say you'll think about it.  Then get out.  It isn't your destiny to care for your sister if you don't choose to do so.  There are all kinds of social services to help DD adults.  There are social workers, sheltered workshops, and group homes.  It sounds like your parents aren't really using these services and assuming, instead, that you'll do all the work.\n\nI realize that 3 years feels like forever at 15, but I promise you a far better future.\n\nNTA", "NTA. God gave you free will, so you can choose to use it. maybe she could go into a care situation and you could ensure she is being treated well and they arent neglecting and abusing her. but actually stopping your life for her is a huge call and you do not need to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Another parent had their adult child take classes but their student had such high social anxiety, the student would literally run out of class in the middle of class multiple times a class period for multiple weeks.

It's not \"God's Plan\" for you to sacrifice your your life.  \nYou were not born solely to be her caretaker.  You were born for something much more than that.  Your parents have no right to destroy one child to take care of another, especially when there are much better options.  \n\nIn the meantime, collect all your importantant documents and keep them in a safe place, save all the money you can, do not sign anything your parents hand you, and move out as soon as you turn 18.  \n\nGood luck.", "This is so very far away from rude or mean. Of course you deserve your own life. Your parents need to work out her future. I would work on getting out of the house and on your own as a primary goal. Keep your plans silent so that you don\u2019t get undue pressure from them. Good luck.", "NTA. You are completely right, your parents cannot cite God in this, that is so manipulative. Get yourself as independent as you can when it is safe to do so and seek support e.g legal, citizens advice to make sure this is unenforceable.", "You have your own life to live it is unfair for parents to try to place this on you.  Your sister needs alternative housing or a group home . The stress of being a sibling with any one with special needs is difficult. Love you're life your not an asshole your parents are", "It will be interesting to know if they plan on paying for your university as well considering they think your purpose in life is to take care of your sister - which would mean there\u2019s no point in educating you", "NTA get into college (live in a dorm) , graduate, get a job and then tell them you will never take care of your sister.", "Nah. Unless you change your mind which is highly unlikely, your parents need to start saving for someone to care for your sister. Nobody can force you to do anything remember that. If you don\u2019t have a job, get one and start saving all money so if they expect this at 18 you can leave with an exit strategy.", "NTA. Time to start making some plans. Save your money somewhere safe. If you find a chance to get your birth certificate and social security card out of the house into a safe place (do it). Maybe you can have a friend who will let you have mail coming to their house. You should be thinking about your future and what type of college you\u2019ll want to go to. Don\u2019t discuss leaving home to college. You will set them all on alert. Any schools you are interested in, have the catalogs sent to your friends house. You are going to have to literally make your escape to college. Apply for every scholarship and grant you can. This is going to be a long, difficult journey, not a sprint. You have the time. Your other option is the military. Good luck.", "NTA.  she needs more specialized care.  it seems like your parents aren't willing to accept that.  it wouldn't mean they failed as parents if they were to place her in a facility that specializes in dealing with people with her diagnosis.  it just means that they love both her and you to put her in a place that can care for her better.  but that also shows that they love you because they're willing to protect you.  cause right now she hits your dad.  one day, it could be you she hits (if she hasn't already).  I think they're trying too hard to keep her out of a place that could benefit her greatly.  and benefit you as well.", "Absolutely you are NTA, and you should be trying your hardest to avoid being roped into this. Your parents need to make proper arrangements for your sister's ongoing care, not just assume that you'll take care of it.", "NTA start to plan your escape, she is not your responsibility.", "NTA", "As someone who has chosen to be my sister\u2019s carer once my mother passes on? NTA. This is your choice.\n\nI can understand your parents - they are afraid. They know their child cannot support herself or function in society, and they see you as the easy way out, so they are unfairly placing the burden on your shoulders. \n\nDepending on the country/state you live in, there may be several options for your sister\u2019s future living prospects - shared housing accommodations, or a small but functional apartment with support workers coming in to assist with cooking, cleaning etc. But these are burdens for your parents to deal with, NOT YOU.\n\nIf you are feeling truly distressed by this, go to a school counsellor or some other adult you can trust and tell them that the expectation of caring for your sister is causing you mental and emotional damage.", "NTA completely reasonable.", "Considering the age difference, it kind of seems like you were born to be her slave. Not that you in any way should be.", "LOL \"god\"\n\nNTA", "i think you might change your mind if you parents live another 20 years or so.", "NTA.\n\nIt's obvious your parents sadly only had you to be a caretaker for your sister. You are in no way obligated to care for her. Your parents have had more than enough time to look for and prepare other options - a care home, a private carer, savings, therapy, etc. Your sister is 100 % their responsibility, not yours.", "NTA! I was always told I'd look after my schizophrenic half-brother and never argued the point. This was in the 70's when things were different. However, life isn't planned, and both parents died before I was 21. Two weeks before my mum died, she told me I had to get a life for myself. It was only with hindsight that I realised I never should have been placed in that position in the first place.\n\nYour parents are responsible for your sister, not you. There will be places where she will be better suited, with qualified staff and where she will get the care and support needed. \n\nWell done, in realising this isn't your purpose in life. I wish I'd had your strength when I was younger. Stay strong about this. You deserve the best life you can have. Life is hard enough, and you don't know what your future holds. Take care and look after yourself.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour parents are doing her and you a great disservice by just giving in to her tantrums. If she's capable of going to university, she's capable of learning how to handle her big emotions. It's sad that your parents haven't put effort into finding ways for her to learn that, and instead think her life should be an endless stream of people giving into her wants and fits.", "NTA, your purpose in life is to create a good life for you. Do that.

You may have to continue to be clear for a very long time", "NTA - you can not fulfill that, not now and not in the future. Your sister will need professional help at some point. \n\nApart from being totally unfair to you (major point, why you should not do it), it would not work anyway. the dynamic is currently, that she can define what you can and can\u2019t. To be her caregiver, you would need authority over her. But currently no one has real authority over her behavior :(", "For cases like this, your parents either have to get professional help for your sister, or put her in a clinical institution/some type of daycare thing for heavily autistic people if that exists. Its not fair for your lifw to be thrown away because your sister had bad rng when it came to genes, so no, youre not the asshole, youre a kid that wants to live, have fun, do stuff others can do, and thats perfectly normal", "NTA just go along, get a job and save every penny you can, try your best in school and you could get financial aid for post secondary (bc i could see your parents not paying in order to try and force you to stay home and be her caretaker) and once youre able, move out. its odd that she\u2019s in university if shes this limited", "NTA. Move out as soon as you can and never look back", "NTA. Good grief. Best of luck in life and get away from them soon. HUGS!", "NTA. You have the right to have a life of your own, and not a life where you are your sister's carer for decades to come. It is very wrong of your parents to tell you that being your sister's carer is God's plan and your purpose in life. I think that your responsibility for your sister should be limited to a supervisory role only ie your parents should find her a place in a group home or supported living whichever would be best for her and where she would like to be where there are trained carers and then after your parents pass on, you would just keep an eye on her to make sure she is being properly supported. I am autistic.", "That is a cowards way. I agree that it is not her obligation to take care of her sister - 100% not. But that does not mean the sister doesn't need help.\n\nPretending you will do something and then bailing on it means the parents dont have the chance to find care for her. So it is just cruelty and neglect.", "Exactly. I think your parents are awful for putting the onus on you to take care of her. Get the education you need to support yourself and do your best to get as far away as you can.", "This, unfortunately.\n\nMy wife has an autistic older brother and, I hate to say it, she was pretty much his caretaker for most of her life. Now she\u2019s a thousand miles away, living in our little home with our three cats. I still have to remind her that she\u2019s not an asshole for not wanting to take on her brother. And Gods know I\u2019d never force her to.\n\nDo NOT let your life get swallowed by what others expect of you, OP. You are your own person.", "parents are abusive towards the sister too, though mostly in forms of neglect. they spoil and coddle her so that she has no idea how to deal with real life. as an autistic person myself, i used to act like this as anchild. but i grew out of it, because my parents taught me how to behave, and how to cope with meltdowns in public. i still have some issues, but it\u2019s a lot more manageable and i successfully live on my own. i bet you the sister would have been able to as well, if not for the parents .", "OP may not be a native English speaker.

Then RUN.\n\nOh, and so so NTA", "It's not like the parents would take OPs word anyway. It's better for OP to play along until they can get out after turning 18/finishing school instead of risking getting more abuse and being isolated even more. also i doubt the parents are going to die in the next 3 years until OP is considered an adult. Even then I don't really see anyone awarding a 18 year old with no proper job chances custody for their sister with high caretaking needs.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt is not cruelty or neglect. \n\nShe does not bear responsibility for her sister.

Meanwhile OP\u2019S formative years as a young adult will either make or break the rest of her life. Looking after an adult with special needs is *not* something you can do while also trying to get a career off the ground. OP would not have the time to find romance, have a child of her own. And even if she could, at that point the child would be in danger - the sister *hits people*, do you think she\u2019d magically understand hitting an infant is wrong? No, not a little. OP\u2019s life would be on hold.", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility though.

Whether they make her do actual legal custody doesn't matter so much to them, I'm sure, as to make sure she is stuck with the sister, wherever that is.", "I get that its easier but its still the cowards way. If you are confident in your opinions and decisions  - have the balls to stand up for what you believe in.\n\nHer life seems crap there anyway - how much worse can it get? There is already physical and mental abuse going on daily. The parents build the life around the autistic kid and instead of getting her the help she needs they prevent the other child living her life aswell.", ">Maybe they had another kid because they wanted a carer.\n\nI would be surprised if OP was NOT born solely for them to have someone to look after sister.\n\nOP is NTA and needs to reach out to extended family to build witnesses to this pressure", "Of course she doesn't bear the responsibility for her sister. That is obvious. But lying and pretending doesn't improve anything here.\n\nThese parents are indirectly abusive and lowering the life quality of one child because they have failed to increase it for the other.\n\nHiding your feelings in this situation is wrong. The parents need a reality check here.\n\nHonestly, if i lived in that situation i would turn to social workers. I would rather live in a foster home than in a family that clearly doesnt care about my needs. That family needs help. Hiding the cruel truth wont help anyone.", "I get that. Im not saying anything about her sister being her responsibility. Im just saying that lying and pretending is not good for anyone. \n\nI dont really see why im prosecuted for thinking that honesty is a better way to go through life than lying.", "yeah no, i\u2019m autistic, this is just partly autism and mostly an extremely spoiled person", "If they are talking about God, then it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they pulled OP out of school and started homeschooling them.  Refusing to take OP anywhere and not letting friends come over.  So yeah it can get a lot worse!", "She is 15. It does not sound like she has hidden how she feels, but it is not clear whether she can be completely honest without putting her future at risk.

She wouldn\u2019t be removed from the home. She would pay the price for standing up to them.", "Lying and pretending to protect herself is better for the CHILD in the situation to not have her situation worsened. THAT is why. Because it\u2019s better for her to pretend and avoid retaliation for her actual feelings. Honesty will get her punished. Honesty will worsen the situation between her and her parents. \n\nDo not begrudge a minor\u2019s feeling of safety in lying to protect herself because you think her being honest would prevent her from what exactly? Her being honest will realistically end in her being punished. If she lies, she has the chance to get out at 18 without being punished for not wanting to be a caregiver for someone ten years older than her.", "Because OP will probably be punished for honesty.", "Of course. Im not making any decisions here for anyone else. But i think she should at least ask for help. If not for rehousing then just someone to get involved. That is not a normal living situation and noone is on her side - most likely because noone knows.\n\nIts easy to say \"wait 2-3 years until you can move out.\" But its her life. She is pretty much being denied her teenage years and expected to be a parent when she grows up more. That is too much pressure... during an age that is already full of hormones and struggles of her own."]}
