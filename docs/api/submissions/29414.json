Also forgot to mention its online which i shouldve initially stated. hopefully this clears things up\n\nOk this might come off rude or mean but idk I (15F) live with my family and sister (25F) who is very noticeably autistic. She cant really form conversations and has the mentality of a 9 year (not trying to insult her, just putting it into perspective) meaning she cant really function in society. When she dosent get what she wants she screams and cries and throws fits, (crossing her arms hiding in corners pouting etc...) She has never gotten a job and my parents are paying for her extremally costly university and very demanding needs. She is always screaming fighting and hitting my dad whenever he does LITERALLY anything or she dosent get exactly what she wants WHEN she wants it.Anyways, my parents are well aware of this and know someone needs to take care of her once they die or get tired of her. So they've turned to me. They keep saying its ''gods plan'' and my ''purpose in life'' to take care of her. I have never heard such BS.I'm sorry but im not gonna throw away my entire future to take care of my sister. I dont even like her. I get she's autistic but everything i do she HATES If ever play Halloween music, watch marvel films, listen to certain music, etc. She always freaks out and makes my parents get onto me. She limits and controls everything in my life. She's also constantly nagging at me to make sure I romantically like white men????? If she ever finds out a character or music artist I like is black she looses it. Not to mention the fact my mom has stopped getting me stuff I love because ''my sister wont like it'' Why does that apply to me?I just dont get why my parents think I should share and DEVOTE my life to her.

It is not fair of them to expect you to take care of her in the future. Under no circumstances agree to move out together with her in three years' time when you might be able/looking to move out, not even if your parents offer to pay for a house for you and your sister to live together. It will be a total nightmare and you will regret it every single minute. Your sister needs specialist care and that's not something you should be expected to do. You have your own life to live.\n\nIt sounds like you are limited in your life because of your sister's quirks/needs/demands. I don't think that's right. Start planning for your future. Maybe you can already figure out if there are scholarships you can apply to if you want to continue going to school/go to uni after you finish high school. Doesn't hurt to get a weekend/evening job and save that money for yourself somewhere your parents/sister won't know of and won't be able to access.\n\nPS: Some great replies to my comment, so OP do check those out. I would also ask if you have a trusted adult in your life who is not related to your parents at all (so no uncle/aunt, grandparents), but who does know about your home situation and who is willing to help you advocate for YOUR future. Assuming this person will be loyal to you only and NOT to your family, they might be able to help you secure backup documents or help with setting up a separate bank account that only YOU should have access to. Talk to a trusted teacher at school if you do not have a trusted adult in your life.", "Nta, but you don't have to argue with your parents about it. Just nod along and let it go. And when you turn 18, talk to an attorney about what you need to do legally to make sure you aren't her care provoder", "\"It sounds like you two just had me to care for sister when you aren't able to anymore.

They should be getting her disability and then possibly if she is violent she needs to be in a home or something. \n\nYou have a right to a reasonable life at home until you were 18 where you have reasonable activities and reasonable control over your leisure time and where you\u2019re not just a babysitter for somebody who\u2019s not disciplined, and is out of controlled \n\nSpend as much time elsewhere as you can \n\nIt\u2019s up to you whether you want to escalate this by reporting it I don\u2019t know how that would work out. I don\u2019t know if it would help your situation at all. \n\nYou might want to ask your parents for counseling it needs to be private, something where they don\u2019t get any information from the therapist \n\nAnd then discuss with the therapist how to handle this, because I think you need advice from an adult who is educated about the specific sorts of situations \n\nIf you know how to get hold of a social worker, perhaps the school nurse or something you might wanna have a conversation with that person", ">I wasnt born to serve her\n\nHoney, I think you probably *were*.\n\nShe was 10 when you were born, your parents *knew* what her needs were going to be. There is a trend of parents of special needs kids having more kids *specifically* so that someone will be there to take care of their sibling down the line.\n\nNTA at all. You need to get a job and hide as much money as possible so that you can move out the minute you turn 18. Never look back. You deserve to love your life. If you have to, pretend that you thought about it and changed your mind. Tell them that you need a good job so that you can take care of her, that you need to have enough money saved up to get ahead so that you can do what you need to. Then run. Run far, and run fast.", "NTA. My son is nonverbal, autistic, super high needs. And he's MY responsibility. I get your parents being terrified at the thought of what will happen to her when they go, but that ain't on you. I hate that you've had to cater to her so much and it's ruined whatever relationship y'all could have had. I hope when you eventually move out you'll be able to get some perspective on some of her actions and not hold everything against her. For instance, someone had to teach her to be racist. That's crazy to me.", "NTA and how TF is she in university if she gets violent like this? Study your ass off, get into a good university and get out of there like The Flash the minute you graduate highschool.", "NTA. They may have had a second child to provide her a caretaker. Don't do this.\n\nTell them they're doing her a disservice; she's an adult and should qualify for disability services, a group home and whatever else she needs to live with others caring for her. There are also socializing opportunities for her.\n\nThis is a problem your parents created and you're not responsible to give up your life. Make a plan for what to do when you finish school. If you go to college, leave the area.", "NTA. Your parents probably had you so you could take care of your sister later in life. My brother was trying to do the same but they were unable to have any more kids.", "Go along with what they say for the moment regarding what happens after they are gone as it's not yet relevant. However, I suggest you become independent as soon as you can as an adult so that they don't force you to stay at home since they plan on you taking care of her. You have a right to your life. I have an autistic daughter and she has caregivers. There is no way I would bully my other daughter into caring for her. Make sure you don't let your parents push the responsibility onto you. If you need to speak to a social welfare worker about this, go ahead. There may be options in your community to help care for your sister. Seeing that she is taken good care of doesn't mean that you yourself have to be the caregiver.", "NTA. You should not be expected to take care of her. The responsibility is solely your parents'. Preparing for the day they won't be around anymore is on them, as well.\n\nHowever, there might be consequences if you won't commit to taking care of her\n\nWhen you turn 16, you might want a car. When you turn 18, you might want/need financial help from your parents so you can go to college. From ages 18 to 25, you might want to continue being covered by their health insurance. In return for all that help, they might want assurances from you regarding her future care.\n\nYour best strategy might be to just play along without committing to taking care of her.", "NTA. I'm sure they love you both a lot, and probably lost their way with focusing on your sister. They are forgetting that though you don't have physical brain-based needs, you have emotional needs as a neurotypical person. \n\nThe thing is, though, that they are kind of assholes for pushing her onto everyone. Focusing so much on being advocates for her is taking away the rights of many others. If she is mentally ~9, why is she at an expensive university?  Is it in person? Is she disruptive? What's the end goal is she can't function in a job. It seems their want of giving her \"a normal life\" is at many other people's expenses, most notably yours.", "NTA get away as fast as you can and seek Therapy", "Get a good education.  Make getting the very best grades your sole purpose and focus  so you can get good scholarships to colleges somewhere far away.  Until you can get yourself out of this situation on your own you will end up stuck there.  You want to have near perfect scores in all your work.

You have every right to find an appropriate program for her to live at. Frankly I think it is healthy for adults with disabilities to have a chance to live their own lives. Being responsible for your sister may just mean paperwork and visits like any sibling. Even if your parents are expecting you to devote your life to her - once you have legal guardianship, it\u2019s your choice to decide what is in everyone\u2019s best interest. \n\nBut NTA - you are right that you have a right to your own life.", "NTA - OK this might be just me. But you don't have to say anything. Just do your best in school for now. If you decide to join the military, then just go and don't go back. Tell them after basic. If you decide to go to college, then tell them at graduation. My thing is why tell them now, just to get a lot of hassle about the issue? Set your life up first before making any decisions. Also, keep in mind that there are a lot of care facilities that can take her. This is something you can look at now or later. There is no concern until you are a legal adult. For now, do what others on here have suggested. Just agree with everything and keep your head down.", "NTA  Be polite but firm in your refusal to take care of your sister and continue to make plans for your future. Even though you're only 15 you need to start working towards figuring out how you'll finance college or rent if you're not planning on going. You will not have any support so you need to get moving now.", "NTA- You're in your rights to decline to take care of her. Not only that, everything you've been limited to in life, I can tell you just want to be done with her when you turn 18. You deserve to have a happy life without limitations and have peacefulness.\n\nAlso, I know she has the mentality of a 9 year old, but I feel she's pretty smart with manipulation, given how she has your parents get on you about liking certain music, movies, and romantic interests.", "Three more years and you're out of there.  \n\nStart thinking now about what you might like to study or the kind of career you might enjoy and be good at.  Make sure you take the high school classes you need to get into the kind of program you want, and talk with your guidance counselor about scholarships or starting off in community college.  If you want vocational training, do research about how to apply.\n\nFor now, you can smile and nod and say you'll think about it.  Then get out.  It isn't your destiny to care for your sister if you don't choose to do so.  There are all kinds of social services to help DD adults.  There are social workers, sheltered workshops, and group homes.  It sounds like your parents aren't really using these services and assuming, instead, that you'll do all the work.\n\nI realize that 3 years feels like forever at 15, but I promise you a far better future.\n\nNTA", "NTA. God gave you free will, so you can choose to use it. maybe she could go into a care situation and you could ensure she is being treated well and they arent neglecting and abusing her. but actually stopping your life for her is a huge call and you do not need to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Another parent had their adult child take classes but their student had such high social anxiety, the student would literally run out of class in the middle of class multiple times a class period for multiple weeks.

IMO, an idea for your sake and your mental health in the meantime: you could help yourself by doing some research into these options, narrow it down to the better places, maybe outline the process along with adding a few local attorney's information for consultations on how to set up the correct documents and court orders, and present your parents with a developed plan to assist them. Make sure to include the benefits of disabled adults living with others who are peers (of a sort) and the things that are possible for her to get involved with for learning, exercise, minimal hours by law but still paid work that also builds skills including interpersonal skills for severely autistic people. After all, they say you're supposed to take care of her, and you just did - you gave them a way to be prepared, showed you cared about them and your sister enough to find them places where she'll be happier, healthier, and you can keep your future as you wish it to become. Again... they can't force you. The courts could, technically, unless you get ahead of it. I suggest you don't let it go that far. Take steps now. \n(I speak from experience in my family along with being in law enforcement for a long time until I recently resigned for my own health).", "NTA\n\nOP also please remember that you need \u201can adult\u201d to get a bank account at your age.

Block and cut off contact when you can because I can promise you they will never stop trying to shove that stuff into your lap. You didn\u2019t bring your sister into this world, they did. Most parents save up for situations like that or start figuring things like that as soon as they find out. Do not sign literally anything they give you without reading it, and remember that they legally can\u2019t make you do anything once you\u2019re an adult. It might cost you your relationship with your parents but they risked it first by disclosing that they blatantly expect you to throw away your future for someone else\u2019s child. Family be d****d. Real family doesn\u2019t even consider asking that of someone else. You might have to deal with hearing them moan and whine for a few more years but once you move out, whatever you take from them is completely up to you on every front. Besides with todays economy and the expenses of caring for someone with special needs, there\u2019s no way someone as young as you could care for both you and her (no offense) unless you got extremely lucky because any decent paying job requires experience and not to mention you said her capacity to function is extremely low it\u2019s not like you\u2019d be able to work unless it was from home and you\u2019re definitely not gonna get a livable income that way unless again, you have experience and move up the totem pole and that\u2019s assuming you have a healthy work environment.

And this is what is wrong with parents of autistic kids. They are of 2 categories- either parents or selfish monsters. The second is the type who donot actually give a damn about their autistic children. If they cared, they would start saving and applying for whatever social and goverment benefits they can get. They should look for a proper group home. They should look for meds that can make the meltdowns less severe.

Your parents are not handling this well - instead of university, it would have been better to look in to local community centers for disabled adults (I worked at one, they had activities and healthy futures classes and at least SOME training to deal with meltdowns) but I know this might not exist near you.

Not only should they not assume you will be your sisters keeper for the rest of your lives, what is their plan if they die in a car crash tomorrow and you are left alone? You are 15 for crying out loud! Heck what if, god forbid, something happened to you and your sister had no one else?

Your parents don't get to decide what you do with your life.

She could listen to music or books that way. We had a quiet room in the community center people could go in if they overwhelmed/distress. Headphones for you for music if you don't have any yet.

When parents are gone/unable and the sister has to adjust to a group home or facility, it's going to be a really rough adjustment.
