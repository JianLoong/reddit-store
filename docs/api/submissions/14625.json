My mom wanted to fly out and be here for the birth and to be at the hospital with me. My dad died 11 months ago and three months ago mom told me she had started seeing someone. It was a little bit of a surprise but I told mom if she was happy I would be happy for her, but asked her to give me some time before trying to include him with me. She hesitated before saying yes and I know she was likely disappointed that I didn't want him included right away.\n\nLast night she told me she wanted to bring her boyfriend with her when she comes so the two of them could be here/meet the baby together. At some point she mentioned my baby being their grandchild. I told her I didn't feel comfortable with him staying here and being around during a vulnerable time. I suggested we could maybe have that introduction during the get together we have planned for late July/early August. Mom said she didn't want to meet her grandchild and experience this without the man she wants to have by her side for the rest of her life. I told her I didn't feel comfortable with him being here and I love her but it was a no for me. She then said she would just stay in a hotel with him and would come regardless of what I'm comfortable with. I told her she will not be welcome if she comes with him to the hospital and my mom could not believe I would turn her away rather than let him be there for the special moment. She told me she is entitled to move on and to think about how bad I will feel in five years when she's remarried and my baby knows him as grandpa and I denied them the chance to meet when my baby is born. She also said imagine telling my child grandma was kept away because she didn't want to be a widow for the rest of her life.\n\nAfter speaking to me she talked to my grandpa and my aunt who are her dad and sister and they sided with me and said mom should understand where I am at with this.\n\nI woke up this morning to a text from her everyone was on my side and she guesses nobody is actually happy for her chasing her happiness again.\n\nI feel weird and I know mom is angry at me for saying she wouldn't be welcome.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681320880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jtaku/aita_for_telling_my_mom_shes_not_welcome_at_the/", "score": 1512, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Giving birth can be an amazing experience, it can also be hard. Recovering after giving birth is a time when you can also feel pretty crap depending on how birth goes.  When you are tired, and getting to know a new baby, you are vulnerable and let's face it - it is not really the best time for you to be meeting people for the first time.\n\nYour mother is being dramatic. You can call her on her crap and tell her that you are happy that she is happy, but you giving birth is not the time for you to be meeting a complete stranger.  It wouldnt be appropriate if it was her new friend from a hobby she has taken up, and it is not appropriate just because it is her bf. It is absolutely your decision.", "NTA.

Your request is reasonable.", "NTA.\n\nYes your mom is absolutely allowed to move on with her life, but that isn't the issue here. You're going to be in a hospital in an extremely vulnerable position having just given birth to a newborn baby. It is absolutely your decision who can, and can't be there for that, and no one, I repeat NO ONE gets to decide what you should, or shouldn't be comfortable with in that moment except for you. \n\nThis is 100% your call to make, and if your mom doesn't like it then too bad for her.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your special moment so you decide who you want involved.\n\nI guess you mom is feeling guilty about moving on so fast. Because she is blind to the fact that this in not about her and her right to move on. This is about you, you lost a father. You don't have to be ready to move on.

If she wishes not to meet your child right after birth, that is fine.  You wish her and her boyfriend well and maybe you will see them at the event later.\u201d  If I was her bf, I would be horrified at her behavior and tell her to go alone.

Your mom needs a huge reality check here.\n\nFirst of all, this baby is not \"their\" grandchild. \"HE\" is nothing but her boyfriend at this point and yeah...it's not much time since your dad died. Why in the world would she think that even asking if her hookup of 3 months can come along was appropriate?\n\nStay firm.

What you do know is you have grief and you do have impending medical procedures and physical health issues coming through pregnancy, child birth and recovery.\n\nYour mom is fantasizing and romanticising what is a major medical event in your life. Yes, new life comes from the major medical event, but if she has any compassion, she would see that one of the hardest times in your life, losing your dad, will be followed by one of the most physically difficult times, the most emotionally demanding situations imaginable and then the most joyful times. All at once. Just like a freight train of all the best and worst parts of life. She is trying to make the birth of your child about herself. Its wrong. She isn't the main character of your birth story. My kid is 8 and has never once wondered when people visited her in the hospital after she was born.", "NTA", "NTA. It sounds like you've never met your mom's BF, so to have him there at the same time your mom gets to meet your child is no different to you than if she brought in some rando off the street. \n\nIf there's a way for you to meet him in person ahead of time, that could be better in the long run. If not, then she's going to have to acquiesce to your terms.", "NTA, you get to choose who you are comfortable to be around at all times. Doubly so when you have just given birth.

Congratulations on your new baby!", "NTA.\n\nHold firm on this one. You, as the person giving birth, and should be able to determine who is there during that time. Anyone who disagrees is an AH. Please be sure you have people who know that she might try to show up when your baby is born who can deal with her and her new BF.\n\nYour baby isn't going to know (or care) that he (or she) wasn't there at the hospital when they were born. S/he only would know if your mom blabbed it to them.  If your mom is pathetic enough to try to shame you to *her grandkid* years in the future, let her. You can then say that you didn't want a total stranger in the room there when your nurse got you out of bed to use the restroom, and blood ran down your leg because the pad the doctor placed wasn't enough to hold back the blood clot. Or any number of uncomfortable medical things. Or just that you didn't want to meet him right then while you were in the hospital giving birth, which honestly should be answer enough.", "NTA. You get to decide who is there, end of story.", "NTA your mother should understand that this moment is about you, not about her relationship", "NTA- giving birth with a strange man in the room is just a no.  This is the one time that you do get to control who is their and who isn't.

I'd want my wife to find happiness again, but at least let my side of the mattress get cold first...", "NTA. She's playing the guilt/ victim card to get her way. She has moved on. She's allowed to move on. However, she doesn't get to decided when others are ready to let her new BF into their lives. Your pregnancy, delivery, and post partum experience are about YOU, DH, and new baby. She doesn't get to call the shots.

Are you going g to allow her to address him as grandpa, or will you teach child he is Mr. SMITH Or His first name?", "NTA, but your mom certainly is. \n\nCall her out on her emotional blackmail - you absolutely NEVER said or implied she couldn't be happy in her new relationship, you merely set limits on what you are comfortable with at one of the most emotionally and physically vulnerable times in your life.

As her imposing upon, and trying to pressure her daughter is unacceptable. However her moving on with her life with a new partner is not something that anyone gets to judge her for, or say how much time is or isn't appropriate for her to have done that.\n\nThis is not a black and white issue. It's incredibly nuanced, and the experiences everyone has with grief, and loss are so varied, and widespread that it's foolish to judge anyone for how they handle it. As most of us have no idea how we would react were we in an identical situation, until we are faced with it, and when you are your reaction will likely surprise you. \n\nNo one is saying that the daughter should accept this person as some kind of surrogate, or replacement father, or grandfather for her child.

She was angry and rude to her mother. I get she wasn\u2019t handling her grief well, but she didn\u2019t want her mon to live her life at all.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the same case. You told your mom to be happy with her guy, but not to bring him to YOUR life event so soon. This is about you and your baby. Mom is trying to turn it in to her thing. She should not be introducing you to her boyfriend when you\u2019re at your most vulnerable time. If she\u2019s allowed in the delivery room, her sole purpose in being there should be to support whatever YOU need because you\u2019re the person going through a painful and sometimes dangerous medical procedure.

NTA\n\nAlso it\u2019s really weird to me that she ran to tell everybody about this. Was she planning on pressuring you? It\u2019s even weirder she tried to rub it in your face that people sided with you. The pity party feels really narcissistic.", "nta", "NTA.   Honestly it sounds like your Mom needs therapy.  You need to clearly and calmly tell her that not wanting a stranger at the birth of your child does not mean that you don\u2019t want her to be happy.

I\u2019d make it clear that you\u2019d love for her to be there if she can come with support and love but if she\u2019s unable to provide that then she isn\u2019t welcome at the hospital.  You are going through the emotions of bringing new life into the world while grieving the loss of your own father. His absence will be felt and the presence of a new boyfriend would be hard for you.

Nursing takes some practice, you\u2019re bleeding and wearing what is essentially a diaper. Your breasts are leaking and engorged and sore, and if you are able to get a shower in, it\u2019s still messy. Plus you\u2019re exhausted and not likely to get much uninterrupted sleep anytime soon. \n\nBirth is an incredible experience. It\u2019s also hard and exhausting. It is NOT the time to meet someone new. It is NOT the time to listen to your recently widowed mother gush about her new boyfriend while you\u2019re still grieving your father who passed less than a year ago. \n\nShe is being really dense and self centered. It sounds like she rushed into a rebound relationship maybe to escape feeling her grief. Or maybe your father was sick for a long time and she\u2019s just ready. But whatever her situation, this is a totally and wholly inappropriate time for her to push him on you. \n\nIf he has a lick of sense, he\u2019s telling her the same thing. This is *not* the way for her to create the imagined grandparent bond she\u2019s dreaming up. Also, if she\u2019s threatening to tell your unborn child 5 years down the road that you were so mean to exclude \u201cgrandpa\u201d then she might very well be costing her *own* relationship with the child, more than she already has by getting herself kicked out of the delivery room!\n\nMy kids are equally close with all their grandparents. The only one of the 4 of them who was present for their births is my mom. She was there for all but one (who was a c-section). Not being there for his arrival hasn\u2019t affected their relationship at all- it hasn\u2019t even occurred to him that it was different- because he doesn\u2019t remember! My in-laws usually met my new baby a couple weeks after the birth, because that\u2019s when they were available to come. same with my dad- who is happily married to my mom, but who wasn\u2019t welcome by me in the delivery room and who wasn\u2019t usually able to be there for a few days after. Yet somehow, 6-15 years later (depending on the kid), all of the kids are close with all of the grandparents. \n\n\nYour mom is being irrational.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA", "Yeah, that's right, my bad. But, whay I meant is that he will be a step-dad when they get married. Yk, a future step-dad.", "This is like how people call everything \"gaslighting\".", "Future mom\u2019s husband. Op is an adult. He\u2019s never going to be raising her so while *maybe* he will technically be a stepfather to her if he marries her mom, it likely will be more like a friendly adult relationship rather than a paternal one.\n\n\nAnd seriously, mom is ridiculously jumping the gun. She\u2019s only been dating the guy for 3 months! Introducing him as grandpa is so painfully premature. It seems like she is rebounding- perhaps to run from her grief. It\u2019s just as likely this relationship will fizzle as succeed."]}
