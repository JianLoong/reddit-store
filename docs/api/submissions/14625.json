My mom wanted to fly out and be here for the birth and to be at the hospital with me. My dad died 11 months ago and three months ago mom told me she had started seeing someone. It was a little bit of a surprise but I told mom if she was happy I would be happy for her, but asked her to give me some time before trying to include him with me. She hesitated before saying yes and I know she was likely disappointed that I didn't want him included right away.\n\nLast night she told me she wanted to bring her boyfriend with her when she comes so the two of them could be here/meet the baby together. At some point she mentioned my baby being their grandchild. I told her I didn't feel comfortable with him staying here and being around during a vulnerable time. I suggested we could maybe have that introduction during the get together we have planned for late July/early August. Mom said she didn't want to meet her grandchild and experience this without the man she wants to have by her side for the rest of her life. I told her I didn't feel comfortable with him being here and I love her but it was a no for me. She then said she would just stay in a hotel with him and would come regardless of what I'm comfortable with. I told her she will not be welcome if she comes with him to the hospital and my mom could not believe I would turn her away rather than let him be there for the special moment. She told me she is entitled to move on and to think about how bad I will feel in five years when she's remarried and my baby knows him as grandpa and I denied them the chance to meet when my baby is born. She also said imagine telling my child grandma was kept away because she didn't want to be a widow for the rest of her life.\n\nAfter speaking to me she talked to my grandpa and my aunt who are her dad and sister and they sided with me and said mom should understand where I am at with this.\n\nI woke up this morning to a text from her everyone was on my side and she guesses nobody is actually happy for her chasing her happiness again.\n\nI feel weird and I know mom is angry at me for saying she wouldn't be welcome.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681320880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jtaku/aita_for_telling_my_mom_shes_not_welcome_at_the/", "score": 912, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Giving birth can be an amazing experience, it can also be hard. Recovering after giving birth is a time when you can also feel pretty crap depending on how birth goes.  When you are tired, and getting to know a new baby, you are vulnerable and let's face it - it is not really the best time for you to be meeting people for the first time.\n\nYour mother is being dramatic. You can call her on her crap and tell her that you are happy that she is happy, but you giving birth is not the time for you to be meeting a complete stranger.  It wouldnt be appropriate if it was her new friend from a hobby she has taken up, and it is not appropriate just because it is her bf. It is absolutely your decision.", "NTA.

Your request is reasonable.", "NTA.\n\nYes your mom is absolutely allowed to move on with her life, but that isn't the issue here. You're going to be in a hospital in an extremely vulnerable position having just given birth to a newborn baby. It is absolutely your decision who can, and can't be there for that, and no one, I repeat NO ONE gets to decide what you should, or shouldn't be comfortable with in that moment except for you. \n\nThis is 100% your call to make, and if your mom doesn't like it then too bad for her.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your special moment so you decide who you want involved.\n\nI guess you mom is feeling guilty about moving on so fast. Because she is blind to the fact that this in not about her and her right to move on. This is about you, you lost a father. You don't have to be ready to move on. You already told her that you are willing to meet him but not this moment.", "NTA, love you could tell your bio-dad he isn't welcome around you during/after labor. You make the rules. Hard stop.

If she wishes not to meet your child right after birth, that is fine.  You wish her and her boyfriend well and maybe you will see them at the event later.\u201d  If I was her bf, I would be horrified at her behavior and tell her to go alone.

Your mom wants to bring a man you've never met to the hospital while you're giving birth? HELL no. And she said she was coming anyway when you told her no? Your mom needs a huge reality check here.\n\nFirst of all, this baby is not \"their\" grandchild. \"HE\" is nothing but her boyfriend at this point and yeah...it's not much time since your dad died. Why in the world would she think that even asking if her hookup of 3 months can come along was appropriate?\n\nStay firm.

What you do know is you have grief and you do have impending medical procedures and physical health issues coming through pregnancy, child birth and recovery.\n\nYour mom is fantasizing and romanticising what is a major medical event in your life. Yes, new life comes from the major medical event, but if she has any compassion, she would see that one of the hardest times in your life, losing your dad, will be followed by one of the most physically difficult times, the most emotionally demanding situations imaginable and then the most joyful times. All at once. Just like a freight train of all the best and worst parts of life. She is trying to make the birth of your child about herself. Its wrong. She isn't the main character of your birth story. My kid is 8 and has never once wondered when people visited her in the hospital after she was born.", "NTA", "NTA. It sounds like you've never met your mom's BF, so to have him there at the same time your mom gets to meet your child is no different to you than if she brought in some rando off the street. \n\nIf there's a way for you to meet him in person ahead of time, that could be better in the long run. If not, then she's going to have to acquiesce to your terms.", "NTA, you get to choose who you are comfortable to be around at all times. Doubly so when you have just given birth.

Congratulations on your new baby!", "NTA.\n\nHold firm on this one. You, as the person giving birth, and should be able to determine who is there during that time. Anyone who disagrees is an AH. Please be sure you have people who know that she might try to show up when your baby is born who can deal with her and her new BF.\n\nYour baby isn't going to know (or care) that he (or she) wasn't there at the hospital when they were born. S/he only would know if your mom blabbed it to them.  If your mom is pathetic enough to try to shame you to *her grandkid* years in the future, let her. You can then say that you didn't want a total stranger in the room there when your nurse got you out of bed to use the restroom, and blood ran down your leg because the pad the doctor placed wasn't enough to hold back the blood clot. Or any number of uncomfortable medical things. Or just that you didn't want to meet him right then while you were in the hospital giving birth, which honestly should be answer enough.", "NTA. You get to decide who is there, end of story.", "NTA your mother should understand that this moment is about you, not about her relationship", "NTA- giving birth with a strange man in the room is just a no.  This is the one time that you do get to control who is their and who isn't.

I'd want my wife to find happiness again, but at least let my side of the mattress get cold first...", "NTA. She's playing the guilt/ victim card to get her way. She has moved on. She's allowed to move on. However, she doesn't get to decided when others are ready to let her new BF into their lives. Your pregnancy, delivery, and post partum experience are about YOU, DH, and new baby. She doesn't get to call the shots.

Are you going g to allow her to address him as grandpa, or will you teach child he is Mr. SMITH Or His first name?", "NTA, but your mom certainly is. \n\nCall her out on her emotional blackmail - you absolutely NEVER said or implied she couldn't be happy in her new relationship, you merely set limits on what you are comfortable with at one of the most emotionally and physically vulnerable times in your life.
