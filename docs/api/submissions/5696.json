He\u2019s met my family but I haven\u2019t met his until now.\n\nHe invited me to spent Christmas with his family this year.\n\nOn Christmas Day, I got ready. It wasn\u2019t anything overly fancy but I did my hair and make up, put on a nice dress that wasn\u2019t too formal and some nice shoes.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9, Greg, didn\u2019t say anything about that but I noticed that he didn\u2019t put a shirt or anything. He just had his favourite t-shirt on and some gym shorts. I figured he was going to change when we get there.\n\nI drove 2 hours to Slough to get to his family house.\n\nWhen we entered, I was eager to meet everyone and was surprised at the state of things. Half of the people there were in their pjs, some of which could use being washed, some were in their tracksuits and hoodies. I was surprised but I\u2019m not going to judge and I certainly am not going to comment on that, it\u2019s not my place. I just wished he warned me about the dress code.\n\nHis sister and cousins made fun of me dressing up formally. I joked along because what else was I supposed to do.\n\nI thought that was it but no. They were pushy with the food, getting offended when I wouldn\u2019t eat more than a small portion (I eat small portions anyway and the food was just dreadful). The women would make jokes about my look, criticise my life style and hobbies when I mentioned them. Kept asking about kids and telling me I\u2019m wasting my time working. The guys were crude and I was often the butt of their jokes. Worst part of it is that my fianc\u00e9 never defended me and laughed along.\n\nI tried to survive the dinner and get the fuck out of there but things turned when they wouldn\u2019t stop pushing me to have a drink. They just wouldn\u2019t let go even though I said that I was driving. The more drunk they got, the pushier they got. My fianc\u00e9 as well, I\u2019ve never seen him behave in such a way.\n\nWhen I came back from the loo and took a sip of my coke. Someone added alcohol to it, Sambuca, you could smell it a mile away. I spat it out and saw his cousins giggling.\n\nI asked what the fuck, they knew I was driving. My fianc\u00e9 defended them and said it was just a joke and to relax. I replied that I wasn\u2019t going to and I ignored everything but this was too much. He called me a stuck up and the loosen up at least once. He was dead serious.\n\nI grabbed my stuff, told him I\u2019m going home and that he won\u2019t have a ride home if he\u2019s not coming. He said \u201cwhatever\u201d and carried on talking.\n\nI left and drove back home. I\u2019m still angry and confused as to what happened. He\u2019s still not back and last I saw, he\u2019s posting stories after stories of their drunk antics. They haven\u2019t stopped parting since last night and even posted a photo of police at their house (no idea why).\n\n\nIn the mean time, his sister and cousins made all sorts of posts on Facebook about me. Tagging me in all of them, telling everyone what a stuck up,  snobby twat I am. \n\nI\u2019m starting to doubt myself. Did I overreact? Was I the asshole in this situation?", "created_utc": 1672073321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvr58l/aita_for_leaving_during_christmas_dinner_with_my/", "score": 533, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family are horrible people, and I am impressed you lasted as long as you did. \n\nTake note how your fianc\u00e9e acted: he just showed you his true face.

Do you really want this for the rest of your life?", "NTA  But you really should have been more suspicious at the fact that you've been together for 3 years that he still hadn't introduced you to his family. Now we know why. And your boyfriend is one of them. Do you really want that in your life?  He literally joined in the antics against you.

Very, very much NTA.\n\nI know this sub isn't for advice, but my good dude, seriously rethink marrying this guy. That's several layers of awful.", "NTA. Run run run run RUNNNNNNNNNNNN. If you marry him, that awful family becomes your awful family. Is that what you want?! Consider this horrible Christmas a gift. You know what your future looks life if you marry him and if I were you, I would break it off now, before the cops come every Christmas to your home, too.\n\nEdit to add: Consider this-- one horrible Christmas versus a LIFETIME of horrible Christmases. Which is better?!", "NTA. They were disrespecting your boundaries and your bf has now shown his true colors in front of you. Get out of there OP, there was a reason he hadn\u2019t let you see how he acts around his family until now", "NTA, but thank god you haven\u2019t married into this family yet and I hope you haven\u2019t made any formal wedding plans. Don\u2019t walk, RUN away from these people. When you marry someone, you also marry their families and if dont you want this to be an annual tradition for you or have these people RUIN your wedding you need to break it off ASAP.", "NTA. The PJs and casual clothing could just be how their family is, but there's no excuse for treating a guest like that. And it's sad your fianc\u00e9 didn't stand up for you. But, it's probably a good thing you could see what he acts like around family, and that he may not stand up for you in the future again when it matters.\n\nAnd taking it to Facebook? Really? That's so juvenile.", "NTA. Leave and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA at all. Don't doubt yourself, is he still your fianc\u00e9 after all that?", "NTA - now you know why you\u2019ve never met his family until you\u2019re engaged. You will never improve with this family.

This is a wonderful opportunity to learn what your future will look like before it happens. The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come has shown you what all family events will look like with your in-laws.

Try to imagine a wedding with these people.", "NTA - Slough - that should have been your first red flag.  Spiking someone's drink is never cool.  You can remove the tags on your Facebook page.  I have mine set to approve every time someone tags me.  Dump that guy!!", "Whew! What even? NTA!!!!\n\nWhy are you with this man? I don\u2019t know your history but it hurts so much to know you are engaged to someone like this and don\u2019t think there\u2019s any red flags here to dump this guy.", "Nta\n\nYou were lucky to find this out before you got married!\n\nHeed the warning and gtfo!\n\nYou two are incompatible.", "NTA and it\u2019s a big red flag for the relationship but also is getting engaged and not having met the future in laws in 3 years when they only live 2 hours away", "NTA NTA NTA!!!  They were assholes.  Not the dressing thing, but the constantly making fun of you, total asshole move, along with the spiking uour drink.  I would do the same thing.\n\nSorry you had to endure that.  You did not overreact.", "GTFO of this engagement, these people are terrible. NTA", "NTA. You sure this is the guy for you? He didn't have your back.", "NTA you learned what kind of family you'd be marrying into. He's not worried about it, and you should be", "NTA. What a wonderful gift you received with this warning - leave and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA. You don't need to put up with abusive bullshit just because it's your fianc\u00e9e family. And he sounds  a clown too. You need to have a serious conversation with him when he gets back. This is the family that you're marrying into, and if this is your *first* impression, it won't get better.", "NTA. Your fiance has shown his true colors. He has a toxic family who don't tolerate anyone different from them, and when amongst them he reverts to the same. Now that you are forewarned that this is what you have to look forward to in your marriage, you can make better choices.\n\nHaving standards isn't being stuck up. It's called having self-respect, and this family is clearly lacking in this department.", "NTA \n\nThey literally touched your drink?? And essentially poisoned you. Get out that engagement ASAP", "NTA. You put alcohol in my drink? I'm getting the fuck out of here.  And Greg set you up to fail. He's the King of Assholes.", "NTA your fianc\u00e9 pretended for  3yrs to be \u201cone kind of a guy\u201d and it took him an hour in his \u201cnatural habitat\u201d to show you his true colors.\n\nYou had a glimpse of his \u201c Christmas past\u201d and your \u201cChristmas future\u201d - call this your Christmas miracle.\n\nNow you have seen your future life and it is better to act on it - he is not for you, he never was, it was all make belief - do you want a partner who will call you a stuck up, who will laugh with ppl who make fun of you and your life choices and to make matters worse, he lived that life with you\u2026\n\nRun!", "NTA. Honestly I don't think you will be able to maintain a future with your partner after this. You've seen a window of what he can be like and his family. You don't need that.", "NTA and I hate to say it because it\u2019s so clich\u00e9 and I didn\u2019t actually think it mattered but it does, you marry the family too. I love my MIL but my FIL is a piece of work and why we ended up eloping rather than having an actual wedding (okay it was my husband\u2019s inability to deal with his dad, but still)", "Nta. Bullet dodged i presume.", "NTA. Your fiance and his family don't deserve you. Run.", "NTA and behold your future", "NTA - I was ready to say you were from the title, but honey capital N, capital O NO, you didn't over react. What you did is see the true person your fiance is behind his facade. Every one has a true self that they maintain at the beginning of a relationship, and each person takes different amounts of time to show you theirs, and each person has a different level of difference. His sounds really different and is finally coming out. Get out of that relationship if you didn't love what you saw last night. He's going to tell you that's not what he really is, and you need to chill because you know the real him. But no, you don't know the real him, you just caught your first glimpse of the real him, though.", "OP, this is the best thing that could have happened. Now you know the truth about your fiance and his family. Thank your lucky stars you found out before you married into this train wreck. Run. You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA.

You\u2019re not compatible, not in a root sense. \n\n\nNTA.", "Yikes, I think mostly that you\u2019re just not compatible. I know families like that too and I personally wouldn\u2019t want to be involved with them. NTA", "NTA. 3 years! Least you saw that side of him before getting married.  He should have told you more about what his family Christmases,  I.e. dress casual,  heavy drinking.  You could of them planned accordingly,  it's like he set you up then didn't defend you at all and appears to not care you have left!", "NTA. This is a glimpse of your future. He is on board with their actions... Which will likely become his when things settle into marriage. Do with that what you will.", "Nta unless you stay with him. His just shown you who he is and who his family are.", "NTA- you will NEVER hear the end of the mockery from his family about this Xmas, even tho you did nothing wrong.

You got to meet your real fiance and the person you are really marrying. Some people aren't lucky enough to see behind the mask until they say \"I do\". Count yourself lucky.\n\nNTA. Also, don't ignore this as a one off. This guy was in his element and let down his guard with his family. This is who he is.", "Girlllll, end that relationship. Could you imagine exposing your kids to those type of people?! NTA", "NTA. Omg please consider breaking this relationship off. They sound just awful. Idk where one person saw \"your snotty comments\" I didn't. You laughed along at first. Spiking someone's drunk is unforgivable after you've already told them and why! If he'd have been on your side, saw what they did was wrong or defended you I could say ok maybe he's redeemable but just NO. They posted proudly about the cops coming. Oh honey box his stuff up and leave it on the porch. SAVE YOURSELF NOW!", "NTA. I would consider this was the reason he waited to introduce you. Bc they\u2019re jerks and he wanted to wait until you were too emotionally involved to bolt. \n\n1. Who doesn\u2019t warn their SO they are a causal family? I mean it\u2019s just basic courtesy \u201cbabe, god you look good, wee are really informal about Christmas and sorry I didn\u2019t tell you\u201d \n\n2. Why are they trying to get you so messed up you can\u2019t drive, leave or keep your autonomy? \n\n3. You left and they are bashing you all over social media. That\u2019s not toxic (pls note sarcasm). \n\nI think you need to consider if you want this to be your life with him. It\u2019s going to get worse. That was them making a first impression. Yikes", "NTA but your fianc\u00e9 and their family certainly are AH\u2019s. You\u2019ve been given an amazing Christmas gift into your fianc\u00e9 and family by seeing what a future with this family would be like. Run for the hills!", "NTA actually you just saw his true nature and about his family making fun of you it's just the reaction of people without any education or good manners! They feel they are not at your standards and because of jealousy they try to make you feel bad so don't care about them! I encourage you to also enjoy your day without that prick ,make post of how you are happy for being with people who know how to host rather being with your fianc\u00e9 family who show no respect towards you! \n\nDon't let your supposed fianc\u00e9 guilt you on anything because he had the audacity to let his family treat you badly in front of him and even defend them so he is not better! I encourage you to rethink your relationship because you just get a glimpse of what it will be if you decide to enter in that family!", "NTA your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t seem to like you very much. You should get out while you still can unless you think you can become like them. They will never accept you, you will have to stoop to their level to get along. Do you really want to join this family ?", "NTA\n\nOP,     Please close your eyes. \n\nEnvision those people, everything you encountered, especially boyfriend's behavior overall and his treatment of you.

Yes.\n\nDo we care if guests come in a tiara? No.\n\n Nobody in my house gets made fun of. Period. \n\nSpeaks more about the quality of people than anything and that sort of goes for both sides. I get you were uncomfortable but making fun of them in your description was unnecessary. However, that's not the question at hand. Their ridicule of you and how they treated a guest was disgusting.\n\nThe rest of it was an inexcusable shit show. Including and especially your fiance. Ask yourself if this is how you're prepared to live the rest of your life.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Have his things packed up and ready to go when he returns to your home. Place the ring on top of those packages and get the locks changed. They were disrespectful from the start and put your safety at risk by trying to spike your drink. The fact that your fianc\u00e9  did nothing to help you days all you need to know.", "NTA x100. Dude, they spiked your drink. That's crazy behavior. As someone who has struggled with alcoholism for 5+ years now and has worked my ass off to get sober, someone spiking my drink like this could lead to a fatal relapse. And I don't want to explain that I have a terrible substance use problem to most people, so if I'm offered a drink, I just say no thanks politely and don't elaborate. If it was a joke, I'd like for them to explain where the comedy is in forcing someone to drink alcohol when they've said no multiple times. Disgusting behavior, and if your fianc\u00e9 is acting like this, PLEASE keep your eye out. He sounds nasty and hateful to his core, but he might be charming and funny on the surface. Just please be aware of his behaviors, this was a glaring red flag.", "NTA, you didn't overreact at all. In fact, you stayed longer than I would have and I come from an abusive family. \n\nYou will be TA to yourself, if you stay with this person. You've been with him for 3 years and this is the first time you were meeting his family. I can understand why, he thought he had you in the bag enough to show who he really is and that you will stay with him after. Don't let him gaslight you. \n\nIf you live together, pack his shit and tell him to stay at his horrible family's home, you will ship his crap to him.", "NTA -\n\nbut you should reconsider your boyfriend.\n\n1. He did not warn you, that the gathering would be anti-formal\n2. He found it funny to spike your drink, when he knew you wanted to keep being sober in order to drive back\n3. He found it funny, when his family insults you, in presence and now even via facebook\n4. ...  and more.\n\nI can not believe that you would enjoy being married to him.", "You are NTA but your BF is massive AH.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries and he mocked you for them with his family. Leave him. You can do better.", "NTA\u2026if he lives with you\u2026pack his shit and put it out.  Number one, you haven\u2019t met his family once in three years of dating?  Why?  What was his reasoning?  Two, he did not stand up for you and 3, he is agreeing with them.  You have seen his true colors.", "NTA. And it sounds like the relationship with the in-laws would be a rocky one if you marry into that family. Whether the fiancee is worth putting up with them is for you to decide.", "NTA at all. OP, you want to marry into this? I'd get out of this relationship ASAP. It's only going to get worse from here", "Did you mean to write ex-fiance?  I really hope so because you deserve so much better in a life partner.

I would ask yourself really seriously if you want to marry into this family. It\u2019ll only get worse. The biggest issue though is that your fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t stand up for you or try and get them to stop their behavior towards you (which was clearly making you uncomfortable). That\u2019s a huge red flag. What else in the future will he not stand up for you with his family? What about if/when you have kids? There\u2019s a million scenarios that could come up and he\u2019s shown you that as of right now he chooses his family over you.", "They sound trashy to be frank. Really weird you hadn't met them over the course of three years, but now you know why. Harder to run when you feel like you're on the hook. NTA and good luck with that circus", "NTA.  Are you sure you want to marry into this?  If he didn't stand up for you now, do you think he's going to later?", "NTA\n\nBut do you want to marry into this family?", "NTA I'm sorry you had to waste 3 years on this guy.", "NTA. Don't marry this man. There may be a reason why he waited so long for you to meet his family. They showed you who they are and he showed you that he will do NOTHING to defend or support you against their insults.", "Honey, run\u2026 don\u2019t ever let someone show you TWICE that they don\u2019t respect you and trust me when I tell you, the behavior your fianc\u00e9 showed is not a \u201cone time\u201d or \u201cwe were joking\u201d, they don\u2019t change or get better", "NTA. \n\nGet rid. You do not need someone who is going to treat you like that! How dare they behave that way to you and think that\u2019s acceptable. Please please rethink this - I know how hard that is but you deserve so much more.", "NTA. Get rid of the fianc\u00e9. He just showed you a glimpse into the future.", "Why are you still calling him your fianc\u00e9 dump him and his trashy family.", "NTA.  You and fianc\u00e9 are clearly on different pages in your relationship.  It is not uncommon for behavior to revert to juvenile antics when returning home.  Not an excuse, just an insight. But it is unfair that fianc\u00e9 not only didn\u2019t have your back but he also joined in attacking you.  If and when he returns you and he need to have a serious discussion about your boundaries and his, and whether the marriage can last.  From this hill where I personally would die, it looks like he set you up for ridicule, joined in attacking you (no it was not just teasing), and then tried to poison you with alcohol.  Lots to discuss.", "Definitely NTA. You saw his and his family's true colors. This is who he is and who they are. Do you still  want to marry this guy? I hope not, you deserve better.", "If someone shows you their true face, believe them. Don't make excuses for his behavior, don't try to find a flaw in yours. This was basically the ghost of Christmas future, this is how your life will be if you don't change something. Get out while you still can. NTA", "NTA don't marry this turd please", "NTA and I\u2019m not one to push for breaking up but in this case, you may want to. For the way he acted around his family and allowing the family to treat you in such a way, and joining in on it, is a giant red flag. For that is the way he, and them, will treat you for the rest of your life if you marry him. Any children you have will be treated the same way, or encouraged to bully you. It will not change.", "NTA. He set you up for failure. Also, go over the past three years. Has he belittled you in subtle ways?  He sounds dreadful.", "NTA. I'd have grabbed my stuff and kept driving. Run, OP.", "NTA. I was hopeful your fianc\u00e9 (ex) had \u201chidden\u201d his family from you for 3 years because he was embarrassed by their behavior. Unfortunately, he waited until you were \u201chooked\u201d (in love, engaged) to show you who he really is \u2014 he, sadly, is one of them. You deserve much better. Run!", "NTA.

He\u2019s met my family but I haven\u2019t met his until now.\n\nHe invited me to spent Christmas with his family this year.\n\nOn Christmas Day, I got ready. It wasn\u2019t anything overly fancy but I did my hair and make up, put on a nice dress that wasn\u2019t too formal and some nice shoes.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9, Greg, didn\u2019t say anything about that but I noticed that he didn\u2019t put a shirt or anything. He just had his favourite t-shirt on and some gym shorts. I figured he was going to change when we get there.\n\nI drove 2 hours to Slough to get to his family house.\n\nWhen we entered, I was eager to meet everyone and was surprised at the state of things. Half of the people there were in their pjs, some of which could use being washed, some were in their tracksuits and hoodies. I was surprised but I\u2019m not going to judge and I certainly am not going to comment on that, it\u2019s not my place. I just wished he warned me about the dress code.\n\nHis sister and cousins made fun of me dressing up formally. I joked along because what else was I supposed to do.\n\nI thought that was it but no. They were pushy with the food, getting offended when I wouldn\u2019t eat more than a small portion (I eat small portions anyway and the food was just dreadful). The women would make jokes about my look, criticise my life style and hobbies when I mentioned them. Kept asking about kids and telling me I\u2019m wasting my time working. The guys were crude and I was often the butt of their jokes. Worst part of it is that my fianc\u00e9 never defended me and laughed along.\n\nI tried to survive the dinner and get the fuck out of there but things turned when they wouldn\u2019t stop pushing me to have a drink. They just wouldn\u2019t let go even though I said that I was driving. The more drunk they got, the pushier they got. My fianc\u00e9 as well, I\u2019ve never seen him behave in such a way.\n\nWhen I came back from the loo and took a sip of my coke. Someone added alcohol to it, Sambuca, you could smell it a mile away. I spat it out and saw his cousins giggling.\n\nI asked what the fuck, they knew I was driving. My fianc\u00e9 defended them and said it was just a joke and to relax. I replied that I wasn\u2019t going to and I ignored everything but this was too much. He called me a stuck up and the loosen up at least once. He was dead serious.\n\nI grabbed my stuff, told him I\u2019m going home and that he won\u2019t have a ride home if he\u2019s not coming. He said \u201cwhatever\u201d and carried on talking.\n\nI left and drove back home. I\u2019m still angry and confused as to what happened. He\u2019s still not back and last I saw, he\u2019s posting stories after stories of their drunk antics. They haven\u2019t stopped parting since last night and even posted a photo of police at their house (no idea why).\n\n\nIn the mean time, his sister and cousins made all sorts of posts on Facebook about me. Tagging me in all of them, telling everyone what a stuck up,  snobby twat I am. \n\nI\u2019m starting to doubt myself. Did I overreact? Was I the asshole in this situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019d be thinking really hard about this relationship and if those are the kind of people I want in my life.", "NTA honestly op this is telling of what\u2019s to happen in the future and it\u2019s not going to get better. He is just like his family and I suggest you remove yourself before it\u2019s too late", "NTA. This is why he didn\u2019t introduce you sooner. These are his people and when with them, he shows you that he is exactly like them. Alcohol is not an excuse. He waited till he felt comfortable enough with you and your relationship that he thought showing you his true side wouldn\u2019t scare you off. \n\nDon\u2019t let him down play this. Don\u2019t let him blame it on the booze. That is who he is and remember if you stay with him, you also get his family as well.", "NTA. He's showing you exactly who he is, and who his family are. Your relationship is done. I'm afraid this isnt just some one-off thing, OP. You deserve better. Basic respect for your choices and standing up for you are the bare minimum, and he and his family won't even give you that.", "NTA. What a miserable night and horrible way to experience your fianc\u00e9. I\u2019ve likely seen his true colors. It may be time to end your engagement.", "No you didn't overreact you are marrying into a sloppy horrible family. Your finance is not going to defend you ever this day showed you what your future will be.", "When someone shows you who they are, believe them. This will only get much worse if you get married.", "Op, I get why your BF didn't introduce you to his family until now. Most women would have run had they met them after only 3 months. With 3 years having been invested in this relationship, you're more hesitant to break up. NTA", "There is a reason you haven\u2019t met them in three whole years. Upside: He has finally removed his mask. Proceed with informed caution. NTA.", "NTA. They spiked your drink when you were going to drive home - that puts you and other road users at risk, lives as well as you being caught and convicted of drink driving. And call that a joke?? Nope, nope, nope. Ditch him pronto.", "NTA and I would run from this shitshow. Including and especially the fiance.", "NTA \nNah ah, you can't marry that.", "There\u2019s a reason you live a 2 hour drive away and didn\u2019t meet them for 3 years. Facebook posts? Mocking others and spiking drinks? NTA, I\u2019m so sorry about your relationship", "NTA\nGirl, drop this man. You are out of his league", "NTA. If anything, if you don't dump him, then you're underreacting.", "NTA. Driving to Slough was the first red flag, I knew it was downhill from there.", "I think I get why she didn't meet them for three years.", "NTA. You have now seen who he really is and his family will come first always. Cut your losses", "NTA, you got a glimpse of who he really is. Do you really want in with this family? They sound terrible.", "ESH. You said some really judgy things and if we can believe what you said about them they are annoying too. \n\nYou were supposed to ask what to wear. \n\nIt's common for people to wear pajamas on Christmas. Many families take Xmas photos wearing pajamas and opening gifts in pajamas as the kids get up early to open gifts.", "[deleted]", "NTA. And just adding this because no one else has, John Betjeman\u2019s \u201cSlough\u201d: http://www-cdr.stanford.edu/intuition/Slough.html", "What kind of decent people post shitty things about you on Facebook when they\u2019ve just met you? AHs. \n\nNTA", "Spiking a drink isn't merely a prank. If someone did that to me or many of my friends it could lead to a devastating relapse into addiction. That ALONE would be worth throwing down about. NTA. These people suuuuuuuuuck.", "Adding: and seemed to be okay with the idea that his family wanted her to drive them home while drunk.", "I agree with everything you said, but for the record, spiking a drink is not a prank. It\u2019s a crime.", "Spiking a drink with anything, especially something that the person drinking the spiked beverage has refused multiple times at that point, isn\u2019t a prank. It\u2019s endangerment of their welfare", "That's not pranking, what if it was an alcohol that wasn't so obvious? \n\nWhat is she drove under the influence?", "She was so much nicer than I would have been about it. So much nicer", "Damn I\u2019m really sorry. I really feel like your fiance needs to cut his ties with them and marry you, or you end the engagement and move on. I doubt he will leave his family but you should give him the option. My dad cut ties with his family for a variety of reasons but mostly because his family damaged his marriage to my mom. He is happier now too. They dragged him down. Sounds like your fiance reverts back to these old ways when he\u2019s around them but he clearly has \u201cchanged\u201d since he\u2019s dif with you?? Gotta grow up and cut the cord. These people will make your life miserable. They will never suddenly decide to treat you with more respect.", "I literally could not agree more. I\u2019m so sorry op. Good luck.", "Agree.  Give new meaning to Boxing Day.  Whatever he has at your place should be boxed or placed in trash bags and set outside.  Get new locks for the doors.  Block him on all media.  Get that trash out of your life and move on.", "NTA. Run run run run RUNNNNNNNNNNNN. If you marry him, that awful family becomes your awful family.", "This is clearly why he didn't introduce her to them. He knew she would leave right away but he hoped she would be too in love. \n\nOP, you need to break up with him. This is what your future holds.", "You got engaged to this guy having never met his family? Lesson learned. Please, cut your losses. Looks like he was trying to \"marry up\", but would have just dragged you down.", "Oh, you missed the most egregious thing on the bf\u2019s part - he told her it was a \u201cjoke\u201d and she should \u201crelax\u201d. That\u2019s so dismissive of OP\u2019s very valid feelings and I\u2019m *enraged* at him on her behalf.", "Imagine if this is the family putting their best foot forward too. It's only going to go downhill from here.", "Yes. Do not marry this man. This is a glimpse of your potential future", "Yes, I was surprised that this post didn't start with ex-fiance.", "Girl, do you want to marry into the Shameless-family? I\u2019d dump him and never look back.\n\nSlough out of all fucking places *shudder*", "There's much more at stake than just ruined holidays...", "Yes, this is often a knee-jerk with this sub but in this case, it sounds sensible. Your fianc\u00e9 became a different person within his family home. If he\u2019s going to carry on seeing them, it sounds like you two just aren\u2019t compatible and will have an unhappy marriage. (Unless of course you\u2019re happy to stay somewhere else and he\u2019s happy to go to theirs alone?)", "Dude was rude as fuck for not telling her about the dressed down Christmas to begin wirh6", "100% agree!", "I don't think she was judging them for being in their PJs, rather mentioning it because it would have made sense for her fiance to mention that no one else would be dressed up, and allowing her to dress properly for the occasion by changing into something more comfortable. If she's been properly advised, OP probably would've worn PJs as well!", "To be honest, we all judged people in our minds at one time or another. It doesn\u2019t make us assholes. It makes as human. It\u2019s when the thoughts affect our actions or we vocalise them, that\u2019s when we become assholes. \n\nSo even without spiking the drink, as long as she never said anything or acted upon it, she wouldn\u2019t be an asshole.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

In three years she never picked up on the fact that his background was wildly different from hers? Either he\u2019s a very convincing liar or she is dense.", "Christmas morning, sure, Christmas dinner with guests coming from all over, not so much, and if that\u2019s the dress code, you should let people know.", "Um what?? Or their partner could've seen them over dressing and warned them?? I'm trying to see where op said anything judgy?  How are they supposed to ask what to wear if they never met the family, never seen them celebrate a damn holiday?? \n\nIt's common to wear PJs at Christmas what's not common is letting your partner get all dolled up and bullied by your family for it and getting harassed over your hobbies, job , etc and joining in on it.", "How was op ah? You didn\u2019t explain", "Agreed!  It's terrible!", "NTA. They were disrespecting your boundaries and your bf has now shown his true colors in front of you.", "Yeah, poor word choice.  You are correct.", "Yeah, please read my other responses to this.  I made a list and for brevity's sake used the word, \"prank,\" though I agree, it is much worse than that.", "Same. I'm sorry OP. This is the best summary though. \n\nCould you imagine them as your in-laws for years?", "this is the absolute right answer.    \nBut i'm sure if OP looked back, she'd find other warning signs.", "Yeah that\u2019s all I could think of too. Bunch of chavs", "The Britwell?", "It was intentional.  He set her up to be the butt of his family's harassment.     \n\n\nOP you are NTA.     And if you are smart, this fella is your EX-fiance.", "It sounds like the \"dress code\" was \"come in whatever you want\"", "I'd say the dress code was come in whatever you want, so fiancee just figured that's what she wanted to wear.", "[deleted]", "I highly doubt that though, if fiancee would've told op it wasn't a dress up event they wouldn't have been so 'over dressed' and made fun of for it. It seems like fiancee knew what they were doing and just wanted to join in on bullying op", "How is not accepting bigger portions when you normal eat small portions showing disgust? Getting food and then barely touching it would be showing disgust. Also op doesn\u2019t have to like their food.\n\nI didn\u2019t see op point out there were above but instead was just describing how they dressed and were acting.", "[deleted]", "Okay and not everyone going to like someone food. I didn\u2019t read anywhere that she told someone that. \n\nAlso the fiance is the one to blame on the attire. He didn\u2019t tell her anything. He probably knew they were gonna act that way. Also its a them problem if they got issues with someone being dressed nicer than them. Especially if they have to be a bully to make themselves feel better. \n\nPlus op was who drove so she should have given the option for him to join her or not.", "Unless she actually told them \"I can't eat more because this food is disgusting\" she's allowed to have an inner monologue of her own opinion. And to top it all off they spiked her drink. In comparison to not liking food and wearing non pajamas there is no competition. Spiking someone's drink is so much worse it kept her completely clear of AH territory."]}
