And does it need to be done together? I mean it's cute I guess that you guys used to cook together but to me that actually seems like more trouble than it is worth.  If I'm responsible for dinner...I'd rather have my wife out of the kitchen so that I can do my thing and when she cooks it is the same.  Why not just take turns every other day or something?  \n\nPersonally I don't need a \"warm/cooked\" meal every day for dinner.  If you feel like it is too much work and she's not helping...then make it easier.  Dinner tonight is a baguette with some sliced ham, cheese, and salami.  Takes 3 minutes to prepare and still tastes good.", "Cooking is a pain in the ass. If it was up to me, I would just eat a sandwich or something that's easy to make.  Now that I am married to my wife, she expects a plate of food and the only reason why I agreed is because we split the cooking task. half of the week she cooks and the other half I cook. Whoever cooks does the dishes. That is just how we do it and I think it's fair.  I would not indulge a person who does not do his\\\\her part.  \n\nSo, in short if my wife did wat your partner did, I would say fine. I will grab myself a sandwich or whatever and you do you.   I think she is taking advantage of you. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  So your GF just wants you to do the lot?  Nah mate.  It doesn't work like that.

She can't just conveniently choose when she feels like doing chores", "NTA if she isn\u2019t cooking she can clean up!", "There are companies that do prepared meal delivery.

This sounds a lot like she is pregnant to me.", "NTA\u2026.you cook or you clean or you both do both together. That\u2019s just common courtesy.  Unless you dirty everything under the sun to give her more work you are NTA\u2026..partners mean 50/50 in the relationship but sometimes 100/0 you cook 0% of the time you clean 100% of the time.
