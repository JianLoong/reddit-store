You can still dress nice, *if you want to* and still dress comfortably *if you want to*. Buying you a whole new wardrobe is a nice gesture but it's completely soiled by their reasoning behind it, which is selfish, conceded and frankly pretty foul. Throwing out your old clothes without your consent is a huge step too far. I've honestly not read anything like this before. If you were going out to places with them and dressing inappropriately, like fancy evening meals and you're in a tracksuit and they're black tie, I could understand them maybe trying to be nice and spoiling you with a few nice outfits, but completely binning and replacing your wardrobe so you meet their standards 24/7? And your husband is in on it? I just cannot comprehend it", "ESH. his SIL didn\u2019t deserve to be yelled at, so just a soft YTA for you. Your husband is an AH bc it sounds like he feels a sense of ownership over you.", "ESH", "The whole sister in law thing pales into insignificance when I read that your husband bought you new clothes to \"fit in with his family\".

Do you have rights or a you just happy playing little babydoll? \n1) buy your own stuff or these things are gifts.\n2) don\u2019t let anyone into your closet.

What a weird and controlling thing to do! What if you wanted to give that to someone? What if the new clothes just don't feel as comfortable to wear around the house or sleep in?  Also, some older clothes are great to have around for general mess work you may have to do. Can't paint or garden in new fancy outfits. I'd let them both have it and let them know under no circumstance are they ever allowed to take or get rid of your personal things again.\n\nSIL isn't as much of an AH as your husband, but she should have known better than to do as he asked without checking with your first.", "I am going NTA. These things belong to you. No one can throw them away.\nInfo: why do you buy a new wardrobe? How can they force you to buy new stuff and wear that only?

You don\u2019t know what your husband told his sister.  How old is the sister? I\u2019m assuming young since she is naive and just did what she was told.
