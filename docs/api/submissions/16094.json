She always makes everything about herself. My response is, \u201cwhatever.\u201d \n\nNTA congratulations on the new addition.  Hope you can find healing peace over the next few weeks. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. You need to take care of yourself and your baby. And you even went as far as setting up reasonable accommodations for your mom that she doesn\u2019t even have to pay for. Congratulations on your new addition and I hope the two of you a speedy recovery:)", " NTA - It is extremely reasonable for you to not want to have a guest after a traumatic birth", "NTA - just the fact that you\u2019re even thinking about this right now is too much for you to worry about. Save it for another day when you are rested and healed. There may be plenty of issues that come up over the next weeks and months and I hope that it gets easier to let it slide off your back. If you need to address it now, you can say something along the lines of \u201cI understand your feelings but I\u2019m recovering right now. When we\u2019re both ready we can talk about it more later.\u201d In the meantime, enjoy your new baby. Congratulations, and don\u2019t forget to take care of yourself in the midst of taking care of the little one!", "NTA. You have every right to set boundaries, and she's not entitled to stay with you just because she wants to.   She sounds manipulative.", "NTA. This is totally something my mother would do too. I\u2019ve learned to set really strict boundaries with her. All the best for your recovery and your family - you deserve all the time for space and healing!", "NTA. Your mom is trying to guilt you into letting her stay. Don't please. You need to de-stress after a birth and your mom visiting you will help do the opposite of de-stressing.", "NTA. \n\nSimilar thing happen to my late wife.  You need your time and not to \u201centertain\u201d anyone after a horrible experience like that. Sure, she would be there to help, but most guest expect a certain amount of attention that you should NOT be worrying about at this time.", "NTA. 9 to 9 are very generous visiting hours and giving her a whole house to herself is very gracious. Your mom should be putting your comfort and feelings first at this time instead of making it all about herself when you need to rest and heal. Maybe flying home is the best thing for all. Too bad she has already caused you upset and grief.", "NTA it sounded like she wanted to \"hlep\", which is when someone acts/appears to help but mostly ends up hogging the baby and ordering the new parents around. She claimed this is a \"visit\" which puts pressure on you as the \"hosts\"; no post-birth, especially post-traumatic-birth, parent needs that.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry to hear about your birth experience and glad to hear you\u2019re doing better. The time at home after the birth of your child is sacred. You get to choose who visits and when they visit. You told your mother when she could visit, and when she didn\u2019t like the answer, she threw a tantrum. Good for you for standing your ground and communicating what you needed!", "NTA.  Tell your mom you aren\u2019t disrespecting her but that you are creating space for healing. She sounds JUST like my mom who would have slept in my bed had I not explained my husband would be in the bed!  She suggested the couch - I said no to that because either myself or my husband may need it through the night.  Remind her you want private time with husband and baby and the offer of staying at a free place instead of a hotel is generous.\n\nRemind her if she leaves, that\u2019s her choice.", "NTA - she invited herself, which is reason enough. Let her fly herself home, you offered her a place to stay rather than forcing her to pay for a hotel, which is exactly what I\u2019d do.", "NTA \u2014 I\u2019ve had three C-sections, with the first one happening unexpectedly after a failed birth center stay. It took me several months to come to peace with my unfulfilled birth plan. \n\nWishing you and your baby a smooth recovery.", "op=NTA\n\nYou offered her somewhere to stay.  She's just trying to guilt you.\n\nCongratulations on New Baby and stand firm. (or lay down firm).", "NTA. Your mother is never entitled to stay in your home without being invited to do so. It sounds like her tantrum/storming off to the airport is a godsend for you. Hope your recovery is swift!", ">She told me I hurt her and that I wasn't raised this way.\n\nMy dad always pulled the you weren't raised this way garbage with me. Like how would he know. I hate that crap. OP, please do me a favor and put your mom out of your mind for the next two months. You are in a really tough place right, medically and as a new mom, you don't have the spoons for her right now. \n\nFocus on healing. Focus on your kid. Focus on being a team with your husband. Your mom can come up again when you have the air to breathe. NTA.", "just wondering, how did you get this far without any kind of discussion? like if a parent is flying out to see you, isnt there usually some kind of discussion on where they\u2019ll be staying? she just flew up on her own and decided shes staying with you?
