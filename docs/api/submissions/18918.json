The smell of garlic makes me incredibly sick. My husband knows this and has been very kind by not having any sort of garlic smells in our house. He has also told me it\u2019s ok to leave parties or restaurants if I feel too sick from the smell but the thing is I hate pulling the \u201cI\u2019m pregnant so I can do whatever I want\u201d card so I\u2019ve been sucking it up and that\u2019s gone well.\n\nWell we went to a new restaurant to celebrate his brothers engagement last night and once we got there I panicked because I watched garlic bread being served at tables. He noticed and whispered that he could drive me home and then come back and have dinner with his family. I felt awful but that night it was bad and I knew I might end up sick if I tried to stay which would put a damper on the night so I told him yes please. However, his brother saw us and motioned for us to join them at the table. We walked up to them and my husband simply said to the group I wasn\u2019t feeling well from the garlic smell in the restaurant so he was going to drop me off at home and then come back. \n\nHis brother looked upset and begged for both of us to stay because this night was important and swore I would be ok. I listened and convinced my husband I could stay. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later it got bad and I excused myself to the bathroom and everyone knew why. When I returned I saw my husband had gathered my things and his brother and FSIL looked pissed off. \n\nWe left and I went to bed, but today I got a text from his brother saying that I shouldn\u2019t have come if I knew I was going to do this and FSIL is upset because for the rest of the night she could tell everyone was thinking about me. Apparently my MIL also spent the night talking about her pregnancies with her kids. \n\nI feel like I should have had more of a backbone and told them no I couldn\u2019t stay because now I hurt them and we learned from a cousin they may take away my invitation to the wedding because I\u2019ll be 7 months then and may make another scene. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685835003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ztlzx/aita_for_ruining_an_engagement_dinner/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
