He should have notified you well in advance (and it would have still been perfectly legitimate for you to deny the request at that point).", "NTA", "NTA you had no idea, but it might be beneficial to bite the bullet and come to some sort of an agreement about paying PART of the fee back, or he might get petty.", "NTA - It is your spot, not the landlord's since he rented it to you.  His tough luck he got caught in his awful sense of entitlement.  Must suck to be him.", "NTA. Like it\u2019s so difficult to leave a note on his car to call if you needed to get out?", "Fuck that parasite", "This. You\u2019re totally in the right OP and shouldn\u2019t pay the tow fee, but if you don\u2019t how much will it cost you long term?", "You can\u2019t legally get evicted unless you\u2019re on a month to month lease in this case. Then they can give you a 30 day to move out. And even if the OP doesn\u2019t move out after the notice, then the landlord would have to go through a whole eviction process. It\u2019s not that easy to just kick someone out.", "It\u2019s easy to not renew a lease. It\u2019s easy to slow roll request.", "No but when renewal time rolls around and the rent doubles you don't need to to wonder why", "Obviously. a month before a lease ends, either side has an option to give notice.", "It all depends on where they live and what the terms of the lease are. You do understand that every time a tenant moves out, unless they\u2019re in a high demand area, it costs the landlord money and time,  right? Rent loss due to vacancy, cleaning and getting the unit ready, advertising for the unit, time showing the unit, etc. if OP is a great tenant, the landlord has more reason to keep them than to not.", "Ya, I get how rental properties work. \n\nOp started this is a big city and parking is limited so the ground floor of a multi unit apartment with exclusive garage access is highly desirable. Whatever terms are in the lease aside, expect the maximum rent increase.", "The landlord will have to weigh the pros and the cons. I own properties, and I personally wouldn\u2019t raise the rent significantly just to get the OP out if they always paid on time and is otherwise a great tenant over $400 to get my car back.  Either way, the OP is NTA.", "You do understand rent control doesn't mean no rent increase it just means they increase amount is capped by regulations. My previous comment stands, expect the maximum increase.", "I understand rent control very well. Again, pros and cons that the landlord will have to figure out. If it\u2019s too much, the OP can just move. That\u2019s the beauty of renting, flexibility.", "So you are arguing that an area with rent control could have too many cons for the landlord?  Wouldn't the mere fact the area is rent control mean it is in high demand?", "Even if there\u2019s a high demand, there\u2019s still time and money that that the landlord is wasting. Like I said, that\u2019s up to them to decide. There\u2019s too many unknown facts. We\u2019re all just speculating. Lol chill, ain\u2019t no one arguing with you \ud83d\ude02", "Nta", "NTA. He'd have had *your* car towed had *you* parked somewhere you shouldn't have...however as these other folks have said, be ready for retaliation of some sort and/or start finding a new place to live. He can't legally evict you for this but he can make your life a living hell.", "No, you're not that asshole. Your landlord was thoughtless and should have asked to use the driveway you're paying for.

However, I will note that making an enemy of your landlord is often not a good idea. It may be worth paying part of the fee as a peace offering on the condition he never does that again without notice on pain of being towed to keep the peace. It was his fuck up, but his fuck up could easily lead to fucking you up if he's a dick about it. Unless you live in a state/area with serious renter protection and are willing to deal with him hating you, in which case carry on good sir XD", "NTA\n\nHe could have found street parking elsewhere and walked his lazy ass to the building.", "Yeah...it's like, you're NTA but how you respond should be made after careful reflection of how much you value your current living situation and the perks it offers, because there's a lot of ways the landlord could make your living situation a lot less comfy that would be hard to prove as retaliation, and he likely doesn't have to have a specific reason to not offer you a lease renewal."]}
