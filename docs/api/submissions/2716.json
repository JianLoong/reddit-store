She obviously won't care.\n\nThen, go to HR and to your manager. Tell them this has been going on for X months, that you cannot do your work because of this, and you ended up wearing earplugs to work because of her (which is a bit offensive to the rest of your coworkers - it is, a little bit). Tell them you tried taking to her, but she doesn't care. Show them the written proof. \n\nThis is a problem for the HR and the bosses to solve. \n\nAsk your coworkers to back you up.

Expecting colleagues to email you from across the floor is a bit much, but I can see you\u2019re a bit stuck because of the noisy co-worker.

The others knew why and understood. It connected to his phone so they could text or instant messages him in teams. The music was peaceful. Once she left he stopped wearing them.

I also tend to speak too loudly because of my hearing loss. Its not right to yell like that at work on personal calls when it disrupts other people. She has ignored your requests to keep it down.

The best cancelling is ear plugs + noise cancelling headphones playing something, whether music or white noise track. The Sony WH headphones are really comfortable.", "This is bad legal advice at least for the US.  US laws on recordings like this don't necessarily turn on expectations of privacy.
