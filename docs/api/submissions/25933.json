Make new friends. Find open minded people who are accepting of you, and not people who are actively trying to fix you.", "NTA. They're not looking to help you, they're looking for you to validate their beliefs by joining their cult.", "NTA\n\nFundamentalists make bad friends, they orey on the weak and wounded. Being a missionary is unfortunately part of this religion, up to the point of the missionary getting a place in heaven when they convert someone. So in a way, what they do is just selfish. \n\nI unfortunateky think you need new friends. These guys are lost in their religion, which they will place above you at all times.", "NTA.\n\nReligious zealots are disliked for the simple reason they almost never practice what they preach. I want to believe Christians preach from a place of wanting to help others, but the amount of judgement, condescension, sanctomony, and utter hypocrisy they spout it with makes me think it's all just narcissism and arrogance. They just like getting high on themselves telling others how to live.\n\nI'd give them an ultimatum: either they follow the good book (thou shalt not judge) and accept you the way you are, or you're finding people who will. People constantly running you down and telling you what you need to do is a just a toxic environment you don't need or deserve.", "NTA\n\nThey aren't your friends, you're *their* pet project.", "NTA \n\nStop giving them access to you. Regardless of your mh, you laid down a boundary and they stomped all over it. The fact that it exacerbates your depression makes their behavior so much worse. They'd rather be holier than thou and play their judgement game than actually care about how you are doing. \n\nAnd, tbh, I don't think they are doing it out of friendship or a place of love. They're doing it from a place of judgement. Where they feel they are better than you. Happier. More successful. Better loved. And rather than simply being grateful they turn their joy into an outwards facing weapon that they use to attack others. Because what you describe is absolutely an attack. And an attack of lies at that. Because nothing in your life will magically be perfect the moment you believe. In fact, their lives aren't perfect. If they were these people wouldn't need to harass you for validation.\n\nSo I would end the friendship. You can tell them why or you can quietly disappear. \"Constantly belittling my choices because they don't line up with your ideology is not friendship. It's not even kind. And it certainly isn't Christian.\" is likely what I'd say.", "NTA - they are vultures and circling. I am an atheist but some of my closest friends are thumpers - it works because _we've had that conversation_ and it's done. With one we've even joked that if he's right and I'm wrong, I'm taking his house and computers after the rapture and I'll be sure to feed his dog.\n\nMaybe set some thresholds and boundaries? Warn them in no uncertain terms that you will go NC as soon as they start pulling this. Get up and walk away in the middle of a conversation and tell them on the way out that if they _ever_ respected you to contact you in a week or something. After that week, if it still happens, sorry, but they can't compartmentalize enough.", "NTA, explain to them that if they want to remain your friend they should respect your wishes and stop pushing their religion on you. If they won't I'm sorry to say that cutting ties might be the only option. This is about your well being and having to listen to them about this all the time is actually abuse and borders in cult behaviour. Try to stay respectful to the person, but the ideology is fair game. Point out the flaws and contradictions the bible and explain that you are not convinced. Personally I really like Seth Andrews/the thinking Atheist. Maybe look him up on YouTube. He's is an ex Christian and what I love about his way of doing things is that he always stays respectful of the person. Hope you'll figure out your best way of dealing with this.", "NTA.\n\nAre they really your friends if it's gotten to the point where you want to cut off contact and they disregard your feelings?\n\nIt's out of love for themselves that they want to *save* you because in their eyes that's a guaranteed entrance ticket into to heaven for themselves.", "NTA\n\nThis is exactly why most atheists (probably others religions, too) can't stand Christians.  No one likes religion forced down their throat.  These types of Christians don't get that.  They think they're \"saving\" you and have no concept of the idea that some don't actually want to be \"saved.\"\n\nIf they are actually your friends, they would respect that you rejected their attempts to save you and leave that alone about it.  Anyone who can't respect your boundaries is not your friend.", "OP, they are not your friends. You are a potential soul to save for them. There are practicing Christians and there are preaching ones. The preaching ones are predatory and manipulative.\n\nIn India for example, they will get really poor hindus jobs and then after 3-5 months when they are used to a steady income, they will threaten to fire them if they don't convert. They will go to poor people, tell them that they will teach their kids for free in convents- as long as they get to keep the kids in residential schools where they do exactly what they did to natives in NA. Yes, in 2023!\n\nThey frequently approach patients that are dying with cancer and tell them their family members got cancer because it is a punishment from god cause they worship wrong god.\n\nChristianity is just a cult that became really successful. At its core, it remains a cult though. They want more members who will spend tithe to the church. You are not their friend, you are potential prey. Get rid of them, your life will be better for it. Seek out new friends.", "NTA...and I promise you not all Christians are AH. I very much follow the religion and don't try to turn my friends who aren't and \"save their souls\" I let it be known what I believe and that's that. If they want to talk to me about it ok. I don't bother them about my beliefs and expect the same from them about not pushing their disbelief on me. It's frankly only right.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t respecting your boundaries and that is actively making the friendship toxic. They just sound exhausting. It\u2019d make my depression worse if my friends were like this.\n\nFWIW, it\u2019s possible to be close with strong believers and have them respect boundaries. These friends just aren\u2019t like that, or haven\u2019t learned that yet. You could try resetting your boundaries - being extremely clear with them that their proselytizing is having the opposite effect of what they\u2019re striving for, and it\u2019s making you want to be around them less. Then, and this is crucial, be around them less when they continue. It\u2019s a rude comparison, but think about how you teach an animal \u2018No\u2019, you have to both say it clearly and couple it with an action (usually a hand held up) to get the point across.", "These people are not your friends. They are overly religious around you and have some savior complex. If they cannot listen to you without bring religion into it, they are not your people. I\u2019d personally cut contact over this, especially since they abuse your mental health as a \u201cSATAN!!!\u201d thing. Be kind to yourself and I hope you\u2019ll feel better.", "Truthfully, most chridtians I have known are much like your triends... they keep pushing their beliefs on others. they may believe it is the right thing to do... and refuse to stop. My experience hss made me rather wary of having frirnds who are religious. The only way to get your friends to stop are to either convert to their religion, or stop being friends with them. NTA thouhh. You have every right to get fed up with them... just realize that they are very unlikely to ever stop.", "So then stop being friends with them its not hard", "NTA as a Christian, a true lover of Jesus would respect your views and leave you alone. Jesus loved everyone, even non-believers, he didn't try to convert, he didn't force, annoy, harass, or hate anyone who didn't listen to him. Why can't people be like him and do the same? Everyone has a path in life, whether that be with God, with no one, with even Satan, everyone makes a choice. It is not up to us to save people, people should want to do that for themselves. A true Christian lets people exercise their own agency. People forget that and that is why Christianity is falling by the wayside.", "\"Religion is like a pen\\*s. Nice to have one but please don't shove it down the throat of people unconsented.\"\n\nI would have been fed up already. And since I tend to do the exact opposite of what people to convince me to do I probably would show up with pentagram necklaces and turned crosses all over just to make a point. Yes, it's seems petty and childish but some people can't accept a simple \"no, thanks\" and need some more visual feedback. (Please don't tell me this would be rude - it's rude to force ones own religious beliefs onto another person when they've asked to stop several times.)\n\nSo definetely NTA and take care of yourself. It's not worthy to keep friendships for the sake of \"good old times\" when it's making you feel worse and especially make your therapy efforts harder.", "NTA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReligion should be treated like a penis:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's fine to have one, and it's totally fine to be really happy with and proud of it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut don't wave it around in public and don't ram it down people's throats unasked", "As a Christian, NTA. Your friends need to stop. Zealots/fundamentalists interpreting Christianity to such an extent cause everyone issues", "ESH\n\nThem, obviously.

Since 19 I've been with my bf and lived with him. I grew in an orphanage that was christian themed though they respected some kids not wanting that. But it made me grow up around and have a lot of christian friends. Everything was like any other friendships with none religious friends until they started developing a mindset that i need to be saved at all costs. Which yes, they do it out of worries and love to some degree, but it became very inapropriate very quickly in my eyes.\n\nI must clarify that I have suffered from depression of which i am aware of and activly working against since im 16. Im pretty sure everyone who goes through that knows that its up and down and well i havent gotten rid of it. Currently its a pretty low time for me and that might have made me oversensitive.\n\nSo for about a year and half those friends have started to jump on any chance that they get to remind me of my issues and that \"Im clearly unwell\", no **** sherlock. Im not mad about the fact that they share the gosspel, they religion in a way demands it and its the right thing to do in their eyes, but I asked them politly to stop it, Im atheist and will keep this way, but they ignored that. I am frustrated about the fact that I can not be with my friends because they will tell me how much better I would be with christian husband, how much better i would be with faith, how \"perfect\" I would be... And it is wearing me down. I can not be vonourable because they will use that against me. I am so tired of it and yesterday I tried to make clear that they make me feel misserable by their endless and unfilltered parading, the only thing i got told was, \"the devil is trying to keep you from god\" and they didnt stop. \n\nI am questioning how carring a friendship is that having mental breakdowns \"its the best for me\". \n\nI tolled my friends to stop with their parading towards me because i dont think I can take that anymore.\n\nBefore anyone feels attacked, Im not critizicing christians, im just done with my friends. I feel like they went to far and for my sake I had to put up a surtain defense.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
