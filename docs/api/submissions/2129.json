Invitations have long been sent out. My cousin (41f) RSVP'd that she would be there with her three children (20m, 18f, 16m) and her boyfriend (47m).\n\nI grew up around my cousin (she was a teenager when I was born so she was my number one babysitter growing up). There was a time when I was younger that we were close, but as I grew and moved away to college, that relationship has faded and we really only ever see each other during holidays now. \n\nI have never met her boyfriend. They met online. He lives in Las Vegas and she lives in Tallahassee with her boys (her daughter is attending college in South Florida). I know they have been together for more than a year But because we have never met him, my fiance and I decided we did not want him at our wedding.\n\nYesterday I called my cousin to speak with her about our concerns. As you may imagine, the phone call did not go well. She said he had already bought his plane ticket and she had already bought her dress. She was bawling by the end of it and asked if there was anything she could do that would change my mind. I stood fast.\n\nBecause we decided to get married on New Year's Eve, this is quite possibly the last time all three of her children will be together for this particular holiday. It's not that I don't want my cousin to be at my wedding, I just don't want her to bring her online boyfriend. She says they are spending the rest of their lives together and that he is her other half, But why would I want to have a complete stranger at my wedding?\n\nAITA for asking her to make a decision between spending the holiday with all of our family at my wedding and the man she says wants to spend the rest of her life with?", "created_utc": 1668259233, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt6w6o/aita_for_disinviting_my_cousin_to_my_wedding/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And they are likely to be people you have never met before.\n\nIt just seems really arbitrary and cruel to tell your cousin she can't come if she shows up with her boyfriend.  It's not like he's going to ruin the ceremony.  Seeing as it's not his family, he is likely to be one of the best behaved guests!!!", "More info needed - did you send out formal invites that allowed for a plus one? On what basis did the boyfriend buy his ticket? Also, how many people are invited to the wedding?", "INFO: was the invitation for her only or did it mention the possibility of a +1?\nWere her kids mentioned in the invitation as the only people she could bring?", "Ordinarily I would go with something else, but YTA. It's not like you know the guy and have a reason to have done this to your cousin. You don't know him at all. It IS your wedding, yes. And you have final say in the guest list. But handling this the way you did because of a complete unknown is asshole material.\n\nDo you know her children? Would you have told her to leave one of her kids behind if you didn't, because \"who knows what that kid is like?\" She was coming to your wedding and hoping to introduce you and the rest of your family to the person who makes her happy, and now, you've given her an impossible dilemma.", "YTA stop telling people she didn't have a +1 when you said in the comments it was her + Family. As if the man she was planning on spending her life with, wasn't family. You knew she wanted to bring him from the very beginning & even had chances to make it clear before tickets were bought & arrangements were made. The truth is you don't respect her relationship because it's not like yours.", "In your comments you said that you knew she wanted to bring her boyfriend even before sending invitations, yet you didn't specify people by name on her. You send for \"her and her family\". Really, one quick phone call after sending her invitation could save you all that problem. And yes, we could argue that she's the one that misunderstood, that that's not your fault, but! \n\n> I am not judging her for being in an online relationship.\n\n> I just don't want her to bring her online boyfriend.\n\nI don't know, you sound pretty judgemental. And he's not \"online\"  boyfriend, they met irl multiple, they're flying to each other. He makes her happy and she even said, that she wants to spend the rest of her life with him. That's serious relationship, even if long distance one.\n\nYou are judging her relationship and belittling it.\n\nReading your post and comments, for me you come out as really fake person - firstly you emphasize how much you care about her, how important she is to you, yet you're denying her +1 on your wedding. It would be different if it was really small wedding, but you have no problem with inviting 3 of her children.\n\nYou don't care for her as much as you say and you are thinking less of her relationship. You sound as an a-hole, and you are one. YTA", "you can invite whoever you want but one extra doesn't destroy your whole wedding.\n\nmy cousin was with her boyfriend for few months . My grandpa died and her brother refused to invite her bf to the furneral . There was enough food for him he would not bother anyone . They got married and it had been a nice gesture to welcome him into the family. You can believe that he remembered being excluded .\n\nDo whatever you want but as long it doesn't break your bank include the partner. Esp. for weddings it is about relationships so why would you exclude someones partner ? You don't need to interact with him but he is part of her life. And if you didn't want her to come with a partner you should specify it in the invitation or beforehand .\n\nI don't understand ppl who refuse to include the partner . I mean unless the person caused drama in the family and is toxic or dangerous . But you want her to watch all the happy couples around her and be alone.\n\nWho goes alone to a wedding when he has a partner ? Weddings normally suck for singles", "YTA\n\nNot because you chose to have your wedding on NYE, of course there will be people who can't make it (an invitation is not a summons) but...... Who are you to judge someone else's relationship status? Especially at an event celebrating relationships?\n\nAlthough one could argue that the cousin is an AH for adding invitees, but you started it by ignoring other people's relationship statuses", "YTA. You invited her 'and family'. That includes him; he is her partner. \n\nIf you didn't want to invite him you could have made this clear by only writing her and her children's names on the invite. You did not do this so of course she assumed, not unreasonably, that this would include her partner of one year.\n\nIf she has any sense she won't go to your wedding. I wouldn't; you want me to miss new year's eve celebrations and ditch my partner for a wedding? Not a chance in hell.", "YTA.  You sent the invitation out to \"family\"  and then backtracked.   You're not going to even notice him at your wedding.   You're making a family member choose between you and her own family.   You're judging her relationship and being condescending about it.

It\u2019s your wedding and you can invite who you want, but you clearly knew she wanted him to come and left the invitation vague by just saying and family instead of listing individuals.  I took my now spouse, who I met online and was long distance with, though not as long distance as your cousin, to a family wedding on our third date and there really wasn\u2019t anything awkward about it from anyone involved.  I get your having a medium to small sized wedding, but you\u2019re greatly overestimating how much time you\u2019re going to be spending with anyone but the wedding party.  At the family wedding we went to, we probably spent 15-20 minutes, if that, with the bride and groom.  At our own, we spent a very limited time with any guests at the actual wedding and it just increased if people stayed long.  I think you\u2019re overestimating how awkward this will get", "YTA you are close to your cousin and I bet everyone is allowed a plus one correct?  You tell her she can\u2019t bring her boyfriend?

Who cares she is your family.", "YTA\n\nWho arranges a wedding on the new year's eve and prevents a guest from being with their partner?", "YTA. \n\nThis guy cares about your cousin enough to go to an event on a holiday that will be crawling with her family, immediate and extended, where he\u2019ll have to meet and make nice with them. PLUS he\u2019s bought a plain ticket for this. That alone tells me he\u2019s not just her \u201conline boyfriend\u201d, he\u2019s her partner. Who cares how they met. It\u2019s 2022, online dating might be exhausting, but it\u2019s not weird or taboo anymore.", "INFO how was the invitation addressed? Was it to your cousin only? What is the plus one situation for your other guests?", "INFO: how was the invitation addressed? Was it written in a way that she was offered a plus one or was it too vague to know?", "Surely it's fairly normal for at least some strangers to be at a wedding if you're providing plus ones. Unless every friend and family member has been in a relationship for long enough that you've met every spouse, it seems hard to imagine. \n\nThe key is the plus one situation. If she got one then she's entitled to use it.", "INFO: is your only issue the fact that he\u2019s a stranger to you? if you had met her bf, would that change anything? did she get a +1 on her invite or did she assume she could bring her anyway because they\u2019re dating?", "YTA because you knew she wanted to bring her boyfriend but you worded the invitation vaguely. Instead of \u201cand family\u201d, you should have listed the people invited BY NAME in this situation.", "YTA.  Your lack of grace will cripple your future.", "Did her invitation say plus one, or plus one and children? If it did, you don't get to dictate who her plus one is, unless it is someone you have a bad history with, which is clearly not the case here, you need to suck it up. \n\nIf you issued plus one invite, YTA. If not she's overstepping.", "What did the invitation say?  Was it addressed to her, or to her and her kids, or to her and her kids +1 guest?  It matters.  If the invitation was just to her then she should not have invited her kids and her boyfriend without asking you first.", "YTA\u2026 I get it\u2019s your wedding but IF there was a plus one on invite who cares if she brings her boyfriend? Just because she met him \u201conline\u201d doesn\u2019t make him a creep. I\u2019ve seen plenty of successful relationships that start online. I think if it was more of a financial problem for you to have someone you don\u2019t know and pay for food for plus ones then that would be different, sounds kind of like you\u2019re just being judgmental\u2026", "YTA you only aren't inviting him because they met online? It's rude to invite someone with a long term partner but not their partner.\nIt's your wedding invite who you want to.", "Yta! It's not your problem who's she's dating and you know people bring their partners.\nI can give you on a paper that at least 10% of the people on your wedding will not be in your live anymore in 10 years so they become strangers while this man can be your family for the rest of your life.\nWhen inviting people it's so disrespectful to uninvite without a good reason especially when you decide to marry on a date like 31 december. What do you expect that's she would come alone without kids ans parent while it's the end of the year?", "ESH. I don\u2019t understand the he can\u2019t attend because I don\u2019t know him. Many plus ones include people the bride and groom don\u2019t know. They have been dating a while and have met some of the family. Sadly my brother in law of many years ruined my wedding and I knew him. Of course it\u2019s your wedding so you can dictate the invites but it sounds like you had the opportunity to address this earlier (as some of your comments indicate) and didn\u2019t.", "YTA. This isn't about some stranger, it's about making your cousin welcome and valuing her feelings.", "YTA. You are having your wedding on New Year's Eve, a holiday when many couples expect to be together to share a kiss at midnight. You knew that she has had a boyfriend for over a year and anticipated that she would want to bring him. You sent her invitation to her \"plus family\", why in the world would you think that she would willingly exclude her boyfriend who she is planning to spend her life with from a family event at New Year's? You knew she wouldn't. If you did not want him at your wedding, you are a huge asshole for not making that clear up front. Furthermore, it sounds like you don't see their relationship as legitimate because of your constant reference to them meeting online. Maybe you should examine some of your own biases and how they are coloring your actions. And ask yourself this: Why do you care if he comes or not? Does it really impact your wedding in any way if your cousin brings her long-term partner to share in a holiday celebration with family? Get some perspective.", "YTA - they have been together a year, it\u2019s not like she just met him last week.  I have been to many weddings as a plus one where I have not met the bride or groom before.  I would assume if my invitation said my family was invited, that would mean my partner as well. Would it have hurt you to include him when it obviously meant a lot to your cousin?", "INFO: did she have a plus one? Are there other couples that will be there that you haven\u2019t met? Is the issue really that you just haven\u2019t met him or that *gasp* she met him online and thus he MUST be a total creepy incel?\n\nI mean, from here, YTA but it would help knowing the answers I just proposed before making an official judgement.", "Based on your statement that there was no plus one on her invite, NTA.\n\nYou might want to edit your post and include that info though, as it seems like people are assuming that there was one.", "Soft YTA. \n\nOf course it\u2019s your wedding and the guest list is up to you, but you were unclear on your invite by not listing names and instead having \u201cYou + Family.\u201d In your eyes it meant one thing, in her eyes it meant another. You cannot fault her for your lack of clarity. You can\u2019t give her an ultimatum when you had several opportunities to clarify.\n\nYou also say she\u2019s the one you were closest to. If she\u2019s been with him for a year or so and loves him, why would you not allow him at a celebration for love? Your reasoning is that you\u2019ve never met him.

You will likely spend less than 3 minutes talking to this individual. I just had my wedding this year with 100 guests\u2026 Only reason I was able to greet most of them is because we scheduled ourselves to make the rounds to each table during dinner.

As a wedding planner I will tell you that invites are addressed very specifically when someone is NOT included. You created unnecessary drama by not being clear about who in fact was invited.

That way he won't be a complete stranger to you anymore.\n\nSticking with your position will likely destroy whatever is left of your relationship with your cousin (and her kids).", "how much focus would it be? \u201chi cousin\u2019s boyfriend. nice to meet you. thank you for coming to celebrate with us. well, gotta go talk to other guests now. enjoy yourself!\u201d\n\nfrom your comments, I\u2019ll say NTA because she wasn\u2019t given a +1. but i also think you\u2019re overthinking this way too much and it\u2019s not worth ruining the relationship you have with your cousin, even if you\u2019re no longer as close as you used to be.", "That's making you even more a asshole.\nOf i were your niece me my kinds and partner would come.\nYour making this a really big thing over nothing omg. This is why there ar stupid arguments in family's", "My kids wouldnt go if i were their mother. You exclude her partner and their stepfather, it's really wrong to do so. \nWith my family dynamic i would even say that my parents wouldn't come to your wedding to support me and my partner. You should have told on beforehand that you didn't want him there so she didn't bought tickets and a dress. To uninvite now is asshole behavior and if i was your niece we wouldn't have contact anymore", "Then why did you refer to her \u2018online boyfriend\u2019?", "YTA. While you do have a right to invite whoever you want to your wedding, this honestly could have been one of the best times to finally meet him. Your cousin seems to really like this guy if they\u2019ve been able to keep a long distance relationship for some time now. It doesn\u2019t sound like he treats her badly, and he\u2019s met other family members so you know he\u2019s a real person and not some catfish, so I don\u2019t know what other reason you have to go off of. Instead of not inviting him just because you simply haven\u2019t met him, and thus now having a negative effect on your relationship with your cousin, it could have been a positive opportunity to actually meet this person who makes your cousin happy and ring in the new year while welcoming someone new into the family.", "Exactly this", "Agreed!", "They initially met online. Because one lives in Nevada and the other lives in Florida. They fly back and forth to see each other a couple times a year and that's it. 95% of their communication is through phone calls and the like. That is why I refer to it as an \"online\" relationship", "That\u2019s called a long distance relationship", "YTA. You caused what seems like a lot of pain and stress for something that really wouldn\u2019t have affected you at all. She\u2019s been with him for a year and you seem to care about her. This feels like a super gross power trip.", "YTA. If your wedding was on a normal day you might have gotten away with it but on NYE?? You're keeping a couple apart on New Year's Eve that's a huge AH move", "YTA, because you were vague on your initial invitation, which caused what I consider very understandable confusion on her part. You\u2019ve put her in a garbage situation that she clearly did not expect, whether you meant to or not. I guess you\u2019ve learned to be extremely clear when issuing invitations. \n\nJust as an aside, this situation may lead to some real changes in your relationship with your cousin. Your decision here may well have opened  a path for her to redefine the nature of who she considers family and who considers \u201crelatives\u201d.  I assume you\u2019re comfortable with that \u2014 just don\u2019t  be surprised at where you land in that new dynamic.", "YTA. They have been together for more than a year. The only way this would be appropriate is if you also forbid other guests from bringing a +1 that you have never met. Plus, I'm guessing if they've been together for a year many of your other family has met him and can vouch for him. So unless they share some very concerning information, there is no valid reason for excluding him.", "At first I was gonna say nta, but having read this and your comments. For sure YTA . You are actively demeaning her relationship because you have a problem with online dating. You are selfish for saying she is making a choice. NO you are.", "In my country more than an half of the people from the weeding are unknown. From her side of the family and from his side of the family and the friends from the parents, but they all party together. One guest that you don't know is nothing.", "Yeah sorry but YTA. Why can't she have a +1?i bet you gave some to other guests.", "Sorry, OP, but YTA.  I'm of the opinion that you generally can't avoid inviting a relative's SO, unless you have really good reason.  The fact that you don't know her BF doesn't mean anything.  I'd suggest that you apologize, make sure he's invited with genuine and sincere welcome, and hope for the best.", "INFO how long has your cousin been in this LDR?"]}
