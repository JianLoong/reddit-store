{"id": 548, "submission_id": "ygv29z", "title": "AITA for forcing my MIL to babysit?", "selftext": "Throwaway.  \n\nEver since me (27F) and my husband Mark (30F) had our kids, my MIL had been begging to have them over every day. We live two hours away from her house, but we make sure to visit her on weekends as the kids love spending time at her place and playing with their cousins who live nearby too. \n\nHowever whenever they\u2019re at her house she never does anything for them. She doesn\u2019t make them food, doesn\u2019t look after them, and is generally just happy holding them or playing with them for a bit. Of course this is okay with us, and we are more than happy fixing them a quick snack or making sure they\u2019re well. But lately she\u2019s been calling me and Mark nonstop begging us to drop the kids at her place overnight. She says she misses spending \u2018real\u2019 quality time with them, and keeps saying I refuse to let her see them more than once a week. We tried to explain that with us being two hours away and the kids being a handful (they\u2019re energetic and very curious) it may be difficult for her. She still insisted but we ended up saying no. She ended up telling family members that we are denying her access to the children and while I didn\u2019t like it, Mark ended up agreeing to drop off the kids at her place for one day only. \n\nInto the issue. After saying goodbye to the kids Mark took me to a fancy restaurant halfway across town. He said that since the kids will be at their grandma\u2019s place we can finally have quality time. I agreed and half an hour into our evening we got a call from MIL. I was afraid at first but she said nothing happened, she just asked when will we back. I replied that we will pick up the kids at 9 am the next day, and she immediately got upset. She said she couldn\u2019t handle the kids and they kept demanding food, that she play with them, or straight up saying they want their cousins over. We tried telling her we are busy and at best will come over in a few hours, but she refused. She said she, and those are her exact words, \u201chad her fill with the children and never expected such trouble\u201d. I told her that was normal behaviour for kids their age and she started yelling at me on the phone. Mark ended up taking the phone and told her we will be over at 9 the next morning. Then he ended the call and we ended up going back to our date. \n\nNext morning we showed up at 9 exactly. Our kids were happy to see us but my MIL refused to speak to either of us. When Mark tried joking with her she screamed at him that we trapped her with our kids and that we were irresponsible and cruel. I reminded her she was the one who kept insisting we do this and she said she changed her mind and we could\u2019ve taken the kids with us and gone home. She\u2019s now telling family that we dropped the kids off at her house and refused to come pick them up and that I was super rude. I\u2019ve gotten several messages saying I should be a better DIL. AITA?\n\nEdit: my kids are around 7 and 9 because a few people asked.", "created_utc": 1667078293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygv29z/aita_for_forcing_my_mil_to_babysit/", "score": 433, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She said she couldn\u2019t handle the kids*\n\nINFO: Once you heard that, why would you decide to leave them there **overnight**?\n\nMy mother over and over said she wanted to watch my kids. But reality was, she felt that was what she was supposed to say, or that what all her grandma-friends were saying, but reality was she really didn't want to. After an hour she'd be calling asking \"*what do they do? what do they eat? what should I do with them?*\" (like, when they were 10 and could answer themselves, but she wanted to make it out like she was wrangling a herd of cattle).\n\nShe preferred the Kabuki theatre of telling me she wanted to watch them, my telling her no it's not necessary, and then she going to her friends telling them that I wouldn't let her.", "**YTA**\n\nAnd I can't believe I'm the only person saying this.\n\nYes, she begged to have the kids there. They're her grandkids, and apparently she regularly has her other grandchildren over for sleepovers, and they behave themselves, and it's not an issue. Which means that clearly, contrary to what most of the posters here are saying regarding her competence, she IS entirely competent and able to care for kids. Even you say as much.\n\nBut *she called you and told you that she couldn't handle YOUR kids and that SHE NEEDED YOU TO COME GET THEM, and you REFUSED. WTF?*\n\nFirst of all, who leaves their kids with an older person, under ANY circumstances, who has said that they feel overwhelmed, that they are uncomfortable, and that as of that conversation the kids are not welcome to continue staying there? Who uses their children TO PUNISH ANOTHER ADULT? When someone says, \"I do not want to take care of your children anymore,\" you go get them. Legally, what you did was abandonment at that point, and she could have called the cops. You're lucky that she's kind and loves your kids and didn't, but Jesus . . . who hears someone literally say, \"I can't handle your kids,\" and shrugs and walks away? \n\nSecondly, it seems clear that you're not being entirely forthright. You couch it in language mean to sound playful and like it's NBD, and like she's the problem. But as a former educator I recognise the code words you use to describe your kids: \"energetic\", \"like to explore\". That's the description of kids who are a handful at best, and at worst are obnoxious, out of control, get into everything (\"like to explore\"), and don't listen to rules or boundaries. You use the VERY familiar language of parents whose kids are a PITA and who refuse to acknowledge it. So I have trouble believing that your MIL was the problem here. Far more likely, it seems that she legitimately realised that your kids - unlike her other grandkids who, again, she regularly takes for overnights without any problems - were out of control, and she didn't feel comfortable babysitting them. NO WONDER SHE WASN'T TALKING TO YOU AFTER YOU LEFT HER ALONE TO DEAL WITH THEM OVERNIGHT. \n\nAnd I notice as well that you literally only give us the children's description of how it went . . . not hers. Gee, I wonder why. YTA, and I'll take the downvotes. Don't force people to take care of your kids after they make it clear that they are uncomfortable and your kids are too much for them.", "Esh. Her for sure, but you left your kids with someone like that after them demanding you go get them?", "YTA. Only reason I say that is they are your children. Period. She told you to come get them. You go get them. She obviously fucked around and found out but seriously they're your children.", "ESH\n\nFirst OP was probably pressured by other in thr family to give her children to MIL since MIL went around spreading lies saying OP wasnt giving her access to OP children. Not only that add that to the constant nagging by MIL\n\n\nOfc OP should have taken the children in and not have waited the next day to pick them up. But what disturbs me if that ppl r not focusing on what the MIL is doing.", "YTA. You and husband. MIL sucks a little for insisting but sounds like your kids aren't nearly as well behaved as you think and are more of a handful. YTA because you should have gone and got your kids. She said she couldn't handle them. Point made. They are still your kids and yall should have headed over and gotten them not just said to bad so sad and went about your outing.", "A very gentle ESH\n\nJust because if someone is that adamant they don't want your kids there, you should really just go pick them up- but then totally use that as ammunition for the next time she tries to pull this. \n\nThat said, I absolutely love this play. Just for my own curiosity - how in the heck did she manage her own kids?", "YTA, mainly for leaving them overnight. If you had left them a couple of hours, until you had finished your meal or something, then my verdict would be NTA. The fact is you left your two young children with an elderly woman who very clearly realized your kids were too much for her to handle, and stated unequivocally she was overwhelmed and not adequately prepared to watch your kids overnight. That's not cool to do to anyone, let alone an older person. \n\nI agree that your MIL should not have gone around telling everyone you were withholding the children from her, but when someone tells you the can't handle your kids (or even just changed their mind) you need to listen to them. No means no.", "**INFO**\n\n>the kids being a handful (they\u2019re energetic and very curious) it may be difficult for her.\n\nHow many children did you send to her and how old are they? \n\nI suspect they might be more than \"a handful\" (which is not their fault, of course).", "Oh I don\u2019t understand all these NTA because absolutely 100% YTA you used your children to prove a point. Your MiL was clearly over her limit and you just acted like spoiled children and left your kids there. Things could\u2019ve turned out very differently than perfectly healthy happy kids the next day. Obviously your kids aren\u2019t the same energetic kids as the others because she doesn\u2019t have a problem with your nieces and nephews.", "ESH. She\u2019s more of an asshole, but it\u2019s pretty wild that you weren\u2019t concerned about her willingness/ability to take care of the kids over night after her phone call. You should have gone and gotten them then and told her that she won\u2019t have the chance to keep them over night again.", "YTA \n\nI see no way a responsible parent doesn't come grab their kids when a babysitter says they're overwhelmed. Grandma or not she's not the parent and clearly telling you she's no equipped to continue to handle the children. Negligent parents just so they can have a night on the town", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t refuse to feed them, she just doesn\u2019t fill them with snacks and candy and she expects them to act like 7 and 9 year olds would. You don\u2019t mention any ASD or other needs, so one would expect a modicum of good behaviour from them. People really need to read your comments to previous questions before giving judgement", "YTA, we are not getting the full history here.", "YTA", "YTA you should have picked them up after dinner.", "NTA\n\nCan you imagine?!\nThe kids asked for food?! Outrageous!!!\nThey wanted her to play with them?! Who has ever heard of such a thing??\n\nOP, you kids are clearly monsters. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\nOn the plus side, I'm sure she'll stop nagging you to bring them over!", "YTA. You should have finished your dinner and collected your children. She told you she couldn't handle them...if she can't handle them, then there is a potential SAFETY issue!  You don't take chances with that. Granted, once you picked them up, any time she asked to babysit in future should be met with a reminder that she \"cant handle\" the kids and a refusal.", "oh come on now you already know the answer to this, she asked for it, she fucked around and found out. Next time she does this laugh at her and be like last time you acted like a complete asshole im not lifting a finger for you if you want to visit you can drive your old fat boomer ass out here", "NTA. She got what she wanted, she would have complained no matter what, at least you got a date night out of it.", "NTA and time for NC/LC with MIL.  Have your husband deal with it from now on.  Anyone who says your are a bad DIL needs to be blocked from social media and your life as well.  You are under no obligation to deal with all of this drama on top of having two young children.", "**NTA**\n\nVaguely reminds me of a female co-worker whose husband complained when he had to babysit their children.  She was quick to remind him that it was called \"being a parent\".\n\nGrandma isn't babysitting.  She is being a grandma who wants to spend time with her grandkids (including overnight) until she doesn't because she can't handle things despite being forewarned of the potential consequences.\n\nShe's TA for involving other family members on both sides of the issue of \"they won't let me see them\" and \"they won't take them away\".", "YTA I can\u2019t believe you left your kids with someone after they said they couldn\u2019t deal with them. Even if you wanted to make a point with her, you failed your kids completely.", "YTA. And whe  someone describes their kids as energetic and very curious I immediately hear, badly disciplined", "NTA. She fucked around and found out. You warned her several times and told her she couldn't handle it and since she insisted you proved your point.", "ESH, you gave her what she wanted and then she turned around and didn\u2019t like it. Kids require a lot of patience and based on your comments (saying she watches other kids) her reaction is puzzling. But you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Edit: INFO why does MIL watch the other kids fine but not your kids? I think something is missing here. Also changed the rating to ESH for the time being until more info is provided.", "YTA\nYou basically wanted to teach your MIL a lesson about how much work your kids really are.  You could have retrieved the kids after your meal.  But - nope.  \n\nAlso 7 and 9? Your kids shouldn\u2019t be that much work.  They should be able to get themselves snacks and entertain themselves with mild supervision.   But that wasn\u2019t your question.  I think you are the AH bc you knew she was overwhelmed and instead of graciously taking your kids back you wanted to punish her.", "NTA. For starters, your MIL needs to start telling the truth. Tell the family members what really happened, and if they won't listen, block them. Then tell MIL that she won't be seeing her grandchildren again for a long time.", "ESH. You did leave your kids and refuse to come pick them up so what she's telling the family is the truth. \nShe didn't need to be pushy and obviously has an idea of how they behave if she sees them every weekend. \nShe also clearly manages her other grandkids over night so there's a reason she couldn't handle yours. \nLook you gave it a shot, she can't handle it, I highly doubt she will but if she asks again just remind her of this.", "ESH\n\nShe sent her flying monkeys at you and was being completely unreasonable and unwilling to listen to you, the parents, who know your kids (and her\u2026) best.\n\nI would have let her sweat for a bit. \u201cYou asked for this!\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want to interfere with your time!\u201d  \u201cCousin Sally insisted you needed this time with them, we can try to go over but we\u2019d hate to upset Sally!\u201d \n\nAnd then go pick up your kids after a few hours.

Not for their sake, but for my dog\u2019s! I don\u2019t want him in a bad spot, I care about his well-being too much.\n\nAlso I for sure thought your kids were like 3 and 5, not 7 and 9. Are they well behaved?", "I\u2019m gonna go with ESH. As a mother of a child with an overbearing grandma that constantly begs for \u201cgrandma time\u201d and yet will cancel on watching him for no reason, she needed something dramatic to make all the begging stop. \n\n**But** being the parents, you know what their behavior is really like and know it can get extremely overwhelming. \n\nBright side: she\u2019s not going to beg for any visits for a while", "YTA. Sounds like your children have zero boundaries and are more than a handful. Funny how she has no problem with the cousins. What you did was cruel and selfish. Be a better parent.", "ESH.  You knew what was going to happen and you should never have left them in the first place.  If you wanted to make the gesture you should have built up to it, leaving then a couple of hours first, not so long on the first time and not overnight.  Then when she called you should have gone and got them after dinner.  It was not a safe situation to leave your kids in.  Your MIL obviously has issues - not sure how she raised kids on the first place but I'm guessing you have twins and two at once is a lot. She shouldn't have made a big deal about having them or getting rid of them.  But you shouldn't have let it happen.  ESH\nETA sorry just saw the edit and some of your comments - your kids are 7 and 9 but the way you talk about them makes them seem way younger, which is a bit weird. And you grounded them for asking to play hide and seek?  It all sounds quite odd.  It's probably less unsafe leaving them there at that age (I was thinking they were 3 or 4 from your description) but I still think ultimately you don't leave kids somewhere they're not wanted. And I think you need to not worry about snacks so much - you could be setting them up with life long health issues. Let them eat if they're hungry but don't make it a constant offering. It's sounds to me like you and your MIL have very different approaches to parenting.  Kids don't need to be played with constantly and need to make their own fun.  If they're never bored you're not doing them any favours.", "YTA.", "People are allowed to change their minds. Revoked consent is not consent.

She lies to the rest of the daily, harassed you to bring them over, and she pretty much got what she deserved. \n\nMy only pause is, like, what about your kids thigh?

OP literally said her kids are a handful so she\u2019s not lying to herself about how her kids behave. And they demanded food? FFS are you kidding me? Humans eat and MIL doesn\u2019t photosynthesize so she obviously cooks for herself. Wtf did she think would happen when she had two kids at her house over night? They just wouldn\u2019t eat from the time they arrived to the time they left? OP and her husband also **said no** to this sleepover and MIL then ran to the family and **lied** about them denying her access to the kids. Not to mention the fact that if she wanted those kids gone the entire night, and yelled at their dad the next day about being \u201ctrapped\u201d with **her own** grandchildren, they **definitely** caught the vibes if not **heard her**. You don\u2019t get to **bully your son and DIL** to get what you want then decide out of **nowhere** \u201cnvm fuck these kids and their requests for basic human needs\u201d. They didn\u2019t just show up on MILS doorstep with the kids out of the blue, she knew they were coming. \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA, but MIL absolutely is. I\u2019m sorry your kids potentially caught the unwanted vibe from their fucking grandma who has obviously raised children before and bullied their parents into dropping them off for a sleepover.

You gave her exactly what she asked for and she\u2019s the victim?  Perfect example of be careful what you ask for. She\u2019s lucky that either of you speak to her. When your kids get older and want to know why she doesn\u2019t like them, tell them about this. She\u2019s not only a terrible mother, MIL but also a terrible grandmother. You forced nothing on her, she begged, even when you explained that your children can be a handful. NTA", "Rofl. NTA. And tell your side.

She brought this on herself and you warned her prior. She's only got herself to blame.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t force her to do anything.

She can give apples or toast for snacks. \n\nOtherwise NTA", "NTA Nothing you describe is unusual for kids that age. You even told her no & she bad mouthed you to other people.

We live two hours away from her house, but we make sure to visit her on weekends as the kids love spending time at her place and playing with their cousins who live nearby too. \n\nHowever whenever they\u2019re at her house she never does anything for them. She doesn\u2019t make them food, doesn\u2019t look after them, and is generally just happy holding them or playing with them for a bit. Of course this is okay with us, and we are more than happy fixing them a quick snack or making sure they\u2019re well. But lately she\u2019s been calling me and Mark nonstop begging us to drop the kids at her place overnight. She says she misses spending \u2018real\u2019 quality time with them, and keeps saying I refuse to let her see them more than once a week. We tried to explain that with us being two hours away and the kids being a handful (they\u2019re energetic and very curious) it may be difficult for her. She still insisted but we ended up saying no. She ended up telling family members that we are denying her access to the children and while I didn\u2019t like it, Mark ended up agreeing to drop off the kids at her place for one day only. \n\nInto the issue. After saying goodbye to the kids Mark took me to a fancy restaurant halfway across town. He said that since the kids will be at their grandma\u2019s place we can finally have quality time. I agreed and half an hour into our evening we got a call from MIL. I was afraid at first but she said nothing happened, she just asked when will we back. I replied that we will pick up the kids at 9 am the next day, and she immediately got upset. She said she couldn\u2019t handle the kids and they kept demanding food, that she play with them, or straight up saying they want their cousins over. We tried telling her we are busy and at best will come over in a few hours, but she refused. She said she, and those are her exact words, \u201chad her fill with the children and never expected such trouble\u201d. I told her that was normal behaviour for kids their age and she started yelling at me on the phone. Mark ended up taking the phone and told her we will be over at 9 the next morning. Then he ended the call and we ended up going back to our date. \n\nNext morning we showed up at 9 exactly. Our kids were happy to see us but my MIL refused to speak to either of us. When Mark tried joking with her she screamed at him that we trapped her with our kids and that we were irresponsible and cruel. I reminded her she was the one who kept insisting we do this and she said she changed her mind and we could\u2019ve taken the kids with us and gone home. She\u2019s now telling family that we dropped the kids off at her house and refused to come pick them up and that I was super rude. I\u2019ve gotten several messages saying I should be a better DIL.

That isn\u2019t her trying to get out of something. That\u2019s something seriously wrong behaviorally. You should have picked them up.", "I agree. I was expecting the kids to be much younger from her description of behavior. At 7 and 9 they should be able to have a pleasant night with grandma without making her run screaming", "For real. OP acts as if the children were a squaky piece of furniture or something - some sort of item that annoys and has no needs, wants or feelings itself.\n\nChildren are people. *Dependent* people.

I would pick up my kids right away.", "Well said.", "she didn\u2019t make her. she said no repeatedly and the mil kept pushing. the fact that she continually forces them to make the two hour drive just for a few hours of quality time is also bs. she warned mil that they would be a lot and that she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle them. also one of mil\u2019s complaints was them \u201cdemanding food\u201d what bs. and of course the running to complain to the family that she wasn\u2019t letting her see the kids when she first denied her watching them. the mil asked for it", "MIL knows how these children behave, whether it is as you say or not. And she repeatedly DEMANDED they be brought for the night. OP didn\u2019t spring some unknown demon children on MIL.", "Is it possible they were a handful because they weren\u2019t being fed? I mean she called and complained they wanted food.", "YTA- those terms you used to describe your kids led me to believe they were toddlers. FYI- consent can be withdrawn at ANY time.", "I want to add that if they were going to leave the kids OVERNIGHT,  it should have been made very CLEAR even before they left. Did they even pack an overnight bag for the kids? Dropping kids to stay overnight with no warning is a AH thing to do.\n\nLike why would MIL need to phone to find out when you coming back, did she think you were just out running errands or on a short date that doesn't make sense to me.\n\nWhe I babysat and food options for children was always discussed before the parents left. It's usually parents that supply the food unless something else was arranged prior (some parents are very strict with meals a diets or allergies). I didn't mind cooking for the kids but it is not a simple thing.\n\nLeaving the kids without ensuring they will get properly fed is negligence. One lovely mom used to even pack me a extra dinner meal, so I could eat the same things with the kids at meal time. She was a firm believer in adults modelling good eating habits for their kids. She wanted me to model good eating with her kids, but she didn't put the work on me to provide the \"healthy meals\". she took responsibility to provide the food so I could facilitate her needs and beliefs.", "I understand where you are coming from and completely accept your judgment. But I felt like I need to clarify some things: \n\nWhen I asked my MIL what they did she said they kept asking for their cousins and not her when they first arrived. I admit they can be a bit of a handful, but they are well behaved and don\u2019t act out especially around her. She said that they kept talking throughout the movie, asking for popcorn and snacks, and asking her to play hide and seek after she said she was tired which I did speak to them about and they have been grounded for. But otherwise that\u2019s all she said, she refused to specify how they misbehaved in any way. \n\nSecondly, it was my husband\u2019s decision to send them over and keep them there. I disliked it but he told me that his mom usually does this to the other kids. As in she\u2019ll call BIL and tell him to come pick up the kids at 12 in the night because she wants to wake up \u201cin peace and quiet\u201d the next day. Her behaviour isn\u2019t new or unique to us. But she still hosts them over a lot more than us because they live across the street. \n\nFinally and again, I understand your point and your comments about leaving them overnight. I can see now that I may have slipped and did something wrong, and I\u2019ll try my best to never do it again. I appreciate each comment and feedback on the situation. So thanks for taking time to write this out!", "Agree 100%!", "I'm struggling with this a little bit. I reread it and does it say she takes the kids' cousins for overnights? I'm not seeing it. Also, while I agree it's possible the kids were worse-behaved than OP leads us to believe, it's entirely MIL's fault that she never bothered to spend time with the kids while OP and Mark were there: she clearly had no idea what they were actually like. She just gets to say hi, snap a pic, and then let them and the cousins entertain each other. (which honestly isn't inherently a bad thing, but you don't get to then turn around and act like you know how things are going to go with the kids better than *their own parents*, and you also don't get to whinge about how you want quality time when you aren't taking the time available to build a relationship with them.\n\nThis is at least ESH. OP's decision to pick the kids up doesn't erase the other shitty things MIL has done, not least of which is the entitlement of complaining that once a week, which is EXTREMELY generous when they live 2 hours away, isn't enough time with the kids, and then turning around and spreading nasty rumors about withholding the grandkids to the rest of the family.", "I agree with most you wrote. However I read this as the grandmother being competent looking after quiet kids, not kids in general. \n\nMy oldest son (2,5) is highly intelligent which is causing sleep problems (since he was a baby) he is also an extremely busy body and rarely just sits down longer than 20 min. I absolutely hate it when people tell us we are too cautious with him, but they aren\u2019t aware of his abilities and it can cause dangerous situations. Our youngest son (1) is active as well, but not as much as his brother. I don\u2019t think a lot of people can watch our kids at the same time because I know they are a handful. \n\nI think the grandmother should have been aware that her grandchildren aren\u2019t as easy as she expected them to be (I mean she knows them longer than a few days so she should have known) and shouldn\u2019t have pushed a sleepover if she has never looked after them during the day. \n\nHowever OP and husband should have dropped everything to go pick up their kids. I would not leave my children with anyone who sounds like they can\u2019t look after them. I would never entertain their thoughts for babysitting again though and I would also be very annoyed that my date with my husband was cut short.", "I fully agree to this.

I can\u2019t appreciate that at all.", "this is the one. OP shouldn't have trusted MIL even if her husband did, because MIL explicitly stated she wasn't able to care for their kids. But MIL and Hubby started the whole thing - she needed to lay the F off on the \"visits\" and \"withholding\" shit, and he needed to be firmer with his OWN MOTHER that she needed to back tf off. \n\nOP is only guilty of being guilted and manipulated. It IS her problem, but I can't feel that negatively toward her because it's clear this family is full of shitheads.", "I sort of understand OP's perspective. My MIL also lives 2 hours away and would repeatedly make poorly thought out plans and then paint me as the bad guy for declining to do what she wanted or suggesting some sort of modification. OP repeatedly declined the sleep over request, and was worn down until she acquiesced. They drove 2 hours there to drop the kids off, then 2 hours back home for their dinner, and MIL wanted them to come back (another 2 hours) and bring the kids home (another 2 hours). That's 8 hours of driving in one day.", "I totally agree with you ESH.", "So MIL had NO PART in endangering or hurting the kids? She didn't DEMAND and send flying monkeys to make it so OP and hubby would be bullied into giving her the kids overnight? She didn't DEMAND an overnight only to tell OP and hubby they needed to pick the kids up?\n\nYes, OP is AN asshole, but really, MIL didn't do asshole shit here? Really?", "So, the kids are there every weekend and she DOESN'T know they're terrors - is that REALLY someone who deserves to bitch about how \"DIL doesn't let me see the kids because i can't get an overnight\"?\n\nReally?", "\"MIL sucks a little\" lol that's sweeping like 75% of the post under the rug", "Seriously? It's called getting older.

Hopefully your mother in law has learnt her lesson and won't be asking for the kids to stay over anytime soon.  Next time just say no and stand buy it x", "I suggest sitting down with your BiL and SIL. You need to discuss a way to handle MIL and her pleading and manipulation to have your children but then not being able to handle it because right now she\u2019s running the show with her  complaining. \n\n1) MIL uses you all as ways to get what she wants by complaining and claiming to be neglected and separated from her grandchildren. She has plenty of contact with you all, regular visits, etc. she is not neglected. You all need to agree to ignore or shut down such complaints, she can\u2019t put you against each other if you set a firm boundary. \n\n\n2) Despite her claims to want her grandchildren overnight she clearly isn\u2019t capable or willing to actually follow through. This isn\u2019t just your children this one time, she constantly calls BiL to come get his kids after she\u2019s begged for overnights and then bails. This is a pattern of behaviour and she\u2019s showing with her actions that she genuinely can\u2019t tolerate looking after children for more than an hour or two at most. The problem is that while BIL lives across the street so this, while annoying, isn\u2019t a major problem you and your family live two hours away so even if you left the restaurant immediately and got the kids it would have taken a couple of hours to get there. The consequence of this should be that MiL is never to be allowed to babysit more than a planned couple of hours. You supply them snacks and food which they can get themselves so that they aren\u2019t hassling MiL. However I don\u2019t think she should babysit for some time, it must have been very uncomfortable for her and the children to be pushed together overnight. They will have felt her dislike of them and whether they were regular kid annoying or actually misbehaving they had no way to get out of where they were.\n\n3)I would suggest that their behaviour may be different when their cousins are there because they can play while MiL doesn\u2019t engage with them as much. I genuinely don\u2019t think she\u2019s capable, whether she recognises that or not, of looking after young children. She may have a vision in her head of how she\u2019s should act or they should be but not actually be able to follow through. Kids talk while watching tv, kids ask for snacks, kids want to interact with you. If they are used to always seeing grandma around their cousins then they may not understand why grandma doesn\u2019t want to play with them or talk to them or why she expects them to be like older kids of 12 or more who are able to sit and watch tv without interacting. Now they\u2019ve had an experience with her which was not great and depending on how out of her depth she felt that put them into a potentially dangerous situation. Never leave children with a caregiver who can\u2019t cope, whether they nag you or not.

They sound like toddlers", "So OP having these kids over EVERY weekend, and being VERY clear that they're a handful, wasn't enough to prepare MIL? \n\nFrankly, how could a grandma who sees the kids EVERY WEEK be so blind about their behavior that she's blindsided by how difficult they are without their parents around to do all the actual work?

Okay, so the MIL begged and fussed. Maybe she\u2019s a pain in the ass for getting what she whined for.

MIL is stated to have said she \"had her fill\", not that they were uncontrollable. \n\nNot only that, the kids are stated to be over at Gma's EVERY WEEK. Unless she's totally ignoring them despite asking to have the family over, why wouldn't Gma know how the kids act BEFORE *DEMANDING* an overnight?\n\nSo, what are you seeing that I'm not?

It could mean a lot of things. \n  \nThere's \"demanding food\" and then there's \"*demanding food*\".\n  \nThe grandma seems to have raised at least one child from infancy to adulthood, so it seems she knows that children need to eat on a regular basis. \n  \nOP didn't mention that her MIL used to withhold food from her husband as a child, so I think MIL is probably at the very least a competent provider of food for children.\n  \nI wonder if by \"demanding food\", the kids were refusing the food MIL made, or if they were demanding third and fourth helpings. Or if they said no altogether, and demanded burgers and pizza and screamed and threw tantrums when MIL said \"no\".  \n  \nHey, kids can be picky eaters. My kid (6), is starting to express her own tastes when it comes to food, and will say when she doesn't like something I make for dinner.

That's why ESH would be my vote - MIL knew what she was getting into and didn't want it, but still demanded and guilted and sent flying monkeys to get it, then wanted to renege privately. OPs husband wanted to teach her liar MIL a lesson, and OP didnt stand her ground, so the kids couldve suffered. Every really sucks.", "grounding young kids because they wanna play hide and go seek is never acceptable lmao, that\u2019s crazy, what are they even grounded from? toys? they\u2019re kids not teenagers , and it\u2019s normal for kids to ask multiple times in a row if they aren\u2019t redirected to a different activity", "Because, as I said, they know the whole situation, while we don't. If the husband felt comfortable leaving the kids overnight with his mother, common sense says he knew she was full of it when she said, \"I can't handle this!\" It's his MOTHER. I think it's safe to assume he has a solid understanding of her babysitting skills. It's not that she *couldn't* handle the kids---it's that she no longer *wanted* to. They are seven and nine years old, and it sounds like their only \"misbehavior\" was wanting to see their cousins and being hungry.", "But the OP is who was wrong in this situation IMO. I'd it came down to it I'd vote YTA to OP not MIL.", "Feel better now?", "Whenever parents describe children as \"a handful, energetic, very curious\" I immediately get the idea that the kids are horrible  brats and that anyone who isn't their parents (teachers, relatives, etc) would probably describe them in very different terms.\n\nPlus, \"demanding food, wanting to play with her and asking if the cousins could come over\" sound like pretty bratty behaviour. When I was a child of that age and I asked my grandma if I could have/do something and she said no that was it. Here it sounds like these kids kept badgering the grandma about these things and wouldn't take no for an answer.", "I can see why you wouldn\u2019t want to say a complete y t a for the part others played. but esh would be reasonable, because ultimately op made the decision to not go get the kids, and left them with someone incapable.", "\"Wahh, OP is a big meanie isolating me from my grannndddchillddreeen,, wahhhh\" IS weaponizing the children. She used them as a weapon to bully OP and her husband, and then once she was tired of them she wanted them gone despite what she'd begged and demanded and bullied for. \n\nIt is explicitly stated that it is NOT fine when she \"babysits\" the cousins for \"overnights\" - she frequently calls BIL to come get his kids in the middle of the night for no reason besides \"I want to wake up to peace and quiet\". That's not fine, that's a nasty thing to do to the BIL and to his children. \n\nAgain, if the kids are such terrors how was this not apparent once in the YEARS of weekly visits? How did she not know, after spending years with the kids, and after hearing the parents say \"We don't think you can handle it\", why would she think she can handle it? Why would she NOT be an asshole in this situation for bullying and begging and overstepping the boundaries OP and Mark initially set?\n\nI never said OP or Mark were right to leave the kids there, but you and a lot of people here are shitting on OP for mishandling a situation MIL and Mark put her in, and not shitting on MIL or Mark at all. That's gross.", "OP was 100% pressured. It is literally in the post:\n\n>She ended up telling family members that we are denying her access to the children and while I didn\u2019t like it, Mark ended up agreeing to drop off the kids at her place for one day only.\n\nLike, I get that we all have very little sympathy for weakspine people who allow their children to be abused, but HOW is YTA a top comment? ESH is the LEAST I could issue here, because NO NEW PARENTS DESERVE TO GET BERRATED ABOUT WHO CAN HAVE THEIR CHILD OVERNIGHT.", "To be fair, there is a limited number of possibilities.", "With my MIL who badgered me into even bringing them over? Probably not overnight but I would have slowly finished my dinner before getting them. Her son was the one who decided for the morning, not the OP but hey, let's give the badgering MIL a full pass shall we?", "because it's his mom, who parented him, and whom he knows best? because the child is just as much his as it is hers? \n\nwould i NOT be an AH thing to say \"I don't trust your mother even though: you do; she's physically and mentally capable; she is telling us, the community, and God she wants and is ready for an overnight\"? Should OP have just said to her husband \"Your mother is a liar and we both know it\"?", "So you're ignoring EVERYTHING in OPs post to call her a bad mom with bad kids?\n\nShe is there EVERY WEEK. MIL DEMANDED AN OVERNIGHT. MIL got other family members to ALSO BULLY OP AND HUSBAND ABOUT MIL GETTING AN OVERNIGHT. \n\nWhat, exactly, are you seeing that says MIL had no idea what these kids were like?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yeah, it is abandonment, because MIL is a LIAR, WHO LIED, TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE INCLUDING THE PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN and only THEN did OP abandon her children overnight? Why isn't MIL ALSO an AH?", "Okey dokey! Have a great day!", "I personally don\u2019t have a problem with the way you\u2019ve formatted yourself, but all caps can read as yelling/screaming on the internet, which does bother some people. \n\nAnother way to add emphasis is with bold or italics or both! And then it doesn\u2019t read as you yelling anymore. \n\nIf you add a set of asterisks at the beginning and end around a word or set of words, it will *italicize* them. \n\nA set of two asterisks at beginning and end will **bold** them. \n\nA set of three asterisks at beginning and end will ***bold and italicize*** them.", "It's not that they don't understand caps are for emphasis. It doesn't make sense why you chose to emphasize that particular set of words.", "Perhaps it was a matter of \"fine, you've been warned. You get what you wanted\" so she stops asking and smearing them for refusing", "Another reason why OP shouldn\u2019t have freaking ABANDONED THEIR CHILDREN - MIL was clearly overwhelmed.", "So, if you were being attacked and bullied by everyone close to you about a LIE (remember, MIL is a LIAR, WHO REPEATEDLY LIES TO BOTH HER SONS), what would you do? Would you be the ONLY AH if you broke and let the idiots in your life do their thing for a night, and immediately agreed you were wrong to do so?\n\nWhy isn't MIL ALSO and AH? Why isn't it ESH? Hubby is there too - why isn't is \"ESH besides the kid\"? He is JUST as culpable, if not MORE because HE was the one saying it would be okay and to do it. So, why? Why is OP TA  and no one else?", "But voting both is an option on this sub and it's clearly more correct than voting just OP. Why would you not take that option?", "I'm pretty sure you're trying to portray my irritation with all the people in this thread totally ignoring the lying MIL being a big ol drama producing liar as childish, but you kind of failed because I'm pretty sure very few people will see this piddly comment thread, and even fewer will be on your side when they do. So good show, I guess?", "see here's the thing - yeah, op is AN asshole. because exactly why you said.\n\nbut is mark not ALSO AN asshole, and frankly more of one because he was the one to convince OP to leave the kids at first AND after MIL reneged?\n\nis MIL not ALSO AN asshole, for demanding and bullying and getting flying monkeys to bully OP and her husband to allow a visit she almost immediately reneged on?\n\nLike I don't know how to express this better - OP IS AN ASSHOLE. But the way this thread is acting, you'd imagine she dropped her kids off with a hooker and went to do blow! NO! She dropped them of with THEIR FATHER'S MOTHER, WHO REPEATEDLY DEMANDED THEY DO SO AND ATTESTED SHE COULD HANDLE THEM!\n\nWas she wrong for not picking them up when KNOWN LIAR MIL reneged? Yes. Was she in the wrong for being LIED TO and BULLIED and COERCED by ALL (and I do mean ALL, even Mark got in on the convincing/coercing of OP to make the initial bad decision to leave the kids) of her husband's family? Yea, cause her kids COULD HAVE (they DIDN'T but they 100% COULD HAVE) gotten hurt or neglected.\n\nBut again, I would say that even if they HAD gotten hurt - this liar MIL and this \"use my kids to make a point to my mother\" husband would be WORSE.", "Thank god I found someone like u that gets it. People aren't taking in account on what the MIL is doing and are only focusing on how OP didn't pick up the children and let them stay overnight.", "Who said I gave MIL a full pass? OP is a big girl and can speak up and get her kids after dinner. She\u2019s an asshole mainly because it was overnight, and dismissed her MIL\u2019s concerns.", "I don\u2019t think OP would be an asshole if she said \u201chey, sounds like things aren\u2019t going great, let\u2019s go pick up the kids.\u201d After, you know, grandma B called and asked them to do so. Is the husband not an asshole for basically saying \u201cmy mother is a liar and we both know it, so let\u2019s ignore that she no longer feels capable of caring for our kids\u201d?", "Also, you\u2019ve been on here for a year and you are not aware that many people are unable to see what their parents are actually like?", "You seem really bent out of shape for something that has nothing to do with you. This is hilariously pathetic of you. WHEN YOU USE ALL CAPS DO YOU THINK PEOPLE CARE MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID? Because I assure you. Just like In your real life no one cares for your opinion online either. Yes. She\u2019s a bad mom who abandoned her badly behaved kids.", "Yes.", "are you okay? i literally never defended op i\u2019ve literally been questioning what weirdo would ground their children over an issue they caused this entire time ??", "He was also the one that put his foot down about not coming g back until the next morning. Husband and MIL are the biggest assholes here. This was their little power struggle and just happened to put OP in the middle", "Um because it's my vote and that's what my opinion is. Are you trying to bully me over changing my opinion LMAO? If it makes you feel better the husband is a major AH too. It doesn't matter what the MIL did or didn't do she told them to come get THEIR children. They should have done so then cut contact. Being a parent means the kids are your responsibility especially when they're minors.", "LMAO mainly because it's not that serious and not what I choose to do. The only one here who is an actual AH is the parent who refused to pick up their children. Period. Doesn't matter why they were asked but they were and they didn't.", "Dude you're the one having a meltdown.", "which is why i said esh is reasonable \ud83d\ude05 jeez", "someone give this person a [*insert favorite food or drink*]!\n\n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb", "YES, thank you! Like obvs OP is being AN AH - not picking up your kids when their guardian says \"I don't wanna take care of them\" IS bad. But like, MIL is just as bad? She demanded, attested she'd be fine, bullied and got others to bully OP and her husband, only to almost immediately renege? Absolutely vile and nasty behavior on the part of MIL, but no one is shitting on her as hard as OP.", "Hm, so basically your solution is for OP and Hubby to be the same pushovers everyone else is (picking their kids up with liar MIL wants them to), or they be the family punching bags when MIL lies (AGAIN!) about them \"withholding\" the kids?\n\nThat was really passive aggressive, but really that's what I think. What WAS OP supposed to do here? How COULD they avoid being alienated and insulted by the people MIL manipulated without exposing their kids to potential danger? \n\nI absolutely think MIL and Hubby are Assholes here. It is undeniably ESH even without more info. Your comment just echoed a lot of \"YTA\" comments where they clearly think OP is the only one in the wrong here and it got my goat.", "lol this account has been here for a year but you'd be stupid to think a reddit account age shows how old or internet savvy the user is. \n\nmy point is that MIL is a liar, she's lying to everyone, Mark (Hubby) clearly knows this, and OP was put in a most unadvantageous position by MIL and Mark due to this. OP was either going to call her husband and MIL liars and child-endangering people, or she was going to allow this shitshow to happen. She WAS an AH because she DID endanger her children, but Mark and MIL are JUST AS BAD, if not WORSE because they ORCHESTRATED this shitshow.", "I\u2019m sorry if you thought I was yelling at you - I wasn\u2019t.  I was yelling at the situation.  It baffles me that a parent could hear someone being overwhelmed by their own children and just not give a flying fig.  The level of selfishness that embodies is off the charts,", "lol \"bully\" it's a comment thread, block me if you feel personally attacked. you're on a debate sub, don't be thin-skinned. \n\nif the hubby is an AH too, why don't you vote ESH? why is only mom an AH?\n\nI don't care if you change your opinion, you're a top commenter but OP is getting plenty of actual empathetic responses so your opinion doesn't really matter. I just think the world would be better if people examined things like this more closely, especially their initial responses.", "tell me you've never seen a meltdown without telling me you've never seen a meltdown", "my apologies - YTA is the top comment and most people I've been speaking with in this thread believe YTA is the right judgement so I got a bit lost in just refuting your arguments because they seemed to say YTA would also be a logical judgement, which i just don't get. you being reasonable and saying you do see that ESH might be a good judgement makes me feel regretful about snapping at you like you were one of the ruder people i've been talking with, so i would like to apologize again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA : I MF LIED, you ARE a person who decided to engage because I shared a lot of opinions on this thread, and you clearly think I'm arguing just to disagree. I DON'T apologize for snapping at you, because you came at me first even when I was clearly right. Rude as hell in my opinion.", "MIL is just wanting to play the part of a fun grandma without doing the actual work of taking care of kids.", "YES  I swear this whole time I have been scrolling through the comments I have only seen like a few comments that actually focus on  MIL.", "My solution is that they put the kids first and either not agree to the sleepover or pick them up when needed. Who cares what the rest of the family thinks?", "completely agree , like i could maybe understand showing up after they had dinner but being gone the whole night is crazy", "My opinion obviously matters to you lmao. The husband didn't write this. I'm basing it soley on who wrote it and giving my opinion. I don't know what top commenter means as social media is not that extreme to me and I don't break it down because I truly don't care. I'm just here for the comments when I'm bored lol. Either way with each other situations we're only getting one side and supposed to take it for what they say. I don't even believe most of the situations so it's more just entertainment for me. Either way she's the AH IMO. Stay belssed.", "You sure seem to be and overly invested. Move on already man", "don\u2019t worry about it. i think the judgement should\u2019ve been esh, not one way or the other. everyone involved could have made better choices in what they did, for example mil needs to stop asking to let the kids sleepover and husband shouldn\u2019t have said screw that we\u2019ll leave them there until the morning, and op should have put her foot down about the matter. i feel like a lot of people were so focused on what op did wrong, and that\u2019s why it was judged that way.", "100%!! The family interactions sealed it for me - how, The Fuck, does a MIL who doesn't even wanna feed them while the whole nuclear family is there gonna say \"OP is mean and withholding my grandchildren because I can't get overnights\"? How, THE FUCK, does that same MIL get away with saying \"Ok, they've been here a few hours and tired of them, take them back now\" with no consequences?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMIL *WILL* do this over and over again. She will do it to OP and her hubby just like she does to BIL. Mark is an asshole, MIL is an asshole, and because OP left her kids with the liar MIL she's also an AH.", "so yes, your solution IS for OP and husband to be bullied and maligned for absolutely no reason. you can just say you think liars should get a pass while honest people should become liars to support them. \n\nyou could've said ANYTHING - \"My solution is for OP and Mark to put MILs texts/calls on blast\", \"My solution is for OP and Mark to demand MIL call the nearby BIL first to see if she'd be willing to embarrass herself that way\", \"My solution is for OP and Mark to demand BIL set the record straight with family about how MIL is a lying liar to tells lies and stop them from harassing OP and Mark due to the lying liars lies\" - but you CHOSE to say \"they should suck it up and not be worried about all their family harassing them\".", "i wonder why my responding to your popular comment in disagreement means \"\\[your\\] opinion obviously matters to \\[me\\]\" and YOU responding to my MUCH LESS popular comments in disagreement with me is NOT my opinion mattering to you. \n\ntop commenter means you've got the most upvoted comment within a thread. get internet literate, don't act like internet literate people are tools for knowing the right lingo.

I like arguing, and I like hoping other people might get better, but you're a lost cause because you clearly think you're right no matter what, so bye.", "i AM invested. i'm defending my ideals, i don't see why a person should be dispassionate about that?", "i rudely took it back and i mean it, why'd you start this comment chain by asking if i commented on everyone who disagrees with me? that's mf rude, and i regret i didn't realize you were that person until after i commented. i take it back, and i don't want you to be nice or agree with me now just because i was nice to you, because i was only nice because i didn't realize you were the person trying to shit on me from before.", "YES EXACTLY IF I COULD I WOULD UPVOTE U A 100x times. This situation is so messy but OP is an  AH sure but there's others who also made mistakes which people r turning a blind eye to.
