Note that all these properties are OLD, meaning no modernization or any type of construction were ever made on them since the 60\u2019s (the rented properties have very low rent). My parents are the main caretakers of the godmother and as they are both retired, they have time to take her from the nursing home she is in to some walks, to the beach, to any family occasion, etc. My father is also the main executor of her properties right now.\n\nSo, my parents had a hard working life, we never had much money but we were never in need, which means that my parents never really \u201clived\u201d. No trips, no big holidays, nothing for themselves, ever.\nAs my father is not direct family, if and when the will will be opened, he will have to pay a big amount in inheritance tax (which they don\u2019t have the money to pay right now) and also if the houses pass to my fathers name and he decides to sell any of them, he will have to pay tax on them too.\nWell, this all can be avoided if they decide to sell now, while the godmother is still alive, as in my country the law states that houses purchased before 1989 are exempt of that tax, and as my father his the main executor, he has the legal power to do so in her name.\n\nI suggested that they sell the two rentals to avoid paying inheritance tax on them and the tax for selling, and invest that money in renovating the beach apartments, which will them become holiday rentals. This rentals would not only give them comfort and means to properly enjoy their retirement but also help me and my sister start our own families with more financial safety.\n\nThe problem is, they don\u2019t want to sell anything, saying they want to recuperate all houses (they don\u2019t have money nor time for that - father is 70) because it will all be for me and sister in the future and also because godmother is still alive. But as is, the old houses will be worth less and the ones we want to recuperate are gonna need more work, so each day the situation doesn\u2019t move, we are effectively loosing money and more importantly, time.\n\nAITA for wanting my parents to make a smart decision that can put our family in a stable financial position?\n\n[EDIT] also worth mentioning that, according to my country\u2019s laws, if a will is not executed in the 3 subsequent months after the person death, all properties and every thing mentioned in the will will be arrested by the finance department.", "created_utc": 1685864132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14054dx/aita_for_wanting_my_parents_to_sell_some/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If godma is of sound mind, she can make her own decisions on what she wants. Another way of reducing inheritance tax is to sign over the property before her death, or to add the recipient\u2019s name to the property deed as a co-owner. \n\nI also don\u2019t think the main executor of the will can have legal powers to exercise the sale of a property before the death - I\u2019m fuzzy on that law.", "Not your money, not your damn business.

Especially Godmother, if she's in shape for this. \n\n\nClearly your family is all about taking care of one another.

The fact you mentioned it helping you and your sister makes it seem selfish. Best bet is have then talk to a financial planner or tax specialist in your country, a 3rd party.\n\nGodmother is still alive and it's her property, just because your dad has the legal right to sell it doesn't mean it's the moral one, especially if gm is still mentally sound. \n\nWhatever their decision you should stay the f out of it.\n\nETA: thinking about this from your parents point of view, you came at them with spreadsheets, laws, tax brackets, different scenarios. So this is something you've been thinking about for s while and I'm guessing it came on really strong. Which does make it seem you only care about the money and the best way for them to get every last cent possible. It seems like your parents already think your an AH.", "Tricky one. I'll be in a situation like this (due to inherit a slightly run-down property that a relative is currently living in) and it pains me that it's none of my business to spend my money on the property now to bring it up to standards before it's too late and the amount required triples...\n\nYou have offered financial advice and that's as far as it goes I'm afraid. Same with me in my circumstance.\n\nNTA. Perhaps even NAH.", "Firm NTA.\n\nI'm sure some will get their knickers in a knot say that you are TA but ignore them. I work in estate planning. Everyone dies at some point and everyone should take a pragmatic approach to this sort of thing. \n\nI'm pretty sure that most people would much rather their friends and family receive a benefit from their estate after death than paying a large chunk to the tax man.\n\nI don't know the rules in the country that you live sons can't give you any advice but it might be worth seeing a local adviser and putting together a chart showing option A (doing nothing) and option B (taking some kind of action) and it might open their eyes to the issue.\n\nAt the end of the day though. If you do this and your father sticks with option A then you should respect that and leave it there.

You've been responsible and helpful. Your advice is good. I'd let a little time pass and then mention it one more time. They may have been thinking about what you said, and could be more open to considering your sound advice. \n\nI'm curious though, you said your father wasn't your \"direct family\". If he's a non-bio dad, are you sure that you will actually benefit from this down the line, anyway? If you know you will benefit, I can understand the frustration of them not wanting to pursue a more profitable outcome.\n\nAt their age, there's no way I would want the hassle of renovating or managing rental properties, though they could get an agent in for the latter. \n\nIf they ultimately decide to effectively burn some of their money, you'll have to live with it, hard as that might be.", "It happens, OP. But you are powerless in the situation.Also, you father might have emotional attachment to these properties. So, it's not your choice to make and you need to accept it.", "I understand your point of course, I should\u2019ve mentioned also that while she is alive, whatever money derives from any property, is first to guarantee her well-being (nursing home for example, currently being paid by my parents)", "Thanks!\n\nThe direct family part was that my father is not direct family from his godmother.\n\nAlso I understand that they don\u2019t want the hassle of more renovations and management, but for that me and my sister would be helping of course", "Cool cool. That STILL isn't money that should be going to them. You're not suggesting that they sell her properties to pay her fees. You want them to go on fancy holidays. You can't make yourself sound like less of a money grubber now!", "Renovations are stressful are rarely straightforward. Best option (with godmother's permission) is sell all but the most profitable property in terms of rental. Get an agent to manage that and your parents can invest the rest in stock/shares with the help of a reputable broker. Depending on how that turns out, they could 'gift' $3K (?) to you and your sister annually tax free.", "I was talking long term but I understand how it might have come out. The step I was suggesting is to guarantee their long term comfort, holidays was just an example of something they were never able to do", "I love a solid financial plan. So I understand your reasoning behind it. But you're being both pushy and entitled. \n\nFree money will give them long term comfort. Pushing for them to get even more of it **while she is alive** just makes you a greedy AH."]}
