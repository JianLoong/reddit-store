But if a woman had a child, and then decided she didn't want to be part of its life, and the father got custody, and the mother never once visited with the child, and basically decided that they didn't want to be a part of the child's life beyond just paying child support, people are generally NOT ok with that.", "Here\u2019s the problem with what you\u2019re saying: men are aware that they get little to no say over whether or not a woman carries their baby to term.

When you have unprotected sex, you\u2019re basically asking to become a parent so when it happens, step up and be the best parent you can be.

It sounds like she's been hanging out with the child all this time without asking you to be involved; did she give some indication that she would force a meeting? At 1 year old, even if they had woken you up to meet her or if you had woken up naturally and gone into the living room, if you never wanted to see her, you could have just said that instead of sneaking away in a snit.

You're 22; you know that while preventative measures lessen the chances, there is no way to absolutely prevent pregnancy when you have PIV sex with someone of the opposite sex and you're both fertile. Paying child support is good, but no one's going to hail you as the greatest guy for not being a father to your children.\n\nAlso, this \"I'm not sure\" stance is also...not great. But I agree that being a wishy washy dad that's sometimes there and sometimes \"doesn't feel like it\" will suck for her. Frankly, it sounds like she lost the lottery with you.

She took that time from him to step up and deal with like she got.  Ultimately child will not benefit from having a father barely in the picture resentful of people telling  him how he should deal and feel. \nOp be sure you can live with your decision . My best advice would be to meet with child without your family present. And I do agree you don\u2019t have to bond with child at birth to create a loving bond with your child.
