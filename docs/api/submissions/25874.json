Since men and women are not biologically equal, their choices i.e decision making capabilities, ends at different stages.", "No. Two people are responsible for the child\u2019s existence. One of them doesn\u2019t get to bail because they weren\u2019t ready. This is why birth control and condoms exist. He chose to be an idiot and not use them. Her body. Her choice.", "Still gonna have to pay child support. Do you think his new girlfriend is gonna be cool with all this? I bet she won\u2019t.", "Fuck outta here with that BS. It\u2019s so clearly and obviously a different situation since he isn\u2019t the one that would be pregnant. \nThis isn\u2019t the same argument at all. I\u2019m all for pro-choice, 1000%, it was his choice to have sex with her and not pull out or make sure his dick stayed in the condom.", "Let\u2019s agree to disagree. Probably a generational difference but actions have consequences. He may only have the legal obligation to pay child support, but I think he has a moral obligation towards the child. It\u2019s his sperm and he chose to have sex. \nThat\u2019s my opinion, you don\u2019t have to agree.", "they do, but sometimes it's a negative impact, you're being misogynistic, plain and simple, i don't think his poor mum had a crystal ball, it's not feminism to unilaterally hold women accountable with no leeway", "They were in a completely different room *in her house* and didn't include him.  They didn't pull him in at all.", "Condoms are 98% effective if used correctly every single time which people typically don\u2019t do. Typical use averages about 87% effective at preventing pregnancy", "Who is raising her daughter - what is your point?", "I don't know what you think child support it, but it's not a get out of being an asshole free card, smh.", "I think he has the right to not be involved and to not speak to the baby mum and only pay the bare legal child support. \n\nAnd I have right to asses that makes him a terrible father and an AH. I\u2019ve already agreed the mum is AH for not telling him sooner. But two assholes don\u2019t make anyone right", "Vasectomy is still not 100%", "But how do you know for sure it's not commanded by law in OP's country?", "If you want to be literal about legal rights, then you're correct. I'm talking about moral and ethical rights.", "You DO know how babies are made, right?", "If he didn\u2019t want to be a father he should have worn a condom.", ">At no point did he consent to becoming a father.\n\nAre you suggesting he was assaulted? Because i'm pretty sure that unless he didn't know where babies came from when he had sex with her, the act of *having sex* was him consenting to becoming a father.  Regardless of birth control- babies happen. \n\nMake no mistake he IS a father; a deadbeat, but still a father.", "What in the world is a financial abortion -_- if that were an option, every man would take it. Men need to accept responsibility for their actions. Pregnancy is a common side effect of sex. Conversations about a plan should happen beforehand. You can\u2019t just \u201copt out\u201d of supporting your child once it exists", "Because you're being deliberately dense to try and say women are arseholes for having an abortion so you can justify your views. We both know you are so I'm not wasting any further time on this discussion.\n\nEdit: Even editing your answer from \"Why?\" Doesn't make your views rational.", "And if she had kept her legs closed, none of this would have happened, as per your own point above. She has the option of not becoming a mother, and so should he. \n\nThere should be criminal penalties for women who hide pregnancies from the father and then show up after the fact.", "I\u2019m advocating for a financial abortion. The man says he wants nothing to do with the baby, at which point the woman can decide whether she wants to keep it and do this on her own, or get an abortion. \n\nWhat\u2019s is your issue with this option?", "If the woman can bail, so can the guy. She also chose to be an idiot and not take birth control. But she chose to keep it, he didn\u2019t. She can deal with the kid she chose to have.", "That's crazy! I had no idea after having a kid, you are bound to be single for the rest of your life. Oh wait.... you're not. People get in relationships all the time with or without kids.", "\u201cIt was his choice to have sex\u201d that is literally the same argument anti-choice people use. You have to have some serious cognitive dissonance to not recognize that. The double standards are insane.", "Id argue its more a cultural difference. Its been very clear on this AITA that a lot of peoples opinions here are based more on their countries laws when it comes to parental roles. That then influences peoples cultural upbringing which then can influence their opinions on morals.\n\nRegardless yes, its clear this a pointless topic to further push.", "Sure. A shitty father could definitely have a negative impact on any children in the same way a shitty mother can as well. \n\nAnd simply repeating the mantra \u201cyou\u2019re being misogynistic\u201d doesn\u2019t make it so. You\u2019ve provided zero evidence of your claim, just your emotions.\n\nI\u2019m not holding all women accountable. I am holding one woman accountable for being reckless with her body and bringing a child into this world with no father.", "They were sitting on completely different chairs lol", "She is raising her daughter. My point is she wanted to do it alone for the first year and not even tell him that she had his kid. He has a right to make his own decision as she did too. My point is what's good for her may not be good for him and that's why she should have had a conversation with him when she found out she was pregnant.", "Abstinence is.", "I could ask you the same thing. How do know that if it \u2018IS\u2019 commanded by law in OP\u2019s country? Unless he decided to inform us, we don\u2019t know. \n\nThese types of childcare/ parenting AITA questions have had a history muddied judgment for that very reason. We don\u2019t know OPs local law and so therefore we can only make judgment based on our own cultural upbringing.", "Still not the AH though when it comes to moral and ethical. \n\nLike I said elsewhere. I see this no different than parent(s) choosing to put a kid up for adoption. If you arent up for parenting, you arent up for parenting. Theres nothing morally wrong with that or only fulfilling your legally expected roles if thats what you prefer.\n\nIf anything, OP is an AH for seemingly being on the fence about this as opposed to making an actual decision on whether he wants to be in the kids life.", "So you\u2019re saying that women automatically consent to motherhood by having sex? Cool, so then you have no problem with completely banning abortions then.", "Okay\u2026sounds like it\u2019s time to ban abortion then, as per your argument. \n\nIf any woman didn\u2019t want to be a mother, she should\u2019ve used birth control.", "That same argument can be used when a woman wants an abortion. No one should have to be a parent when they don\u2019t want to; noncommittal and resentful parents aren\u2019t good parents.", "Now you\u2019re making the same argument as the right-wingers who want to ban abortion. \n\n\u201cWomen need to accept responsibility for their actions. Pregnancy is a side effect of sex\u201d.\n\nMen should be able to opt out within X amount of time. Once they inform the woman, she can decide whether to continue the pregnancy or have an abortion. That\u2019s fair to both parties, and is what\u2019s known as a financial abortion. Google it to learn more.", "No, I\u2019m saying that either party should be able to have an abortion. You\u2019re getting upset because you know I\u2019m right and you don\u2019t have an argument. \n\nI didn\u2019t call any women assholes - what are you talking about? I\u2019m literally advocating for abortion. \n\nAgain, you have no argument, because you know you\u2019re wrong.", "Ah, the old slut shaming route. How about if we just give men vasectomies at birth then? After all, if they didn\u2019t keep trying to put their dicks in women that shouldn\u2019t be a problem, right?", "Lots of people don\u2019t want to date people with kids.  LOTS. Even less want to date deadbeat parents.", "So you're saying men should have equal say in if a woman has an abortion or keep the baby? Because that's what you're arguing. \n\nIt's the way it works because women get pregnant, not men. It's really not difficult to understand but that's up to you.", "a kid doesn't need a deadbeat father, like a kid doesn't need a deadbeat mother, 'reckless with her body' says who", "Was this a legitimate solution?\u2026", "People should put their kid up for adoption if they need to. Usually, it involves a bit of psychological trauma, because most parents love their children. It's not this walk in the woods the way you describe it. With parents like that, is it best for the kids? Yes, but anyone who can do it that easily is an AH.", "If a woman has consensual sex, she is consenting to the possibility of becoming pregnant", "Yes, that\u2019s exactly what the world needs. More unplanned babies.\ud83d\ude44", "If men don\u2019t want to be a parents they should use condoms. You can walk into any grocery store, drug store or even gas station and buy condoms. There\u2019s no excuse. Most female contraception requires a prescription.", "Except a woman can literally DIE from a pregnancy\u2026. Don\u2019t forget that for a man, having a baby is just 5 minutes of Fucking. For a woman, it\u2019s a year or physical suffering and possible actual literal death.", "Slut shaming? Are you serious? I\u2019m repeating your argument back to you, dummy. \n\nIf you don\u2019t wanna be a mother, don\u2019t get knocked up. Exactly what you said earlier about OP - if you don\u2019t want to be father, don\u2019t knock her up. \n\nAre you sure you have the mental capacity to follow basic arguments? You\u2019re arguing against yourself.", "Yeah, for example, I'd never date a single mom, but I know people who would. \n\nAlso I want to point out how unhinged you sound in your first comment. \n\n>Once the woman is pregnant that\u2019s that. It\u2019s not his body so he has no right to an opinion on what she or any other woman does with hers.\n\n>Wear a condom or get a vasectomy. Those are where his choices begin and end.", "I\u2019m saying that women can decide if they get an abotion. Men can decide if they want any involvement with a child. It\u2019s that simple. Women are not wrong or bad for getting an abortion; men are not wrong or bad for not being involved in a child\u2019s life that they didn\u2019t want or know about. Don\u2019t put words in my mouth to try and win an argument.", "The OP already said he would pay child support, so he\u2019s not a deadbeat.  \n\n\u201cReckless with her body\u201d says any person with common sense who knows that you don\u2019t go having kids off of one night stands with strange men.", "Yes. Actions have consequences. He was not 12, he was 20. Vasectomy + condom is rather full proof.\nIf he had both and she still became pregnant, then clearly abstinence is his only option from now on until he wants to be a father (and I would change to not the AH).\nIf not, then he should have known better.\n\nWhat I say is probably old fashion but an adult should know better and men complaining about women\u2019s getting pregnant are usually the one that take no responsibility in birth control.", "Youre the one making adoption seem like a walk in the park now. There are way more valid and challenging reasons than what you mention for why someone might put a kid up for adoption. There is also a lot of reasons why it may be best for the kid to be put up for adoption, including the bio parents not loving them. Which is absolutely a none AH decision and could even be a difficult choice by the bio parent if its better for the kid. Its rarely easy unless you\u2019re just leaving them on the porch of the adoption centre and running away.", "Pregnant, but not a mother. I wonder why you made that distinction. Could it be because she has the option of aborting it?\n\nYet you have a problem with me saying the same thing about men.", "It\u2019s your argument, not mine. If consenting to have sex automatically means both parties are ready to be parents, why would we need abortion?", "If women don\u2019t want to be parents, they should be on birth control or keep their legs closed. No abortions. \n\nSee? Sounds just as idiotic as your argument. I fully support a ban on abortion until men get the right to a \u201cfinancial abortion\u201d. This double standard is bs.", "[removed]", "I agree, if he doesn't want anything to do with the kid then that's his choice and he needs to create clear boundaries with his mom if she's going to stay involved.
