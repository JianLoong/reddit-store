She didn't tell me when my daughter was born.. no.. she only told me when my daughter was 1 year old!! \nThis and other circumstances led to me not wanting anything to do with her or my daughter. \nOf course I will pay child support, but she didn't give me any chance to bond with her. \n\nWell, my mother LOVES children and immediately got in contact with the mother and met the child.\nThey've been very close and meeting regularly. \nI have no problem with that AT ALL. I just don't wanna meet her myself. \n\nOkay so now to the story: \nMy mom broke her foot and needs help at home, so I 'moved' back in to support her. \nI helped her with her cats, with food and household stuff. \n\nA few days ago I met with a friend and came home very late and slept until 1PM when I was woken up by some voices coming out of my moms bedroom. Mind you, she doesnt have a door and I'm sleeping in the living room, also without a door. \nSo I listened to the voices and it really was the mother and my child. I didn't wanna meet them, see them, hear them or whatever. I was so mad that my mom would do this to me without waking me up so I can leave... \n\nI just got up and left the house. Later that day I got an angry text from my mom AND my grandma saying I'm a horrible son for just leaving. My grandma said some hurtful stuff about me being like my father. \n\nI'm so confused right now... am I really the asshole for just leaving because she invited two people I didn't wanna see?\n\nEDIT: \n\nLet me clear up a few things:\n\n- Yes we used protection \n- I'm not 100% sure about my choice, I just need more time... I get that my daughter is here NOW but I need more time to prepare myself as I didnt get 9 months like the Mother of my child\n- my father was in my life but was a shitty dad and thats why I don't wanna rush a decision ( I think it would be better for daughter to not have me present instead of me not being good enough for her) \n- I slept so long because I was TALKING to my friend for so long... not drinking or stuff like that..

And yeah some people really dislike strangers in the house, or sometimes if there\u2019s a specific person they want to avoid, both of which are 100% valid. So that\u2019s why if you are sharing living space w someone you tell them in advance if you know you are gonna have someone over that they do not want to be around, and if there\u2019s a personal connection you\u2019d at least ask.", "I will repeat myself: the excuse DOES NOT MATTER.

Get over it they are allowed to have guests.\n\nNo lmao, you don't invite people into your shared home before at least notifying your roommates. That's just common sense. I personally think notifying isn't enough either, you ask your roommate, if they say no you don't get to have guests. This is their living space as well.\n\n(When I was a teen, mom invited some people she knew from the internet to spend a night because they ended up in our city with no place to stay overnight.

She\u2019s trying to force her sons hand, because most likely without the kid right there in front of his face he\u2019d just ignore the whole situation and this makes it a lot more real. \n\nThe solution isn\u2019t a surprise ambush though.

Instead just one day, bam he's the father to a one year old. That's extremely overwhelming. Could you imagine if someone knocked on your door right now with a one year old and proof it was yours and was just like, it's yours do you want to be in it's life?

It already seems he is already just providing the minimal legal requirement. The fact is, he is a father not because a woman did not choose a medical procedure to terminate her pregnancy, he is a father because he got someone else pregnant. If you put someone into a position like that you can't whine about the outcome, especially if you don't even have to be more involved other than providing financial compensation. I am saying this because this narrative of women not having abortions being selfish is honestly oppositional of what bodily autonomy is all about. No one should have to feel pressured or be shamed about what decisions to make about their body because someone else, the person who got them into that position in the first place, does not like it. It is like being part of a car crash and expecting the other person to amputate rather than physical therapy because it is more financially convenient to you.
