She didn't tell me when my daughter was born.. no.. she only told me when my daughter was 1 year old!! \nThis and other circumstances led to me not wanting anything to do with her or my daughter. \nOf course I will pay child support, but she didn't give me any chance to bond with her. \n\nWell, my mother LOVES children and immediately got in contact with the mother and met the child.\nThey've been very close and meeting regularly. \nI have no problem with that AT ALL. I just don't wanna meet her myself. \n\nOkay so now to the story: \nMy mom broke her foot and needs help at home, so I 'moved' back in to support her. \nI helped her with her cats, with food and household stuff. \n\nA few days ago I met with a friend and came home very late and slept until 1PM when I was woken up by some voices coming out of my moms bedroom. Mind you, she doesnt have a door and I'm sleeping in the living room, also without a door. \nSo I listened to the voices and it really was the mother and my child. I didn't wanna meet them, see them, hear them or whatever. I was so mad that my mom would do this to me without waking me up so I can leave... \n\nI just got up and left the house. Later that day I got an angry text from my mom AND my grandma saying I'm a horrible son for just leaving. My grandma said some hurtful stuff about me being like my father. \n\nI'm so confused right now... am I really the asshole for just leaving because she invited two people I didn't wanna see?\n\nEDIT: \n\nLet me clear up a few things:\n\n- Yes we used protection \n- I'm not 100% sure about my choice, I just need more time... I get that my daughter is here NOW but I need more time to prepare myself as I didnt get 9 months like the Mother of my child\n- my father was in my life but was a shitty dad and thats why I don't wanna rush a decision ( I think it would be better for daughter to not have me present instead of me not being good enough for her) \n- I slept so long because I was TALKING to my friend for so long... not drinking or stuff like that..

In any case there are more parents that want to adopt infants than actual infants available for such things (at least in the us which is where I am). And also I think the idea that parents only become parents due to their biology reacting to the birth of their child is not true in most cases. Especially for the dad, because sometimes the person doesn\u2019t even know so how is their biology supposed to know as well? And also being someone\u2019s biological parent is obviously not enough to make it so that the parent would have the capacity to parent well, there are many examples of that out there. Sure the basic roots of someone\u2019s capability to be able to parent in the first place or even just exist in society is going to be influenced by their biology, but the actual parenting part is often more based on social constructs and beliefs, etc., by the end of it all.
