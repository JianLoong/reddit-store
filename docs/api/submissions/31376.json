Since we were children, my brother has always had the bad habit of bossing me around, asking me to do the cleaning for him, and belittling my academic achievements. To support this attitude of his, my mother (68F) always stressed that \"a good girl should know how to clean and cook\" and that, therefore, \"it would come in handy for me.\"\n\nWe come to the present day.My brother has a wife (45F) he treats like a half-service woman. She is a stay-at-home mom, and I hope it is her choice; what I find objectionable is his ability to criticise anything. From what she cooks to how she irons her shirts.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, at the last Sunday lunch, my sister-in-law brought a cake she made. It could have been better. I can say that. But I ate my slice and complimented her so she wouldn't be disappointed because she had put time and effort into it anyway. My brother chuckled and said I was lying because the cake was pretty bad, and my mother added her own by saying that my sister-in-law can't bake, cook, clean, or iron, so she hadn't been \"a great buy.\" My father kept quiet by \"not taking sides\", but it bothered me. So I told my mother it wasn't funny and I liked the cake anyway. At that point, my mother said it's not like I understood much about it anyway and that I wasn't married because my ex was farsighted. They added that, unfortunately, from a career standpoint, it's not like he's done this much. My brother chuckled while my father and sister-in-law kept quiet, and I was about to throw in the towel, too. However, my mother put the load down by recommending that my brother send his daughter (age 5) to visit her more often so she could teach her how to clean and cook. My brother said he hoped the child would not be as hard-headed as me and his wife. At this point, I decided to stand up and say that Sunday lunch could end there for me because I would not stay and be offended and that the dishes to be washed could be done by my mother alone like a good housewife.\n\nMy mother, brother, and even my father, but not my sister-in-law (nor my nephew, who was taking a nap and didn't hear any of this), became heated and said that I was too touchy. I said that I was, yes, touchy but also very disappointed to see that male chauvinism was ultimately the fault of us women, especially mothers like her who raised such men.\n\nOver the next few days, I was flooded with messages asking me to apologise to my mother for what I said. I didn\u2019t answer. But I feel like I should apologise since it was disrespectful.\n\nAITA?\n\nP.S. I wasn't talking about all mothers. I was probably wrong to generalise in the post title.

Just because he chose a more passive route doesn't absolve him. He could've spoken up at any point, but didn't. Also, it sounds like your brother might be abusing his spouse, so it might not be wise to directly confront his shitty behavior towards her like you did. It could make things much worse for her at home. I'd suggest reading up on emotional abuse before confronting him again so you can better navigate the issue. \n\nIf I were you, I'd apologize to your mom for blaming her for your brother's serious faults and instead say that you should've simply criticized her for her treatment of SIL and the sexist she raised both of you. \n\nThe main thing here is to assign the correct amount of blame to your brother alone, and not shift it to women as a whole.", "[deleted]", "YTA, going by the title of this post.

I've been disappointed from them so many times already.", "Hope so", "Hope so... but talking was enough or really made things worse. That's another whole point comments made me thing about. Thanks anyway for your support", "Thanks", "I hope so too", "Yep. Me too... that's what was kind of the breaking point.", "Thanks", "Yep, No more Sunday lunches for me for a while", "Thanks", "Sorry, didn't really mean all mothers... but I take blame for generalising and not weighting my words.", "Sometimes to try is so important", "Thanks", "And having her judge my place? No thanks. Last time she was over she criticised even the brands of soap I buy.", "I know what you mean... I'm really sorry for generalising.", "Thanks", "Thanks", "It is and probably part of my response is probably due to resentment for what I have experienced over the years every time I wasn't up to her standards", "Your father doesn\u2019t get a pass here. He raised a misogynistic son as well.", "Alone? Like his wife didn't bear the children or do all the work of raising them? What BS.", "I can\u2019t believe your mother referred to her as \u201cnot a great buy\u201d as if she\u2019s an object for sale. I feel so sad for your SIL.", "The disrespect came from your mother and brother! Have they apologized to you for being disrespectful?? \nYou spoke the truth and you should never have to apologize for that! Stay strong\u2026you feel better for it! NTA", "I know, I've tried defending her but I've not been very good at it", "Exactly. He is capable! He can make the damn cake.", "You showed your SIL the solidarity she needed. You showed it to yourself and inner child too. I totally get why she would have kept quiet at her MILs table but I'm also sure she has a lot of respect for what you did (defend her and her work)", "Being disappointed in the lack of solidarity is one thing. Blaming mothers in general for chauvinism is quite another.", "Are you r parents happy with their arrangement?", "I used to think it was outdated but these days I\u2019m questioning the prevalence", "I get what you mean because my mother was this kind of mother. She pedastalled my brother to the level of emotional incest and I was the scapegoated girl who cared for my disabled father and my far younger brothers.\n\nAn uncomfortable part of my recovery has been owning the part I played in continuing to victimise myself in matyr-caregiver role as an adult out of habit because it felt familiar.", "Small wonder she thinks her way of life is the best/only one for women. She\u2019s been richly rewarded for fitting so well into the Happy Housewife role, and she has no other frame of reference. Why would she willingly risk those sweet, sweet head-pats by holding her husband and son accountable for their shortcomings?", "You got up and left, you called her out, I mixed up who they were insulting, I sincerely apologize, but I am proud of you for speaking up all the same, and your sweet sister in law probably needed someone to stand up for her.  Good for you!  I edited my first post to correct my error.", "Absent fathers teach chauvinism and entitlement you know?", "It's so good you care about your SIL. And honestly, you don't seem like an asshole generally. That one comment just irked me b/c we so often blame women for what men do. (But your mom is definitely a piece of work and deserves blame for own shit 100%)", "Sorry\u2026 40. And honestly you don\u2019t look a day over 35", "Just be there for her when she decides to leave. If you think your brother would turn violent, help her with an escape plan. Mainly, let her know she's not alone.", "That\u2019s great. Her confidence probably has gone so low that she\u2019s more scared than anything - sign of abuse - may not be physical but verbal is just as much debilitating. Where I live the YWCA has an excellent program for supporting women, even provide housing for single mothers in cooperation with the City and charity groups. Good luck. More power for you.", "Yes it is. If they ended up being chauvinistic assholes it won\u2019t be her fault. She also treated my sister and I the same as her kids. Also she had no medical training that I know of, my mom was an RN. I have a lung that the lower lobe has collapsed. I used to not tell my mom until it was collapsed, but my stepmom noticed and stopped it before it collapsed. My mother should have been able to tell that between her training and familiarity with my symptoms. But stepmom seemed to care more than my actual mom. I think she was all around a very good, albeit distant influence on me. I still keep in touch with her even though her and my dad split up.", "Yep. He did.", "Yep, I do agree with you. But according to her he must be \"helped\" and kind of pitied because he is the \"breadwinner\", he works and so brings his paycheck at home. That's another time I really quarrelled with them. Truth is this argument was not the first one I had", "Me too", "Thanks", "I don't think he even knows how to butter his own toast in the morning.", "I really hope so. Some comments rightfully made me think that maybe I wronged her too putting her on the spot. I really hope that's not the case and maybe I should try to reach out to her to make sure everything is fine on her part.", "Internalized misogyny\nMisogyny is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against women or girls. Women who experience internalized misogyny may express it through minimizing the value of women, mistrusting women, and showing gender bias in favor of men.", "I really don't know", "Yes, I see comeback of these attitudes.", "I've to say me too. That's also why I kind of blurted out that.", "I'm sorry you had to go through this and I hope things are better now.  \n\n\nWhat is certain from reading the first comments is that I should probably contact (privately and without letting anybody know) at least my sister-in-law to make sure that I haven't caused her too many problems since she has no fault in being involved in our terrible family.", "I\u2019m so sorry you went through that!", "You're probably right", "Oh, sorry. I received some sarcastic comments and I was afraid it was one of those.", "Yes I know", "No, I know what you mean... and I probably should have worded better and \"blaming her\" not \"mothers like her\" because I'm pretty sure that there are a lot of mothers who are wonderful and so on...   \n\n\nI probably really tried to hurt my mother since she has always identified herself with what for her is the ideal woman, whose main characteristic is being a mother.", "\ud83e\udd23 I know... I'm kind of an asshole for pointing that out. Sorry.", "Thanks for the suggestion", "Yep I'm pretty certain that the abuse is not physical (and anyways I'm keeping my eyes open) but as you said verbal abuse is such as much debilitating.", "<<<My father kept quiet by not taking sides>>> \n\nHis silence was taking sides with your brother.", "Which I mean, that's pathetic tbh.", "I would even go so far as to give her some information on emotional abuse in relationships (links to reading or help and support) and point out strongly that your brothers behaviour is not ok. It\u2019s textbook domestically abusive behaviour and the fact your mother piles on makes it even worse, and makes it harder for SIL to see that this is unacceptable. If that\u2019s what he is like towards her in front of people what\u2019s he like when they\u2019re alone? She shouldn\u2019t be in that relationship. Their poor little girl growing up thinking this is normal.", ">Yes, I see comeback of these attitudes.\n\nThat really worries me", "\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc90", "Totally agree... sorry I was being a bit sarcastic but I forgot to put it in \"quotes\" to let it be more clear.", "Yup and when she spoke up he finally chose to break the silence and defend the others.", "He is."]}
