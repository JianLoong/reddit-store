Some are basically country clubs.", "Sometimes people are, sometimes they are new and looking for friends and community and if that's your community you invite them. It's no different from inviting them to your book club or card game or to join your yoga class or soccer group.\n\nHowever, people are free to say no thanks and if you are a nice person who is interested in the actual person vs filling a pew or proselytizing then you'll be cool with it and invite them to dinner and a movie instead.", "Because they think they\u2019re \u201csaving your soul\u201d from eternal damnation. If you don\u2019t believe in god you go to hell. If you go to hell you don\u2019t go to Heaven, and because that\u2019s where you\u2019re supposed to want to go  \u201csaving\u201d somebody from hell gets you brownie points. Religion isn\u2019t about caring for other people or helping each other or community values. It\u2019s about harvesting souls for god. \n\nIt\u2019s why the anti abortion people are the same people who vote against universal healthcare and free school lunches. As long as that soul is brought into existence it doesn\u2019t matter how shit their life is, as long as they have the chance to be \u201csaved\u201d. Fuck their education, screw their health, and who cares if they get molested by the priest? If they\u2019re uneducated they won\u2019t think critically about what\u2019s happening, if they\u2019re not healthy they\u2019ll turn to god for healing, and if they die at least their soul was saved. And as for the priest, well. He does more to bring souls to god than anyone else, so just shuffle him off to a group of unsuspecting victims over and over.", "Nah, Chief Bottle Washer means that you do the majority of the household dishes, it's meant as an ironic thing when referring to males, rather than a sexist thing when referring to females.", "This isn\u2019t a debate platform.", "I use Youtube for learning cooking techniques.", "Be on the lookout?", "Be On the Look Out", "Be On the Lookout.

A murderous brute with glowing red eyes?", "yeah, I\u2019ve more or less always been an atheist and when I was 18/19 I actively sought out a bunch of different worship services just out of curiosity. A powerful experience on mushrooms made me intensely interested in religion even as an outside observer. \n\nHindus had the best food, Buddhists were the toughest, and Unitarian Universalists were the most progressive. (I went to the UU service shortly after my mom\u2019s death and the speaker that day happened to be a death doula. I wept silently the whole time and apparently everyone noticed, which was embarrassing, but they were really supportive.) There was a time in my life when I would have been excited to go to any kind of religious service just because I was very curious about something that could make people feel so strongly.  \n\nOf course, if the invite was from someone who was already subtly shaming me for not being wife material I would probably take it differently. In context the invite from a coworker is really uncomfortable and puts pressure on OP. \n\nWhen my grandmother invites me to church the one time a year I see her, I happily go and I enjoy doing it. But she also doesn\u2019t make me feel like a sinner who *must go to church*, which I think is the bigger issue here. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join me at church if you\u2019re ever interested\u201d vs \u201cYou\u2019re performing gender wrong, also come to church with me this Sunday\u201d are two very different kinds of invites lol", "If they express their desire to go to a church - then sure, it's reasonable, otherwise an invite out of the blue is kinda weird ngl", "For most atheist it would go against their core values. Not much different than asking a Christian to pray to Allah.\nMost Christians would find such a request quite insulting. And vice versa. I hope you see my point", "For every person willing to take you up on the invitation, how many do you think you put off just by asking?
