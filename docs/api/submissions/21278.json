Saying no is 100% fine. You do not owe her an explanation. \u201cThanks for thinking of me but that\u2019s not something I\u2019m interested in.\u201d is more than enough. If she presses, which she probably will, tell her that religious beliefs are personal\u2014which they are, including not having them\u2014and you don\u2019t discuss them. You have to set a firm boundary, because Evangelical types will often try to push past them.", "YWNBTA\n\n\"Thank you for the invitation, however I'm not interested in attending church.\"  No further explanation needed.\n\nIf she's a decent person, she'll accept that with grace and back off.  Love bombing people in the beginning is a common tactic, so don't feel obligated just because she's been nice.\n\nAlso, that bullshit about you needing to cook to snag a husband sounds very fundy.  Not a typo. (as in fundamentalist).", "NTA. Of course not. She sounds extremely pushy, and her attitudes regarding human relationships are stuck somewhere in the last century.\n\n*just saying no feels rude...  I feel like I have to accept her invitation.*\n\nNo, you don't. You don't have to agree to anything she offers, **nor do you need to give a reason.** When you give reasons to people for something you don't want to do, they'll just take it as an opportunity to argue with you. As the saying goes, \"No\" is a complete sentence.\n\n*I feel like all my other coworkers would look down on me if I don't go to church.*\n\nYeah, maybe they will. I'm an atheist too, and queer, and I'm sure many of the people I've worked with over the years think I'm going to burn in hell.\n\nBut here's the good news: **you don't need to worry about what they think of you privately**, as long as you are polite to them, they are polite to you, you all focus on getting the job done, and it's a friendly and harmonious atmosphere.\n\nIf they actually come out and **say** things directly to you which indicate that they look down on you, or if you discover they are saying those things about you to each other - well, depending on which country you live in, and what your local workplace relations laws are, it could be illegal. Where I live, it is illegal to discriminate against anyone in the workplace on the basis of religion (and many other things), or to create a hostile atmosphere for them.\n\nEvery time this woman asks you to do something you don't want to do, give her a friendly smile and \"No, thank you.\" Every time she asks you a personal question, such as why you don't go to church, give her another friendly smile and say \"That's a personal question. I prefer to keep my personal life separate from my work.\"\n\nBasically, do whatever it takes to shut her down, without being rude. As long as you are not rude, she has no way of retaliating without getting herself into trouble.", "No, don\u2019t give in to peer pressure, especially religious shit where you\u2019ll end up being expected to contribute financially.", "NTA\n\nThis coworker is not your friend.  Personally I would see this religious pressure as extremely inappropriate and her comments about \"learning to cook to get a husband\" crossing a line into harassment.  \n\nGrow a backbone and say No.  Be direct.  Be clear.  Be honest.  Say No.  If this person get's offended, report them to HR for harassment.", "NTA. She sounds extremely pushy. Just refuse, if she gets into the whole \u201cbut you need to believe in god\u201d spiei, just tell her she is right, to give you time and then tell her youre jewish or muslim now.", "YWNBTA for declining this inappropriate and unsolicited invitation. I would simply say thank you for the invitation, but I am already comfortable with my own personal beliefs. In time this will get easier. You do not owe pushy Christians your time or fake interest.", "NTA. All you have to say is, \"No, thank you.\" No excuses, no justifications, no nothing. \n\nI would distance myself from this woman. She is spouting nonsense about you learning to cook, makes fun of you for BF cooking, and is judging you for being an atheist (she looked horrified...). Now she is trying to get you into her religion. She is showing her nature.\n\nAll she needs is a no. If she refuses to back down, I hope the company has an HR. You have a right to not be harassed for your religious (or lack of in this case) choices.", "I\u2019m a Christian. I invite people to church often. YWNBTA. \n\n\u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m not interested.\u201d Is all you need to say.", "Just say no, an easy enough word.\n\nYou don't owe her anything, there is nothing to \"feel bad\" about.", "NTA. \"No thanks. I'm not interested.\"", "**NTA**\n\nPolitely decline. And get out and meet some new people. Go to community events that seem fun, take a class, find a book club or gaming group, whatever you're into. It's hard being alone in a new place. \n\nAlso, the ability to cook is a good quality in a partner, WTAF sexist bullshit is that.", "NTA. She's being pushy and trying to convert you", "NTA. She sounds like she is a member of some fundamentalist or cult type of church, I'd be steering well clear. If she continues to ask reply that you'll go to the church...for her funeral.", "NTA, all you have to do is decline politely. No deep explanations needed. \"Thanks, but it's not really my thing. But I appreciate the offer\". If she accepts your refusal gracefully, fabulous. \n\nIf she is still friendly at work then you can consider her friendship to be genuine. If she starts to pull back and be colder, then sadly her original friendly gestures were not genuine but more like recruiting. \n\nYour coworkers probably don't care about your weekend/Sunday life.  No need to be concerned about their feelings.", "NTA\n\nBe honest, tell her that you respect her religious freedom, and she needs to pass on the same courtesy. You're appreciative, but you are not comfortable. \n\nShe seems like shes stuck in an old mentality, you won't get far trying to prove a poiint.", "Ywnbta, It's your life. you don't have to go to other people's religious gatherings if you don't want to", "NTA. Learn to say no. It's a great life skill.", "NTA - it's not like church was brought up in normal conversation. It's not like you mentioned you're looking for one. She asked you which one you attend without knowing your religious background, which honestly makes her TA. Don't go, politely decline. If she treats you differently because of it, then you've been shown her true colors.", "Ywnbta. Being rude to cultists keeps you safe.", "Go to HR if she persists or starts treating you differently when you say no.   Your workplace is not her recruitment centre.", "Just say \u201c No thank you! I appreciate it though\u201d", "NAH. Just say no. There\u2019s no need to overthink this so much.", "As a Christian, absolutely NTA. You shouldn\u2019t even have to make an excuse. \n\n\u201cI really appreciate the offer and for you thinking about including me in something so important in your life, but that\u2019s really not my cup of tea and it would be uncomfortable for me. I respect what you believe in and am glad it brings you so much joy. It\u2019s just not my thing. Would love to do something together tho! Wanna maybe grab lunch this weekend?\u201d \n\nSomething along those lines should work with any reasonable person. If they get pissy at that, then that\u2019s on them.\n\nTbh she sounds like a bit of an ass. Demeaning you that you don\u2019t cook. My dad both cooks (he loves to cook, it\u2019s his passion) and is the breadwinner, but I\u2019ll be damned if I say say my mom didn\u2019t do her fucking job raising me and my 2 brothers. She helped us with school, kept the house in order, drove us to where we needed to be, was in charge of making sure we were healthy and happy. I love my mom and think she\u2019s the greatest mom in the world. We would be absolutely screwed without her. All of her children have successful jobs (I\u2019m still in Med school) and are doing fairly well and my dad will admit himself that she\u2019s the one who really guided us there. Don\u2019t ever feel like less of a person because you don\u2019t fucking cook. We ain\u2019t in the 50s.

While I\u2019m not overly religious, I have off and on gone to some church functions (community thanksgiving, Christmas, etc) on invites from friends or coworkers and depending on the church, they haven\u2019t been overly pushy, especially the non-denomination/\u201cmodern\u201d services. Also, the above types of churches are starting to be more friendly/less judgy towards those with alternative beliefs/lifestyles.

Based on experience, it's not a good idea to tell people that you're an atheist especially if they're the very religious types. They think that atheist means you can easily be recruited since you don't belong to a religion. Next time if people ask just tell them that you don't want to discuss your beliefs.", "\"I appreciate the offer, but church isn't for me. If you'd like to go get coffee after your service, I'd love to meet up!\" I don't care what anyone believes, that's their right. But they don't get to determine what I do.

It doesn't matter if people are nice to you, it is never rude to turn down an invitation because you're not interested. That's a perfectly valid reason. It's attitudes like this that can lead to you allowing people to walk all over you just because you want to be nice. That's not what this lady is doing yet but it could easily happened in the future.

Boundaries, and friendships with non believers, mean nothing. \n\nIf this happens, keep it polite and keep it about work from then on. \n\nAnd if you want to learn how to cook, I\u2019m sure your partner would be happy to teach you some basics\u2026 if not, there\u2019s always cooking classes, which are another great way to make friends.\n\nNTA", "Heh, she'd loose her shit about my relationship with my partner.
