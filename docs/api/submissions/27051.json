I believe there are reasons why people can't find dates their own age and short of it being a small town with less than a dozen youngsters across the board there's no excuse for the borderline nonsery,\n\nSecondly, who makes a joke about cheating on their partner (let alone TO their partner) she has serious social complex that needs to be addressed especially because she only admitted the lie and responcibility when she found out other people weren't happy about the joke.\n\nAll in all you're not the jerk but you may want to consider that your brother is not inherintely innocent in this relationship either", "She sounds a but crazy in no way is that a funny joke", "NTA.
