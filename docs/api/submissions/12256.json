For anyone not keeping track, the 90's was 30 years ago. A LOT HAS CHANGED. Not your fault they were stubborn and ignorant.", "NTA and also LOL, maybe this is the path to a better in-law visit for me.  You warned them and your wife also knew.  Even if they thought they knew better and wanted more, they could have started with a smaller piece and had more rather than just having a full piece up front.", "If they knew they were medicated, NTA.", "If you told them how strong they were and they still ate as much as they did, NTA. that\u2019s how edibles work, you can\u2019t control their highs.", "Nta. \n\nYou told them ebay should have been taken, and they were too good to listen to you. 100% their fault.", "NTA - you gave them a warning, and they chose to ignore it. That is on them. Not you.", "Definitely NTA\nI would still be laughing at them \ud83d\ude02", "Nta. That is basically them basically forgetting how many oops they have had in their youth. They are just mad they didn't listen", "NTA. You warned them AND as far as this story tells, you didn't even seem to mind that they stayed at your house all weekend.", "The in-laws have the same sore loser vibe as the show-offs you meet at a bar, who brag about how they can drink everyone under the table, and then fall over after a tiny negroni sbagliato with prosecco. \n\nNTA Mmmm magic brownies, you could never be the asshole", "NTA. You warned them. They are adults and have to take responsibility for their choices. It's not like you gave it to them without letting them know.", "NTA\n\nHow in the world can anyone think **you** are the AH here?  You **TOLD** them to try a quarter of your fudge pieces.  They are adults and decided to each have a full piece.\n\nWhat were you supposed to do?  Snatch it out of their hands?  Argue with them over it?  If you did either of those two, everyone would think you're the AH for doing that.  \n\nDo your wife and in-laws **like** making you the AH or something?", "NTA...nobody was tricked. You made a recommendation that they ignored. Hopefully everyone will have a sense of humour about it later.", "NTA. You warned them. Cannabis has gotten much stronger over the recent decades, and anyway it's pretty childish (or arrogant) to try to play so cool and take that much.", "NTA do these people need you pull out a box of crayons?", "NTA, people should learn to listen to advice. I'm a chili head and I can handle spicy fairly well. People that know me also learned the hard way to heed my warnings.", "Nta. Buy a lock for the medicine cabinet, you don't want the in-laws to end up in the hospital because they are worse than my 7 yr old at following simple instructions.", "Nta at all, you did warn them", "NTA- They were warned. I would have driven them home and let them sit on their own couch :-)", "NTA at all, you warned them and they deliberately took more than the recommended amount.", "NTA. They asked for it, literally. Trying your edibles was their idea. Ignoring your suggested dose was their idea. All you did was share. Would it have been your fault if they decided to drink a fifth of tequila instead of having just one margarita? No. They're adults. They're responsible for their own fuckups, er, actions.", "NTA and someone under estimated their immunity and fell flat on their face. Looks like their ego couldn't take the hit. How in the world was it ever your fault? What were you supposed to do, take it off them? Your wife is pretty much the A along with your ILs", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
