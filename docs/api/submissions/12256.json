Next time, hide them or cut them two quarter sized ones and put out while hiding the rest.  \n\nThat happened to me once when my oldest son made a special brownies.  I used to make my special brownies which were nothing to compare to my son's.  My son made it.  He warned me to take only half or quarter of it.  Did I?  Nope, like your in laws, I took a whole.  I was on a very bad trip because the room spun non stop all night long.  LOL  That's why I get your in laws being gung ho on that and managed to fuck up.  As for my special brownies, I spent the weekend including my first day of my new job being high as a kite because I ate about four while my brother and his friends ate the rest except leaving one for my late husband who was my boyfriend then.  He was soo pissed because he wanted more.   And we went to his parents' for dinner with his older brother and wife.  Shit, it was baaaad idea.  I had no idea that I was invited to the dinner until the DAY!  His brother nudged my husband and asked if I was high.  He nodded and whispered special brownies.  On my first day of my new job it started to subside, thank goodness but still little high and managed to look straight.  LOL", "NTA\n\nYou told them. Anyone who knows edibles know you never, ever have \"more\" you have the suggested amount.", "NTA.\n\nNope, anyone saying otherwise is wrong - they are grown, consenting adults who ignored your advice and warnings about the dosage.

YOU said it. They don't get to blame you because their more-than-grown selves decided not to listen. This is not on you and ALL of them owe you an apology.", "NTA. Also, if they hadn't done any recently they were going to get screwed either way. Doesnt matter what their tolerance level was 20+ years ago with their bathtub weed.

Don't get me wrong, them way more than you, but I'm not fully convinced you did your due diligence in warning them of just how strong the fudge was. I'm not saying you had to cause a whole ordeal, but I think generally giving your recommendation based on what your wife typically has, isn't quite sufficient given that weed has changed significantly in potency in the past 30 some years. If you explained all that, reiterated your recommendation, suggested that if they start with 1/4, and if it's not enough, they can take more in a couple hours, Then I would say you're n.t.a even if they insisted and ultimately went through with taking a whole fudge piece.
