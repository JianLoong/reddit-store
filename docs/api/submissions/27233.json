We (but mostly I) have been planning this for months. \n\nBack in March, I told him I would plan most of it, where to go, and what to do, all he has to do was make sure he had the week off and buy the plane tickets. I spent the last few months researching what to do. I booked the hotel room, made reservations at places we wanted to try, I made a list of all the sites I wanted to see. \n\nEvery few weeks, I would check in with my husband to see if he had asked off and bought the tickets yet, he would say he was waiting for the plane ticket prices to go down. Three weeks ago, I reminded him again and he said he had got off of work for the days but had forgotten to get the tickets. He looked online and the tickets were close to $1500/ticket. He said he was going to wait some more to see if they would go down. \n\nLast week, I asked if he had bought them yet and he said no. We looked again and the prices were still high. He said he wasn't willing to spend that much on them and asked how much money I would lose if I just canceled everything instead. He offered to have a nice staycation instead. I told him I was not willing to cancel everything because I spent so much time planning it. We argued and we didn't come to a conclusion. I wound up buying just one ticket for myself and when i flew out Saturday, I told him I was still going and he acted all surprised that I didn't want to stay home with him. \n\nI am in New Orleans now and he is blowing up my phone saying that I am an AH for still going without him. He was trying to get a ticket to come too but I told him if he came, he is getting his own hotel room because this is now my vacation away from him.

We also take vacations together.  It works well for us.  We appreciate each other all the more after a few weeks to a month or more apart.", "NTA. He literally had 2 tasks and plenty of time to complete them, plus reminders. I\u2019d honestly be irritated that he dropped the ball and then didn\u2019t own up to it by buying the tickets at the high price. Consider that a procrastination tax and a lesson.", "NTA\n\nThat was weaponized incompetence trying to manipulate you into canceling the vacation because he didn't want to go.\n\nGood on you for going anyway and not playing his passive aggressive bullshit game", "NTA. I get waiting to see if prices drop and I get forgetting about it. However, you had put so much work into this trip. Hours of research and anticipation. You did everything you could expect but the tickets. You need to have a serious concern with him.  \nSome points:\n1. You were trusting him with a big part and he let you down.\n2. You worked hard to plan and take as much responsibility for the trip as possible and his actions make it seem like\n  -Everything you did wasn\u2019t valuable. Your effort to make this trip; you feel undervalued \n3. The way he could dismiss the whole trip for a stay-cation ignores says that he thinks throwing you a little bone is all that\u2019s needed and you\u2019ll be placated.\n4. His unilateral decision that we stay home & no apology says he put more weight on his opinions and doesn\u2019t even consider you. \n\nIf this was due to not being to afford it because of bills : moneys tight right now he should apologized and takes actions to make it right.  He need to take those days and you go somewhere out of town, and start the conversation about how his actions show his little care. \nHe then needs to take action and show you that he\u2019s putting away funds immediately to ensure the trip you planned on happens. If that\u2019s taking cash every week and putting it into \u201cdream vacation\u201d envelope or something. \n\nWhen you get home ensure that he understands what his actions meant to you. Tell him that you are hurt how he could just \u201cwave away\u201d all your dedication and work. Ensure he understands you planned this because you will love him and cLue him.\nAsk him why he was able to, so quickly, make a choice like that. And tell him ti really think about it, let him sit and do the mental and emotional work then come to you so you two have really have this conversation.", "Has he never flown before?\n\nYou don't wait for flights to come down .. you buy the tickets ASAP before they go UP. Inevitably. Virtually always.\n\nAirline ticket prices are supply and demand, nothing else. When a trip is two months out, the planes are still booked as almost empty, the supplies high, and the cost is low. When the trip is 10 days away the planes are almost full, and the supply is short, ergo the price is high. This is the way it has always worked.\n\nNTA. Enjoy the Big Easy.", "NTA.\n\nHe had plenty of time to get the tickets. You asked and reminded. If he wasn't interested in going on this vacation, he could've told openly. I don't think you would've minded if he changed mind about the trip.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you have to cancel your vacation. You planned everything. Canceling everything is an expensive affair. More than the expense, it's the disappointment of not being able to enjoy the well earned vacation.\n\nI strongly feel that your hubby never wished to go on the trip and hoped that by pushing ticket purchases, suggesting canceling all the plans in the nth moment and proposing staycation will make u drop the plans. He's the AH.\n\nI'm so glad you decide to go. Enjoy the solo stay. Tell your hubby that you will discuss once you're back home. Ask him to enjoy his staycation simultaneously. Keep your mobile on silent and go on with your trip.\n\nOnce you go home, you need to have serious discussion with him.", "NTA. This literally happened to my husband and I for our Japan trip. I did all the planning and all he had to do was book the hotels. We were going during cherry blossom season so I knew things would fill up fast, so I reminded him a year before, six months before, and three months before. Guess who finally checked hotels a month before and found that everything was booked? The difference is, my husband didn\u2019t try and get me to cancel the trip. He ended up booking five-star hotels and ate the cost because it was 100% his fault that we couldn\u2019t get more reasonably priced accommodations. OP\u2019s husband should\u2019ve gotten the more expensive tickets and paid for the difference because it was his fault he waited so long to get his one task done.\n\nEdit: we weren\u2019t married at the time, so he wasn\u2019t using \u201cour\u201d money to pay for the five-star hotels.", "NTA.

No? That's what happened to that trip. \n\nHim? What's up with that trip to Victoria?\n\nMe: I have no idea. \n\nHe weaponized incompetence on the regular. He's an ex.

Pretty passive aggressive.", "He is either a procrastinator and leaves things to the last minute.

When the holiday is over sit down and TALK to him and get to the bottom of this.\n\n3 If he is ok with travel/holidays maybe he is just uninterested in them or resents spending the money. AGAIN you need to talk about this issue.\n\n3 Also maybe ask YOURSELF is he just avoiding playing \"happy families' with me?

BUT, I have to ask this, is this something that he really wanted to do as well? Or was it something that  was mostly you and he just went along with? You said you did all the planning, did you consult with him during this time?

Why would you plan everything but leave the ticket buying by far the most important part up to him?

Sounds like he didn't want to go on the trip and / or didn't want to spend the money so he thought he'd just not buy the tickets and he wouldn't have to deal with it. So, that is going to need to be sorted out when you get home. Interesting that you can afford the $1500 but he said he was unwilling to pay that much. \n\nI also see that you note that there was no conclusion on the ticket issue.

You are so brave.\n\nEdit: Verdict NTA", "NTA but can I offer a perspective here. This could be way off base but I wonder if he has been concerned about the cost of the trip and hasn't felt able to discuss this because he doesn't want to disappoint / upset you by advocating for scaling back the trip, and thought that a way to deal with it would be to not book the flights. (This was obviously not a good way to deal with it!)", "Why was he tasked with buying the tickets?  Just curious.  If this was a trip that you mostly wanted to take, it seems odd that you'd plan everything except the flight.", "Hot take: ESH (but biggest AH award goes to husband).\n\nIt sucks that you spent so much time and effort planning this trip and he didn\u2019t carry out his side. It sucks more that he dropped the ball. But, I\u2019m curious:\n1) did he actually want to go on this or is this was something only you pushed for, and did you listen to his reluctance earlier on and why he might not want to? Might hear the opinion that it doesn\u2019t matter, but it does depending on if you\u2019re making choices together or separately. If that\u2019s just how your marriage is, so be it and you\u2019re NTA. But if you guys try to work together, that move is just\u2026kind of shitty. In your shoes, I would\u2019ve bought both tickets (if you can afford it ofc) and told him that\u2019s the cost of delaying to buy them.\n2) Did you tell him you were taking it regardless of his reluctance?

I mean maybe he was a slacker but to just take off without telling him then go as far as to say he can get his own toom if he comes. My response would be you can do the same when you get home then. Sounds like this couple isnt communicating very well at some point they should have agreed to wait to said date and if prices didnt drop buy two tickets he or she could have done it i travel a ton and it only takes minutes to book a flight.", "NTA. \n\nBut I'm curious why you didn't just buy the tickets? I know it wasn't your job and your husband is still an AH, but if he was dragging his feet, you had every right to step in. \n\nAnyway, French street is better than Bourbon street.

We (but mostly I) have been planning this for months. \n\nBack in March, I told him I would plan most of it, where to go, and what to do, all he has to do was make sure he had the week off and buy the plane tickets. I spent the last few months researching what to do. I booked the hotel room, made reservations at places we wanted to try, I made a list of all the sites I wanted to see. \n\nEvery few weeks, I would check in with my husband to see if he had asked off and bought the tickets yet, he would say he was waiting for the plane ticket prices to go down. Three weeks ago, I reminded him again and he said he had got off of work for the days but had forgotten to get the tickets. He looked online and the tickets were close to $1500/ticket. He said he was going to wait some more to see if they would go down. \n\nLast week, I asked if he had bought them yet and he said no. We looked again and the prices were still high. He said he wasn't willing to spend that much on them and asked how much money I would lose if I just canceled everything instead. He offered to have a nice staycation instead. I told him I was not willing to cancel everything because I spent so much time planning it. We argued and we didn't come to a conclusion. I wound up buying just one ticket for myself and when i flew out Saturday, I told him I was still going and he acted all surprised that I didn't want to stay home with him. \n\nI am in New Orleans now and he is blowing up my phone saying that I am an AH for still going without him. He was trying to get a ticket to come too but I told him if he came, he is getting his own hotel room because this is now my vacation away from him.

When my(60M) gf(61F) moved in with me, we discussed our family backgrounds.  Her family came from Switzerland and my father\u2019s came from Italy.  So we talked about a trip to both countries.  I told her I would save for two years and we would take that trip.  Well, that got postponed for two more years due to injuries, but in 2018 I told her that the following year we are going.  \n\nI got my birth certificate and got ready to apply for a passport.  She kept putting off both finding her birth certificate and ordering a new one from the county she was born in.  I told her that I was going on this trip and that I really wanted her to be there with me.  I reminded her weekly, then daily, to the point where we argued over my daily reminders.  She just kept \u201cforgetting\u201d (???).  My passport came in but she still hadn\u2019t ordered a certificate. \n\nFinally, she placed an online order for her certificate and told me she should have it in a week or so.  Which if true would be the last minute for an expedited passport.  Yeah, right.  I called the county and they had a 7-week backlog.  True to their word, seven weeks later she received her certificate.  **The day before** our flight.  \n\nAbout 4 weeks before the flight I told her that there was no way she could get her passport, even with her certificate at that point.  But I could not get any money back by canceling our tickets and prepaid hotels.  I was going, damnit.  \n\nAnd I went.  And had a great trip, although not nearly as good as it should have been.

She kept on him about the plane tickets for weeks, so no, I don't think her mind was in 'healthy marriage mode' when her 'husband' is acting like a child and brushing her off. She was obviously excited about this vacation, he almost ruined it for her without actually trying to fix it, and she didn't want him to ruin it further. Yeah, she could have offered to get a ticket, but maybe she didn't want to do him that favor after his major fuck up. Maybe you don't think this'll change his behavior, but I think it might show him that she won't put up with his shit and if it doesn't then maybe he won't have a marriage at all anymore\n\nEdited to add judgment: NTA", "Or maybe he thought if he managed not to buy tickets till the last minute, OP would buy it anyway because she was so excited for the trip.

He clearly has a problem with your relationship that he's not bringing to the table *at all*, and that can be deeply frustrating. If you want to stay married, you'll need for him to find out why he wasn't thinking about the holiday, looking forward to it, seeing spending a week with you doing cool things as happy thoughts for him to drop into during stressful days and a reward.

It sounds like he was being price-conscious and decided the trip was out of your guys\u2019 budget. It sounds like he might the main earner and takes care of the finances while you spend your day planning expensive vacations that are out of the budget. Also, you could have just been the one to buy the plane tickets and the whole situation would have been avoided.\n\nHe took the time off of work and he was checking prices for weeks. It doesn\u2019t sound like he was trying to dodge the trip. He even offered an alternate trip since the one you planned was deemed too expensive. I don\u2019t know why you would book a hotel room without buying plane tickets at the same time, either.\n\nAlso, $1,500 should be considered a major purchase. You shouldn\u2019t have gone behind his back and spent that without telling him. You could have at least told him, or given him one last chance to opt in, or just bought 2 tickets anyway. This also shows you were capable of buying plane tickets to begin with.\n\nAdditionally, your planning doesn\u2019t disappear if you don\u2019t go on the trip. You could just go at a future date with the same plan when prices come down. So, the idea that you\u2019d be \u201cwasting\u201d all the time you spent planning the trip is nonsense. \n\nFinally, your last paragraph definitely proves that YTA here. Why would you be mad at him? You\u2019re the one who went behind his back. It\u2019s very antagonistic to tell your husband you don\u2019t want to be with him because he wants to join you.", "Both are the asshole\n\nJust get a divorce and be done with it. You wanted this trip obviously. You did not care about what he wanted at all. You planned where you wanted to go, no input from him. This vacation was solely your wants and you showed so.

Or is this your fat bag paying for everything in life so you can sit on your ass and act loke a queen B.\n\nHe should have told you what he wanted and maybe that wasn't a part of your post and done.

He would book the bargain rate for the whole season. Katrina killed that and Tulane killed the soccer program. Only went back for graduation.

In OP's shoes, I wouldn't have planned any of the vacation until my partner had booked the flights (with sufficient lead time), just in case ticket prices were out of budget for those specific dates. It's likely that flight prices went up since March, but they may well have been unreasonable even then.\n\nStill, it definitely seems like OP's husband was hoping the vacation plans would fall through or that OP would book and maybe pay for both flights.
