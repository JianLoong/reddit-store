We (but mostly I) have been planning this for months. \n\nBack in March, I told him I would plan most of it, where to go, and what to do, all he has to do was make sure he had the week off and buy the plane tickets. I spent the last few months researching what to do. I booked the hotel room, made reservations at places we wanted to try, I made a list of all the sites I wanted to see. \n\nEvery few weeks, I would check in with my husband to see if he had asked off and bought the tickets yet, he would say he was waiting for the plane ticket prices to go down. Three weeks ago, I reminded him again and he said he had got off of work for the days but had forgotten to get the tickets. He looked online and the tickets were close to $1500/ticket. He said he was going to wait some more to see if they would go down. \n\nLast week, I asked if he had bought them yet and he said no. We looked again and the prices were still high. He said he wasn't willing to spend that much on them and asked how much money I would lose if I just canceled everything instead. He offered to have a nice staycation instead. I told him I was not willing to cancel everything because I spent so much time planning it. We argued and we didn't come to a conclusion. I wound up buying just one ticket for myself and when i flew out Saturday, I told him I was still going and he acted all surprised that I didn't want to stay home with him. \n\nI am in New Orleans now and he is blowing up my phone saying that I am an AH for still going without him. He was trying to get a ticket to come too but I told him if he came, he is getting his own hotel room because this is now my vacation away from him.

I don\u2019t know if he deliberately sabotaged the trip or just didn\u2019t care enough to follow through on his tiny piece of things, but you were absolutely right to not let him ruin the trip for you, and be sure as hell shouldn\u2019t be booking an expensive plane ticket to come join you now. I hope he\u2019ll be ready with a massive apology when you get home.", "NTA.\nYour husband sounds like an ass.\n\nHubby and I have been taking independent vacations, including international ones for a quarter century.  We also take vacations together.  It works well for us.  We appreciate each other all the more after a few weeks to a month or more apart.", "NTA. He literally had 2 tasks and plenty of time to complete them, plus reminders. I\u2019d honestly be irritated that he dropped the ball and then didn\u2019t own up to it by buying the tickets at the high price. Consider that a procrastination tax and a lesson.", "NTA\n\nThat was weaponized incompetence trying to manipulate you into canceling the vacation because he didn't want to go.\n\nGood on you for going anyway and not playing his passive aggressive bullshit game", "NTA. I get waiting to see if prices drop and I get forgetting about it. However, you had put so much work into this trip. Hours of research and anticipation. You did everything you could expect but the tickets. You need to have a serious concern with him.  \nSome points:\n1. You were trusting him with a big part and he let you down.\n2. You worked hard to plan and take as much responsibility for the trip as possible and his actions make it seem like\n  -Everything you did wasn\u2019t valuable. Your effort to make this trip; you feel undervalued \n3. The way he could dismiss the whole trip for a stay-cation ignores says that he thinks throwing you a little bone is all that\u2019s needed and you\u2019ll be placated.\n4. His unilateral decision that we stay home & no apology says he put more weight on his opinions and doesn\u2019t even consider you. \n\nIf this was due to not being to afford it because of bills : moneys tight right now he should apologized and takes actions to make it right.  He need to take those days and you go somewhere out of town, and start the conversation about how his actions show his little care. \nHe then needs to take action and show you that he\u2019s putting away funds immediately to ensure the trip you planned on happens. If that\u2019s taking cash every week and putting it into \u201cdream vacation\u201d envelope or something. \n\nWhen you get home ensure that he understands what his actions meant to you. Tell him that you are hurt how he could just \u201cwave away\u201d all your dedication and work. Ensure he understands you planned this because you will love him and cLue him.\nAsk him why he was able to, so quickly, make a choice like that. And tell him ti really think about it, let him sit and do the mental and emotional work then come to you so you two have really have this conversation.", "Has he never flown before?\n\nYou don't wait for flights to come down .. you buy the tickets ASAP before they go UP. Inevitably. Virtually always.\n\nAirline ticket prices are supply and demand, nothing else. When a trip is two months out, the planes are still booked as almost empty, the supplies high, and the cost is low. When the trip is 10 days away the planes are almost full, and the supply is short, ergo the price is high. This is the way it has always worked.\n\nNTA. Enjoy the Big Easy.", "NTA.\n\nHe had plenty of time to get the tickets. You asked and reminded. If he wasn't interested in going on this vacation, he could've told openly. I don't think you would've minded if he changed mind about the trip.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you have to cancel your vacation. You planned everything. Canceling everything is an expensive affair. More than the expense, it's the disappointment of not being able to enjoy the well earned vacation.\n\nI strongly feel that your hubby never wished to go on the trip and hoped that by pushing ticket purchases, suggesting canceling all the plans in the nth moment and proposing staycation will make u drop the plans. He's the AH.\n\nI'm so glad you decide to go. Enjoy the solo stay. Tell your hubby that you will discuss once you're back home. Ask him to enjoy his staycation simultaneously. Keep your mobile on silent and go on with your trip.\n\nOnce you go home, you need to have serious discussion with him.", "NTA. This literally happened to my husband and I for our Japan trip. I did all the planning and all he had to do was book the hotels. We were going during cherry blossom season so I knew things would fill up fast, so I reminded him a year before, six months before, and three months before. Guess who finally checked hotels a month before and found that everything was booked? The difference is, my husband didn\u2019t try and get me to cancel the trip. He ended up booking five-star hotels and ate the cost because it was 100% his fault that we couldn\u2019t get more reasonably priced accommodations. OP\u2019s husband should\u2019ve gotten the more expensive tickets and paid for the difference because it was his fault he waited so long to get his one task done.", "NTA.

I want to get dates nailed down. \n\nHim: Oh, no, I'll do that. \n\nMr: Did you renew your passport? I have dates in mind and you need to do it now so you have it in time. \n\nHim: Oh no, I'll do that right away. \n\nMe: Did you send in your passport renewal so I can get this stuff booked?\n\nHim: I'll get right on it. \n\n...\n\nHim: Whatever happened to that trip?\n\nMe: Did you renew your passport? No? That's what happened to that trip. \n\nHim? What's up with that trip to Victoria?\n\nMe: I have no idea. \n\nHe weaponized incompetence on the regular. He's an ex.

He really let you down, it's almost like he didn't want to take this vacation so he sabotaged it. But even if he was merely being lazy, he was still being uncaring.

Pretty passive aggressive.", "He is either a procrastinator and leaves things to the last minute.

When the holiday is over sit down and TALK to him and get to the bottom of this.\n\n3 If he is ok with travel/holidays maybe he is just uninterested in them or resents spending the money. AGAIN you need to talk about this issue.\n\n3 Also maybe ask YOURSELF is he just avoiding playing \"happy families' with me?

Any doubts on this front check his social media , does it look \"single\"?", "There isn't enough information on the story, but I would go with YTA. \n\nWhen me and my wife plan a trip, the first thing we buy together are the plane tickets. The prices change according to the dates. While buying, we may decide to shift the dates a bit to get cheaper tickets.\n\nOnly after this we really know what will be the dates of the trip, and without that we can't book a hotel.\n\nUnless you are swimming on money, Us$ 1500 for each ticket is crazyness and you left no room for research because everything was already booked. \n\nI pay less than this for a roundtrip between Europe and Brazil.\n\nYTA.", "Divorce him", "NTA  Husband dropped the ball big time.

BUT, I have to ask this, is this something that he really wanted to do as well? Or was it something that  was mostly you and he just went along with? You said you did all the planning, did you consult with him during this time? I believe it is justified for you to go by yourself on such a trip, especially if he was not that involved in it from the beginning, but it would have saved you both from a huge argument, stress and anger if you had just communicated better and state clearly both of your expectations and desires.", "Nta and block him until you're back.  Generally you want to buy 1-2 months out.  That's typically a good place between getting a good price and having the assurance you have the tickets.

Why would you plan everything but leave the ticket buying by far the most important part up to him?

Sounds like he didn't want to go on the trip and / or didn't want to spend the money so he thought he'd just not buy the tickets and he wouldn't have to deal with it. So, that is going to need to be sorted out when you get home. Interesting that you can afford the $1500 but he said he was unwilling to pay that much. \n\nI also see that you note that there was no conclusion on the ticket issue.

You are so brave.\n\nEdit: Verdict NTA", "NTA but can I offer a perspective here. This could be way off base but I wonder if he has been concerned about the cost of the trip and hasn't felt able to discuss this because he doesn't want to disappoint / upset you by advocating for scaling back the trip, and thought that a way to deal with it would be to not book the flights. (This was obviously not a good way to deal with it!)", "Why was he tasked with buying the tickets?  Just curious.  If this was a trip that you mostly wanted to take, it seems odd that you'd plan everything except the flight.", "Hot take: ESH (but biggest AH award goes to husband).\n\nIt sucks that you spent so much time and effort planning this trip and he didn\u2019t carry out his side. It sucks more that he dropped the ball. But, I\u2019m curious:\n1) did he actually want to go on this or is this was something only you pushed for, and did you listen to his reluctance earlier on and why he might not want to? Might hear the opinion that it doesn\u2019t matter, but it does depending on if you\u2019re making choices together or separately. If that\u2019s just how your marriage is, so be it and you\u2019re NTA. But if you guys try to work together, that move is just\u2026kind of shitty. In your shoes, I would\u2019ve bought both tickets (if you can afford it ofc) and told him that\u2019s the cost of delaying to buy them.\n2) Did you tell him you were taking it regardless of his reluctance?

I mean maybe he was a slacker but to just take off without telling him then go as far as to say he can get his own toom if he comes. My response would be you can do the same when you get home then. Sounds like this couple isnt communicating very well at some point they should have agreed to wait to said date and if prices didnt drop buy two tickets he or she could have done it i travel a ton and it only takes minutes to book a flight.", "NTA. \n\nBut I'm curious why you didn't just buy the tickets? I know it wasn't your job and your husband is still an AH, but if he was dragging his feet, you had every right to step in. \n\nAnyway, French street is better than Bourbon street. The museums are fantastic. Food is fantastic. The culture is unique. I hope you have a great time!", "NTA\n\nexcept for the part where you told him you were not willing to share the room with him.

We (but mostly I) have been planning this for months. \n\nBack in March, I told him I would plan most of it, where to go, and what to do, all he has to do was make sure he had the week off and buy the plane tickets. I spent the last few months researching what to do. I booked the hotel room, made reservations at places we wanted to try, I made a list of all the sites I wanted to see. \n\nEvery few weeks, I would check in with my husband to see if he had asked off and bought the tickets yet, he would say he was waiting for the plane ticket prices to go down. Three weeks ago, I reminded him again and he said he had got off of work for the days but had forgotten to get the tickets. He looked online and the tickets were close to $1500/ticket. He said he was going to wait some more to see if they would go down. \n\nLast week, I asked if he had bought them yet and he said no. We looked again and the prices were still high. He said he wasn't willing to spend that much on them and asked how much money I would lose if I just canceled everything instead. He offered to have a nice staycation instead. I told him I was not willing to cancel everything because I spent so much time planning it. We argued and we didn't come to a conclusion. I wound up buying just one ticket for myself and when i flew out Saturday, I told him I was still going and he acted all surprised that I didn't want to stay home with him. \n\nI am in New Orleans now and he is blowing up my phone saying that I am an AH for still going without him. He was trying to get a ticket to come too but I told him if he came, he is getting his own hotel room because this is now my vacation away from him.

When my(60M) gf(61F) moved in with me, we discussed our family backgrounds.  Her family came from Switzerland and my father\u2019s came from Italy.  So we talked about a trip to both countries.  I told her I would save for two years and we would take that trip.  Well, that got postponed for two more years due to injuries, but in 2018 I told her that the following year we are going.  \n\nI got my birth certificate and got ready to apply for a passport.  She kept putting off both finding her birth certificate and ordering a new one from the county she was born in.  I told her that I was going on this trip and that I really wanted her to be there with me.  I reminded her weekly, then daily, to the point where we argued over my daily reminders.  She just kept \u201cforgetting\u201d (???).  My passport came in but she still hadn\u2019t ordered a certificate. \n\nFinally, she placed an online order for her certificate and told me she should have it in a week or so.  Which if true would be the last minute for an expedited passport.  Yeah, right.  I called the county and they had a 7-week backlog.  True to their word, seven weeks later she received her certificate.  **The day before** our flight.  \n\nAbout 4 weeks before the flight I told her that there was no way she could get her passport, even with her certificate at that point.  But I could not get any money back by canceling our tickets and prepaid hotels.  I was going, damnit.  \n\nAnd I went.  And had a great trip, although not nearly as good as it should have been.

He either wanted the OP to handle getting the tickets, and put it off and hoped that she would take over the task, or he didn\u2019t want to go on the trip but didn\u2019t want to be the bad guy by saying so.", "Not only that but you will be taking the few remaining seats and probably won't be sitting together.", "You're not actually that stupid to ask that question, are you?\n\nYOu have a one-sided report of a relationship issue. Sure, that person is 100% impartial and fair, not biased at all and is clearly telling us his side of the story.... Sure.", "For starters, the entire other side of the story?", "That's just plain unfair. She kept on him about the plane tickets for weeks, so no, I don't think her mind was in 'healthy marriage mode' when her 'husband' is acting like a child and brushing her off. She was obviously excited about this vacation, he almost ruined it for her without actually trying to fix it, and she didn't want him to ruin it further. Yeah, she could have offered to get a ticket, but maybe she didn't want to do him that favor after his major fuck up. Maybe you don't think this'll change his behavior, but I think it might show him that she won't put up with his shit and if it doesn't then maybe he won't have a marriage at all anymore\n\nEdited to add judgment: NTA", "Or maybe he thought if he managed not to buy tickets till the last minute, OP would buy it anyway because she was so excited for the trip. So he would get to enjoy the trip and not waste his money over the tickets.\nLooks like that backfired on him :p", "My Mom drilled into me at a young age that when you fail to plan you plan to fail. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fNTA OP He had ONE job which was to book the travel, he failed to do so. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Enjoy! I love New Orleans.", "Either that or he hoped OP would get tired of asking and buy the tickets for both of them herself.", "People like that don\u2019t get angry at you for doing what they can\u2019t though.", "The first thought I had was whether the husband might have ADHD?", "Travel is changing. Almost every fight is full, business travelers are back on most flights too and airlines are eliminating their frequent flyer programs because they don\u2019t need them as much anymore due to the high demand. Waiting to book flights won\u2019t work the way it used to as most fights are overbooked. One way some people are playing it is to book flights, take the offers to get bumped and take in money that way. Some airlines offer $1500 to take a later flight.", "That sounds like she read the exact same article I did.   I\u2019m way to paranoid to utilize that.  Waiting until 6 weeks out to start vacation planning would mean I need another vacation to de stress from planning the first.  Maybe if I didn\u2019t have fixed school vacation schedules to work around.", "As in flying out on a Tuesday or booking a ticket on a Tuesday?", "I also got told this by someone whose job it used to be to price plane tickets.", "Used to be very true 10+years ago, but that 10 years mark is when it stopped working in my experience.", "All of this is now changed because of Covid and fuel prices btw", "It used to be that way. Maybe still is for a few airlines but not the budget airlines in Europe for sure.", "Buying on a Tuesday is not cheaper. Flying on a Tuesday is cheaper.", "We've booked flights way in advance and then they change the plane. The extra legroom that we booked is ignored and they put us in regular seats and then we have to call and demand that we get what we paid for and they are stunned that we want our seats. Then they will often do it again the next month and the next month. They move us and we have to call and put ourselves back to what we purchased.", "What is with airlines doing that? I don't usually get direct flights (hard to from where I live). But for my vacation in january, and now for the one I am planning for december, the airlines (different airlines) cancelled that flight a few months before, meaning we had to add a couple of days fo our vacation. \n\nLuckily we don't have issues with time off or anything. And we make our budget work. But still! It can be annoying, since we make sure to plan our trip around the lightest work days for my husband", "sounds like he wasn't interested in \\*going\\* anywhere, not just New Orleans.  Got time off work for a fun trip but suggest a 'staycation' instead?!  Nah, man.  He didn't want to go anywhere....", "There are also just times of the year where tickets are more expensive to book. Google flights tracks that pretty well", "wtf hi I'm stupid too then. Seriously. eat shit.\n\nGrumpf just because this sounds immature if I don't expand on it... I hate that you're bullying poster above, and you're absolutely wrong to boot. There might be more to this story of course but seems like the basic facts paint the story pretty clearly.", "Is your mother the superweapon general from c&c generals zero:hour?", "Weaponized incompetence with a side of financial manipulation. What a charmer.", "Sure they do. They're hoping you fail with them, otherwise it's \"not fair.\" They sometimes don't even realize they made the bed themselves, and there's really no excuse for it, but that's the way it is for some especially disorganized folks.", "Yeah it heard the same thing so one time I waited until that timeframe just to see if it was true, but l if I bought the tickets way in advance when I wanted to, they would\u2019ve been cheaper. So if you like planning things far in advance too, screw what the \u201cexperts\u201d say because I\u2019ve found it to not always be the case that tickets are cheaper then.\n\nETA: It *does* seem to be true that they are cheaper on Tuesdays, but the 6 weeks in advance part yeah no", "Man, if I had a vacation planned 6 weeks out\n\nThen that would be my most organized vacation EVER.", "I was a travel agent for 6 years until 2017.\n\nIf you're talking international then there's almost no chance in hell the ticket prices will go down as you approach the date of departure.\n\nThe sweet spot is 9-10 months in advance.", "Meanwhile the other day I bought my return airfare while queuing for the outbound plane.", "Booking on a Tuesday. I've read the same thing... not sure how reliable it is, though.\n\nAlso, use private/incognito browsing to search prices, because apparently prices go up if you have cookies showing you've looked before. Allegedly.", "Never buy tickets on a Friday or Monday.  Monday is usually the day businesses book so they try to get those $$.  Friday because it\u2019s the end of the week and people are burnt out and looking to get away and will over look cost.  Two weeks is the closest you should buy ticket it\u2019s a built in discount the rates go up the closer you get.  Now if the need to fill the plane then it\u2019s two days prior that those discounts appear.  The earlier you book, they open up 10 months out, the more expensive the tickets are because they just can.  Since it\u2019s way early, they just released blocks to travel sites with restrictions.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are the best days to book travel. \n\nWhen searching use the normal browser initially so you can get a base price.  Ten use incognito after so you can research those prices will fluctuate.  Then go back to the browser and check you\u2019ll see the price difference.  Save your trip not book it in the incognito window.  Open in the browser and check prices then book your saved travel if the deal is right.  I know is a lot of work but you\u2019ll get the best deal this way.", "Yep 2 potentials for me. He just didn\u2019t want to go anywhere or their finances are shit and he\u2019s not capable of bringing it up. The wife should know if their finances are shit though and I would hope would have mentioned it but sometimes spouses separate those things which is wild", ">*Google flights tracks that pretty well*\n\nYou make an excellent point. \n\nGoogle Flights and other websites allow you to track prices, and also make recommendations about ticket prices.  The sites will point out things like \u201clowest price in 30 days\u201d and such when you\u2019re tracking prices to particular destinations. The OP\u2018s husband could have easily set up an alert on Google Flights letting him know when the lowest price was.  \n\nHe has no excuse.  For whatever reason, he called her bluff and he lost.", "Critical thinking skills really need to be taught in school.\n\nThe internet has people being proud of their stupidity. smh.", "Okay, then that isn\u2019t excusable and would make them an asshole", "or that you'll pic up their slack.", "My wife is a planner and I am not. I generously refer to myself as *spontaneous* or *incubating*, but I try not to let it affect my wife or kids. If I do screw up in a way that affects them, I sure don't blame my wife for it.", "Plus, you have more flexibility in choosing your seat!! (well, if you buy a ticket that allows for that)", "Thanks for the tips!", "Yeah I've read that too about incognito and better prices. And the 6-8 weeks theory. Not sure about Tuesdays specifically but it kinda makes sense to me. I just wonder what Tuesday is best? I'm Australian so is it my Tuesday? Or US Tuesday? Coz with time differences they are two totally different things! \ud83e\udd74", "This doesn't hold true since COVID anymore. Even the Tuesday thing isn't really a thing anymore. Businesses aren't booking travel like before so the Monday thing isn't affecting things either. \n\nI repeatedly get my best price literally the day the ticket goes on sale. As in, a year ahead. Luckily I have one trip I take yearly so I know the dates a year out. For all other tickets, none of the old tricks work anymore. Sometimes waiting is good if the plane isn't full since they will discount to fill. Other times waiting can cost alot more since many times all that is left is the emergency exit row or \"more legroom\" seats (which is a joke) and they hit you with a huge surcharge. \n\nOther than booking the day my flights open up, pricing strategies are a crap shoot now.", "Yes I love flight tracking. This husband has zero excuses.", "nah iits just a not functioning short term memory. if they can't remember they should say so. but they may remember doing the bed a day ago.. but not that it was a day ago. weird timey wimey thing  lets just say.. a lot is NOT intentional."]}
