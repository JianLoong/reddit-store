(It is shitty though that they are unwilling to compromise and seem to always lead you on)", "NTA, my friend! Sounds like you have some good friends in college who you enjoy spending time with, and have grown apart from your old friends. People grow apart, it doesn't make you an asshole. :)", "NTA. It\u2019s a common thing to outgrow certain friends and groups as you go through life. Sounds like you\u2019ve done your best to draw them out to new activities but they just won\u2019t budge. Some people like varied experiences, some people are home bodies.", "NTA People grow, sometimes that strains or ends friendships.  I'd say be polite but honest and firm.  Shouldn't have to be said but, nobody has a right to peer pressure you and that goes for weed, booze, giving up your hobbies, anything.  Maybe in a few years they mature out of this phase and y'all hang out again.  In the mean time start expanding your friend circle to people interested in your likes.", "NTA. As someone who likes to smoke a lot, stoners with nothing going on in their lives who want to live like side characters from Dude Where's My Car are the worst. Check back in on them in a few years and maybe they'll have grown up some.", "You need new friends.", "NAH  \n\n\nsounds like you are just drifting apart from your friends due to differing interests", "NTA. They shouldn't make plans with you and then blow them off, especially not if the reason is that they spent too much money on drugs. \n\nI don't really understand your position, though.\n\nI go hiking with my friends who like hiking. I go see live shows with my friends who share my taste in music. And I smoke pot and play video games with my friends that like to do that. I feel no need to get my gaming friends to come to the bar with me, or my bar-hopping friends to play video games. \n\nYou say you don't want to do the same thing all the time, but even if they are, you wouldn't be. You have other friends who you do other activities with, you only see your old friends on the occasional visit home. I'm not sure why it bothers you so much that they won't branch out for you - unless you just don't enjoy doing the things you used to AT ALL anymore.", "NTA\n\nSometimes you drift apart from old friends.  In this case,  you've matured out of weed/nintendo, and they haven't.  Just move on.  I don't hang out with my HS friends.  I haven't since college.   I hang out with people that share my current interests.  That's how you grow as a person.", "NTA. You're allowed to choose how you want to spend you time, and smoking weed watching TV all day sounds terrible. I myself am a stoner and I would much rather be high in a kayak or an art museum or a picnic listening to and bonding with my friends than vegging out on a sofa. Laaaame.", "NTA\n\nYour \"friends\" sound like the typical stoners I knew in high school. Sounds like they never grew out of that. You need new friends OP. It's pretty obvious these people only care about getting high instead of actually going out and doing something fun. \n\nHell, if someone invited me out to a pub or to go hiking, you bet your ass I'd go. You sound like a fun and adventurous person, OP. Don't let these pothead \"friends\" ruin that by continuing to keep them around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you still like these guys, perhaps you can do a movie, play games and hang.  If you want to do other active things, clearly these are not people that are interested in doing that.  Don't force it.  Go do it on your own or with other people.\n\nI now have several different friend groups as an adult.  I'd down to drink and smoke occasionally, but also like board games, bowling, frisbee golf and some other activities.  I don't think I have a single friend that checks all these boxes.", "NTA.  I've broken up with someone over this.  Could never find the desire or the funds to go out and do stuff with me, but when it came to a new video game/system, gathering with his friends to get drunk, smoke, etc., time and money were never an issue.  If they can't be bothered to make an effort with you and you're the only one putting in the work, then there's really no point in continuing the friendship.", "Nta People change over time. You no longer have the same interests or priorities.", "NTA... i like to stay in and smoke and hang out..but i also have absolutely NO problem going out to eat etc ... your friends suck. But also sometimes just be sure youre not that friend that cant relax and spend quality time as well.... sometimes you dont ALWAYS have to go do something to have fun... you can go out for dinner and drinks and come back and hang out. There can be balance. Im not saying youre wrong what so ever... just stay self aware that youre not the exhausting friend.", "NTA.\n\nOP, it's time to face the fact that you've outgrown these particular friends. And that is totally okay, it happens when you mature from a child to an adult. The things that you all used to bond over aren't the things that move you any longer. \n\nIn the future, if you just want to keep up with them, you can stop by for a short fifteen minute visit and keep it moving after that.", "you don\u2019t have as much in common anymore, it would be normal to drift apart. less normal to lie about doing things you want to do in what looks like an effort to force(?) you to do things they want to do. weird. nta.", "NTA - it's only natural.  You've gone off to college and have seen the world.  They stay at home and see the world on a digital screen through a cloud of smoke.  They aren't doing anything wrong (except for the 2 weeks thing) and nor are you.  You have just outgrown them.  Live your life, OP.  You've earned it.", "Nah\n\nIt sounds like the friendship ran it's course  and you all just grew apart as people. \n\nEverything ends eventually.", "NTA. You  can have your own interest, and it's sad that they don't want to do what you want. They are TA because they lead you on. They seem to have been stuck in high school, and you moved on. Live your life and forget them.", "NTA you have changed and that\u2019s fine. If you want to keep in touch with them you could stop by on the way to doing something else and hang for and hour or two. Or if that still sucks you may need to let the friendships go. This is a normal part of life.", "If you see them every day then that might be a nice activity but if you\u2019re going out of your way to travel to your hometown and have a limited amount of time I get why OP doesn\u2019t want to do that.

They get to see you, you get to do something besides being a couch potato. Win win.", "You went to college, are launching a career, you have had life experience outside your home town. To put it bluntly, you have matured. Your friends, less so. You are NTA, but neither are they. You are just on different trajectories.\n\nContinue to be kind to them, don\u2019t look down on them. As your life improves, and they are still in the same town, doing the same things, a few of them may grow to resent you. That\u2019s going to be jealousy. But you will loosely keep in touch with a fe of them for a while. Eventually they will start families, or get better jobs. You\u2019ll all be too busy to hang. Eventually the relationship will dwindle to clicking the react button to pics of their new kids etc.\n\nThat\u2019s ok. That\u2019s how it goes. Some people are in your life for the long haul, others are there for only a season. Just be kind a respectful to all of them, unless they become toxic of course.", "NTA we outgrow a lot of people in life...why you keep giving them chances is what concerns me.. seems you have issues letting go...", "NTA - You simply outgrew your old social circle, they dont want to change ,and they dont even respect you anymore. I ran into a similar issue where my high school friends never really launched and are just adult aged versions of who they were my Jr/Sr year. I found that Im not really hanging out with these people anymore, just existing in the same space as them while they remember the \"good times\" while being uncomfortable nearly the entire time. It's like bumping into an old acquaintance at the hometown bar who is there every day, same time, and acts like we were best buddies in school growing up. You dont need to be their distraction of how burnt out and boring their lives have become anymore because that's all take and no give.", "NTA\n\nYou're not an ah for growing up and finding different hobbies. But maybe just let these friends go. You can't change them, and you can't demand that they do things differently.", "NTA.  Let go of them as friends because it\u2019s a one-way only relationship.  If you don\u2019t - pick a date, time and location to meet them there.  If they no-show or cancel.  Done.", "NTA - you grew up, sadly your friends haven\u2019t. Only you can decide if you want to continue friendship under the arrested development terms they set"]}
