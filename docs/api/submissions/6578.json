TIL then, thanks!\n\nSo yeah I guess that really would make OP an AH\u2026", "Hold up \n\nIs this whole dog thing a euphemism?!", "By the time she gets back, if she had rabies she would be very ill and not thinking of \"being physical\" with you.", "I suggest you really, really read up on rabies.  I understand you being concerned, but there is no need for you to be concerned.  The dog would be showing symptoms.  The only thing I would be concerned about is bat being found in a sleeping persons bedroom.  You may not be able to catch it and their bites can be tiny.  I do believe Tthis Podcast Will Kill You did an episoide on rabies too.", "There's literally no proof rabies has ever transferred from human to human through touching or kissing \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/rabies/specific_groups/hcp/exposure.html#:~:text=There%20have%20been%20no%20confirmed,attributable%20to%20organ%2Ftissue%20transplantation.&text=Rabies%20virus%20is%20transmitted%20through%20direct%20contact%20with%20infectious%20tissue%20or%20fluids.", "Unless you plan for her to be on a medical examiners table getting an autopsy there is no rabies test. The dog isn't showing any signs or symptoms of rabies and neither is your gf.", "You can\u2019t test for rabies until after death. \n\nThe dog would not be friendly like that if it had rabies. \n\nThe dog having an owner reduces the chances of rabies.\n\nAgain. The dog would not act like that if it had rabies.  \n\nYou are very under informed about the facts of how rabies transmits and presents.  \n\nDo you have problems with anxiety?  Genuine question, not sarcastic.  Because it sounds like you have problems with anxiety.", "When she gets home, if she bites you? *Then* worry about it.  \n\nShe obviously isn\u2019t worried for herself, and there is only so much you can do.  NTA", "Unless the dog in this story is actually another man and you're actually asking about STDs here, then... what?? Do you even know what rabies is?", "It also gives a phobia of light, so if they\u2019re chilling in the day time and not at dawn/dusk or straight up night it\u2019s a good indication it\u2019s fine. Also- a good indicator that something is wrong is a freakish amount of drool (which is because the virus has made the body hydrophobic and it can no longer swallow)", "You can\u2019t really get checked for rabies she would have to get a full round of vaccines", "No, because there really isn't any reason i jumped to that conclusion, other than that the dog is stray. It doesn't have ANY issues or symptoms. So should I let it go?", "This is correct. Post-exposure vaccine usage works on rabies.   \n\n\nI hear it's painful AF, but you'll die without it if you really were exposed.", "Seriously?? Wow, til", "The incubation period for rabies is called is dormant period. There\u2019s been reported incubation periods longer than 6 years.", "Seems like it is", "Not necessarily,  it can take up to 12 weeks to show symptoms in humans", "Specifically health anxiety.  Saying as someone with health anxiety. Rabies is a common fear with it", "Have seen a raccoon with rabies and honestly, it\u2019s not something you forget seeing.", "I mean, they could euthanize her and check her brain tissue, but I don't think OP wants that.", "Yes", "Yes, let it go.", "Yes OP. Let it go. If the dog is relatively clean and exhibits no signs of rabies/aggression, it\u2019s a ridiculous leap to think it has rabies. There are light dangers from touching any animal that goes outdoors (things like ringworm) - but you\u2019d likely see signs of exposure to that and it\u2019s easily treatable.\n\nDon\u2019t ruin a beautiful experience your girlfriend had by bringing her down about this dog.", "I think it would be reasonable to suggest your GF watch for any odd behavior from the dog that could indicate rabies or another disease. But I don't see reason for major concern at the moment.", "Yes.", "The ONLY way to check if an animal is infected with rabies in that way is to kill it and autopsy the brain. If the rabies is too far gone there is nothing else to do.\n\nYour girlfriend is likely fine, but it never hurts to be careful with precautionary treatment if you are really worried. \n\nEdit: I just read that she hasn't even been scratched or bitten. You're overreacting. \n\nSource: me lmao I was bitten by a squirrel a few years back lol", "You should. rabid animals tend to be aggressive. This dog hasn't shown signs of that", "Exactly. Pain but not dead works for me.", "Depends on where they were bitten if I remember", "Further away from brain the longer it takes I believe", "Yep"]}
