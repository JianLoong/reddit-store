It's a good idea to avoid touching wild or feral animals if you haven't been vaccinated against rabies. \n\nThat said, it doesn't sound like the dog your gf has made friends with is showing any signs of being rabid.

Only post-death brain examination can confirm rabies.", "Rabies primarily affects the nervous system \u2014 it travels along peripheral nerves from the inoculation site to the brain, and causes mass damage to the CNS. Because of this, really any behavior change is possible! In vet school we were taught that any abrupt change in an animal\u2019s behavior is worrying, aggressive or not. A fearful dog suddenly becoming friendly, for example. In wild animals, you might see nocturnal animals active during the day (or vice versa), a lack of fear around humans, traveling into urban areas, etc. but definitely not always going to see aggression. The damage to nerves is also thought to be what causes what people perceive to be hydrophobia \u2014 instead of an actual fear of water, they lose the ability to swallow and it presents as drooling, foam at the mouth, etc.", "Per the CDC: \u201cDiagnosis in humans\n\nSeveral tests are necessary to diagnose rabies ante-mortem (before death) in humans; no single test is sufficient. Tests are performed on samples of saliva, serum, spinal fluid, and skin biopsies of hair follicles at the nape of the neck. Saliva can be tested by virus isolation or reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum and spinal fluid are tested for antibodies to rabies virus. Skin biopsy specimens are examined for rabies antigen in the cutaneous nerves at the base of hair follicles.\u201d", "This is the funniest thing I've seen om this post. \"Oh look the dog is running away from the wave.

It does NOT cause hydrophobia in the sense that animals or people are actually scared of water \u2014 it impairs the nerves that allow swallowing, which presents as an inability to swallow and a lot of retained saliva in the mouth, which gives the classic foamy and drooling appearance. I\u2019ve never heard of a fear of light either. Just the classic atypical behavior changes, which may mean aggression and may also mean nocturnal animals suddenly active during the daytime and vice versa. It can also mean a loss of fear towards humans, increased friendliness in a normally fearful animal, etc.", "To add to this ~fun~ fact, rabies travels via peripheral nerves from the inoculation site to the brain. It\u2019s thought that the damage it does to the nervous system leads to the nerves responsible for swallowing being impaired! The mass damage to the nervous system is also why rabies can cause a wide variety of behavior changes, and aggression is not always one of them.", "Not just because of that, there would be other signs, like foaming and being aggressive, also I have already been corrected and admitted I had the wrong interpretation, so, you\u2019re late, bucko.", "Oh gross!

It was a sweet dog, easy to treat, no cause for concern at the time.

While tourists love to help the street dogs abroad, the best thing to do for everyone\u2019s safety is feeding from a distance and donating money/time to spay/neuter/vaccination charities - not cuddling.
