That's a major AH move, in my mind. \n\n\nThat YOU don't like your dad or that he moved on, that's YOUR thing.  Your brother might be more able to forgive, or knows something you don't, or likes the fiancee, or whatever reason it might be. \n\nIt would be understandable if you didn't want your dad at your house, or if you didn't want to go visit him, but dictating who your brother can visit and be happy for shouldn't be something you do.", "YTA- \n\nIt's your money and your free to do what you want with it,.but it's pretty fucked up you'd just throw away his future for going to a wedding.\n\nSo every time he does something you don't like your going to hold financial blackmail over his head?

You're making demands of his life based on your view of events that he may very well just disagree with, could in fact be wrong, or maybe he's not willing to end his relationship with his dad over it. This is between you and your dad. Taking away your brothers college tuition was a power move. Who was it really intended to hurt?\n\nOh right. Your dad. Your brother's a person, dude, not a pawn.

You do not use your money to control other people lives and that is exactly what you are doing and that is not right. Your brother is not doing anything illegal, immoral or wrong. If he wants to attend the wedding then he has every right to do that. I don't know if your dad cheated on your mom and apparently neither do you, not for a fact anyways.

What proof do you have that happened? do you even have circumstantial evidence that this is the case? I know 5 months is quick, but ffs get over yourself unless you can tell us exactly why you think this is the case and it doesn't include \"5 months is too fast\". \n\nCutting off your entire family because you assume people who moved on maybe a little too fast must have been cheating is asinine. \n\nYTA", "YTA-you\u2019re punishing your brother for having his own opinion about the situation. You can\u2019t control him with your money-that\u2019s flat wrong. \n\nAND-it\u2019s been 3 years now. It\u2019s unfortunate that you\u2019re holding on to this grudge still. You\u2019re NTA for that; no one can tell you how to feel, but it seems mean to me after this much time.", "YTA. Some people grieve differently,  some people can't stand to be alone. My step mom stayed with my Dad through the end of his cancer, and rekindled an old relationship a month or two later. I know for a fact there was no contact before his passing. It happens. You can't blackmail people to get them to match your feelings.", "So, your brother lost a parent as a teenager and has one parent, plus you, as a safety net. \n\nIs it possible that your parents had a conversation about him moving on before she passed? Might they have been headed for divorce before she got sick? I only ask this because when my grandma was dying apparently she picked out some women from church that she thought would be great for my grandpa and encouraged him to move on. He told her she was nuts, but he ended up marrying one of them. \n\nWould your mom want your brother to choose between you and your dad? \n\nI think your anger with your dad is valid. But your brother\u2019s acceptance of this might be partly due to not wanting to lose his father, too. Or maybe he has a different understanding of your dad\u2019s relationship.

You presume that your father was cheating when I actually assumed he just fell back into a comfortable old relationship (HIMYM theory- whenever you resume dating someone from your past it isn\u2019t a *new* relationship, merely hitting unpause on previous time). \n\nThis is completely ridiculous to torch your relationships with who you have left just because you need help processing your grief. Please OP, get some grief counseling and save what you have left. It sounds like you had a good relationship prior to this with your brother and that is worth your effort.

You are withholding someone's education because he's not as hateful as you and wants his dad happy. You have no evidence of cheating...Also he already knew her and dated her in HS, so make sense it took less time to fall on love again. Doesn't mean he didn't love your mother or that he cheated.

It's time to find some healing and move on.", "YTA\n\nFirst things first, let me give you my deepest condolences over your mom's passing. \n\nI lost my dad a year ago, and it was the worst time of my life. I can sorta imagine what you're going through.  I know 5 months is a short time to get over someone, but may I ask if your mom was terminally ill? It could be that your dad had been mourning her death for years. I also don't think it's fair that you can't let your dad move on and find love again. I've seen people who lost a loved one, and it completely broke them. \n\nBut I agree with the others. You're being controlling and manipulative over your brother, and it's not fair that you would risk his future and career over the wedding.", "YTA. You agreed to pay for his schooling and now you are being petty and making him choose between your father and you. And do you have proof you dad cheated on your mom? Yeah, it was fast, but\nSome people done like to be alone and it\u2019s not like he married her right away, it\u2019s two years later. Grow up and stop putting your brother in the middle. You\nMaking him choose between his education and your\nFather. Don\u2019t you see how wrong that is?", "NAH because there\u2019s a lot to unpack. Because of the big age difference and because you are housing him and funding him, you probably feel less like a sister and more like his parent (which you aren\u2019t) which makes you feel entitled to control what he does (which you don\u2019t). You can\u2019t hold his college money over his head to make him do whatever you want. On the other hand, he shouldn\u2019t have chosen an expensive university and expected you to pay for it. If he wants to be an adult who make his own life choices and do what he wants, he should probably start taking responsibility for himself, meaning he needs to move out of your house and pay his own tuition.", "YTA.

Cut him some slack sit down and talk to him and explain your feelings towards your dad and his attending the wedding upsets you but that he is well within his rights to attend if he wants.

You listened to a reasonable argument and may change your mind. Nice!", "Him, op is a man", "Why does the brother suck?", "WTF. Stop projecting.", "Corrected. Sorry!", "This.

You're using your financial grip hold over your brother to control his life l and force him to do what you want under the threat of you cutting him off and ruining his future. \n\nDo you want him to never come to you for anything ever again? Cause that's how you do it. And considering his circumstances not coming to you is going to push him closer to your dad and his new wife.", "YTA", "Soft YTA on this one.

Also this relationship did not start with two complete strangers who did not know each other at all and then rushed everything. It started with two people who had dated already likely for years and who already therefore had a significant history to build upon. I\u2019m not saying that they picked up immediately where they left off but they did at least start this relationship with a significant head start that others don\u2019t have. You clearly with all due respect need therapy as you weren\u2019t ready for him to be with anyone after your mother let alone with someone he\u2019d already been with before but from what you wrote there is no indication of any cheating at all. If you have an issue then take it up with your dad but please don\u2019t nuke your own brothers future and your relationship with him just to spite your dad because it won\u2019t.

Good luck fixing this.", "YTA\n\nPunishing your brother because he doesn't agree with you is not something I consider acceptable and it will ruin your relationship with him.

A friend of mine is dealing with it as well. Her mom was sick for a long time and we assume her dad did a lot of his mourning before her mom actually died as everyone knew it was When, not If.

It's a combo of familiar and completely completely separate from life their life with their deceased spouse. I'm not being callous but it's like going back to the last previous save point.     Deceased spouse is PAIN things that remind you of deceased spouse are PAIN.  I've seen one of the happiest married women, a person I use as an example of ideal marriage talk about high school boyfriends for years after her husband of 50 years died ( she couldn't talk to her kids about their dad for a couple years after he died) every happy memory for 50 years was connected to him. \n\nIt's also really common to start dating a friend or relative of deceased spouse more so if they are also widowed.  \n\n\n\"They got too close too fast\" in no way equals they were cheating.

My stepfather has never lived alone and is a man who loves having someone to care for and love. And he didn't want to be in the house where his wife had died. It was really hard but ... I kind of get it. He was only 64 when my mother died, he's got a lot of life ahead of him and he's not the kind of man who can happily live alone.", "NTA, dad can pay", "Why is your brother such a useless leech?", "I have no doubt that something likely was going on before your mother passed as well but you\u2019re using the fact that you pay his tuition against him so he\u2019ll make the decisions you want.

But you might consider that people who have happy marriages (especially men) often move on to a new marriage quickly after the death of a spouse. They love being married, and want to keep that in their lives. Maybe there are other good reasons for your estrangement, but if the speed of his remarriage is the only thing between you, it's worth considering that it might be happening because of how much he loved your mom, rather than how little.", "Yes you are.

What other kinds of control do you want to wield over his life in exchange for that money? \n\nAs for your dad, it really sucks your mom died, especially with you being involved so heavily in her final illness. That\u2019s hard and hard to grieve from. But your dad getting married three years later isn\u2019t disrespectful, it\u2019s not a betrayal of you or your mom. As gently as I can, please let me recommend grief therapy. It\u2019s different than more general therapy, it\u2019s more targeted, and it\u2019s been some of the most helpful therapy I\u2019ve had in my life.", "You shouldn\u2019t control others with money within reason. It\u2019s reasonable that your bro wants to go to his father\u2019s wedding. \n\nYou can have your opinion about the relationship, but you seem to be speculating about it in a poor light.

Sounds to me like your parents had a really wonderful love story and you\u2019re brother is happy for your dad\u2019s newfound happiness after such grief.

That\u2019s major asshole territory. If I were your brother and you followed through with this, that would be an end to our relationship.

It is realistic to have moved on from a relationship within five months without cheating during the relationship.", "YTA\n\nDo not sabotage your little brother's future by financially punishing him for liking different people than you like.

You have basically forced your brother into a no win situation.

Your Brother has the right to support him.", "Question, why where you got mother's main caregiver and not your dad?", "YTA. \n\nYour brother wants a relationship with his father, and using your finances to control him is pretty gross. \n\nLet's say your father did have an affair and was with this woman before your mother passed. Okay, that makes him a shitty dude and if you don't want to be around him, that makes sense. But your brother wants his father in his life, and that is also a perfectly understandable position. People who cheat did a terrible thing, but it doesn't make them fully horrible people that no one should be around. Lots of parents who cheat still go on to be loved and have relationships with your children, and while they may not deserve it, their children do deserve to have good relationships with their parents, if that's what they want. \n\nAnd second, you aren't sure what the timeline was. Your Dad could have had some contact with this woman for years (fine), may have leaned on her emotionally while your mother was sick (also okay) and moved fast because they knew each other. Your mother was sick for awhile, and I can't imagine what that must be like for you, or for your Dad. If your Dad treated your mom kindly, that is what matters. \n\nAnd lets say your Dad wasn't great to your mom, okay well then again I get why you don't want a relationship with him. But your brother gets to make his own choices. Is your anger at your Dad worth losing your brother over? Can you really not appreciate all the reasons your brother, at 19 would want to keep a relationship with his one living parent, despite what he may have done?\n\nYou aren't just \"trying\" to manipulate your brother, you are fully using your financial support to make him feel how you feel and do what you want. You can say you don't want your dad around your home, you can say you won't share space with your Dad, but fully cutting your brother off over this is full AH behavior and you are going to end up with not much family left.", "YTA. You are using money to try to control the relationship between your dad and brother. Going to the wedding isn\u2019t a betrayal but pulling promised financial support is. While your dad moved on quickly, it doesn\u2019t sound like your brother believes he cheated. His relationship with his dad isn\u2019t about you and he can genuinely love and care about both you and your father. Punishing him for that is immensely unfair.", "NTA\n\nYou are right to suspect and is your money.", "YTA, sorry.", "YTA about the college funds but also for holding a grudge against your dad.

Your brother doesn't feel like your father did anything wrong and to be fair it sounds like you don't have any evidence to say that he did beyond your gut feeling - BUT lots of people upon losing a parent feel the next relationship their surviving parent has is a betrayal, even more so when not a huge amount of time has elapsed, so there is a good chance your instincts are being distorted by grief. Your brother does not have to pick sides here, because there are no sides, it's just a family whose members grieve in different ways and at different rates. Holding his entire future over a precipice just because you don't like that your dad is getting remarried and you want your brother to back you up is a bit shitty though. He has lost just as much as you have; should it be a surprise that he doesn't want to lose his other parent over something he doesn't even believe is wrong?", "It\u2019s time to stop babying brother.", "Sending hugs.

That to me is financial abuse you are using against him.\n\nIt is fine that you have a problem with your dad getting married so soon. With that said you do not have the right to dictate to blackmail your brother to not go to your dad's wedding. Just because you think he moved on too fast.\n\nI can see the condition of your continued help be like if he has good grades.

Good for you, OP!", "While it\u2019s good that you see you were being unfair, I hope that you have an honest conversation with yourself about your feelings toward everything. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d be hurt by your father moving on. But when you feel so strongly that you were willing to ruin your brother\u2019s future over a few hours of socializing? That is well beyond \u201cunfair\u201d. It shows that your emotions on the topic are destructive and extremely unhealthy. I *strongly* implore you to seek counseling to work through this.    \n\nI\u2019d also mention some food for thought: when a spouse dies after a long health battle, it is extremely common for children to think that the surviving spouse has moved on too quickly. What they fail to take note of is that for the surviving spouse, they have been preparing for and going through the stages of grief long before the actual death of their husband/wife. So by the time it happens, they are closer to acceptance. They don\u2019t grieve shorter or any less than you; they just started grieving earlier.", "Your dad *MAY* have cheated.  You torpedoed your relationship over a *possibility*?  And are considering ruining your relationship with your brother because he isn't as accusation-happy as you? \n\nThat's....a choice.", "But you don't know that he cheated, and you also probably don't know what kind of understanding they had.\n\nJust for a little perspective, due to me needing a lot of care I moved away from my wife and kids into an assisted living facility. We are still married and love each other, but I also want both my wife and kids to be happy or find happiness, and if that involves my wife looking for comfort elsewhere I'm not gonna stand in her way. So there are situations where both partners are okay with something like this.\n\nAlso, as others have said, maybe it is not up to you to decide how your father processes the grief and how quickly he moves on. I'm sure you want him to be happy, right?", "That's also a good way to get used. Eventually, brother may cave. and go \"Ok\" and then as soon as he's financially secure himself, drop his older brother like a hot potato and you'll never get that relationship back again, because he left it when you started putting those types of restrictions up...", "borther, I hardly know 'er!", "The \"funny\" Part is op isnt even Paying for it completly and the dad Pays a part.", "The definition of \"my house\" also plays a role, imo. If you're a \\*guest\\* in someone's home, they have a lot of leeway in setting rules, because you can choose not to attend. It's definitely not your house.\n\nBut if you're a child or other person who lives in the house but doesn't technically own it... well, there's a difference in what kind of rules are reasonable. There's nowhere else for a kid to go. And it also means the definition of \"my house\" is not based on \"I live here, I contribute to it running smoothly, I am a part of the household\", but based on \"I make the money\"; the latter is a lot more easily twisted into something abusive."]}
