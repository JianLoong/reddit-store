That's a major AH move, in my mind. \n\n\nThat YOU don't like your dad or that he moved on, that's YOUR thing.  Your brother might be more able to forgive, or knows something you don't, or likes the fiancee, or whatever reason it might be. \n\nIt would be understandable if you didn't want your dad at your house, or if you didn't want to go visit him, but dictating who your brother can visit and be happy for shouldn't be something you do.", "YTA- \n\nIt's your money and your free to do what you want with it,.but it's pretty fucked up you'd just throw away his future for going to a wedding.\n\nSo every time he does something you don't like your going to hold financial blackmail over his head? That's pretty shitty", "YTA. Sure, you\u2019re upset that your father moved on quickly and you have the right to feel that way. But imagine how your brother feels having lost his mom and now having to choose between being happy for his father and financial security.", "Giving your brother money does not give you the right to dictate his relationship with his father. \n\n \n\n>I\u00b4m convinced something happened between them prior to my mom\u00b4s passing.\n\nThat may be enough for you, but it's not reasonable to *demand* that be enough for him. You're making demands of his life based on your view of events that he may very well just disagree with, could in fact be wrong, or maybe he's not willing to end his relationship with his dad over it. This is between you and your dad. Taking away your brothers college tuition was a power move. Who was it really intended to hurt?\n\nOh right. Your dad. Your brother's a person, dude, not a pawn. YTA", "YTA. You're controlling what your brother does by withholding money for his education. You don't have to support your dad's relationship, but you can't tell your brother he has to agree with you or else", "If you want to completely destroy your relationship with your brother, I guess you're free to do so.", "I feel YTA. Your feelings are your feelings. Just as your brother's are his.\n\nYou don't get to dictate, nor punish him when his feelings don't align with yours.", "YTA. You\u2019re using tuition, education and his future career as some sort of power move to get him to do what you want.", "YTA\n\nWhat is the goal of punishing your brother for your father\u2019s behavior?", "YTA for trying to control and manipulate your brother with money.", "Not only are you unfairly judging your father for a relationship he entered after your mother was dead? You're also holding your sibling hostage. This is so unfair. You don't know what it's like to be older and lose a spouse. You don't. Have some generosity. Have some perspective. And keep your commitment to your sibling to pay their tuition. Or don't. And lose them too. YTA", "YTA. Just because you feel one way doesn\u2019t mean he has to feel the same. And this is his EDUCATION. His FUTURE. It is extremely generous of you to be paying for it in the first place, but also extremely unfair to hold it against him and put him in the middle.", "YTA for one HUGE reason. You do not use your money to control other people lives and that is exactly what you are doing and that is not right. Your brother is not doing anything illegal, immoral or wrong. If he wants to attend the wedding then he has every right to do that. I don't know if your dad cheated on your mom and apparently neither do you, not for a fact anyways. Even if he did that is your Father's short coming, not your brother's. If you are mad at your father then you take it out on him, not the rest of your family.", "YTA.", "YTA, you have no proof of an affair even though the timeline is suspect.", "YTA.\n\nYou have your feelings about the situation and he has his. Both are perfectly valid. However, you using your financial position over your brother to get him to not attend the wedding is extremely shitty and controlling behavior. Don't be surprised if he goes no contact with you should you go through with this.", ">They aparently rekindled contact after my mother passed and everything went fast after that, but I\u00b4m convinced something happened between them prior to my mom\u00b4s passing.\n\nGod, you're presumptuous. What proof do you have that happened? do you even have circumstantial evidence that this is the case? I know 5 months is quick, but ffs get over yourself unless you can tell us exactly why you think this is the case and it doesn't include \"5 months is too fast\". \n\nCutting off your entire family because you assume people who moved on maybe a little too fast must have been cheating is asinine. \n\nYTA", "YTA-you\u2019re punishing your brother for having his own opinion about the situation. You can\u2019t control him with your money-that\u2019s flat wrong. \n\nAND-it\u2019s been 3 years now. It\u2019s unfortunate that you\u2019re holding on to this grudge still. You\u2019re NTA for that; no one can tell you how to feel, but it seems mean to me after this much time.", "YTA. Some people grieve differently,  some people can't stand to be alone. My step mom stayed with my Dad through the end of his cancer, and rekindled an old relationship a month or two later. I know for a fact there was no contact before his passing. It happens. You can't blackmail people to get them to match your feelings.", "So, your brother lost a parent as a teenager and has one parent, plus you, as a safety net. \n\nIs it possible that your parents had a conversation about him moving on before she passed? Might they have been headed for divorce before she got sick? I only ask this because when my grandma was dying apparently she picked out some women from church that she thought would be great for my grandpa and encouraged him to move on. He told her she was nuts, but he ended up marrying one of them. \n\nWould your mom want your brother to choose between you and your dad? \n\nI think your anger with your dad is valid. But your brother\u2019s acceptance of this might be partly due to not wanting to lose his father, too. Or maybe he has a different understanding of your dad\u2019s relationship. And it would be heartbreaking to ruin his future because of it. \n\nVery gentle YTA.", "YTA\n\nFinancial abuse much? Look, grief is ugly. But you are literally allowing your grief to destroy your relationships with the rest of your family. You presume that your father was cheating when I actually assumed he just fell back into a comfortable old relationship (HIMYM theory- whenever you resume dating someone from your past it isn\u2019t a *new* relationship, merely hitting unpause on previous time). \n\nThis is completely ridiculous to torch your relationships with who you have left just because you need help processing your grief. Please OP, get some grief counseling and save what you have left. It sounds like you had a good relationship prior to this with your brother and that is worth your effort. Trust me, I miss my brother. I have not spoken with him in years. Do not be me.", "YTA. All you\u2019re doing is causing more pain for everyone (yourself included). \n\nNote: I\u2019m sorry about your mom. That must have been agonizing.", "You\u2019re a HUGE AH. Your poor brother. So what if he wants to attend his own dads wedding? You\u2019re just manipulating and being abusive. You don\u2019t even have proof your dad cheated on your mum.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re abusive. Holding finances over his head to bend him to your will? You\u2019re a TERRIBLE sibling.", "Yep, YTA. You are withholding someone's education because he's not as hateful as you and wants his dad happy. You have no evidence of cheating...Also he already knew her and dated her in HS, so make sense it took less time to fall on love again. Doesn't mean he didn't love your mother or that he cheated. Even if he would stop paying for school for thisis still shitty thing to do.", "YTA.\n\nYou are being petty, manipulative,  and cruel.   It's time to find some healing and move on.", "YTA\n\nFirst things first, let me give you my deepest condolences over your mom's passing. \n\nI lost my dad a year ago, and it was the worst time of my life. I can sorta imagine what you're going through.  I know 5 months is a short time to get over someone, but may I ask if your mom was terminally ill? It could be that your dad had been mourning her death for years. I also don't think it's fair that you can't let your dad move on and find love again. I've seen people who lost a loved one, and it completely broke them. \n\nBut I agree with the others. You're being controlling and manipulative over your brother, and it's not fair that you would risk his future and career over the wedding.", "YTA. You agreed to pay for his schooling and now you are being petty and making him choose between your father and you. And do you have proof you dad cheated on your mom? Yeah, it was fast, but\nSome people done like to be alone and it\u2019s not like he married her right away, it\u2019s two years later. Grow up and stop putting your brother in the middle. You\nMaking him choose between his education and your\nFather. Don\u2019t you see how wrong that is?", "NAH because there\u2019s a lot to unpack. Because of the big age difference and because you are housing him and funding him, you probably feel less like a sister and more like his parent (which you aren\u2019t) which makes you feel entitled to control what he does (which you don\u2019t). You can\u2019t hold his college money over his head to make him do whatever you want. On the other hand, he shouldn\u2019t have chosen an expensive university and expected you to pay for it. If he wants to be an adult who make his own life choices and do what he wants, he should probably start taking responsibility for himself, meaning he needs to move out of your house and pay his own tuition.", "YTA. You\u2019re punishing your brother for something your father may or may not have done years ago, after losing his wife. Men often find a new partner soon after losing one, and although you are still grieving, your mother would want your father to go on with life and be happy.", "YTA.  You are using money to manipulate your brother into doing what you want because you have not properly dealt with your emotions.", "You're looking for strangers on the internet to validate that your dad was cheating on your dying mother. That's what this is really about. YTA.", "So I just have this 2c \n\nMy dad never ever cheated on my step mom, he was there every day till the end. \n\nEvery single high school ex girlfriend who was still in town called him that summer (she passed in spring). \n\nI\u2019m not saying he should be married or forgiven or anything but he also was probably prey.", "YTA - You are definitely a controlling AH. Feel whatever way you want about your dad and his future wife, but who do you think you are to blackmail your brother into agreement?", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s your money, and if he wants to go to his father wedding then ask him to pay his college", "NTA. You're his brother, not his dad you have no obligation to pay for his college.", "YTA if you stop paying for this reason. If you're gonna cut off your brother you better have a much better reason than \"I suspect my dad cheated but have not actual proof.\" Your issues with your father and his wife should not affect your relationship with your brother, it's not fair to him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My interpretation would be that he is happy to see your dad happy again, while you think he is moving to fast (for you). Both views are ok, its how you handle them that counts. You are forcing your brother to take your stand and punish him for having a different viewpoint. You know thats not fair. And its harsh to punish him with his education. Don\u2019t ruin your relationship with your brother over this. \nYou lost your mom, you cut contact with your father because of his new relationship and now your brother. Please dont lose them all.

I can understand your disappointment in your brother attending the wedding but it\u2019s not really a just reason for cutting him off. Had he brought your dad to your home or tried to force something between you and your dad maybe. Like you, your brother lost one parent and he is probably afraid of losing another. Cut him some slack sit down and talk to him and explain your feelings towards your dad and his attending the wedding upsets you but that he is well within his rights to attend if he wants. Grief can make people do things differently than they normally would.  You\u2019re choosing one reaction and your brother another. Neither one of you are wrong.", "Nta.
