That's a major AH move, in my mind. \n\n\nThat YOU don't like your dad or that he moved on, that's YOUR thing.  Your brother might be more able to forgive, or knows something you don't, or likes the fiancee, or whatever reason it might be. \n\nIt would be understandable if you didn't want your dad at your house, or if you didn't want to go visit him, but dictating who your brother can visit and be happy for shouldn't be something you do.", "YTA- \n\nIt's your money and your free to do what you want with it,.but it's pretty fucked up you'd just throw away his future for going to a wedding.\n\nSo every time he does something you don't like your going to hold financial blackmail over his head?

You're making demands of his life based on your view of events that he may very well just disagree with, could in fact be wrong, or maybe he's not willing to end his relationship with his dad over it. This is between you and your dad. Taking away your brothers college tuition was a power move. Who was it really intended to hurt?\n\nOh right. Your dad. Your brother's a person, dude, not a pawn.

And keep your commitment to your sibling to pay their tuition. Or don't. And lose them too. YTA", "YTA. Just because you feel one way doesn\u2019t mean he has to feel the same.

You do not use your money to control other people lives and that is exactly what you are doing and that is not right. Your brother is not doing anything illegal, immoral or wrong. If he wants to attend the wedding then he has every right to do that. I don't know if your dad cheated on your mom and apparently neither do you, not for a fact anyways.

What proof do you have that happened? do you even have circumstantial evidence that this is the case? I know 5 months is quick, but ffs get over yourself unless you can tell us exactly why you think this is the case and it doesn't include \"5 months is too fast\". \n\nCutting off your entire family because you assume people who moved on maybe a little too fast must have been cheating is asinine. \n\nYTA", "YTA-you\u2019re punishing your brother for having his own opinion about the situation. You can\u2019t control him with your money-that\u2019s flat wrong. \n\nAND-it\u2019s been 3 years now. It\u2019s unfortunate that you\u2019re holding on to this grudge still. You\u2019re NTA for that; no one can tell you how to feel, but it seems mean to me after this much time.", "YTA. Some people grieve differently,  some people can't stand to be alone. My step mom stayed with my Dad through the end of his cancer, and rekindled an old relationship a month or two later. I know for a fact there was no contact before his passing. It happens. You can't blackmail people to get them to match your feelings.", "So, your brother lost a parent as a teenager and has one parent, plus you, as a safety net. \n\nIs it possible that your parents had a conversation about him moving on before she passed? Might they have been headed for divorce before she got sick? I only ask this because when my grandma was dying apparently she picked out some women from church that she thought would be great for my grandpa and encouraged him to move on. He told her she was nuts, but he ended up marrying one of them. \n\nWould your mom want your brother to choose between you and your dad? \n\nI think your anger with your dad is valid. But your brother\u2019s acceptance of this might be partly due to not wanting to lose his father, too. Or maybe he has a different understanding of your dad\u2019s relationship.

You presume that your father was cheating when I actually assumed he just fell back into a comfortable old relationship (HIMYM theory- whenever you resume dating someone from your past it isn\u2019t a *new* relationship, merely hitting unpause on previous time). \n\nThis is completely ridiculous to torch your relationships with who you have left just because you need help processing your grief. Please OP, get some grief counseling and save what you have left. It sounds like you had a good relationship prior to this with your brother and that is worth your effort. Trust me, I miss my brother. I have not spoken with him in years. Do not be me.", "YTA.

Holding finances over his head to bend him to your will? You\u2019re a TERRIBLE sibling.", "Yep, YTA. You are withholding someone's education because he's not as hateful as you and wants his dad happy. You have no evidence of cheating...Also he already knew her and dated her in HS, so make sense it took less time to fall on love again. Doesn't mean he didn't love your mother or that he cheated. Even if he would stop paying for school for thisis still shitty thing to do.", "YTA.\n\nYou are being petty, manipulative,  and cruel.   It's time to find some healing and move on.", "YTA\n\nFirst things first, let me give you my deepest condolences over your mom's passing. \n\nI lost my dad a year ago, and it was the worst time of my life. I can sorta imagine what you're going through.  I know 5 months is a short time to get over someone, but may I ask if your mom was terminally ill? It could be that your dad had been mourning her death for years. I also don't think it's fair that you can't let your dad move on and find love again. I've seen people who lost a loved one, and it completely broke them. \n\nBut I agree with the others. You're being controlling and manipulative over your brother, and it's not fair that you would risk his future and career over the wedding.", "YTA. You agreed to pay for his schooling and now you are being petty and making him choose between your father and you. And do you have proof you dad cheated on your mom? Yeah, it was fast, but\nSome people done like to be alone and it\u2019s not like he married her right away, it\u2019s two years later. Grow up and stop putting your brother in the middle. You\nMaking him choose between his education and your\nFather. Don\u2019t you see how wrong that is?", "NAH because there\u2019s a lot to unpack. Because of the big age difference and because you are housing him and funding him, you probably feel less like a sister and more like his parent (which you aren\u2019t) which makes you feel entitled to control what he does (which you don\u2019t). You can\u2019t hold his college money over his head to make him do whatever you want. On the other hand, he shouldn\u2019t have chosen an expensive university and expected you to pay for it. If he wants to be an adult who make his own life choices and do what he wants, he should probably start taking responsibility for himself, meaning he needs to move out of your house and pay his own tuition.", "YTA.

Cut him some slack sit down and talk to him and explain your feelings towards your dad and his attending the wedding upsets you but that he is well within his rights to attend if he wants.

It's a confusing time for anyone and especially for people with complicated family dynamics. You've taken on a parental role with him so it's normal for him to have moments of rebellion. Approaching it with kindness and support (without hiding your opinion of your dad) is more likely to lead to him seeing the problems with your dad (assuming he really is a shitty person). \n\nThat being said, losing a spouse is horrific and men are known to cope by immediately finding a new partner. Since they knew each other in high school, it can make it easier to move quickly. You might not approve but you can't really judge how he grieves.

I guess my point is: was he a shitty person before and the OP kind of is like \u201cthis is the final straw\u201d or is OP being sorta unreasonable in judging how his dad dealt with his spouse\u2019s dying.
