I understand her being upset, but she does not know how to communicate with others. She said I wasn\u2019t a real friend because i was dropping out & that i was selfish. That my input was useless anyways. So i told her that she should stop using her bridesmaids in place of the wedding planner she clearly can\u2019t afford and that she had unrealistic expectations that she couldn\u2019t even uphold herself. Maybe it was an asshole thing to say but at the time, it felt right!\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if the others follow suit and her wedding party ends up being comprised of the one friend who is clearly stupid enough to put up with her shit.", "She started planning the wedding 2 months before the day. WTF. She should have started that way before then. And kept bridesmaids informed the entire time not drop things on them last minute.

Neither is she. You really don\u2019t know each other if you\u2019ve only met for a few playdates in the span of over 4 years. It\u2019s super bizarre that she asked you to be her bridesmaid when you\u2019re not close at all. But it\u2019s also pretty telling that she didn\u2019t have an actual close friend to ask instead of you. It sounds like she\u2019s burned some people before. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason for you to feel bad about bowing out. Even the 4 year gap between accepting the role and the wedding date is reason enough to bow out, because your life now might not have room for the commitment even if you truly WANTED to be in the wedding. Her bridezillaness makes it totally impossible for a SAHM of 3 to accommodate her needs. You really can\u2019t deliver the service she requires. I don\u2019t see how you have any choice but to withdraw if you can\u2019t do the job.", "NTA she sounds like a lot, and why leave it 2 months before to plan that sounds so stressful", "Are you really wondering if you\u2019re the AH?\nThe bride is being inconsiderate and unreasonable.\n\nNTA, obviously. If anyone thinks otherwise, probably should seek help.", "I can't get over the fact that OP was asked to be a bridesmaid 4 years ago.... THEN the bride starts planning 2 months out!", "NTA. \n\nFirst, bridesmaids may offer to host a bridal shower and you didn't. You're not responsible for it and it shouldn't take all day.\n\nSecond, two Bachelorettes? She's extra but nobody's required to give her a gift of paying the Airbnb when not attending. Furthermore, costs should be collaborative as in ask people their budget and plan accordingly \n\nThird, she's supposed to buy the robes if she wants people to wear them.\n\nFourth, you can't expect to keep hitting people with last minute expenses and changing your mind.\n\nYou were right to bow out. I'm betting you were asked because she needed more people to help finance.", "NTA- You will spend a fortune before she makes up her mind.\nStep out. Use kids as an excuse.  You can't afford it to be the bridesmaid that she deserves to support her.\n\nMake it about her.  Tell her she needs people around her that can devote their time to making her day a special as possible and you just do not have the resources to be able to do that.", "I applaud you for hanging in there, putting up with that. NTA", "NTA,  you lasted longer than I would have done.", "NTA. Thank goodness you had the courage to get out. Should have done it in the group chat so others would have the courage to leave too.", "NTA. She\u2019s bei  by ridiculous. She thinks she\u2019s living in a lifetime movie where she can be a klutzy, emotional mess and friends and family (and almost random strangers) will band together to make her dreams come true because the world is a magical place and she\u2019s the center of it. She needs a full on reality check. Maybe a disaster of a wedding will provide that for her.", "Either they were saving money for a wedding they couldn't afford or that little pandemic got in the way", "I\u2019m guessing Covid had an impact on their plans. If they got engaged in 2019 they could have planned to save for a year\u2026but even allowing for that waiting until 2 months before the wedding day is insane. Even if they couldn\u2019t secure a venue they could have been prepping everything else if they had a specific month/season in mind", "To be fair, 4 years ago is pre-covid; a lot of plans got kyboshed in that period, and the bride could\u2019ve been out of pocket on some of those, leading to a longer delay in getting back up and running.\n\nNone of which is to excuse the complete lack of communication up to 2 months ago, and since then communication overload but without sufficient notice for anything. OP is NTA, bride is a nightmare."]}
