However, my daughter stayed home sick from school today. My wife called out from work to stay with her, since I was already at work.

So, I cancelled my plans.\n\nMy friends are upset, because we have had these plans for a while. I explained my reasoning, but they think it is flawed. Our plans are at six, and I get home at three, so that would give my wife three hours to rest and recharge. While I understand his theory, I think the reality would be different. By the time I shower and everything, it will be more like three thirty, and I would have to start getting ready at five to leave at five thirty. So really that's only an hour and a half for her.\n\nMy friends say I am flaking on them, but if I took care of our daughter when she was sick all day and then my wife came home, spelled me for an hour and then bounced, I would feel hurt.

There are 2 parents.  Both of you don't need to take care of a sick kid. \n\nThat said, I get your side as well.  \n\nHere is my guess, based on how most of my friends with kids are.  You never initiate plans with your friends, and when they include you, you either decline or bail last minute.  I'd wager this isn't your first time.  As someone in the friends situation, let me say how annoying that gets.  \n\nMy suggestion would be to be very apologetic about cancelling, then YOU initiate plans for a make up time to hang with your buddies.  And be sure to keep that plan.", "NTA these are horrible friends. If I had plans with a friend who had a sick child, and they *showed up anyway,* I\u2019d be upset.
