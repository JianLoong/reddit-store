There is a massive, conspicuous contrast between expensive electronics and a few nail polishes. How do you think it made her feel opening a much smaller token gift while they got big ones? Her father\u2019s circumstances don\u2019t mean that you should leave her out when she is with you, no one is expecting you to match his spending but within your own budget you should allocate equal portions to each of your children, not blow the whole budget on two and then realise you can only afford to get a small gift for the third.

Then, you basically got the other kids something that so clearly shows favoritism. \n\nWhen you stated you got one of your children a cheaper gift, I assumed that mean you got them something that was half the price of the other things, because they were given a fair amount of money for some other thing they wanted to do recently, and wanted to keep things semi-even. But no. Instead Mara opened up her drug store present, while the other kids got a fancy laptop and fancy phone. You didn\u2019t have to go ahead with the purchases when you saw the price tags.

Normally I would say that Needs are more important than Wants, and while your other children needed these things, the WAY you presented them as 'gifts' altogether was extremely HARMFUL to your relationship with your daughter and to her self esteem.

You are taking it out on her because she has a better life then your other two kids. Your suppose to be the parent.\n\nYou just showed your daughter exactly how you feel about her.

Punishing your older daughter for having a wealthy parent is disgusting and it is punishing, because you had no problem spending money for your stepson and younger daughter.

Of course YTA, liars as well.

But when the difference is that vast, and the kid is going to notice, it's gotta be something she's in on and understands or else she'll obviously feel like you don't care about her.\n\nWhen I was a kid, there were a number of times where the fair thing to do would be to give me the same as my siblings or cousins, but the kind thing to do was to give the thing to the person who needed it most.  So my mom came to me, explained the situation, and asked if I was ok with, for example, having less expensive Christmas gifts this year so we could help a cousin who just lost his mom go on a vacation with his dad.  Then, I went into Christmas expecting that my gifts would be smaller so I wasn't getting that big disappointment in the moment.

You could have sat her down and explained to her why her siblings needed the electronics. Or maybe you should have got them the electronics not as gifts but as regular school supplies. I don\u2019t agree depriving the 9 and 17 year olds to pacify Mara. Is it fair that one sibling uses her personal high end electronics while the others make do with rented stuff? The gifts could have been equal value budget stuff and the electronics could have been as I mentioned before, a separate purchase. For those saying a 9 year old doesn\u2019t need a laptop. Yes it\u2019s true. If it\u2019s a choice between buying food for the family and the laptop, she doesn\u2019t need it.

But the right way would have been to sit mara down BEFORE you buy the gifts and explain to her why she has a lot more ressources than her siblings and if she would be fine having only a very small gift so her siblings can have the bigger ones. Kids (at least the good ones, not the spoiled brats) usually have a lot of empathy and are generous, there would have been a big chance she would have agreed. But you went about it in the worst way possible. \n\nMara sucks too. She is 14 and therefor knows about the difference in her ressources compared to her siblings.
