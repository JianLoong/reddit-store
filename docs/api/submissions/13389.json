There is a massive, conspicuous contrast between expensive electronics and a few nail polishes. How do you think it made her feel opening a much smaller token gift while they got big ones? Her father\u2019s circumstances don\u2019t mean that you should leave her out when she is with you, no one is expecting you to match his spending but within your own budget you should allocate equal portions to each of your children, not blow the whole budget on two and then realise you can only afford to get a small gift for the third.

Then, you basically got the other kids something that so clearly shows favoritism. \n\nWhen you stated you got one of your children a cheaper gift, I assumed that mean you got them something that was half the price of the other things, because they were given a fair amount of money for some other thing they wanted to do recently, and wanted to keep things semi-even. But no. Instead Mara opened up her drug store present, while the other kids got a fancy laptop and fancy phone. You didn\u2019t have to go ahead with the purchases when you saw the price tags.

Normally I would say that Needs are more important than Wants, and while your other children needed these things, the WAY you presented them as 'gifts' altogether was extremely HARMFUL to your relationship with your daughter and to her self esteem.

You are taking it out on her because she has a better life then your other two kids. Your suppose to be the parent.\n\nYou just showed your daughter exactly how you feel about her.

Punishing your older daughter for having a wealthy parent is disgusting and it is punishing, because you had no problem spending money for your stepson and younger daughter.

Of course YTA, liars as well.

But when the difference is that vast, and the kid is going to notice, it's gotta be something she's in on and understands or else she'll obviously feel like you don't care about her.\n\nWhen I was a kid, there were a number of times where the fair thing to do would be to give me the same as my siblings or cousins, but the kind thing to do was to give the thing to the person who needed it most.  So my mom came to me, explained the situation, and asked if I was ok with, for example, having less expensive Christmas gifts this year so we could help a cousin who just lost his mom go on a vacation with his dad.  Then, I went into Christmas expecting that my gifts would be smaller so I wasn't getting that big disappointment in the moment.

You could have sat her down and explained to her why her siblings needed the electronics. Or maybe you should have got them the electronics not as gifts but as regular school supplies. I don\u2019t agree depriving the 9 and 17 year olds to pacify Mara. Is it fair that one sibling uses her personal high end electronics while the others make do with rented stuff? The gifts could have been equal value budget stuff and the electronics could have been as I mentioned before, a separate purchase. For those saying a 9 year old doesn\u2019t need a laptop. Yes it\u2019s true. If it\u2019s a choice between buying food for the family and the laptop, she doesn\u2019t need it.

But the right way would have been to sit mara down BEFORE you buy the gifts and explain to her why she has a lot more ressources than her siblings and if she would be fine having only a very small gift so her siblings can have the bigger ones. Kids (at least the good ones, not the spoiled brats) usually have a lot of empathy and are generous, there would have been a big chance she would have agreed. But you went about it in the worst way possible. \n\nMara sucks too. She is 14 and therefor knows about the difference in her ressources compared to her siblings.

You chose to ignore the fact that you had three children to give gifts to and got one of them a lousy gift.

They are equals", "You can literally buy the latest models second hand or refurbished cheaper. New or used can last the same amount of time depending on how they're cared for.

I only upgrade my phone every eight years, and I generally purchase them as refurbished rather than new out of the box. \n\nWhat Mara has was given to her by her father Based on his income. By YOU not treating her the same as the other children, you are telling her that how she is treated by YOU is less important than how your other children are treated by you. \n\nAny material possessions Mara receives outside of your home shouldn\u2019t be used on the scale in your home. \n\nImagine the step-son gets a job, and buys himself the latest iPhone phone after he asked you for a cell phone on his birthday, and didn\u2019t get one.

I mean, he has the funds coming in elsewhere to take care of himself, so what\u2019s the point in getting him anything nice? He can take care of it, just like your ex can take care of all the presents for your daughter. No point in treating her as an equal in your house, since the other two don\u2019t have a wealthy fallback. Better to keep her in her place, I guess. That way you won\u2019t have to buy her anything, because you\u2019ll never really see her after she decided to put her self-worth above your callousness, and decided to cut you out of her life. \n\nNow do us all a favor, and don\u2019t come to this subreddit asking for the truth if you aren\u2019t ready to hear it.", "Don\u2019t know this situation - but a young student in online school might actually need a laptop.", "ok but that is such a good idea!!!
