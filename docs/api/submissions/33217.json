It's terrible. My ex left me for another woman. She had a son just older than ours.

She would give him her kids hand-me-downs and when he came home in them I waited until my son changed and threw them all in the trash when my son wasn't looking. And who gives kids hand-me-down underwear? How freaking trashy. They went to church together while he and I were still married which I thought was hilarious and disgusting. They finally broke up and he started dating someone else, who he eventually married. I had no bad feelings towards her bc she had nothing to do with our break-up. I was just so happy he didn't end up with the AP.\n\nSo I hear you and I understand how you feel. However, like others said, legally you can't keep the kids from seeing her. It sounds like he's not super interested in seeing the kids and just using you as an excuse to keep the drama going. Don't let him. Get a lawyer, get a parenting plan. This protects you and the kids. You can put in the part about \"no visitors can stay overnight unless married,\" but I personally wouldn't bc that might push them to get married. Best case scenario,  when AP doesn't have this drama to feed off of, she'll just leave. Maybe not, you may be stuck with her. Start living your own life. Get therapy, get meds if they might help, and take control of your own life. Put them in the rear view mirror and after awhile, you'll only think about them when you have to. Best of luck.

Unless he's abusive, the best thing for them is to have a relationship with their father. When they are adults they can cut him off if they want, but right now if you encourage that you're doing them a disservice. They may regret this. And your daughter may feel she has to be loyal to you given how bitter and hateful towards the other women you seem to be. Do you think your kids would honestly feel that you'd be happy if they liked the other women? They don't want to hurt their mom.

That if their relationship with dad dosen't work out that's okay, but you want them to give it a try and know you'll be happy if it does. Say that Dad's girlfriend has been with him a long time, so she seems like a likely long term partner to Dad, so avoiding her is not going to work. You know they saw how hurt you were (maybe just say this part to daughter, if she's the only one who caught on) but you promise you've worked on yourself and your feelings and you're okay with them knowing her now. You're okay with them liking her, if they like her. They don't have to like her, but if Dad wants them to be around her than as their Dad that's something they can choose.

Second, having no child support agreement, court mandated or third party mediated, means that he doesn\u2019t feel obliged to see the kids. I can almost guarantee that if you file for child support the first thing he will claim is parental alienation, and ask for 50/50 custody so that he doesn\u2019t have to pay a thing.

If the parents don't submit a plan, the court will enter a default order, or a temporary order, or something, but the law won't just say 'yeah you don't have to deal with the kids at all until one parent has a problem with it.'", "Also, if they got divorced, the judge would automatically make a custody order as part of their divorce judgement.

He was her husband of 10 years. \n\nAnd I agree the kids should come first so, if dad really feels this is stopping him from having a relationship with his kids, maybe he should go to court, push back on that, and reach an agreement with her on custody.

That's never mentioned by me at all.\nI never spoke about the dad in that way at all.\n\nIf we are talking about the op she's got it in her bag.

There is no such thing as parental alienation against stepparents or girlfriends.\n\n>\"you can only see the kids if she's not there\"\n\nThe courts will have a greater problem with him refusing to see the kids than they will with her requiring the mistress not be there.

The default might be joint legal custody, and in some cases there may only be a temporary physical custody order, but there will be *some* law at play here about the rights of the parents and the children. My point is that the law does not leave child custody in legal limbo indefinitely until one of the parents decides to file for something.", "INAL, but in the US its generally impossible to get divorced without a custody agreement if there are children from the marriage.

I remember attending a professional training and the trainer said the worst position to be in is the mother of an abused child.

As a result, she no longer wants to see her father and both parents should respect that, to an extent. Sounds like she still sees her father once a month, without the mistress. That's reasonable.

The judge is who \"decides,\" but they take into account the agreement between the parents, the child's wishes, and (if applicable) the child advocate or guardian ad litem's recommendation. An 11yo saying they don't want to see their dad due to being asked to lie about his mistress *will* carry weight with the court.\n\nThe 11yo will likely be forced to have visitation with her father, at least until she's a teenager, but they won't force her to see the mistress and it's unlikely they'll force her to be in her father's physical custody (although likely he'll still retain 50% legal custody over her education and medical decisions if he wants it).", "I guess the closest thing to a custody agreement we had was us agreeing to handle it ourselves", "lol, Never become a lawyer, and if you ever end up in family court, keep your mouth shut cause you\u2019d lose the case so fcking quickly \ud83d\udc80", "I guess so!

Sometimes they consider the opinion of older children closer to legal age, but ultimately, the court is going to do what is best for the child and research has proven time and time again that relationships with both parents almost always correlates with positive outcomes for the child. Sorry that wasn\u2019t the case for you. If this guy isn\u2019t a bad dad, his relationship with his daughter has the ability to repair through quality time spent together (mandated by the court) and then when the child is an adult, she can decide for herself if she wants to continue a relationship with her father. But she doesn\u2019t get to decide that at 11. And dad shouldn\u2019t have to tell his partner of 3 years to go home when his kids are around for no logical reason.

I believe forcing her for 5 years to be around her father via courts (after voicing this to the court), and his first mistress now partner until she is old enough to be asked again to be counter productive.  \n\nWhy not, believe her now, and figure out a balance NOW that works for her, and when she is an adult, she can decide for herself if she wants to continue the relationship, grow it, whatever she wishes. \n\nIf you forced me, as an 11 year old, to be around my father, via the courts against my will, whatever you think would be healthy for me, or better to force it, would not be. However, if you listened to me, backed off, and again, let me decide how I felt to opening the door to a relationship with my father in time, the chances of me being receptive to it are much greater. \n\nThe only question I truly have about all of this. Is if you asked the kids what they wanted, without either parent there, what would they say?"]}
