You are going to have to help your kids through this transition, like it or not, and in my experience people like your husband and that woman who destroyed your family care nothing about anyone but themselves and certainly not the children\u2019s best interests.

It's terrible. My ex left me for another woman. She had a son just older than ours. I never fought to keep my son away from her bc I didn't think there was any danger, even though the whole thing put in a very bad place, mental health-wise. She would give him her kids hand-me-downs and when he came home in them I waited until my son changed and threw them all in the trash when my son wasn't looking. And who gives kids hand-me-down underwear? How freaking trashy. They went to church together while he and I were still married which I thought was hilarious and disgusting. They finally broke up and he started dating someone else, who he eventually married. I had no bad feelings towards her bc she had nothing to do with our break-up. I was just so happy he didn't end up with the AP.\n\nSo I hear you and I understand how you feel. However, like others said, legally you can't keep the kids from seeing her. It sounds like he's not super interested in seeing the kids and just using you as an excuse to keep the drama going. Don't let him. Get a lawyer, get a parenting plan. This protects you and the kids. You can put in the part about \"no visitors can stay overnight unless married,\" but I personally wouldn't bc that might push them to get married. Best case scenario,  when AP doesn't have this drama to feed off of, she'll just leave. Maybe not, you may be stuck with her. Start living your own life. Get therapy, get meds if they might help, and take control of your own life. Put them in the rear view mirror and after awhile, you'll only think about them when you have to. Best of luck.

He is a shitty husband and obviously didn't deserve to be with you.

Even if stated in a custody agreement, it would be mutual that neither of you could bring significant others around the children. I can not see how that could be sustainable long-term.

In the state I live in the courts don\u2019t care about affairs etc. It is assumed it is in the best interest of the kids to have both parents. Which ever parent makes more pays the other one child support. They use a formula. He may have to pay her if he makes more but she will have zero say in what he does with who with her kids 50% of the time.

So far it looks like 50/50 might happen but since they couldn\u2019t reach an agreement during the mediation, they are going to do home evaluations and interview the kids.

I won't call you one, beacuse being betrayed like that is completely sucks and is unfair.\n\nBut I do think you should consider what is best for your kids and also what his parental rights are. It makes sense you don't want them around his mistress *emotionally,* but logically why not? Is she dangerous in some way? Is she worse then other women he could date? It seems like you're angry at the wrong person if you're blaming her for his cheating and saying they can't be around her.\n\nHe's your kids father. They're 11 and 8. Unless he's abusive, the best thing for them is to have a relationship with their father. When they are adults they can cut him off if they want, but right now if you encourage that you're doing them a disservice. They may regret this. And your daughter may feel she has to be loyal to you given how bitter and hateful towards the other women you seem to be. Do you think your kids would honestly feel that you'd be happy if they liked the other women? They don't want to hurt their mom. You're pulling them into your hurt, it's your job to convince them it's okay to love their Dad and it's okay to like his girlfriend and you won't be hurt by that (even if you will). \n\nThe reality is this is your husband's long term partner (at least for now). Your kids should be allowed around her. You're sabotaging your ex's relationship out of bitterness and using your kids to do it. \n\nSit your kids down and tell them that whatever happened between you and your dad, you know he loves them and you want them to have a good relationship with him. That if their relationship with dad dosen't work out that's okay, but you want them to give it a try and know you'll be happy if it does. Say that Dad's girlfriend has been with him a long time, so she seems like a likely long term partner to Dad, so avoiding her is not going to work. You know they saw how hurt you were (maybe just say this part to daughter, if she's the only one who caught on) but you promise you've worked on yourself and your feelings and you're okay with them knowing her now. You're okay with them liking her, if they like her. They don't have to like her, but if Dad wants them to be around her than as their Dad that's something they can choose. Neither of you, Dad or you, can choose their feelings. And whatever feelings they have are okay with you.
