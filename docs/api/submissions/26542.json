That he didn't then appeared to avoid you to hide it, shows that he knows it was shitty.\n\nEven if that wasn't the case, it's your body and you're allowed to tattoo whatever you want on it including covering up a previous tattoo.

You can hate it and tell him so but you can't demand he change it.", "NTA.  \n\n\nIf your dad won't explain things to you then he can't be surprised when you form your own conclusions.  \n\n\nAs for the tattoo, its your body. I know I wouldn't be happy having a tattoo that made me feel bad.  \n\n\nThat being said, it might be worth seeing if you can sit down with your dad and your mom to see if you can get some clarity on his troubling behavior to see if that changes how you feel about the tattoo cover up. I'm mostly thinking about the time and the cost and making sure you are very sure it is the right thing before spending the money on it.", "NTA.

He's being an ass.\n\nChanging the tat is a lifetime change; no need to rush.\n\nThe overarching issue is your dad's lack of effort and follow through to spend time with you. This is a patterned behavior for him. Mom made a suggestion to chat with him. 1) I'd want to know what transpired for him to support others getting the same tattoo when they are 100k+ options, 2) Why you and him don't have set dates/times to visit.\n\nThe tat is like a punch in the face overriding the many cuts of hurt he has delivered to you.", "NTA\n\nYou're old enough to know what you want to do.", "Nta  he brought it on himself", "NTA and I'm sorry you are going through this.

If he hurts your feelings, he can choose not to see you. If he hurts theirs, he has to endure what the results are.", "He likely faced pressure from new wife to get the tattoo to prove that she and her kids were as important to him as you.

Sadly, what I see from an outside looking in prospective is: he has moved on, new wife, new kids, new family, new life. Either he doesn't want you to be a part of this new chapter or his wife doesn't and he is letting her call the shots. To your dad and his shiny new family, your the left over. It's shitty and your dad is a total fool. I am sorry you are being treated this way. \n\nNTA, you dad is and so is his wife.", "NTA I would feel he cheapened the gesture/ moment. But your mum is right, sit downtalj to him raise your concerns.", "Info: I think the tattoo is not the real issue here, though I do think it's totally valid for you to be upset about the tattoo. \n\nI think the real issue is that you rightfully feel pushed aside by your dad for his new family and you want to take an action that will show him that. While I think you did great in the first phone call with asking questions instead of making accusations (that was a great first step for conflict resolution), next time you speak to your dad it should be to tell him how you feel about his lack of interest in you since starting his new family. \n\nIt would likely behoove you to write out what you want to say beforehand, like a letter. If you think he won't hear you out you can send it to him as a text, but it sounds like he at least let you talk and listened to what you were saying in your last call, even if he didn't seem willing to open up in the way you were hoping. I think you should just be upfront about how you've been feeling and maybe even what you think a potential solution could be. Something similar to this may work: \n\n\"Dad, I feel the need to share with you that I've really been feeling isolated from you lately. I love you and I love my new step-family, and I've been trying to be open and friendly when I'm around. But I still feel like you've been pulling away from me. I'm worried that that trend will continue, and I don't want to lose my relationship with you. I love you and I want to be part of your family because I am. Can you help me understand this vibe I've been getting that you don't want me around?\" \n\nYou can reword this to be more reflective of your feelings, but definitely stick to \"I feel\" statements, because thats the point of this convo, to share your feelings. I'm sorry you're dealing with this right now - I hope you and your dad can have a heart to heart and recapture your relationship.", "NTA / i\u2019m sorry he did that :((", "NTA. But, i think you should take your mom\u2019s advice and have a talk with your dad. The issue is not only the tattoo, but also him cancelling visitation with you.

Ask him if love for his children only exists if he's in a romantic relationship with their mom. Dont back down. If he cries, good. He needs a wake up call.", "Your Dad is the AH. I honestly question the maturity of a parent who would encourage a 16 year old to get a tattoo in the first place.", "NTA I'd get it covered, too. He has made it plain that a relationship with you is no longer any kind of priority for him.", "NTA, but he is for bailing on time with you. You\u2019re 18, time to cut the deadwood.\n\nEdit: spelling", "You are NTA for feeling the way you do. However, I also would not rush out and get the tattoo covered right away. I am not saying you can' t eventually, but you may want to give your dad a chance to make this up to you (which he should). You may regret it if you guys do end up talking it out.", "It may not be his choice that you are not included in the family anymore. My brother's wife refused to allow him to talk about his previous marriage or his first child. I started getting calls from the kids asking why I was hiding the fact I had an out-of-marriage child (I'm single) because they did a 23 and Me and found a \"brother or cousin\" and since he (my brother) is now dead, his wife told the kids his first child was actually my mistake. His wife is ultra-christian which is why she can't accept that my brother had a divorce, so it got \"eliminated\".", "NTA - I am guessing his new wife wants him to play dad to his step kids and doesn\u2019t want you around and he simply doesn\u2019t have the balls to stand up for you. \n\nI would try and have a conversation with him (face to face if it\u2019s even possible) but honestly I would get it covered too and then go no contact with my dad if he treated me like I was nothing, which is what he is doing by ignoring you and never explaining anything. It\u2019s either treats you like a young capable adult and try to get you to understand or he really doesn\u2019t want a relationship with you since he has two new kids. I\u2019m sorry, divorce is hard but this is just unacceptable.", "NTA\n\nyour parents are BOTH gaslighting you. Get your tattoo covered.

He blew you off and then tried to gaslight you into thinking you were being too sensitive.", "Nta, my best friend and i have matching tattoos. Idgaf how clichee that is, i would call her my sister even, she means so much to me. Anyway. This tatto is also pretty simple but for me its a symbol and theres no way i would get that same one with anyone else, no matter how close i am with the other person. It would have to be something else! This is what i dont get about your father, how could he disregard the meaning and connection that tattoo gave you two? I just dont understand it. It feels like a cheap gift that people get for everyone.", "Wow i feel bad for you. Everyone deserves a loving parent", "NTA. He's blowing you off and getting the same style tattoo with his new family. He's disrespectful", "NTA. I would get it covered too. You\u2019re not overreacting. I was in a blended family for a bit and it was the worst. Thankfully I got out of there at 18.", "NTA\n\nI think your father is selfish. A tattoo should mean a lot and it obviously does to you. It cheapens what you both had.\n\nSorry OP. I hope this situation gets better somehow", "It isn't complicated, your dad is just a fucking coward. His new wife doesn't want to see you because it makes her uncomfortable and he won't stand up for his own daughter, let alone his own interests in seeing you. Get the tattoo covered, your dad doesn't care enough to even set a reasonable boundary of, \"I want to see my daughter, and I don't want to have to hide her from you guys.

Take some time before deciding on the tattoo. Perhaps buy some decent makeup that will cover it and try that for a month it two to let your emotions settle before deciding. Try another conversation or write a letter to give him a chance to actually hear you. Realistically, spending all weekend every weekend with you is probably expecting too much, you are an adult, and he is an adult with other responsibilities and relationships.

That's how it works.", "I'd suggest giving your dad the benefit of the doubt, get together and hear what he has to say.

I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be the asshole to cover it up. But I would advise you to wait a little.

Your choice.\n\nI'm guessing he's trying to impress his new step kids by being the fun dad he was for you and thought he'd put in so the work he had to for your love.  Maybe he isn't even really aware of what he's doing. This taking a loved one for granted and fuzzy communication skills might be part of why your parents spilt. He should have given you advanced warning that he wanted to do some step-kid relationship building, was going to get an explanation to his tattoo to include his now bigger family, and felt he needed to give them a weekend off focused time, but that he still holds you dear to him.

Just not sure all the details are accurate. \n\nBut NTA. Parents can do dumb things. This kind of behaviour will see dad losing his relationship with his daughter permanently.", "WTP (Way Too Premature) - The problem isn't a tattoo, the problem is that your dad has a new family and you are resenting that the special 1 to 1 that you used to have is gone. One weekend is way to soon to justify the hassle and expense of removing a tattoo. The removal of which is only accelerating the separation that you don't want.\n\nA sit down talk with your dad is the minimum that you should have, even if you decide to remove the tattoo.", "Get it covered. It's tainted now. NTA", "NAH. Listen to your mother (in this case, at least).", "NTA for your feelings, but I think your mum is right. You need to sit down and talk things out with your father, this is a bigger issue than just a tattoo.", "INFO (?) (I think both of you are being very mildly selfish, but not to the point of being assholes, just being humans)\n\nYou are allowed to feel this way. But I don't think his tat is what makes him an asshole. Tats are very much a personal thing, and while the feelings of other members of a tat \"pact\" should be accounted for, ultimately your tat is yours and his tat is his. To him, his new family might be comparatively important in his life as you are, and thus it makes sense to commemorate them in a similar way. Not to mention, there is always the inclination for someone to try to keep a consistent aesthetic between their tattoos. Either way, while your feelings should have factored in and it would have been polite for him to ask you first, ultimately it is not your body, nor your relationships that this is about.\n\nI am also going to note that you are 18 and an adult now. While it would be nice for him to keep honoring your court-appointed hang time if that worked for both of you, that routine was defined by custody orders that should no longer be in effect. Technically you two can hang whenever you want now, so I think it is unfair to hold him to that particular schedule.\n\nI don't have enough information to make much of a judgment here. On the one hand it seems like he still considers your relationship important enough to match your tattoo, and I am inclined to believe that. On the other hand, I have no idea why he would be deprioritizing his time with you on weekends.\n\n* It could be something as innocent as just being tired of that particular routine and wanting to forge something different with your relationship--is he still making efforts to hang with you otherwise?\n* It could be a bit murkier that now that you are of age he is free to more fully enjoy his new life and is sort of \"moving past\" you and your mom now that custody is no longer an issue. I.e., it's not necessarily that he doesn't like you, just that his new family represents a new life that he overall enjoys more.\n* It could be that we aren't getting the whole story and that, for one reason or another, he doesn't want to be around you (or reminders of his relationship with your mother) anymore/as much. And that might be due to things \\*he\\* did, or your mother did, or even things you did (although based on the tattoo I am guessing it's probably not you).\n\nI think a frank conversation with him is merited, but I would also not expect a totally satisfying answer. What this all reads to me as is that you are a central figure of a \"former self\" that he, at least to some extent, wants to move past or compartmentalize/recontextualize. And that is sad and to some extent makes him an asshole, but a LOT people do things like this. They move into new chapters of their life without fully embracing or acknowledging their past relationships, and oftentimes specifically \\*because\\* they did a poor job respecting those relationships and want to escape to start anew. My gut tells me this is much more a thing about him trying to move past whatever went down with your mom than it has to do with you.\n\nAnyway, sorry you have to be dealing with this at a pivotal point in your life. Being 18 is stressful, almost universally, with varying degrees of additional family baggage. But I don't think it is totally unsalvageable. You two were clearly very close, and I am assuming that since his tat quite abjectly places you in equity with his new family, that he still cares a lot about you. As far as we can tell, **he's not getting rid of your tattoo**. If you can set aside your instinctive jealousy and accept that your father is also a growing, changing person, there may still be plenty of room for you in his life.", "YTA I think you are angry and hurt about something besides the tattoo, and are trying to hurt him.

Ideally he will discuss it with you like an adult.  \n\nAt least when you know what is going on you can then deal with it head on. \n\nAs to the tattoo after you meet with your dad then you can decide what action you want to take.  Perhaps if you do decide to cover it a skilled tattoo artist could turn it into something else that speaks to you.", "Very interesting that your mother is trying to help you maintain a relationship with your father when he isn't making any effort at all.   \nI agree with you, that tattoo was supposed to mean something special to you as father/daughter. NTA.  \nBut I also agree with your mother, you need to sit him down and get some straight answers. Tell him it's obvious he's pushing you out of his life and you want to know why. Also find out why he doesn't want you to associate with him and his new family, the usual problem is parents trying to force a relationship.", "He could\u2019ve gotten a different style if he wanted, still would\u2019ve been uncool on his part to ditch you this way.\n\nWith the same style it\u2019s just plain out disrespectful \n\nNTA.", "Nta.

I'm sorry.", "[removed]", "NTA, and good on you for standing up for yourself at such a young age.\n\nTwo recommendations though: first, listen to your mom and talk it out.  You've come this far, finish the job.  Second: wait a few weeks after the conversation to get the ink if you decide to follow through.  This is no different than getting any regular tattoo, you don't want to do this while drunk, high, upset, or otherwise have possibly impaired judgement.", "NTA, at all. It sounds like his family is making it difficult for him to include you. It's not ok for him to placate that. I imagine it's a really hard spot to be in but he's making the wrong choice there. \n\nPlease take some time to consider the cover-up. Maybe add something to it to make it special to the parts of the relationship you loved, incorporate other parts of your life that you love - or just something you find beautiful -  flowers, trees, hearts & swirls? Add to it so that it's still there for you but not discernable as a matching tattoo. \n\nThe strain you're feeling right now won't last forever. Your dad won't be around forever. The love that existed when you got tattoos together - that's still there, that will always be there.", "NTA but maybe meet with your dad and MAKE him tell you why he's being weird. Don't let him give you the run around on this. He has to tell you why he doesn't want you around his new family or at least let him explain his behavior.

Tattoos usually hold great significance and are extremely sentimental, this was exactly the case when you and your dad got your tattoos and he just shit on that. He could have gotten any other style but he decided to spoil the style you both shared and polluted it. He has spoiled the memory and the sentiment, it's meaningless now. Your feelings of betrayal are completely valid, most people speak at length about the tattoos they are thinking of getting, he obviously knew it would bother you because he kept it secret from you. The shared aspect of your tattoo is gone, looking at it is now just a reminder of hurt feelings and betrayal, you should get it covered with something that brings you happiness, or have it removed entirely.", "NTA - I think your dad was an a\\*\\*hole for encouraging you to get a major tattoo when you were under 18.  I don't blame you for wanting to get rid of it.", "Nta, get it covered. Removal ofc an option if you could as well", "NTA. Also, a little weird that he got pictures of his nearly adult step children that he must have known less than three years permanently engraved into his skin. Just strikes me as odd.

I\u2019d talk to your dad in person first about the current issues at hand and what your relationship looks like going forward. It\u2019s hard but better than being justifiably reactionary. You\u2019re way more mature than I was at 18.", "NTA. But i think you should know that this comes across pretty clearly in your retelling that your dads new wife doesnt want you around. \n\nThis is a reach but she could dislike that youre the same age as her own daughter and wants your dad to focus only on his \u201cnew\u201d family", "I'm just sitting here wondering who thinks getting a tattoo with their 16 year old is a good idea?", "NTA, but you already know that. \n\nBased on what you described, it likely wouldn\u2019t be a hard coverup. Some pretty black & gray flowers maybe?", "Sit down and talk, your NTA, what you are is hurt, and its understandable. You feel as if you are being left out from his life, and if you feel like that, it's your truth. Don't cover your tattoo, one day it will mean more to you than it does right now. There is always makeup to cover it for now. Tell your dad how you're feeling, that you miss him and you want to spend time with him, and that you should be around his stepkids since they are in his life as well, ask him if he really doesn't want you around them or if it's just something you're feeling which may not be the case but if he doesn't want you around, why?  I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope that you and your dad can work it out.", "NTA for how you feel at all.  Please realize that you are an adult now and there is no more visitation (unless your custody order states otherwise).  You need to sit down and discuss how everything is going to work now that you are an adult.

Give it some time before deciding to cover the tattoo (that is a lot of time and money to cover it up!) There is a show called tattoo nightmares you should watch. That way you can see how they cover up the bad tattoos. You want a tattoo artist experienced in fixing bad tattoos. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t cover it up. I\u2019m saying be very sure and get it done right. \n\nAs for your dad, I suggest telling him you will only put in the same amount of effort that he does. That maybe in a year you will think about seeing him in person, to see if he can not stand you up.  Then stick to phone calls, texts and video calls\u2026. And only putting in an equal amount of effort. (I did this with an x-bf and it was eye opening how little effort he gave. Then I made him an X \ud83d\ude08) \n\nIf he tries to excuse his behavior (something came up) calmly ask him what exactly came up. Insist on details. Then calmly ask him why that was more important then spending time with you like you both planned on? Ask him if he had a scheduling conflict, why he didn\u2019t call days ahead and arrange for you to meet up on a different day?

If you want to cover it, get it covered.", "NTA, but I would wait to get the tattoo covered for a long bit to see how you feel about it.

Only thing not allowed is a \u201cjobstopper\u201d  (hands, face, neck etc.) At 16, you don\u2019t even need permission anymore, and you can get any tattoo you want.\n\nYes, even I as a tattoo artist think this is absolutely ridiculous as well. I have a very firm personal age limit and won\u2019t tattoo anyone younger than 18, parental permission or not. But according to the law I\u2019m allowed.", "Some places it is legal at 16 with parental consent. Since dad has a matching tattoo, I would assume that may be the case", "In my state you can get a tattoo under 18 with parental permission.", "minors can get tattoos with parental consent.", "I agree with this. It's completely reasonable for you to be hurt that your dad cancelled your weekend like that. It sounds like you're still in high school, but legally an adult, so I'd recommend talking with both your parents about what that means (since custody agreements normally end with adulthood). It also sounds like he's having trouble blending the families together. Not sure if family therapy might help get to the bottom/work through this but it might be a start.", "i never pushed him to meet every weekend for three years. when one of us had a reason, we didn't meet anyway or met another day. still, if he's bored with this routine, i think he needs to tell me straight. because it's heartbreaking when he just says he's busy and hangs out with his family and then just tells me \"it's not that simple\". and no, he didn't take much action to make up for the less attention he gave me after the marriage.\r\n\nthere is no problem between him and my mom right now, they don't talk unless it's necessary. so i don't think he is moving away because of mom.\r\n\nit's also the saddest thing for me that he's enjoying life to the fullest now that i'm of legal age. maybe i'm speaking emotionally but it means that i'm a kind of prison for him. i don't want to think that he's been spending time with me because he \"has to\".\r\n\ni will talk to him, if he wants to move on to a new chapter of his life and give me less scene there he must say it clearly. thank you so much", "btw, it is very difficult for me to change my mind about tattoo because aesthetics is not really an excuse. there were so many tat that he could have done without ruining the aesthetics of his body\n\nit's so okay to get one for his family, but i think he could have done it without messing something special between the two of us", "hard to talk to someone who is actively avoiding them. maybe he deserves to have his feelings hurt. he threw op aside for his do over family, so he can deal with the consequences", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Even in backwards assed South Carolina where tattooing was illegal until 2004, minors can get one with parental consent.  I think it's 16 as well.", "That is definitely a...discrepancy...that I also had trouble reconciling. He has a matching tattoo with you, but is now spending less time with you, and roughly around the time that custody is no longer in effect. Was it to some extent a \"prison\" for him? Was it always that way (I can't really accept that theory, again the tattoo), or only recently when he found another family to invest in that didn't have all that weird divorce and time-gating stuff attached to it? If so, I do think he should be noticed that you deserve some transparency on all of that, since absent an explanation that's just relationship whiplash and could easily manifest as trauma for you.\n\nIt does sound like he and your mom don't have much fondness for each other. I don't want to be needlessly speculating, but just because they have a tenuous peace/equilibrium now doesn't mean whatever went on between them is resolved. And while I don't think it's fair to you to have to shoulder any of that...it is very easy and common for the adjacent relationships to be affected by deep rifts if they happened.\n\nThe thought did occur to me that your father's compartmentalization of his families could break down quite a bit now that you are not subject to your mother's custody and are a free agent. I.e., you could theoretically meet his new family and maybe become less associated with the \"old\" and more associated with the \"new\". But that will be very much up to what your father wants, and I think you are being very mature in recognizing the possibility that he may not elect to do that. And it also depends on how comfortable you are being the rogue mercenary in all of this and dealing with potential pressure to be a double or triple agent (I have no idea how invested your mother is or could get in all of this). But might be worth mulling over.\n\nBest of luck, friend.", "In a way this is very polyamorous \"hinge\" flavored. I.e., it seems that from your father's perspective he's in two equal relationships (if we are going by the tattoos). But what feels equal to a hinge can feel very lopsided or disrespectful to a non-hinge partner. Many relationships of all kinds fall into arrangements like this, and I do think it is important for the \"endpoints\" to assert themselves and make sure they are not pouring themselves into what might just be the leftovers of someone's attention.\n\nYou may be right about aesthetics, especially if he has multiple tattoos. But then if that's the case, choosing to link these two tattoos by the same aesthetic may mean something to him. I can't really say whether it needed to be this way or could have been adequately represented by two different styles, but it seems a fundamental part of the tattoo choice was his mental connection between those relationships and how much they all mean to him. And I feel like that's not a wholly evil thing: maybe a bit myopic and possibly even confused, but I can't really find any malice behind it. The same evidence that points at carelessness also points at care, even if it may have been misguided.\n\nUltimately, just as it is his decision to get another tattoo, it is your decision to remove  yours. If you don't think the relationship merits that particular tattoo anymore from your end of things, I think it makes quite a lot of sense to remove it. And maybe you will reach an even more decisive position on whether to do that after speaking with him. But as long as you are still seeking to maintain your relationship with your father, bear in mind two things:\n\n1. He still has not removed his tattoo, and if anything has doubled down on it by replicating it. So however close you may feel to him after all of this, he may still care very much about you and want to maintain this relationship.\n2. Be aware that you removing your tattoo will send a far stronger message to him than his new tattoo sends to you. His tattoo may communicate a certain degree of dilution, but not total erasure; your hurt is definitely of a sort of diminishment or deprioritization, but you are still there among the tattoos. I don't know how he may take the removal of your tattoo, but I don't think it is incorrect at all to predict that he could interpret it as total denial/cutting off of that relationship and what that tattoo represented. Just be very careful here...if you do intend to go through with it, I would consider letting him know beforehand. If you feel you can, clarify that it's not about you invalidating the relationship, but you needing to take something off your body that is just charged with a lot of negative emotions.", "Well, as long as you thought that. Where I am, it's illegal to tattoo children, but it may be different where you are.", "OP is his daughter.", "Haha that\u2019s where I grew up and was basing that info on! Think NC may have the same 16 with consent rule too", "Oops. Changing"]}
