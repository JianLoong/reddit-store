Julie and I split up when the kids were in elementary school due to her infidelity, but we\u2019ve remained cordial in an attempt to be good co-parents. James and Nina both moved out after highschool, but Cody splits his time between mine and Julie\u2019s houses. Another thing to note, Cody is transgender. He was assigned female at birth and began his social transition when he was 15. Most everyone in his life supported and accepted him, everyone except his cousin Nate (18m).\n\nNate is Julie\u2019s nephew; the son of her sister Amber. When Cody first went to one of Julie\u2019s family event as a boy, Nate berated and insulted Cody to the point of tears, until James and Nina shouted back at him and drove Cody home. According to them, Nate said some really vile things that I\u2019m not going to repeat here, but suffice it to say that since then, all three of my kids have refused to go to any event with Nate present. \n\nFlash forward to last month. Cody came back from his mom\u2019s place and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s been crying. I ask him what\u2019s wrong, and after a little prodding, he tells me that his mom wants him to go to his cousin Hannah\u2019s blowout sweet 16. (Hannah is Nate\u2019s younger sister, and I later confirmed with Julie that he would be there) and that\u2019s she\u2019s threatening to take away access to his car (that I got him for his own 16th) if he doesn\u2019t comply. \n\nI messaged Julie to get her side of the story, and apparently Amber wants to try to make things better between Cody and Nate, and is insisting that Julie bring him. Julie also said that she\u2019s \u201ctired of [deadname]- I mean Cody being so dramatic about this whole thing. It\u2019s been two years, time to forgive and forget.\u201d\n\nCody then asks me if he could move in with me full time (the custody agreement says that he can decide which parent he lives with and the car is in my name). I say yes and Cody goes up to his room. I then message Julie to let her know the situation, and she blows up at me, accusing me of \u201cshutting her out of Cody\u2019s life\u201d and \u201cundermining her ability to parent\u201d. I try to stay calm and let her know I\u2019d be coming over to get Cody\u2019s stuff. I drive over to pick up his stuff, and she tries to deny me access, but I threaten to call the cops because she\u2019s trying to infringe on the custody agreement. (Not sure if it would\u2019ve worked, but she bought it and I got all of his stuff without further issue). \n\nCody is now settled in at my place and the party came and went, but I\u2019ve been getting messages from her trying to set up a meeting with Cody and I. (I asked Cody and he said no). She seems so sad and desperate, and also very angry with me, and I\u2019m starting to doubt my judgment. \n\nAITA for letting him move in with me full time, skip the party, and keep his car?", "created_utc": 1681156275, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12htyq2/aita_for_letting_my_son_skip_his_cousins_party/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't force your kid into a situation with a known bully.\n\nYour ex wife clearly wants to be a part of Cody's life and will hopefully realize her mistake quickly. I get that she wants everyone in the extended family to get along, but at what cost? I hope she apologizes to Cody and ya'll can be on good terms again.", "NTA Julie should have supported Cody and stood her ground with Amber. That being said, if you can facilitate a conversation between Cody and Julie, it would probably benefit all of you.", "NTA, if your ex wants to follow the status quo that's totally fine... For her. Trying to force everyone else to do it too is wild. And now it's cost her a child, she'll probably never get over this but your son is safe and happy now so who cares.", "As someone under the trans umbrella, absolutely NTA. I think you\u2019re doing a wonderful job, and i wish more trans kids had parents like you. You are not harming cody\u2019s relationship with his mother; she is. When nate was saying all those hateful things to Cody to begin with, where tf was she and why did it fall on your two older children to stand up for him? \n\nYou\u2019re evidently a great parent, and my advice is to keep doing what you\u2019re doing.\n\nAnd as a trans person i must include the obligatory advice of: dont let cody bind with athletic tape.", "NTA. Your first and primary duty is to protect your kid. Your ex didn't and now she's reaping the consequences.", "Nta youre being a good father to your kid but to outsiders look like you managed to turn your kid against his mom to get them on your side\n\nThats life. Kids will choose\n\nParents will be parents\n\nShe made undestandable mistakes. Oh well", "NTA, all the way. You can't force two people to reconcile as outside observers, Cody and Nate would need to come together on their own through Nate reaching out and atoning for his actions. That the moms are trying to force it to the ends that Julie has decided to impose, tells me Nate's not interested and the Mom's think its more important. \n\nOne thing though is that at some point there might have to be a conversation about everything. It's the first step to setting boundaries: spelling out why their behavior cannot be tolerated and what is and isn't ok. Now may not be the time but it will need to be done at some point.", "NTA. You are doing a great job parenting and protecting your child from the family bully and his protectors. Too bad your ex has her head up her ass and cannot do the same. It\u2019s on her to find a way to rebuild the relationship with Cody.", "NTA\n\nOf course you're not the AH.  Julie needs to re-think her relationship with Cody and her own feelings.  She (and Amber) also need to have a think about this whole \"its been two years, Cody should get over it\" strategy - and who in their right mind would even think doing it a 16 year olds birthday party is a good idea!!!\n\nAlso a quick shout out to James and Nina for sticking up for their little sibling!", "Cody needs to feel save and secure. His mom was bullying (taking away the car OP gave him) Cody into spending time with his bully: cousin Nate.\n\nCody turned to OP for help. \n\nOP provided help and a save and secure home surrounding.\n\nOP is respecting Cody's wishes\n\nOP: NTA", "NTA. You protected Cody. You did your job perfectly, as his dad. \n\nJulie was the one that caused problems in their relationship, with her actions. And she is the one facing the consequences now. \n\nCody doesn\u2019t want to see her. And that\u2019s completely fine. Julie tried to use coercion to force Cody to that party. It backfired on her. \n\nGive Cody some time to cool off, and then let him know he can tell you when or if he wants to see Julie. Tell Julie that you are not going to jeopardize your relationship with Cody to help her. This is her screw up. She should have thought ahead.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Not by a long chalk. If I were your kid, I\u2019d think you were the best dad ever!! \n\nTo ever deadname a person is **disgusting to the nth degree**. Amber is severely at fault here for such blatant disrespect. Gotta wonder where Nate got it from \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nIn time, I would try to facilitate Cody and Julie having a conversation. In the long run, it would be beneficial to you all. Even if Cody walks away from that conversation and says \u201cI don\u2019t think we should talk anymore\u201d then at least he has tried. \n\nIMO, you haven\u2019t undermined Julie. You\u2019ve taken onboard what has happened, how your son feels about it all, and you have given him what he wanted and what ultimately sounds best all around: living with you. \n\nThe \u2018Julie wanting to take away access to the car\u2019 is incidental in all this, and now doesn\u2019t matter one way or the other. But she should use this time away from Cody to have a long, hard think about why her son wouldn\u2019t want to live with her anymore. And Cody should use this time to think about how to have a meaningful relationship with his mother going forward, and if that\u2019s even possible. You can\u2019t force him either way. He\u2019s 17, practically an adult. \n\nOn an aside: I want to commend you on being such a fully supportive dad. I hear too many stories where transgender teens (and adults) fall through the cracks or get kicked out of home, have nowhere to turn, nobody to turn to. You supporting your son is the best thing I\u2019ve come across on Reddit today. And social media in general. \nI know you don\u2019t need congratulating on something you do so freely and willingly, but as someone with a child in the LGBTQ+ community, it just makes my heart happy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s stuck in the past, and now that the two oldest have moved out and have limited contact, she\u2019s holding on tight to the last vestiges of her \u2018babies\u2019. This was also an issue when the kids were starting school, and again when they were getting to be more independent as teenagers. Cody\u2019s always gotten the brunt of it as the youngest. Her emotional immaturity was the other big reason I left her, besides her cheating of course."]}
