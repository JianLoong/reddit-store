Young women are constantly being exploited in the industry everyday and it can be very dangerous. Moreover the chances of Paige having the same level of success as Anne are very, very low. Also for the people saying that Paige is an adult, ask yourself what 19 year old wouldn\u2019t want to pursue a job that seems minimal effort for high benefits, with a success story right in-front of her face advocating for her to do it?

Yes, your sister is technically an \"adult\" as some people have been kind enough to mention. However, the reality is that she's a 19 year old college student. Whether or not some people want to acknowledge this, your sister is still a kid in many ways.

She\u2019s 19. If she doesn\u2019t need to do it, she shouldn\u2019t. Because it\u2019s all fun and games until she\u2019s in her 40s and her high school aged child is getting bullied because her onlyfans is circulating.

I don't see adult entertainment as a lifestyle - let alone as an unhealthy choice. Your sister is capitalizing and  commoditizing herself in a manner not unheard of, after all. \n\nSo, because your sister is an adult, I believe that these choices, no matter who suggests them, are only hers to make. \n\nIf you feel that Anne is exploiting your little sister or being disrespectful of her humanity - then tell her that. And tell her you have lost your appetite for her because you find her personality to be offensive. That's the real deal. You just don't like who Anne is.

No two ways about that.", "Further clarification is needed. Is your sister hot?", "YTA, your sister is an adult, and she is telling you she can make her own decisions, so let her. What are you worried about here? Do you think it's wrong to do sex work? Or just wrong for your sister to do sex work? If we took the sex out of it and she was just doing Influencer stuff, would that make it better? You say you try to support your roommate when she talks about it, but now you won't even try with your sister? Seems odd to me.", "YTA - just because you\u2019re prude doesn\u2019t mean your sister or your friends have to be. Your sister and Anne are adults and can make their own decisions.", "YTA. Anne didn't pressure her into it or coerce her, she just explained what she does and how it's successful for her, and that your sister could also be successful in it. Your sister is an adult capable of making her own decisions and doesn't need you to helicopter over her and censor what she hears from other people. \n\nIt just sounds like you have a bias against what Anne does and you don't want to admit it. \n\nI do online sex work and started when I was 19. I'm in my mid 20s now. Yes, I do feel more mature and aware of the world as I have gotten older, but I don't think 19 is still a child or is incapable of making that choice in the slightest.

To pay medical bills. To save money in hopes of digging themselves out of whatever hole society has chucked them in. \n\nIf sex workers didn't have a market, they wouldn't exist. If you're mad at sex work, call out the consumers. Call out people who objectify and prey on the vulnerable.

Some people are fuckin good at it and enjoy it. Usually the ones who enjoy it are people doing things like Onlyfans or something where they aren't having physical contact with anyone they don't actually want to, if I'm sharing my personal experience. \n\nThat being said, yeah, some people don't mind the idea of strangers jerking off to them and are pretty good at making money off of said strangers. But it's absolutely not for everyone and I think it's something that is more often than not pushed at young people now as an \"easy way\" to make money (which it is absolutely not). Younger people don't grasp the mental consequences (and sometimes life altering consequences) of online sex work until they're in it.", "What I meant by safe means was the production part. Clearly being in sex work isn't entirely safe even though it should be, as long as the worker isn't being exploited, forced etc. Unfortunately it's still not as safe as it should be. It shouldn't affect ones life in means of career advancement, it shouldn't be used to stalk or harass the worker either. Unless they are actively creating content in a inappropriate area (such as a school, or church or something that shouldn't be used for that. It's why you set up a room at home in that style etc). While it's physically safer (until you get that one asshole who has to be a creep) of course it has its negative drawbacks \n\nAnd as for my statement regarding porn it was in relation to the first commenter going with more of a \"film\" style aka actual video footage which is based on \"real life\" not that half the porn videos out on the web are actually \"real life\" not every pool boy is trying to get with a housewife and so forth. And not more of the whole \"still life\" setting aka photos. \n\nThey gave off the vibe that they thought she was encouraging the sister to be a porn actress not just a  only fans worker etc. Cause if she was encouraging the porn star/actress then she should also encourage if not straight up demand that they do their due diligence in research.

Fifty-seven percent reported that they had been sexually assaulted as children and 49% reported that they had been physically assaulted as children. As adults in prostitution, 82% had been physically assaulted; 83% had been threatened with a weapon; 68% had been raped while working as prostitutes; and 84% reported current or past homelessness.\u201d \n\n\u201cOf the 130 people interviewed, 68% met DSM III-R criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. Eighty-eight percent of these respondents stated that they wanted to leave prostitution, and described what they needed in order to escape.\u201d \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9698636/\n\nOld study coming up: \nThey followed up with sex workers 15 years later: \n\n\u201cThe majority (73/124, 59%) were still in the sex industry and had sold sex for a mean of 13.6\u2005years. There were six deaths, a mortality of 4.8 per 1000 person years. Surviving women had a high cumulative risk (110 of 118, 93%) of STI. Past gonorrhoea was associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.66) and infertility (RR 10.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 77.3). Other outcomes included mental health problems (38 of 97, 40%) and addiction (46 of 72, 64%). There were no significant differences in health outcomes between women who were still in the sex industry and those who had stopped.\u201d\n\nDifferent study: \n\n\u201cAs children, the adult film performers were more likely to have been victims of forced sex (37% compared with 13% of CWHS respondents), to have lived in poverty (24% and 12%), and to have been placed in foster care (21% and 4%) (p<.01). In the past 12 months, 50% of the performers reported living in poverty and 34% reported experiencing domestic violence, compared with 36% and 6%, respectively, of CWHS respondents (p<.01). As adults, 27% had experienced forced sex, compared with 9% of CWHS respondents (p<.01). Female adult film performers have significantly worse mental health and higher rates of depression than other California women of similar ages.\u201d", "Thank you for your edit, but of course it feels invalidating.\n\nI am not ignorant to the dangers of my industry. I am more informed than you can possibly imagine about the factors that often lead to someone joining the industry. I am in the industry, after all. \n\nThe dangers and the factors that commonly lead to participation in the industry have absolutely no bearing on what I've discussed. It doesn't matter how we got here, some people thrive in the industry, some people hate it, and some people feel like a job's a job. \n\nYes, trauma, addiction and mental illness are everywhere in this industry, but overwhelmingly, they are the reason it's a job that works for us, not the job causing the issue.\n\nYes, violence is epidemic, and almost all of us experience it. This is an issue of stigma and a lack of legal protection. It is borderline socially acceptable to abuse us. We have empirical data to demonstrate that in areas where sex work is decriminalised, rates of assault drop. When sex work is decriminalised, we are also more likely to have the avenues and resources required to exit the industry if desired. \n\nBottom line, it's not the services we offer that cause us harm, generally speaking. When we are legally protected and socially accepted, and we discount forced participation in the industry (because that's sex slavery, not sex work), you get a very different picture."]}
