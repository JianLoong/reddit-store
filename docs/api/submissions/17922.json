Rachel and I have the same mom while Regina and I have the same dad. I grew up with Rachel so for many years I was closer to her as opposed to the sister I wasn't even aware of until I was 5, didn't meet until I was 7 and only saw during the occasional Spring Break/Summer when our paternal grandmother would have us. It wasn't until I was in high school that I grew closer to Regina. She helped me through something she also experienced while Rachel thought it wasn't a big deal and eventually told me to \"get over it.\"\n\nWe eventually Rachel and I patched things up but our relationship was never the same. Especially since she never gave me the apology I feel like I was owed for trying to invalidate my feelings. I started hanging around Regina more and due to this she and Rachel would occasionally cross paths. Regina used to date \"Jaxon\" (28m) and he cheated on her with Rachel. There was a huge blowout and thankfully Regina believed me and over time we were back on good terms.\n\nI just couldn't believe that Rachel would be this type of person and I called her out about it several times. I accused her of not having the best morals which prompted her to reveal that if it weren't for people like her and Jaxon I wouldn't exist. I was confused about what she meant and that's when our mom admitted that my dad was still technically with Regina's mom when she started a relationship with him. I was floored but I did shut up.\n\nA few weeks later invitations for Jaxon and Rachel's wedding were sent out and I didn't get one. I can admit that while a part of me was hurt at not getting an invite, another part of me wasn't sure I'd attend. Opted to just not say any, ignored any in-person conversations about Rachel's wedding around me, and unfollowed/unfriended Rachel when the timeline became flooded with wedding related stuff. A few months ago tickets went on sale for a very popular artist and asked me if I was interested. We got some amazing seats and are planning to drive out together over the weekend for the concert. This is the same weekend as Rachel's wedding and after Regina made a post about it Rachel immediately called me up and berated me for choosing to go to a concert instead of her wedding. I reminded her that I never got invited so Rachel made a big show about giving me one and now members of the family are telling me that I have to attend my \"only\" sister's wedding.\n\nHowever, the way I see it is that Rachel either didn't want me there until she knew I was going to do something with Regina or was waiting for me to beg and cry for an invitation. Either way Rachel spent the better part of a year planning a wedding and is only now inviting me a few weeks prior so AITA?  \n\n\nETA: Since someone either commented or messaged me about this\n\n1. Yes, several relatives knew that I wasn't invited and a few of them did go to Rachel about this and from what I heard the reason why she didn't initially invite me was because I was so open about my dislike for the groom. Which is one of the reasons why I think she was waiting for me to come to her begging. \n2. Regina blocked Rachel on everything two years ago so I don't know how she found out as quickly as she did. Like, Rachel called me within a couple hours.", "created_utc": 1684772184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ovciq/aita_for_choosing_to_go_to_a_concert_instead_of/", "score": 338, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
