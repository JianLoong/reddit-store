Besides the fact I feel like it is tacky to host my own shower and basic tell people \"hey buy me stuff\" it is a ton of work. I decided not to do a baby shower because when I attempted to do a small gathering for a gender reveal not a single person I invited came, not even my best friend. I decided then and there, after much crying, I would not set myself up for the same disappointment and instead bought everything myself or with gift money from coworkers and one really good friend of mine. At this point I now have everything I need and there is absolutely no reason to have a shower. I am being told that I should do a shower or atleast do something after the baby gets here because every baby should be celebrated and I basically feel like people around me are trying to force me into some sort of party that I don't want the headache of dealing with. \n\nSo AITA for not wanting to host a party in my and my future child's honor?\n\nEdit- got told I should add this in\nThe gender reveal was a surprise type of thing. I had invited everyone over under the pretext of seeing our new home and having lunch with us. It was supposed to be a rather relaxed, no gifts expected thing where everyone got to check out our new house and eat some food then I was going to announce we were expecting and the sex since we had the results. We wanted to tell our closest friends and family at the same time rather than upset anyone because one person found out before someone else. \n\nNo my family is not the greatest nor are my friends. I have not been checked on by any of my family in the 4/5 months they have known. I don't have much family and the little bit I do have is not very supportive nor involved in our lives.\n\nThis is also my second child, even more reason to not throw myself a shower in my eyes", "created_utc": 1695351452, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oz88y/aita_for_not_hosting_my_own_baby_shower/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one is obligated to throw any kind of party.", "NTA\n\nThese people in your life are morons.\n\nThis is your second child, as you said in the comments, so lots of people don't do a shower after their first. Does anyone actually think that without a shower your child won't be celebrated?  Do what is best for you and that sounds like not putting yourself through the stress and expense just to please other people.", "In my experience, it does appear as a gift grab if you host your own shower. If others feel it is so necessary, they can host one for you.\n\nSimply enjoy your pregnancy, and look forward to the new life ahead. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nThey want a party? They can host it themselves.\nNo one can force you.\n\nAnd after what happened with the baby reveal? Dear, you have good reason to tell them to f*** off.\n\nAfter having the baby you'll be way too focused and tired to be having a party.

It's entirely your choice!\n\nETA: I saw below that this is your second child. I don't think it's common to have a shower for a second baby, so you definitely don't have to.

If people want to celebrate your baby, they should host a shower for you.", "NTA. You celebrate a baby by loving it and caring for it.

It's not about forcing a party on you, it's about celebrating a significant milestone in your life. Your decision not to host a baby shower may come across as ungrateful to those who care about you and want to share in your joy. It's not tacky to accept support from loved ones.

Also, this could be a great opp for your husband to organize something special for you, and he could even work with your close friend to do it but again it\u2019s kinda awkward to ask someone to throw a party for you.

It would be very tacky for me to organise it myself. Almost one of the first things my friends said after I told them I was pregnant was offer to organize the shower for me.", "I'm just getting told from several people at this point that I should do one and that all babies should celebrated and why won't I do it and on and on and I've gotten to the point I've started to question if I was right in my refusal.

Yes my last was born almost 10 years ago so I had no baby stuff left from him but still, I don't need a shower for this child and I don't need the headache to pulling one together either.

This is completely irrelevant.", "They didn't know it was a gender reveal. I know reddit hates gender reveals but it wasn't some huge thing. It was literally open an email and read the blood testing they did for genetic issues, but it also had the sex on there so we were going to find out regardless. I invited just a few close family members and a single friend. Wasn't planning to burn down the state or anything lol", "Wow, bad experiences? What does it have to do with what OP asks?", "If they want to celebrate they can throw the party. That\u2019s literally the most common etiquette for these things, especially baby showers. And in my experience if I want to get someone I love/care about a gift I don\u2019t need a party to do so. I just get them the gift. I\u2019ve had friends who chose not to have a baby shower at all and I still went to their house with a gift to welcome their new baby. \nFor example - my husband and I eloped in another state. No one was invited. My parents were thrilled. They threw us a pre wedding shower and a post wedding celebration and my family came and gave gifts and were excited to celebrate us. \nMy husbands family didn\u2019t throw us a party and we didn\u2019t get any gifts from them \u201cbecause there wasn\u2019t a wedding\u201d. We don\u2019t have a good relationship with them to start, so I don\u2019t mind. I just find the mentality that an event has to happen to give gifts. \nTo me gift giving is unconditional. It doesn\u2019t matter if I get to go to a party and eat a $10 plate of food.", "I wouldn't have minded if they wanted to host it, even if they hosted it at my home. It's just tacky to me to host my own shower, even more so for a second baby, and emotionally if people bailed again, I would be devastated again. \n\nIf any of them had shown the least amount of support it might be different but given no one has called and checked up on me a single time, well, I don't have much support. Unrelated, but my Aunt and uncle recently came to my home to the first time and we have been here over 6 months and live 20 minutes from them. There wasn't a single positive word said, and the only reason they came was because my cousin wanted to host a birthday dinner for them but my uncle's mom can't get into my cousin's house, but my house is wheelchair accessible.", "And congratulations \ud83d\udc4d", "You\u2019ll surely celebrate your child by loving him/her and providing for his/her basic needs. That\u2019s what babies really care about.", "are those the people that didnt come to the gender reveal? just tell them, you dont want to host another party they wont shoe up to.", "Babies don\u2019t need to be \u201ccelebrated\u201d. Babies do not GAF if you throw an entire parade in their honor. They are babies. \n\n\u201cCelebrate\u201d the kid in a couple years when they actually know what\u2019s going on and can have fun. It\u2019s called a birthday party.", "Then they should throw it since they're so hung up on it.", "The correct answer is \"I really wish you had been at the gender reveal party, we celebrated my new baby the day I revealed them to my friends and family so I wouldn't have to deal with a lot of hostess hassle in my 9th month when I can barely stand up, let alone entertain a house full of people because I am so busy USING MY BODY TO MAKE A WHOLE OTHER PERSON. The next time my child will be celebrated will be at their future birthday/Christmas/college graduation. I'll make sure and let you know the details of that gathering once they are finalized. Cheers! *Whole line of passive aggressive emojis*\u201d\n\n\nPotentially unrelated, but worth mentioning depending on the beliefs of your social circle... in 2023 many of us find gender reveal parties to be incredibly tacky and do not go to them on principle. Personally I will never recover a friendship with a friend whose husband reacted to a pink cupcake by kicking over his grill and spiking the cupcake into his yard while screaming \"REALLY?!? What the FUCK!!!\". She stayed with him, he's the exact \"boys do sports, girls do chores\" asshole we all saw in that moment, and basically she now has three daughters, the worst husband on earth, and no friends. Which is to say nothing of the fact that gender is a social construct and a child born with one set of junk might very well decide it doesn't match their gender. Gender reveal parties have a heavy undertone of \"You'll be a girl/boy whether you like it or not!\" which many people find to be a depressing burden to put on a creature that hasn't drawn breath.\n\n\nHOWEVER: I find it unlikely that every single person in your support network is blocking gender reveal parties and not a single one said anything about their potential reasons for doing so. Sounds like your friends and family just don't make you a priority, which sucks.", "You just say because the last time I tried to celebrate my baby you didn\u2019t show up. \n\nCongratulations!", "Then all of those people telling you to have one, should throw one for you.   \n\nYou certainly are not obligated to do anything you don't want to.\n\nNTA", "If anyone says to you that you should do one, I would just respond with \u201cyah it would be so nice if someone threw me one\u2026 oh well \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u201d", "Every person who pushes this should be asked when THEY are planning on hosting it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYou don't have to hold any event if you don't want to. But it could be that no one came to the gender reveal not because they don't care about you or your kid in general, but because many people view gender reveals as tacky and wasteful. A regular shower is viewed differently.", "Oh that's so sad. Sorry that happened to you. Honestly that would have made me not want the whole baby shower thing more", "Did they know you were pregnant and inviting them to a gender reveal beforehand? Or was the purpose of the party a surprise?", "[deleted]", "Not to mention newborn babies need to be protected from random people's germs.", "I had also just bought my house. Didn't think a brief mention of a gender warranted a full explanation.\n\nBasically, I told everyone it was a gathering at my new house, that we wanted everyone to come see the new place and have lunch with us and we had planned to basically surprise everyone by telling them we were pregnant and then finding out the gender. We were providing lunch and I didn't want it to be a huge thing", "I\u2019m from the UK and see that baby showers are now a thing in the UK too. I had my children over 50years ago. We had the baby, people bought gifts up to the birth, including cots etc., from grandparents, many hand knitted or crocheted items. After the birth people came to see the baby brought more gifts, sometimes, and that was that. If no-one bought a gift no-one thought anything of it. I do not understand the current obsession with gender reveals, baby showers, etc., and in the case of weddings, all the celebrations of various kinds leading up to really expensive, sometimes pointless weddings which don\u2019t last. I got married 58 years ago after being with my husband three months, (baby born 10 mtgs later so no shotgun wedding!) got married in a register office and back at his mum\u2019s for some food and a drink with friends and family. Being married was the most important thing to us, the rest is just hogwash. The most important thing in life are the people you care about, and who care about you. Spectacle is meaningless.", "Just say it\u2019s not necessary I already have everything I need for the baby. Let it go at that.", "NTA\n\nI am 41 years old, have had one child myself, am the aunt or aunt-in-law to five more children, have many friends with children, and I have never been any part of a gender reveal (nobody I know does this) or a shower (one person imported this American custom, but I wasn't in the country at the time) and all of these children were celebrated a lot after they were born by people who love them a lot and were overjoyed by their birth.\n\nWhoever is telling you that you need to host a shower for yourself is ridiculous.\n\nOff-topic, but I personally dislike that this particular American custom is spreading in Ireland. We're a nation of pessimists who don't count our chickens before they're hatched, much less celebrate a child before it's born, and throwing a party whose entire premise is to collect gifts is not good manners. The proper way to collect the stuff you need for your baby is to a) wait to have the baby until you have a job and can pay for it b) don't get more stuff than you absolutely need unless you really can afford it, and newborns don't need much and c) as much as possible, take advantage of handmedowns, which you then hand down afterwards. Getting all brand new stuff, most of it plastic, for every baby is a celebration of consumerism and disregard for the future of this planet, both of which are terrible themes for celebrating a new life who will have to live on this planet after we're all gone.", "You need better friends!!!! That's awful,I would feel so bad!!!! You've got this far by yourself do what you want!!!", "NTA.   If you don\u2019t want one, don\u2019t have one.  I\u2019m not a big fan of any \u2018societal norms\u2019 so I tend to shy away from any of these events.  Sounds like you\u2019re also struggling with hurt and disappointment and that\u2019s ok.  Why would you want to go through that effort to entertain a bunch of women that didn\u2019t have your back before?", "NTA. Who are those people? Do you like them? Do you want to party with them? Do you want to party with them, when the baby is born and you are totally tired and stressed? \n\nIf you would answer any of this questions with no, than you don't need to have a party.", "NTA\n\nI'm from the Netherlands and babyshowers are not really a thing here. I know some people who had them, but just as many who didn't. You do you and do what feels good for you and baby.\n\nTraditionally here people bring a small gift when they come to see the baby (kraambezoek) for the first time. A little book, a toy or a piece of clothing that's in the half year size category (generally people are smart enough not to buy the smallest size, since they assume you already bought plenty of that size yourself). To me that's so much nicer than a big party where you have to spend energy at while already being exhausted from pregnancy.", "Meh... Just respond by saying \"all I need is diapers\" . Then if these people want to give a gift at least they know what to get. We don't need to live our life to gain other people's approval.\n\nTBH the gender reveal party was a bad idea.

Sending you love and internet hugs for baby #2.\n\nETA after reading a few comments: it\u2019s common in my area for there to be a shower for each pregnancy. A family member had 5 babies over 4 pregnancies, the last 3 of which were back to back, her mom and I put together a shower for each, little painful for that favor to not be returned \ud83e\udee0", "I dunno, I kind of feel that being upset over people not showing up for a new home reveal when it was to be for a surprise pregnancy reveal is pretty unfair.  I know I don't really have strong expectations about showing up at someone's new home.  I wasn't even aware that it is still a thing.  For that I would say YTA.   And like you said, this will be your second child, when baby showers aren't normally held.", "OP buried key details about the gender reveal though\u2014in later comments, she\u2019s explaining that she didn\u2019t tell anyone it was a gender reveal, or in any way pregnancy-related, she just hosted a housewarming where she planned to do a pregnancy/gender reveal. It\u2019s very possible that the friends encouraging her to have a shower either don\u2019t know that they missed the event or know that and feel guilty, which is why they\u2019re encouraging another party. \n\nNone of that means OP should have to throw her own party if she doesn\u2019t want to, but I think it changes the read on her friends\u2019 behavior a little bit that they didn\u2019t intentionally skip out on an earlier baby celebration.", "I'm also in the UK and my kids are teens now. I never had a baby shower. Some people gave gifts if they wanted to but it certainly wasn't expected and tbh most of the gifts were bags of second hand babygrows and toys that people's kids had grown out of rather than new stuff.", "It's that last one I feel like everyone around me is skipping . No regard for how I feel at all. No I don't want to host a party almost 8 months pregnant and I don't want to host a party a few weeks post partum either.

Just because they didn\u2019t bother to show doesn\u2019t mean the baby wasn\u2019t celebrated. ETA NTA", "A shower is not to celebrate a baby, it's purpose is to to set you up with items you need. That's been done already by the people who gifted you the money. \n\nWhoever is telling you to throw yourself a shower is wrong. The appropriate answer to that person is \"if you're offering to host a gathering so people  can celebrate and meet the baby after it arrives, thanks I accept! Please give me about a month to recover from childbirth, and we'll get cleaned up, dressed up, and come over to your place for the party.\"", "If these people are so concerned THEY should host one for you. \ud83d\ude44 NTA", "NTA Ask them why they didn\u2019t show up to celebrate your baby\u2019s gender reveal if that\u2019s the case.", "\u201cAhhh I did, the gender reveal? That you didn\u2019t turn up to?\u201d Nta", "\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t come to the last thing that I planned for the baby. Why would I think you\u2019d come to the next?\u201d\n\nThrow it in their faces. Call them out.", "If they feel that way, then let them throw the freaking shower like they should be doing.\n\nA big NTA.  It sounds like you have terrible people in your life.  I'm so sorry.", "They think the baby's going to be offended?", "Be honest with these people and tell them the truth \"I planned my gender reveal and no one showed up so why am I going to spend money on another party when no one shows up'.", "Ohoho, I love that idea. Yes please, OP, do it so", "But, if that was the case, the friends should host the party as a way to apologize, not press OP to do it again. (I know is what we would do in my group of friends if that happened)\n\nAnd no one showed up? I doesnt matter if it is a gender reveal or just a normal dinner with friends. I'm sure OP didnt tell them it was a gender reveal to avoid that they buy things.", "Thanks! We are definitely excited for sure for this new adventure", "Ahh .. I understand... that would be heartbreaking. I'm really sorry your friends behaved like that. Good friends are really hard to find. I hope you enjoy your pregnancy to its fullest, and your little baby will bring you so much joy you'll forget about those morons lol. And you'll be too tired to care. Lol Good luck", "I find gender reveals tacky as hell too but if my best friend is having one then I\u2019m going to show up for my best friend. Sometimes it\u2019s not just about our opinions and it\u2019s about being there for support.", "My circle is mostly warm or neutral towards gender reveals but it was also a surprise, basically wrapped in a kinda housewarming event. I had invited everyone over on the pretext of seeing our new home and having lunch with us to celebrate and then planned to announce the new baby and sex once everyone arrived. \n\nAnd basically that last sentence hit the nail on the head. I'm the last told anything, if I am told at all. I'm rarely invited to anything. I'm kinda the unwilling black sheep. I want my family involved but they are all too busy for me", "I agree with everything you said and I really love your username.", ">\"I planned my gender reveal and no one showed up\n\nThis is the crux of the issue they're trying to push. They're most likely feeling guilty for not showing up to one party so now they're pushing OP to plan another to \"make it up\" to OP, AKA trying to ease their own guilt.\n\nIf they really felt that guilty, then they would plan together to throw OP a party to make up for being no shows to OPs last one.", "It was a surprise. I had also recently purchased a new house so I invited everyone over on the pretext of seeing the new house and having lunch with us. Kind of like a house warming party I suppose but I didn't want gifts and made that clear. I just wanted the people in my life to come over and have food with us and then I was going to tell everyone at the same time that I was pregnant and then also share the sex since we also had the test results", "Sometimes the supportive thing is to tell your friend that they're doing something pretty cringe, and they're a lot more likely to have a decent turnout if they don't start off by alienating people with the very premise of their event. I also don't attend weddings on former slave plantations. Do you want to just wink at the terrible subtext or are you gonna actually be the person who tells their friends not to do anything that could result in a gallows platform, whipping post or shackles anchors being in their wedding photos?\n\n\nBelieve it or not, it's incredibly likely that even if the kid isn't LGBTQ identified, they're gonna look back on a gender reveal party as a super gross and presumptuous thing they never would have wanted. Sometimes a good friend tells you not to wear mocking drag or blackface to your frat party.\n\n\nYes, the world is full of horrible people who had everyone prioritize their personal thoughts and desires from day 1 and all the folks surrounding them who accommodate that view. We call them assholes. This chick sounds like she is genuinely baffled by the simultaneous demands and lack of support from her social networks. So if she unknowingly invited her entire local musical theatre friend group to a gender reveal party without being aware of the unfortunate subtext, this is one possible explanation why people would want to celebrate her baby but not attend her previous party.", "Also but why would people feel there needs to be a shower for them to give a gift. If they want to help out, then just send a gift or drop off diapers or whatever. They don't need to impose on new mum's hospitality unnecessarily just to send a gift to celebrate new baby.", "I would put this in the post, tbh. I think it changes the tone of your friends\u2019 comments a lot that they didn\u2019t knowingly skip out on your first pregnancy celebration. Do they know what they missed? Is it possible they\u2019re encouraging you to have a party because they feel guilty they missed the surprise party? Either way, you don\u2019t need to host a party you don\u2019t want to host, but I wouldn\u2019t read your friends missing your housewarming as disinterest in your future child. We have a young baby at home and social events are tough to get to sometimes\u2014I\u2019d very much skip a housewarming on a busy day (because those are fairly casual in my social circle) when I wouldn\u2019t miss a baby-related event. I get that the surprise seems like a fun idea, but it does risk people missing out because they don\u2019t know the significance of the event. \n\nBest of luck with the rest of your pregnancy & I hope you have plenty of opportunities to celebrate however you prefer with the important people in your life!"]}
