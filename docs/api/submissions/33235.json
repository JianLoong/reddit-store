My husband was getting on my case lately about buying too many peppermint mocha lattes from Starbucks. For two days before my birthday, he is hyping up this gift he will give me first thing in the morning. So he surprised me with a homemade peppermint mocha latte that he made. \n\nThe twist is he made it with essential oils that some random lady at a health food sure assured him is okay. I have a panic attack after he tells me he fed me essential oils. I felt enraged and hated when I look on the essential oil bottle and it clearly states it is for use in a humidifier. He didn't even read the bottle before deciding to make me this \"sweet gesture\" with it. I have never been interested in essential oils so he has no reason to think I'd want to ingest this. \n\nHe says he isn't the ahole because how could he know a shopkeeper would lie... AITA for blowing up and telling him Im so disappointed?\n\nUpdate: Poison control said I'll be fine and it's probably the panic attack that effed my stomach up. He bought the food safe peppermint so he can redo the drink safely now. Husband understands I'm not an essential oil gal and won't be giving me anymore ever.

As in, not sick? I can't even process the idea of thinking an essential oil is the way to flavour coffee.

I expected you to say a fancy coffee maker or something to diy your coffees. Not one poisoned drink. \n\nI'm sorry it ruined your birthday.

Technically essential oils aren't even safe for use on top of the skin. I think it's worth calling poison control or following up with a doctor. Essential oils are different than flavors used for foods and ingestion. I would be livid.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t mess with people\u2019s food (or drinks).

I want to think \u201che meant well\u201d (the Yankee version of \u201cbless his heart\u201d), as I\u2019m thinking he has more of an issue with the cost of your coffee drinks- though I\u2019m sure the ingredients for his bootleg version were hella expensive, the money better spent on a gift card for you. \n\nGet him a humidifier for Christmas so he can PROPERLY make use of that expensive peppermint essential oil.", "NTA. That is the most passive aggressive gift. Girl, get your butt to Starbucks every damn day if you want.", "NTA. A tiny bit of research could tell you it wasn't safe to ingest essential oils. I'm also addicted to peppermint white mochas, so I understand the obsession.\n\nThat said, here's how to make peppermint syrup: bring 1 cup water and 1 cup sugar to a boil. Take off heat and let cool ten minutes. Mix in 1 teaspoon peppermint EXTRACT. Store in fridge for up to one month. \n\nThe extract is usually pretty cheap.

I made a cheaper at-home version so you\u2019ll stop spending money on something I deem unimportant.\u201d Like wouldn\u2019t a nice gift be\u2026 getting you a gift card so you can treat yourself without guilt in the future?\n\nEdited to add: NTA", "So he bashed on the Starbucks to make it an issue, then fed you posion because he didn't bother to read the bottle.

This is a tough one because I don't want to call your husband an asshole for being mentally challenged, but god damn you should be checking what you're using to feed people. \n\nThis is bordering on NAH here though; it's obvious husband is a bit dim and must be completely unaware of the whole essential oil/ healing hippie health store thing, and while I'm not blaming you, you should probably be more careful in accepting anything from  a man who's this dumb", "Am I reading this right???

So he surprised me with a homemade peppermint mocha latte that he made. \n\nThe twist is he made it with essential oils that some random lady at a health food sure assured him is okay. I have a panic attack after he tells me he fed me essential oils. I felt enraged and hated when I look on the essential oil bottle and it clearly states it is for use in a humidifier. He didn't even read the bottle before deciding to make me this \"sweet gesture\" with it. I have never been interested in essential oils so he has no reason to think I'd want to ingest this. \n\nHe says he isn't the ahole because how could he know a shopkeeper would lie...

People die from ingesting EOs without proper holistic training (and a sales clerk at Whole Foods doesn't have that training, nor does the momfluincer hawking doterra on FB). \n\nAnd it's no wonder you had painful gastric issues after consuming it - food grade peppermint oil can be used as a laxative, under the care of a holistic medical practitioner who has decades of education and practical experience (again, a sales person at a store typically does not have this particular education and experience).\n\nHe got upset you found a seasonal drink you like and tried to poison/unalive you for doing something for yourself.

Would you handwave that away as him being naive and swindled? \n\n>And your trust in a label is misguided.  As someone who has worked in that field, you are assuming too much of that label.\n\nI'm still not going to risk eating something if the label says it's not safe to ingest.", "Why because I call people on their deplorable behaviour?", "I mean all evidence says you're wrong but I see you're beyond facts. Please never poison someone yourself. Have the day you deserve.", "Maybe. My inclanation is that its his mistake and he should own it. I'd insist on being there for the conversation, personally.", "there isn't a massive difference in the process. peppermint oil is made from the leaves, like essential oils. don't get me wrong I would choose to drink it, but it shouldn't be causing any issues.", "peppermint would be on the appropriate amounts list. it is unlikely to be as good as making it with proper peppermint oil but it also shouldn't cause issues after taking it twice.", "Peppermint extract, which is what is used to flavor things like coffee drinks, is not the same thing as peppermint oil.", "Yes, but peppermint extract is diluted peppermint oil.  \n\nIt is true that peppermint oil is generally safe for human consumption within certain consumption parameters, there seems to have been no regard for those parameters when making the coffee\n\nBut the bigger problem is that this product was labelled for humidifier use; that means it wasn't handled, processed, or packaged in a way intended to be eaten.  So it should most certainly not be eaten.", "Essential oils are not regulated. They are not food safe.", "Op said to use for humidifiers on the bottle. Safe to say it wasn\u2019t for ingestion", "Yeah, some essential oils are a *very* bad ideas for humans/pets to ingest, and while peppermint essential oil isn't the same as peppermint candy flavoring, it's not one that's poisonous.\n\nI call it a pretty radical stretch from \"my husband did a dumbass thing out of love because he and a random sales lady aren't certified herbalists or baristas\" to \"I feel HATED\" and all of reddit freaking out like he fed OP a hemlock latte.\n\nI get you wigging out a bit, OP, but soft YTA for the extreme reaction to a thing done out of love.", "Look it up, you are only supposed to use a few drops of the peppermint oil per liter or gallon water. It's diluted that way, it's not like you are using a whole bottle of it.", "No beacuse you instantly jump to everyone must be intentionally malicious in the worst way possible and clearly project your own trauma onto others.", "HIGH DOSE amounts, okay. And? OP says she experienced a little discomfort. Again I say BOOOO HOOOO. If his intention was to poison and kill her, then I'd say she indeed did not over react. But that wasn't his intent, So yes, I say BOOOO HOOOO. And I'll add Cry Me a River, just for you.", "I can see that point, but if OP has to supervise his call to his sister to make sure she has all the relevant information, it's probably safer for OP to just tell her. Plus, if the husband argues and tries to get out of it, that could waste a lot of time.", "If OP has to supervise his calls they shouldn't be together. \n\nEither she thinks he did it intentionally and thus the trust is broken and she should do it herself and then break up with him or she believes it was a stupid accident and while he needs to own his mistake and correct it, nothing happened to indicate he's a liar or can't be trusted. \n\nIf every time I made a mistake, my partner had to behave like a parent and watch me apologize it would destroy the trust. I'd feel like my partner thought of me as a child. No thank you.", "Essential oils are distilled to achieve a particular strength of concentration (x1, x5, x10, etc) necessary for whatever it's intended end use will be (in this case, a humidifier), while food grade oils are distilled to concentration that's proven safe for human consumption by a food lab. The two are not interchangable, no matter what the MLM lady says. Lol", "The bottle said it\u2019s not for consumption.", "Peppermint oil is also used to flavor things, especially things like hard candies where the alcohol/water versions interfere with setting.\n\nI used peppermint essential oil to make hard candies for Christmas last week.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Whole-Foods-Market-Essential-Peppermint/dp/B074Y7Z8KR/\n\nBut it does need to be food grade, not \"therapeutic\" grade or whatever bullshit.", "Some are food safe, but they're explicitly labeled as such.\n\ne.g. https://www.amazon.com/Whole-Foods-Market-Essential-Peppermint/dp/B074Y7Z8KR/", "Not regulated by whom? And for what purpose?\n\nIn the UK for example oils are regulated if used for aromatherapy, they are regulated in that they are not allowed  to make unproven medical claims. They are accepted as a food additive (if they're actually an edible oil -eg mint, and not poisonous...) but aren't classed as an edible oil, which we regulate differently (edible oils are things like olive oil, sunflower oil etc).", "I don't know, if my partner gave me *a* coffee for my birthday because he thinks I spend too much money buying ones I like, I wouldn't really feel \"loved\".\n\nThis is pretty obviously a \"see, we can make it from home for cheaper, so stop wasting money\" *gift*.", "lol! You make me laugh so hard. If you read through the persons posts.. there\u2019s clearly a pattern of behaviour. Everyone else is wrong and they aren\u2019t. The way the OP posted about her husband makes me disgusted. It was an honest mistake and she\u2019s accusing him of poisoning her. He did something out of love and care\u2026. There\u2019s nothing to point to it being malicious.", "the sister's health could be at risk", "you are thinking of homeopathy. pure essential oils are just the oil in question,", "yeah I can believe that. doesn't mean it has caused the issue. \n\nall essential oil bottles will have exactly the same warning. chances are OP has stomach ache as a result of expecting to have stomach ache.", "op was quite clear it was not an edible oil", "Yeh, if they framed it that way, it's not great.", "I mean a Google search isn't difficult and in this day and age having media literacy is an important skill. Just cause a salesman tells me this special bleach is safe to consume doesn't mean I'm just going to do it or even buy it then there. I'll look it up first. That's the real issue here.", "I agree. Which is why he needs to own his mistake and make it right by telling his sister.\n\nI am not arguing against that. I am saying that you should be able to trust your partner to do these things without watching them. If you don't trust them enough to do what they say they will do, then the relationship has other issues.  \n\nHer story includes him being an idiot and making a mistake. He's an asshole because he's blowing off how dangerous it is, but nothing in the story or replies I have seen indicates he can't be trusted or was a liar.", "There are many things that can make a product \u201cnot food grade\u201d, from the machinery used to extract the oil, the bottle the oil is stored in and the cleanliness of the manufacturing facility. \n\nFood products have extremely strict protocols that need to be followed, and this definitely could have ended much worse if a batch of this oil had been accidentally contaminated.", "You\u2019re fine consuming essential oils, doesn\u2019t mean everyone else should be and you probably shouldn\u2019t be advocating for an essential oil when you haven\u2019t seen the labels, the brand, the ingredients and the warning labels.", "bro, are you the husband? learn when to fucking sit down and stop talking.", "She may not be correct though. If it was bought from a reasonable company there is nothing stopping it from being safe to eat.\n\nI'm suspicious that she's misidentified it. (Based anecdotally on me cooking a lot and having used peppermint, orange and lemon oils a lot.)\n\nOh, I'm also suspicious because concentrated peppermint dropped into coffee would be oily dots floating on top with a horrific flavour. There's no way she'd have drunk it.", "Not everyone thinks the same way you do. \nDo you go to Home Depot and ask the guy in the electrical section what you need for said project and then go home and google it? Better yet do you second guess an electrician who comes to your house to fix it? \nHighly unlikely. They are the expert."]}
