She is lashing out and accusing mum of not loving her as an ongoing test of your mother's love. Also probably some punishment in there too. The problem is it is very unhealthy to do that and eventually people will give up. At a certain point, you need to either forgive and focus on how to rebuild the relationship or you walk away entirely. Instead of erasing the tattoo, your mum should have laid down a boundary.   She should have acknowledged she screwed up and that hurt sister badly. She loves sister and always will but she will not apologise or accept abuse from your sister anymore. Mum is happy to go to therapy with sister or discuss how they can rebuild their relationship  or go no contact. The ball is in sisters court and she loves sister enough to respect her wishes. But mum will no longer be sister's verbal punching bag and will leave the conversation if sister behaves like that. And then enforce that boundary.\n\nOP - you mean well but you cannot fix this. It is between your mum and your sister.  Your mum would probably benefit from therapy on how best to communicate, deal with your sister and forgive herself.

OP is 10 years younger than the sister.  Mom got the tatton when the sister was born.  OP never said sister started telling mom to have it removed because of the affair.  For all we know the sister could have been saying it during the 10 years before OP was born.", "Anime pfp \u2705\ufe0f\nPlays Genshin \u2705\ufe0f\nOpinion Irrelevant \u2705\ufe0f", "Found another Incel idiot", "Oh look, I found an incel", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Who knows what that relationship was like? I'm not trying to excuse the cheating, but let's not automatically assume the ex was some innocent, blameless victim. Cheating after 10+ years of marriage? The relationship had issues, and those usually come from both sides.", "that is also true , however the post even states that the sister & mother relationship has been damaged since the affair , so it is safe to assume the tattoo does not help that matter", "The cheating and subsequent break up affects the kids, therefore I have to agree with the perspective that cheating is a betrayal of the whole family and not just your partner. You are very aware of the fact that giving into your selfish desires would have negative consequences for your children when you cheat, you cannot then argue that they have no right to have feelings about you making their life worse.", "Sounds like you're excusing the mother's cheating based on nothing but your own personal values and speculation on what may or may not have happened. If it was a man cheating on a woman would you say the same?
