My sister always told my mother that she should erase the tattoo, since she didn't want her name craved on my mother's arm. My mom always refused and said that she still loved it, and it was her decision to keep it.\n\nA few months ago tho, I found my mom crying in her room and rubbing some exfoliating cream on her arm, and when I asked what she was doing she said that she wanted to erase the tattoo. (Apparently my sister said something about it again on my cousin's house, but I wasn't present to know what) I told her that if she was uncomfortable with it, I could pay for a laser removal for her.

She didn't say anything to us, but she and her husband excused themselves and went home. A few of our family members asked why my mom removed the tattoo and she couldn't answer. I got really angry and said that I was the one that picked the clinic and if they wanted to be mad at someone, than it would be me. Some people called me an asshole and said that I should have told my mom to not do this, but as much as I understand my sister's rage, I can't justify her being mad now of something she told my mom to do a dozen times before.

She got what she asked for!!it\u2019s no one else\u2019s business. You did no wrong. Whether you took mom there or not. And your mom did no wrong either. It\u2019s not easy being a parent.

Your relatives are though.\n\nOther than having her mixed feelings in this situation, your sister didn't do anything wrong in this situation either. Emotions are odd and messy, and given the trauma y'all's  mother possibly inflicted on your sister through her infidelity- it's fair for her emotions regarding this to be complex. She may be \"mad\", or just sad that it had to come to this at all. Maybe decades of repressed feelings regarding their deteriorated relationship came out at once... we don't know. As long as she doesn't make any more demands or comments about this, and just deals with her feelings herself- your sister will also remain NTA. Both your and your sister's actions in this situation are understandable and valid. \n\nYour relatives are the AH though. This is not their relationship or issue to meddle in. Point your anger at them ig.\n\nETA: In the larger context, yes- mom was the AH for cheating and inflicting trauma on her daughter/family. And sister was the AH for constantly having bad exchanges with her mom, not either making peace with what happened/the tattoo or going low/no contact as an adult.

I suppose except for your mother for cheating and for the relatives for gossiping . \nSister is entitled to her feelings after something like that , perhaps the tattoo was the last remanence of her relationship with mother in her eyes .

That's her mother who cheated on her father and you don't mention any attempt at rebuilding a relationship after her family was torn apart by these actions (in her eyes).\n\n**Why your mom is TA:** Your mom is acting like her sister, not her mother, I'm sorry. She needs to grow up and take some responsibility for the fall out with her daughter and how it's effected you and your sister's relationship. While your sister should separate the affair from you, I can see where she is having trouble - you're a reminder of the infidelity and likely a lot of anger her father has shared with her about the situation/betrayal. So dramatic to be in the bathroom crying while exfoliating...get it removed (which she did, fair) or just deal with it.\n\n**Why your sister is TA:** Your sister either needs to stop showing up at these functions or stop talking to your mom at them - it's not like you all live together or need to speak. You can be in the same space and not talk, so she's doing a lot. She's also saying this crap to hurt your mom because she feels hurt - she cried because she absolutely didn't want your mom to remove the last remnant that she still cared. It was a tattoo that your mom got when she was born - it means something. She needs to process these feelings, but I'm going with less TA than mom here because ultimately, your mom is your mom. It hurts when you feel rejected by a parent. She still needs to grow up, but this is something she's been holding since she was 10 years old.\n\nYou're N T A, you just saw your mom hurting and suggested exactly what your sister was saying to do. You're a bystander/witness here - frankly, I don't even think this is your AITA post to make. You might be TA for getting involved in that last spat, but it's justified, I guess. Your mom and sister need THERAPY. They seem to still love each other but your mom clearly doesn't have to tools to bridge this and your sister feels way too hurt and betrayed to extend the olive branch.\n\nThey need to buck up or let each other go. This is an emotionally painful situation, but it's been 25 yrs.", "NTA Your \"sister\" is a PITA", "ESH\n\n\nYour mother caused this entire drama by cheating\n\n\nYour sister understandably doesn't want her name on her disgraceful mother but also doesn't want to be literally erased and has given mixed messages\n\nYou've encouraging your mothers actions I'm erasing your sister.

What are the chances you could all sit down at a restaurant together and come up with a tattoo that represents the three of you that you can all get together?
