I\u2019m the older sibling, clocking in at 25, and my sister\u2019s 20. Our family dynamic has always been... well, complicated.\n\nMy parents have been together for a long time, and they always wanted a daughter, even before I was born. When I came along, they were a bit bummed but not too disappointed. They kept trying for another child and faced some conception troubles, even seeking help from a clinic.\n\nEventually, they succeeded and were overjoyed when they found out it was a girl. They told me to be a good role model and keep her safe, which made me happy as a 5-year-old.\n\nHowever, things changed after my sister was born. My relationship with my parents shifted dramatically. I felt sidelined, almost like I didn't matter anymore. I didn't get birthday celebrations, gifts, or a close connection with my parents. They said they had to focus on my younger sister because she was little, and I needed to understand that.\n\nGrowing up, my parents treated my sister and me totally differently. They made me get a job at 14 to help with bills and rent, while my sister didn't have to. I never got the same treatment as her - she got new stuff, and I had to work for everything with my part-time job, even though I had to give half of my earnings to my parents. My sister was the favorite, and we never got along well.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I worked hard and got into medical school. But my parents said they couldn't afford to help me out, which really annoyed me. I decided to go anyway and worked my butt off to pay for everything. Despite the challenges, I finished my degree and started my residency.\n\nMy sister just finished high school and got into this pricey private college, living on her own with our parents' full support. I've kinda made peace with their favoritism, keeping my distance since I barely see them - living in a different city and all. So, when I visited recently, my sister shocked me by suggesting we go to therapy together. I thought it might help us patch things up, but the therapist ended up blaming me for all my sister's issues, saying I needed to step back for her mental health. I got seriously pissed, confronted the therapist, and, of course, my sister and parents took her side, leaving me fuming.\n\nSince I believe what the therapist did was unethical, I filed a complaint against the her, thinking it was the right thing to do. Turns out, it's not as anonymous as I thought, and now my parents are begging me to withdraw it, claiming it'll hurt the person who was apparently \"helping their princess.\" I had enough and hightailed it out of there, driving six hours back to my place, still seething and feeling like I could've handled the whole mess better.\n\nNow, I can't say I'm not feeling like shit. I hate this situation, and while I don't feel like all I did was undeserving, maybe I should have handled it differently. So, Reddit, AITA?\n\nNote: I'm not on the US or Europe.", "created_utc": 1696011251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vixv2/aita_for_reporting_my_sisters_therapist/", "score": 1437, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe write her a long letter saying how it\u2019s been for you growing up, the favouritism etc and that\u2019s the reason you keep distance.

You filed the complaint, it's not up to you what the outcome is.   \n\nCan you go no contact with your family?   Is there anything left to salvage?\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. I think this is a bad take by the therapist, but I don't think it would rise to the level of something so unethical she'd face serious consequences for her license. But that doesn't mean it's a bad thing to report her, you don't know exactly where the line is and the licensing board or whoever can make a further determination.", "NTA I feel like your parents probably bribed the therapist to blame you for everything so you would feel guilty and to pay for the pricey private school she wants to go to. Go no contact with these cretins and live your best life.", "YTA.  So basically, the therapist told you things that your sister didn't have the courage to tell you, and you got pissed and reported the therapist? That about sum it up?", "Part of this depends on the ethical code of conduct for professional therapists in the country/region/province/state you're in. You note you're not in the US or Europe so most of us on Reddit don't have a frame of reference. \n\nAlso, was your sister already in therapy and asked you join a session so that you could be part of the process/to facilitate a conversation? Or did you both agree to do joint therapy and find this therapist together. In the US at least, there are different professional/ethical expectations if two people are in a therapy session together and both are considered clients/patients (like couples counseling) or one person is the client and a person from their life joins a session to help with their progress. In the second scenario, therapists have different responsibilities to their client vs. an additional party in the session and your complaint to their licensing body would be out of line. At least that's how it works where I live. \n\nYou don't go into much detail, but if you joined your sister's therapy session where you having this conversation within a safe space for her to share that she needed to step back from your relationship a bit and the therapist was there to help her say her piece and have support if she had anxiety or other issues? You sound angry and hurt about this so perhaps we're getting your view as a narrator and your sister and her (our your joint?) therapist would have a different telling. If, for example, your sister has begun to realize she's the golden child she may be sorting out how to reconceptualize her entire childhood and family relationships. Golden children are harmed growing up in an unhealthy household as well as the scapegoated kids, just in a different way. Maybe she's having anxiety and guilt about this realization and needs space to process it and is asking you for that space. Or, maybe you treat her with anger and disgust (but don't seem aware of it) because of the way your parents pitted you against one another and she doesn't have the coping skills to deal with that yet?\n\nThis is all supposition, but by your own admission you got seriously pissed during the session, so perhaps you didn't catch the nuance of the situation. There are clearly some details missing.", "Exactly. And it\u2019s obvious that he did nothing wrong here (parents, therapist, and yes, his sister are the AHs here) I think there\u2019s no better way he could\u2019ve handled this situation. He reported the unprofessional therapist, and didn\u2019t stick around to listen to his parents\u2019 verbal abuse.", "Agreed.  One report shouldn't matter especially if the board doesn't see it as a big deal.", "Yeah, things are a bit strange in my country. They don't really give you the option of being anonymous, but I didn't expect the complaint to carry my name if they ever informed her.\n\nI agree with you that this is completely absurd. But I can't do much about it now.", "Sure. She claims she compares herself too much with me, which affects her mental health greatly. Giving her anxiety, among other problems.", "I think you mean coddle, paying someone to cuddle her would be a different line of work", "PS Contrats on your achievements!!!", "Essentially, they invited me there to corner me and essentially just blame me for... well, for existing. Both of them were.\n\nI don't think that's the job of a therapist, so I wrote a detailed report of what transpired. I essentially reported them for misconduct of behavior (not sure if this is the proper English term.)\n\nSorry for being vague.", "I agree. I don\u2019t see any ethical violation here. Anyone can report anyone for anything but I doubt the therapist will get into any trouble.", "Since there's a limit on characters on the post. I had to try to keep it short. Sorry about that.\n\nMy sister and I never got along. She was the princess and knew it. She tormented me, blamed me for everything, and made sure to abuse her favour.\n\nShe goes to the therapist to treat her mental health. She claims she compares herself too much with me, and a few other things.\n\nAgain, sorry for being vague.", "After reading through all the comments, I ask you a question about your sister.\n\nI know she was barely a teenager when you left. \n\nWould you consider your sister a narcissist?  or perhaps very manipulative?\n\n I ask because the way you describe being blindsided, and then attacked doesn't sit right with me.  It is as if you sister had this planned from the beginning.", "Wow. And what were you expected to do? Fail at your own goals so that she can feel superior? \n\nThis still seems so weird. I don't know why a professional would take that position. Normally, one would expect them to work on her feelings of inadequacy by building up her own self-image, not scapegoat a relative.  \n\nDo you taunt her or constantly flaunt your success? Do you project resentment over your parent's favoritism? I'm just wondering if there was specific guidance that the counselor offered. What did she mean by \"step back\"?", "No worries pal, this gave me a better idea. NTA then. My younger brother is like that, the golden child who still rants because, despite his vexations, I got to earn more than him. Probably, the therapist got played. I wouldn't have reported her though.", "Wait - so what were you supposed to do to make her feel better? Stop being successful?", "That's exactly what i thought because it doesn't make sense to me otherwise. She definitely planned this whole thing beforehand.\nclearly OP's NTA", "Absolutely not. I would never taunt someone, especially my sister. Look, I do resent her, but not to the point of causing her distress.\n\nI still don't know what she meant by taking a step back. As mentioned, I barely see my sister ever since I left home.", "NTA  \n\nYou have no idea what your sister has told the therapist. In her version of events you may be an ever present force constantly undermining your sister.\n\nYou were set up by your sister as the scapegoat for whatever problems or failures she is refusing to address. \n\nThe therapist needs reporting and extensive supervision at the very least. They overstepped the professional boundaries. You're training to be a Doctor you need to protect future patients from the massive amount of harm this therapist could cause if left unchecked.", "NTA \n\nBut it sounds like a 'garbage in, garbage out' situation. \n\nThe therapist may be awful. \n\nBut she likely has been told many alternative facts by your sister, facts supported and affirmed by both your parents, and has reached a reality-adjacent conclusion based on them. \n\nI am so sorry your family of birth is treating you this way. You deserve better. I am delighted you are succeeding so well at creating that better reality for yourself.", "Both you and your sister had shitty parents growing up.\n\nAlthough your parents intention was to give her everything in the world, it's possible they infantilized her. \n\nThe fact that your sister is in therapy because she doesn't feel good enough in comparison to you shows the way your parents behaved towards *both* of you has had a negative outcome on *both* of you.\n\nThis is not your fault. It's not your sister's fault. It is your parents fault.\n\nIt is not your responsibility to fix, but you and your sister having an understanding of how your parents behaviour has affected each of you might help you both. You could write her a letter explaining your childhood to her, but you have no obligation to do so.\n\nETA: the therapist isn't helping your parents \"princess\", as they are barking up the wrong tree completely.\n\nNTA", "Your parents backed you into a corner where you had no choice but to sink or swim and now that you're on the Olympic podium doing your residency\u2014how dare you be independent while our princess needs water wings!\n\nThis appointment was to reinforce your sister's delusion that her lack of independence and earned success is your fault when it's your parents'. It was also a sneaky way for your parents to misplace blame on you. It backfired when you wouldn't bend to them. \n\nA therapist should absolutely be able to see when parents have tanked a kid's ability to function and help everyone move forward rather than take the easy way out and displace blame. \n\nMight sound like your parents are the AH and your sister isn't, but she is for making herself the main character in your life and asking you to \"step back.\" \n\nCut them all off because they will come begging while insulting you. \n\nNTA. They are.", "NTA. I am going to guess that your parents and sister shopped around to find a \"therapist\" who supported their narrative.\n\nYour family is a mess of toxicity.  Sounds like it is time to go no contact and focus on healthy relationships and your own future.", "Here's an idea: stage your own drama of a therapy session. Get down your sister and parents and have a fake therapist say you are going through sever mental health issues and that they are the cause of it all, and they need to get the hell away from you.", "Ok, you might not like my answer here. But lightly, YTA.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nYour sister is almost assuredly a narcissist of some type. Now when she goes and sees her therapist, the therapist is expecting her to be honest. But as a narcissist, that isn\u2019t possible. Unless the Therapist has dealt with narcissists before in a therapy session, they will be conned by their patient on what is going on. Your sister is manipulating the therapist and the therapist doesn\u2019t realize it. The therapist as bought into your sisters lies, and you being the family scapegoat are to blame.\n\nNow, you can blame the therapist for not being objective, but for a fairly inexperienced one, this can pretty easily happen. It basically can happen to anyone. By making a claim against the therapist, you do them real significant harm. And for what?\n\nLet\u2019s be really honest here. A narcissist absolutely can not be helped by anyone. They will never be able to admit their real problems lie in themselves. So what does it matter if the therapist doesn\u2019t realize she is a narcissist?\n\nHere is what I would do if I were you. Ask the therapist for a one on one. Tell her you will remove the complaint in exchange. Then let her know your whole side of the story and remove the complaint. Whether she believes you or not is besides the point. You have then given her the information, if she doesn\u2019t believe you or doesn\u2019t get the significance, drop it along with the complaint. It does neither of you any good.\n\nNow for the more pressing issues. Your family seems to be a bunch of narcissists. Nothing will change that. Cut your losses. Cut them out of your life. They will never do anything good for you, but always expect you to do for them.\n\nGet yourself your own therapist and start fresh, you have a lot of damage to undo in yourself.", "NTA \n\nDo not back off, if it is causing problems then what she did was unethical, fuck her, your parents and the lil golden child.", "NTA. If the therapist did nothing wrong, nothing should happen to them. I don't know about your country, but were I live people report for the pettiest bullshit - a lot of it is just dismissed. So (and I am applying what I know Here, don't know If thats the Case where you are) If you were Reporting them wrongfully...then nothing will happen. Your parents panic proves to me that they know it was unprofessional.", "If you feel what she did was wrong, file the compliant. If the therapist did not do anything wrong, the compliant will be investigated and be closed out. \n\nEither way, not really your concern anymore. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour terrible family dragged you out of the successful life you have created *away from them* to weaponize an unethical \"expert\" against you. Why would they drag you back into their shit just to have a quack tell you that you're the entire problem and you need to go away again? Because they messed up their \"princess\" and they don't want to face it, so they had to blame you. Unfortunately they probably shopped around for a therapist who would validate that. \n\nThe therapist's behavior here is utterly galling and you absolutely should not withdraw your complaint. It's shocking that the therapist would tell your family and ask them to pressure you this way. It's *witness tampering*. \n\nI also recommend that you cease all contact with the losers who birthed you. You raised yourself and it seems you did a hell of a job.\n\n\nETA: this therapist is unequivocally NOT helping your sister. She is actively participating in the family myth that you are the cause of all principessa's problems. That is *harm* that she is doing to your sister and to you.", "There is critical missing information here. The options are literally, everyone else  is wrong / evil, or OP is misrepresenting.", "Time to go low or no contact with your family. NTA", "NTA. How are you responsible for your sister\u2019s mental issues? And what did they mean by step back, when you hardly see her?", "NTA\n\nThis therapist is feeding the lies your parents have imprinted on her as reality and is encouraging planned group attacks on you instead of getting your side. Unprofessional and unethical.", "NTA bro get tf away from these toxic ass people. These people sound life draining and emotionally destroying. You deserve better, and these disgusting people are not it. They effing emotionally abused you and made you feel unimportant and now want to make you the reason their \"precious princess\" has \"issues\". \n\nLeave these people to rot bro.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"urns out, it's not as anonymous as I thought, and now my parents are begging me to withdraw it, claiming it'll hurt the person who was apparently \"helping their princess.\"\" .. Don'T withdraw your complaint.", "NTA. It sounds like that therapist is either incompetent or sister gave a *very* skewed view of her relationship with you/your role in her life. But the therapist should have spoken to you to verify the information. Especially since it makes no sense to \"take a step back\" when you're already low contact. I don't blame you for making the report. Stick with it.", "Step back from doing what? Are you even present in her life in the first place? WTF.\n\nSounds like a crappy therapist and you were right to report. \n\nNTA. \n\nI'd go NC with all of them.  Your sisters probably stem from your parents spoiling her.", "NTA. The therapist attacked you. No one has the right to do that. I doubt very much they're actually helping your sister, and they're either a raging incompetent or telling the princess what she wants to hear to keep the money train going.", "NTA- you reporting will help prevent something like this from happening to someone else.", "NTA -Nope the therapist is feeding into her delusion which IS NOT healthy. She should be reported. She either needs to be retrained or lose her license. But heavily monitored if put back in the field. \n\nIt's not healthy for you to continue to engage with them.

OP lives six hours away. He rarely goes home or interacts with family. He has been treated as if he were invisible for years. He has no reason to believe that his family even thinks of him, so why would they want him to go to therapy? His sister knew she was the favorite and relished her position in the family. She told him in therapy that his academic success (which he worked incredibly hard  for in spite of enormous odds) is the cause of all of her anxiety and feelings of inadequacy. Note that he is SIX HOURS AWAY and he rarely speaks to any of them. You can argue that he is presenting a false accounting of the events of the session and their lives, but his sister could be doing the same.\n\n\n>The therapist may be wrong factually or clinically (but we certainly don\u2019t know that), but she got her info from Sister and was acting in Sister's interest - which is her obligation.\n\nIs it really in her best interest to say \"yes, your brother's success is the root of all of your mental health problems and the solution is to bring him here and cast him out of the family\"? Sometimes validation is harm. I'm not suggesting invalidation as a solution, but instead of playing into the scapegoating of OP, perhaps it would have been more helpful to actually work on her self esteem and anxiety. Her obligation is to act in sister's best interests, but it could easily be argued that she has failed to do that. \n\nIf your sibling's success is causing you to feel badly about yourself, the solution is not to kick that person out of the family. There will be others who make her feel inadequate if she doesn't resolve her low self esteem.\n\n>Note that sister is in agreement with the therapist.\n\nOf course she is.

That's specific outcome is not something that a therapist should be encouraging, much less participating in, and it seems fairly clearly to be premediated by both sister and therapist.  Like \"lets lure my brother here under false pretenses so you can tell him how my problems are his fault\" is like nine different kinds of not the shit a therapist should be involved in.  \n\nOP isn't saying the session went long enough that he disclosed things that the therapist then reacted to. What OP reports the therapist as saying, is more like dumping things from previous 1 on 1 sessions onto OP, before collecting any confirming, or challenging, information from OP about the story they're running on.  The therapist themselves telling someone, who barely has contact with their client, that they need to \"step back\" is a basic and fundamental failure of due diligence.  \n\nSpeculating wildly, I'm a little left wondering if this person was actually 'real' therapist and that's perhaps some of why OP's *family* is super freaked out that OP filed a complaint.

Your parents cannot face the idea that they are potentially responsible for her problems, and your sister can't face that either because she depends on them and she probably believes that they were always good to her, so you must be the problem. I would not be surprised if your parents shopped around for an unethical therapist who would help them solidify the family myth that they are perfectly fine and  *you* are the entire problem. \n\nThis prevents their princess from straying because now an expert has rubber stamped the family myth, and it gives your parents reassurance that they did everything right but \"sometimes a kid just goes wrong\". Bringing you in for this scapegoating and rejection further solidifies the myth *and removes the threat that your success presents to the myth*. When you were asked to \"take a step back\", they were kicking you out of the family. I'm so sorry.

What he never understood was that I stood out because I was just being myself and doing what felt right to me.
