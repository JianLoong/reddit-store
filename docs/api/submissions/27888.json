I\u2019m the older sibling, clocking in at 25, and my sister\u2019s 20. Our family dynamic has always been... well, complicated.\n\nMy parents have been together for a long time, and they always wanted a daughter, even before I was born. When I came along, they were a bit bummed but not too disappointed. They kept trying for another child and faced some conception troubles, even seeking help from a clinic.\n\nEventually, they succeeded and were overjoyed when they found out it was a girl. They told me to be a good role model and keep her safe, which made me happy as a 5-year-old.\n\nHowever, things changed after my sister was born. My relationship with my parents shifted dramatically. I felt sidelined, almost like I didn't matter anymore. I didn't get birthday celebrations, gifts, or a close connection with my parents. They said they had to focus on my younger sister because she was little, and I needed to understand that.\n\nGrowing up, my parents treated my sister and me totally differently. They made me get a job at 14 to help with bills and rent, while my sister didn't have to. I never got the same treatment as her - she got new stuff, and I had to work for everything with my part-time job, even though I had to give half of my earnings to my parents. My sister was the favorite, and we never got along well.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I worked hard and got into medical school. But my parents said they couldn't afford to help me out, which really annoyed me. I decided to go anyway and worked my butt off to pay for everything. Despite the challenges, I finished my degree and started my residency.\n\nMy sister just finished high school and got into this pricey private college, living on her own with our parents' full support. I've kinda made peace with their favoritism, keeping my distance since I barely see them - living in a different city and all. So, when I visited recently, my sister shocked me by suggesting we go to therapy together. I thought it might help us patch things up, but the therapist ended up blaming me for all my sister's issues, saying I needed to step back for her mental health. I got seriously pissed, confronted the therapist, and, of course, my sister and parents took her side, leaving me fuming.\n\nSince I believe what the therapist did was unethical, I filed a complaint against the her, thinking it was the right thing to do. Turns out, it's not as anonymous as I thought, and now my parents are begging me to withdraw it, claiming it'll hurt the person who was apparently \"helping their princess.\" I had enough and hightailed it out of there, driving six hours back to my place, still seething and feeling like I could've handled the whole mess better.\n\nNow, I can't say I'm not feeling like shit. I hate this situation, and while I don't feel like all I did was undeserving, maybe I should have handled it differently. So, Reddit, AITA?\n\nNote: I'm not on the US or Europe.", "created_utc": 1696011251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vixv2/aita_for_reporting_my_sisters_therapist/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was out of line and any therapist who actually encourages unhealthy relationships shouldn't be in the field at all. Please don't withdraw it because if they did it to you then they probably did it to someone who can't / wont stand up to them.", "NTA You filed a complaint with your  point of view of the therapist. If whatever body that reads these things agrees with you then you were right. If they disagree they'll dismiss it & move on. You're entitled to voice your  disapproval... especially since it sounds like the therapist ignored your  pov during the sessions. Your sister sounds like a train wreck  & your parents are welcome to the monster that they've created. It won't end well of either.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you put up with your family\u2019s BS your whole life. You\u2019ve finally put your foot down (which is good) so of course they are retaliating.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine 1 report about the therapist being mildly unethical is going to ruin the therapist\u2019s career (unless the therapist has a history of fucking up like this) in which case it is deserved. You were well within your rights to submit the report either way.\n\nBest of luck!", "This seems off. I\u2019m a psychologist and have had to report other clinicians before. They give you the option to remain anonymous. And even if you opt to give your identity, they don\u2019t reach out and inform the therapist.", "This seems so very odd. Can you share any specifics on why the therapist thought you were responsible for the princess's problems?", "NTA, if you barely even see your family you can hardly be a problem for your sister, and the therapist suggesting that is likely a result of blindly believing whatever your sister told them. Probably best to stay away from them.", "NTA,\n\nSorry you had to go through this. But the complaint was definitely warranted, therapy should be unbiased. That honestly sounds like a setup or they were paid to cuddle your sister, super weird. At least you found a level of success and independence away from them. Probably better for your own mental health to go no contact", "NTA - if whatever agency doesn't have an issue with it, they'll dismiss the report. \n\nSounds like you don't owe your parents or sister anything and you can deal with them all however you want.  \n\n\nTake care of your own mental health", "NTA. Therapist are supposed to be neutral. Your family sounds horrible and you are successful despite them . You should go no contact with them you\u2019ll probably be a lot happier", "Incompetent therapists take a bad situation and make it terrible, he/she also was not doing the sister any favours by reinforcing the notion that she cant do anything wrong set in place by her parents. As bad as they were to you, teaching their daughter she\u2019s perfect and cant do any wrong then setting her out into a world that\u2019s going to have no problem showing her that\u2019s not true is another form of abuse. Just cut contact, nobody is worth ruining your mental health.", "NTA, about time you put your foot down. The therapist sounds unprofessional and to have swallowed the family's BS hook, line and sinker.\n\nCongrats for all you achieved in life despite your mistreatment at home, may you one day find true love and caring!", "NTA.  You clearly owe these folks nothing but contempt.  Leave them to their devices.  Leave the ambush therapist with a complaint.  Run fast.  Don\u2019t look back ever.  Do not reopen a dialog with these three, ever.", "**NTA** \\- It will always be your fault.  Did the therapist present herself as your therapist to help you and your sister or did she present herself as your sister's therapist.  In the latter case, I believe it would be hard to make a case against her.  I have heard of these therapy ambushes before.  The justification is that it is in the client's best interest to validate their feelings and not explore whether the memories are accurate.\n\nBut, if you think that the therapist was unethical, you are obligated to report her.", "NTA. Your experience with the therapist is yours to judge.  I have cousins who kept trying for a boy and now have 8 children. The last one, the favorite is finally a boy. Its all too absurd for me. Ask your parents, \"In what world am I supposed to just accept being treated poorly to make somebody else happy? Are you serious?\"", "Nta It sounds like the therapist was purposefully driving a wedge between you two. It\u2019s obvious your step sis talked shit about you before that appointment and the therapist let you have it.", "NTA what the therapist did was unprofessional and to be honest disgraceful. \n\nAlso cut these awful people out of your life. They bring nothing positive to you", "Nta dont  redact the complaint  go NC with your family. They just want to drag you down", "Not clinical, but am an educational psychologist and work with those mental health clinicians. That is so enethical...it's like they set you up. Why does she have issues because of you? Because you are independent and succeeding in life? WTF? \n\nNTA. Keep the complaint. Your family doesn't sound worth your time and your own mental health.", "NTA. Are they even a real therapist?", "INFO:  What did you report the therapist for?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBlaming you is unfair but hardly seems unethical.", "NTA, you did the right thing. You will save some other person from getting bad therapy. I'm sorry that happened to you.", "NTA, it sounds like the therapist made a snap judgement based on the one side she\u2019s been hearing without giving you a chance to have your say. Family therapy is supposed to be about everyone talking out in the open, not a way to single out one family member without having all the information. I\u2019d say the therapist made a serious mistake and I agree with your decision to report her for unethical behavior. Unfortunately her career will be impacted but she should have thought about that before she suggested they all corner you.", "NTA you have been the scapegoat your whole life and then the therapist piled on. Don't withdraw that complaint.", "Nta just because you made a complaint doesn\u2019t mean they will punish her unless they find cause too. So you have clean hands. Your sister needs help and this therapist clearly isn\u2019t doing well if your parents are in contact with her", "Nta. Don\u2019t withdraw it. It will probably amount to nothing but do not withdraw it bc some good could come from it. With that said\u2026I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. No contact is real and can be a wonderful tool for healing.", "NTA IF the therapist didn\u2019t do anything wrong then the report will find her in the clear and you don\u2019t need to retract it. If she redid then she should be holed up. We\u2019ll done on doing so well, sounds like your sister is impressed with your achievements too but sadly she compares instead of feeling good about it. Maybe write her a long letter saying how it\u2019s been for you growing up, the favouritism etc and that\u2019s the reason you keep distance. It\u2019s also be interesting if after she read that to hear her point of view written on her own treatment etc and if she realised the difference", "INFO: \n\nyou didn't give details on how involved you were with your sister or how you treated her. You also did not say what problems she was going to the therapist for.\n\nSo it's hard to decide who TA is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You filed the complaint, it's not up to you what the outcome is.   \n\nCan you go no contact with your family?   Is there anything left to salvage?\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. I think this is a bad take by the therapist, but I don't think it would rise to the level of something so unethical she'd face serious consequences for her license. But that doesn't mean it's a bad thing to report her, you don't know exactly where the line is and the licensing board or whoever can make a further determination.", "NTA I feel like your parents probably bribed the therapist to blame you for everything so you would feel guilty and to pay for the pricey private school she wants to go to. Go no contact with these cretins and live your best life.", "YTA.  So basically, the therapist told you things that your sister didn't have the courage to tell you, and you got pissed and reported the therapist? That about sum it up?", "Part of this depends on the ethical code of conduct for professional therapists in the country/region/province/state you're in. You note you're not in the US or Europe so most of us on Reddit don't have a frame of reference. \n\nAlso, was your sister already in therapy and asked you join a session so that you could be part of the process/to facilitate a conversation? Or did you both agree to do joint therapy and find this therapist together. In the US at least, there are different professional/ethical expectations if two people are in a therapy session together and both are considered clients/patients (like couples counseling) or one person is the client and a person from their life joins a session to help with their progress. In the second scenario, therapists have different responsibilities to their client vs. an additional party in the session and your complaint to their licensing body would be out of line. At least that's how it works where I live. \n\nYou don't go into much detail, but if you joined your sister's therapy session where you having this conversation within a safe space for her to share that she needed to step back from your relationship a bit and the therapist was there to help her say her piece and have support if she had anxiety or other issues? You sound angry and hurt about this so perhaps we're getting your view as a narrator and your sister and her (our your joint?) therapist would have a different telling. If, for example, your sister has begun to realize she's the golden child she may be sorting out how to reconceptualize her entire childhood and family relationships. Golden children are harmed growing up in an unhealthy household as well as the scapegoated kids, just in a different way. Maybe she's having anxiety and guilt about this realization and needs space to process it and is asking you for that space. Or, maybe you treat her with anger and disgust (but don't seem aware of it) because of the way your parents pitted you against one another and she doesn't have the coping skills to deal with that yet?\n\nThis is all supposition, but by your own admission you got seriously pissed during the session, so perhaps you didn't catch the nuance of the situation. There are clearly some details missing.", "Exactly. And it\u2019s obvious that he did nothing wrong here (parents, therapist, and yes, his sister are the AHs here) I think there\u2019s no better way he could\u2019ve handled this situation. He reported the unprofessional therapist, and didn\u2019t stick around to listen to his parents\u2019 verbal abuse.", "Agreed.  One report shouldn't matter especially if the board doesn't see it as a big deal.", "Yeah, things are a bit strange in my country. They don't really give you the option of being anonymous, but I didn't expect the complaint to carry my name if they ever informed her.\n\nI agree with you that this is completely absurd. But I can't do much about it now.", "Sure. She claims she compares herself too much with me, which affects her mental health greatly. Giving her anxiety, among other problems.", "I think you mean coddle, paying someone to cuddle her would be a different line of work", "PS Contrats on your achievements!!!", "Essentially, they invited me there to corner me and essentially just blame me for... well, for existing. Both of them were.\n\nI don't think that's the job of a therapist, so I wrote a detailed report of what transpired. I essentially reported them for misconduct of behavior (not sure if this is the proper English term.)\n\nSorry for being vague.", "I agree. I don\u2019t see any ethical violation here. Anyone can report anyone for anything but I doubt the therapist will get into any trouble.", "Since there's a limit on characters on the post. I had to try to keep it short. Sorry about that.\n\nMy sister and I never got along. She was the princess and knew it. She tormented me, blamed me for everything, and made sure to abuse her favour.\n\nShe goes to the therapist to treat her mental health. She claims she compares herself too much with me, and a few other things.\n\nAgain, sorry for being vague.", "After reading through all the comments, I ask you a question about your sister.\n\nI know she was barely a teenager when you left. \n\nWould you consider your sister a narcissist?  or perhaps very manipulative?\n\n I ask because the way you describe being blindsided, and then attacked doesn't sit right with me.  It is as if you sister had this planned from the beginning.", "Wow. And what were you expected to do? Fail at your own goals so that she can feel superior? \n\nThis still seems so weird. I don't know why a professional would take that position. Normally, one would expect them to work on her feelings of inadequacy by building up her own self-image, not scapegoat a relative.  \n\nDo you taunt her or constantly flaunt your success? Do you project resentment over your parent's favoritism? I'm just wondering if there was specific guidance that the counselor offered. What did she mean by \"step back\"?", "No worries pal, this gave me a better idea. NTA then. My younger brother is like that, the golden child who still rants because, despite his vexations, I got to earn more than him. Probably, the therapist got played. I wouldn't have reported her though.", "Wait - so what were you supposed to do to make her feel better? Stop being successful?", "That's exactly what i thought because it doesn't make sense to me otherwise. She definitely planned this whole thing beforehand.\nclearly OP's NTA", "Absolutely not. I would never taunt someone, especially my sister. Look, I do resent her, but not to the point of causing her distress.\n\nI still don't know what she meant by taking a step back. As mentioned, I barely see my sister ever since I left home.", "NTA  \n\nYou have no idea what your sister has told the therapist. In her version of events you may be an ever present force constantly undermining your sister.\n\nYou were set up by your sister as the scapegoat for whatever problems or failures she is refusing to address. \n\nThe therapist needs reporting and extensive supervision at the very least. They overstepped the professional boundaries. You're training to be a Doctor you need to protect future patients from the massive amount of harm this therapist could cause if left unchecked."]}
