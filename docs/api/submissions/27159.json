{"id": 27159, "submission_id": "16m4wuc", "title": "AITA for asking my wife's ex-husband to not always do fun things with my stepson?", "selftext": "I have a son (11) and a daughter (13) from a previous relationship and my wife has a 7 year old son with her ex-husband. I have custody of my children 2 weeks on/2 weeks off. My wife has primary custody of her son, and he has visitation with his dad every other Friday afternoon to Monday morning. His dad also takes him for 6 (mostly seperate) weeks throughout the year. \n\n\rMy stepson always comes back from his dads with fun stories and never fails to have a good time. This past weekend they went to a monster truck rally, the weekend before it was survival camping, and before that an amusement park. \n\n\rI'm glad he gets to go and have a good time but it's becoming increasingly frustrating for my wife and me. We don't have the time to make our weekends with him just as exciting and during the week we have to do the everyday things that go into raising a child. I know my son is jealous of his stepbrother always coming back home and talking about all the fun things he did with his dad. We do other fun things, but my son always seems to want to do the things his stepbrother gets to do.\n\n\rPart of the issues is also just lifestyle differences. My daughter is in competitive dance and my son competitive soccer, so this takes up a lot of our time in the evenings and weekends. \n\n\rLast night I had to pick my stepson up from his dad's house because his dad had to leave home early the next morning for a work trip. We ended up chatting for a bit and I mentioned to him about it being hard on my son when stepson comes back with all these fun things to tell him about his weekend. He sarcastically apologized and asked what he was supposed to do about it. I told him it wouldn't be too hard for him to not always jam pack his weekends with all these fun activities and suggested that stepson could be getting more involved in sports instead. At that point stepson was ready to go and our conversation mostly ended there.\n\n\rI ended up telling my wife what I had said thinking she would agree but she thinks I was an asshole. I thought she agreed about it being frustrating having to compete with disney dad but although she said she did, she also would still rather her son think she's boring and still get to go on adventures with his dad. We started arguing and she accused me of making too many excuses about why I don't take my kids to do more activities/outings. She brought up this past weekend where she took my kids bowling and out for dinner and shopping while I stayed at home. (I had to wake up insanely early that same morning to take my son to his soccer game.) She's also now worried her ex is going to think she put me up to saying what I did and is thinking about texting him to apologize which would be embarrassing for me. AITA here? I just want my stepson to have a calmer routine and am trying to look out for my own son's feelings?\r", "created_utc": 1695065559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16m4wuc/aita_for_asking_my_wifes_exhusband_to_not_always/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is this for real??  It sounds like you're the ex-husband pretending to be you to show you how ridiculous you're being.\n\nYTA.\n\nYou openly admit that most of your and your wife's free time is spent on YOUR kids, yet you want to stop your stepson from having fun with his dad?  And it's only once every two weeks!  You sound horrible.\n\nThis poor kid has had his world torn apart by divorce.  He has no choice about living with you or the fact that his mother seems to spend most of her weekends on your kids.  I sincerely hope your wife's ex told you to \\*\\*\\*\\* off when you suggested making life even harder for your stepson by taking away his fun experiences.  What is wrong with you.\n\nYou need to stay completely out of parenting decisions involving your stepson and your wife needs to be ashamed that she is allowing her own kid to come last in your household.\n\nIt is a common complaint that fathers who only see their kids on weekends act like Santa Claus.  If your wife and you are steady and stable and can actually be there for your stepson instead of making his life about your kids' activities, then your stepson will see your place as home.  If you make him second-best and he has to spend his time watching his mother support your kids at their events, then of course he'll develop a closer connection to his father.\n\nYou can't have it both ways.  You can't marginalize this kid and then whine that he likes his father better.", "YTA\n\n \n\n>it's becoming increasingly frustrating for my wife and me.\n\n I fail to see why her ex would care about you two. He cares about his son, not you and not your kids. \n\n>my son always seems to want to do the things his stepbrother gets to do.\n\nThat seems like a you problem. \n\n>it wouldn't be too hard for him to not always jam pack his weekends with all these fun activities and suggested that stepson could be getting more involved in sports instead.\n\n Your entitlement knows no bonds. It's not his job to stop providing for his kid just because you can't do the same. \n\n>I just want my stepson to have a calmer routine\n\nYou don't care about your stepson, you're just pissy that he put you in a bad light.", "You actually asked your wife's ex to do less fun things with your step-son because you don't want to have to expend the effort to do cool things with your own kids?  And you're the guy who couldn't be bothered to go bowling and have fun with your kids last weekend because you had to get up early the next day?  Ummmm....wow.\n\nAnd way to support and nurture your step-son, by the way.  Let's make his relationship with his dad less enjoyable.\n\nYTA.  The way to fix this is for you to do more, not for your step-son's dad to do less.", "YTA. Instead of parenting your own kids, you decided to make it your wife's ex problem so you don't have to deal with it.\n\nLife is not fair. You kids made the choice to do competitive sports. That comes with responsibilities. It's your time to step up and teach them that they can't have it all.", "Lets get this straight, you want to reduce the fun your step son has so you don't look as bad.

Essentially...\n\n*Hi, bio-dad of stepson, can you pretty please stop being such an kick-ass awesome father, because my own bio-kids are realizing that I suck in comparison?*\n\nDid I get that right?\n\nYTA, in case it wasn't obvious. Your wife shouldn't be the one apologizing. You should be the one writing and sending that text, apologizing sincerely, no matter how embarrassing that is to you.\n\nIt's perfectly possible that you are exhausted, perhaps even burned out. Your post hasn't given me enough context to tell either way. But I am missing one vital piece of information from your post: did you ever actually ask your kids what they themselves prefer? Competitive sports over spending more fun time with you? Because you've said so yourself: your son would like to do the \"fun stuff\" similar to his stepbrother. So why are you still having him do competitive sports? Does he even want to, or is that just the lifestyle you arbitrarily forced on him?\n\nSimilarly... Have you ever sat down with your family, talk to them, explaining to them that you'd like to do more \"fun stuff\" with them, but you don't have the energy because of reasons \\[x\\], \\[y\\] and \\[z\\], and what can be done to make sure that you do gain that energy in the near future?\n\nMy point is... I'm not seeing any attempt at problem-solving in your post. Only complaining.", "YTA\n\n>My daughter is in competitive dance and my son competitive soccer, so this takes up a lot of our time in the evenings and weekends.\n\nSo you find time for YOUR children activities? What does your stepson do while you devote evenings and weekends to your children? Shouldn't you limit their \"hobby time\" so  your stepson doesn't feel bad or excluded?", "Yta. It's not a competition and what matters is he's happy. Your wife is awesome. Calmer routine doesn't fly for an 11 edited to  add - I hope she texts her ex  . You already embarrassed yourself", "YTA\n\nSomehow you think your step son having less enjoyment in his life will make you seem a better father?  \n\nHis father puts in effort and obviously the child enjoy it. You want to stop that, and you don\u2019t think your the asshole? \n\nYTA", "YTA. You actually asked your stepsons BIO DAD to not do fun stuff with him just because your two kids are jealous? Your wife\u2019s ex has no responsibility on how your two kids feel. Instead of asking him to not do this, actually parent your kids and find a time for everyone to do something fun. And your wife is right. You do make a lot of excuses to not do fun stuff with them. I doubt dance competitions are every weekend and I doubt soccer competitions are every other week that dance competitions aren\u2019t. \n\nIt seems like your wife was able to do something with them without any problems. Sounds like it\u2019s a YOU problem", "Yta.  First off it\u2019s not your kid and not your place to even say anything.  Second your kids are old enough to understand that when you are involved in competitive sports, it takes a lot of time and you don\u2019t have time to do other fun things.", "YTA\n\nYou want to diminish the joy of a seven year old to soothe your own insecurities. You should be ashamed. Maybe talking to a therapist will help you see that a child's happiness and wellbeing should always outweigh your ego - especially a child in your own family. \n\nYou should apologize to stepson's dad yourself. Respect the boundaries and make changes to your own life to better suit your family's needs. You don't get to displace that responsibility onto another parent. Do better.", "I'm so curious why you thought any of this was a good idea?  YTA", "This man is trying to make the most of what little time he has with his son, and you want him to stop because you can\u2019t be bothered to do the same with your own children. Do you know how many single mothers would kill for an involved father for their child? \n\nYTA", "YTA.  How would you feel if a rando told you to stop doing fun things with your kids?\n\nWhy are you even get into it with this man?  I\u2019d be so pissed of I was your wife.", "Yes, YTA. Why would a decent person not want his stepson to have a good relationship with his father? You're a major asshole for that.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your step-son or his dad\u2019s fault that you don\u2019t have time to do \u201cfun\u201d stuff. You\u2019re going to make your step-son suffer because your son is jealous of the stuff he gets to do?\n\nSit your son down and tell him you\u2019re sorry you don\u2019t have the ability to do some of these things. Better yet\u2014make the time. You see your kids every two weeks. Plan something once in a while.", "Your stepson's father has no obligation to cater towards the feelings of your biological children.  He is allowed to take his son on fun outings.\n\nWhy should your stepson be ou wished for your feelings of inadequacy?\n\nYTA", "YTA - His dad is better than me because I would have told you to F\\*\\*\\* off and GTFOH. LOL It's not your job to police his dad on what he can do with his own son. Instead be a parent to your own. Acknowledge that yes stepbro may get to have fun outings with his dad but that (1) his dad only gets to spend time with him 5 to 6 days a month, and (2) that your son is in a competitive sport that takes money and a lot of time on the weekends so obviously there's less time to do other things when they have to be at an all day soccer tournament. Your son is old enough to know and understand this.\n\nAnd I would like to add honestly... stay in your lane too about the sports. Good that your kids are into them but not every kid is. If your step-son wants to be involved in them he will let you guys know, but pushing him into it when he doesn't want to be is just going to cause him to be miserable and cause him resentment towards you.", "YTA!! You can't tell the other parent what they can or can't do on their time with their child!! If your son is feeling left out then you need to figure that out. Your stepson is not responsible for your son's feelings.", "YTA \n\nIf your kids have an issue, then perhaps they need to drop sports to do more of those activities.", "YTA. On so many levels. Having this conversation behind your wife s back is unfair to her. Perhaps focus on your own child, rather than guilt tripping your wife s ex on how he spends time with his own 7 year old son.", " JFC, is there no common sense left in this world? Of course YTA. There is no universe where you are not an asshole. I don\u2019t know how you got to adulthood not learning life isn\u2019t, some people get to to things others can\u2019t!", "YTA. You have no say in how your wife's ex-husband spends time with his own son. It's insane that you thought it was okay to tell him not to do fun things with his kid, because it makes YOUR kid jealous. Seriously? I also think the last paragraph of your post is super telling. Your wife sided with her ex-husband, and said YOU make too many excuses as to why you don't do more things with your own kids. \n\nThis is 100% a situation of your own making. Don't tell someone else to stop spending quality time with their kid just because you don't like spending time with your kids. Man up and start planning more activities and fun things with your kids. If your wife is finding time to take them bowling, then you can find time to do other fun things with them too.", "YTA - You could do fun things with the other kids, but you choose not to.  Your kids are also waking up early, you could have gone bowling - you choose not to.  This is on you.", "YTA, you cannot do fun stuff with him as your children are in competitive dance and soccer and you are too busy, so you want his bio dad to tone it down and not have fun with him.", "YTA. You can't ask your stepson's father to make *less* of an effort with his own son so that you don't look bad by comparison, for goodness's sake. You're asking him to be a less fun and involved dad to ease your own insecurities, which is a bit pathetic. Either do more fun stuff with the kids, or let it go, but your wife is right.", "There are many other ways to go about this situation other than trying to take the fun away from your stepson\u2026\n\nFor starters, stop making the situation about YOU and start making it about your kids. You had an opportunity to do something fun with your kids and you chose to stay home instead because you were tired from your son\u2019s early morning soccer game\u2026 Didn\u2019t your son get up early too and actually play in the soccer game\u2026?\n\nYTA. Step up your game, don\u2019t ask your stepson\u2019s dad to tone his down.", "YTA - You are trying to coerce a 7 year old to not talk about fun times. WTF is wrong with you? You are a horrible step parent, and do not sound like much of a parent either, as you wife seems to be doing those duties.\n\nStep it up!!", "Massive YTA. Your son gets attention by having a father who wakes up insanely early on weekends for him and spends evening and afternoons on him. Stepson has a dad who puts equal effort, just on different things, and this is what you should explain to your children and to yourself.", "YTA\n\nYes you need to apologize to the Disney dad\u2026. You want your stepson to not have fun with his dad because you are too tired to do fun things with your son\u2026 definitely the AH", "YTA. Your wife\u2019s ex sees his son much less, so he wants to make the time memorable. It seems he\u2019s exchanged being involved in sports for other activities. You might want to reevaluate how much time your kids put into competitive activities if they are jealous. But, if your kids love their sports, remind them that sometimes you have to choose.\n\nFinally, didn\u2019t your son manage to get up insanely early too? He still managed to go out for the evening with your wife. You may need to change your priorities.", "YTA. You don't want to / can't take him to do fun things with your own family, so you just want him to not get to do as many fun things, period? That sounds more like an issue with your self esteem as a father/step father than an issue with the other family.", "Who chose for your kids to do competitive sports? Maybe they want a different lifestyle, more akin to your stepson's. Maybe you need to sit them down and ask them. Maybe you need to rethink YOUR parenting. But you had zero right to say anything to your stepson's father about how he raises his kid, let alone with the reasoning that it made it hard for you to explain to your kids. As a kid, I'd prefer to have exciting weekend adventures twice a month over rigid early morning competitive sports that consume all my free time. What lessons are you teaching your kids at such a young age that competitive dance and soccer are the better options? Because as a parent, they aren't. They suck.\n\nYTA", "Dude YTA. You want to take away these special moments from your stepson just to ease your insecurities. If you\u2019re worried about your child\u2019s feelings then plan more fun activities instead. You also say you don\u2019t want your wife to apologize for your mistakes because it\u2019s embarrassing. Is this the example you want to set for your children? You messed up. Own up to it and apologize to your stepson\u2019s dad yourself.", "Oh lord, just read the title on your own post and you can't possibly not see YTA. You told a father to have less fun with his son? You think you'd be okay if that was your son you were trying to condemn to \"less fun\" times? You owe apologies to your wife and to her ex. I really hope your stepson didn't hear you make this gaffe.", "YTA. And it's clear to every adult in the room why.", "A father can do whatever fun activities he wants to do with HIS fucking child. Being jealous isn\u2019t it\u2026\u2026YTA", "YTA.  Stepson's dad is giving it his all, and you're phoning it in. Your solution is to ask your stepson's dad to stop doing doing his best so you won't look so bad. \n\nYou want to look better? Do better.", "YTA - He is making the most of the time he has with his son, and it sounds like it is a good time.  Make time to do fun things with your kids, if competitive soccer and competitive dance are getting in the way, ask them which they would rather do, the fun activity or another practice session?  Kids should be able to have fun.", "YTA. If your kids want to do cool stuff as well, then they are welcome to quit their competitive sports.  They can\u2019t have it both ways.  Can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too a lot of the time.", "YTA\n\nSo because you can't (or it sounds like won't is more accurate) do fun things with your children, you want someone else to be a terrible father so you're not shown up?\n\nApart from how selfish and cruel that request is, you also have zero say in anything to do with your stepson. You're not his parent, and you should not have said anything, *especially* without your wife's consent.", "Wow, YTA. Parent your own kids and find time to do fun things with them. Leave your stepson alone, good for him that he gets to have fun with his dad, I hope he continues doing so. Your kids (I hope) made the choice to do competitive sports and now they have to live with that. Tough. Stepson doesn't want to so he gets fun outings instead.\n\nAlso your wife is right. You massively overstepped and her ex could very well think that it's coming from her. You've put her in a shitty situation.", "YTA.\n\n\"We do other fun things, but my son always seems to want to do the things his stepbrother gets to do.\" - that's not the other parent's problem. \n\nYou don't get to control what his dad does with him.", "There's SO many things wrong with your thought process.

I understand the frustration as I have two kids with my ex and one with husband #2 and the older two would come back from visitation with stories of their exciting adventures with dad. It helped for me to set aside one on one time with the older two and have them tell me all about the exciting things they did that week or weekend. I asked them to be mindful of their younger sibling when talking about the fun they had but still gave the opportunity to share their awesome adventures with me. It seemed to work. Husband #2 and I tried to make special time with our child when their siblings were gone so #3 would have special memories to share too. It doesnt have to be expensive or take an entire week - things like a special picnic at the beach, or a hike to see something cool in nature, or a bike ride somewhere new and different. Making time for one on one time with all of your kids is so important. They get special parent time with attention focused only on them and they learn that people get to have different experiences without feeling FOMO. Doing this kept a harmonious balance in my household that worked for us and kept anyone from being envious or feeling \u201cless than\u201d anyone else.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour son's better dad would be an AH to listen to you.

I have custody of my children 2 weeks on/2 weeks off. My wife has primary custody of her son, and he has visitation with his dad every other Friday afternoon to Monday morning. His dad also takes him for 6 (mostly seperate) weeks throughout the year. \n\n\rMy stepson always comes back from his dads with fun stories and never fails to have a good time. This past weekend they went to a monster truck rally, the weekend before it was survival camping, and before that an amusement park. \n\n\rI'm glad he gets to go and have a good time but it's becoming increasingly frustrating for my wife and me. We don't have the time to make our weekends with him just as exciting and during the week we have to do the everyday things that go into raising a child. I know my son is jealous of his stepbrother always coming back home and talking about all the fun things he did with his dad. We do other fun things, but my son always seems to want to do the things his stepbrother gets to do.\n\n\rPart of the issues is also just lifestyle differences. My daughter is in competitive dance and my son competitive soccer, so this takes up a lot of our time in the evenings and weekends. \n\n\rLast night I had to pick my stepson up from his dad's house because his dad had to leave home early the next morning for a work trip. We ended up chatting for a bit and I mentioned to him about it being hard on my son when stepson comes back with all these fun things to tell him about his weekend. He sarcastically apologized and asked what he was supposed to do about it. I told him it wouldn't be too hard for him to not always jam pack his weekends with all these fun activities and suggested that stepson could be getting more involved in sports instead. At that point stepson was ready to go and our conversation mostly ended there.\n\n\rI ended up telling my wife what I had said thinking she would agree but she thinks I was an asshole. I thought she agreed about it being frustrating having to compete with disney dad but although she said she did, she also would still rather her son think she's boring and still get to go on adventures with his dad. We started arguing and she accused me of making too many excuses about why I don't take my kids to do more activities/outings. She brought up this past weekend where she took my kids bowling and out for dinner and shopping while I stayed at home. (I had to wake up insanely early that same morning to take my son to his soccer game.) She's also now worried her ex is going to think she put me up to saying what I did and is thinking about texting him to apologize which would be embarrassing for me. AITA here? I just want my stepson to have a calmer routine and am trying to look out for my own son's feelings?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You okay?", "No. It is the bounden duty of every ex-wife to do everything in her power to make her ex-husband's life as shitty as possible.", "You\u2019re unbelievable and I have second hand embarrassment for you. \n\nI\u2019m not surprised your wife was mortified and I\u2019ll nearly guarantee she\u2019s already apologised to her ex for your awful comments. \n\nThe relationship between your stepson and his dad are absolutely nothing to do with you. Why don\u2019t you try doing fun stuff with your own kids instead of trying to stop your stepson and his dad? \n\nYeah YTA, stepson is going to have some great memories to look back on with his dad, what will he have to look back on with you?", "YTA The only person you care about her is you and your son. \n\nYou admit yourself you dont have time to do fun things  with step son because of your son and daughter being in competitive sports. Now you want him to stop fun activities with his dad because you dont do them with your kids. \n\nYou dont make the effort to have fun and. get to know your children outside of sports  is not the problem of step son and hus dad.\n\nDo you dictate on what your ex does with your children? Does your wife complain your ex about what she can do with with her children ?\n\nYou are punishing your stepson because his dad is active in a different way from you.", "YTA. You can't dictate on someone how to spend their quality time with their kid. You and your son can suck it up. \n\nIn your last paragraph you say that your wife took out your kids for a fun day out and you stayed home. You say that you had to wake up early for your son's soccer game. Wasn't your son in that outing with your wife? Wasn't he supposed to wake up early too? But he went out instead. \n\nJust because you don't have the same standards as your wife's ex doesn't mean he should stop doing fun things with his kid. You can either step up on your duties as a father or just be quiet.", "Yes it would be embarrassing for you if she apologies when you should be the one. \n\nYeah its frustrating and tough and not 100% fair but you really have no right to ask that of him. YTA but not because of what you said completely more because you are still adamant that you are right even after the conversation with your wife\n\nIts really not hard to say sorry i said those things out of frustration and I know I crossed a line. People would actually respect you more for owning your mistakes", "I wonder how people lack self awareness to the degree you do and still go along their lives in a society. YTA", "YTA so basically you want the father of your stepson to adjust his plans to fit in with your kids wants and desires and you want him to push (force) your stepson to stop doing what he loves and start doing what your kids enjoy doing to make it easier for you! \n\nYour son is asking more from you not asking for less for his stepbrother.   \n\nStep up talk to your son discuss what he wants in his life talk about compromise with him that if he does some of these other things means less time for football etc you know parent.", "Have you ever looked into low testosterone? You sound completely disinterested in parenting and would rather foist off the kids to teachers and coaches so you don't have to deal with them every night. If this is an inaccurate assessment then you definitely need to get your testosterone levels checked because unless you're in your 50s you shouldn't be so tired.", "YTA: It isn't about you. You should be thinking about how your child feels.  You're saying \"can you make my child feel worse because that would make me feel better\".\n\nYou should talk to someone about those feelings. I don't think that's a healthy place to be.", "Oh well\u2026 YTA. And also some kind of freak. It\u2019s your fault you\u2019re time and cash poor lmao", "YTA- Your son was able to get up extremely early for the soccer game that he participated in while You sat there and watched and he still went bowling. Stepsons dad isn\u2019t doing anything wrong in this case as it seems you just don\u2019t want to go do things with your own kids and its making it obvious to your own children.", "You must be a f...ing idiot!", "Oh, and yes, YTA!", "YTA", "YTA. You are jealous of the things the father does with his stepson. Stepson only gets a small amount of time with his father-it should be fun. \nAlso, your wife is right. Do more with your kids. \nHonestly, the audacity of you asking him to do less\u2026", "YTA, your stepson have a family and a \"fun dad\". Your wife's ex-husband is a weekend dad with ni responsibilities for every day routines. Let him fill the weekends with fun stuff if he wants to.\n\nYour wife is also very correct, you \\_could\\_ do more with your kids. **She** took your kids out for bowling, dinner and shopping but you stayed home? And if you were up insanely early for your son's soccer game, didn't he also get up early but still had the energy to go out with your wife?\n\nYou suck it up! Our kids have several activities but we still do a family activity every saturday. Doesn't matter if we've done tons of other things together that week, saturday we do a family activity. It could be an outing but also just a family movie at home. But we do it together because we want to have fun with our kids and create fun memories with them.", "Let's rephrase that: he asked the wife's ex to do less fun things WITH HIS OWN SON! Entitled much?", "Not to mention, how do you think the kids really want to be in competitive sports ? Both of them ? Nah, I don\u2019t think so.\n\ni think op put them up to it for his own pride , and that the kids would rather have a Fun dad than a coach.", "Honestly the step dad was probably so fkn shocked he didnt even know how to react besides his sarcastic answer. Hell, he probably thought OP was kidding at first since its such an absolutely unhinged request to make of somebody.", "Your hypothetical would require him to do fun things with his kids. And how could he possibly go bowling with his son when he has to get up *insanely early* to drive his son to soccer?", "He just wants to pawn his responsibilities of being a \"Dad\" off on his wife!", "[removed]", "But dad had to drive, all son had to do was play the game ( sarcasm)", "Exactly, he wants the stepson to get into sports so his dad will quit with all the adventures every couple weeks.", "I don't think we need a tape to see who wins that contest", "THIS!! Never once did he mention what they do with Stepson on THEIR weekends with him! He just bitched about what stepson's dad does with him on Dad's weekends, and said shit about what they do with his kids!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I see no reason a father wouldn't be willing to give falling asleep at the wheel with his kid in the car a shot if it meant having fun bowling.", "I feel the pain I had to endure every single Friday night and Saturday morning in August, September and October! My older brother football games on Fridays and my younger brother's football games on Saturday. \nOMG, SO SO SO BORING!"]}
