The building has 4 floors with two apartments on each floor. I happen to live on the first floor and for some reason, everyone chooses the first floor to come and smoke their weed. Personally I never had an issue with weed because I used to smoke myself but when I had my daughter it began to be an issue. \n\nHer bedroom is directly across from the front door to my apartment so whenever they decide to smoke weed in the halls it goes directly to her bedroom. She also has asthma so there have been times that I have to remove my daughter from her room while she's playing because their smoking and her room reeks of weed. Each time I see someone in the halls smoking, I explain the situation and they apologize and go outside. It is only ever the neighbors from one apartment that continue doing it and that are a huge problem for me. \n\nI've had numerous discussions with this specific neighbor and he'll stop for a little and then he continues. I've even tried to compromise and asked him to just smoke with the building door open so we smell it less. At times he'll do just that, but a lot of the times he will keep the door shut and smoke even closer to my door now (on the stairs leading up to my apartment). To make matters worse, he always has at LEAST two or three others with him. They will literally have the entire hallway full of smoke and not air it out until confronted. I have to remind him often and it's frustrating because now it just feels like blatant disrespect and disregard for my child. \n\nToday he did it again and I went out and addressed him respectfully. He responded with \"I don't have time for this, you can go. You don't say this to anyone else\" ( My husband asks everyone he sees not to smoke in the hallways and they apologize and move). I was livid and I lost my cool. We began shouting at one another and it was extremely loud. His sister comes running down the stairs to defend him and it almost came to blows (because of her). I explained to her what was going on when he walked away and she seemed to understand at first. Ultimately, she walks up the stairs with him and says verbatim \"He obviously doesn't give a F about what you're asking so we're gonna keep smoking.\" I threatened to call police and the landlord and she responded with \"go ahead.\" \n\nThey did come back in the hallways 15 mins later to smoke again but this time they kept the door open. They also kept it open while smoking hours after that. \n\nAm I the asshole? How should I handle this now?
