My wife was like this with our kids. She felt like she was entitled to tell them when it was her time to do things with them. She didn't treat them like adults even when they were living on their own. Your parents feel entitled to decide when you will do things. They still see you as their little boy who needs to live by their rules. You need to stop this behavior by setting your boundaries now or you will forever be it their beck and call even when you are married and living on your own.", "NTA, this is a nice compromise.
