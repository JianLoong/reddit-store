One of my bets mates married my little sister. They met at my wedding. Couldn\u2019t be happier for them, and it makes family gatherings much more fun having a good mate there to get loose with.", "NTA your sister is wrong, it is not your fault. You never needed to apologise all those years ago and because you did it, was easy for him to lay blame at your door and not see that he is in the wrong. He could of had his friend as family instead he rejected you both. He needs therapy. He was jealous and that jealousy has turned to rot.", "I think the consensus here is your brother is gay and was in love with your husband. He\u2019s the asshole for not getting over it", "NTA\n\nYour brother needs to get past this. It's been 8 *YEARS*. Time to let go of that grudge. Like, did your husband alter his relationship with your brother in any way when you started dating? Or did he continue to hang out with him and continue the long friendship they had?", "NTA\n\nYour brother has very serious and concerning issues, his reaction about you and his best friend dating (which you shouldn't have had to apologize for, ever) is completely absurd. Was he secretly in love with him? Because it truly is concerning how he hates you so much, that he refuses to meet your children and that he has to bring it up at your mother's birthday.\n\n\nTime to go 0 contact with him forever, he is extremely toxic.", "NTA\n\nMe suspects he was in love with his friend. And in his mind, his sister \"stole\" the love of his life from him, and that's why he's reacting so disproportionally.\n\nAs if it doesn't matter that his friend didn't feel the same way and is a straight dude. Your brother is still acting as if you guys did something akin to cheating by falling in love. Bro needs therapy.", "Nta what vile things to say especially around kids. I might understand him if you and his bff just boned a couple times and one of you was torn up by it but come on you have been together for years now.", "WTH is wrong with your brother? Betrayal? Your brother needs to be told that he needs therapy because he definitely needs it. You were not wrong with saying what you said and kicking him out.", "NTA, but i am in an similar situation, and I feel for you", "Your brother is gay. That is too bad about the closet. He should just admit it, he would be so much happier and maybe even find a good guy. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou can't control what your brother or that one sister think. You've got nothing to apologize for to either of them.\n\nYou did try hard to make the day nice for your mom. I'm sure that brother's comments were hurtful for her to hear. I hope she is OK with you asking him to leave. If you feel she needs it, you can apologize to her 'any missteps' you made that day. That's more about just giving her peace at this time. I hope she does understand that it's your brother who is creating the problem.", "NTA- I would be ecstatic to have my best friend marrying to my family. I would have them with me for life. Your brother is very weird.", "Your brother is gay and hates the fact you \"stole\" his man.", "INFO - what are the odds your brother is in love with your husband? my mind says almost certain.", "NTA - Either your brother was crushing hard for his BF or there is some other thing going on here", "Oh, your poor mother!  She was so happy with the album and then he ruined it for her. Absolutely NTA. Brother and sister are AH. I would go NC with both of them.", "Isn't dating someone a choice? You could have right at the beginning have chosen not to have pursued the relationship with his best friend before it became \"love\". But yes he's being an ass.", "> NTA.  Is your brother in love with his former best friend?\n\nStocking up on building materials and art supplies as we speak\u2026", "Either brother is in love with former best friend or with sister. No other explanation. NTA, OP. And you should tell him that in your next encounter, if he does the same!", "I hope it's the best friend and not her.", "NTA, completely agree with Ferromancer.  He's not like that because of you, he's like that because of himself.  And your sister is an idiot", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They started dating at 25 and 20 which is totally normal according to the post.", "It's weird that i have to scroll this far down to see exactly what I think the brothers problem is. The husband probably groomed the wife when she was a kid. The brother views the husband as a pervert. It's not about the brother losing a friend, it's purely about the age difference and how long he thinks the best friend harboured feelings toward his kid sister. \n\nIf that's not it, then the brother is just unhinged lol", "I don't think so, if they have been friends since babies. Op at 12 and the husband was what 18?.. the brother probably feels his so called friend may have been grooming the sister. Infact Op should have been like a kid sister to the best friends. I guess brother is disgusted and wonders what he missed growing up.", "This is different, when Op husband and bro where 18, Op was a preteen. Could there have been grooming. She should have been like a kid sister to husband.", "Is there a time limit to having kids?", "I agree, grooming maybe and brother missed the signs. There is an age gap that should make bro angry.", "Two years later we were already married and in a stable relationship, that's why we decided to have our first child, and sorry I didn't know that there is a perfect time to start having children lol", "I think op may have been groomed. Husband should see her as a kid sister. He has been best friends with bro since babies and op was a preteen when hubby and bro became adults. Brother maybe disgusted and wonder what signs he missed. But they are married with kids so maybe he should get over it. It's been a long to me", "What are the odds Op was groomed?", "Even if OP took all of best friend\u2019s time and attention (as a new girlfriend tends to do), they ended up becoming brothers in law, hence family, which I would consider even better than friends- just think of all the opportunities they would have to spend time together; and that\u2019s not including the extra boys\u2019 nights out or the \u201cjust stopping by to return your (insert appropriate power tool).\u201d There is definitely something wrong/suspicious to be holding on to this much hate for such a long time.", "Known her all her life", "Makes you wonder if the sister is aware of something no one else is (like brother maybe having feelings for his best friend!).", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Why else would he be so mad at you?", "Men can have very strange reactions when their best friend and siblings get together. It's not unusual. That being said, he's acting more like a jalous \"still in love\" ex rather than a pissed off brother. \n\nEither you're not talking about the full relation you had before it, or your brother really HATES you. For being together. Even if he disapproves, hates is too much.", "Exactly. My bet is the brother and boyfriend used to hook up honestly.", "That\u2019s a bit far fetched I think.", "Done the right way? Nothing. \n\nIf it's if they go behind your back, try to hide it and sneak it from you but that's just me. I've had one of my friends tell me \"Hey man, me and your sister have been playing a fair bit of Halo together, I think she's chill, would you mind if I take her out? Just asking as a courtesy\" to which I reply, \"Of course brother, thanks for being a man and not just snaking me, good luck!\" and that's that.", "I don\u2019t understand getting pissed at all. Why would you be unhappy that two people you love and presumably think are awesome have gotten together?", "Agreed. I was a bit annoyed when my friend dated my brother in school. It never went anywhere, but I got over it pretty quick and to hold onto this level of anger for so long (especially married with kids) is plain weird. Something else must be going on. NTA.", "Especially since it was not like his best friend had a casual relationship with his sister and then dumped her. They got married and had kids, FFS.", "But why do they need YOUR permission? And if you say no, why do they need to respect that?", "NTA - it\u2019s so strange. Was he in love with your husband? Did he think you needed to ask permission?", "I mean I understand if it's just a sexual hook up but if they are full on in love and get married that's a win. My mate Ron Weasley went through this and he said it was way better than if Ginny had married some total git like Malfoy! Now his best friend is really his brother in law rather than just an honoury brother.", "Because they're your buddy and you brought him over to see you, not sleep with your sister and the likely outcome is your buddy sleeps with her a few times and then a breakup occurs within a short period and it completely changes your relationship with your friend. It's a different story when your friend becomes your brother in law or they are together for years.", "20 yr old women are quite capable of making good decisions about relationships (yes they make bad decisions to, because we all do), and 26 does not put someone in the predator category (1/2 your age plus 7 is a good age gap rule).  I genuinely don't get why you'd be pissed at your mate", "predator?\n\n26 and 20 is fine. What's wrong with a 26 year old dating a 20 year old? Predator is a pretty major stretch...\n\nI would understand it if he was just trying to use her for sex or something vile like that, but if it's an actual relationship and they care about each other, what's the big deal?", "The first line her brother used so he could start his big old dramatic hissy fit was \"what a nice picture, no one would suspect that you would fuck my little sister a few years later\". He used possessive terms regarding his sister, not his former friend.\n\nIf it were the other way around, he'd have used possessive terms about OP's husband.", "I mean, the same awkward consequences can occur when two of your close mutual friends get together. No one thinks it\u2019s okay to get mad when that happens, though.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of the age gap per se, but because they knew each other their whole life. OP says they\u2019ve known each other since they were babies. When the brother graduated from high school, OP would\u2019ve been in like first or second year of middle. That would\u2019ve been weird to me. One of my sisters is 6 years younger than me and the thought of dating one of her friends, who I\u2019ve also seen grow up, creeps me out. I\u2019m not judging their situation or saying it\u2019s unhealthy (sometimes you barely know your sibling\u2019s friends, I don\u2019t know these people personally!), but I get how that could be a situation the brother wouldn\u2019t like.\n\nTHAT SAID, nothing about his behavior suggests that. He\u2019s hates the SISTER, and if you think your sibling is in a bad relationship this is literally the opposite of what you should do. While I see why someone could be creeped out in the situation, that\u2019s definitely not the case here.", "I think too many people are squeamish these days", "When your young like that, approximating like that doesn\u2019t really hold up tbh. Because that means that I, at 23 could date an 18 yo, someone fresh out of high school. No thanks.", "Half your age plus 7 holds up 26 and 20.", "The phrasing could also indicate that he\u2019s pissed at the friend for not rebuffing his sister\u2019s attempt to steal him away.", "I mean the same consequences could happen if his friend banged his widowed mom too. Wouldn't be ok to get mad about that either right? Same as mutual friends getting together lol."]}
