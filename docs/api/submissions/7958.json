I apologized thousands of times for falling in love with his best friend and for not having been able to fall in love with someone else, but he never forgave me. We only see each other at family parties and that's it, he didn't attend our wedding and didn't want to meet our children (6F, 4F, 2F) when they were born either so you can imagine how much he hates me. \n\nA few days ago we celebrated our mom's (62F) birthday at my house because hers was being renovated. Well, my mom begged him to come because she is sick and she doesn't know if she will be able to celebrate her birthday with us next year, and he accepted her invitation and went to my house. Of course, since he arrived, he made it clear that he was only there for our mom and that he was not interested in playing happy family with me or my kids. I kept quiet because I wanted my mom to have a good day and ignored him.\n\nAfter cutting the cake my mom opened her gifts, and one of those gifts was an album of the most important moments of all her children and grandchildren (something that for some reason she asked for a few months ago) And she was so happy with the album that she started looking at all the photos and showing them to the guests while remembering when she took each photo of us, her children.\n\nIn that album there were photos of my brother with my husband at their high school graduation (my husband was included because he and my brother have been friends since they were babies so he is like another son to her) and when my brother saw them he said something like \"what a nice picture, no one would suspect that you would fuck my little sister a few years later\", my sister (31F) told him to shut up that he was being rude but he didn't stop and kept looking at the photos to say things that nobody wanted to hear, so I got tired and asked him to leave my house, I told him that he was being rude and inconsiderate with our mother, that I didn't want him there. And of course he stormed off and now he thinks that the villain of the movie is me. And the worst thing is that one of our sisters (36F) thinks the same thing, because she thinks that I should have kept quiet since it's my fault that he's like that. AITA?\n\nedit: I don't know if my brother is gay, but the truth is that I suspected it many times when I saw how affectionate he was with my husband. Like, my husband had a few girlfriends before me and my brother hated all of them, but I thought it was just jealousy because he didn't spend as much time with him. But if I think about it, it does look weird, he's in his thirties and he only had a girlfriend when he was twelve or thirteen, he was always possessive of my husband and overly affectionate, which my husband always hated, so maybe it's true, maybe that's why he hates me and my kids and maybe that's why I unconsciously apologized to him, because deep down I knew he was in love with him too idk", "created_utc": 1674364349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ibqum/aita_for_yelling_at_my_brother_and_kicking_him/", "score": 1062, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jealousy makes a lot of sense", "Because let's say he was upset about less time with one of you: after 8 years, a typical person would be over it by now and have grown to accept it as part of life and love.\n\nIf he was mad because he thought his best friend was being a predator, he would be mad at him, not you.\n\nAnd what he said about the photograph sounds possessive of you... but it really feels to me like his point is 'you betrayed me by getting together with my sister'.\n\nIf you swap his gender to female, it seems even more obvious to me. He was the clingy over affectionate best friend to your husband that was in love with him but your husband didn't love him back or consider him an option.\n\nHe needs to sort out his feelings though, it isn't your fault he started making passive aggressive jabs and kicking off at your mother's birthday, that was a choice that HE made.\n\nAnd he doesn't have to specifically be gay, he could be bi or pan, but regardless, he is acting like a jealous ex-lover that his love interest loves someone else and like his soul mate was stolen away from him.\n\nWhen it sounds like your husband was never anything except straight or at the very least, your brother was never his type or of interest to him like that.", "> Plus his mother is sick and this might be the last time to get everyone together with her and he couldn't eve let her have this.\n\nThis is key. Regardless of his feelings, past or present, ~~for the husband~~ it doesn't cost him anything to keep his mouth shut on a day that is to celebrate his mother.", "Yeah, tbh either way it shows a huge sense of arrogance. As a bisexual person I fell in love with my school best friend and tbh it was a scary and heartbreaking experience. But when she got into her first relationship I was sad but happy for her? Because I loved her?? This man\u2019s behaviour is very odd and entitled and controlling, and talk about cutting your nose off to spite your face! He\u2019s lost his best friend and his little sister! I can\u2019t imagine keeping up such a silly grudge for 8 years!", "This is the part I feel like a lot of people are missing. I had the same \u201cwait a minute\u2026\u201d moment when I saw the ages. I don\u2019t wanna jump the gun but I\u2019m gonna be honest if I was in the brothers shoes I\u2019d be a bit weirded out too. The 8 year grudge though is crazy. Especially in such a strong passive aggressive way. Why not just say what the hell the issue is?", "She was 20 when they got together. She is 28, been together 8 years. 8+20=28.", "This is one of the reasons why Reddit has turned into an absolute shit heap of a platform, I don't mind the opposing views but what I do mind is when people only read what they want to read and they don't read the actual comment at hand. \n\nI'm going to reply this and then block you because you seem mentally deficient. My sister never went behind my back, my friend did, a male. He did not come to me before hand and speak to me about it like a man, this is where the issue of OP's situation and my issue came into play, it's not the fact that they wanted to date my sister for example, it's the betrayal factor, the lack of respect. \n\nNo one is saying anything about knowing the ins and outs of my sisters sexual endeavors to be that involved in her life, you weird fucking little man, but hey, read what you want to read and welcome to my block list, you sadistic little boy.", "Not necessarily. My childhood bff had a lot of sisters, I believe the age range between him and them was 0-12 years (0 was his twin sister), I never saw any of them and didnt see them as kid sisters or whatever.", "You k mila kunis and Ashton krutcher are married now but did act together when she was 14 and he 19? Do you think he groomed her?", "Appropriate power tool implies the existence of sharing an inappropriate power tool.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking- they had a relationship or \u201cexperimented\u201d with one another .", "So he waited till the kid he knew as a baby reached an older age. Gross! He was like her big bro too, knew her as a baby, child and everything..but I guess big bro should let it go already, the deed is done and they are a family.", "do you live in a country where women need a male guardian?", "But these ones were friends from babies, so parents knew each other and definitely family friends. So different from a friend you made in school. I wonder is best friend told bro he likes his sister or it was hidden. Who sought who out is conveniently missing. I feel the anger comes from how the relationship developed but op hasn't mentioned it so who know. Bro should get over it. The deed is done", "5 yrs differences and strangers , not ur brothers best friend since they were babies , who was there when you were born and should be like a big brother too. I wonder what the true story of how they got together happened. Was it done behind big bros back.  Something ain't right here. Just a gut feeling.", "[removed]", "Hehe- those are saved for the really tough jobs!", "My dad is apparently a predator for marrying my 20-year-old mother when he was 26. Never realised. Thanks. Good to know. \n\nSeriously?! A grown adult is capable and allowed to think for themselves. Brother is just pissed his friend liked his sister more.\n\nNTA", "right like idk having your childhood best friend become your brother in law sounds cool as fuck", "I get that you probably don't have a lot of close friends but normally if you're close with your boys, they wouldn't just snake you behind your back and start dating your sister out of the fucking blue, they would approach you first and hit you up about the situation. \n\nIt's not about needing permission, it's about respect. Maybe you don't respect your friends enough to do so? It's not really a hard concept to grasp my guy.\n\nEdit: https://old.reddit.com/user/Zestyclose_Public_47 I see you arguing with a lot of other people over the same point, just face facts dawg, you're wrong about this situation and just because you'd let your boys run a train on a family member and you'd be fine with the lack of respect from your peers, your boys, your homies it doesn't mean everyone else needs to be. \n\nGrow up.", "Seriously, after 8 years....", "Bad bot! You stole this comment from Alien_lifeform_666!", "Ross also went through this, and was able to embrace the new relationship dynamics,  staying a good brother and friend.\n\nI think op's was in love with his best friend, but they weren't together, he never even declared his feelings, he is an A H for holding up to his obsession.", "It would probably depend on the friend to be honest. I think most of the friends I had at 26 I would not have been ok with them dating my 20 year old sister, but that's because they were a bunch of fuck boys. I'm sure I'd be over it once it was clear it was serious.", "Nothing is wrong. People on reddit judge relationships based on age gap only and treat girls at their 20s like children.", "Yeah your mate fucking your sister and just using her is not cool. But your brother in law being your best friend is an absolute win.", "I don't disagree that that is a possibility but if he's still in the closet with his family he might have gotten used to making sure not to say things that indicated he is jealous of his sister being with the man he was(/is?) in love with.", "Guess my husband and I should get divorced. Whoops.", "You might be a bit pissed at first but 3 kids and 8 years later you get over it. Unless you also want to bang hubby and act like a psychotic, jealous teenager.", "Yes I'm afraid that's clearly the only outcome visible from my flippant and not at all binding anonymous post on the internet."]}
