I apologized thousands of times for falling in love with his best friend and for not having been able to fall in love with someone else, but he never forgave me. We only see each other at family parties and that's it, he didn't attend our wedding and didn't want to meet our children (6F, 4F, 2F) when they were born either so you can imagine how much he hates me. \n\nA few days ago we celebrated our mom's (62F) birthday at my house because hers was being renovated. Well, my mom begged him to come because she is sick and she doesn't know if she will be able to celebrate her birthday with us next year, and he accepted her invitation and went to my house. Of course, since he arrived, he made it clear that he was only there for our mom and that he was not interested in playing happy family with me or my kids. I kept quiet because I wanted my mom to have a good day and ignored him.\n\nAfter cutting the cake my mom opened her gifts, and one of those gifts was an album of the most important moments of all her children and grandchildren (something that for some reason she asked for a few months ago) And she was so happy with the album that she started looking at all the photos and showing them to the guests while remembering when she took each photo of us, her children.\n\nIn that album there were photos of my brother with my husband at their high school graduation (my husband was included because he and my brother have been friends since they were babies so he is like another son to her) and when my brother saw them he said something like \"what a nice picture, no one would suspect that you would fuck my little sister a few years later\", my sister (31F) told him to shut up that he was being rude but he didn't stop and kept looking at the photos to say things that nobody wanted to hear, so I got tired and asked him to leave my house, I told him that he was being rude and inconsiderate with our mother, that I didn't want him there. And of course he stormed off and now he thinks that the villain of the movie is me. And the worst thing is that one of our sisters (36F) thinks the same thing, because she thinks that I should have kept quiet since it's my fault that he's like that. AITA?\n\nedit: I don't know if my brother is gay, but the truth is that I suspected it many times when I saw how affectionate he was with my husband. Like, my husband had a few girlfriends before me and my brother hated all of them, but I thought it was just jealousy because he didn't spend as much time with him. But if I think about it, it does look weird, he's in his thirties and he only had a girlfriend when he was twelve or thirteen, he was always possessive of my husband and overly affectionate, which my husband always hated, so maybe it's true, maybe that's why he hates me and my kids and maybe that's why I unconsciously apologized to him, because deep down I knew he was in love with him too idk", "created_utc": 1674364349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ibqum/aita_for_yelling_at_my_brother_and_kicking_him/", "score": 2070, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But they got married!", "[removed]", "*clutches pearl* oh my, I didn\u2019t even think of that being a possibility", "I cried too!", "> The most magical moments we have in life is the time we spend with family and friend.\n\nHe missed out on the chance to do both at the same time. I'd be thrilled if my brother in law was my best friend. It gets harder to make time to friends as people get married and have kids. But if your best friend marries into the family then you can see them way more than you probably would otherwise. \n\nJealousy is such a tragic thing.", "Well, depending on the family lottery... Ain't always peaches and cream.\nTime with family for the minority of us can be hell.\nHappily we can choose a new family once we're mature enough.", "[removed]", "Right, on another thread I said everyone dated each other\u2019s siblings in high school and no one cared. I\u2019d love it if my bestie became my SIL. But since she\u2019s gay, and married, it\u2019s not gonna happen!", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/mebysical \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ibqum/aita_for_yelling_at_my_brother_and_kicking_him/j5dlvu8/\n\nBot Reported.", "I could understand that if there was manipulation or harm going on. After all these years and 3 kids, it would seem that there is love and stability to the union though.", "Yeah 26 and 20 does not qualify as Predator.\n\n36 and 20? Now you might have a case.", "Seriously? Your sister is not a minor. She is an adult woman capable of making her own decisions. If my sister decided to date one of my close friends, I would be head over heels. I would love to have my friends as a part of my family. Also, a age difference of 6 years is like nothing at that age.", "Oh wow yo u seem to keep good company... If i wouldn't deem a friend worthy of dating my family members or friends, i wouldn't spend time with them...", "The weird thing about this is that OP's brother seems to be upset at OP herself though? At least, based on her wording. I do wish he'd be upfront about it if that's the issue in his eyes, because it is a pretty serious thing and it doesn't help to be this vague about it", "Funnily enough, I think Ron was always rooting for Harry/Ginny but Harry just assumed he'd be furious lol.", "Well, your best friend is supposed to be your person. You are stuck with your family, but you choose your friends. And you tell them your secrets and your actual feelings about family and friends. So, to find out that your friend is messing with your family is a betrayal for some. But, this seems extreme. I can understand being chilly, but not irrational like this.", "26 and 20 are, with maybe a few exceptions, very different life stages. What does a 26 year old need from a just-passed teenager that he can\u2019t get from someone his age? Why can\u2019t he find someone closer to his age? It\u2019s very sus behaviour at the least, there\u2019s an imbalance in life & relationship experience. It\u2019s not a universal rule but I am yet to meet a 26 year old man who dates 20 year olds who wasn\u2019t a total creep or outright abuser. Especially ones who date 20 year olds they\u2019ve known for years.\n\nThat being said, don\u2019t think that excuses the brothers reaction at all. Your only options in a scenario like this are to support & inform. You don\u2019t push her away if you think she\u2019s been groomed, you stick by her. So I\u2019m unsure if this is his reasoning. Seems like something else going on.", "\u2026people here are stating that the age gap you\u2019re talking about is appropriate.  A good guideline is half your age plus 7.  So a 26yo and a 20yo fit in that general guideline.", "My aunt's husband was her older brother's best friend (like two years older). My uncle was best man at their wedding (my aunt'shusband was also his best man when he married).  They all stayed friendly their whole lives.", "\"Most people rejected his message, for he spoke the truth.\"\n\nI love the \"They're consenting adults!\" takes. Like yes, I as a family member don't have a say in who they date. But you don't just do that shit behind their back. You let them know that you're interested and regardless of what you think, what happens happens, but its such a betrayal. You don't do that shit behind your \"best friend's\" back.", "I agree.", "I mean, your personal preference doesn't really matter. That relationship is legal and not predatory, as long as it didn't begin before 18 (although in some US states, 16/17 is actually the legal age). I can understand not wanting to date that young, but I can also understand relationships that do start out that way. It really depends on the people.", "I have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nUnless one of them is handicapped in some way and unable to make their own choices - There's literally 0 issues with a 20 year old being with a 26 year old.\n\nIt's purely down to the individual, if they both find each other attractive and their personalities match/respect and treat each other properly - Then there's nothing wrong with it.", "That\u2019s only weird because of how it changes generational/power dynamics. It\u2019s a bit like the difference between your friend dating your co-worker and your friend dating your boss, greatly amplified.\n\nAnd awkward as it would be, I still don\u2019t get getting *mad* about it.", "I mean, that\u2019s like your opinion, man. It\u2019s fully legal but it\u2019s definitely been my overwhelming experience that if you take a sample of the types of men who date 20 year olds at 26 instead of someone their own age, you will find way above average rates of groomers and abusers, because there\u2019s a *reason* they\u2019re not dating someone their own age - either because of immaturity or because women more experienced with assholes see through their charade easier than someone who\u2019s likely not had a serious relationship yet. \n\nHe was 20 when she was 14, that\u2019s a weird ass dynamic and he likely knew her then too depending on the friendship. Defend it all you like, that\u2019s your prerogative, but it\u2019s a weird hill to die on.", "No, Not really a hill to die on - I think you put too much thought into it and you think 20 - 26 is a much bigger age range than it is.\n\nAs someone pushing 40, excluding subjective experience, I don't think experience difference between 20-26 is that drastic."]}
