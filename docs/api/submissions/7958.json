I apologized thousands of times for falling in love with his best friend and for not having been able to fall in love with someone else, but he never forgave me. We only see each other at family parties and that's it, he didn't attend our wedding and didn't want to meet our children (6F, 4F, 2F) when they were born either so you can imagine how much he hates me. \n\nA few days ago we celebrated our mom's (62F) birthday at my house because hers was being renovated. Well, my mom begged him to come because she is sick and she doesn't know if she will be able to celebrate her birthday with us next year, and he accepted her invitation and went to my house. Of course, since he arrived, he made it clear that he was only there for our mom and that he was not interested in playing happy family with me or my kids. I kept quiet because I wanted my mom to have a good day and ignored him.\n\nAfter cutting the cake my mom opened her gifts, and one of those gifts was an album of the most important moments of all her children and grandchildren (something that for some reason she asked for a few months ago) And she was so happy with the album that she started looking at all the photos and showing them to the guests while remembering when she took each photo of us, her children.\n\nIn that album there were photos of my brother with my husband at their high school graduation (my husband was included because he and my brother have been friends since they were babies so he is like another son to her) and when my brother saw them he said something like \"what a nice picture, no one would suspect that you would fuck my little sister a few years later\", my sister (31F) told him to shut up that he was being rude but he didn't stop and kept looking at the photos to say things that nobody wanted to hear, so I got tired and asked him to leave my house, I told him that he was being rude and inconsiderate with our mother, that I didn't want him there. And of course he stormed off and now he thinks that the villain of the movie is me. And the worst thing is that one of our sisters (36F) thinks the same thing, because she thinks that I should have kept quiet since it's my fault that he's like that. AITA?\n\nedit: I don't know if my brother is gay, but the truth is that I suspected it many times when I saw how affectionate he was with my husband. Like, my husband had a few girlfriends before me and my brother hated all of them, but I thought it was just jealousy because he didn't spend as much time with him. But if I think about it, it does look weird, he's in his thirties and he only had a girlfriend when he was twelve or thirteen, he was always possessive of my husband and overly affectionate, which my husband always hated, so maybe it's true, maybe that's why he hates me and my kids and maybe that's why I unconsciously apologized to him, because deep down I knew he was in love with him too idk\n\nedit 2: I spoke to my husband and he says that nothing ever happened between them that they were just friends, that he is straight and that my brother always knew it, that he never did or said anything to make him think otherwise, so I don't know what's wrong with him. I just know that I feel enormous guilt, if he's in love with him I'll never be able to feel at peace again.", "created_utc": 1674364349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ibqum/aita_for_yelling_at_my_brother_and_kicking_him/", "score": 5114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Saying one or both of us are bi when he started seeing your brother romantically but the brother's love was a smothering kind of love, so he chose the female version of the same gene pool and is now living happily ever after would result a nuclear implosion of his happy little family.\n\nNow, all your husband can do is play dumb and all your brother can do is take snipes in passing. I think it's time to have an in-depth conversation with your husband. Let him know what you accept him even if he's bi and has been in an actual relationship with your brother when he was young. Find a way for the two of you to dialogue with your brother about the true wound instead of the one the two of them are pretending is the wound. Apologize for getting involved with his lover and remind him you never would have allowed things to go that far if you knew they were together.
