Congratulations on the baby.  You were respectful of your brother / SIL's feelings when timing your announcement.  She also politely excused herself to avoid becoming emotional and ruining your announcement.  It was a difficult situation.  It sounds like they are happy for you and sad for themselves at the same time.  It is possible to have conflicting emotions.", "NTA - You're allowed to be happy for your pregnancy and want to talk about it. It's not your fault that they are having issues having a kid.", "NAH - just an unfortunate situation. You should be allowed to break the news to your family about something exciting that is happening to you. It's an important life event that shouldn't be done over text message IMO.\n\nThey should also be allowed to feel heartbroken and cry that they desperately wish they could have a biological child and they are seeing everyone else around them living their dream. Feelings happen. I don't doubt that they are happy for you. They are just hurting and don't find that \"rude\" at all. Just unfortunate.\n\nCongrats on the baby, by the way!!", "NAH. This was going to hurt no matter how you said it, but you had to say it eventually. I don't think you're an AH for doing it the way you did, this doesn't sound malicious or like you wanted to rub it in their faces. You knew it was a touchy subject and handled it as delicately as you could. Unfortunately, I think this was going to upset your brother and his partner regardless. And I don't think they're necessarily AHs for feeling the way they do. It hurts when you struggle to achieve something and someone achieves it before you. Give them time and space to process their feelings. The only person I'd deem an AH would be dad for calling them selfish. It's not selfish to feel things and be unable to contain those feelings. It's a human reaction.", "NTA.  I struggled to get pregnant, but I was always quick to congratulate others and accept that I could be happy for them and sad for me.  Fertility issues are *hard* but the world doesn\u2019t stop turning for anyone else.  I\u2019m sorry your news didn\u2019t get properly celebrated, OP.", "Soft YTA. You should have told your brother and his partner in a way they could process their feelings in private. They can feel happy for you while also feeling absolutely fucking devastated about their struggles.\n\nWould have been better to tell the parents without bro and SO present and to tell your brother via email/text so that he and his partner could work through their complicated feelings in private rather than be put on the spot. \n\nThey aren't assholes for having feelings.\n\nYou aren't assholes for being excited.\n\nBut you are a bit assholes for being insensitive and putting them in the position of having to deal with their emotions in the middle of a family event.", "Situations like this are hard to navigate. NAH.", "Honestly, I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted to eternity for this, but I think everyone saying Y T A who have had infertility issues aren\u2019t being truly unbiased in this situation. \n\nThis is clearly NAH IMO. **Could** you have given your brother and his gf a heads up about your pregnancy? Yes. Are you obligated to? No. Does it make you an AH not to give them a heads up? **Absolutely not.** Your pregnancy announcement is your news to share to whom and when you want, (barring stealing a loved one\u2019s thunder.) \n\nI\u2019m so tired of people talking about \u201csomeone\u2019s weekend\u201d as if \u201ca day\u201d isn\u2019t enough to give to someone when celebrating a special occasion. It\u2019s exhausting. We\u2019re creating societies of people who think they\u2019re princes and princesses whenever they have a life achievement, celebration, or something as small as a bachelor\u2019s party, which isn\u2019t even the main celebrating event. I know this is going to shock people, but on any given \u201cspecial day,\u201d thousands of other people are also celebrating, having \u201cspecial days,\u201d or have something going on that doesn\u2019t revolve around other \u201cspecial day\u201d celebrants. I agree - OP shouldn\u2019t show up to his brother\u2019s wedding and announce his pregnancy, but I can\u2019t imagine a more appropriate setting than **literal Mother\u2019s Day** to share this wonderful news. \n\nAnd yes - I\u2019m not blaming OP\u2019s brother\u2019s gf for having feelings. I\u2019ve had my own pregnancy struggles and it is normal and natural to have complicated emotions when you\u2019re struggling with wanting to have a baby so badly and either failing to get pregnant or having miscarriage after miscarriage. She did the appropriate thing when she realized she couldn\u2019t separate her sorrowful feelings from someone else\u2019s joy and left the room. \n\nThat said, the real AHs here are the people insisting that OP is an AH for not telling his brother\u2019s gf their special news before their own parents. Let me spin this a slightly different way. I\u2019ve also had my share of health issues. During one of these crises, I told people about my health problem as I felt ready, when the moment felt right, and based on who I felt would give me what I needed most. I had people I genuinely love interrogate me on who already knew and then chastise me and tell me they couldn\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t tell them before other individuals, or demand that they should have been the *first* to know. My private business had turned into a pissing contest for how well I considered other people\u2019s feelings. Sharing pregnancy information is honestly no different. Nobody is an AH for not telling someone about a pregnancy regardless of how it impacts the person hearing the news. It\u2019s truly sad that OP\u2019s brother\u2019s gf is struggling to get pregnant. I empathize. It still isn\u2019t OP\u2019s responsibility or ethical obligation to pander to her feelings to the point of sharing pregnancy news with someone so unconnected with OP in order to \u201cspare her feelings\u201d and \u201cgive her time to grieve.\u201d It\u2019s also not reasonable to expect OP to acknowledge an entire weekend of \u201cspecialness,\u201d especially over a bachelor\u2019s party. **NAH** and this is a hill I\u2019m willing to die on.", "NTA, guessing you are in the UK as you referenced Mother's Day.  It was the perfect time to tell your parents.  Your brother and his partner need to learn to deal with other couples announcing that they are expecting.  Pregnancies around the world do not end because they are having issues.  Their attitudes took away the joy for your parents.  Take them out to brunch next weekend and have a real celebration.", "NTA. \n\nYou can\u2019t not tell them, otherwise you\u2019ll have to hide the baby forever. \n\nInfertility sucks, but it\u2019s not your fault.\n\nCongratulations by the way! I\u2019m sorry your family couldn\u2019t act excited.", "NTA.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou were not intentionally cruel here, but this situation could 100% have been avoided with a little forethought on your part. \n\nWhen I was going through my fifth failed IVF and my sister got pregnant, she pulled me aside to tell me in private before she announced to everybody. She knew I would have emotions about it and wanted me to be able to process them in private, which was hugely kind of her.\n\nThen I was able to grieve on me own, move on, be happy for her, throw her a shower, etc. Without the humiliation of a public reveal where I had to feel my feelings in front of everybody.\n\nIt would have been kinder to give her a heads up before announcing. Mother's day is already a difficult day for infertile women and you just compounded her grief. I just think that had you thought about how your sister was going to feel, you could have easily sidestepped this situation with grace.", "I don\u2019t think this news was going to necessarily go over well no matter how you presented it. You had to tell them. NTA. And congratulations!", "NAH. You could have done it better. You should have spoken to your brother and his partner privately. But you're not wrong to be excited and they aren't wrong to be hurt", "NAH\n\nIt is so hard to know how to handle these types of situations, and everyone reacts differently. It seems like you tried your best to be respectful, and your brother and SIL tried to manage their reactions appropriately. \n\nPersonally, I think the best way to handle this situation would be to speak to your parents first. Give them the news and allow yourself to be excited with them, without guilt. Then tell them that you would appreciate them keeping the news to themselves until you speak to your brother privately. Don't wait too long to avoid an accidental slip. Then, you speak to your brother privately, just the two of you. Allow him to inform his wife and them to react privately without judgment. IMO, this is the most cautious way to handle it. There is really no good way to tell someone that you are easily getting something they have hoped for, so unless you're rubbing it in their faces, you handled it ok.", "Nta your allowed to be happy be pregnant and you have to tell them sometime. It not your fault they can't be grown up enough to be happy for you. I can have kids but my brother announced his pregnancy lately I would never be upset that I'm getting a new niece it suck but that life your dad right there the ones int he  wrong", "NAH but you should have announced privately to your parents so they could be super excited and privately to your brothers and SIL so it could be gentle and in a safe space for them.\nYou are allowed to be excited and shouldn't be hiding. Your brother is going to need to get used to this as there are going to be tons of events for and about the baby.", "NTA\u2026.. why the fuck do people make it awkward for the people who CAN conceive and cater to those who can\u2019t? I understand being sad or disappointed but once someone struggles with fertility in a family it\u2019s like a dark cloud that hangs and takes away from the joy and blessings that the other children born into the family truly are. Congratulations and you have nothing to be sorry for.", "Not the asshole. Yes you guys are pregnant and it obviously hurts that they can\u2019t get pregnant. But they should be happy for you nonetheless.", "NTA. Your child deserves all the love from your family.

Like it had to be that holiday of all days?\n\nI get that people don\u2019t have to cater, blah blah blah. But you could have given them a heads up beforehand so they could excuse themselves. A little empathy goes a long way.", "I\u2019ve seen a lot of these posts on here. I think in future for all people navigating a pregnancy announcement with a couple struggling with infertility: pull them aside and give them a heads-up ahead of time so they are able to navigate their feelings and decide to be a part of the big announcement. I think this is the best way. NAH.", "NTA. She needs therapy and learn how to control her emotions. She can't even be bothered to be happy for you and made it about her and her issues. Are their co workers, friends and the rest of the family supposed to tip toe around them for the rest of their lives?", "NTA \nthey would've known at some point that you were having a baby. you didn't do it to intentionally spite them or add insult to injury, it's up to you when you want to announce it, it's your baby afterall. \n\nhowever i don't think your brother and his wife are the assholes here either. it's understandable why they were hurt", "Soft YTA\n\nDid you really need to announce it the same weekend as your brother's stag? And on mother's day while you were all gathered with the family. That of all days, come on. You could have waited a week or given them some heads up.", "NTA Your joyous news should not be hidden like a dirty secret. It is fine to share such news with family. I am sorry your brother and his GF haven't been so lucky yet. People aren't going to stop having babies or hide pregnancies because someone is having problems conceiving. Nor should they hide their good news. I am sure they will run into many pregnant couples and babies in the future. It isn't feasible for everyone to pretend that it isn't good news or that it isn't happening.", "Why on earth would you not tell your brother privately first so he can tell his wife and they can brace themselves and deal with the feeling it stirs up?

I don't think it's the OP's fault this happened.

Yes, my sister knows, and isn't exactly the most empathetic, but I don't blame her for not being where I am. No one has the same journey. I can still be joyful that my sister and her husband have new additions to the family, and acknowledge that it is subdued by my own hardships. My parents are overjoyed to be grandparents, and I'm glad to see them with the kids. Someday it will be with my children.\n\nI think OP's family didn't know how to react, but that's no one's fault. She can speak with her sister and just make sure she's alright.", "This. Soft YTA.\n\nI myself dealt with years of infertility and did ivf. The correct way is to let them know before hand so they can privately process their emotions. Mother\u2019s Day is an extra sensitive time so that probably felt like salt in the wounds.", "Agreed! I got \u201clucky\u201d that my mom saw a Christmas photo of my brother and his girlfriend of 2 months that had a onesie in it, so I had a heads up beforehand. Otherwise there\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve faked being \u201chappy\u201d about it after a decade of infertility. A heads up is always the way to go", "Absolutely agree. Soft YTA. \nMy husband and I were trying actively for a child, 7 years of failed attempts. My brother and his wife conceived first try, I wasn\u2019t upset. I was very happy.  Then came their wedding ceremony (they had eloped when she was pregnant), and they announced in front of everyone they were expecting again.  Their fourth (he had adopted her two boys and they had one bio at the time.). My mom was furious and left the reception. I put on a happy smile and congratulated them. And cried on the five hour drive home.  Our sister was with me and helped me talk it out.  Some heads up would have been appreciated. \nAs someone that struggles with fertility, I don\u2019t expect the world to cater to my sensitivity, I have three mom friends pregnant now.  It sucks sometimes to be jealous. I am very happy for them\u2026 I just can\u2019t always control the tears. \n\nMy husband and I were blessed were our daughter after 8 years of trying.  We\u2019ve miscarried twice since then, 6 years ago and are still trying. Congratulations, OP. But I would still offer them an apology.", "Yup. Soft YTA. Mother's day is hard for people experiencing fertility issues, that combined with this announcement must have been gutting. All of that could've been made easier had you told your b brother in advance, so that he was aware and could decide if they wanted to come to dinner.", "Also a soft YTA for coming to the conclusion that a surprise baby announcement in front of the entire family *after* having conversations on how to break the news. It\u2019s not like they impulsively announced the pregnancy because they were so excited; they *considered* it and then decided this was the best way to break the news. Not sure what the thought process was there.", "Agree with this 100%. Announcing in front of everyone on Mother\u2019s Day seems like one of the worst ways to go if you say you realize that it\u2019s a touchy subject considering their fertility issues. I\u2019m going with YTA mainly because you didn\u2019t seem to really actually consider them even though you started off your post talking about it. Most people saying N T A don\u2019t realize how hard it is for infertile couples - her bursting into tears doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t happy for you - she is sad for herself and those two things can exist at the same time. However this doesn\u2019t make hearing the news easy as it is a reminder of how hard things are for them and how they may never get the thing they want the most and that is what upsets her so I\u2019m not going to fault her for her emotions about a very hard thing. Look, I know it\u2019s difficult for people that don\u2019t struggle with infertility to realize how to best deal with these situations - it\u2019s actually a huge learning curve for the majority of the population BUT if it was my family, I would google or even here on Reddit seek out the advice of how to best break pregnancy news in your situation - it takes almost no effort, most of the effort is having the consideration to think of it in the first place. It\u2019s the very least you can do because I hope you have empathy for your brother\u2019s situation and thank your lucky stars you never have to deal with a horrible thing like infertility. And for anyone reading, the best way to break the news is via text or email - something where they can process and respond in their own time. The best way to word the text is to begin by saying something acknowledging their hardship, announcing the news, and letting them know it\u2019s okay if they need time/distance and give them the lead on how much or how little they want to hear about the pregnancy.", "This. I don't even want kids, but life sucks enough as is and this seems to be the one silver lining and milestone you get in your work rat adult life, for people who do want them.\n\n Taking that away from the whole family cause of your personal problems is....a lot to ask.

If they are worried about whether or not she can actually conceive, though, I would suggest seeking a professional, medical opinion. Could save a lot if heartache in the long run, and if they can have kids but are having bad luck, a medical boost such as fertility treatment may be available.\n\nThe other thing I want to address is how they'd find out anyway. Surely, they'd eventually know, right? You cannot just hide your child from them until they are finally, successfully pregnant.

The only time an action like that should be taken is if someone has just had a miscarriage (I consider failed IVFs the same as miscarriage, so if that occurred around the same time a warning would be preferred). I think the brother & his wife were the ones that acted a smidge rudely in this scenario because what was supposed to be a happy announcement became a grey-hued moment due to their **immediate reactions**. I know many infertile women, myself included, where although they may be feeling an indescribable emptiness that likely won't be filled in the same way as someone who can get pregnant, they don't generally react in this manner unless someone is rubbing their fertility in their faces intentionally, **not through a normal family reveal.** (unless a miscarriage or failed medical procedure/assistance through pills has just been experienced)\n\nIt's ok for the brother & his wife to be feeling the depth of their sorrows, who wouldn't if they wanted to have kids & biologically are running into a wall constantly?

Sharing joy is done for everyone's sake, sharing in grief is often indulging the party most impacted. Putting the pregnancy in focus makes everyone happy, putting the infertility constantly in the line of vision makes everyone anxious and apprehensive as to not insult the impacted parties. \n\nAlmost like joy feels good and grief feels bad, and people like feeling good, eh?

I don\u2019t think that makes her \u201cselfish\u201d as your dad suggests. However, you are also entitled to share your joy while your family is gathered together.", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to be happy about your pregnancy. They are allowed to be sad about it. \nYour parents are probably very happy for you, but I understand that they don't want to hurt you brother and SIL by showing to n much happiness. I just think they don't realise that if SIL gets pregnant and they respond ecstatic they might make you and your girlfriend feel like your kid was not good enough or less wanted \n\nThis is just such a hard subject for a lot of people. The only way to navigate it is to not judge each other for feelings that are there. Respect each other enough to be open and honest about how you feel and do not take someone else's feelings as a judgement about yours. \n\nMaybe plan aan activity for you, your girlfriend, brother and SIL where you can also talk about how it makes everyone feel. Without judging each other. A hike with a picknick or an art workshop for just the four of you. Tell them how you feel and that you understand it is hard for them. Tell them you want them present in your child's life and how much that would mean to you. Tell them it's okay if they say they cannot handle certain things and that they are allowed to set boundaries (like not attending a baby shower if that is too painful)\nBut overall just talk. Let them know you are there for them.", "Nta.\n\nI say that as someone who was told they were infertile and had to live through many such announcements. One in particular when I was having fertility treatment and really cut deep.\n\nSadly, this is a them issue.\n\nThey will have to be able to learn that though they wish to have a baby it may take a while or never happen, but the rest of the world will continue to do so and it will feel like everyone is having a baby wherever they turn.\n\nI don't think that it was wrong to announce this way per se, as any announcement manner would have probably ended in the same way.\n\nI would suggest that you say no more directly to them, wait for the next family event, possibly Easter and carry on regardless. Not to hurt their feelings or not acknowledge them, but because you cannot change things and don't owe an apology etc, so now it's up to them to manage the situation. That nay mean they don't attend family occasions for a whole, but at some point in the next 6 months, the baby will hopefully arrive and they need to have their heads around this....", "As others have said. NAH. Except your dad. Your brother and his gif handled it perfectly reasonable.\n\nAnd yes. It probably would've been better to tell your brother before. But also that would be more a thing of extra courtesy rather than making you an asshole for not doing it. The two get to see babies and pregnant women all the time you and your partner aren't any different.\n\nThat being said. If you are close to your brother, invite him over for a beer and just talk about it and then watch a sports game or play some videogames or whatever.", "NTA - why do people who can't have children make such a fuss over it and cause it to overshadow their whole lives?  they are at a point in their lives when probably lots of friends / family are having children and this is far from the first such announcement they will hear.  They must have know it could happen. \n\nThey are getting married and you and your partner arn't weeping at the sight of a white dress.  As though nobody else can be happy except them and only after they have been fully satisfied.  We can't all have the same lives, have good jobs, nice houses, success, health etc \n\nI have things in my life that other people don't have and vice versa.  They might just have to find other things in their life to enjoy\n\nThe only thing you could have done was to tell your brother in advance to prepare his partner but I don't think any amount of preparation would stop her from being upset that other people are joyous", "Yta\nA quick heads up beforehand to them would have been easy and given them time to deal with it in private", "NAH\n\nThe fact is, at some point you were going to have to tell them, and that probably wasn't going to go down well no matter what. And they reacted as most people would react in this situation. It sucks, but that's unfortunately what the situation is.", "NAH. You have a right to be excited and share your news. It would have been kinder to let your brother know in advance. Brother\u2019s gf wasn\u2019t wrong to be upset when her fertility is an issue and hearing the news on Mother\u2019s Day.", "NTA. This is something to celebrate and enjoy, as a family.\n\nIt is obviously difficult for people that can\u2019t have children. SIL didn\u2019t seem to be angry at you guys. She\u2019s just upset at her own situation. And that\u2019s very understandable. Your brother and SIL didn\u2019t try ti cause a scene or draw attention to them, which is commendable and shows that they are truly happy for you. \n\nYou did the right thing, sharing how you did. My congratulations to your family.", "NTH- but could\u2018ve done it in a different way like told them beforehand in a seperate conversation as a warning like: we know it is a touchy \u2026", "YTA.\n\nYou should have told them first and separately and let them know you where going to announce it.\n\nAnyone that is saying n t a I doubt have had fertility issues.\n\nI think there reaction was probably normal under the stress they are under.\n\nI'd call and apologise, say you should have told them first and give them a bit of time.\n\nYour saying you weren't sure how to tell them and discussed way but then absent-mindedly blurted it out in the moment.  Any considerations you claimed before announcing don't mean anything.", "NTA.\n\nFor gods sake what is it with people mot being able to announce joyous pregnancies? It sucks that your brother and SIL are struggling but people get pregnant all the time and it\u2019s something they\u2019ll unfortunately have to deal with. Congrats!", "NAH. You are absolutely within your rights to share such happy news with your family. It\u2019s not at all an overreaction for your brother\u2019s girlfriend  to be upset, and your brother to be concerned. Your dad could do with learning some empathy though.", "NAH- their reaction was natural and it doesn\u2019t make them AHs.. but you being happy and wanting to celebrate your pregnancy also doesn\u2019t make you an AH. Unfortunately they have to live in a world surrounded by people who can have kids while they can\u2019t and that sucks.. but it\u2019s no one else\u2019s job to tiptoe around them. Celebrate your growing family but understand they might not want to be a part of the process just yet and let them have space.", "\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb couldn't have said it better myself", "They could've been a hell of a lot more sensitive though and absolutely made a decision not to be at the expense of ssomeone elses feelings", "Everyone downvoting you has never felt the pain of not being able to have kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLack of empathy.", "I agree with this take on it.", "Oh yes, if I get pregnant I need to sit and make a list of everyone I know that hasn\u2019t successfully had a kid, and make sure to warn them all before I let anyone know. No. OP wasn\u2019t not \u201cdecent\u201d and neither were the others.", "I don\u2019t understand how Reddit hasn\u2019t worked this out yet. It\u2019s the answer to every single AITA for announcing my engagement / elopement /pregnancy / sexuality in a public setting? \n\nEveryone else ignoring the grieving party\u2019s feelings is just an AH I hope I don\u2019t meet in real life.", "You sound so kind and full of love. Not self centred at all.", "Yikes, have you any empathy? A heads up to your brother (whom you supposedly love and care about) is not \u201ctiptoeing around their happiness\u201d. \n\nLiterally costs you nothing, but makes a huge difference for them. People that won\u2019t even lift a finger to be kind to others are so sad.", "Not quite, because this was the 'announcement' that the couple felt was spoiled. The ahead-of-time warning is a phone call or message or email so the person being warned can have their initial emotional reaction without upsetting anyone. If you're going to burst into tears from sheer jealousy and longing, it's nicer to do that at home where no-one can see, and then put on your \"Congratulations\" face for the dinner, rather than involuntarily sob over the chop suey or race to the room next door, leaving everyone staring awkwardly at their noodles.", "No, it\u2019s not.", "Not everyone. But certainly your *one sibling.*", "I know your second paragraph was meant to be the cut that proved your point but it kind of makes OP less of an asshole. I mean brother and SIL couldn't even muster up some fake happiness. Would have cost them nothing", "Not having a baby does not entitle you to be the first to know when someone else is. Sorry.", "No one is expecting anyone to \u201cstop celebrating their life\u201d. Fr we\u2019re telling OP he could have shot them a quick text about it, not to get an abortion.", "That\u2019s very subjective, different people value different things more highly than others. \n\nEmpathy? Where\u2019s your empathy for the pregnant couple who\u2019s happiness is being pissed on just because his sister doesn\u2019t have the same? It\u2019s childish as fuck", "Because the situation hurt. They wanted a baby abd it just was not happening", "I don\u2019t understand how expecting empathy from your own family is entitled.", "Yeah god forbid someone gets something before you do, they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be happy until you are, amirite!? \n\nHonestly psychotic how some women convince themselves they\u2019re the centre of everybodies universe and nothing at all can be more important than their feelings \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah. People should be able to celebrate their pregnancy without you putting a downer on it", "God forbid we take someone else's struggles into consideration just so we can show off Infront of everyone even though we could have been sensitive but decided not to. Grrrr", "Expecting everyone to tiptoe around the subject, and having to know before anyone else is entitled. It isn\u2019t your baby. I\u2019ve had multiple miscarriages. At no point in time have I ever thought I\u2019d have the right to determine when/where/how others announce that they didn\u2019t have a miscarriage.", "Not really no. If anything they should be happy they reconnected because life is short!\n\nYou haven\u2019t suffered by not having a kid. It\u2019s not a right someone has taken from you. It\u2019s just luck of the draw.\n\nIt\u2019s like me telling my friends that celebrate putting a deposit down on a house that they have to tell me first and be really careful about how they spread the news because I can\u2019t afford to yet and it upsets me, then crying any time someone brings the new house up or if I see pictures of it online.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure my friends would drop me faster than a hot potato", "\u201cBe happy with your parents on your own\u201d \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f imagine being so self absorbed you literally cannot be happy for other people unless you already have what they have.", "God forbid you push your own feelings aside and celebrate other people\u2019s happy news and are pleased for them! No! Everything has to revolve around you doesn\u2019t it? You must be the centre of everybodies thoughts because you can\u2019t get pregnant \n\nSo childish and selfish. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly be happy for other people if I don\u2019t have the same or better than them\u201d", "You just said that informing all your loved ones about another member of the family coming into existence is showing off.\n\nYou do understand that is not what showing off is right?  The fact that you think it is seems concerning.", "Sending a text is \"going to great lengths\"?", "Trying to have a child, a living, breathing, human being that will grow inside your body and be reliant on you for years is a far cry from a house.\n\nTrying for a baby doesn't mean you never get pregnant either. You might conceive and lose the baby in the first few weeks. No one would know unless you told them. If you have suffered miscarriage, or if you are struggling to get pregnant, even hearing about someone else's pregnancy shines a very stark light on your own problems. Believe me, that hurts.", "Nope. Not what tacky is at all. Words mean things. Your choice to misapply words does not magically make your opinion informed or accurate.", "Oh, and how I felt when I finally got pregnant was not contingent on the reactions of others when I told them about it. I would have felt awful had my good news resulted in someone else's pain, if it turned out I could have avoided it. You would have felt differently?", "Yes, when literally 100,000 new & different things are filling their plates. Unless if a tragedy such as miscarriage or a failed medical procedure/assistance has happened within the same time frame & the families are made aware of what's happening, the minds of a newly pregnant couple are very much so scattered & they're likely not focused on what's transpiring around them.\n\nAs someone who cannot have children herself, I think it's a bit much to **expect** others to know everything that I'm not only going through but feeling. If they're a fertile-myrtle, they likely aren't going to know how I feel on a deeper level & that's ok. I wouldn't want them to experience such emptiness, or feeling like a failure. As long as they are considerate of my feelings **IF & WHEN** the deeper misfortune of actually losing a child falls upon me, that's all that matters. Me being infertile or trying to have kids & failing to conceive has nothing to do with them, you know?", "I\u2019ve experienced both infertility and miscarriages and I never reacted that way to other people, whether my sister or my best friend or anyone else getting pregnant.  Was I sad and hurting inside because it happened really easily for them and I struggled and never succeeded? Absolutely but i would never want to have their joyful announcement marred by my reaction. \nNTA", "But again, it\u2019s not other people\u2019s job to manage your feelings and you trying to dull and tone down their celebrations because you find it upsetting that you don\u2019t have the same as them is incredibly selfish.", "I honestly think any considerate person who knows someone they care about is in pain isn't going to forget that just because they've found out they're pregnant. And OP hasn't just found out they've known for a month or so at this point. My 12w scan is this week, we're on the same timeframes. I've already told about my concern for my friend - who isn't even suffering with infertility, she was just struggling with not conceiving as fast as she thought she would (fortunately she's just a few weeks behind me now). I'm coming up to the point where I'll be comfortable telling my family, and I'm still worried about telling my aunt, who adopted her kids more than two decades ago. I can't imagine not caring about how the people you love will feel about something that's potentially incredibly painful and conflicting for them.", "You're correct, you shouldn't go to someone and ask them to celebrate quietly, or not at all. That would be pushing your grief onto them.\n\nBut it is something you can do to be kind. Knowing that hearing your news will upset someone you care about, and voluntarily breaking that news gently, is a personal choice. It's literally an act of kindness. Something you do because you have empathy, and because you care about how others feel.\n\nI'm not suggesting that you *have* to do anything. I'm just saying that you can *choose* to do something kind. If someone did that for me, I would be very grateful. If one of my friends was hurting I would absolutely try not to add to that pain, *because I care*.\n\nCan you think of no one you would try to protect in that way?"]}
