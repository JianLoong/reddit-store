Congratulations on the baby.  You were respectful of your brother / SIL's feelings when timing your announcement.  She also politely excused herself to avoid becoming emotional and ruining your announcement.  It was a difficult situation.  It sounds like they are happy for you and sad for themselves at the same time.  It is possible to have conflicting emotions.", "NTA - You're allowed to be happy for your pregnancy and want to talk about it. It's not your fault that they are having issues having a kid.", "NAH - just an unfortunate situation. You should be allowed to break the news to your family about something exciting that is happening to you. It's an important life event that shouldn't be done over text message IMO.\n\nThey should also be allowed to feel heartbroken and cry that they desperately wish they could have a biological child and they are seeing everyone else around them living their dream. Feelings happen. I don't doubt that they are happy for you. They are just hurting and don't find that \"rude\" at all. Just unfortunate.\n\nCongrats on the baby, by the way!!", "NAH. This was going to hurt no matter how you said it, but you had to say it eventually. I don't think you're an AH for doing it the way you did, this doesn't sound malicious or like you wanted to rub it in their faces. You knew it was a touchy subject and handled it as delicately as you could. Unfortunately, I think this was going to upset your brother and his partner regardless. And I don't think they're necessarily AHs for feeling the way they do. It hurts when you struggle to achieve something and someone achieves it before you. Give them time and space to process their feelings. The only person I'd deem an AH would be dad for calling them selfish. It's not selfish to feel things and be unable to contain those feelings. It's a human reaction.", "NTA.  I struggled to get pregnant, but I was always quick to congratulate others and accept that I could be happy for them and sad for me.  Fertility issues are *hard* but the world doesn\u2019t stop turning for anyone else.  I\u2019m sorry your news didn\u2019t get properly celebrated, OP.", "Soft YTA. You should have told your brother and his partner in a way they could process their feelings in private. They can feel happy for you while also feeling absolutely fucking devastated about their struggles.\n\nWould have been better to tell the parents without bro and SO present and to tell your brother via email/text so that he and his partner could work through their complicated feelings in private rather than be put on the spot. \n\nThey aren't assholes for having feelings.\n\nYou aren't assholes for being excited.\n\nBut you are a bit assholes for being insensitive and putting them in the position of having to deal with their emotions in the middle of a family event.", "Situations like this are hard to navigate. NAH.", "Honestly, I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted to eternity for this, but I think everyone saying Y T A who have had infertility issues aren\u2019t being truly unbiased in this situation. \n\nThis is clearly NAH IMO. **Could** you have given your brother and his gf a heads up about your pregnancy? Yes. Are you obligated to? No. Does it make you an AH not to give them a heads up? **Absolutely not.** Your pregnancy announcement is your news to share to whom and when you want, (barring stealing a loved one\u2019s thunder.) \n\nI\u2019m so tired of people talking about \u201csomeone\u2019s weekend\u201d as if \u201ca day\u201d isn\u2019t enough to give to someone when celebrating a special occasion. It\u2019s exhausting. We\u2019re creating societies of people who think they\u2019re princes and princesses whenever they have a life achievement, celebration, or something as small as a bachelor\u2019s party, which isn\u2019t even the main celebrating event. I know this is going to shock people, but on any given \u201cspecial day,\u201d thousands of other people are also celebrating, having \u201cspecial days,\u201d or have something going on that doesn\u2019t revolve around other \u201cspecial day\u201d celebrants. I agree - OP shouldn\u2019t show up to his brother\u2019s wedding and announce his pregnancy, but I can\u2019t imagine a more appropriate setting than **literal Mother\u2019s Day** to share this wonderful news. \n\nAnd yes - I\u2019m not blaming OP\u2019s brother\u2019s gf for having feelings. I\u2019ve had my own pregnancy struggles and it is normal and natural to have complicated emotions when you\u2019re struggling with wanting to have a baby so badly and either failing to get pregnant or having miscarriage after miscarriage. She did the appropriate thing when she realized she couldn\u2019t separate her sorrowful feelings from someone else\u2019s joy and left the room. \n\nThat said, the real AHs here are the people insisting that OP is an AH for not telling his brother\u2019s gf their special news before their own parents. Let me spin this a slightly different way. I\u2019ve also had my share of health issues. During one of these crises, I told people about my health problem as I felt ready, when the moment felt right, and based on who I felt would give me what I needed most. I had people I genuinely love interrogate me on who already knew and then chastise me and tell me they couldn\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t tell them before other individuals, or demand that they should have been the *first* to know. My private business had turned into a pissing contest for how well I considered other people\u2019s feelings. Sharing pregnancy information is honestly no different. Nobody is an AH for not telling someone about a pregnancy regardless of how it impacts the person hearing the news. It\u2019s truly sad that OP\u2019s brother\u2019s gf is struggling to get pregnant. I empathize. It still isn\u2019t OP\u2019s responsibility or ethical obligation to pander to her feelings to the point of sharing pregnancy news with someone so unconnected with OP in order to \u201cspare her feelings\u201d and \u201cgive her time to grieve.\u201d It\u2019s also not reasonable to expect OP to acknowledge an entire weekend of \u201cspecialness,\u201d especially over a bachelor\u2019s party. **NAH** and this is a hill I\u2019m willing to die on.", "NTA, guessing you are in the UK as you referenced Mother's Day.  It was the perfect time to tell your parents.  Your brother and his partner need to learn to deal with other couples announcing that they are expecting.  Pregnancies around the world do not end because they are having issues.  Their attitudes took away the joy for your parents.  Take them out to brunch next weekend and have a real celebration.", "NTA. \n\nYou can\u2019t not tell them, otherwise you\u2019ll have to hide the baby forever. \n\nInfertility sucks, but it\u2019s not your fault.\n\nCongratulations by the way! I\u2019m sorry your family couldn\u2019t act excited.", "NTA.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou were not intentionally cruel here, but this situation could 100% have been avoided with a little forethought on your part. \n\nWhen I was going through my fifth failed IVF and my sister got pregnant, she pulled me aside to tell me in private before she announced to everybody. She knew I would have emotions about it and wanted me to be able to process them in private, which was hugely kind of her.\n\nThen I was able to grieve on me own, move on, be happy for her, throw her a shower, etc. Without the humiliation of a public reveal where I had to feel my feelings in front of everybody.\n\nIt would have been kinder to give her a heads up before announcing. Mother's day is already a difficult day for infertile women and you just compounded her grief. I just think that had you thought about how your sister was going to feel, you could have easily sidestepped this situation with grace.", "I don\u2019t think this news was going to necessarily go over well no matter how you presented it. You had to tell them. NTA. And congratulations!", "NAH. You could have done it better. You should have spoken to your brother and his partner privately. But you're not wrong to be excited and they aren't wrong to be hurt", "NAH\n\nIt is so hard to know how to handle these types of situations, and everyone reacts differently. It seems like you tried your best to be respectful, and your brother and SIL tried to manage their reactions appropriately. \n\nPersonally, I think the best way to handle this situation would be to speak to your parents first. Give them the news and allow yourself to be excited with them, without guilt. Then tell them that you would appreciate them keeping the news to themselves until you speak to your brother privately. Don't wait too long to avoid an accidental slip. Then, you speak to your brother privately, just the two of you. Allow him to inform his wife and them to react privately without judgment. IMO, this is the most cautious way to handle it. There is really no good way to tell someone that you are easily getting something they have hoped for, so unless you're rubbing it in their faces, you handled it ok.", "Nta your allowed to be happy be pregnant and you have to tell them sometime. It not your fault they can't be grown up enough to be happy for you. I can have kids but my brother announced his pregnancy lately I would never be upset that I'm getting a new niece it suck but that life your dad right there the ones int he  wrong", "NAH but you should have announced privately to your parents so they could be super excited and privately to your brothers and SIL so it could be gentle and in a safe space for them.\nYou are allowed to be excited and shouldn't be hiding. Your brother is going to need to get used to this as there are going to be tons of events for and about the baby.", "NTA\u2026.. why the fuck do people make it awkward for the people who CAN conceive and cater to those who can\u2019t? I understand being sad or disappointed but once someone struggles with fertility in a family it\u2019s like a dark cloud that hangs and takes away from the joy and blessings that the other children born into the family truly are. Congratulations and you have nothing to be sorry for.", "Not the asshole. Yes you guys are pregnant and it obviously hurts that they can\u2019t get pregnant. But they should be happy for you nonetheless.", "NTA. Your child deserves all the love from your family.

Like it had to be that holiday of all days?\n\nI get that people don\u2019t have to cater, blah blah blah. But you could have given them a heads up beforehand so they could excuse themselves. A little empathy goes a long way.", "I\u2019ve seen a lot of these posts on here. I think in future for all people navigating a pregnancy announcement with a couple struggling with infertility: pull them aside and give them a heads-up ahead of time so they are able to navigate their feelings and decide to be a part of the big announcement. I think this is the best way. NAH.", "NTA. She needs therapy and learn how to control her emotions. She can't even be bothered to be happy for you and made it about her and her issues. Are their co workers, friends and the rest of the family supposed to tip toe around them for the rest of their lives?", "NTA \nthey would've known at some point that you were having a baby. you didn't do it to intentionally spite them or add insult to injury, it's up to you when you want to announce it, it's your baby afterall. \n\nhowever i don't think your brother and his wife are the assholes here either. it's understandable why they were hurt", "Soft YTA\n\nDid you really need to announce it the same weekend as your brother's stag? And on mother's day while you were all gathered with the family. That of all days, come on. You could have waited a week or given them some heads up.", "NTA Your joyous news should not be hidden like a dirty secret. It is fine to share such news with family. I am sorry your brother and his GF haven't been so lucky yet. People aren't going to stop having babies or hide pregnancies because someone is having problems conceiving. Nor should they hide their good news. I am sure they will run into many pregnant couples and babies in the future. It isn't feasible for everyone to pretend that it isn't good news or that it isn't happening.", "Why on earth would you not tell your brother privately first so he can tell his wife and they can brace themselves and deal with the feeling it stirs up?

I don't think it's the OP's fault this happened.

Yes, my sister knows, and isn't exactly the most empathetic, but I don't blame her for not being where I am. No one has the same journey. I can still be joyful that my sister and her husband have new additions to the family, and acknowledge that it is subdued by my own hardships. My parents are overjoyed to be grandparents, and I'm glad to see them with the kids. Someday it will be with my children.\n\nI think OP's family didn't know how to react, but that's no one's fault. She can speak with her sister and just make sure she's alright.", "This. Soft YTA.\n\nI myself dealt with years of infertility and did ivf. The correct way is to let them know before hand so they can privately process their emotions. Mother\u2019s Day is an extra sensitive time so that probably felt like salt in the wounds.", "Agreed! I got \u201clucky\u201d that my mom saw a Christmas photo of my brother and his girlfriend of 2 months that had a onesie in it, so I had a heads up beforehand. Otherwise there\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve faked being \u201chappy\u201d about it after a decade of infertility. A heads up is always the way to go", "Absolutely agree. Soft YTA. \nMy husband and I were trying actively for a child, 7 years of failed attempts. My brother and his wife conceived first try, I wasn\u2019t upset. I was very happy.  Then came their wedding ceremony (they had eloped when she was pregnant), and they announced in front of everyone they were expecting again.  Their fourth (he had adopted her two boys and they had one bio at the time.). My mom was furious and left the reception. I put on a happy smile and congratulated them. And cried on the five hour drive home.  Our sister was with me and helped me talk it out.  Some heads up would have been appreciated. \nAs someone that struggles with fertility, I don\u2019t expect the world to cater to my sensitivity, I have three mom friends pregnant now.  It sucks sometimes to be jealous. I am very happy for them\u2026 I just can\u2019t always control the tears. \n\nMy husband and I were blessed were our daughter after 8 years of trying.  We\u2019ve miscarried twice since then, 6 years ago and are still trying. Congratulations, OP. But I would still offer them an apology.", "Yup. Soft YTA. Mother's day is hard for people experiencing fertility issues, that combined with this announcement must have been gutting. All of that could've been made easier had you told your b brother in advance, so that he was aware and could decide if they wanted to come to dinner.", "Also a soft YTA for coming to the conclusion that a surprise baby announcement in front of the entire family *after* having conversations on how to break the news. It\u2019s not like they impulsively announced the pregnancy because they were so excited; they *considered* it and then decided this was the best way to break the news. Not sure what the thought process was there.", "Agree with this 100%. Announcing in front of everyone on Mother\u2019s Day seems like one of the worst ways to go if you say you realize that it\u2019s a touchy subject considering their fertility issues. I\u2019m going with YTA mainly because you didn\u2019t seem to really actually consider them even though you started off your post talking about it. Most people saying N T A don\u2019t realize how hard it is for infertile couples - her bursting into tears doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t happy for you - she is sad for herself and those two things can exist at the same time. However this doesn\u2019t make hearing the news easy as it is a reminder of how hard things are for them and how they may never get the thing they want the most and that is what upsets her so I\u2019m not going to fault her for her emotions about a very hard thing. Look, I know it\u2019s difficult for people that don\u2019t struggle with infertility to realize how to best deal with these situations - it\u2019s actually a huge learning curve for the majority of the population BUT if it was my family, I would google or even here on Reddit seek out the advice of how to best break pregnancy news in your situation - it takes almost no effort, most of the effort is having the consideration to think of it in the first place. It\u2019s the very least you can do because I hope you have empathy for your brother\u2019s situation and thank your lucky stars you never have to deal with a horrible thing like infertility. And for anyone reading, the best way to break the news is via text or email - something where they can process and respond in their own time. The best way to word the text is to begin by saying something acknowledging their hardship, announcing the news, and letting them know it\u2019s okay if they need time/distance and give them the lead on how much or how little they want to hear about the pregnancy.", "This. I don't even want kids, but life sucks enough as is and this seems to be the one silver lining and milestone you get in your work rat adult life, for people who do want them.\n\n Taking that away from the whole family cause of your personal problems is....a lot to ask. Situational empathy is one thing, but it's not the type of thing where you get ownership of the whole subject for everyone indefinitely.", "this. i feel like i\u2019m the only person who doesn\u2019t cry and do the whole \u201ci need a heads up\u201d over others being able to conceive because i can\u2019t. just like i won\u2019t go up to a woman and say \u201cwhile you\u2019re getting an abortion, i can\u2019t even get pregnant!\u201d", "As someone who \u201cgave the heads up\u201d to a sil that I was pregnant, it\u2019s a toss up.

So that\u2019s not as easy as a fix as people may assume. \n\nNTA.", "I think Mothers Day is a perfectly acceptable day to announce a pregnancy, especially with future grandparents in attendance.\n\nBIL & SIL are going to have to get used to other people breeding eventually.  They\u2019re entitled to their sadness and disappointment but people all over are still having kids in the world", "I'd say just based on the name, \"Mother's day\" is a holiday for the pregnant lady more than its a pity party for the infertile lady. It's to celebrate motherhood, so, it seems more fitting than most.", "I would agree if they told a group of family or at a large even but a lunch with just the immediate family\u2026 it seems fair.", "So the expectant mother doesn\u2019t get to celebrate on a day for mothers to be celebrated?", ">most others don't really understand or have the empathy enough to think about it.\n\nI expect people around me to have and practice empathy, and I do in return. That's what love is. \n\nI'm sorry that the people around you are so disappointing that you cannot count on them for empathy. That's really sad.", "Gah, disgusting. This type of shit is what makes me jaded about people. You try to give them a hand, they find a way to use it against you cause they're so miserable they have no further recourse but to take from others.\n\nMy philosophy on this is yolo and my uterus, my business, your uterus working or not, your business/problem. I should tiptoe around someone who is so spitefully jealous of me they need a heads up to not explode with ill-will and embarras themselves; why would I share in the misery of someone who won't share in my happiness? Pass, your problem, I have my own life to live. \n\nI'm sorry your good intentions blew up in your face.

I also told ahead and gave it another 6 weeks before I announced to our parents and my parents said we should be \u201ctoo celebratory\u201d bc it would hurt my siblings feelings. Then when we had a family gathering and the extended family found out at the lunch, my sibling ran away crying multiple times and it was both awkward and sad for the lunch. I ended up apologizing repeatedly to her still. But I still feel gratified that I did everything I personally could to be empathetic to her feelings.", "This someone getting news they have upgraded to the next level from mother grandmother", "I have been told lately that I have a lot of empathy, but that doesn't mean I will always manage to find out the best way to approach any possible situation, either. I make mistakes and bad choices sometimes, like everyone, I guess.", "That's a really mean thing to say after you expressed how much you'd want empathy. \n\nMy family and friends are incredibly supportive, but I merely expressed my sister doesn't quite understand and I don't expect her to. She has her own things to deal with. I just won't get \"empathic support\" from her.", "That\u2019s out of pocket for them. They are actively taking away the celebration and that\u2019s not okay"]}
