It\u2019s totally normal to still feel this way towards your bully, but you didn\u2019t have to treat his wife that way.

Okay so, I'm actually a huge advocate for not having to forgive people who did bad things to you. People insist it is harmful to you, but I couldn't process and move on until I gave myself permission to be angry about what certain people in my life did to me - *then* I moved on and began healing and now the only time I think of those people is when bullying discussions arise, and only in the context of \"oh yeah, I have experience here, I'd like to share.\"\n\nBut you are still at the \"never forgive, never forget\" stage  and that *is* a bad thing, *for you*.\n\nIt doesn't require blowing up for you to lose your job in a customer facing role for what you said. It will certainly be something she thinks about from time to time but it likely won't leave a lasting mark on her. If you're lucky, she's aware of what her boy and husband were like and decided to leave it alone. If you're not, she'll complain. But you need to be seeking out help to work through the trauma of the original incident because even if she leaves it alone, a complaint like that could easily come from any customer within earshot or even a co-worker who justifiably would see that as a concern the boss *needs* to know about. Hell, she might end up thinking it's kind of a funny story, tell it as a \"listen to the odd thing that happened to me\" story to friends, and it could spread from there and get back to your boss.  And what you said is enough for you to lose your job over even with the world's most sympathetic employer. You are thinking of your response as a ripple from your past memory. Your employer has to think about the ripples from your response that will affect the business. People talk, and they'll *certainly* talk about the employee they saw who, when a woman approached you and behaved in a polite and friendly manner, responded with \"I don't like you.\"\n\nAdditionally, customer-facing roles will always, *always* involve run-ins with bullies who will badger you for 10 minutes while a line up forms behind them because that onion cost 3 more cents than they think it should! And you will be expected to remain professional and polite. Hell even outside of customer service you run into bosses or co-workers who will behave like that, and you have to remain professional. A panic attack that leads to speaking back to people won't hurt them, but it will do serious damage to your job prospects.\n\nI'm telling you all this because I went through a really long phase of talking to people because I couldn't when I was a child and I was looking at the situation from that point of view, but while it short term felt good to say what I thought instead of swallowing my feelings while they got to treat me badly, I *did* see it affect both my personal and professional life, and I had to them spend a lot more time learning how to work through the feelings that had followed me from my own past. That was the path along which I figured out, among other things, that I was able to forget if I stopped trying to forgive. Other people might find they have to forgive as well, it's a different path for all of us. But you gotta figure out what yours is and get walking it.\n\nWhat the bully and his dad did was wrong and you have every right to dislike them and never want to see them again. But there were other responses than the two extremes you talk about, even if it had been one of them in front of you, and for your own sake, that's what you need to focus on now.\n\nI have excellent customer facing skills now, I also have way better conflict resolution skills and I'm happy and well liked in my role. But it took me a long time to get here, and financially and career wise, I'm way behind where I could have been. I do wish I'd sought outside help a lot sooner because a lot of my early adulthood would have gone a lot better if I'd figured out things for myself sooner. And what better revenge is there than working past the harm they did and living your best life?", "Women aren\u2019t extensions of the men in their lives.", "You judged her based on who she married.\n\nNot her personal treatment of you.\n\nYou gave 0 context on the woman in question but you were rude to her regardless- in a customer service position.\n\nDon't get me wrong -customer service is HARD. \n\nBut that's not an excuse to be rude because her husband's last name is a trigger.", "She's the one who approached OP. Yes, I think it was necessary for OP to let her know that she wasn't welcome to do so.", "Depends largely on if the op is allowed to think or feel.", "Nothing is necessary", "Eh, don't need to go quite as far back as the 80's. I was a kid in the 90's and was trusted to walk a mile or 2 to visit friends in the neighborhood. Come home when the sun starts to go down or the street lights come on. I imagine this was even more common in less rural areas where a person might not need to travel as far. And we didn't have cell phones either so it would be kinda messy if plans went amiss and you had to use someone's house phone or find a pay phone to call your parents. I don't think this was uncommon until the 2000's. But I was kind of a semi-neglected latch-key kid so I may biased by my own experience.", "Why would the husband brag to his wife about bullying a gay 13y.", "Exactly. I have no idea why you're being downvoted. Probably by a bunch of teenagers who think with their emotions. There's no reason to say \"I don't like you\" to someone you don't really know or remember that well, just because of something that probably had nothing to do with them. That's rude AF, and it's something a child does.", "But if she didn't even know, what's the reason to dislike her?", "I gotta call bullshit.\nYou know if your child is the bully. That is enough to make her complicit. Her kid was the reason her husband kept OP locked in a room until he \"confessed\". \nIt's a family of AHoles.", "Honestly, the way it's worded, I wouldn't be surprised if that moment was just part of every day counselor life for the 50yr old. I'm not saying it's right, it's not, he's an AH obviously,  but he probably thought he was catching a liar and teaching a lesson. He probably thought there was nothing to tell the wife except, \"Aw honey, I had a hard day at work today. I had to keep a kid for 2 hrs before he admitted to what he did\".\n\nAgain, he is wrong, but I'd be surprised if he thought he was wrong, if his wife had any idea of the incident, let alone remembered the incident.", "Sounds like it\u2019s the wife of the kid who bullied OP, and the 50yo was one of the parents", "people downvote on reddit cause they want to keep a moral high ground, but logistically most people would agree", "Ya um thanks for the advice unlikely anything will come of it and yes I know saving face is more Important than anything in customer service, I've been a manager before it's annoyingly so sometimes. I deal with entitled customers all the time it's fine you get what you give with them most of the time \"bad customers\" are usually just grumpy people that need a smile or someone to ask how there day is going and they magically turn into wondeeful people every once in a while you get one that what there personal problem you can't fix to be there problem and you politely tell them to stop harassing your employees and to leave or go to customer service that product won't be in tell tomorrow I already told you where the 3 closest other stores around us are. Sometime you have to draw a line on the sand. But alot of the time grumpiness and a vendettas get mistake for each other by disgruntled employees. Thanks for the advice though.", "She was a customer, she didn't need to be welcomed, OP should be working, not talking, OP was gratuitously rude and an AH, even if speaking facts, because it wasn't necessary to comment on it, it wasn't the time, nor the place to do so.\n\n\nOP could easily have acted a little bit professional and avoided the situation by saying, \"Anything else I can help you with Mrs. Customer?\" thus ending any chances of small talk, but instead went and said: \"I don't like you, specially your husband.\", nobody goes of their way to do that and pretend for it to be purely factual, OP wanted to be an AH and knew that was a rude thing to hear, that's why he said it.", "He is working a counter in a grocery store.  She is certainly welcome to go up to the counter and speak with him.  Sounds like she tried to make small talk while ordering some grocery items.", ">But I was kind of a semi-neglected latch-key kid so I may biased by my own experience.\n\nOOOH same. \n\nMy mom basically let me raise myself and then my sister. I moved in with my dad at age 10. He was protective and attentive. I was so independent, though- I was already a pretty much a small train wreck.", "And at work.  Saying something like that to a customer could end up costing OP his job.", "Naw man bullies are 2 steps below fascists. \n\nLet that shit be known, actions have consequences.", "I'm of the thought that your choices of companionship reflects greatly on your character. I'm almost certain that's not the case for everyone, but I have no problem with guilt by association for bullies and their supporters", "I couldn\u2019t tell from how OP wrote it.", "I was very emotionally mature for my age as a kid, but as an adult I feel way behind. Like I learned how to survive but never learned how to thrive and actually put my goals first over just...staying alive. I was the youngest so not very similar to your experience, but fucked up in my own special way. Lol.", "I agree bullies are awful but she didn\u2019t do anything!!! She is not guilty just by association, especially when OP doesn\u2019t even know if she knows anything!", "What you just said has literally nothing to do with what I said. If you want to target a bully, then why target a non-bully? What is your logic here?", "Fascists? That came out of no where, lol.", "That's pretty wild. If my girlfriend murdered someone, and I had no idea, how in the world should I get haunted by that person's ghost too?", "I agree, it\u2019s a bit confusing the way it was written", "This sub is often packed with \"company you keep\" arguments, so why should someone who chose to marry this person be exempt?", "Lots of people deal with the unknown consequences of their partner's actions, I'd be shocked if there weren't any indications about that person's personality prior to discovery. And like ignorance of the law doesn't excuse crime, it doesn't matter to the victim in this bullying situation", "Just because people deal with unknown consequences of their partners actions, doesn't really make it right. \nI think there are a lot of easy ways to hide things even from your partner. \nI just can't wrap my head around being hated for something I know nothing about and had nothing to do with.", "Ok, well I don't think you're considering the feelings or perspective of the victim. \n\nThis person in front of them (who was around during the bullying) has given their bully joy and happiness, and it's joy and happiness that was taken by the bully.  You wouldn't feel any negativity towards this person, whom has supported your bully for years? Giving him the very things that he tore from you?", "There are people out there that I dislike, for whatever reason. But I also like their spouse. \n\nWe'll have to agree to disagree I guess."]}
