If she was aware, do you think she would have been so friendly to introduce herself? \n\nYou're aiming your anger at the wrong party.", "NTA - some things you are allowed to keep grudges about and being intimidated and harassed by a grown ass man is one of them. Especially one that forced you to accept responsibility for your own bullying.", "NTA. Anyone who is close with a bully/abuser knows they are bullies/abusers.\nShe made an effort to explain her relationship with someone that abused you, she's a major AH and probably an abuser herself.\n\nI personally belief that social niceties are used by abusers as a means to keep their victims silent. You were concise and clear, and not rude, with shutting down her attempt at bullying you. You showed a lot of love and self preservation, be proud of that, and don't let anyone else convince you otherwise", "yta slightly\n\nShe wasn't there when this shit went down, right? So you don't actually know if she was aware of what happened. Creepy old man is responsible for his own actions. Don't blame everyone for his actions.", "I once had a several bullies in school. The leader apparently had a sister, who I'd meet 5-10 years later. Bully went by 2 letters for his name. Bully's sister was a cashier, and she recognized me; not sure how exactly. We talked for a while, and I had just decided to ask for her number. Before I could ask, she mentioned 2 letter bully's name was her brother, and apparently he said nice things about me.\n\n\nLuckily I'd already paid, I just grabbed my bagged items and left.

Unless the wife specifically knew about it then there was no reason to talk to her like that. She's not the one who bullied you and instead it would have been a moment to explain what her husband did. \n\nShe may have serious issues with what he did as well but isn't given the chance to judge him on it.", "NTA I find it hard to believe the wife didn't know her husband (who she's still married to) held a minor in a room for 2 hours. Or at least know he's as homophobic as the sky's blue, and been pushing nonsense on minor children who aren't his own. Other kids were doing activities with the other chaperones, and no one noticed Mr so and so and the only kid who's gay and constantly getting bullied for it, is both missing at the same time?? That's red flags for sure. And if the wife wasn't there at the time, I find it hard to believe their child, someone else's child, or any of the other chaperones DIDN'T accidentally let slip that that had happened.\n\nYou weren't even unprofessional; you simply told her you remembered her, but didn't like either of them. You then continued to do your job and make her whatever she needed. You didn't spit in her food, yell, or cause any sort of disturbance.

If they consider that unprofessional, I'm not sure what to think of humans anymore.", "NTA \n\nbut is grammar not taught in your state?", "YTA. You were at work and you were rude to a customer. It's a good thing that you still have your job. She brought up the name and the connection, and you could have just let it be or not commented on her husband. Instead you said \"I don't like you\".   \n\n\nSeriously, she did nothing to you. Your beef is with her husband, not with her. So take it out on him.", "YTA because you're supposed to be professional at work.  I completely understand your situation and feel for you but you could get fired for that.", "I don't think AITA is really the right question in your case.

Sure, they'll never live or learn anything, but they'll be safe.", "It is absolutely possible and likely she's a victim. However, I think people are sometimes too black and white about this -- her being a victim doesn't mean she can't also be an enabler who causes/contributes to harm herself. Sadly, this is not a terribly uncommon situation in cases where someone is in a marriage to an abuser for a long time. Sometimes a victim will turn around and enable their spouse's abuse of other people. It is the case with my parents (my mom, a definite victim deserving of empathy, also enabled my dad's abuse of us kids, and actively pressured us to stay silent about it and never disclose it to other people. And I've seen this dynamic in other families as well). Her status a victim of her husband is not ultimately the thing that would make OP an AH automatically. It's really her role in the abuse OP suffered that is more relevant -- was she silent and enabling of her husband's abuse of kids like OP? Did she see that as no big deal? It sounds like OP doesn't know if she was aware what happened. But OP simply saying he doesn't like her or her husband is not like a huge blow-up. It's a pretty minor statement, and given the fact that he was traumatized by OP's husband, I don't think it's some horrible transgression for him to just honestly state that he doesn't like them.", "No it is a child. It is abduction (and yes also detainment, but mostly kidnapping), because the definition of that is \u2018the unauthorized removal of a minor (a child under the age of legal adulthood) from the custody of the child's natural parents or legally appointed guardians\u2019. Not letting a child leave to be with its parents is exactly that.", "Stop gaslighting bro", "Although, just to add to your comment at the end -- yes, she may well be a victim, but she could also be an enabler at the same time. Sadly that does happen in those kinds of situations. People who are abused by their spouse can turn around and enable their spouse's abuse of others, even going out of their way to defend the spouse and minimize what happened to victims. (This is the dynamic of my own parents, and while my mom is a victim who I have a ton of empathy and sadness for, she also enabled the abuse of her own children and actively encouraged/pressured us to be silent about it and not tell anyone outside the family. I've also seen this play out in other families as well. It can be an incredibly complex dynamic, and victimhood does not absolve one of accountability for harm they commit or actively enable. Now, whether or not this applies to OP's situation, I have no idea whatsoever. But I don't think OP is automatically wrong for being blunt with the wife just because she may be a victim too -- it depends more on whether she was/is an enabler of her husband's bullying/abuse of OP and other kids. I have no insight on the answer to that though haha).", "I'm sorry that happened to you without parental support.", "I worked at a childrens charity until 2020, one of the things it did was put on afterschool clubs.

I biked everywhere without a helmet, and I skied without a helmet. I survived.\n\nToday, in my 50s, I do both of those activities with a helmet, because it's the obvious thing to do... and in some cases it's the law, and/or at least you'll get dirty looks and reprimanded if you don't follow along with everyone else.\n\nBut here's the thing. Your chances of getting a serious head injury are far greater in a car and/or walking on the sidewalk. FAR greater. Which means, if it makes total logical sense to be wearing a helmet cycling or skiing, why isn't it mandated for being in a car or simply walking down the street?\n\nIt's a rhetorical question, and it doesn't have a good answer. If you're ever in a car accident and bash your head... or slip/trip on a sidewalk and fall backwards... you sure as hell will wish you'd had a helmet on.", "What part of the OP says, or even suggests, that she even knew?\n\nBy the way it's a rhetorical question.

They were always there for me, and attended every single school and sporting event I can remember. Weekends were spent together, always. My parents, both of them, would take time off work to be with us for important events.\n\nOn the other hand, I guess, perhaps you'd call them neglectful because they worked so hard to make sure my life was better than theirs. They both worked, and I'd be on my own after school for a few hours... playing hockey in the street, riding my bike, even taking a bus or two downtown just to hang out.\n\nI can assure you, none of us felt neglected, nor were we. What we were is far freer to learn how life actually operates without parents helicoptering over us.\n\nAnd I'm speaking now on the other side of the equation, with two kids now in their 20s but for years, indeed, my wife and I were the helicopter parents. Not because I wanted to be, but because society expects it. \n\nI'd wanted to put my 10-year-old on a bus to figure out the way to and from a certain location, all on their own. I might have gotten arrested for it -- for something that was totally normal when I was a kid.\n\nMy parents, and those of my friends, gave more of a shit than you'll ever understand.
