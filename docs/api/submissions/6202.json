I was around four months pregnant when he passed unexpectedly.\n\nMy now husband (28M) and I had originally planned to have a small wedding party prior to my due date, but given my enormous loss, we decided to just get the legal stuff sorted instead. I wasn't in any sort of headspace to have a proper wedding without my dad being there but I did want to make things easier regarding the legal protection marriage provides, naming our baby, next of kin, etc.\n\nOur two witnesses were supposed to be each of our brothers. My mum wasn't up to social events (she still isn't really), and we simply didn't invite my in-laws. We were to turn up to the registry office, sign the papers, then head home. We thought we'd have a proper party in a few years, when I was more up to it.\n\nDespite this, my in-laws ended up inviting themselves anyway so we were forced to make more of a day of it than I was comfortable with.  My mum joined us as she felt obliged due to my in-laws decision. (In retrospect, me and my mum are actually glad this happened as ordinarily she would never have wanted to miss any life event of mine). I don't like to make a fuss so we went out for food afterwards.\n\nI was recently talking to a colleague about this, and she directly told me I had made an AH move not inviting my in-laws, and if she were them, she'd never have spoken to me afterwards. This threw me because I had considered her a friend, and assumed she was sensitive to my grief.\n\nI felt justified previously but this conversation had thrown me, AITA?\n\nEdit to add details: a comment accused me of not considering my husband's wants but he's an extreme introvert and never wanted a proper wedding in the first place, but he would've if he thought I wanted one. It was just signing documents and not an actual wedding, there were no guests so nobody was actually excluded in favour of others.\n\nEdit to add more details: his parents were told of our wishes, they just ignored them as they often do. We accommodated them and we're still on good terms.\n\nAlso, thank you so much for everyone commenting in support regarding my loss.

You two made the executive decision for yourselves not to invite parents (in part because you felt yours wouldn\u2019t be up to come), and that\u2019s a totally okay personal decision. They found out and forced your hand, and you accommodated them.\n\nIt\u2019s frankly not your coworker\u2019s business, but as told you didn\u2019t exclude anybody (and your in-law\u2019s got what they wanted, which is trouble for another day).", "Your husband is their son.

You were going through a difficult time so you wanted an unconvential wedding. However, a child's wedding is a huge deal and most parents wouldn't miss it for the world. As you can see in retrospect, you're glad your mom was there for a big event, and I bet your husband is too.\n\nI don't think you were an AH for not inviting them because you were grieving, but it was definitely a shitty thing to do. People will probably say your wedding your rules, but in the real world being together with family for big events is important, and I think everyone will be glad a boundary born of grief was crossed so they don't regret it forever.

My husband actually lost his father a few years ago and it still bothers us to this day so my sincere condolences. \n\nWhen he and I got married, we skipped the wedding mainly because we lived across the country from each other and I would need medical insurance when I finally moved out there. So he flew in a few months early, we did the courthouse thing, only my parents were there as witnesses, and he flew back. \n\nThis was all just for the legality of it and if your husband was fine with the arrangement then I don't see the big deal.

Me and my late husband were official witnesses to a couple who eloped to Cyprus to get married and were going to have a party to announce it all after they got back.

Secondly Don\u2019t die on hills that are unworthy of even fighting on the hill.

I got knocked up at 25 after my previous previous marriage had ended and I was legally divorced for 10 days! Now before I get slut shamed I was legally separated from my ex husband for a year before the divorce happened.  It\u2019s was a big oopsie that I got knocked up before the ink was dry on my divorce.  We did decide to marry after I made it through first trimester.

I was embarrassed that this happened and my family was very upset I got knocked up too. I DIDNT WANT THEM THERE! They got up early, dressed up in like church clothes and arrived before we did. They were showing me love and support even though they were disappointed.  It meant so much to them to be a part of it they ignored my wishes and what they did was RIGHT! I would be devastated if my son got married and they told me not to come!  He is my only child and it would crush me!  So many people don\u2019t have good parents that care about them but y\u2019all do and you need to to include both sides not just yours! You made a choice to start the marriage off bad from get go and need to apologize!  You would think people have to lose a limb by how difficult it is for them to say sorry!

I'm sorry about your dad \u2639\ufe0f", "\u201cUnborn baby was going to Hell because you weren\u2019t married.\u201d And there it is. NTA", "Um...that's a lot worse than her comments about his parents, so NTA, and try to avoid talking to this miserable person.", "Stop talking about your personal life with this colleague. It will come back to bite you.", "YIKES. I commented above that your colleague is TA and HOLY HECK that's so much worse than I thought. Screw that judgmental Beyotch, how DARE SHE??", "Well, I think you could take that last statement as a sign  you shouldn't believe anything else she says.", "That is the most awful based religiosity possible. Babies are innocent angels born human. I would not call her a friend and I would make better friends in the future. I don't have a problem with religion, but a lot of God's earthly representatives really damage the brand.", "\u2665\ufe0f", "What got me is that the in-laws weren't invited because HER mom didn't want to attend... (Aside from that, zero issue with her decisions.)", "She did NOT tell him that his parents could not come. THEY decided not to invite them. THEY decided to have only the two witnesses there, and make it a low key thing.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. This was a mutual decision by you and your husband. What is more concerning is the fact your in- laws ignored your wishes. Hope that doesn' t become a pattern with them. Stand up for what you want. NTA. PS Your co- worker is bat crap crazy. Distance yourself from her.", "I speak from experience when I say NTA. \n\nMy son got married last year, and like you was going to \u201celope\u201d, with witnesses from their destination. Like yours, his in-laws insisted on attending so he asked us to come too.  I was THRILLED to be invited, and would have been sad not to be there, but ultimately, it was their choice.  And to be honest, I think giving our son and DIL the respect to make that kind of decision without any pressure from us has helped start off our relationship with our DIL on the right foot, so it was worth it.", "NTA.", "But tell me one thing, you may be not in a celebratory mood but atleast let your husband have his set of parents for his support was ideal. Your mom was not a social person, your dad is no more(sorry for your loss). What about your in laws ?\n\nJust don't celebrate but making sure they are present at signing would have been wise. Have you asked what your husband wanted? I am sorry but i feel YTA.", "NTA - Obviously you weren't too thrilled in the moment that they ignored your wishes - but in hindsight, you don't seem too upset, and it seems like your inlaws weren't upset that you didn't invite them, they just sensed that you would regret not having them there so they went anyway. \n\nThe only person who is upset is your coworker, and their opinion simply DOES NOT matter in this situation. If you're okay with it and your inlaws, mother, and husband are fine with it then no harm no foul, everybody is on good terms and that is all that matters. Your coworker should mind their own business frankly lol", "YTA", "Your friend is the ass hole. I don't think anything you've described has any unusual occurrences in it. You are very accommodating and you even said you are glad it all ended up the way it did. The in-laws, however, need not be in the know of your private affairs else you will always have uninvited guests. Keep your chin up and learn to own your mistakes and hold strong to your beliefs.", "NTA\n\nYou and he decided on the wedding of your choice, and the plan was pretty sound.  Your inlaws were very rude for showing up and inviting themselves to this event.", "As the mother of a soon to be groom I will say that I would not force myself into the courthouse as OPs ILs did. However if I weren\u2019t invited to my sons courthouse wedding I would be devastated. I raised him. I love him with all my heart. Getting married is one of the most important life experiences a child will have. Yes, I want to be there to witness it, even just a courthouse legal ceremony. I would not cut him off. I would continue to welcome him and his family into my home. But, I would be hurt. I imagine that I would feel that hurt with every child\u2019s birth, every anniversary and probably other times as well. Problem is weddings are usually more important to the women, so even though her husband was part of the decision she would bear more responsibility for the lack of invite in most MILs eyes, including mine. Also, just want to point out that it turned out the ILs forcing themselves in turned out for the best because it forced OPs mom to attend and both she and OP acknowledge they would have regretted it if she had missed such an important day in her daughters life. All that to say that yes, it is the couples decision but it seems to me that OP was so caught up in her own grief and family situation they were a bit thoughtless toward HIS parents.\nI hate to put myself on the side of OPs awful workmate but I have to go with YTA.", "NTA. Your in-laws were the AHs for inviting themselves to your ceremony. My husband and I got married at the registry office (with only his best-friend as a witness) without telling anyone until the day after. Our families were disappointed that they were not there but, thankfully, they understood that it was OUR marriage and our decision to be married how we wished.", "Finally a response I agree with.", "Girl, she is not your friend.", "Oof, honey, that doesn\u2019t sound like any type of friend.", "That\u2019s harassment.

You got married that day- your relationship was officially changed from girlfriend to wife. The party is immaterial and also unimportant -its not even a thing you have any plans to do!! So please stop being coy. If the day didn't matter you wouldn't have invited your mum and both of your brothers. You could have gone to the courthouse yourselves and had strangers as witnesses. But it was special and you did want those closest to you there. You just don't count his parents as close......", "Totally!\n\nThere are a lot of assumptions made in a bunch of comments about your husband\u2019s lack of agency that have caught me off guard, because there was nothing in your post that suggested your choice wasn\u2019t something you chose together. While I understand parents being *disappointed* at a lack of a traditional wedding, the idea that they would be \u201churt\u201d by the choice and that being \u201churt\u201d over it somehow makes you an AH is a little wild. It\u2019s 2023, people don\u2019t have traditional weddings all the time for all kinds of reasons!", "Are you trying to be purposely dense or something?? OP has mentioned MANY times that it was a joint decision."]}
