I was around four months pregnant when he passed unexpectedly.\n\nMy now husband (28M) and I had originally planned to have a small wedding party prior to my due date, but given my enormous loss, we decided to just get the legal stuff sorted instead. I wasn't in any sort of headspace to have a proper wedding without my dad being there but I did want to make things easier regarding the legal protection marriage provides, naming our baby, next of kin, etc.\n\nOur two witnesses were supposed to be each of our brothers. My mum wasn't up to social events (she still isn't really), and we simply didn't invite my in-laws. We were to turn up to the registry office, sign the papers, then head home. We thought we'd have a proper party in a few years, when I was more up to it.\n\nDespite this, my in-laws ended up inviting themselves anyway so we were forced to make more of a day of it than I was comfortable with.  My mum joined us as she felt obliged due to my in-laws decision. (In retrospect, me and my mum are actually glad this happened as ordinarily she would never have wanted to miss any life event of mine). I don't like to make a fuss so we went out for food afterwards.\n\nI was recently talking to a colleague about this, and she directly told me I had made an AH move not inviting my in-laws, and if she were them, she'd never have spoken to me afterwards. This threw me because I had considered her a friend, and assumed she was sensitive to my grief.\n\nI felt justified previously but this conversation had thrown me, AITA?\n\nEdit to add details: a comment accused me of not considering my husband's wants but he's an extreme introvert and never wanted a proper wedding in the first place, but he would've if he thought I wanted one. It was just signing documents and not an actual wedding, there were no guests so nobody was actually excluded in favour of others.", "created_utc": 1672585185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100lc4e/aita_for_not_inviting_my_inlaws_to_my_wedding/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You two made the executive decision for yourselves not to invite parents (in part because you felt yours wouldn\u2019t be up to come), and that\u2019s a totally okay personal decision. They found out and forced your hand, and you accommodated them.\n\nIt\u2019s frankly not your coworker\u2019s business, but as told you didn\u2019t exclude anybody (and your in-law\u2019s got what they wanted, which is trouble for another day).", "Your husband is their son. What did he say about them not being invited? Didn't sound like he had an issue.", "Your coworker is a jerk. Why would she even say such a thing, it doesn\u2019t affect her at all. NTA.", "NTA\n\nAs it was your ceremony, you could invite or exclude anyone you wanted to for any reason.", "NTA and your colleague should mind her own business.", "NTA, your wedding your way. If the happy couple just want to have two witnesses - whether they are friends/family or complete strangers - instead of a massive crowd that is completely up to them.", "NAH, I think. You were going through a difficult time so you wanted an unconvential wedding. However, a child's wedding is a huge deal and most parents wouldn't miss it for the world. As you can see in retrospect, you're glad your mom was there for a big event, and I bet your husband is too.\n\nI don't think you were an AH for not inviting them because you were grieving, but it was definitely a shitty thing to do. People will probably say your wedding your rules, but in the real world being together with family for big events is important, and I think everyone will be glad a boundary born of grief was crossed so they don't regret it forever. Emotions are complex and I don't think it's as simple as 'I make a rule and it has to be obeyed.'", "I am sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA.\n\nYour life event, your rules.\n\nYou are lucky to have a husband who backs you up in such decisions that involves in-laws. Best of luck to you and your family.", "NAH. Grief hits everyone differently. You weren't wrong to want it the way you wanted it.\n\nAnd I don't know that your inlaws were wrong either. I usually don't like gate crashers, but in this case, if it triggered your mom to do something which she would have regretted not doing later, I think it's a forgivable crime.\n\nI'm so very sorry for your loss, but congratulations on your marriage", "NTA- you reasoning doesn\u2019t matter. You went to get a legal marriage. No one except the required witnesses have to be there. Your situation is more akin to eloping. It\u2019s not like you had a huge wedding and failed to invite your in-laws. Definitely not the AH. Where you made a mistake is telling them ahead of time that you both had gotten married. You should have waited until after. But of course that is hindsight. You probably couldn\u2019t have predicted they would force themselves into the event.", "NTA.  My husband actually lost his father a few years ago and it still bothers us to this day so my sincere condolences. \n\nWhen he and I got married, we skipped the wedding mainly because we lived across the country from each other and I would need medical insurance when I finally moved out there. So he flew in a few months early, we did the courthouse thing, only my parents were there as witnesses, and he flew back. \n\nThis was all just for the legality of it and if your husband was fine with the arrangement then I don't see the big deal.  Your coworker is just being an uppity piece of work.", "Please don't listen to your friend.   You are NTA! \n\nYou had planned to just have a very simple marriage ceremony in the registry office,  and had not planned on having anyone other than official witnesses. You handled your in-laws crashing your ceremony with grace and class.  You also informed your mother so she wouldn't feel left out.   You did very well.", "Firstly, sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA.\n\nYour friend is the only a$$hole here. You have the right to decide how your wedding should be. Whether its a simple one at the registry office or a massive one with multiple guests. Your father's death is a monumental event in your life which is more than a reasonable cause for scaling back the wedding.", "So your in laws crashed your wedding. You\u2019re not upset with them. They\u2019re not upset with you. I assume everyone is in good terms. So whatever she thinks is unimportant.\n\nAlso your in-laws, if they have any feelings (unlike the norm we seem to see here), wouldn\u2019t cut you out when your father died and you\u2019re gonna soon give them a grandchild.\n\nNTA", "YTA. Your dad wasn't there so your husband's family couldn't be there? Why couldn't they witness this milestone for their son?

Did he mention them at any point in the new planning once your father had passed?", "Off course YTA, but your husband is worse.\n\nThese are his own parents he has disrespected and treated as minor characters.\n\nI am sorry about your father, but that doesn't mean your PIL than get automatically dumped.  My parents cant / wont come so yours dont get invited.\n\nYour colleague is correct if I was your pIl I would have nothing to do with you both.", "YTA. I haven\u2019t seen an explanation within your post about what your husband wanted. Grief is all-consuming but did your husband\u2019s feelings not get taken in to account? His parents may have hoped and dreamed for him to have a happy wedding day his entire life, they may have discussed it in the past. For them not to be invited because your dad has passed away is truly awful. It is not their fault your dad passed.", "NTA because you a grieving and pregnant/new baby and I can\u2019t imagine the arrange of emotions you cycle through daily. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss but welcome to the new one!\n\nHowever, your husband, I\u2019m not a fan. \n\nI get the feeling that, had your mum been up to joining, you would have invited her. \nBut because she couldn\u2019t go, oh well, who cares about my husband\u2019s parents?!?\nWhy is he allowing this?\n\nYou don\u2019t mention that\u2019s there is any tension with the in-laws or that they do not have a relationship. So, if you can honestly say you would not have invited your mum either way, fine. Otherwise, your husband is TA.", "Soft YTA for not inviting your in laws because you were grieving the passing of your father and your mother did not feel like attending. Why punish the living in-laws by excluding them from the small wedding ? I mean the brothers were called, not like it was going to be just the two of you. \nIt was irrational and the best thing that you can learn from this is to know that you can be like that when emotions are high. An outside perspective helps to balance things and your experience can be applied in the future.", "Info\n\nHow did your husband feel? Was there a particular reason they weren't invited? How is his and your relationship with your in laws? I feel like there's a lot of back story missing.", "I do nit think you intended to be an AH but not inviting parents is cruel. Unless they were terrible people, then that would be acceptable. Sorry for the loss of your father.", "You\u2019re NTA, you were fair and included your respective brothers only. You were grieving intensely and making a practical decision to benefit your baby. Your partner supported your choice, so this wasn\u2019t a forced decision. \n\nWhile it sounds like your in-laws were pushy, it also sounds like they are not holding a grudge and neither are you. You\u2019re rightfully a little salty looking back and telling the story but you seem at peace now. You\u2019ve even pulled the positive from something frustrating which is charitable to your in-laws despite them being overbearing. \n\nAnd say a little prayer for this woman\u2019s future in-laws. Not every disagreement has to become a Cold War. Sometimes you can all shrug and move on. There will always be other hills to die on.", "YTA. \nIt\u2019s your wedding day it sounds like it was more so just paperwork, for you on this day. You\u2019re life your marriage between you and your husband not a day you were ready to or wanted to share. Which is valid and no one should meddle in it. \n\nHowever, you invited your mom and not his parents. Did your husband really not want his parents there? They found out about it from someone and if you didn\u2019t tell them who did? I am sorry for your loss but his parents are still here and want to be apart of his life it\u2019s giving my grief over his feelings just a tad. Which is why YTA. Not for wanting a private wedding. Good luck to you and your family.", "NTA", "Your co-worker is an AH. They are not understanding how you just lost your dad and don't want to be a big thing until you are ready.

For now, do what is best.", "NTA - your friend is being a judgemental tool, here. Disregard her unsolicited and insensitive advice.
