I was around four months pregnant when he passed unexpectedly.\n\nMy now husband (28M) and I had originally planned to have a small wedding party prior to my due date, but given my enormous loss, we decided to just get the legal stuff sorted instead. I wasn't in any sort of headspace to have a proper wedding without my dad being there but I did want to make things easier regarding the legal protection marriage provides, naming our baby, next of kin, etc.\n\nOur two witnesses were supposed to be each of our brothers. My mum wasn't up to social events (she still isn't really), and we simply didn't invite my in-laws. We were to turn up to the registry office, sign the papers, then head home. We thought we'd have a proper party in a few years, when I was more up to it.\n\nDespite this, my in-laws ended up inviting themselves anyway so we were forced to make more of a day of it than I was comfortable with.  My mum joined us as she felt obliged due to my in-laws decision. (In retrospect, me and my mum are actually glad this happened as ordinarily she would never have wanted to miss any life event of mine). I don't like to make a fuss so we went out for food afterwards.\n\nI was recently talking to a colleague about this, and she directly told me I had made an AH move not inviting my in-laws, and if she were them, she'd never have spoken to me afterwards. This threw me because I had considered her a friend, and assumed she was sensitive to my grief.\n\nI felt justified previously but this conversation had thrown me, AITA?\n\nEdit to add details: a comment accused me of not considering my husband's wants but he's an extreme introvert and never wanted a proper wedding in the first place, but he would've if he thought I wanted one. It was just signing documents and not an actual wedding, there were no guests so nobody was actually excluded in favour of others.", "created_utc": 1672585185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100lc4e/aita_for_not_inviting_my_inlaws_to_my_wedding/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As you can see in retrospect, you're glad your mom was there for a big event, and I bet your husband is too.\n\nI don't think you were an AH for not inviting them because you were grieving, but it was definitely a shitty thing to do. People will probably say your wedding your rules, but in the real world being together with family for big events is important, and I think everyone will be glad a boundary born of grief was crossed so they don't regret it forever.

My husband actually lost his father a few years ago and it still bothers us to this day so my sincere condolences. \n\nWhen he and I got married, we skipped the wedding mainly because we lived across the country from each other and I would need medical insurance when I finally moved out there.

So a weird win.", "I do wonder if the colleague just said what we were all thinking and if the husband really didn't care if his parents were there or if he just went along with what the OP wanted.", "Holy hell. This person is not a friend, interact with her as little as possible.", "You are right. I guess reading all those posts on Reddit where spouse sides with their AH parents made me appreciate this more.", "That is awful and I'd raise this with HR, she is nasty and cruel. Congrats on the baby and marriage, ignore the haters.", "You keep saying this.  This was your wedding.  You were not married, now you are.  You will not ever have a ceremony.  A maybe party in the future is not the same.  You and your mom are now glad she came.  Because it was a milestone, you said yourself.  Because it was your wedding.", "He was 100% part of the decision, and did suggest it, he's my rock. He's very introverted and didn't want a proper wedding anyway. Our brothers were the only signing witnesses in the end as well.\nThank you for sympathising with the situation :)", "I don't think that was the question, though, it's not about the lack of a party. It sounds like you checked with your mum and she said she wasn't up to go, but didn't ask your in laws at all. How did he feel about that, about not inviting his parents to what clearly is a big milestone? You said both you and your mother are happy she ended up going, do you not think that, controversy aside, your husband is also happy his parents ended up being present? And it was clearly important for them too, don't you think that, just like your mum's feelings about the day are important to you, so are the feelings of the other parents?\n\nYou were clearly dealing with grief, and your coworker sound way to invested, but I actually think it was rather shitty of you to only consider your side of the family and their feelings, and not your husband's and his side's.", "With all due respect, 'their not really that close' and 'they don't get invited to their son's wedding' is very different. And you say it wasn't s wedding party, wich, sure, but it was your wedding day, and you are now glad both them and your mum where there.\n\nYou haven't clarified if you invited your mother or not, but the comment of 'my mother wasn't up for social events' sounds like you asked and she said no. And you say that your husband was happy about not having a wedding party, but how did he feel about not inviting his parents to the signing ceremony?\n\nI'm glad you're happy with how things ended up going, and I am really sorry for your loss and understand that your grief took precedence at that time. But I do think that it'd be good for you to keep in mind for the future that just because his family is not as close as yours, that doesn't mean is fair to dismiss them.", "Make it a goal for the new year, talking about your grief is the best way to stop the struggling.", "If people want a courthouse wedding just to sign the legal documents to be legally married without any festivities this should be respected. Ignoring the boundaries of the couple is rude and selfish. It\u2019s not okay to project your own ideas about what a wedding should be onto others.\n\nMy MIL kept pushing my BIL and his now wife to have a celebration dinner afterwards (because she thinks a wedding day is important and therefore you should celebrate) to the point my BIL got very annoyed and catty. They didn\u2019t care for a dinner, they just wanted to be married for legal and practical reasons. They wanted their wedding to be something for just the two of them and they would\u2019ve flown to Vegas if they had the money for it to spare (we\u2019re European, not American). When my MIL was complaining and arguing why it was important to have some kind of celebration for the zillionth time to my partner, he told his mother to drop it as it\u2019s not her wedding but theirs.", "That\u2019s fair. There is no way to really know for us, but for OP, she should talk to him about it, because even though he\u2019s introverted and might not want a wedding, that doesn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t want his parents to see him get married. But obviously, OP was pregnant and grieving a huge loss. It\u2019s easy to see how he might have figured her needs are more important than his at the moment.\n\nBut, even so, I still say YTA for not telling the ILs the plan, because I know my parents would be devastated not to have seen me get married, even a courthouse wedding.", "Yeah I don't call her a friend anymore, just a colleague \ud83d\ude02", "I figured as much. I like to pretend that maybe people are actually married to good people who understand each other and not everyone is \"me me me\". I must be crazy lol. \n\nBut I'm glad you found your rock. They're weirdly hard to find.  \u263a\ufe0f", "I think since the mom wasn't coming they decided it wouldn't be either. That's how I read it.", "I think she already did? Her edit says her husband is an inteovert and wasn't interested in a \"proper\" wedding unless she was, so I would hope that means they had a discussion about it. Doesn't necessarily mean he couldn't have been saying something to make her feel better about the decision, but we'll probably never know if that's the case or not.", "Comments like these from a coworker should be reported to HR immediately. She's creating a hostile work environment for you (and probably for other people). I'm sorry you have to deal with her.\n\nCongrats on the upcoming baby!", "Oh my goodness, he's the best person and I'm so lucky to have found him! They are definitely weirdly hard to find! :)", "Yeah, I took that to mean they discussed the party she wants in a few years, not necessarily if he/his parents wanted to be there to see their son get married. But, like you said we\u2019ll never know."]}
