The original deal was that because of the circumstances you are paying Kelly's rate. You agreed to that deal. The salon agreed to that deal.

Her behavior was inappropriate.  The salon inconvenienced you.  If you had been told the correct rate over the phone, you would\u2019ve never come in.  Putting you on the spot once you got there was wrong. Bait and switch comes to mind.  The price was almost double for the same thing.  You got the same haircut you would get with Kelly and you paid the same price. Tammy should have refused to do the haircut if she felt that strongly about it.  Bitching the entire time about how much she usually charges is beyond unprofessional and guarantees you will never book an appointment with her in the future.", "NTA.

The fact that they clarified it would be the same rate BEFORE you showed up, they owed you the $68 rate.  It was their fault and honestly, they should have known what to quote for rates before you even drove there.", "NTA - Tammy is a jerk.", "NTA.\n\nPoor communication on their part.

It seems the fault here is with the management at the salon as they did not communicate with Tammy that she was covering for a sick co-worker and would be accepting a smaller fee for this particular cut.  If Tammy didn't like it at that point, she could have complained to her manager and refused to take the job.\n\nSo... no fault to you.  This almost seems like a bit of bait-and-switch, and you didn't fall for it!", "NTA. You just held them to the agreement.", "NTA...You were promised the same rate and demanded the same rate.  This seems perfectly reasonable to me!", "NTA\n\nI would have put it down to a miscommunication, but she seems to be angry at the price she agreed to.", "NTA, but you did fold; you gave her a $20 tip when she deserved nothing.", "NTA. \n\nI wouldn't have tipped to someone who was spending the entire time guilt tripping me for paying the agreed upon rate set by the manager.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
