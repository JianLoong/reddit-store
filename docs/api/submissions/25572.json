Saying I was in line first. When she told OP \"we were in line at the same time.\" How is that being their first? \n\nIf I was in that case I would told her to shut up too since she was harping on it. I don't believe this is a teach people a lesson case personally. I don't think I can classify it as anything. \n\nBoth rude but I don't think the A.H for telling the woman harping on it to shut up. \n\nI get your side of a E.S.H but I personally don't think OP sucks for telling the woman to basically knock it off.", "She said something twice which isnt over and over. \n\nOP was well aware they arrived at the same time and then decided they should be first regardless so I think Op was rude first. \n\nMost of the time in that situation you give , oh are you getting in line too? Did you want to go first..? etc.. why did the lady have to point it out? Op knew and ignored which is probably why the \"scoff\".\n\nThere are two sides to every story.  \n\nWould it change your opinion if the women WAS there first but then op swooped in and they had to stop because of it? \n\nI bet this women believed fully she was cut... \n\nShe should let it go but its all relativ"]}
