He is a South Asian Muslim, but was born here in America, while I am White and Christian. He is not very religious, but I am fairly devout in my own faith. His family is also fairly religious and his mother and sister both wear hijab. We live on the west coast, but both of our families are on the east coast, but my family lives in the south and his family lives in the north so they are far away from each other. This is all relevant.\n\nThe two of us flew out to visit my family for Christmas and New Year's. We flew in on the 22nd and the plan was to stay until the 2nd, when we'd be flying back home. His dad has been fairly sick for a while, and just a day after we arrived at my parent's house, he passed away. This was unexpected, since he'd been doing better recently. Obviously my fianc\u00e9 was devastated and instantly booked us both flights so that we could attend his funeral together. We would've flown out on the 24th, so the flights were fairly expensive, booked last minute as well. Of course, I was sad to miss Christmas with my family and my parents were very disappointed, but I was happy to go to support him.\n\nHowever, a few hours before we were going to fly out, he informs me that I'll have to wear a hijab to enter the mosque for the service, and would not be allowed to go to the graveyard either. I did not feel comfortable doing this, so I told him I would rather not go. I figured if I couldn't attend the service, I might as well just stay with my parents so we could still do Christmas together, and he could come back to join us. This was a very hard decision for me to make, but my parents helped me a lot in making it.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 seemed okay with the decision and left without me, although before he left he asked if I couldn't just come and not attend the service. He attended the service, but he hasn't come back, and told me on the 29th he'd be doing New Years there and hasn't messaged me since. His sister, who I've always been close with, texted me and told me how disappointed she was in me and that what I did was wrong. I don't think I did anything wrong since I couldn't attend the service anyway. She also said I should've at least paid him back for the flight that he got for me, but it was almost $1000, and I simply can't afford that. My fianc\u00e9 makes almost 5 times as much as I do, and his family is also very wealthy, so I know the money is not an issue. My parents agree with me and said that it was important to spend Christmas with them, especially since it's the first after being engaged. They also think it was wrong of him to completely abandon me and our plans for New Years. My sister said I should've gone anyway to support him. AITA?\n\nEdit: I would just like to mention that my parents (and me as well) wanted him for New Years to show him their support since we are his family now too. Not to party or anything. And plus, his sister posted a picture of him, her, their other sister, and his childhood best friend all laughing together and captioned it \"making sure your brother brings in the new year with the three women who love him most\" (probably because she knew it would make me upset) so it's not like he couldn't have spent New Year's with us.\n\nEdit 2: I wasn't being selfish at all. I understood that his needs took priority, but I just don't think there was any point to going if I couldn't attend the service, especially since he was supposed to come right back and I could give him all the support he needed. If I had known he was going to stay longer, I would've flown out to see him. I'm respecting his needs by allowing him to have as much as space as he needs and allowing him to spend time with his best friend, despite the fact that he knows I don't like her. It's not like I'm unwilling to make sacrifices for him.

During all of those in between hours when he wasn\u2019t at a religious location and you could wear whatever you wanted without compromising your own beliefs.\n\nYou stayed home to do fun holiday stuff while he sat on a plane ALONE. Surrounded by people going on vacations and wearing Santa hats (I flew on the 24th this year, too). Do you not see how much that sucks? Do you not see that your presence would have been helpful to him?\n\nI cannot believe that your parents have the gall to be upset with him. Ask them what they\u2019d want if the roles were reversed.

Would they excuse your partner skipping the funeral because he\u2019s got a holiday to celebrate?\n\nIf you are still together after this, you need to do some serious thinking about what your marriage is going to look like - because he might not be religious, but his family is, and that means compromise sometimes. But that\u2019s if he forgives you for abandoning him at his lowest.", "Hmm. I am an ex- Muslim, who left the religion for a variety of reasons, but the unfair expectations of modesty for Muslim women was one of them. However, I am still very close with my family and the predominantly Muslim community around here. I don\u2019t go to the mosque unless there is a funeral. But when I do, I cover my head.\nWhen I went to Thailand, for vacation, we were told to enter the temples we needed to be dressed modestly. I thought one of my dresses was long enough because it went to the knees, but it wasn\u2019t, so they asked me to wrap a sarong around my waist. I did it. I\u2019m not somehow more Buddhist than I was five minutes prior to that. \n\nMy brother is Muslim, and one of the only guys I know that wears clothes that cover his elbows and knees, which is still less than the expectation for a similarly strict Muslim. So I get that there\u2019s a lot of hypocrisy about modesty that is really frustrating. But I think you should perceive it as a cultural observation, not a religious one, unless it\u2019s bleeding into other aspects of your life.

Of course your parents agree with you- they just want to spend the holidays with their daughter again. But you should have supported your soon-to-be-husband.

If you don't like how that sounds, I recommend you don't get married.\n\nI am also very firm in my Christian beliefs. I would have worn hijab.

Similarly, being excluded from the service: that was such a small part of the trip, a few hours out of the days and days he will be there.

The thing is, you are supposed to become your fianc\u00e9's nuclear family, but your decision shows you still view your parents and your own culture/religion of origin as more important than supporting him during one of the hardest events of his life.  Wow, just re-read that and let it soak in.\n\nAlso, your fianc\u00e9 wasn't insisting on the hijab for his own personal reasons - it was the mosque's rule. It's like when you go to the Vatican, you need to have your shoulders covered. Even if you aren't Catholic, you do it out of respect.  I don\u2019t think you are actually prepared to love and support this man in a healthy marriage because you don't know how to compromise your own needs to support him when he needs it the most.

I personally think the idea of having to cover certain parts is stupid, but a funeral or wedding is NOT the time to have that particular theological debate.

I'm being genuine in asking. I can't believe how you completely didn't see how selfish you were at such an important time in your fiance's life and how you made this about you. I think you need to really take stock of your empathy capabilities and what you think a committed relationship should look like. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if he has already decided he is ending the relationship, and if he decides this, you need to just let him go, because you clearly do not love him or see him as a partner. In fact, do him the kindness of just ending it yourself so he doesn't have to be the bad guy in his still vulnerable state. \n\nI am stunned.

He is a South Asian Muslim, but was born here in America, while I am White and Christian. He is not very religious, but I am fairly devout in my own faith. His family is also fairly religious and his mother and sister both wear hijab. We live on the west coast, but both of our families are on the east coast, but my family lives in the south and his family lives in the north so they are far away from each other. This is all relevant.  \nThe two of us flew out to visit my family for Christmas and New Year's. We flew in on the 22nd and the plan was to stay until the 2nd, when we'd be flying back home. His dad has been fairly sick for a while, and just a day after we arrived at my parent's house, he passed away. This was unexpected, since he'd been doing better recently. Obviously my fianc\u00e9 was devastated and instantly booked us both flights so that we could attend his funeral together. We would've flown out on the 24th, so the flights were fairly expensive, booked last minute as well. Of course, I was sad to miss Christmas with my family and my parents were very disappointed, but I was happy to go to support him.  \nHowever, a few hours before we were going to fly out, he informs me that I'll have to wear a hijab to enter the mosque for the service, and would not be allowed to go to the graveyard either. I did not feel comfortable doing this, so I told him I would rather not go. I figured if I couldn't attend the service, I might as well just stay with my parents so we could still do Christmas together, and he could come back to join us. This was a very hard decision for me to make, but my parents helped me a lot in making it.  \nMy fianc\u00e9 seemed okay with the decision and left without me, although before he left he asked if I couldn't just come and not attend the service. He attended the service, but he hasn't come back, and told me on the 29th he'd be doing New Years there and hasn't messaged me since. His sister, who I've always been close with, texted me and told me how disappointed she was in me and that what I did was wrong. I don't think I did anything wrong since I couldn't attend the service anyway. She also said I should've at least paid him back for the flight that he got for me, but it was almost $1000, and I simply can't afford that. My fianc\u00e9 makes almost 5 times as much as I do, and his family is also very wealthy, so I know the money is not an issue. My parents agree with me and said that it was important to spend Christmas with them, especially since it's the first after being engaged. They also think it was wrong of him to completely abandon me and our plans for New Years. My sister said I should've gone anyway to support him.

I\u2019m all about feminism, but jfc your fianc\u00e9 just lost his father. And the choice about where the service was is his father\u2019s choice, not his.

It's not about the service, it's about you being there to support your husband on one of the worst days of his life.  \n\n\nMy FIL was Muslim.  My husband does not practice any religion (nor do I), but he father was a religious man, and so it was a Muslim funeral at a mosque.  I was not able to go into the main area.  I was sent to the 'women's and children's' area where we could watch the service via video.  I don't speak arabic so really had no idea what was going on.  I had to wear a scarf, not something I'd done before, but I literally just grabbed a scarf I already had and wrapped it around my head.  I had to buy a long sleeve shirt to cover my tattoos.  I was not able to BE THERE for my husband during the actual service.  Nor was I allowed to go to the grave site, so I just went home for that part.  \n\n\nI barely saw or spoke to my husband that entire day because of the gender separation in the mosque.  But I was there.  I was there to hug him when the service ended.  To dry his tears after the burial.  To make him feel he was not alone and even though he couldn't see me, I was still there, and being as supportive as I could given the circumstance.  \n\n\nIt's not about you or where you can or can't go or what you can or can't wear.

Big time.\n\n\nI'm not muslim, but if a muslim friend of mine asked to go to a family funeral, you bet your ass I would research the customs of the mosque the service is held in. \n\n\nI'd ask said friend or their family members what would be appropriate to wear, which colours/ jewelry to avoid, and if there are any formal greetings/ other customs that I should respect. \n\nAnd also where to buy/ get the best scarves/ dresses or any other type of clothing for an event like this.", "YTA.\n\nHis father died. \n\nYou did not go to support your fiance for selfish reasons.

During one of the biggest moments of his life. He'll remember who was there for him during this time.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if he's reconsidering the entire relationship. \n\nWhen my father died years ago, my ex was kind enough to drive me home but then made last minute plans to visit his family to avoid having to deal with my family's grief. We were already in a long and established relationship. Him not being there honestly hurt me a little more than my dad passing at the time. \n\nHe's an ex for a reason. \n\nI'd recommend showing up there as soon as you can to support him and then grovel for forgiveness about not being there if you want a chance to save your relationship.", "YTA. As someone who is in a mixed marriage both my wife and I partake in each other's cultural outfits, events, celebrations, etc. She's Christian from Europe but in a funeral in their culture they cover their heads with a small cloth to look like Mother Mary did with her head scarf thing. I am an Atheist but for a funeral I'll attend, pray, etc. So it's all about support and compromise. Word of advice you are not cut out for a mixed marriage. You need someone with your own beliefs. Sorry if I sound like a dick. But you have shown him you are a unsupported partner during a very difficult time. His father's passing. His role model, his superman, his father whom he might be looking up to passed away and you were not there. End of story. Doesn't matter if I was not allowed to attend in my wife's case I would be there waiting for when he comes out of the ceremony to show my support. I would not be celebrating Christmas while my partner is mourning. I would be with her doing whatever needed to be there. You should have been there in that picture with your partner and sister in law. You messed up big time. He will never feel truly supported by you. You will always seem selfish to him and his family. It's pretty much over. You need to learn what is needed out of a partner to be supportive. I'm surprised your family did not encourage you to go. Your sister on the other hand has some common sense. She understands that you have to be there in whatever capacity for your partner.", "YTA\nYour fianc\u00e9 was grieving, and he needed you there. Yes, you can be uncomfortable with pieces of religion not aligning with your own, but is that more important to you than comforting your mourning fianc\u00e9? Also, a lot of religious Christians and such like to believe it\u2019s important to always spend the holidays with your parents to (I\u2019m just bringing this from what I\u2019ve been around and experienced in the south) but really, if it\u2019s your first Christmas after being engaged it is 100% more important to spend it with your significant other. If you\u2019re going to have a life together you need to step a teeny bit away from parents (not completely) and more toward your significant other. Of course spend time with your parents, but it seems OP is too close with them and is allowing what they think to control their decisions too much. \nOP needs to have a long discussion with their fianc\u00e9, and to figure out whether this relationship can or can\u2019t work.", "I was born in a Muslim country and I am Christian. I still wear a headscarf for all the funerals that are for a Muslim person. You sound super self centered. YTA.", "YTA, his dad died. He even asked if you would come and not attend the service.

You've just proven beyond doubt that you aren't someone he can rely on.", "YTA. Your fiance is not Christian, but still went to visit your family with you to celebrate Christmas. I'm assuming it was because he understands it is important to you. \nIt's not that you COULDN'T attend the service. You made a choice not to attend. You didn't feel comfortable putting on a hijab because you don't follow his religion? Explain to me how that is different from him celebrating a Christian holiday with you. This was a very difficult time for him, and you chose your comfort over his needs. \nIt is NOT important to spend a holiday with your parents.

A few hours of wearing hijab was too hard for you, so you wouldn't go and support your husband? \n\nThe Bible says for us to do unto others that which we would have done unto us. So if your husband decides he does not want to go to your parents' home for Christmas because he isn't comfortable, that's fair. \n\nMy spouse got sick. Very sick. During the height of Covid.

Clearly you do not respect his family, one which you\u2019re supposed join upon marriage.

You lack basic compassion for other people.", "It seems pretty clear your parents don\u2019t want you to be with your fianc\u00e9e and are giving you the type of advice that will cause major fissures in your relationship.

He\u2019s mourning his father and she used the hijab as a flimsy, transparent excuse to avoid one of the worse parts of the \u201cfor better or for worse\u201d. While I\u2019m sure he and his family would\u2019ve appreciated her coming to the service, that is just one part of the mourning process. It is impossible for me to believe she does not realize that, that she genuinely thinks that there is no point to going if she wasn\u2019t going to the service. If that\u2019s true, then she doesn\u2019t know how to human. When you go through this kind of loss, you are grieving deeply and continually for quite some time. His wife\u2019s job in this would be to support him and his family, helping wherever she could. Sometimes that is simply being there quietly to lean on. Sometimes it\u2019s actual work like cooking, cleaning, taking care of details to remove the burden from the family. I hope he is reconsidering marrying her because she is not partner material. She\u2019s too selfish to marry anyone. She\u2019s showing him who he is and I hope he listens.", "Well said, top comment here.", "Also atheist and feminist. Honestly I lean towards anti-theism. I've had to wear head-coverings before to go to various services. Funnily enough, I've had to wear them for Christian (Russian Orthodox) events more than I have for Muslim events. Turns out Islam doesn't have a patent on head coverings and many Christians use them as well, so the argument that this is against OP's Christian religion doesn't really hold water.", "Absolutely - I\u2019m the same as you and wouldn\u2019t think twice about wearing a hijab to Mosque if it meant being there for my partner. I also seriously doubt this was a feminist issue for OP either, given devout christianity doesn\u2019t exactly hold women up as equals.", "I feel just the same about the hijab.  Would I wear one to attend the funeral service of my FIL?  Damned straight I would.  Funerals are for supporting the living loved ones in their time of great loss.  You hate the idea of a hijab?

If he is dating a non-muslim and his family has no issue with it then they would most probably not have an issue with a hastily thrown scarf on her head, not even a hijab. Whats more is that we are pretty understanding on non-muslim in these situations. For my grandfather's funerals plenty of non-muslim came, they sat at the back during the prayers uncovered. I am thinking that he wanted her in the mosque as part of his family.", "If you don\u2019t understand how this is culturally insensitive to believe it is \u2018wrong\u2019 to cover your head to go into a religious building not your own - don\u2019t travel.

Orthodox women still cover their hair.", "And I mean, if we are going to argue the toss, the bible tells her to cover her hair, and the bible tells her that she cannot have authority over her husband, so really she has no argument to not go \"as a devout Christian\", but there again \"as a devout Christian\" Corinthians states \"be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?\" so she shouldn't be getting married to a Muslim according to her own stated beliefs, even moreso to someone of a different faith that believes that she is really a Muslim in her heart and needs to be returned to Islam. I'm not saying he believes that personally but that is the belief of Islam - hence people coming to Islam being called \"reverts\" and not \"converts\". If she was so much of a good Christian then her desire to support a loved one through a traumatic time would have taken precedence over her desire to not wear a covering over her hair, something she sees as a Muslim thing but is actually practiced not even just by some sects but is absolutely practiced by Catholicism, anabaptists, Quakers, conservative reformed protestant and Presbyterians, nuns of most denominations...

It could have even been a bonding moment between OP and future sister-in-law. I for one have never worn a hijab but have a little idea of how complicated it can be if never worn before and how many different ways they can be worn, it would have been an amazing opportunity for OP and future SIL to spend time together appreciating each others culture or even learning more about the other even during such a sad time. Yet OPs flat refusal just makes them very much TA.  \n\n\nSupporting a partner 1000% tops celebrating Christmas with family, Christmas was an arbitrarily decided date and that's coming from someone raised Christian.

Because he has a good income, and his parents have money - which is relevant to her life why? - she's allowed to waste $1000 of his money and not even offer half back, which is the absolute least she could have done. She isn't willing to cross the fucking road for this guy but she expected him to leave the funeral ASAP, leave behind his real family who love him, to come back for a \"family\" that only wants him if he pretends to fit in with them.\n\nI'm sure u/Maleficent_Piano_840 would be thrilled if he waltzed into her church dressed inappropriately though, right? \n\nI guarantee his family will never accept her now that they know what she's about.
