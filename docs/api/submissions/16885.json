Don't invalidate her feelings. She has every right to be upset and angry. YTA", "YTA \n\nMy experience is that when a high needs child eats up all of the energy and time and attention, the other child is told to stuff their feelings down at that age and it emerges somewhere else in life.  For a couple of my students it ended very, very badly.  \n\nHer feelings are valid.  She's too young to get over it for her parents like an adult. I agree with your partner.  \n\nI don't know what the \"high needs\" are, but you might cover for the parents some time so they can sleep. Help them find a respite caregiver, take the niece out away from the chaos.", "YTA.\n\nShe needs to be able to feel stuff, even if it's inconvenient for other people.Being NT doesn't invalidate her feelings of disappointment, anger, pain, joy, etc. She matters too", "YTA. This girl has not been her parents\u2019 priority for 8 years now, and likely won\u2019t ever be again. She\u2019s lost so much of her childhood as the sibling of a high needs ND kid. And now you, too, are expecting her to parent her parents?  \nI feel for her parents - I do - but it\u2019s not their pre-teen\u2019s job to soothe their egos when she has to suffer in silence.", "YTA- You're a good aunt for making sure she had an alternative plan for the cupcakes and arranged it for her. In regards to what you said though... look your niece is always going to come second to your nephew. At 12 she is realizing this (if she hasn't already before) and it must be extremely difficult to know that your brother is always going to take precedent and overshadow everything in your life. She was venting to you about it because she thinks your a safe person. Please don't invalidate her feelings. Listen to her, make her feel supported and maybe when she's not actively upset you can talk with her about managing her feelings around this. But please don't invalidate her feelings and brush them off", "YTA\n\nYou're invalidating the feelings of a twelve year old child OP. That is never okay. She apparently thought she could come to you in a moment she needed help. While you did technically help, you also taught her that she can't trust you and come to you for help because you will invalidate her. Her parents sound overwhelmed with the special needs child, and so I'm sure the girl needs someone she can rely on, and you basically just showed her that's not you.\n\nShe has every right to feel the way she feels. It baffles me that you see the difficulty for her parents, but seem to not be able to consider how hard this situation is for her too. I can't help but assume she's experiencing some level of neglect when the parents are so consumed with having to care for the brother. SOMEONE needs to be there to support her if her parents aren't able.\n\nHer parents are drowning and need help. This whole situation is not okay. It's unsafe for them to be driving and going in to work, caring for children, etc. while experiencing long term sleep deprivation. This is a dangerous mess that is going to negatively impact people's health, mental and physical, if this continues. They need some kind of professional caregiver or something in this situation so that they have time to actually sleep, as well as some amount of time to give to their daughter as well. This situation is totally untenable. \n\nI get you were trying to help, but next time don't do it by invalidating her feelings and making her feel like her issues don't matter because her parents are struggling, as she needs to feel like it's okay to come to someone the same as anyone else does.", "YTA. I understand where you're coming from and that you only wanted to help, but by telling your niece that she needs to 'take it on the chin' as it were you might be opening up the floodgates to a ton of future problems for her. She is 12. At that age she's not going to be able to rationalise the same way an adult would, but it's also important to acknowledge that 12 year olds are starting to get exposed to the larger world and far more complex concepts, they're not what would typically spring to mind when you think of a \"child\". She's probably aware of what's happening and why but that doesn't stop her feelings from being valid. Your niece has likely needed to act older than her age in order to prioritise her brother frequently, and whilst that is not explicitly anyone's fault, by not acknowledging that or trying to make up for it, she is likely to develop feelings of neglect and anxiety as well as developing a low self-esteem. 12 is right about the time that this may start showing, and I know many people who would say they started having panic attacks etc. around this time. The best way to prevent that from happening is to make sure she has someone to talk to and set aside time where she can be the main focus every so often. I'm sure your niece understands the situation but unless she's able to also acknowledge her feelings about it, they are likely to build up inside her which may have negative consequences in the long run. I don't blame you for what you said but in the future it would be best to make sure she's not constantly forced to bear more responsibility than a normal 12 year-old should as this is probably exhausting for her and could end up having a negative impact.", "YTA YTA YTA. Your niece\u2019s needs already take a secondary role to her brother\u2019s, is she not allowed to experience emotions/express them to her parents??? You were a safe place for her to express her emotional needs not being met and instead you invalidated her feelings and told her to, once again, out her needs second. Apologize.", "YTA.  Every time a NT adult talks about how much they hate their ND sibling, it always turns out that they really hate their parents for prioritizing the sibling. They need to get some help in a couple of days a week to free up some time for their daughter.", "YTA have you every hears the term glass child? \n\nThe sibling of a child with high care neds who is often unseen because sibling needs the parent more.\n\nYour niece came to you because she had been let down due  to actions of her brother and to an extent her parents. it might have been a mistake but to her it was everything.\n\nIt probably wasn't the first time something like this will have happened, ahe has probably had to deal with disturbed sleep also, we cant come to your event because of your brother has doctors appointments, we cant do that because your brother needs x y or z.\n\nShe needs an adult who she can trust and can vent to without judgment and making her feel bad. Unfortunately for your sibling having ND child does not stop the responsibilities they have to the NT child. \nI'm glad your partner was able to solve the issue but please stop invalidating your nieces emotions. \n\nWhat else was planned for your niece for her birthday if mum was at the doctors and dad was working. Was this the thing your niece was looking forward to as it was about her not about her brother. its terrible to say it but often NT children are expected to pick everything for the ND childs benefit.", "YTA it is not her responsibility to make herself smaller so that her brother can use up even more of their parents time and attention. It is reasonable for her to be upset. She was the one who was harmed and you want to make her feel even worse?  She\u2019s a kid. Support should flow to her from her parents, not the other way around.", "YTA \n\nQuite often the NT child is expected to just accept everything, less time, less attention, less thought. They are also expected as they grow up to step in and help, to give their parents a break or essentially look after themselves so the parents don't have to worry about them.\n\nI get what you were aiming for, your sister and bil are overwhelmed and you were trying to help but that's not what she heard.\n\nWhat she heard and felt was and this might seem irrational to you. My parents couldn't stop my brother ruining my one day, they couldn't even lock the cabinet. They also were comforting him, on her birthday while she was upset and you doubled down told her she wasn't allowed to be upset because she's not important here, how she felt isn't important.\n\nThat feeling sticks with a kid for a long long Time.", "She\u2019s 12. TWELVE. Not an adult but a child. She has a right to be upset. It was her birthday for crying out loud. \n\nYTA", "YTA. She is 12, a child. She is reacting as a child would. She was not trying to make anyone's life more difficult, and that's not an appropriate thing to say. Children's brains are not as developed as ours. This was not her fault. You need to speak to her in a way appropriate for her age. Her parents being burnt out is on them, not the child.", "Yta. You basically told your niece to suck it up that her feelings don't matter.  Having a high needs ND brother means she's spent most of her life having to suck it up get less attention less care less consideration less \"right\" to have a normal childhood because of him. It's not his fault it's not her parental fault but it doesn't soothe the emotional angst of a young girl who just had her birthday ruined because yes her parents were careless because they were understandably tired. They need support. But not from a 12 year old child. She didn't need a lecture or a reprimand. She needed someone on her side to put her feelings and emotions as a priority and acknowledge HER. It was nice yall got her new cupcakes...but the cupcakes debacle wasn't really about the cupcakes.", "YTA. I trust you mean well but look at it from your niece's perspective. Her parents are so overwhelmed caring for her brother that she may not ever feel like a priority. She's a child wanting to vent who should not be guilty for expressing her feelings.", "YTA. Is she ever the priority for her parents? It was her birthday the 1 day of the year that should be about her and parents still couldn\u2019t do it very sad for her.", "YTA-She\u2019s twelve. She\u2019s not an adult and is not mentally or emotionally equipped to handle problems like this the same way an adult would. The last thing she needs is an adult guilt tripping her and telling her to basically deal with it. She\u2019s already losing part of her childhood to her brother and his needs. She shouldn\u2019t be expected to suck it up on her damned birthday.", "YTA \n\nShe\u2019s a kid and it sounds like she\u2019s already put on the back burner because her brother is a lot of work. She\u2019s allowed to be upset and not have to take into account her adult parents feelings or energy levels.", "YTA\n\nDo you imagine that your neice is not stressed out? Do you think that her sleep isn't affected by her brother's (lack of) schedule? Do you think she isn't routinely taking a back seat ? Do you think she doesn't frequently feel unimportant and unseen? \n\nHer brother messed up her birthday.  Because of his neurodivergence, there can't really be consequences. Your neice  has no recourse when she gets screwed  and when a choice has to be made, her brother is always going to be the priority. \n\nThat's hard! It's even harder for a child on the brink of adolescence. \n\nYour partner is awesome for rescuing the cupcake situation but your neice had a right to be mad and instead of hearing her out, you reprimanded her.", "YTA. It is very tough to the the \"normal\" one when you have a sibling with special needs - you always have to make room for what they need, and often parents aren't good about finding ways to show you that you are also special and important, and that your needs and feelings are valid.\n\nIt sounds like her parents are doing their best, and I'm sure in time that if they show her care and consideration and DON'T always expect her to put her brother first, she'll be able to get to the point where she can cut them that slack. In the moment, though, when it's her birthday and the cupcakes are gone and it's his fault and she feels super alone and unloved, the right thing to do is to validate her feelings and make sure that she knows that SHE is your priority, not anyone else.", "Yta a 12 year is allowed to be upset when her sibling acts like an ahole. He is 8 and high needs, not an idiot.  He darn well knows he did something bad.\n\nShe's a literal child. She's allowed to be upset.\n\nDon't be surprised when she turns 18 and goes NC with all of you. You've all made it crystals clear that she is never a priority, including for her friggen bday.", "YTA, she's still a child and I'm betting she doesn't get as much time and attention from her parents (yes her brother needs more care but she probably doesn't quite understand this yet)\n\nshe wasnt making anyones life harder, what you said was unnecessary and cruel", "Sorry, but I feel like YTA here. Of course parents make mistakes but it's really hard being the sibling of a high needs child, and feeling like your life just doesn't matter as much. A little more sympathy and a little less scolding would have probably been a better tone to take.", "YTA. Please make some repairs with your niece. It\u2019s awesome that you are coming through with cupcakes but your partner is right. You completely invalidated her pain.", "YTA\n\nLike you said shes a child. She shouldn't need to bear the weight of her 8yr old brothers and her parents problems. You were kind to replace them but she has every right to feel overwhelmed in a household where I'm sure shes the bottom priority.", "YTA. You just told her that her comfort and happiness is not a priority. You told her to shelve and bury her own feelings for the sake of others.", "I don't want to call you the AH here, you are doing everything you can to help your niece and family in general. However, what you telling her here is that she can't experience her frustration, her sadness, her anger, her normal emotions at the situation, because others can't handle them. Do you want her going into her teenage and adult years with the mentality that she should make things easier for others by pushing all of her emotions down because they don't matter as much?", "INFO:\nHave you done anything to give your niece attention, 1:1 time or even a way for her to get time with her mum or dad?", "Yes you are a HUGE asshole. You basically told this child that she doesn't matter. Wtf. YTA I hope you and your sis arent planning on having her take care of him when you all get old because you're causing huge resentments. Do you want her to not talk to any of you at all when she turns 18? Because thats where youre headed.", "YTA\n\nYour niece seems like a kid who's fed up with being second to her brother all the time and this was just another moment where her brother was the front of attention.\n\nEven calling you upset, you could hear BOTH parents trying to calm her brother down, disregarding her upset on HER birthday.\n\nYour comment was neither helpful nor needed.\n\nI feel tremendously sad for your niece.", "YTA", "YTA - She is 12 years old and nobody in her family actually cares how hard all this is on her. It's incredibly hard for her and you should show more empathy. Sounds like your partner is an absolute star though.", "YTA and so are her parents. They\u2019re failing this girl", "Yta she's 12 and has the right to have emotions and have her needs met - it's incredible damaging for children to be sidelined or made into carers for their high needs siblings", "YTA. I see you have responded to other commenters conveying the issues for your niece, so I don't want to be harsh. However, your comments to her were unnecessary and damaging. You owe her a sincere apology. Yes, your sister and BiL are struggling, but they are adults, your niece despite the fact that she has been doubtlessly expected to be more mature than her years is still a child and needs someone on her side. Because despite their best intentions your sister and BiL are emotionally neglecting your niece. She needs an adult who will be there emotionally for her. If you really want to help, be that adult", "NAH. I think its less you shouldn't have said it and more theres no purpose to saying it. A 12 year old on their birthday, who probably told her classmates about cupcakes, is likely not in the right headspace to hear that so her, in my view, disrespectful. comments are really more just her wanting to defend her understandable emotions. Was her reaction juvenile? Yes. But she is a juvenile so its an appropriate reaction. Your point is right, just whats a 12 year old going to do with it in the moment?", "NTA you agreed to replace the cupcakes and asked for some emotional space for your sister in turn. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate or OK for a 12 y/o to label their parents as \u201ccareless\u201d over a mistake like this. You\u2019re a great aunt.", "NTA you were definitely the day saver, but the comment was a bit dismissive of her feelings. Everyone understands and sympathizes with the strain of parents with children with higher needs but there's also a strain on the other children as the parents often have less time for them and she's probably okay most of the time but it being her b-day and she was probably hoping for a little more attention and things just turned chaotic.", "NAH, and you saved the day. This is gonna need a follow up conversation, first with the parents and then with the niece - things happen and she has a right to her feelings, and to be upset - maybe you can talk to her about how to handle things. ND or NT,  coping skills need to be taught - making her feel bad is not ok.", "It\u2019s never to young to learn the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n12yo is old enough to understand challenges.  I have a 12yo as well as younger children.  I have said to the 12yo, \"Hey man - it's hard enough with the baby.  I need you to help out.\"  I've had that conversation with the 8yo too.\n\nThey're more than old enough to have \"reasonably mature conversations\".\n\nIt also helps develop some level of resilience and perspective.

One of them started having severe behavioral problems as a teenager, sleeping with older men and getting involved in meth, and ultimately got arrested and spent some time in prison after some trafficking and sex work charges.\n\nHaving your feelings invalidated, feeling like you have no right to feel the way you feel and can't talk to anyone about them, has a strong correlation to people self medicating. This leads people to underage drug and alcohol abuse, and severe attention seeking behavior.
