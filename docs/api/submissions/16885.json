My nephew doesn't sleep well at all and both his parents are up with him alot of the night and very sleep deprived. \n\nNephew snuck downstairs yesterday morning before everyone was up and ate most of the cupcakes (parents forgot to lock the cabinet, like I said they're very sleep deprived).

She was understandably upset bc it was her bday and she was bringing cupcakes to the class, neither of her parents would be able to replace the cupcakes on time as sister had to take nephew to a doctor's appointment (they would've been there a number of hours) and her dad had several surgeries lined up that day and couldn't get out of work. \n\nWe Live in a rural area that doesn't have UberEATS or door dash. \n\nMy partner (42f) owns the local bakery and was able to go in early to make impromptu cupcakes for my niece, and my partner would deliver it to her school (I too couldn't get out of work). \n\nSo I told my niece not to worry that I would take care of it, but to please lay off her parents that their lives are hard enough with her brother that she shouldn't make things any more difficult for them bc they're so burnt out and overwhelmed. She got angry with me bc she said her parents were \"careless\" in forgetting to lock the cabinet, I told her it was an honest mistake that anyone could make. \n\nMy partner thinks I shouldn't have said that bc she's just a child, this is true but her parents are literally hanging by a thread and I'm trying to help the only way I know how. Her parents thanked us profusely for coming to the rescue with her cupcakes and offered to pay but we declined saying it was on the house. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683729992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dsuaz/aita_for_telling_my_12_yr_old_niece_to_not_make/", "score": 3860, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't invalidate her feelings. She has every right to be upset and angry. YTA", "YTA \n\nMy experience is that when a high needs child eats up all of the energy and time and attention, the other child is told to stuff their feelings down at that age and it emerges somewhere else in life.  For a couple of my students it ended very, very badly.  \n\nHer feelings are valid.  She's too young to get over it for her parents like an adult. I agree with your partner.  \n\nI don't know what the \"high needs\" are, but you might cover for the parents some time so they can sleep. Help them find a respite caregiver, take the niece out away from the chaos.", "YTA.\n\nShe needs to be able to feel stuff, even if it's inconvenient for other people. Being NT doesn't invalidate her feelings of disappointment, anger, pain, joy, etc. She matters too", "YTA. This girl has not been her parents\u2019 priority for 8 years now, and likely won\u2019t ever be again. She\u2019s lost so much of her childhood as the sibling of a high needs ND kid. And now you, too, are expecting her to parent her parents?  \nI feel for her parents - I do - but it\u2019s not their pre-teen\u2019s job to soothe their egos when she has to suffer in silence.", "YTA- You're a good aunt for making sure she had an alternative plan for the cupcakes and arranged it for her. In regards to what you said though... look your niece is always going to come second to your nephew. At 12 she is realizing this (if she hasn't already before) and it must be extremely difficult to know that your brother is always going to take precedent and overshadow everything in your life. She was venting to you about it because she thinks your a safe person. Please don't invalidate her feelings. Listen to her, make her feel supported and maybe when she's not actively upset you can talk with her about managing her feelings around this. But please don't invalidate her feelings and brush them off", "YTA\n\nYou're invalidating the feelings of a twelve year old child OP. That is never okay. She apparently thought she could come to you in a moment she needed help. While you did technically help, you also taught her that she can't trust you and come to you for help because you will invalidate her. Her parents sound overwhelmed with the special needs child, and so I'm sure the girl needs someone she can rely on, and you basically just showed her that's not you.\n\nShe has every right to feel the way she feels. It baffles me that you see the difficulty for her parents, but seem to not be able to consider how hard this situation is for her too. I can't help but assume she's experiencing some level of neglect when the parents are so consumed with having to care for the brother. SOMEONE needs to be there to support her if her parents aren't able.\n\nHer parents are drowning and need help. This whole situation is not okay. It's unsafe for them to be driving and going in to work, caring for children, etc. while experiencing long term sleep deprivation. This is a dangerous mess that is going to negatively impact people's health, mental and physical, if this continues. They need some kind of professional caregiver or something in this situation so that they have time to actually sleep, as well as some amount of time to give to their daughter as well. This situation is totally untenable. \n\nI get you were trying to help, but next time don't do it by invalidating her feelings and making her feel like her issues don't matter because her parents are struggling, as she needs to feel like it's okay to come to someone the same as anyone else does.", "YTA. I understand where you're coming from and that you only wanted to help, but by telling your niece that she needs to 'take it on the chin' as it were you might be opening up the floodgates to a ton of future problems for her. She is 12. At that age she's not going to be able to rationalise the same way an adult would, but it's also important to acknowledge that 12 year olds are starting to get exposed to the larger world and far more complex concepts, they're not what would typically spring to mind when you think of a \"child\". She's probably aware of what's happening and why but that doesn't stop her feelings from being valid. Your niece has likely needed to act older than her age in order to prioritise her brother frequently, and whilst that is not explicitly anyone's fault, by not acknowledging that or trying to make up for it, she is likely to develop feelings of neglect and anxiety as well as developing a low self-esteem. 12 is right about the time that this may start showing, and I know many people who would say they started having panic attacks etc. around this time. The best way to prevent that from happening is to make sure she has someone to talk to and set aside time where she can be the main focus every so often. I'm sure your niece understands the situation but unless she's able to also acknowledge her feelings about it, they are likely to build up inside her which may have negative consequences in the long run. I don't blame you for what you said but in the future it would be best to make sure she's not constantly forced to bear more responsibility than a normal 12 year-old should as this is probably exhausting for her and could end up having a negative impact.", "YTA YTA YTA. Your niece\u2019s needs already take a secondary role to her brother\u2019s, is she not allowed to experience emotions/express them to her parents??? You were a safe place for her to express her emotional needs not being met and instead you invalidated her feelings and told her to, once again, out her needs second. Apologize.", "YTA.  Every time a NT adult talks about how much they hate their ND sibling, it always turns out that they really hate their parents for prioritizing the sibling. They need to get some help in a couple of days a week to free up some time for their daughter.", "YTA have you every hears the term glass child? \n\nThe sibling of a child with high care neds who is often unseen because sibling needs the parent more.\n\nYour niece came to you because she had been let down due  to actions of her brother and to an extent her parents. it might have been a mistake but to her it was everything.\n\nIt probably wasn't the first time something like this will have happened, ahe has probably had to deal with disturbed sleep also, we cant come to your event because of your brother has doctors appointments, we cant do that because your brother needs x y or z.\n\nShe needs an adult who she can trust and can vent to without judgment and making her feel bad. Unfortunately for your sibling having ND child does not stop the responsibilities they have to the NT child. \nI'm glad your partner was able to solve the issue but please stop invalidating your nieces emotions. \n\nWhat else was planned for your niece for her birthday if mum was at the doctors and dad was working. Was this the thing your niece was looking forward to as it was about her not about her brother. its terrible to say it but often NT children are expected to pick everything for the ND childs benefit.", "YTA it is not her responsibility to make herself smaller so that her brother can use up even more of their parents time and attention. It is reasonable for her to be upset. She was the one who was harmed and you want to make her feel even worse?  She\u2019s a kid. Support should flow to her from her parents, not the other way around.", "YTA \n\nQuite often the NT child is expected to just accept everything, less time, less attention, less thought. They are also expected as they grow up to step in and help, to give their parents a break or essentially look after themselves so the parents don't have to worry about them.\n\nI get what you were aiming for, your sister and bil are overwhelmed and you were trying to help but that's not what she heard.\n\nWhat she heard and felt was and this might seem irrational to you. My parents couldn't stop my brother ruining my one day, they couldn't even lock the cabinet. They also were comforting him, on her birthday while she was upset and you doubled down told her she wasn't allowed to be upset because she's not important here, how she felt isn't important.\n\nThat feeling sticks with a kid for a long long Time.", "She\u2019s 12. TWELVE. Not an adult but a child. She has a right to be upset. It was her birthday for crying out loud. \n\nYTA", "YTA. She is 12, a child. She is reacting as a child would. She was not trying to make anyone's life more difficult, and that's not an appropriate thing to say. Children's brains are not as developed as ours. This was not her fault. You need to speak to her in a way appropriate for her age. Her parents being burnt out is on them, not the child.", "Yta. You basically told your niece to suck it up that her feelings don't matter.  Having a high needs ND brother means she's spent most of her life having to suck it up get less attention less care less consideration less \"right\" to have a normal childhood because of him. It's not his fault it's not her parental fault but it doesn't soothe the emotional angst of a young girl who just had her birthday ruined because yes her parents were careless because they were understandably tired. They need support. But not from a 12 year old child. She didn't need a lecture or a reprimand. She needed someone on her side to put her feelings and emotions as a priority and acknowledge HER. It was nice yall got her new cupcakes...but the cupcakes debacle wasn't really about the cupcakes.", "YTA. I trust you mean well but look at it from your niece's perspective. Her parents are so overwhelmed caring for her brother that she may not ever feel like a priority. She's a child wanting to vent who should not be guilty for expressing her feelings.", "YTA. Is she ever the priority for her parents? It was her birthday the 1 day of the year that should be about her and parents still couldn\u2019t do it very sad for her.", "YTA-She\u2019s twelve. She\u2019s not an adult and is not mentally or emotionally equipped to handle problems like this the same way an adult would. The last thing she needs is an adult guilt tripping her and telling her to basically deal with it. She\u2019s already losing part of her childhood to her brother and his needs. She shouldn\u2019t be expected to suck it up on her damned birthday.", "YTA \n\nShe\u2019s a kid and it sounds like she\u2019s already put on the back burner because her brother is a lot of work. She\u2019s allowed to be upset and not have to take into account her adult parents feelings or energy levels.", "YTA\n\nDo you imagine that your neice is not stressed out? Do you think that her sleep isn't affected by her brother's (lack of) schedule? Do you think she isn't routinely taking a back seat ? Do you think she doesn't frequently feel unimportant and unseen? \n\nHer brother messed up her birthday.  Because of his neurodivergence, there can't really be consequences. Your neice  has no recourse when she gets screwed  and when a choice has to be made, her brother is always going to be the priority. \n\nThat's hard! It's even harder for a child on the brink of adolescence. \n\nYour partner is awesome for rescuing the cupcake situation but your neice had a right to be mad and instead of hearing her out, you reprimanded her.", "YTA. It is very tough to the the \"normal\" one when you have a sibling with special needs - you always have to make room for what they need, and often parents aren't good about finding ways to show you that you are also special and important, and that your needs and feelings are valid.\n\nIt sounds like her parents are doing their best, and I'm sure in time that if they show her care and consideration and DON'T always expect her to put her brother first, she'll be able to get to the point where she can cut them that slack. In the moment, though, when it's her birthday and the cupcakes are gone and it's his fault and she feels super alone and unloved, the right thing to do is to validate her feelings and make sure that she knows that SHE is your priority, not anyone else.", "Yta a 12 year is allowed to be upset when her sibling acts like an ahole. He is 8 and high needs, not an idiot.  He darn well knows he did something bad.\n\nShe's a literal child. She's allowed to be upset.\n\nDon't be surprised when she turns 18 and goes NC with all of you. You've all made it crystals clear that she is never a priority, including for her friggen bday.", "YTA, she's still a child and I'm betting she doesn't get as much time and attention from her parents (yes her brother needs more care but she probably doesn't quite understand this yet)\n\nshe wasnt making anyones life harder, what you said was unnecessary and cruel", "Sorry, but I feel like YTA here. Of course parents make mistakes but it's really hard being the sibling of a high needs child, and feeling like your life just doesn't matter as much. A little more sympathy and a little less scolding would have probably been a better tone to take.", "YTA. Please make some repairs with your niece. It\u2019s awesome that you are coming through with cupcakes but your partner is right. You completely invalidated her pain.", "YTA\n\nLike you said shes a child. She shouldn't need to bear the weight of her 8yr old brothers and her parents problems. You were kind to replace them but she has every right to feel overwhelmed in a household where I'm sure shes the bottom priority.", "YTA. You just told her that her comfort and happiness is not a priority. You told her to shelve and bury her own feelings for the sake of others.", "I don't want to call you the AH here, you are doing everything you can to help your niece and family in general. However, what you telling her here is that she can't experience her frustration, her sadness, her anger, her normal emotions at the situation, because others can't handle them. Do you want her going into her teenage and adult years with the mentality that she should make things easier for others by pushing all of her emotions down because they don't matter as much?", "INFO:\nHave you done anything to give your niece attention, 1:1 time or even a way for her to get time with her mum or dad?", "Yes you are a HUGE asshole. You basically told this child that she doesn't matter. Wtf. YTA I hope you and your sis arent planning on having her take care of him when you all get old because you're causing huge resentments. Do you want her to not talk to any of you at all when she turns 18? Because thats where youre headed.", "YTA\n\nYour niece seems like a kid who's fed up with being second to her brother all the time and this was just another moment where her brother was the front of attention.\n\nEven calling you upset, you could hear BOTH parents trying to calm her brother down, disregarding her upset on HER birthday.\n\nYour comment was neither helpful nor needed.\n\nI feel tremendously sad for your niece.", "YTA", "YTA - She is 12 years old and nobody in her family actually cares how hard all this is on her. It's incredibly hard for her and you should show more empathy. Sounds like your partner is an absolute star though.", "YTA and so are her parents. They\u2019re failing this girl", "Yta she's 12 and has the right to have emotions and have her needs met - it's incredibly damaging for children to be sidelined or made into carers for their high needs siblings", "YTA. I see you have responded to other commenters conveying the issues for your niece, so I don't want to be harsh. However, your comments to her were unnecessary and damaging. You owe her a sincere apology. Yes, your sister and BiL are struggling, but they are adults, your niece despite the fact that she has been doubtlessly expected to be more mature than her years is still a child and needs someone on her side. Because despite their best intentions your sister and BiL are emotionally neglecting your niece. She needs an adult who will be there emotionally for her. If you really want to help, be that adult", "NAH. I think its less you shouldn't have said it and more theres no purpose to saying it. A 12 year old on their birthday, who probably told her classmates about cupcakes, is likely not in the right headspace to hear that so her, in my view, disrespectful. comments are really more just her wanting to defend her understandable emotions. Was her reaction juvenile? Yes. But she is a juvenile so its an appropriate reaction. Your point is right, just whats a 12 year old going to do with it in the moment?", "NTA you agreed to replace the cupcakes and asked for some emotional space for your sister in turn. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate or OK for a 12 y/o to label their parents as \u201ccareless\u201d over a mistake like this. You\u2019re a great aunt.", "[deleted]", "NAH, and you saved the day. This is gonna need a follow up conversation, first with the parents and then with the niece - things happen and she has a right to her feelings, and to be upset - maybe you can talk to her about how to handle things.

I need you to help out.\"  I've had that conversation with the 8yo too.\n\nThey're more than old enough to have \"reasonably mature conversations\".\n\nIt also helps develop some level of resilience and perspective.

There\u2019s enough shitty judgement in this world.Auntie just told niece to lower the temperature a little, didn\u2019t speak to her so harshly, that\u2019s what aunts and uncles should do, step in to help, do nice things for nieces and nephews, but also leverage that more fun relationship to support their positive emotional development and a healthy dynamic for parent/child.", "Say no more, I've got a pretty good idea of what happened and I'm sorry for your loss", "YTA. Her brother sabotaged her day and instead of comforting her, the parents are solely focused on the brother.

That poor girl just wants to get the love and attention she deserves for once and everyone in her life that she vents to or looks to for comfort makes it all about her brother.

Who is making her life easier?", "Everyone has covered why YTA but as a cupcake lover and a lesbian I just have to add: your partner is amazing. Listen to her.

That blows. Hard. Have some compassion.", "YTA\n\nShe is a kid, she should treat others with respect, but she has absolute zero obligation to bend over just to make her parents' lives easier.

Mom was a nurse, dad did manual labor, and they had grandma (who was in her 80\u2019s) stay up with him at night. They had a daughter a year or two younger who just fucked off basically. She was always at a friends house because she didn\u2019t want to be home and was getting into a lot of trouble in school. \n\nDad was the only one who gave her any type of attention and mom was furious he wouldn\u2019t help with the high needs child. Needless to say they divorced. They lived together, but dad would go out with the daughter or take her to friends houses because home life was bad for her. I hope she\u2019s doing better now, she would be an adult by now.", "YTA. Your niece doesn't need to be a robot devoid of wants or emotion simply because she has a special needs brother.

Then her parents don\u2019t even take the time to console her, they are both busy calming down the same brother that started this mess. She\u2019s left to deal with her own overwhelming emotions on her own, which is not an easy task for a 12 yo. Therefore she calls you, which is honestly a very brave and smart thing to do for a young kid.

She starts getting bullied? A boy touches her without her consent?  Well, don't tell mom and dad, it'll just make their lives harder. Sure, it's not what you *meant*, but she's a child, and that's how she could take it. \n\nDo not parentify children. Do not expect them to act like adults.

Your sister is spending her daughters birthday at a doctors office, and her husband had surgeries booked. All your niece wanted was cupcakes, a happy birthday, and a \u2018sweetie I\u2019m so sorry, of course you\u2019re upset\u2019.

While I don\u2019t have a ND sibling, I was invalidated constantly by the adults in my life as a child. I never forgot that, and am no contact with every single one of them.

Your partner deserves a standing ovation however.", "Gentle YTA - I can tell that you love your niece. I have three kids, the older two are 12 and 13. I totally get your knee-jerk reaction to use your own adult perspective in your response to her. But as other commenters have said, your niece's world revolves around her brother. Finally, on her birthday, she had some special attention paid to her and was excited to be the star of the show at school, even for a little while. But once again, her brother's needs and behavior took center stage. So yes, you shouldn't have said that. But use this as a learning experience and continue to be the loving, attentive presence that you already have demonstrated you are. Keep being an important adult in her life. Make every effort you can to single her out for dedicated attention. She needs you desperately.\n\nETA: I forgot to explain that the reason I mentioned my own kids' ages is because so many times they get angry over things that seem irrational, and their responses to any type of conversation around the issues seem to be totally self-absorbed and illogical to an adult.", "YTA, don't tell her to repress her own feelings for the sake of her brother, she gets that enough from her own parents. She needs someone to support her, not to tell her to suck it up cause her parents are focused on her brother. If you want to help, take her out to celebrate her, do something fun that's just for her alone. Show her that you see her and she is valid.", "YTA, you took an unnecessary jab at a justifiably upset 12 year old. That type of language breeds resentment and teaches her that she matters less than her brother and to just be quiet when things happen so as not to stress out her parents even if she's suffering. \n\n She was right, it was a careless mistake. Today it was cupcakes, tomorrow it could be something much worse that he gets into.", "YTA. Apologize to your niece for what you said, reassure her that her emotions and needs matter and that you understand that what you said was horrible.\n\nShe is not responsible for making things easy for her parents. She's a kid, she needs to be a kid", "YTA. It sucks that your nephew has obvious issues, but you don't lay that on a child. She is devastated and everyone at home is comforting the child that caused it, and she called you for support and comfort, and you took the opportunity to criticize her. You blew the chance to let this little girl know that someone in her life would put her first.", "YTA.  Please consider that your niece is neglected. Her needs will always come last, and it's not fair.  Can you take her to do special things without her brother? Can you invite her for sleepovers so that she can get a break from her horribly stressful life at home?", "YTA. As I\u2019m sure many other comments have said, the siblings of a high needs disabled sibling often get sorta neglected. It\u2019s not that the parents aren\u2019t doing the best they can, but it\u2019s like the world forgets they are also a child with the needs of a child. They can\u2019t behave like an adult just because the parents don\u2019t have the capacity to care for all their kids equally. You could\u2019ve just said \u201cwe\u2019re taking care of it, I\u2019m so sorry this happened\u201d and leave it at that. Remembering when I was 12, I did not have the emotional maturity to sit back and go \u201cyknow what, my parents have a lot on their plate I should stop crying and act like everything\u2019s okay.\u201d When I was 12 my grandmother was dying of cancer and the lack of my mom\u2019s attention during that time, while completely understood and I cannot imagine what she was going through, was extremely damaging. And that was just a couple years, not my whole life.", "YTA. Your niece\u2019s feelings are valid. She is a child not an adult.", "YTA, I get that your sister and BIL are going through the shit right now with your nephew, but that doesn\u2019t mean that your niece can\u2019t get upset about her plans for her birthday being screwed up. Also what\u2019s with the locking cabinets? Has it been an issue where the nephew has done similar stuff like this in the past?", "I understand where you're coming from but I just feel too bad for your niece. She's being openly neglected by her parents and probably never gets heard and her feelings are rarely acknowledged, so she waits for her birthday to celebrate with her friends who probably do pay attention to her and it gets ruined because someone ate the cupcakes. I bet she was looking forward to that and now she was placed in a stressful situation where she didn't know if it would have been fixed on time.\n\nMy recommendation if you can and want (because it's not really your responsibility tbh) take the girl out for a girl's day and celebrate her birthday and give her a big hug. She needs to have her feelings acknowledged too and it's OK to be temperamental from time to time. I hope she gets counseling or some sort of professional help during her teenage years, she may not be specials needs like her brother but she matters too.", "YTA for how you worded it. \n\nYour niece Likely feels pushed to the side a lot because of her brother and you just enforced the idea that needs to happen because of her brother.\n\nYou could\u2019ve said people make mistakes and it\u2019s good to extend Grace to people who forget simple things sometimes because we all do it. \n\nI\u2019m sure that was your intention, but there was no need to add on top of that how much work her parents put in for her brother. She knows that already.", "Your poor poor niece, you've just taken away from her the one person she probably felt safe enough to vent with. \nShe's only 12 and already coping with so much coming behind her brother in everything", "YTA. She\u2019s a kid. The parents have 2 kids. They need to get their shit together.", "I am glad you and your partner were able to help her out. She is 12, so at the moment she needed you to agree with her. Having a conversation with her at another time about what her parents are going through is fine. However, you don't want her looking back at the exceptions she had to make as a kid and resent her brother or parents. YTA but not a big one", "YTA. I repressed my negative emotions for years because I didn\u2019t want to make things harder for my parents, who were always tired and burnt out and angry from dealing with my sisters. It was real bad for me and has caused some long term problems, I ended up not getting the attention and help that I needed from my parents.

That poor kid.", "YTA\n\nShe is only 12. I am sure there are many times that your niece has bottled up her feelings because she is trying to not make life hard on her parents. Having a sibling with such high needs means she is overlooked a lot. Let her be mad. She\u2019s entitled to her emotions. You should be someone she trusts enough to be honest with. Instead you chastise her. Do better.", "YTA. What you said was out of line.", "YTA. Your niece was upset, and frankly it is reasonable for her to be upset at that age about that situation. You keep talking to her like this, you will no longer be close. Be careful. She is also living every day with the nephew and getting less of her parents as a result.", "YTA - she's already had to put up with a lot with her brother. Her birthday is her one day that belongs you her and she should beer celebrated", "YTA - I get that you mean well, but her parents have TWO children. I\u2019m low support needs autistic, and I was parentified at a young age because my mother put her energy into my more difficult siblings. She shouldn\u2019t have to feel as though her feelings are less valid just because the adults in her life aren\u2019t able to show up for her at the same level they show her siblings. She\u2019s allowed to feel frustrated\u2026I mean it\u2019s her birthday. If there\u2019s one day she should be self centered a little, it\u2019s then.", "YTA, they have TWO children and need to respect the needs and feelings of both of them.", "YTA in a big way. Keep reinforcing that girl\u2019s feelings that her brother is more important, go on!", "YTA, your niece is always treated as less important by her parents and she calls you to vent only to be told not to complain. Seriously? Poor kid probably feels like an afterthought to her parents every day and the one person she turns to for comfort basically tells her just be quiet and get in line.", "YTA. I am an aunt to 2 nieces and 1 nephew. My nephew has higher needs than his sisters and he is ND. I would never *ever* invalidate either of my nieces' feelings on their brother and the attention he gets. Your niece is a child whose entire childhood is made about someone else. She wants ONE day to be about her, and her parents completely dropped the ball and she's left feeling stressed and upset because of their actions. Because of your nephew's actions. She's not an adult, and therefore, cannot process emotions like an adult. She is just as important as him, and shouldn't be treated as less because she does not have the same needs he does.\n\nAs an aunt, YOU need to work harder for your niece. You need to be on HER side because it doesn't seem like anyone else is. Not everything should be about her brother, and she needs a person who makes things about her. She's not getting that from her parents. You need to step up. She NEEDS support.", "Plenty of people answered already.\nIMO technical YTA although of course you seem to want to do good.\nIt also seems you take interest in hearing what people have to say on the matter. Hard situation all around but as stated, please take into account that your niece may be a (heavy) collateral damage there. She did not ask or deserve the situation more than her parents or her brother, but she may lose even more in a sense (a family, a purpose, \u2026) if she gets pushed aside and feels like she doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nBest of luck", "YTA for saying this on her birthday of all days. I'm sure that every damn day she has her wants and needs put on the back burner for her brother. It was her birthday for crying out loud. The ONE day she was waiting for all year.

Brother ate her entire birthday cake the day of the birthday and she had no cake well oh well it\u2019s just a cake. At every turn she was told to suck it up. Her brother couldn\u2019t be held accountable and her parents were saints trying so hard to help him. Well you know what it left her feeling less than. She never felt wanted or needed or like she deserved anything. When her boyfriend in college started to beat her up you know what she did she sucked it up and put up with it. Your niece needs 1 person in her corner to help her and listen to her vent. She needs one person to tell her she\u2019s enough. I wish I could tell my friend that but unfortunately thanks to her boyfriend getting drunk one night I\u2019ll never be able to. Be the one to put your niece first cause her parents aren\u2019t.", "YTA, all she did was say they were careless and you're making it sound like she's being a burden on them or being insanely and irrationally critical of them. She's allowed to be upset and make a remark like that. All you'll do by saying that is make her feel like she can't criticize them or even just vent and be as open with you or it'll be like an attack on her family as a result of her being too immature. So making a kid feel bad for having feelings", "YTA. This really hurt to read:\n\n\"please lay off her parents that their lives are hard enough with her brother that she shouldn't make things any more difficult for them bc they're so burnt out and overwhelmed.\"\n\nYou basically told her that she doesn't have the right to her feelings or for her own individual attention and care from her parents just because they have a high needs child.

I developed very severe CPTSD from this all.", "Mild YTA. Your niece is likely constantly told that she has to be the bigger person, the rational, self-sacrificing sibling because her brother is ND.

She knows her brother can\u2019t control these behaviors). In the heat of the moment, she need someone to validate her feelings and admit that this sucks for her.", "You are wonderful for providing a solution to the cupcakes but YTA for comment to niece on her birthday. I actually am so impressed that she blamed her parents and not her brother. I would have kicked off at 12 if I was left cakeless for going to school on my birthday. It matters and it matters a lot to a 12 year old. I have a severely disabled person in my family and it did compromise what I could do with my daughter and she knew it was just the circumstances but I didn\u2019t invalidate how cross she would get about the unfairness of the situation and moved hell and high water to make sure we had individual time. What I hated and she has told me she hated too we\u2019re the well meaning but patronising relatives who would say to her \u2018you must be a good help to your mum\u2019 when no other child in the family was told to be a good help or adopt a nursing or carer role. The ones we loved were the relatives who would say. We are taking care today so you and daughter can go do something nice or we are going x place today - would daughter like to come?  Maybe offer something like that to your sister so your niece can have individual time with her parents and try not to say to niece to think of others. She gets it but she can still sound off when the situation is rubbish.", "YTA.\n\nYou meant well for your sister. But it's so emotionally damaging for a child to have no space to express their feelings because they are seen as \"lesser than\" the feelings of their siblings with high needs or their stressed parents. Offer your niece a place for her to express herself, and your sister's family probably needs more help.\n\nAs someone who grew up with a disabled sister, I'm NC and LC with my parents because of this.", "So she\u2019s not allowed to have feelings because her brother is high needs? She\u2019s also a child with big feelings and she shouldn\u2019t have to bottle them up for her parent\u2019s sake.

She is too, and she's a child. Why should she have even fewer opportunities to be a child and have her feelings and needs attended to for the sake of her parents? \n\nIt was a cruel suggestion. It would have been insensitive to say to an adult who was emotional and rightfully upset that other people's mistakes had ruined their birthday plans. You said it to a child who, on top of her birthday treats being ruined, has had to constantly manage her expectations of a normal childhood because of her brother. \n\nShe doesn't need to suck it up. She needs support from other people who aren't as drained as her parents. That's you. You shouldn't have admonished her for daring to act like an upset 12 year old.

She is eight years old. She needs to feel loved, listened to, and know that her feelings are valid and she is not second-class due to circumstances beyond her control. It is not her responsibility to bottle up her emotions. She is a child, her parents ae adults; it is their job to ensure ALL of their kids are being cared for in all aspects of life, it is not their second grader's job to manage their feelings for them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide note; what are you doing to help? When my son was initially ID'd as having higher needs, my parents flew out to give us respite and help around the house and with both the kids. You bought cupcakes, okay, cool.

Do you hear yourself?  She is freakin 12 years old and couldn\u2019t have one thing for her birthday?   Wow.  Way to go Uncle.  NOT.   Why are both parents up with the brother at the same time?  Can they not take turns?  Can they not hire help so they can take a nap? Can you not go over once weekly so they can get some sleep?  I feel for this child being told to grow up.  There are so many options to research for assistance.  The nephew is 8.  Is he not in school?  Mom cannot sleep while he is in school?   And be up at night when he is home?  Sounds like mom and dad need to work together to adjust their schedules as best they can.  I know all this is easier said than done, but to put the onus on a child is wrong.  It is up to the adults to figure it out.", "YTA. She is a child. It is not her job to support her parents. THEY need to support HER. She\u2019s not getting the emotional care and support she needs at home so she reached out to another family member she thought she could trust with her feelings and instead had them invalidated and was made to feel bad about being a human being with needs. This poor child is in the unenviable position of being the sibling to another with high needs. It\u2019s very common knowledge that these kids are frequently neglected either emotionally, physically, or both when in this situation. Her parents being worn out is an explanation- not an excuse. They don\u2019t get a free pass on failing to adequately support their child and you\u2019re the YTA for even implying they should with your comment.", "YTA, if they can't handle the little boy, take him to a place where they can help him, they're forgetting about the older one and you go and tell him to hold on, the poor girl has a shitty aunt and parents", "YTA. Helping with the cupcakes was nice of you. But it's not a child's responsibility to help their parents from burnout and the unspoken message here was \"Your parents are barely hanging on and you are responsible for fixing it.\" This is a double whammy because it's scary for a child to be told that their parents, on whom they are dependent for survival, cannot be relied upon. And it is unfair to put the burden of parents' well-being on the child. If parents are reaching a breaking point, they need to sort that shit out.", "YTA \n  \nHonestly, as someone who doesn't think that abortion should be used willy nilly, if my wife and I learn during gestation that the pregnancy will result in a high need child, I think my options will be to either not have any other children (I've always wanted a large family) or to abort.\n  \nIt's not that these children aren't deserving of life, but if I already have young children, I'm not going to make *their* lives about the new sibling. If this were my only child I would still love it with all my heart.\n  \nI've seen way too many posts about how these children end up without proper care and dying shortly after their parents because their siblings resent them and refuse to accept responsibility for their care.", "Yta.

My neuro typical child has an equal right to have a hard time and struggle as my autistic child. His big feelings are just as important as my autistic daughter's. A lot of NT children develop \"glass child syndrome\" where they feel like they become see through because their disabled sibling need so much extra care. \n\nAs a parent it is hard to juggle the needs of multiple children, not to mention when one is ND or otherwise disabled. You do not want to accidentally contribute to your neice feeling less important than her brother. \n\nI would have said something like \"im so sorry that happened. I'm sure parents just forgot because brother was struggling so much. Do not worry, I will help you.\" Just the part about not adding extra stress was unnecessary.", "YTA, but I appreciate your viewpoint. You clearly care about everyone involved by getting replacements and having so much sympathy for your sister and BIL. I also appreciate that your comment to your neice is aiming to help her have some perspective of the situation- it's only cupcakes, right? I think however you also need to broaden your own perspective.\n\nYour partner is right. She's not only a kid, who would find it hard enough to process this situation anyway, but she's a sibling to a high needs child. That means she's likely receiving no-where near the levels of attention or specific care that she would ideally be receiving. You said yourself that her parents are hanging by a thread. How do you think that is for her?\n\nThis was a rare moment that was supposed to be about her and only her. From her eyes, her parents have failed to allow her to have that moment, because despite having to spend so much more of their attention on her brother, that attention fell short when it came to protecting her special things. She likely feels that she can't have anything. In that moment, she was looking to you for validation that she is important and that there are people who are willing to put her first. Her birthday likely feels like the only day where she can ask for things to be about her and only her, and she was left disappointed by the people that are supposed to provide that for her. Your sister and BIL are trying their best, but for a sibling of a high needs child it likely isn't enough. \n\nWhen you said that she was making their lives more difficult by being angry with them, what she likely heard in that moment is that her feelings and needs and special days are not important enough. She isn't allowed to be angry, because her parents are doing their best. She needs to be okay with being disappointed, because they have to focus on someone else. It's crippling for her self-esteem.\n\nThis is definitely not going to be the first or last time her things or special moments have been affected by her brother. She needs an ally. I think you have good intentions but that message to her was a miss.", "YTA. She is already in danger of constantly being sidelined because of having a nd sibling and now she can't even have her birthday being just about her. To then tell her she is wrong to be emotional about it is wrong and the comment about it making things more difficult is just icky. Her needs are just as important and should be treated as such.", "YTA. It's great that you and your partner were able to help get the cupcakes, but it is not your role to tell her to lighten up on her Mom. Do not get in the middle between parents and their kid. You risk your sister blowing up at you for parenting her daughter.", "YTA.... she is a person too with feelings and it seems she is being pushed aside for her brother. Yes, he has more needs but it isn't fair to her either. He ate the cupcakes. Her parents can't drop it off cause he has a appointment....dad doesn't have time for her and SAHM is only staying home for him. Your wrong to ask her to understand more and more. She will go NC with her parents if it doesn't change", "YTA\n\nIf she was 18 then her reaction would be over the top. She a kid. A kid who probably doesn't get enough attention because of her brother and her one special thing for her bday was cupcakes that no adult seemed to care got destroyed.", "YTA she is a child with needs that are not being met. It is not her fault her brother has more complex needs, and his needs do not negate hers. But you told her that, that as a child she has to put her needs aside because her brother deserves her parents attention more than her because of his complex needs. She will grow up to resent you, her brother, and her parents.", "YTA and I'm glad some of these comments have given you a reality check. Absolutely infuriating. OP, it seems like you've accepted judgement, but are you going to actually take steps to sort out this situation?", "YTA she is entitled to her feelings and you told her to mind herself because her parents have their hands full.  They have 2 kids and can\u2019t forget that.", "YTA. Her brother is literally ruining her life (the reason doesn't matter, he's still ruining her life), she gets no attention from her parents and she can't even resort to a safe adult to vent about her feelings. Seriously, oh no the poor parents with their poor messed up son! They chose to be a parent, which can mean sometimes parenting a kid that's got disabilities or other struggles. This poor girl didn't sign up for any of it. I wouldn't be surprised if she cuts off the whole family once she grows up. I bet she'll be happier", "YTA. You invalidated your niece, and her extremely valid, feelings. Her parents may be burnt out, but this is in no way, your niece\u2019s problem. She was right to be frustrated, and upset, despite it being an accident. \n\nI can tell you from personal experience, that my friend cut contact with his parents and family, as soon as he turned 18. He was the NT older child, with a younger brother who was high needs ND. My friend was pushed to the side, forced to grow up before he should, had his emotions invalidated/ignored, and told much the same as your niece. His parents did not have the energy to meet his needs when he was a child, and his family sucked too. He now has 2 children of his own, who will never meet anyone from his family. His parents had the audacity to assume that my friend would become the caregiver to his younger brother, when they got too old. He laughed in their faces, and had them escorted from his property by the police. This was their last meeting, 10+ years ago now.  \n\nI\u2019d be wary, about damaging the relationship between parents and child further.", "YTA. That was so inappropriate of you.", "She's 12. It was her birthday. Those cupcakes obviously meant a great deal to her. She was trying to express her feelings, and you pretty much told her to shut it because her parents were having a tough time. Which I don't disagree with, but she just wanted a space to vent. \n\nYTA.", "YTA in this situation. OP, you still sound like a good person and you clearly care about your niece and her family. That said, you basically told a twelve year old to suppress her feelings for the sake of others. \n\nYou probably aren\u2019t the first person in her life to do this and won\u2019t be the last. If your niece lets this lesson sink in, she may begin to believe that she doesn\u2019t matter and learn to not value herself or her emotional needs. \n\nYour niece trusts you enough to call you when she is upset. You are already the aunt who can arrange emergency replacement cupcakes, make sure you are also the aunt she can safely express her emotions to. With everything going on in your nieces house, she likely needs you to keep being the adult in her life who isn\u2019t hanging on by a thread.", "YTA.\n\nYour poor niece is disregarded by her family,  and she's being told that it's nbd.", "YTA\n\nYour niece\u2019s needs have come second for probably the last 8 years, since she was 4 and her brother was born. While we as adults can understand that, she is 12 and it\u2019s hard! And she doesn\u2019t have the coping skills that you and her parents have. And if they have to lock up the food then yes, the mistake was careless. Even though it\u2019s understandable, it was a special treat for a special occasion and it stinks. And in the aftermath while she was upset she had to turn to you for comfort because both of her parents were occupied with her brother! Her needs came second once again! It sucks! She has every right to be upset.\n\nLay off your niece, her life is hard enough with her parents and brother and you shouldn\u2019t make things harder for her when her needs are neglected and her feelings ignored.", "YTA\n\nYou just told a child, who is probably also burnt out and overwhelmed by her brothers needs, not to feel her feelings or complain because it makes her parents life hard. What kind of lesson is that. She deserves just as much space as her brother does, she should not have to smoother herself to make her parents lives easier. \n\nIt is up to the grown ups to learn how to care for their children equally, not for the child to take the hit to make it easier for them.", "YTA, idk if you have ever experienced this but that one singular comment is gonna cause a LOT of issues down the road. Example:\n\nI am a single child, growing up my life was hell, school was hell, I was bullied every day, and to top it off I was dealing with severe ADHD and all the problems that came with it. My dad was working an extremely high stress job and would take it out on me by yelling at me in the evenings. I felt I was the root cause of the problems in my household, and to an extent, it was true. I developed a habit of retreating into myself to cope, I stopped talking to my parents about things and did my best to please them. However, through my mental health problems I often lashed out from all of my bottled emotions. I was that kid who had big reactions to things since I wasn't ever taught how to properly process my emotions. I inherited my dad's explosive anger and every night my parents and I would have screaming matches. \n\nTelling a child to not \"make life any harder for their mom\" is like telling them THEY are the reason for the stress and difficulties in their home. This *will* cause her to step back and think about her role in the family dynamics. \n\nI don't believe you said that out of malice and my comment isn't to make you feel bad, I just wanted to point out how she likely interpreted it. Please keep an eye on her, birthdays are special. It's the one day that we get to be selfish and think about ourselves. Speaking as someone who was just recently mostly ignored by her family on her birthday, it does matter. It does make a difference to feel special. Maybe not to you but it does matter.\n\nIt sounds like everyone in that house just needs a break. Being a surgeon is hard enough but throw a difficult child in the mix and it's a recipe for disaster. Nobody is at fault here and it seems like everyone is lashing out as a way to vent their stress. I feel for everyone in this situation", "YTA and go apologize to your niece right now, or else she rightfully stop talking to you since you're just as dismissive towards her & her feelings as her parents are now, in the future andfor years her whole life. You messed up, you fucked up really badly in this situation.", "YTA. This is a 12 year old with a father who works too much to spend time with her and a mother who has to give all her attention to her other child. From what you wrote, it sounds like she was reasonably upset considering her age and called you to try to fix the situation. Was she storming around the house breaking things? Was she berating her parents with insults? What the hell is she doing to make her parents\u2019 lives harder? Existing? Dang, you blew this opportunity to support your niece. Cupcakes are nice, but she could really use a adult in her life that empathizes with her rather than considering her to be an obstacle.", "YTA and from your comments it looks like you\u2019re realizing this. Please try and spend some time with your niece or talk to her parents and see if you could watch your nephew for a few hours so your niece can have mom and dad time. She needs someone in her corner who she can rely on when she\u2019s not feeling important. Her feelings are valid and important and make sure she knows that.", "YTA this will be just another thing in her life that\u2019s not gone right that her parents having paid attention too. She will constantly be being put on the back burner because of her brother needs.", "A soft YTA. You don't know what it is like to be the big sibling of a disabled kid so you cannot relate to her. Also, she is 12 y/o. Every 12 y/o would be upset about their birthday cupcakes being smashed.\nIf I were you, I'd look into the term \"glass child\", cause that's what your niece is. This is coming from the big sis of a heavily disabled boy. Good luck to all of you.", "I don't feel like you're the asshole, but your niece is definitely not a priority right now to her parents and probably really hasn't been for a long time. She really just needs her feelings validated and to feel cared for. \n\nIf she isn't already in therapy it would probably be a good idea. Sit and talk to her, ask her what she needs. Be there for her and support her. That's honestly what she wants more than anything is someone to show they care.", "I do agree with all the comments saying the kid is in a crappy position and probably under a lot of strain herself, and not responsible for her parents' mental health - but generally speaking I don't think 12 is too young to be urged to give your parents an easier time of it if they're struggling, you need to realise your parents are individuals in their own right at some point. \n\nGiven her circumstances it probably wasn't the right thing to say, she's likely been robbed of enough time enjoying being \"just a kid\" as it is. But generally speaking I think it's a fair comment to give to a 12 year old if worded kindly. So given the context probably YTA, but I can understand where you're coming from and hopefully you can approach it with her again with this context in mind and make things right with her.", "Ouch.  This judgment hurts.  But YTA.  \n\nLook, you are a fantastic aunt and sister.  And stepping in on your niece's birthday with the cupcakes - kudos.  Wild applause.  And I hope that's what she remembers when she looks back on this, as opposed to her 12th birthday being the one where the cupcakes didn't taste as good as they should have because her aunt hammered home that her brother is the child that matters, and she's expected to act like an adult now and back off her parents because her needs just aren't as important.  \n\nThat's not what you meant to say.  But that could very well be what she heard, and you were wrong.  I get it. You're having your sister's back, and hey, nothing wrong with that.  But your sister is the parent here.  She signed on for this.  Your niece didn't.  And negating her feelings was wrong.  \n\nMy question is, do you live in a place where your sister and her husband can somehow get respite care for your nephew?  I'm worried that something is going to give if they don't get some help and some sleep soon (Like somebody's mental health), and I know that those services are available in my area.  No doubt in my mind your sister is hanging by a thread - maybe getting some outside help would be a game changer.  \n\nHugs to all of you.  I know it's tough, and knowing they aren't in this alone has to be huge for your sister's family.  That's why the judgment was tough, because I believe you're doing your best, too!", "YTA but in a nice way. She's a kid. Her feelings are real. She probably is ignored by the parents because the sibling sucks the life out of them. Just smile and be there for her.", "The niece is just as important as the nephew.\nYTA. Each have their own issues.\nTelling her this will cause her to resent her brother and parents.", "YTA. \n\nYour niece is 12. It\u2019s her freaking birthday, the one day of the year when she should absolutely be her parent\u2019s priority, and she wasn\u2019t. Instead of having something that she was looking forward to, she got the gift of disappointment and being put on the back burner yet again like every other day of her life. \n\nShe called the one adult who had yet to fail her, and you almost, almost stepped up to the task. If you had stopped at empathizing with her and making the cupcakes happen, you would have the hero of the day. \n\nInstead, you told the birthday girl whose parents just clearly communicated to her that her needs don\u2019t matter, even on her birthday, to continue sucking it up so that the people who continually put her at the bottom of the priority list don\u2019t feel guilty for abdicating their parental responsibilities to their daughter. You chose to tell the ONE person in this situation who has every reason to feel hurt and angry to swallow her feelings so she don\u2019t make the people who caused her hurt to feel a twinge of guilt for failing her. And you preemptively chastised her for what, having valid feelings? God forbid her parents experience the natural consequences of their shitty parenting. Good call in telling the 12 year old to suck it up on her birthday so her tormentors don\u2019t feel guilt. Every 12 year old girl needs to hear \u201cyour feelings don\u2019t matter, even though you\u2019re the victim. You will always come second to your brother, and it is your responsibility as a small child to shoulder the emotional burden of two grown-ass adults.\u201d I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll help prepare her for healthy adult relationships. \n\nHopefully your wife can be the one trustworthy adult in your niece\u2019s life. She sure needs somebody who won\u2019t kick her while she\u2019s down.", "YTA who just reaffirmed in her mind that she will never be anybodys number 1 priority and that the needs of her brother and parents will always be more important than her.

That girl is probably always taking a backseat to her little brother. She always has to be understanding. Her needs and feelings are just as important but she\u2019s constantly made to feel like they aren\u2019t. And you effectively confirmed that feeling for her.", "YTA. You adults have decades on her. You don\u2019t make her life harder. It\u2019s not up to her to be the adult in any situation. She should be commended for behaving well not admonished for acting her age on her birthday. It might be easy to take out your frustrations on a child but it doesn\u2019t make it right. I also don\u2019t see how it helps her parents situation to be mean to her.", "NTA. No matter what anyone says, know that you\u2019re in the right/clear. She is just a kid, but to call her own parents careless is just rude and insulting. I\u2019m sure she struggles with attention deprivation but at the same time, trying to get her to understand that her parents are struggling isn\u2019t wrong. \n\n\nYou didn\u2019t even say anything extreme. Just \u201cplease try not to give your parents a hard time, they made a mistake.\u201d In fact, it helps her process things. You told her that her parents care, they\u2019re just goin through it rn. \n\nEveryone saying YTA doesn\u2019t know what day to day in their house is like.

And it's understandable that shed have a negative reaction and blame people around her. And she's not wrong.\n\nBut she's capable of learning to extend grace in situations like this.

I do, however, have three very young siblings who require a lot of attention. Many times this leaves me feeling left out and less cared about and like my problems aren't as important. So I can see where the niece is coming from. Op even said that the niece had every right to be upset. All that op asked was for the niece to lay of her parents for it. That isn't unreasonable. The situation was fixed and just because she is upset doesn't mean she has the right to cause more problems for her already overburdened parents. It probably didn't feel good to hear though and op could have suggested a solution to the feeling forgotten by the parents problem. Op could have said that she could watch the nephew for a while so the niece could have a talk with her parents about the whole situation so her feelings could be heard.", "NTA!!

The way to do that is to give your niece a safe space to vent with you and sympathize with her feelings.", "YTA\n\nAs soon as your niece is old enough she is going to run far, far away from all of her family that told her that her brother's needs were more important.", "NTA. Unless you were mean about it all you did was tell a kid something they were DEFINITELY old enough to hear. She\u2019s a kid, yeah, but 12 is old enough to understand, or learn, about burdens and responsibilities etc. When I was 12 I understood that my parents were broke and unhappy. I figured it out through context and being told things. Like that we couldn\u2019t afford that new Barbie I wanted. And it was IMPORTANT for me to understand. Because my younger sister, at age 9, actually WAS too young to really understand and I could tell it broke my dad\u2019s heart to tell us no when we wanted something - especially when it wasn\u2019t very expensive. By knowing I, at least, could stop asking for things I didn\u2019t need. I could gently dissuade my sister from asking for the more expensive option \u201cyeah that one is super cool but this [less expensive] one is even better because\u2026\u201d. Doing that wasn\u2019t my responsibility as a child, but it was an important part of growing up and becoming an empathetic person.\n\nThe point is that 12 is old enough to understand that her parents aren\u2019t perfect, her brother didn\u2019t mean to upset her, and being mad and laying into them (which I\u2019m guessing based off the context happened) doesn\u2019t help. Of course no one should expect her to just flip a switch and suddenly not be mad or upset about it but often (as much as we just want someone to validate us) we NEED the reminder that while like sucks, people are not vindictively going out of their way to make it suck (well\u2026not in this case anyway). You gave her a gentle reminder that shit happens. Her brother is gonna keep being high needs, her parents will still be burned out, and the only one who can make her feel better about the difficulties involved in all that in the end is gonna be her.

That was what you should do.\n\nYou clearly love your niece.\n\nI suggest you do some reading and listening from children whose siblings had high needs growing up. Your niece needs you.

And that means letting her vent and letting her understand that she is loved and she matters.\n\nSoon she will be old enough to get into real trouble, with school, boys, drugs, etc. Please don't teach her her feelings are something to be pushed down. It will set her up for abusive relationships and poor mental health, which lead to poor choices. \n\nHer parents need to get help in so they have more support.

My parents actually did their absolute best while raising us and tried to make sure that we got their equal attention, yet I can still recall so many times where my own feelings and wants were invalidated in favour of his.

Probely will be asked to be her brothers caregiver in the future instead of having a future for herself. Most kids leave, cut contact and never look back in these situations.

It may be hard to find a balance but you shouldn't tell a child they have to suck it up and shive down their feelings.  Basically what you told her is her brother matters more than her. Her feelings are secondary. Might not be what you meant but what a 12 year child heard you say. On her birthday no less. \n\nI truly hope her parents apologized to her for not making sure her brother couldn't get to the cupcakes. That was bad parenting for both their children.", "By making your niece the invisible child, the family is ruining the potential future relationships.  She will never trust anyone in the family to have her back and is either going to become fiercely independent, or fall in with a bad crowd who give her validation when she acts out.

It sucks, you spend your whole childhood ignored, neglected, no one cares about your wants or your feelings or your problems.

She\u2019s allowed to be upset on *her birthday* when, once again, her brother is the centre of attention. Her brother is probably coddled because the parents are exhausted and she probably gets zero attention and is always, always watching her parents give him whatever he wants just to keep him from spiralling. Autistic kids know how to play their parents too, by the way. This is a great example. He knew the cupcakes weren\u2019t for him. If he didn\u2019t, he\u2019s so disabled he should have live-in support. So he knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to eat them, did, and now his parents are consoling HIM.

If the parents are too exhausted to properly parent or deal with his autism, they need, again, live-in support, or the kid needs to live somewhere he can get the support he needs.

This probably isn't the first time they've been told to just put up with the younger kid's misbehaviour, this is a pattern, an ugly one.\n\nMy parents did something similar, and it was *years* before I could unlearn the real message they had taught me - that everyone else's needs and wants were to come before my own.

No doubt her parents are trying their best, but she also should be allowed to be angry and feel slighted.  Suppressing her feelings on it isn't healthy.  \n\nMaybe instead of telling her to excuse their mistakes, you could be the person she can vent about it to?

You effectively parentified her, which speaking from bitter experience here, is not something you want to do to a child. It stops them from being children, forces them to squash down their own needs and feelings and sets them up for a lifetime of anxiety and stress. At 12 she can't handle that kind of pressure and she can't explain how that makes her feel. She probably already feels responsible in someway for how the family is coping. I would suspect it's probably gnawing a huge hole in the pit of her stomach reach and every day. Reinforcing that feeling will just do more damage. \n\nSecondly it's not easy growing up in a family where do much time, resources and effort goes towards one family member. Siblings in such a family often end up suffering from glass child syndrome. A term used to describe how they are seen by everyone around them.

I would have felt like a huge weight was lifted. Maybe I wouldn't sell be in therapy at 38 years old trying to deal with it all.

Later, you can talk about how their parents didn't let them down on purpose, are doing their best, etc. etc. But \"you're right to be angry but your parents are trying their best\" isn't nuance a 12-year-old can handle while upset, and all they'll hear is that their feelings don't matter.", "This.

But that does not mean that your niece is any less important. You just told her that she is, on her birthday.\n\nHaving a high-needs sibling is already the most invalidating thing around; you are constantly told through your parents' actions that you do not matter. An adult may understand that there are only so many hours in the day, and the high-needs individual will eat up most of that time, but a child cannot. They only internalize that they do not matter.\n\nThis can lead to any number of less-than-optimal outcomes for the NT sibling, including \n\n* resentment for the high-needs sibling (which can come out in any number of ways, from the mostly benign to the downright ugly)\n* getting into abusive relationships (because they have been told they don't matter, being in another relationship like that, or worse, is nothing new)\n* going NC with the family\n\nIt is vitally important that your sister and her husband, as overwhelmed as they are, make time for their daughter. They didn't do that ***on her birthday***, so clearly this isn't something that happens very often, if ever. But if they don't, their relationship with their daughter will never recover. \n\nIf they are unable to get some respite, I implore you to make your niece a priority, so that she has someone in her corner, who cares about her, not just as an afterthought to her brother. She needs someone to love her, and to feel that love. And please, please, never invalidate her emotions about her brother again. They are completely valid.\n\nYou are clearly an empathetic individual; you feel for your sister, who is in dire straits. Please direct some of that empathy towards your niece. She is still developing, and never asked for this. \n\nOn a separate note, I hope that your sister has made alternate arrangements for her son as an adult; it is unlikely in this scenario that her daughter will want to have any part of that as an adult.

Basically, you opened a little window every day and found a small piece of chocolate inside. I asked my parents to let me do it the \"right way\" and open the boxes day by day as it was designed. It was a small ritual that helped me through tough school days. On Day 4, my parents asked me if my sibling could have that day's piece of chocolate. I agreed.  \nBy the time I got home, my calendar was empty. My younger sibling opened all the boxes and ate all the chocolate. I started to cry.  \nMy parents told me to be the better person, that my sibling was just a toddler who didn't know any better, and that it's just chocolate, it can be replaced.   \nThey did replace it, but I never enjoyed it any more. The change disrupted my ritual, the whole point of the calendar was that I get a small reward every day until Christmas, and now suddenly it wasn't accurate any more. I think I actually said screw it and ate the whole thing in one or two settings.  \nMy sibling grew up to be a teen and then adult who still, to this day, struggles with personal boundaries. They would regularly go through my drawers and eat all my snacks to the point where I was hiding them in ridiculous places - and they would be proud of being sneaky enough to find them. I ended up installing two drawers, one for the whole family and one labelled \"this is mine, please only take half\" - as long as the common one was full, I had a chance of actually having something left in the other drawer.   \nOne day, already as a teen, I ordered a large slice of cake for myself that I put in the fridge. Before I left for school, I proactively asked my sibling to only take half because I knew otherwise I would have none left by the time I got home. They still ate the whole thing, and our parents told me to be understanding as \"I should know they struggle with portion control\".  \nI love my sibling. I really do. Our relationship used to be strained both ways, but we're adults now. We reconciled, I went to therapy and figured out I was ND (not diagnosed yet, but hopefully will be), they got diagnosed with autism, and we are slowly figuring it out.

But she's 12, and was in the midst of feeling huge disappointment & facing the very real prospect that she couldn't do this one thing on her birthday. Perhaps it was the only thing her parents had planned for her to mark her birthday, if they struggle so much with their son as you say they do.\n\nConsider what life is like for your niece. She's constantly forced into the background of her own family because she's not neurodivergent. The cupcakes incident was quite likely one in a long line of incidents where she had to take damage because of her brother and it was just the last straw.\n\nUs readers have no way of knowing how bad things are. But the parents are neglecting one child because of the other. If the son is that bad, he needs to be going to weekly therapy, and the parents should have access to some hours of care for him. He should have a support person at school. There's also the chance that his parents are simply opting not to discipline him (i.e. \"he can't help it, he's ND\"), which would not be doing him any favours. At age 8, even as a ND kid, it's possible he could manage himself somewhat better than he seems to be (e.g. he may not need a parent up with him every time he's awake at night - perhaps he could be taught to lie in bed with a small nightlight on, listening to music or an audiobook with headphones).\n\nIt's easy for you to tell your niece to have compassion for her parents. You're not suffering on a daily basis the way she is. So try to have some compassion for her. Make time to spend with her, make her feel special and important to you. Give her a safe space where she's not required to forfeit to her brother, and where the plans made for her don't fall through because of him.

I know that probably wasn't your intention, and maybe it is a stretch, but I dunno.\n\nI think there was a way you could have explained her parents' perspective while also validating that it is okay for her to feel frustrated. I think it would have done more for her to help process that frustration. Genuine mistakes do happen! I have sympathy for her parents. And it is also possible to acknowledge that, even if unintentional, the impact of those mistakes can be really hurtful, and it's okay to be upset. Minimizing those feelings will not help her feel more empathetic towards her parents - allowing vulnerability and care for those difficult feelings will. In fact, modeling empathy towards her will be more helpful, as you are the grown-up in the situation, too. She is allowed to have her feelings, especially at 12, which is already a time of great change in life and can be really tricky. Like others have said, often older sisters are asked to be the bigger person without regard to their own needs, especially in circumstances like these. I always hated that growing up. It is not fair to her. She must feel tired and angry too, and those feelings must be building up over years and years! There is only so much a kid can take. She needs to be able to express them and feel heard and loved. Add to that this specific situation of this stressor on her birthday, which would understandably be upsetting even without the surrounding context.\n\nI definitely feel for you that this seems like a difficult situation/circumstance, and I can see that you had good intentions.

And apologizing is a first step.\n\nEveryone has needs in this situation, that must be met, I just don't think it's fair to ask a kid to prioritize a grown-up's needs over their own - especially a grown-up who is responsible for caring for that child. It reminds me of many times growing up when I had to be more emotionally mature than my father, and the toll that takes (and how it enables bad behavior from parents!). It hurts to be told you are making life hard for your parents and that you need to minimize yourself. It makes you feel like a burden and that you can't ask to be cared for yourself - or that you need to be the caretaker in the situation. It is very unhealthy to make children provide the emotional support to parents in that manner, when they need to be receiving it from a caregiver.
