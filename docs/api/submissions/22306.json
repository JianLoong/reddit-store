There are a host of reasons why you should always keep your dog on leash while hiking and why it\u2019s the law in many places:\n\n1. It keeps your dog safe. Many animals including wildlife are out there. An encounter with a raccoon or a fox would mean a mandatory quarantine for your dog because of the threat of rabies. No dog is 100% reliable when encountering a squirrel or other wildlife - no matter how well behaved the dog is.\n2. It keeps other dogs safe. Not all dogs are well-behaved and friendly even if yours is.  A leashed dog may react aggressively if your unleashed dog approaches them. If there\u2018s an incident of attack or injuries, you will be legally responsible for not leashing your dog.\n3. It keeps other people safe. Bikers or hikers could get injured from tripping or falling while trying to avoid your dog.\n4. Not everyone is a dog lover or feels comfortable passing by an unleashed dog. Many people want to enjoy walks without your dog frightening them. Many children are frightened of dogs, even friendly ones.\n5. It protects the environment and human health. If your dog is running off-leash, defecates, and you don\u2019t see it to pick it up, then it is left for people and other dogs to step in and it eventually runs off into the streams.", "I am not sure.  The fact you are asking AITA shows there is hope for you, but having large dogs off leash is a recipe for disaster in most places.\nI have lost count of the maulings and bites and annoying encounters resulting from off leash dogs.  And virtually every time the dog owner says \" oh he's usually so friendly.\"  \nIt's not the world's responsibility to adapt to your dog.  Ever.", "YTA, dogs belong on leashes and this is your version of the story, according to the biker's perspective he may have swerved in order to avoid hitting your loose dog, you don't know or might not be wholly honest about it if you did know.", "Info:  How can it be an off leash trail and a bike friendly trail?

People and especially children aren\u2019t always dog lovers and have genuine phobias of them that need to be respected. People also have allergies that are serious. Just because you happen to have the one dog in existence that isn\u2019t a menace to society that doesn\u2019t mean you get to decide the rules for its care in public.

Keeping it on a leash adds an extra layer of security for both you, your dog, other dogs, other people, nature, and wildlife. \n\nWhile it's great that you seem in control of your dog, not everyone is. It's impossible for passersby to know that you have complete control of the dog purely through voice commands, or that your dog is \"too old\" to run around. Not to mention the fact that no dog is 100% reliable when something unexpected happens.\n\nIt's also worth noting that although your dog is in control, off leash areas also allow less responsible and less in-control dog owners to do the same.

Off lead doesn't mean out of control - I spent a year long lining and working on recall to achieve that. The dog in this post was clearly off lead, but under control, it was recalled and was held for the cyclist to pass.\n\n2. Off lead doesn't mean out of sight and out of control - OP was clearly paying attention, saw the cyclists, and recalled the dog. The issue was the cyclist who had clearly failed to notice OP and the dog. The dog could equally have been a child running on the trail, leaving the cyclist hitting a child.\n\nOP never said their Off lead dog was running up to others, people, dogs, or children. Again, they recalled the dog and had it under control ( held by the collar). As a responsible dog owner, it's pretty normal to recall your dog and have it walk on the lead or at heel when passing others.\n\nDog could have been a toddler running on the path and called to the parents side with similar results for the cyclist. \n\n3. Off lead again doesn't mean you can't see the dog, clean up poop or notice wildlife, other people to prevent interaction.\n\n4. OP never said which country they were in, nor did they say they were in a nature reserve. Off lead is fairly normal on woodland footpaths and trails in the UK, and I imagine many other countries. As is recalling the dog when passing others unless you are rude. The cyclist was also a risk to wildlife if they were going at unreasonable speed.\n\n5. Dogs need off lead exercise, and they need a good supervising owner, which OP seems to have been.\n\n Trails and paths belong to no one, we all need to be considerate of each others needs to use the trails, this means controlling your dogs, children, yourself and your cycling speed to not impact others enjoyment. \n\nNTA", "To take an example, I live in a seaside town.

Plus a lot of dog owners here are terrible about picking up after their leashed pet, and they're even worse when the dog's off leash, since they often can't see where the dog pooped.", "North America has plenty of places where dogs can run around off leash. It's just not everywhere because we also need to consider other people and the impact that dogs can have sensitive wilderness habitats. Running around in the woods along a quiet trail is one thing. But if there are lots of dogs every day running around up a high alpine meadow, chasing after marmots, that is not great. That's why some trails are leash only or just no dogs allowed at all.", "Except that your off leash dog in the wild, ie on hiking trails in the woods, is harmful for the environment it is in. So no, leash your dog when you\u2019re told to. There\u2019s a reason.", "I didn't even vote, or say anything about my own reactions to dogs. I won't claim to be super fond of dogs I don't know, but I'm not phobic or anything, and certainly won't call anyone an AH to their face for following the rules regarding leashes. I will, however, maintain the right to think the rule should maybe be changed. Also, I have been jumped, scratched, and bitten by a variety of dogs, all of which were completely unprovoked, and could have been easily prevented by the owners; I think I'm allowed to have feelings on the matter.\n\n\"Offleash areas\" can be anywhere. As someone who doesn't own a dog, I don't know exactly what areas those are; I'm fairly certain it's allowed in all \"woodsy\" areas where I live, only limited by the time of year. In your opinion, should anyone who doesn't 100% agree with your view on dogs just... not hike, ever? That doesn't seem fair to me. I find that mindset to be insufferable.\n\nLook, I'm not saying dogs shouldn't have rights or anything. I'm just saying it's a bit more complex than a straight-up \"yes\" or \"no\" question. For me personally, my main issue is that a LOT of dog owners are not responsible dog owners, and don't have the degree of control necessary to keep their dogs off leash... but designating areas (or time periods!) as \"off leash\" means letting irresponsible dog owners keep their dogs off leash, as well. Seeing as it's not harmful for the dog to be kept on a leash, it seems like a fairly small sacrifice to make, if it means keeping all dogs, people, and wildlife both safer and more comfortable, even if it was only for the fact that it means irresponsible dog owners can't let their dogs run free.", "Not sure why you are getting downvoted. People need to start using their brain. Hmm I don\u2019t like dogs or I\u2019m afraid of dogs.. I\u2019ve got a great idea! I\u2019ll go to an offleash trail and freak the fuck out on people for having their dogs offleash. No joke I see this shit too often.", "Lmao", "Bikers are supposed to yield to pedestrians. He was supposed to either stop to let them pass, or dismount and walk past them. \n\nYour daughter and wife are allowed to take up space.", "Not in an off leash designated area", "[removed]", "Swans is just mad that there are places that are different than the place they live in. Yes nature is very normal, Swans is just being aggressive for no reason lol", "this is so dependent on your dogs breed and personality. if you have any kind of hunting/scenting dog they are really prone to following a scent or animal they get excited about while tuning out anything you say to them. mine is a herding mix so she\u2019s super clingy, she\u2019s too nervous to ever let me out of her sight when we\u2019re in the woods so i feel safe letting her off leash in places like what OP is describing. just like humans they have their natural strengths and weaknesses, that doesn\u2019t make you a bad dog owner! my dog has amazing recall but she has never fetched a single item in her life, they can\u2019t be good at everything \ud83d\ude02", "I can control my dog. Dunno what else to say. I\u2019ve trained them from the time we had them and they listen. I take them on hikes, camping, etc and follow the leash rules. But if no leash is allowed they\u2019re not on it, and I\u2019ve never had any incidents of them running off towards a person, squirrels, deer, or anything. They don\u2019t even get more than 10 feet away from me, and they\u2019re never ahead on the trail because that\u2019s a rule they follow. A dog just requires training and they\u2019ll behave. Most people don\u2019t train their dogs properly, even if they listen at home. I\u2019ll grant you that. \n\nThat said, and off leash park is an off leash park. If people don\u2019t want to encounter an off leash dog it\u2019s the wrong place to go.", "People think their dogs are special and different and perfectly behaved. I went on nature walk with my dog yesterday. Signs everywhere that said dogs must be on a leash. First dog we encountered was off-leash, owner had to release her toddler daughter\u2019s hand to grab the dog\u2019s collar before he could run to me and my dog.", "People are so ridiculous and entitled lmao. It\u2019s insane", "So YOU have problems following the signage?", "I don't know where you are, but that's not the case where I am. Hikers always yield for bikes. Always. It's far easier to step aside and then start walking again, than it is to pull aside and start biking again in the middle of a trail.\n\nDownhill riders also always yield to uphill riders. It's easier to start going down hill again than uphill.\n\nThis isn't a road, it's a forest trail. There are different rules. Nonetheless, NTA op. You stepped aside and they made themselves crash.", "Because in the U.S. (I'm assuming the O.P. is American but if not I'll speak of my experience and why we generally expect dogs to be leashed....) there are a lot of irresponsible dog owners. Unleashed uncontrolled dogs create opportunity for tragedies to happen. A dog may be well behaved 99% of the time but if it were to get spooked they could cause injury to someone. Not mention dogs are dogs not people. We like to think they have the same emotions and critical thinking that humans do.but they don't.  Even the best dogs can sometimes be agressive towards other dogs or people in unusal circumstances. My dogs are excellently behaved. They heel well, are recall trained and if I give the focus command they heel and look at my face instead of reacting to various distractions. Even so I leash them in public for their safety mostly and for the safety of others. I also have a pitbull so I am hyper vigilant. I find often people allow their small dogs to get away with horrendous behavior because they're little. But if a little dog were to pick a fight with my dog even if both were unleashed the balme would likely fall in my bigger dog. She would also probably cause more damage to a small dog unintentionally. But in OPs case in an off leash area I guess they were complying to the rules. It's my personal choice I wouldn't allow mine off leash in view of people and would e done exactly what OP did.", "This sounds like heaven, where are you?", "Comment stealing bot", "Seriously! I\u2019ve been pointing out that most trails in my country have a rule that bikers have to yield to pedestrians. I\u2019m getting downvoted! Why is it always the rules are for thee not for me?", "I wonder if they\u2019re thinking of in cities where bikers are not supposed to ride on pedestrian walkways. What you said has always been the rule I\u2019ve known for trail biking and hiking.", "And even when a dog is super well trained like yours and extremely well behaved, it's also such a caring thing to do, to leash your dog, because sometimes people are scared of dogs and it makes them feel so much safer to be in public. Years ago, I was walking my roommate's dog around our neighborhood, and he was being good so I decided to drop the leash for a few minutes. A lady walked by, and he got super happy and went to say hi. She screamed and froze, and I quickly grabbed the leash and hurried him away. I did tell her as we left that he was trying to say hi and that I'm so sorry we scared her. I learned my lesson and never again. So thank you for being such a responsible pet owner and for being so compassionate to your dogs, other dogs, and other people!", "Thanks for replying! Pitbulls are banned in my country under the dangerous dogs act so we don't have them for the last hmmm 30+ years, along with similar breeds.\n\nMost people will leash their dogs near roads here, if they're not its usually a working dog like a collie. But even the smallest of greenspaces you will find unleashed dogs. There's definitely a culture difference.", "Im in the UK, definitely a far cry from heaven! But there are lots of dogs haha. Having your dog on a leash is treated more of a common sense thing from my personal experience. Like you'd leash your dog if you were crossing farmland for example. But where I live in the Yorkshire Dales, there's lots of hiking and greeting dogs is just part of that.", "Because they\u2019re moronic hypocrites \ud83d\ude02 funny how far drivers have to yield for cyclists at all costs, yet cyclists have no problem whizzing right by pedestrians and bitching when we don\u2019t psychically know when to move out of the way", "I'm over here just imagining a little doggy Utopia."]}
