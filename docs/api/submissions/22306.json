There are a host of reasons why you should always keep your dog on leash while hiking and why it\u2019s the law in many places:\n\n1. It keeps your dog safe. Many animals including wildlife are out there. An encounter with a raccoon or a fox would mean a mandatory quarantine for your dog because of the threat of rabies. No dog is 100% reliable when encountering a squirrel or other wildlife - no matter how well behaved the dog is.\n2. It keeps other dogs safe. Not all dogs are well-behaved and friendly even if yours is.  A leashed dog may react aggressively if your unleashed dog approaches them. If there\u2018s an incident of attack or injuries, you will be legally responsible for not leashing your dog.\n3. It keeps other people safe. Bikers or hikers could get injured from tripping or falling while trying to avoid your dog.\n4. Not everyone is a dog lover or feels comfortable passing by an unleashed dog. Many people want to enjoy walks without your dog frightening them. Many children are frightened of dogs, even friendly ones.\n5. It protects the environment and human health. If your dog is running off-leash, defecates, and you don\u2019t see it to pick it up, then it is left for people and other dogs to step in and it eventually runs off into the streams.", "I am not sure.  The fact you are asking AITA shows there is hope for you, but having large dogs off leash is a recipe for disaster in most places.\nI have lost count of the maulings and bites and annoying encounters resulting from off leash dogs.  And virtually every time the dog owner says \" oh he's usually so friendly.\"  \nIt's not the world's responsibility to adapt to your dog.  Ever.", "YTA, dogs belong on leashes and this is your version of the story, according to the biker's perspective he may have swerved in order to avoid hitting your loose dog, you don't know or might not be wholly honest about it if you did know.", "Info:  How can it be an off leash trail and a bike friendly trail?  Feels contradictory and unsafe.", "Soft YTA. Dog owners need to understand not everyone loves dogs\u2026if you\u2019re in an area where you know other people will be, then have your dog on a leash. It really isnt that hard and it\u2019s a little selfish. People get freaked out or have been attacked by dogs in the past or people, like this guy, could be biking and could get startled by the unleashed dog, not everyone sees a dog as a cuddly harmless \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d.\n\nEdit: for all you smartasses downvoting me, OP didn\u2019t originally specify it was a off-leash area, so my new answer is NTA then.", "Dogs should only be off leash in off leash areas.\n\nY-T-A.\n\nEdit: NTA, but for future reference, the off leash info should have been included from the start, it\u2019s kind of a major piece of info.", "Are there any signs that state this is a dog route?", "YTA.

People and especially children aren\u2019t always dog lovers and have genuine phobias of them that need to be respected. People also have allergies that are serious. Just because you happen to have the one dog in existence that isn\u2019t a menace to society that doesn\u2019t mean you get to decide the rules for its care in public.

Keeping it on a leash adds an extra layer of security for both you, your dog, other dogs, other people, nature, and wildlife. \n\nWhile it's great that you seem in control of your dog, not everyone is. It's impossible for passersby to know that you have complete control of the dog purely through voice commands, or that your dog is \"too old\" to run around. Not to mention the fact that no dog is 100% reliable when something unexpected happens.\n\nIt's also worth noting that although your dog is in control, off leash areas also allow less responsible and less in-control dog owners to do the same.

Off lead doesn't mean out of control - I spent a year long lining and working on recall to achieve that.

Off lead doesn't mean out of sight and out of control - OP was clearly paying attention, saw the cyclists, and recalled the dog. The issue was the cyclist who had clearly failed to notice OP and the dog. The dog could equally have been a child running on the trail, leaving the cyclist hitting a child.\n\nOP never said their Off lead dog was running up to others, people, dogs, or children. Again, they recalled the dog and had it under control ( held by the collar). As a responsible dog owner, it's pretty normal to recall your dog and have it walk on the lead or at heel when passing others.\n\nDog could have been a toddler running on the path and called to the parents side with similar results for the cyclist. \n\n3. Off lead again doesn't mean you can't see the dog, clean up poop or notice wildlife, other people to prevent interaction.\n\n4. OP never said which country they were in, nor did they say they were in a nature reserve. Off lead is fairly normal on woodland footpaths and trails in the UK, and I imagine many other countries. As is recalling the dog when passing others unless you are rude. The cyclist was also a risk to wildlife if they were going at unreasonable speed.\n\n5. Dogs need off lead exercise, and they need a good supervising owner, which OP seems to have been.\n\n Trails and paths belong to no one, we all need to be considerate of each others needs to use the trails, this means controlling your dogs, children, yourself and your cycling speed to not impact others enjoyment. \n\nNTA", "To take an example, I live in a seaside town.

As someone who doesn't own a dog, I don't know exactly what areas those are; I'm fairly certain it's allowed in all \"woodsy\" areas where I live, only limited by the time of year. In your opinion, should anyone who doesn't 100% agree with your view on dogs just... not hike, ever? That doesn't seem fair to me. I find that mindset to be insufferable.\n\nLook, I'm not saying dogs shouldn't have rights or anything. I'm just saying it's a bit more complex than a straight-up \"yes\" or \"no\" question. For me personally, my main issue is that a LOT of dog owners are not responsible dog owners, and don't have the degree of control necessary to keep their dogs off leash... but designating areas (or time periods!) as \"off leash\" means letting irresponsible dog owners keep their dogs off leash, as well. Seeing as it's not harmful for the dog to be kept on a leash, it seems like a fairly small sacrifice to make, if it means keeping all dogs, people, and wildlife both safer and more comfortable, even if it was only for the fact that it means irresponsible dog owners can't let their dogs run free.", "Not sure why you are getting downvoted.

Not mention dogs are dogs not people. We like to think they have the same emotions and critical thinking that humans do.but they don't.  Even the best dogs can sometimes be agressive towards other dogs or people in unusal circumstances. My dogs are excellently behaved. They heel well, are recall trained and if I give the focus command they heel and look at my face instead of reacting to various distractions. Even so I leash them in public for their safety mostly and for the safety of others. I also have a pitbull so I am hyper vigilant. I find often people allow their small dogs to get away with horrendous behavior because they're little. But if a little dog were to pick a fight with my dog even if both were unleashed the balme would likely fall in my bigger dog.

It makes me nervous having dogs unleashed around dogs they aren't familiar with (like I  a park or something as I understand is the \"norm\" for you) just because you never know when a dog is going to act like a dog. I had a pitbull that was viscously attacked by a dachshund. My neighbor and I both were diligent when it came to keahsign our dogs in our yards. But one day the stars all aligned and both dogs slipped their leashes and met in the street. Their little guy growled. My bully growled back. Their little guy jumped up and bit my dog in the face repeatedly and my bully bit him once. Being so much bigger however he caused horrific damage. Luckily little Clyde ended up surviving after receiving emergency veterinary care. I was traumatized so I can't imagine how awful it was for his owners.  Thankfully they were completely rational. They had witnessed the whole showdown. They admitted their dog had \"started it\" and said my dog just \"went dog\". They ahd loved across the road from us for years and knew Porkchop was never a problem. They didn't blame us. A lot of people would've screamed for him to be euthanized due to his breed.

Several of the maintenance men that worked on the property where we all rented from vouched to the police saying they've never known him to be off the leash. They came and went freely into my yard without ever feeling unsafe. I was worried that I'd have to give my dog up to be put down. I was heartbroken for the neighbors. I ended up splitting their vet bill with them and Clyde went on to make a full recovery. He had a severed liver, collapsed lungs, internal bleeding, but they saved him. Thank God.
