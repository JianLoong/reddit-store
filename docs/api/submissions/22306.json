There are a host of reasons why you should always keep your dog on leash while hiking and why it\u2019s the law in many places:\n\n1. It keeps your dog safe. Many animals including wildlife are out there. An encounter with a raccoon or a fox would mean a mandatory quarantine for your dog because of the threat of rabies. No dog is 100% reliable when encountering a squirrel or other wildlife - no matter how well behaved the dog is.\n2. It keeps other dogs safe. Not all dogs are well-behaved and friendly even if yours is.  A leashed dog may react aggressively if your unleashed dog approaches them. If there\u2018s an incident of attack or injuries, you will be legally responsible for not leashing your dog.\n3. It keeps other people safe. Bikers or hikers could get injured from tripping or falling while trying to avoid your dog.\n4. Not everyone is a dog lover or feels comfortable passing by an unleashed dog. Many people want to enjoy walks without your dog frightening them. Many children are frightened of dogs, even friendly ones.\n5. It protects the environment and human health. If your dog is running off-leash, defecates, and you don\u2019t see it to pick it up, then it is left for people and other dogs to step in and it eventually runs off into the streams.", "I am not sure.  The fact you are asking AITA shows there is hope for you, but having large dogs off leash is a recipe for disaster in most places.\nI have lost count of the maulings and bites and annoying encounters resulting from off leash dogs.  And virtually every time the dog owner says \" oh he's usually so friendly.\"  \nIt's not the world's responsibility to adapt to your dog.  Ever.", "YTA, dogs belong on leashes and this is your version of the story, according to the biker's perspective he may have swerved in order to avoid hitting your loose dog, you don't know or might not be wholly honest about it if you did know.", "Info:  How can it be an off leash trail and a bike friendly trail?  Feels contradictory and unsafe.", "Soft YTA. Dog owners need to understand not everyone loves dogs\u2026if you\u2019re in an area where you know other people will be, then have your dog on a leash. It really isnt that hard and it\u2019s a little selfish. People get freaked out or have been attacked by dogs in the past or people, like this guy, could be biking and could get startled by the unleashed dog, not everyone sees a dog as a cuddly harmless \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d.", "Dogs should only be off leash in off leash areas.\n\nY-T-A.\n\nEdit: NTA, but for future reference, the off leash info should have been included from the start, it\u2019s kind of a major piece of info.", "Are there any signs that state this is a dog route?", "YTA. Post this over on r/hiking and see what they say. Keep the dog on a leash for many reasons.", "Edit: NTA.", "YTA \n\nAs a dog owner myself I still vehemently believe dogs should ALWAYS be on the leash. There is not a single dog in existence that is perfect. None. I have a Pomeranian where the worst he could do is like nibble you and I still keep him on a leash, because you never know. \n\nThe bigger the dog the more important this becomes. I\u2019ve had so many people in off leash areas just let their dogs trample all over mine because \u201che\u2019s not doing anything.\u201d So many dogs with piss poor recall, so many dogs that still snapped at other dogs etc. \n\nAnd even if; by some miracle, your dog is the best behaved dog in the world. The others aren\u2019t. If it\u2019s on a leash you can still tug him back. I saved my little poms life multiple times because I\u2019m much more aware of other dogs body language than he is. \n\nOther than dogs it\u2019s also disrespectful to other humans. Not everyone likes dogs. Not everyone wants them roaming free. Some people are extremely scared and other can\u2019t be touched by them for religious reasons. A dog doesn\u2019t understand that but you as their owner should.", "ESH\n\nBiker was not in control of himself and vehicle.

You are putting your dog at risk if your letting him roam free where there are out of control bicyclists.", "YTA and I don\u2019t believe your edit of it being an off leash area.", "YTA.

You have no right to put others at risk.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s okay I\u2019m designated off leash places.\n\nLeashes are there to protect your dog and others!

It could be the cutest fluffiest ball of love possible but it still needs to be on a leash. Other dogs don\u2019t cope well knowing your dog is free to roam. People and especially children aren\u2019t always dog lovers and have genuine phobias of them that need to be respected. People also have allergies that are serious. Just because you happen to have the one dog in existence that isn\u2019t a menace to society that doesn\u2019t mean you get to decide the rules for its care in public.

And in my opinion, the answer is that no, you shouldn't. Keeping it on a leash adds an extra layer of security for both you, your dog, other dogs, other people, nature, and wildlife. \n\nWhile it's great that you seem in control of your dog, not everyone is. It's impossible for passersby to know that you have complete control of the dog purely through voice commands, or that your dog is \"too old\" to run around. Not to mention the fact that no dog is 100% reliable when something unexpected happens.\n\nIt's also worth noting that although your dog is in control, off leash areas also allow less responsible and less in-control dog owners to do the same.

We know where the sheep and farm animals are and can swiftly swap to on lead for those areas. \nVehicles aren't allowed on the footpaths, no wolves.

Off lead doesn't mean out of control - I spent a year long lining and working on recall to achieve that. The dog in this post was clearly off lead, but under control, it was recalled and was held for the cyclist to pass.\n\n2. Off lead doesn't mean out of sight and out of control - OP was clearly paying attention, saw the cyclists, and recalled the dog. The issue was the cyclist who had clearly failed to notice OP and the dog. The dog could equally have been a child running on the trail, leaving the cyclist hitting a child.\n\nOP never said their Off lead dog was running up to others, people, dogs, or children. Again, they recalled the dog and had it under control ( held by the collar). As a responsible dog owner, it's pretty normal to recall your dog and have it walk on the lead or at heel when passing others.\n\nDog could have been a toddler running on the path and called to the parents side with similar results for the cyclist. \n\n3. Off lead again doesn't mean you can't see the dog, clean up poop or notice wildlife, other people to prevent interaction.\n\n4. OP never said which country they were in, nor did they say they were in a nature reserve. Off lead is fairly normal on woodland footpaths and trails in the UK, and I imagine many other countries. As is recalling the dog when passing others unless you are rude. The cyclist was also a risk to wildlife if they were going at unreasonable speed.\n\n5. Dogs need off lead exercise, and they need a good supervising owner, which OP seems to have been.\n\n Trails and paths belong to no one, we all need to be considerate of each others needs to use the trails, this means controlling your dogs, children, yourself and your cycling speed to not impact others enjoyment. \n\nNTA", "To take an example, I live in a seaside town.
