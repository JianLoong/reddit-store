After the pool installation, I had my old fence removed and installed new fences that met with the city code for a residential pool. My new fence is higher than my old one and the gates have approved locks. \n\nAbout a month ago I had to travel for work and was gone for about 2 weeks. I came back to find my backyard trashed and it seems someone had a pool party while I was gone. The locks on my gates were broken but luckily no one broke into my house. I checked my security cameras and saw at least 20 teens having an all day party that lasted late into the night. I did not give permission for anyone to be at my house so I was mad. My cameras are HD so their faces were clearly visible and i recognized some from the neighborhood. I went to the police and submitted a copy of the recordings and tried to file a report. The cops did their best to try to talk my out of it but I pressed them on it until they relented and took a report. Weeks passed by and I heard nothing so I called them to find out nothing has been done. I got angry and threaten to sue unless they got off their behinds and enforce the laws. \n\nI should point out I live in a town of about 2000 people and nothing ever happens here. The cops are not understaffed or too busy on other cases. I also know I probably can\u2019t sue the cops into doing their jobs but I loose nothing by threatening a lawsuit and I was mad at the time.\n\nFinally they got some of the teens seen on my security video but again they tried to talk me out of pressing charges. I was adamant and insist they file charges. \n\nWhen my girlfriend found out about the situation, she said I should have let it go and we got into an argument about it. My own mother thinks I\u2019m being a bully by forcing the cops to file charges against some teens who just wanted to throw a party. Virtually everyone I know is making me out to be some grumpy guy with a score to settle and I kid you not, everyone in my life is trying to talk me out of it. They\u2019re worried about me destroying these teens\u2019 future over a pool party.\n\nI don\u2019t know when it became okay to break into someone\u2019s property.

Those entitled little shits thought they'd help themselves to it since you weren't around and trashed **your** property after *breaking into your back yard*. \n\nI'm not saying these kids need jail time, but they need to learn that actions have consequences. A fine or community service is a good way to make sure they understand it's not okay to help themselves to other's property just because they want it. \n\nI'd ABSOLUTELY do the same thing, and I'm not even a grumpy old man.", "NTA. May I suggest you leapfrog over the cops and start angrily bitching to the DA's office? After all, they are the ones that choose whether or not to prosecute. Of course, don't forget the civil lawsuit you have in your back pocket. You may want to consult an attorney for that. In fact, an attorney  complaining on your behalf to the DA might get more traction re: criminal charges.", "NTA! If one of them would have died then what? That\u2019s the whole purpose of the taller fences to keep people out.", "NTA.  Ridiculous that they want to rug sweep this.  Keep pushing.", "NTA. I don't know about you but growing up, I was told that actions had consequences.", "Kinda, but not really in the strictest sense.\n\nI try to remember back the stupid shit I did when I was a kid and didn't get caught bc of no security cams.\n\nIf it was me, I would ask the police to talk to parents and get the kids to mow your grass or even clean your pool for the summer.\n\nAt the end of the summer invite parents over for a party.  Who knows, might make a few friends and teach a few kids a lesson.\n\nJust my 2 cents.", "NTA, you are not destroying their future, you are holding them accountable for their actions. You should ask the people who are telling you to drop it if they would do the same if these teens broke into their house to have a party. They illegally trespassed on your property", "NTA if the police aren\u2019t prepared to do their jobs then what is their purpose? Why are they here? Why are they being paid?", "NTA but maybe there is room for compromise between pressing charges and ignoring the clear break-in and destruction of your property (locks and whatever).  Those teens owe you whatever it cost you to repair/clean up after them and a bit more.  The bit more could be yard work, window washing, whatever you can work out with their parents.  What they did was not okay and should not be treated that way by anyone.  I do agree they deserve a chance to sort of right their wrong though in a way that makes you whole and does not damage their futures.", "NTA. They damaged your property, they should face consequences. And it's disgusting that the POLICE tried to talk you out of filing charges. Or even filing the complaint in the first place! That's literally their job. \n\nMakes me wonder if these cops also harass minorities to meet their arrest quotas.", "ESH. It could have been handled better by all involved. Kids were just being kids. I get you being pissed, they trespassed and trashed your shit.", "NTA\n\nThey broke and entered and damaged things. If someone had gotten hurt or killed, I'm sure one of the parents would try to pin it on you.", "NTA. The teens didn't have your permission to be there, so they were trespassing. They also damaged your property, which cost you money. Even if they don't get charged, they should--at a bare minimum--be compensating you for cleanup and new locks.", "NTA\n\nWhat if one of those teens was SA or died on YOUR property? They BROKE your locks, INVADED your property and did NOT ask for your permission first. 100% you're NTA\n\nETA - Curious to know the eventual outcome", "NTA. Pools are a huge liability issue. You could have ended up getting sued if someone got hurt. And they trashed your property. There should be consequences", "NTA. Some of those kids are probably related to the cops who don't want you to press charges.", "NTA, all is fun and games until one drowns in your pool.  Get a pool alarm that will go off when one jumps in.", "NTA - I mean, you are a grumpy old guy, but that doesn't make you ta", "NTA", "NTA. Kids especially teens need to get put in their place. Also fuck these cops for doing anything other than their civil duty. If a citizen has a complaint and wants to press charges who gives a fuck how the cop feels.", "NTA, these teens ruined their own future by breaking the law. I missed the part where their future was your problem as well. People like that don't sound like the type who'll invent a cure for cancer.

From my POV, I\u2019d rather let this one slide and avoid decades of glares when you\u2019re about town", "The OP should expect some future vandalism of his house or property, and that when checked the footage will only show the perpetrators as shadowy figures in a hoodie, but which will clearly be retaliation for pressing charges.", "NTA I knew people who owned a pool and some kids broke in one night while they were gone. One of them drowned", "NTA - ask the cop for his home address because they want to throw a back to school party.", "INFO\n\nI thought it was up to the district attorney to press charges, not the police?", "NTA - unfortunately if one of those teens drown you'd be liable. Maybe it'll teach them not to use things that aren't theirs. If they had left it not broken or trashed you may have been able to just have a conversation with them. What if it had been inside your home? They need to learn that's not ok.", "If you don\u2019t take a hardline now, who knows what condition your property might be in next time you go away.  and what if one of them get hurt.

The list of crimes that seems to have been committed here ranges from the minor to some honestly pretty serious charges. What would have happened had one of them been injured, or drowned while inebriated? The planning behind this as well is rather worrying as well.", "Dude NTA but I be careful about retaliation a friend's uncle lives in Alabama and something similar happened and after he forced the cops to do their jobs. He started getting pulled over all the time and had his vehicle searched multiple times he also started getting citations and fines for dumb shit like garbage can being to close to the road or his license plate cover being to big even though the tags were perfectly readable or taillights being too dirty", "NTA\n\nThey broke in and caused property damage. Hopefully, having consequences teaches them not to do it again.", "NTA. \n\nBecause you know what, had one of those kids drowned you 100% would have had some kind of legal shit coming your way.  \n\nThe people in your life saying you shouldn't have are WAY out of line here.", "NTA, They not only trespassed, but they caused significant damage too. If they do it again and they get hurt, their parents can sue. Formally making a police report makes it clear that they were not allowed and were told to stay away, which may help you legally. Letting it slide will almost certainly bite you in the ass.", "Nta \n\nHow do they learn proper civic behavior unless it is enforced?\n\nThe judge had a lot of discretion to give them a warning and let them go - that\u2019s not for you to do.", "NTA \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomeone should be held accountable", "NTA\n\nI hate that \"kids\" nowadays are somehow not at fault because they're \"kids\". Teenagers know right from wrong. They know what they did was wrong and there are consequences. Period.", "NTA. If one of them drowned in your pool you know their parents would try to sue your ass off.", "Community service for each of them in order to drop charges. Pick up trash at a school or park.", "NTA. I was waiting for a detail or some kind of twist that would make this ambiguous but there wasn't one.\n\n>I came back to find my backyard trashed and it seems someone had a pool party while I was gone. The locks on my gates were broken\n\nI don't understand how this can be open to interpretation.", "NTA, and not only because of the damage to your property, what would have happened if someone had been injured or worse?", "NTA. They decided to destroy their future for a pool party", "NTA. If anybody these hooligans had been injured, or heaven forfend, drowned on your property, the parents would have had lawyers lining up at your door. \n\nTeens \"who want to throw a party\" should find a venue that doesn't involve committing felonies. The fact that they BROKE YOUR LOCKS shows an entitlement that is stunning.\n\nI am aghast that anyone is defending these felonious kids and their designer helicopter parents.", "NTA.  If you do not do this, it will happen again and eventually someone will get hurt", "INFO:  Why are they worried about \"destroying the teen's futures\"?   I mean, what charges would be filed -- are we talking about felonies?", "NTA Continue to press charges. This behaviour if excused likely will continue, and worse things than trashing  could have happened, like a drowning.", "NTA but how about you get a Loop Lock Pool Safety Cover? It's pricey but it looks like it'll be worth it. Never had one myself but I wanted to look up pool safety locks.", "It's your stuff.  A bunch of people (teenagers are people) came in and busted up your property.  To hell with them.", "NTA\n\nWe expect property owners to enforce their property rights. If they don\u2019t, those rights can magically get transferred away. Also, if you\u2019re seen to be turning a blind eye to this sort of thing, it can set you up to be liable if anything bad happens to them.\n\nIt sounds to me like the cops just don\u2019t feel like doing their jobs, or are friends with some of the teens\u2019 families. If the kids don\u2019t want to deal with the consequences of trespassing, they shouldn\u2019t trespass. If they are minors (without other bad behavior on their records), they will most likely get some community service, have to pay you some restitution, and that\u2019ll be the end of it.", "NTA. If there's no consequences, they'll think it's ok and will just keep doing it when you're out of town.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand how anyone can think you are? Someone broke into your property and vandalised it. You literally did the polices job by gathering evidence, and they can\u2019t even be bothered to arrest? What is this, dukes of hazard?
