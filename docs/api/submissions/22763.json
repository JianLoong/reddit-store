After the pool installation, I had my old fence removed and installed new fences that met with the city code for a residential pool. My new fence is higher than my old one and the gates have approved locks. \n\nAbout a month ago I had to travel for work and was gone for about 2 weeks. I came back to find my backyard trashed and it seems someone had a pool party while I was gone. The locks on my gates were broken but luckily no one broke into my house. I checked my security cameras and saw at least 20 teens having an all day party that lasted late into the night. I did not give permission for anyone to be at my house so I was mad. My cameras are HD so their faces were clearly visible and i recognized some from the neighborhood. I went to the police and submitted a copy of the recordings and tried to file a report. The cops did their best to try to talk my out of it but I pressed them on it until they relented and took a report. Weeks passed by and I heard nothing so I called them to find out nothing has been done. I got angry and threaten to sue unless they got off their behinds and enforce the laws. \n\nI should point out I live in a town of about 2000 people and nothing ever happens here. The cops are not understaffed or too busy on other cases. I also know I probably can\u2019t sue the cops into doing their jobs but I loose nothing by threatening a lawsuit and I was mad at the time.\n\nFinally they got some of the teens seen on my security video but again they tried to talk me out of pressing charges. I was adamant and insist they file charges. \n\nWhen my girlfriend found out about the situation, she said I should have let it go and we got into an argument about it. My own mother thinks I\u2019m being a bully by forcing the cops to file charges against some teens who just wanted to throw a party. Virtually everyone I know is making me out to be some grumpy guy with a score to settle and I kid you not, everyone in my life is trying to talk me out of it. They\u2019re worried about me destroying these teens\u2019 future over a pool party.\n\nI don\u2019t know when it became okay to break into someone\u2019s property. Right now it feels like it\u2019s me against the entire world.\n\nUpdate\n\nI\u2019m so glad I posted my situation here. Many of you pointed out that the cops might know the kids so that\u2019s why they\u2019re dragging the case. I never thought of that because I\u2019ve only lived here for 2 years. You all opened my eyes!\n\nI called my buddy who grew up and still live here so I invited him to dinner tonight. I asked him about my situation and showed him my security vid. He immediately said about half of the HS senior class was in the vid (his kids are in the same HS) and he recognized the daughter and niece of the mayor. He also told me he thinks a couple of the kids belong to the local prominent families one of which own one of the local grocery stores. \n\nWe talked about it and I decided to take your advice and drop the case in exchange for the parents paying the damages. I\u2019ll call the cops tomorrow about it. \n\nThere is a post below about someone\u2019s uncle living in Oklahoma who made a complaint and subsequently got pulled over repeatedly for phantom traffic violations. That really opened my eyes and I definitely do not want that to happen to me.", "created_utc": 1689891228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155517s/aita_for_bullying_the_police_into_pressing/", "score": 2051, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just hope that you have thought about the bigger picture in this situation. And I say that as someone who was in a very similar situation decades ago, but on the teenager side. In my story, I was in a group of 15-20 people that vandalized the home of a classmate. The idea was initiated by 1-3 people in the group, and through peer pressure/groupthink we all ended up joining in. No one who was asked to join in declined (wanting to fit in/be accepted as a teen is a very powerful force). Additionally, this group was quite varied in their school standing/socioeconomics: A couple of shit stirrers, yes, but primarily a lot of normal students who got good grades and to my knowledge never really engaged in anything remotely destructive before or since then (I was sort of in between). In the end, we committed about $1,000 of damage, along with more minor cosmetic things like TP on trees, forks in the lawn, etc.\n\nThrough gossip, everyone involved in it got outed, and our local police officer made the rounds to all our houses. But instead of writing up citations or giving court summons or arresting us, the officer told us that we needed to go meet and talk to the house owners. And that's what we all did. I remember the parents being relatively calm and reasonable, and them accepting my sincere apology for the damage we caused. We agreed to all pay them for the materials and labor that it cost for a professional to come out and fix everything. It was a lesson learned for all of us to think better about the consequences of our actions, and looking back I have a lot of gratitude for the level headedness they provided in that situation.\n\nSo reading your story, I wonder how this would have went down if you were the person I had to deal with. Would I be staring down a criminal record? Would getting a criminal record have really been a valuable lesson for most of the people in my group, a vast majority of whom have since gone on to finish college (some graduate level) and have had decent careers and started families? I think a criminal record would have stopped some of us dead in our tracks. And since in your story this is also a group of 20 people, I'm questioning how many of them really went into this with bad intentions, and how many of them just fell victim to groupthink and the desire to fit in.\n\nSo, at least think about what you're hoping to achieve by continuing to pursue charges. You definitely can and should recoup the costs for all of the damage (and maybe more). And you certainly can teach them a valuable life lesson, while not going all the way down this path for all of these people. But just be aware that if you go all the way down, it's very likely that you will be overcorrecting for a couple of these people.", "Parents can step up and offer some $ to make the situation right.

It's your property, they trespassed, broke in, and damaged it, and there needs to be consequences. \n\nEveryone who is telling you to let it go would be singing a different tune if someone did it to their home, their pool, their car, or their property in general.", "NTA most likely what will happen is they\u2019ll be able to do community service and get it expunged from their records anyway, and this way their parents will know what happened and hopefully they learn their lesson.

They need to learn there are consequences to the their actions.", "NTA, it\u2019s your property and you\u2019re responsible. However I will say since it is a small town you could maybe go the route my hometown followed. We all know that most teenagers aren\u2019t firing on all cylinders yet. So the adults would give us some grace and would gather the culprits up and they all had to community service of sorts. We cleaned up fixed stuff. Whatever the todo list was until the owner found they were compensated enough. Good old sweat equity. Every couple years a group of kids would mess up get busted and work it off enough. We all behaved for a few years. \ud83d\ude02 stories from older siblings were enough for us to learn from!", "NTA - If one of the kid was hurt or died, 100% the parents would have sued you. Tell anyone giving you shit that if *they* want to risk their own finanical stability and legal records to let kids party on their property without supervision or permission they are free too. You however will not risk a lawsuit or legal issues because your neighbors are too lazy to parent. Now if they pull it again and someone hurt you have a solid irrefutable paper trail that they KNEW they weren't allowed there.\n\nProsecutor will plead it out and expunge it for some community service and the kids will learn an important lesson about trespassing and destroying property. You meanwhile will be inoculated from a lot of future liability should they try to repeat said adventure and have one of them die or be injured through stupid behavior. \n\nYour GF and mom need a reality check about how much the kids choices could fuck up YOUR life if you DIDN'T take a hard line against their behavior.", "You should sue all their parents for damages.

Is fucking with the TEENAGERS who did you wrong worth a potential long term problem between you two? Is there any other repercussion you could work out with them outside of the formal law?

Teens don't plan on things like that happening but how many times have you heard about someone jumping in a pool and hitting their head and become paralyzed or drown because everyone is having a good time and didn't notice. This actually happened to my granddaughter's friend. He had permission and was at his friends house. They didn't notice until he had been in the water for awhile. It was said he was without air for like eight to 12 minutes. At first they told his family he was almost brain dead and to prepare. Then he rallied and came back but he had to go thru weeks and months of rehab. He got almost back to normal but not all the way.", "NTA.

If one of them got hurt you would be responsible for that.", "NTA what the heck is wrong with everyone? Actions have consequences.

Someone is liable for damages?

This is exactly what I wanted to say! Going straight to police and pressing charges without even talking to the parents of the kids you recognized feels like going nuclear to me. Laying charges should be the last option after other actions have failed. Start small, then escalate.", "I'll rephrase what you just said, as \"they had a pool party in your backyard when you were out of town for a couple a weeks\" is bullshit.

Teenagers or not, OP has full right to press charges and let the court decide what happens to those criminals-in-the-making.", "How would that work? Op didn't know any of the kids.", "Yeah I definitely think you should think about if the outcome and effect on your life in terms of friendships and relationships etc is worth pressing charges.

Cops would have been more than happy to arrest HIS ass for negligently leaving his pool unattended while a kid drowned!", "It'd also be a shame if the kids' party moved to the home and property of the ineffective cops!  I bet they wouldn't be so dismissive of it then.", "Yeah, actually having to face consequences for their actions might \"damage their future\".", "OP you are NTA and no you are not a bad guy here. You didn't bully the cops into pressing charges either. You are NTA for trying to protect your property too.

Little shits. NTA.", "Nope. There was a fence with code-compliant locks. Since OP followed all laws regarding fencing off their pool area, they wouldn't be liable.

At most they'll get community service and maybe curfews, and if they're minors the files get closed if they fulfill the sentence without further offending.
