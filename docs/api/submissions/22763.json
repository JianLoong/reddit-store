My new fence is higher than my old one and the gates have approved locks. \n\nAbout a month ago I had to travel for work and was gone for about 2 weeks. I came back to find my backyard trashed and it seems someone had a pool party while I was gone. The locks on my gates were broken but luckily no one broke into my house. I checked my security cameras and saw at least 20 teens having an all day party that lasted late into the night. I did not give permission for anyone to be at my house so I was mad. My cameras are HD so their faces were clearly visible and i recognized some from the neighborhood. I went to the police and submitted a copy of the recordings and tried to file a report. The cops did their best to try to talk my out of it but I pressed them on it until they relented and took a report. Weeks passed by and I heard nothing so I called them to find out nothing has been done. I got angry and threaten to sue unless they got off their behinds and enforce the laws. \n\nI should point out I live in a town of about 2000 people and nothing ever happens here. The cops are not understaffed or too busy on other cases. I also know I probably can\u2019t sue the cops into doing their jobs but I loose nothing by threatening a lawsuit and I was mad at the time.\n\nFinally they got some of the teens seen on my security video but again they tried to talk me out of pressing charges. I was adamant and insist they file charges. \n\nWhen my girlfriend found out about the situation, she said I should have let it go and we got into an argument about it.

They\u2019re worried about me destroying these teens\u2019 future over a pool party.\n\nI don\u2019t know when it became okay to break into someone\u2019s property.

If anybody these hooligans had been injured, or heaven forfend, drowned on your property, the parents would have had lawyers lining up at your door. \n\nTeens \"who want to throw a party\" should find a venue that doesn't involve committing felonies.

If you do not do this, it will happen again and eventually someone will get hurt", "INFO:  Why are they worried about \"destroying the teen's futures\"?   I mean, what charges would be filed -- are we talking about felonies?", "NTA Continue to press charges. This behaviour if excused likely will continue, and worse things than trashing  could have happened, like a drowning.", "NTA but how about you get a Loop Lock Pool Safety Cover? It's pricey but it looks like it'll be worth it. Never had one myself but I wanted to look up pool safety locks.", "It's your stuff.

If the kids don\u2019t want to deal with the consequences of trespassing, they shouldn\u2019t trespass.

CLEAN UP THE HOUSE!!!", "> OP would be in no way liable for ANYTHING that happened since these people were ILLEGALLY trespassing.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not necessarily true. \n\nIt\u2019s a safe bet that if one of the teenagers had drowned, their parents would have filed a lawsuit before OP could blink, calling the pool an attractive nuisance and insisting that their sweet, precious, lamented Bratleigh couldn\u2019t help putting themselves in danger.\n\nWould you want your financial future to depend on a jury not being swayed by parents wailing over their dead kid into blaming you for said dead kid\u2019s idiocy and criminal behavior?", "Even if the courts were to side with OP, dealing with a lawsuit is still a lot of time and money and stress and work.", "There have been cases of people breaking into houses, getting hurt, and then suing the home owner.  I'm sure in this world of mental gymnastics, a kid getting hurt on their property could result in a lawsuit against the property owner.", "Actually it's happened before. That story about a burgler who fell through a skylight and cut his leg and sued the family? He won. And he was never prosecuted for his crime. The world is becoming more entitled by the minute.", "Not true, anyone injured in his property can sue even if they were trespassing, depending on the location", "Pools count as attractive nuisances in many municipalities which boils down to OP being liable even if they were trespassing.", "Not where I live. Kids under 18 can\u2019t legally trespass so they are always treated like a guest would be. If the kids hurt themselves OP would be financially liable.", "What country do you live in? In most of the US, illegally trespassing isn't enough to win a suit if somebody gets hurt or drowns in your \"attractive nuisance\". If they say the locks were not locked or already broken, if the fence wasn't the proper height with proper distance between the slats, there were no \"no trespassing\" signs, no life jackets, they found alcohol unsecured on his porch and got drunk, leading to somebody tripping on a coping that presented a hazard... Would they win? Maybe, maybe not. But fighting it with a lawyer will be expensive and so will letting your homeowner's insurance handle it. Chances are very high that you'd get thrown in their risk pool and see your rates skyrocket.", "As someone who has dealt with weird behaviors from a cop before (and has regrets about how I failed to handle it), have your camera ready to go on your phone if you\u2019re pulled over and make sure the security cameras at your house are set to record all portions of your property.\n\nI\u2019m not saying there will be retaliation but be prepared for it.", "Say you won't press charges if the kids pay for damages and do yard work such as weeding and cutting the grass to  make up for the mess they made.  That should be a good compromise to where you aren't harrassed the teens get some type of punishment", "If you are worried about that. Say you will drop charges if they pay for the damages, do a significant amount of community service hours that they can't fudge the numbers on, and make a public apology.", "I would also be worried about retaliation from the teens and community. In a town that small, almost everyone had a relative at that party.\n\nYou might have just earned yourself a couple of years worth of annoying harassment by students that have nothing better to do than to mess with you.", "Saw you have a $800 damage. Why not settled by asking em to pay + community service? \n\n\nOr force em to sign a deal that if they ever trashed your place again, something bad will happen. So.. having a pepper trail or sumting.", "That was one of my first thoughts too. \u201cWhich of these teens are related to these cops?\u201d", "Ooooh, you\u2019re right! First officer who saw the video recognized the boss\u2019s kid!", "The last time someone stole the battery out of my car, 3rd time it happened, the cops wouldn't even come to take a report or dust for fingerprints or anything. Just straight up refused to do anything about it. I had to buy a cable lock to keep thieves from popping open my hood and stealing the battery.", "Gotta turn it into a race thing", "Town that size, probably all of them.", "Good point.", "Unfortunately it\u2019s not but I\u2019m happy that you\u2019ve never been affected by a situation like that! It happens every day and if these kids had been minorities the would have been in jail the same day and the cops would have nabbed them before OP finished hanging up the phone.", "Not necessarily. If actual crimes are not being prosecuted then the police might be targeting someone or something else.", "I understood what they meant, being a person who lives in a town of less than 2000 people.  They do not harass minorities but they do target the people who are struggling with paying their fines and of course repeat offenders. So they are easy targets. Yes that does happen.  Small town cops pretty much are lazy except maybe one. That is how it is here.", "Locked, tall fence and teenagers. Nah, no one is winning an attractive nuisance suit.", "NTA.  Ask the people giving you crap about it pay for the damages, see if they change their tune.  Why should you have to pay for others breaking the law and damaging your property?", "But you will make enemies and that may be worse.", "I know you are not here for legal advice but submit a claim with your homeowners insurance and file in small claims court against the little miscreants. \n\nAlso, bullying the police? That\u2019s so precious.\n\nNTA.", "C'est la vie.", "Because they are children. Children who don't get second, third, and forth chances turn into adults without opportunity most of the time. Guess what adults without opportunity do? (It's crime)", "I mean if it\u2019s that small of a town, easy to identify the kids/parents.  I think there\u2019s a step before pressing charges.", "Maybe some of the cops are the parents of these kids?", "I don't see how the possibility of injury is remotely relevant.", "Which is absolutely bullshit! Stupid fucking law! My grandmother was always worried some dumb kids would jump her fence & get hurt using her pool WITHOUT permission. I still don't understand that stupid shit.", "Wha...??! I could see it if you had some kind of electric cattle prod set up inside your door,  or roller skates on the stairs, but something that is *commonly* in that location? Would the burglar get to sue for the splinters acquired while breaking the door down too?", "Pools are usually considered an \u2018attractive nuisance\u2019 so if there is any fault or flaw in your set up to keep people out, it becomes \u2018your\u2019 fault if something happens to someone. Like if you have a good fence but a crappy lock on the gate the answer will be you should have had a better lock.", "That was my thought..at very least a relative", "Not poor, sweet, Bratleigh \ud83d\ude2d\n\nYou're 100000% right here! I immediately thought that's a lawsuit waiting to happen should something catastrophic occur. \n\nPlus if OP let it slide and there's no repercussions the likelihood is they'd do it again at the next available opportunity. \n\nIt's his property at the end of the day. They broke in, used, disprespected and trashed the place. There's got to be some form of punishment and I highly doubt the parents would do much even if he managed to track them down. It's just kids having a party after all \ud83d\ude44", "There's literally no chance of winning an attractive nuisance suit. Locked gate, teenagers, yea not happening.", "Was that story true or was it just in Liar, Liar?", ">Kids under 18 can\u2019t legally trespass\n\nSo can they just rob you too? Kids under 18 get tried as adults for lots of crimes many times in many jurisdictions.", "The parents should also be on the hook to fix the lock imo. Might want to also invest in No Trespassing signs as a deterrent.", "I would be very surprised if the police dont start harassing him by stopping him for no reason, following him, and since he has irrefutable proof,wouldnt surprise me if they plant drugs on him and tell him they will be willing to drop the charges in exchange of him dropping the issue of his home being trespassed and his pool being trashed.\n\nI say this because i inherited my dads house in a small town of about 5K people. My garage had been broken into & i could still smell cigarette smoke where someone had been smoking inside i even found cigarette  butts.  And the police officer told me he didnt smell anything and those butts couldve been there for years. Told me to forget about it.\n\nA week later a contractor who had been working on my house drove by and saw a guy on my front porch stooped down hiding by a large plant by the front door ( id been going in & out decorating for Christmas so he was hiding no doubt planning to push me into the house  when the door opened again).  The contractor drove thru my yard surprising the guy who jumped over the railing & the contractor tackled him in the front yard. I also had him on ring doorbell.\nHe asked the guy what he was doing and he said borrowing a phone from the guy inside.  The contractor said \"there is no guy inside\" and the guy broke away from him and ran away.   He called the police dpt and told them what he found and how he tackled the guy and they told him they could arrest him for assault.  They wouldnt even investigate because they said i didnt have up NO TRESPASSING signs and the guy was within his rights to be stooping down on my porch. That he didnt know he wasnt supposed to do that.\n\nI did my own investigation and found that the guy on my porch lived about 3 houses down from me and.it was his cousin that i spoke to on the phone \n\nAfter that random police cars would pull in my drive & back out when i opened my front door to go see what they wanted.  I sold the house shortly thereafter", "And because of.my experience with it being a neighbor a few houses down,  i can almost guarantee his neighborhood teenagers had prob been watching his house and knew when he left and that he packed for a trip and wouldnt be back.", "Or his own child", "I get the feeling some of the kids are related to the cops.\n\nNTA", "I mean, no one is saying to lock them up or send them to juvie.  but court mandated community service, etc isn't a bad thing.", "Other than the *murder, bribery, blackmail, bootlegging, gambling, and other mob stuff*, Al Capone didn't do anything really wrong.", "Because it wasn't your property that was broken into.\n\nIt wasn't your locks that were broken.\n\nIt wasn't your yard that got trashed. \n\nIt wasn't your pool pump that got broken. \n\nIt wasn't mine either, but as a responsible home owner I agree with OP. \n\nKids being kids isn't what they did. \n\nBeing in a small town doesn't excuse their actions.", "...and that's exactly what will happen if charges are pressed. OP doesn't press charges, nothing will happen because the parents probably have the same bullshit entitled attitude as you.", "What would a boot in the \u00e4ss be?", "Nah. If someone breaks into my property when they know I\u2019m not there and trashes and breaks shit, I\u2019m calling the cops. Especially at this point in time. I\u2019m not showing up to someone\u2019s house and accuse their kid of criminal acts, idk if I\u2019m gonna get shot or something.", "Very likely given their reaction.", " Bet you beans to biscuits that\u2019s the situation. Can\u2019t hide it under the rug because of the non-cop kids, it\u2019s all or nothing.", "That is so weird way of seeing the situation from legal perspective", "OP would have to hire an attorney regardless, wasting money and time. Nope, press charges.", "Also likely especially in a small town.", "It really wasn\u2019t that big a deal. You make it sound like they\u2019re career criminals instead of kids doing kid shit.", "You really sound reasonable now. I get it. You\u2019ll be that \u201cget off my lawn\u201d lady and wonder why your house gets egged every mischief night.", "I\u2019m well aware it wasn\u2019t my property. That doesn\u2019t make my opinion any less valid. It also doesn\u2019t make me interested in yours.", "I love how militant you folks get when someone disagrees with you. It\u2019s a small town, they could easily be made to do community service without having official charges filed. Your boy is in for a world of harassment if he keeps pushing.", "Community service.", "They cause 800 bucks worth of damage. Go headbutt a moose...", "But who would enforce it?"]}
