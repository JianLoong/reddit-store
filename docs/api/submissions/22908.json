Last night I was cooking pasta from scratch for supper, dished out and called the boys over to eat. One the kids just sat there sheepishly so I asked what was wrong and kid told me he was allergic to gluten. Was I told about this? No. So I rang up his mother and she apologised saying that she thought I knew because my ex knows about his allergies. She didn't tell me a thing. \n\nI'm going to be frank, I honestly didn't and don't have the fucks right now to be stressing over what food I can cook exclusively for this one boy. I know it's not his fault but he's high maintenance and I wasn't prepared for that. I told his mom that she had choice to make where she either orders him food to eat herself/sends money to order him food or he goes home. She said that was a weird request and she wasn't comfortable for with that so I told her it was best that he just goes home then. She asked if I could keep him for a few more hours because she was working but I didn't know what boy is going to eat meantime cause the boys were hungry. Kid can't even have a sandwich and it's not like I could make him a quick salad or toss him some chips while we're just digging into pasta right next to him. She agreed, we stalled supper and after 30 minutes she came to fetch him.\n\nI was on the call with my ex earlier today and told her about this and she was on my case about embarrassing us, the boy and being cheap/lazy so here I am.

In the meantime keep playing and we will figure this out.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s what you could\u2019ve done. Treat other children the way you\u2019d want YOUR child treated should he be in a situation alone without you. Yes the mother could\u2019ve told you. Yes it\u2019s a little bit harder to do but if your own child was in a position where he needed an adult\u2019s help let\u2019s hope they would show more compassion than you did in the moment. \n\nDefinitely YTA.", "YTA.

It would have been food, and he could have been full enough to power through the sleepover.\n\nYou didn't know beforehand, fine that's on the kid's parent. But you surely could have handled it better.", "YTA. You are telling me you don't have a single thing in your house without gluten? Sandwich innards without the bread, pasta sauce over rice or a microwaved potato? At 10, the kid would have been more than capable of helping find something he could eat (if he was serious enough to need a full GF kitchen or something, his mom would have packed him food). I appreciate that you don't have a lot of fucks to give right now, but if that is the case, you really shouldn't be hosting other people's kids anyway.", "It reminds me of the the time we were an youth group and it turned out one of the kids couldn't have the food. One mother promptly took her to a local McDonald's and bought her some food.\n\nObviously driving was out of the question, but my guy, he's a young kid who probably just got extremely embarrassed and shamed. As someone who has eating restrictions, I honestly bet it would've been better for him to sit and watch you guys eat while still hanging with his friends rather than having his mom come take him away from an event he was probably really looking forward to. \n\nI will try to be sympathetic and note that it was probably a stressful situation herding cats and this unexpected inconvenience threw you over the edge. I can see the stress of the situation. But...like take a few moments in the bathroom to collect yourself and then strategize with the mom about what can be done.\n\nPlease try to rectify this because that child is now going to walk on eggshells if he is ever at the house again. You made a mistake because of stress. It happens. Now rectify it.", "Do people honestly run their households so that there are no other options to choose from in these circumstances?

When she came to visit us a couple of years ago, although I had prepared for her by buying gluten free versions of some things, she also was able to eat things that did not contain gluten naturally. Because of course she was. \n\nAre you honestly saying that between your resources of the child, his mother, and fucking Google to advise you on gluten free things, that you couldn\u2019t take ten seconds to look in your fridge and cupboards and find something to knock together for a child in your care?

I feel awful for this poor child who has to deal with the burden of being excluded due to something he has no control over. And I hope he doesn't get an eating disorder over it.\n\nYou should have just ordered something for him and let the Mom know.  Then she could have quietly reimbursed you instead of you putting her on the spot and being aggressive about it. And if she didn't then chalk it up to you did something nice for a hungry boy.

A kitchen where you've been making homemade pasta would have wheat flour all over the place--tons of cross contamination. So she has some fault in all this.\n\nThat said, once you learned the boy had an allergy, you should have talked to mom to see if it was **possible** there was an easy way to solve this so he could stay. No one was asking you to whip up a batch of gluten free pasta on the fly. No one was asking you to order him gluten-free takeout on your own dime.

I agree the mom should have expressed beforehand, but nowadays I feel like it's common sense when having a gathering with several children to reach out and make sure there's no diet restrictions or allergies (mind you, I work with kids, so I could just be conditioned, but I mean, YOU'RE a parent). It seems like you penalized your son's friend just for his intolerance, even going so far as to paint it that you had \"no fucks\" to adhere to his sensitivity, when in all reality, if you have a decently stocked kitchen, it's not hard to find something that's not got gluten in it.", "YTA BIG TIME!", "YTA goddamn. I appreciate you've got other stresses evidently and there is clearly still some political stuff going on between you and your ex but also.

You both made oversights but this poor kid ended up not having dinner with everyone else and got left out of the sleepover because you didn't want to accommodate him, and it's not like a gluten intolerance is the most complex to work around in the grand scheme. I feel for you because clearly you were caught on the wrong foot and didn't know what to do with a kid with gluten intolerance when you'd just spent a lot of time making pasta from scratch so I can see why you were like \"Well what do I do now\" but this kid is going to remember this experience for a long time and it's always going to hurt that he missed out on a fun activity with all his friends because the adults around him dropped the ball. Like I fully appreciate the stress you're clearly feeling but you are the grown up and this is a kid who was temporarily in your care who had a lot less power in this situation than you. Just be mindful of that.", "YTA - what was this ? Your first time hosting a birthday party ? Dietary restrictions are extremely common and you should have asked all the parents of the kids coming just to be sure because life gets busy and sometimes people think you know like in this case where your ex forgot to inform you.  I find it Hard to believe you had nothing in your house to feed this kid. I\u2019m gluten free it\u2019s not that hard. I do not buy special food either. Meat , dairy , fruit , and veggies are all gluten free. Unless they are processed. Do you not keep real food in your home ?

To be completely fair, his mom should have paid you for any extra food you had to buy for him, but wow... Buying a kid a meal when they're staying over at your place is not really a huge ask. It does seem extremely cheap and picky of you to have not just doordashed him a gluten-free whatever from someplace. Maybe you could have quibbled about The 20 bucks with his mom later or something. Sending him home outright is embarrassing for everyone involved and extremely disruptive to his mom. To be clear though, in an absolutely fair world, sure, his mom should have paid for the food.

Last night I was cooking pasta from scratch for supper, dished out and called the boys over to eat. One the kids just sat there sheepishly so I asked what was wrong and kid told me he was allergic to gluten. Was I told about this? No. So I rang up his mother and she apologised saying that she thought I knew because my ex knows about his allergies. She didn't tell me a thing. \n\nI'm going to be frank, I honestly didn't and don't have the fucks right now to be stressing over what food I can cook exclusively for this one boy. I know it's not his fault but he's high maintenance and I wasn't prepared for that. I told his mom that she had choice to make where she either orders him food to eat herself/sends money to order him food or he goes home. She said that was a weird request and she wasn't comfortable for with that so I told her it was best that he just goes home then. She asked if I could keep him for a few more hours because she was working but I didn't know what boy is going to eat meantime cause the boys were hungry. Kid can't even have a sandwich and it's not like I could make him a quick salad or toss him some chips while we're just digging into pasta right next to him. She agreed, we stalled supper and after 30 minutes she came to fetch him.\n\nI was on the call with my ex earlier today and told her about this and she was on my case about embarrassing us, the boy and being cheap/lazy so here I am.

Also as the host she should have asked about food allergies.", "Hey now dad bods can be sexy af", "Tbh op is an ah but the child's mom is kind of an ah too. You say why couldn't op ask mom to bring food, well why couldn't the mom suggest and offer that herself?", "Mom made a mistake but even without pork, there are ways to feed a kid with issues with gluten.  Apparently the dad who watched all of these kids did not ask either.  When kids stay at my house, the first thing I ask - are there any medical issues I need to be aware of.  I don't just have kids stay over willy nilly and not ask questions and dietary needs are something one should ask.  There are a lot of peanut allergies and such.  Mom was about 25% at fault. Thus dad is still an ass and did not ask vital questions that any parent should ask when a child that is not their's stay over. That is babysitting 101.  Allergies, medical conditions and in case if emergency if I cannot get u who is next on the call list.", "Oatmeal is gluten free", "Oatmeal is gluten free, and you can google pretty much any major brand to see if people get reactions from cross contamination.", "You didn\u2019t have fruit or veggies ?  Seriously?", "You had no eggs?", "You were able to pick up the phone to call his mother which stands to reason you could have called and ordered him something.", "I agree that it could have been a bad idea and mom should have paid/brought food, but OP is YTA anyway, for his deplorable attitude. He wasn't asking for these things because he cared about the kid's health. He just couldn't be bothered to give two fucks.", "Lunch meat, condiments, maybe cheese and veggies. Roll and cut into pinwheels for finger foods.", "Charcuterie", "If OP has cold cuts, you take some meat, layer with cheese, and roll it up. You can slice them to make it fancy and call it a pinwheel.", "Mom can also be wrong, but that doesn\u2019t affect whether OP is the AH or not.", "you can be allergic to gluten but not have celiac (case in point, me who is allergic to gluten but has been tested negative for celiac)", "It's not the same thing, though. Gluten intolerance is a symptom of celiac, but not all gluten intolerants have celiac. Like I said in my comment, I work with kids, and I've dealt with both issues- two different ballgames.", "Celiac parents don't fuck around, they would have sent the kid with his own food packed in clean containers.", "And a good host asks just to be sure.", "When my daughter was 10, she had a friend with Type 1 diabetes who she invited to a slumber party. The mother never told me - my daughter did. I called the girl\u2019s mother to ask about food, and she told me her daughter knew what she could and could not eat and knew how to regulate her diet and carbs. It all worked out fine and the girl knew exactly how to handle the situation.", "Just to point out, OP did ask the mom to order takeout and the mom refused, asked for money to order takeout for the kid but the mom refused. OP didn\u2019t want to feed a child just a salad. So the kid had to go home", "Money? Not everyone can order Uber Eats Willy nilly.", "It's not my responsibility to know that, nor is it the hosts. Especially if he was unaware. How is anyone suppose to know the effects of a food allergy if they are unaware of it in the first place. Better safe then sorry.", "Give him some cheese n fruit etc", "There\u2019s diff levels of gluten allergy .. doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s deadly from cross contam", "From the pov of a 10 year old, a lot of things feel like a punishment. Doesn't make it one. How many kids blame themselves for their parents divorce?", "I drew the parallel between the two. If you chose to ignore that and my point then go off.", "Yeah, that\u2019s what makes OP TA in my book. Like dude, you had *nothing* in your home to feed that kid?\n\nNo tater tots or chicken nuggets? No rice and beans? No canned soups? No eggs? Potatoes?\n\nInstead, he singled out the kid with dietary restrictions as \u201cdifficult\u201d and made him go home early, not to mention making the mom leave work. What a shitty thing to do to a kid.", "Yea im replying to someone who said he should have gone to the store", "I don't know man. I just personally feel like it's worse to give the kid a half ass meal that isn't filling while we're just eating away and full. Sure the kid would've preferred that but that's because he's a kid and would probably sleep outside if we didn't have space inside just to be part of the sleepover. Doesn't make it right.\n\nHe still joined us for the activities (paintball, rides etc) he just went home again afterwards.", "I had specific budget for the weekend and couldn't go out of it.", "Dad was a complete jerk. But the subtext seems to be his problem with the kid's mom. She said she thought his ex told him about her kid's allergy. What kind of snide comment is that? Mom seems to be the one that is high maintenance. She doesn't seem too concerned about her son's health.\n\nOP just said screw this without any concern for the kid. You're right the kid got the worst of this.", "Heck yeah! I\u2019ve always loved them fluffy boyz and married one", "It can still trigger a percentage of people with celiacs disease.", "It can still trigger celiacs and people with avenin protein sensivity. Which is why until you know the specifics, googling is insufficient if someone has a allergy.\n\nIt's a small portion of celiacs, yes, but why take that risk?", "Yes I could've. That's why I asked her to do it or send money to refund that cost because I put aside a specific budget for the weekend for food and activities and couldn't go over it.", "But if the mom is also wrong the it's an ESH, not just YTA", "I'd still argue the greater responsibility falls on the person's who's child actually has an allergy.\n\nAllergies aren't really common where I'm from so maybe that's what's shaping my judgement here but you're royally irresponsible not informing someone about your kid's allergies. I still think he's an asshole for how he handled it but not asking who has allergies? Very simple oversight imo.", "Respectfully, that's not quite the same. Blood sugar doesn't spike just from exposure to a food, so the girl knowing what she could eat and couldn't would be fine. Celiac and gluten allergies can also be exposure based -- meaning that even if the boy didn't eat the gluten intentionally, he could still ingest it via cross contamination. All OP would have to do is use the same knife, fork, spoon, dish, unwashed counter, etc between food prep and then the kid is sick.", "My 13 nephew has a friend like this but my family makes sure to have low carb options for him.", "He can just ask the kid. It's not like it is esoteric knowledge beyond his grasp.", "yeah i think in that case it's a bit crazy if he had no fruit or veggies etc and his stance was more to prove a point to the mother. I do think ordering multiple meals for the kid to be delivered can def be a budget dealbreaker - I get a lot of delivery but I'm single with no dependants and I have no savings to speak of haha it's a huge money drain", "As someone with multiple food allergies, being thrown out of a birthday party because of your allergies and being labeled as high maintenance is embarrassing and worse than just being given an apple or a bowl of fruit while everyone else eats pasta. YTA.", "So telling him to kick rocks while all his friends have fun is better?", "That poor little boy is probably always going to remember being kicked out of this party\u2639\ufe0f YTA. As someone with dietary restrictions, I\u2019m used to eating something different. I\u2019m sure he would rather have stayed and hung out with his little friends..", "You had a golden opportunity to show your kid and his friends how to handle an unforeseen circumstance with respect for the one who is affected. Instead you basically taught them that it\u2019s okay to exclude their friend if he\u2019s different because it\u2019s too much trouble to attempt to accommodate him.\n\nI would\u2019ve been annoyed at his parent for not making sure I knew about the allergy beforehand, but to take it out on the kid is about the worst way to handle this. \n\nYTA.", "If I was his mother, I would had told you to fuck right off.", "Oh. So this was about YOUR comfort entirely then? YOU didn\u2019t want to feel bad while eating your posts so you THREW HIM OUT? How is that better. Your a selfish moron, asshole.", "An extra $15 to have a kids meal delivered was going to destroy your budget? Doesn't sound like you were in a position to throw a big party. Budget better next time you're taking responsibility for a bunch of kids. At LEAST over $20 wiggle room.", "I grew up poor, but mom always had rice, potatoes, and oatmeal.  You shouldn't  have kids over if your budget is so strapped you can't afford  $10 for additional  food.", "You don\u2019t have eggs? You could love scrambled some eggs. A dozen is 3$ what a blow to your budget", "Okay, but did OP offer that as an option to the mom? Did he say, here are a few simple foods I have on hand (oatmeal, rice eggs). Will either of these choices work, or would you like to order and pay for takeout for your son to eat? And if she said none of the choices OP had on hand would work, and wasn't willing to order her son takeout, then I think it would be reasonable to apologize for the miscommunication and say maybe she should come get her kid. Honestly, I am surprised that as the mom of a celiac kid, she did not call the OP ahead of time to discuss menu, and/or send food along...", "So ask the mother. Is  her jaw broken.", "I mean I still feel like worst case scenario, she should've called the mom and asked. I still feel like unless his diet is so super extreme that she doesn't have a single thing in her pantry to feed him, she needs to at least attempt to be a good host and offer something to eat. It's just how being a host is.", "Really? An unplanned expense such as a meal for one 10 year old was too much to handle? How would you have handled other unexpected expenses? It\u2019s so tacky to host a child and then insist the mother pay for his meal or pick him up.", "She said she was sorry and that the ex knew about it so she forgot to mention. There\u2019s no excuse for the way this person behaved. I\u2019m embarrassed by everyone involved. What a lack of social skills.", "I generally reserve ESH for cases where the parties have a similar level of assitude. In this case it's a communication mixup on one side and selfish laziness (with a hint of ableism for that \"high maintenance\" remark) on the other.", "The OP was such a big asshole that she completely eclipsed the other kids mom, thus I just can\u2019t do E S H", "Ehh if the op hadn\u2019t gone nuclear I would agree. Op just sound\u2019s insufferable. It\u2019s a clear YTA.\n\nEdit: Lol at U/asufutimaehaefutbw_ going absolutely psycho and then blocking me, before I can reply, completely unprovoked. Truly a brave, decent soul. The added touch of them sending a RedditCares was extra hilarious. Truly some excellent projection in the wild.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I agree. Who has the bigger stakes here? The person who hosted a kid with a dietary restriction, or the parent of the kid? God forbid if something happens, who is going to feel worse? The parent of the kid. It\u2019s the responsibility of the parent to inform the host of dietary restrictions of their own kid", "Clearly, but that's not the point. It's a food allergy of which OP was not aware of, nor has any knowledge of said allergy. Again, better safe than sorry.", "Absolutely!!! I\u2019m a full grown adult  who can\u2019t eat gluten and it feels so shitty and isolating eating something different in a group dinner setting, and answering a million questions and having all this weird attention drawn on my food situation, and then being treated like I\u2019m attention seeking for having food issues in the first place. A little kid? He made a little kid leave a birthday party because he couldn\u2019t eat what OP made for dinner? What a dick! OP\u2019s ex and his kid are right to be embarrassed by his ignorant and cruel behaviour. Geez! YTA", "Kid won't EVER forget this.  I can't believe the mother let him come back for other activities.", "It will exceed the budget. I didn't say it would financially cripple me but still exceeds the budget put aside for the weekend that had very clear provisions.\n\nA child allergic to gluten wasn't one of those.", "Researching her options, looking what's in her house and checking in with the mom if it was just 2 kids is a good host.\n\nOP was responsible for 8 kids that night, not 2. Mom didn't even offer simple foods she could make for the kid when she called to confirm.", "Sure, if it was just her kid and one guest. But she's responsible for 8 that night. \n\nShould be focusing on that kid as she looks for something he can eat in her kitchen and possible needing to cook it? While the other 7 are waiting?", "An unplanned expense that can be avoided should be avoided. It wouldn't be a meal but meals while he's here and ordering is not really cheap. At least for me.", "Apologising for doing something wrong doesn't change the fact that you did something wrong...\n\nDon't get me wrong, she just irresponsible and better of than op but still wrong here.", "Fair", "That's fair. He could've and should've handled it more delicately.", "Lol I\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t see their comment history. They are truly a peach with their racist comments", "Lmao literally your entire comment history is arguing and stating your insignificant opinions on everything. Get institutionalized ASAP", "Then amend your budget. Wtf?", "All budgets should have some wiggle room for unexpected issues.", "But your response to the mother of the child in question. \"Provide food, pay for delivery, or pick him up RIGHT NOW\".  Very much suggests that $15 would cripple you. It seems like the reasonable empathetic thing to do would be to order the meal for the kid, then ask the mom if she could reimburse you when she picked him up. But NO, you are SO worried about your almighty budget you kicked a kid out of a birthday party due to an allergy. Do you really not see how much of an asshole you are?", "Don't have a party if you can't afford it. Plus, I'm sure there was something he could eat that you didn't have to buy.", "Unless the other children are babies, she could have served the food and then looked for something  else to feed them.", "It sounded like he was already eating chips and snacks by the time this issue came up, and could eat the salad as well, possibly with whatever meat or seafood she was already going to put on the pasta.\n\n I think you and I just have different expectations about how to treat guests in our home. I consider myself a bad host if I don't make a genuine attempt to feed people who stay at my place, no matter how many I invite.", "And it could have been avoided had you asked if any of the guests had allergies.", "You are NTA. Seriously, who sends their young child off for the weekend without telling the person they are staying with that their child has a food allergy? This is how a classmate of mine died in the 6th grade. My classmate went to stay at a friend\u2019s house for the night and nobody told the people she was with that she had a peanut allergy. The girl ate peanut butter cookies that night and died."]}
