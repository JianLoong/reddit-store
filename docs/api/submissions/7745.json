You shouldn\u2019t have to cater to that, and you wife can continue the friendship/meetups easily enough outside of the house.", "NTA. She sounds absolutely wretched, you're quite right to want to avoid her & her ceaseless stream of complaints.", "NTA\n\n\"they somehow made peace\", is there anything more you can say, it sounds like this awful bully of your wife has again coerced your wife to her viewpoint. It will be difficult for you wife to accept what an awful, manipulate garbage person this *friend* really is.\n\nIt is good you are standing up for your wife, but I would focus on the impact on your wife, i.e. *constant verbal attacks*, rather than *my peace at home she disrupted,* because the latter is veering into AH territory.", "Going against the grain but ymbtah. I agree with you in principal, but your wife needs to break up with her 'friend' on her own.
