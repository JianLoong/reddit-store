That was the final straw for me and I told my wife that I don't care if they are at peace since it was also my wedding she ruined with her drama and my peace at home she disrupted with her constant verbal attacks towards my wife\n\nI told her that I would not agree to have her at our wedding celebration and if she comes into our house I would kick her out again.

She sounds absolutely wretched, you're quite right to want to avoid her & her ceaseless stream of complaints.", "NTA\n\n\"they somehow made peace\", is there anything more you can say, it sounds like this awful bully of your wife has again coerced your wife to her viewpoint. It will be difficult for you wife to accept what an awful, manipulate garbage person this *friend* really is.\n\nIt is good you are standing up for your wife, but I would focus on the impact on your wife, i.e. *constant verbal attacks*, rather than *my peace at home she disrupted,* because the latter is veering into AH territory.", "Going against the grain but ymbtah. I agree with you in principal, but your wife needs to break up with her 'friend' on her own.

My husband actually just did this with one of my long-time friends/family members.  Always negative, complaining, and in attack mode towards me.  I shrug it off, but my husband kicked them out the house and told me she's no longer welcome.  You're standing up for your wife when she keeps compromising with her friend, \"especially with that inability to apologise even after months of shitty behaviour\".

She recognizes it but is clearly in the habit of just letting it happen.  You've not asked your wife to go NC.  You've established a boundary that has to do with your own well-being.  That's not unreasonable.  NTA", "NTA. This woman isn't a friend", "NTA. I don't know about the rest of the world,  but my home is my sanctuary. I would never let anyone get away with treating anyone else this way especially in my home.

Normally she has it easier to stand her ground even if she doesn't like to do so but with this one friend it seems almost impossible for her", "There's only so much you can take standing idly by while you watch a bully break down someone you love.", "Nta ! The friend is toxic and knows how to manipulate and gaslight your significant other!\nIt's good that you put your foot down and created a border!

That person is not a friend at all.", "NTA. And honestly. I'd say that YOU deserve an apology from this friend as well. To your face. If she can't or won't then the banishing continues.

Just..... urg. What a terrible 'friend'. I'm sure it's hard to see your wife treated that way.", "NTA. People are usually more willing to put up with BS themselves, but once it involved their loved ones, that\u2019s where they draw the line. Your wife is fine putting up with this AH of a friend, but you love your wife and aren\u2019t willing to let her go through with that abuse.", "Your wife does NOT have a good friend. After all her awful behavior, I do not blame you one second for not wanting her in your house or at your wedding celebration. NTA", "NTA. I would love someone try to tell me to lock my dog away. Fuck that. Don\u2019t come to my house if you\u2019re afraid of dogs (and my dog is consistently praised by our trainer and friends because he\u2019s so chill).\n\nAnd the wedding dates? For real? This woman just wants everything to be about her. You set your boundaries, but didn\u2019t overstep your wife\u2019s.   She can hang with whoever, but that person doesn\u2019t get free reign in your life and home.", "NTA I had a friend who was very manipulative, and I didn't see it. I spent the first 8 yrs of my marriage in tears feeling like I was doing something bad by loving my husband and not moving back to the state my friend lived in. Thank God my husband hung in there. It took me several years to go completely NC with her. \n\n5 yrs NC and I feel sane, and happy in my life. Toxic friends can affect relationships so much. \n\nKeep your boundaries up, your wife will see your doing for her best interests, hopefully.", "ESH.  The friend sounds exhausting.

Dogs don\u2019t respect personal space, they smell and shed and plenty of people don\u2019t want to be assaulted by them\u2014it\u2019s common courtesy if you have a guest that doesn\u2019t like them.", "Disagree. He said he\u2019s not demanding her to get rid of this person, she\u2019s just not welcome in his space. That\u2019s his boundary. That\u2019s fine. She can still get together with her, but OP just doesn\u2019t want to deal with her BS at his house or in his important life events.

Time to push the Rocker into the water and be done with it", "Lol if you think having a dog around you is physical assault you need therapy. If you are a PITA and expect people to cater just to you, you are delusional. This isn\u2019t even like a thread a while back with someone who had an allergy. Gtfo with that bs.", "Nope. Your house. Your rules. She can see her friends elsewhere", "NTA You have every right to remove a toxic person from your life,  even if it's your wife's \"friend\". This lady has been catered to for so long that's she expects to be hoisted up to her throne at every moment. She also had been so abusive for so long that she also expects people to anticipate her needs and wants in order to make sure she's happy and doesn't make a fuss. \n\nI feel bad for this lady's husband and kids.", "No over reacting at all. Spot on, actually. It could have gone sideways by demanding she drop her as a friend, but you wisely told her if she wants to accept emotional terrorism that's on her, but it will no longer be tolerated at your home. My SIL was suppose to stay with my wife and I for a week due to a move, but since the roommates she was gonna go with bailed she ended up staying with us.....for 3 months. After one too many instance I put my foot down and said while I'm not going to leave you, your sister is negatively affecting our relationship and she needs to go. She is now mooching off her mother in a different state, no longer a problem to me.", "NTA. This is a historical friend. Like a friend from history who hasn't really been a good friend for a long time but gets hysterical when that truth is raised. Some history should just remain in the past. Often, historical events (and friends) don't  look as good when subject to scrutiny.", "Why on earth does your wife want to keep this PITA as a friend?  If someone treated me the way she has treated your wife, I would throw them out with the trash.", "This right here.
