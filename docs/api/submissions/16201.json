For his sixteenth birthday, the plan was to let him skip school, get to the DMV when it opens, take the driving test, go on a small road trip, be back around when school gets out and then all go out for a family dinner. On the weekend would be his celebration with his friends. Skipping school for the DMV test was planned in advance, but the road trip was a surprise.\n\nA few days before the road trip my wife asked me to take our three year old with me that day. I said I wasn't taking a toddler to the DMV; that place is a cesspit. Also the road trip is for additional driving practice before he's able to drive unsupervised. A toddler distracting him is not a good idea. My wife said she wanted the day to herself and if I wasn't willing to take our toddler, the birthday stuff needs to be moved to the weekend so I can.\n\nI said I would take our toddler to work with me the next day, but our oldest's birthday is his day, so he's the priority. She got angry and said she's made a hundred sacrifices for our kids, and saying she isn't a priority (not what I said) is disgusting. It was a big fight. My son's birthday she texted me that I'm an asshole multiple times. At the dinner she was in a bad mood.\n\nAfter everyone ate my dad asked us all to go out to the parking lot. He handed the keys to his car to my son, saying he was getting a new one. He also said he would continue to pay the insurance for a year. My wife asked me if I knew about this, and I didn't. She didn't believe me.\n\nMy wife has called and texted my dad multiple times asking if he is going to do this for all of our kids, saying he shouldn't have done this without asking us first and telling him if he can't do this for all the kids, he needs to take the car back. Eventually he told her shut up and stop bothering him. My wife told me I need to stop talking to my dad. She said he used offensive language (he texted \"stop bothering me woman\" which she says is sexist) towards her and I need to support her. I said she needs to stop talking to my dad, not me. I'll support her not talking to him.\n\nMy wife said I am disrespecting her, that I won't listen when she says she needs help and let my family treat her poorly. I think she is creating these situations herself. She looks for offense and then finds it.

You don't mention why your wife needs the day off, why you don't have a problem with your father's gift even though he didn't tell you about it, why when your wife said she felt she wasn't the priority, you didn't realize there was a communication problem or how you responded. \n\nI'm gonna say ESH, but really, your father was out of line. Nobody buys a 16 year old a car without discussing it with his parents first. That's just wrong.

Hiring a babysitter to watch the three year old should have been considered so she could have a day and you could still be with your son getting his license.  As far as your dad goes,  his comment is sexist.  I would not like to be spoken to that way either.  But having them not talk to each other now makes sense.  As far as the car-  super generous gift BUT he should have spoken to the two of you first.  Not every parent wants their child to have \u2018free rein\u2019 to go anywhere any time.  Having oversight of a 16 year olds coming and goings as a parent gets trumped when the car is his versus driving mom and dads car.  Even if she was on board with accepting the car the two of you could have set ground rules for it in advance.  She feels disrespected by your dad and that you don\u2019t see her sheer exhaustion.", "Personally (as a women) i don't See anything wrong with what he said, honestly. Your wife is really making a big deal out of this even tho it's really not, i don't see where she is coming from. It was your oldest's birthday, he should be the priority then and yes having kids means you have to sacrifice some things, thats what you sign up for when having kids.", "ESH- Not sure why your wife needed that day to herself.

Your father should know better, and should never shut her down like that.", "NTA. Is your oldest son not her biological kid?", "NTA on the surface....but there seems to be a lot more going on in the background here. Kinda weird how she reacted to the car being a gift though.

I don't feel she should be trying to control you and tell you who are allowed to talk to.  It would be different if there was a pattern of abuse.  \n\nHowever I do think you have handled the situation poorly with the car.  She makes a good point that it's unfair for one kid to get a car and the others may not get anything.  Your dad shouldn't be disrespecting her either even if he was provoked by her chatter.   You should have a talk with him and let her know that you will.", "NTA! Your wife is looking for issues with everyone.", "NTA, is your wife normally so quick to jump to conflict? Or are these just one offs? Honestly the day off. I can maybe see that she really needed a day off. Little kids are exhausting.  But she should be able to understand the reasons why it's not a good idea to take the little one. \n\nNow the gift is just inexcusable. Your dad gave a gift to your almost adult son. This really shouldn't concern her. She's trying to guilt your dad into giving more for your other kids? Just a strange fight to pick in my opinion. But 100% keep talking to your dad. If she doesn't like it then that's on her. \n\nI'm one to have my wife's back through and through. But this is a situation where I would push back hard against her.", "There is problem with your dad behaviour towards your wife but also idk why your wife wanted to move your son birthday to have that day for herself? Quite weird. I feel like something missing. ESH I guess quite everyone wrong here.", "INFO:  Was your wife part of the initial planning for your son's birthday, or was that planned between you and your oldest?  Also, has your father ever mentioned helping get all the kids cars when they turn 16, or brought the issue up at all?", "NTA. But it sounds like your wife needs some alone time. Can you get the 3 year old into a nursery part time?", "ESH is your wife jealous of your son for some reason? Not sure why she specifically needed you to take your toddler on his birthday.

First, you neglected to mention that you have six kids! Of course your wife wants a day to herself. Also, you say that your father has spoken to her this way before. That sucks! I'm sure she's feeling disrespected in a thousand different ways.

Gifting a used car that could be traded in or used as a down payment to a family with lots of kids and presumably stretched finances isnt such a jerk move.

She was bothering him, harassing him.

If she's been hounding him for giving a nice gift, he probably does feel pretty exasperated.\n\nOf course, grandad should have given the parents a heads up, but grandparents are gonna pull this crap every so often, because they wanna spoil their grand babies.

Man doesn't carry that same connotation.", "That still makes her an ah though. Individual time with a parent and child is very important. Especially on a milestone day like oldest child's sixteenth birthday. Taking her husband up on his offer to take the toddler to work with him the next day would have been a reasonable compromise. Insisting the husband also take another day off to watch the toddler would have worked too. Absolutely insisting you must have your break from the toddler on the 16 year olds birthday is ridiculous.", "She is being unreasonable in the first situation no matter which way it\u2019s framed by OP. She\u2019d be taking away something special from her son on his birthday because she wants a day to herself.

She doesn't even seems like she wants a day off but to ruin her son's birthday, if it was about break she could've gotten it but she wanted it on that specific date ONLY, she even went as far as telling him to push her son's birthday event. Why does she wants to take a break just that day only? \n\nHonestly, the mom seems to hold some kind of grudge against the oldest, she didn't like the idea of him receiving a car either.

Had this AITA revolved around literally any other day, I'd agree that he is, but I think how much he helps/doesn't help is a completely separate issue.
