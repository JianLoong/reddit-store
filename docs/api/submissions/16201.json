For his sixteenth birthday, the plan was to let him skip school, get to the DMV when it opens, take the driving test, go on a small road trip, be back around when school gets out and then all go out for a family dinner. On the weekend would be his celebration with his friends. Skipping school for the DMV test was planned in advance, but the road trip was a surprise.\n\nA few days before the road trip my wife asked me to take our three year old with me that day. I said I wasn't taking a toddler to the DMV; that place is a cesspit. Also the road trip is for additional driving practice before he's able to drive unsupervised. A toddler distracting him is not a good idea. My wife said she wanted the day to herself and if I wasn't willing to take our toddler, the birthday stuff needs to be moved to the weekend so I can.\n\nI said I would take our toddler to work with me the next day, but our oldest's birthday is his day, so he's the priority. She got angry and said she's made a hundred sacrifices for our kids, and saying she isn't a priority (not what I said) is disgusting. It was a big fight. My son's birthday she texted me that I'm an asshole multiple times. At the dinner she was in a bad mood.\n\nAfter everyone ate my dad asked us all to go out to the parking lot. He handed the keys to his car to my son, saying he was getting a new one. He also said he would continue to pay the insurance for a year. My wife asked me if I knew about this, and I didn't. She didn't believe me.\n\nMy wife has called and texted my dad multiple times asking if he is going to do this for all of our kids, saying he shouldn't have done this without asking us first and telling him if he can't do this for all the kids, he needs to take the car back. Eventually he told her shut up and stop bothering him. My wife told me I need to stop talking to my dad. She said he used offensive language (he texted \"stop bothering me woman\" which she says is sexist) towards her and I need to support her. I said she needs to stop talking to my dad, not me. I'll support her not talking to him.\n\nMy wife said I am disrespecting her, that I won't listen when she says she needs help and let my family treat her poorly. I think she is creating these situations herself. She looks for offense and then finds it.

You don't mention why your wife needs the day off, why you don't have a problem with your father's gift even though he didn't tell you about it, why when your wife said she felt she wasn't the priority, you didn't realize there was a communication problem or how you responded. \n\nI'm gonna say ESH, but really, your father was out of line. Nobody buys a 16 year old a car without discussing it with his parents first. That's just wrong.

Hiring a babysitter to watch the three year old should have been considered so she could have a day and you could still be with your son getting his license.  As far as your dad goes,  his comment is sexist.  I would not like to be spoken to that way either.  But having them not talk to each other now makes sense.  As far as the car-  super generous gift BUT he should have spoken to the two of you first.  Not every parent wants their child to have \u2018free rein\u2019 to go anywhere any time.  Having oversight of a 16 year olds coming and goings as a parent gets trumped when the car is his versus driving mom and dads car.  Even if she was on board with accepting the car the two of you could have set ground rules for it in advance.  She feels disrespected by your dad and that you don\u2019t see her sheer exhaustion.", "Personally (as a women) i don't See anything wrong with what he said, honestly. Your wife is really making a big deal out of this even tho it's really not, i don't see where she is coming from. It was your oldest's birthday, he should be the priority then and yes having kids means you have to sacrifice some things, thats what you sign up for when having kids.", "ESH- Not sure why your wife needed that day to herself.

Your father should know better, and should never shut her down like that.", "NTA. Is your oldest son not her biological kid?", "NTA on the surface....but there seems to be a lot more going on in the background here. Kinda weird how she reacted to the car being a gift though.

I don't feel she should be trying to control you and tell you who are allowed to talk to.  It would be different if there was a pattern of abuse.  \n\nHowever I do think you have handled the situation poorly with the car.  She makes a good point that it's unfair for one kid to get a car and the others may not get anything.  Your dad shouldn't be disrespecting her either even if he was provoked by her chatter.   You should have a talk with him and let her know that you will.", "NTA! Your wife is looking for issues with everyone.", "NTA, is your wife normally so quick to jump to conflict?

But she should be able to understand the reasons why it's not a good idea to take the little one. \n\nNow the gift is just inexcusable. Your dad gave a gift to your almost adult son. This really shouldn't concern her. She's trying to guilt your dad into giving more for your other kids? Just a strange fight to pick in my opinion. But 100% keep talking to your dad. If she doesn't like it then that's on her. \n\nI'm one to have my wife's back through and through.

Does she make a hundred sacrifices for your kids and get ignored when she asks for a day to herself?  Just because you have kids doesn't mean that you also neglect your partner - which goes for both of you.\n\n>My wife asked me if I knew about this, and I didn't. She didn't believe me.\n\nTo be fair, that's a *big* gift, and one that *should* have been communicated in advance.

He's kind of an asshole for not communicating - Not for giving the car, but not *telling you, the parents of the child receiving it*.\n\n>and telling him if he can't do this for all the kids, he needs to take the car back.\n\nYeah, because she doesn't want your other 5 kids to think grandpa is playing favorites or loves them less.\n\n>Eventually he told her shut up and stop bothering him.\n\nAgain, he needs to communicate.

No one should have to stop talking to him, he should *start* talking about the things that were relevant and important.\n\n>I'll support her not talking to him.\n\nYou saying \"You need to stop talking to him but I'm going to keep doing it\" is not supporting.\n\n>My wife said I am disrespecting her, that I won't listen when she says she needs help and let my family treat her poorly.\n\n...I mean just from this post, you come across as a bit disrespectful of her, you didn't listen when she told you she needed a day to herself, and you let your dad treat her poorly.\n\n>I think she is creating these situations herself.\n\nIt sounds like she asked reasonable questions of your dad after his unannounced actions, got ignored until he snapped at her, and you did nothing but say \"I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing\".

This effort has cost associated for my relatives, and sometimes a substantial one.\n\nBut myself, my siblings, and my cousins, never knew.\n\nIn OPs case its poor communication from grandpa, but I could see a similar thought being in grandpas mind.\n\n>The way the grandfather handed the 16yo the keys, I will bet you money he expects to take that car to college with him, and will start a fight if he's not allowed to.  Not to mention that grandpa is only paying the insurance for 1 year.  Does the 16yo have a job?  Or will mom and dad be expected to pay after that, and can they afford that? \n\nOn this note - once we were given help the follow through was on us. The expectations were clear \"This car is now yours. Ill pay X, you'll pay for X. If you mess it up the mess is yours.\" Its fully possible thats the deal, with the expectation that paying 1 year of insurance will help the grandson get his feet under him in regaurds to cost before taking on the whole thing. But it should be a conversation grandpa has with the kid.", "They are at school if you read OP\u2019s comments so yeah she\u2019d only have to look after the 3 year old, but the fact that she\u2019s not willing to do it the next day tells me she\u2019s just trying to ruin her sons birthday. A son that she didn\u2019t want by the way if you look at OPs other comments.", "NTA. The attempt to manipulate your dad into buying cars for all the kids and to try to get you to stop talking to your dad is insane. She\u2019s the one being disrespectful IMO. The car was a gift to your oldest on his 16th. End of story.", "For what it\u2019s worth, I really hate when people use \u201cwoman\u201d like that. There\u2019s just something that gives it a negative connotation.", "She wanted her SONS BIRTHDAY all to herself?? Please be fr", "And one of them is likely disabled. OP said in another comment their next kid is 11 and she\u2019ll likely never drive.", "No joke. Neither parent is getting a break for themselves until a few of them move out. Who has SIX kids and thinks they'll get a moment of peace for the next 20 years?", "I think it's a combination of envy and fear of losing help.  Driving means independence and freedom for teenagers, and OP's wife sounds like she could use some.  And odds are that since the kid is the oldest and he's been stuck at home, he helps out more than a little.  If he has a car, he can escape.", "Meh, I was one of 5 kids. Oldest two siblings (a year apart in age) were gifted a (used) car by my aunt and uncle. The rest of us did not. Aunt and uncle\u2019s financial situation changed and they couldn\u2019t afford to do so. Our parents couldn\u2019t afford to buy us cars either. It is what it is. None of us were ever upset about not getting our own cars. That one car just became a *shared* car and no one complained about it because we all understood. Teach your kids to be grateful and share with each other, problem solved.", ">Being overworked is totally legit, I'm not questioning that.\n\nWife is obviously a SAHM - the day in question is a weekday but there is no daycare for the 3 year old. I get that caring for small children is tiring, but in this day and age where being a single-income family with a SAHM is a luxury, having to care for kids by yourself between 8-5 M-F is the price you pay for choosing to stay at home. Dad is taking off work to do parenting work this day, standing in line for hours at the DMV is no picnic either, and offered to take the toddler off the wife's hands for a \"day to herself\" another day by taking the toddler to work with him, even if that meant all the difficulty of trying to get work done while caring for a toddler.\n\nHaving been raised by a lazy, entitled, emotionally abusive SAHM, I have very little patience for them now.", "Agree.  I understand any stay at home parent needing a break from a toddler, but why does it HAVE to be that day?", "She sounds jealous imo, of her own kid which i can't even fathom but she sounds so frickin jealous", "Yes, there's some kind of resentment toward the oldest son. First the toddler, then being angry about the generous gift of a CAR. It's like she's jealous of him. Maybe she resents the attention he's getting? Why doesn't she want her kid to have a good birthday?", "It feels deliberate, and she's so angry that something she planned on didn't happen because OP refused to take the toddler. There's levels to her AH behavior.", "Yes, me too. He even says that he offered to take the three-year-old with him to work a different day and she refused. That and getting mad about the car *unless* the grandfather agreed to give all the kids a car, is what makes me think she has an issue with her oldest child. She seems determined to make his birthday crappy. That is effed up.\n\nIf you are concerned about fairness to the other kids or getting time off, bring it up a different day.", "I am so sorry that you had a narcissistic parent. In some ways, they're so horribly predictable. One of the other things narcissists do, without fail, is find a way to ruin any event that isn't about them. Having a birthday? They'll have some sort of problem that steals the focus. On vacation? Something will go wrong in their world that will throw a soggy blanket over the whole group. Christmas? That's the ideal time to go silent or sullen. They make it so you don't have anything enjoyable all your own. I so hope you've been able to put her in a compartment where she can't sabotage you anymore.", "They're both involved in creating a baby.", "There are two separate issues. On the issue about the car, actually the wife is right. A gift that large should be run by the parents, especially as it sets a weird precedent that could lead to difficult feelings with the other children.", "I think it's fair to be worried that the younger kids might now have unreasonable expectations for their own 16th birthdays, but she is definitely in the wrong for how she talked to her father in law about it", "The problem it's not getting a car, the problem is one child getting preferential treatment.", "Rather than a narcissist too? I started with \"either that\" and ended with with questions about her behaviour.", "I'm sorry that you have to deal with that. I know that it's your.mom but just as soon as you can run, run. It is so toxic and will make you be scared to do anything or say anything due to always getting berated or mentally abused if you do. Also if you haven't already seek therapy. \n\nI hope you are well and happy.", "It\u2019s so far in the future to flip out about it now is just ridiculous. Worry about it in 5+ years when (and if) the 11yo is able to drive or longer if it\u2019s the next child.", "The NOISE I just made XD in home performance of an Ibsen play, oh my god. SPOT ON.", "Holy shit dude, why did you go along with that for three kids?!\n\nSix kids\u2026 Jesus I hope you\u2019re rich.", "When was the last time she told any of your sons \"I love you\"?", "Ugh my mum was notorious for freaking out and ruining holidays/vacations with her bullshit.\n\nShe pulled some shit at my law school graduation and that was it for me.", "Well, at least now you can pick your family.", "Thank you for saying this. Sage advice for anyone suffering from a narcissistic relationship. Thankfully I went no contact with her when I turned 30 and she died a few years ago.  No one cared that she did.  My life got infinitely better when I cut her out of it. I hadn\u2019t realized how much she undermined me and created chaos and drama for me until I removed her from my life.

To me, that makes no sense.", "Yeahhh but her behavior is still AHish. Why does her break have to be *that day*? It\u2019s sus", "OP also mentioned that his wife was the one who wanted more children, and implied that he stopped her from going over 6", "They have 6 kids because she wanted another daughter, so she insisted on  keep trying until OP got a vasectomy. I think the mom doesn't like boys in general as my mom.", "I think they\u2019re something being left out. Like there\u2019s just something off about the last paragraph for sure.", "Regardless of the family dynamics the wife could let the kids have one day to enjoy his birthday without having to worry about helping out with a sibling (that I guarantee he does a lot).  Also it\u2019s silly to make him give back a hand me down car because the grandfather might not need a new car every time one of the kids turns 16.", "Even if they have 6 kids wtf would make you want to have a day to yourself on your oldest kids birthday?", "But he offered to take the toddler the very next day?  Why did it have to be that day?", "6? Fuck I dont even want 1", "I'd bet anything that mom is freaked out by the idea of the 16 year old having a car because now he won't be around to help her with the other 5 kids and that fear probably triggered this unhinged behavior.", "They have six children, including a disabled child.\n\n\nShe's probably parentified the eldest a lot- if the eldest gets their liscence they'll have an easier time going out.\n\nWithout a liscence the kids stuck at home helping out around the house", "Today", "Good for you! I'm still dealing with mine due to us having kids together. When I remarried she went off the deep end and has refused to allow me to see my girls for a year now. I have placed her in contempt and they finally served her but the system is backed up. After not being able to contact my children for so long she has brainwashed them. I got a phone call from them the other day was really excited only for her to tell my youngest to tell me what she wanted to say. My 10 year old then proceeded to tell me she didn't want to live with me or see me ever again. She claimed my oldest didn't even want to speak with me come to find out she was at her grandma's. Even though I know it's not them truly feeling this way it destroyed me. My wife and family made me check in and get help. I'm home now with my wife and feeling some better.

Yeah that's not happening.", "The only place I agree with OP\u2019s wife is that you don\u2019t just gift someone else\u2019s 16-year-old child a car without running it past the parents first. They may have had boundaries in mind for their new driver that just became way harder to enforce because \u201cyou didn\u2019t give me the car so you can\u2019t tell me when I can & can\u2019t drive it.\u201d", "Cat vibes in wanting new water because the water poured two hours ago isn't good enough.

It was weird.", "When was the last time she said it to your oldest?", "It's life when you had 6 kids that you clearly weren't emotionally equipped for. \n\nYour wife doesn't like your son because he was unplanned, based on your comments. That's fucked up in and of itself. If she didn't want another child at that time, she should've aborted. Only ever have kids if you have the emotional bandwidth to love them. \n\nIn another comment, you also mentioned that you had more kids because your wife wanted a girl. Also a fucked up reason to, in the words of another commender, breed to the point of exhaustion. \n\nI'm sorry, but the two of you brought this upon yourselves, and I suspect that your son is abundantly aware that mom doesn't like him. Good for grandpa for giving him a car so he can get the fuck away from you all.", "TBF, when you find out the mother of your kids has cheated it's a totally legitimate question.", "I don't know.", "NTA\n\nYour son's birthday is not about your wife or toddler, nor is your dad giving your son a car about your wife or toddler.\n\nThe way she acts about your son, it comes across as if she isn't his birth mother and is completely disconnected from him. The fact that she is his mother, this is just bizarrely entitled and incredibly rude. You even offered to give her a break the next day, but that wasn't good enough. Instead of being grateful to your dad, she started making demands.\n\nIs this new behavior? Or old behavior that you're just starting to realize isn't normal?", "Your wife is a hassle. And exhausting. NTA.", "NTA. My parents gifted us the car that my son is driving\u2026my mom got a new one and gave him her old one. I would never think of demanding that they make the same arrangement for my other kid or take back the car. And I was never given a car (new or old) by my parents, but my brother was. He needed one. I didn\u2019t. And my parents have done lots to help each of us out over the years. Maybe your dad should have talked to you guys first and let him know that was his plan, but I think your wife was out of line for chewing him out.", "NTA.

Idk why she thought her sons 16th birthday was a great opportunity for \"me time\" for herself. If she had a surprise for your son, then she should have looped you in. If it was just about her wanting a break, she could have brought it up and planned it with you better. Taking a toddler to the dmv and a road trip with a new driver is absolutely a horrible idea.\nThe rest feels like she was just taking out her anger out on your father, and all he's guilty of was giving your son a car. Y'all have plenty of time to figure out another car for the next child who's ready to drive.\nSounds like you two need to have a conversation about where all of that came from if its not already an established pattern from her.", "That\u2019s a punishment for your older child.", "NTA - your wife needs therapy. What mother thinks she trumps their kid on their birthday?! Wtf. Is the boy actually hers?she\u2019s giving off awful step mother vibes so if he is her kids that\u2019s even more of a red flag. She is the one being disrespectful by not respecting when another adult asks her to stop messaging them. Who exactly does she think she is?", "NTA your wife in the course of one day was selfish, demanding, entitled, rude, and generally the cause of her own problems that are now problems for the people around her", "Nta. \n\nYour wife is craving your attention though. I mean first she wants to mess with your pre-planned birthday activities,  wants you to change the date even!!\n\nThen she is upset your dad got your son a car?! I understand she wants equality between the kids, but to ask him to give all the kids a car is pretty demanding, and to ask him to take it back is heartbreaking.  \n\nIs this eldest son from a different marriage? Seems she is defending the other kids against him a little. Most moms would be happy they got help at all, while she is looking to be sure your son doesn't get more. \n\nEither way, I think she is trying to feel important to you. Maybe she is narcissistic and can't stand not having the attention. Maybe she just wants to feel like she is more important to you than your son is. Maybe take her away for the weekend to help her out emotionally if you think this may be the case.\n\nBut do let your kid have his day and his car!!", "NTA, I also wouldn't have allowed her to talk to my dad that way.

I would also restate the fact that she better not talk to your dad again.", "The 16 year old getting a car will help take a load off both parents by him being able to drive the younger siblings around to appointments and extracurriculars, provided he is a safe driver.

Everyone is focusing on the fact the wife asked OP to take the toddler for the day but are ignoring the fact that it really has nothing to do with the question being asked. The real answer is ESH. Yes, wife is being a little over the top, but also Dad shouldn't have gifted your MINOR son a car without discussing it with you first and you also suck because your wife is asking some very valid questions and your dad is just brushing her off.
