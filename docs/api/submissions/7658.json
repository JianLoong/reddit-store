Sam has a bestfriend  Joaquin also 15M who hes know since they were 5. Joaquin  lives right down the street and has spent the night countless times with no issue. he's a good kid and we're friends with his parents.\n\nUntil now I assumed Joaquin was straight as far as I knew I've only ever heard the kid talk/ask about girls or advice with girls and he had a girlfriend for a while. So even after     Sam came out I was perfectly ok with Joaquin continuing to stay the night. That is until over the weekend when I got up in the middle night to pee and decided to check on the boys. I caught them making out in Sam's room. Apparently Joaquin is Bi and theyd started dating a few months back under my nose.\n\nI probably got more upset then I needed to  and yelled at Joaquin to pack his stuff and to go home and I yelled at Sam that Joaquin is banned from staying the night anymore and that he was to have his door open at all times when Sam was over. I told him he was grounded fir the next two weeks for abusing my trust.  He argued back that I was being unfair and I let his older brother (18) straight have his friends over a night and sometimes his girlfriend and that I wasn't treating them the same. I reminded him that his brother was 18 and in college and he still says it's a double standard and that I embarrassed him yelling like that.

For all you know, Joaquin wanted his sexuality to be kept a secret because he's not ready to come out or doesn't have the support he needs. You freaking out has probably done more harm than good in that regard.\n\nYou're right that your other son has different rules because he's older, and Sam might not like it but that's how it is.

I'd question him as to why he didn't share;  I'd be willing to bet it was because deep down, he KNEW it would change how you handled sleepovers.  Work out how you want to handle things in the future under your roof and set the rules, point out that age does make a difference, that brother never had gf's spend the night at 15 because it simply wasn't allowed.  Also, use caution as you are not aware if Joaquin's parents are aware of his sexuality...find out, and if they are aware - maybe include them on setting the boundaries moving forward.  Yet use caution that those boundaries are no more nor no less than what you've already put in place with the older brother.", "I'm gonna say NTA before your reaction wasn't anything to do with him being gay, it was the betrayal of trust and that he's 15,and I think you'd have reacted the same way if he was straight/ if it was a daughter. Parents are always hung up on their kids having sex and most dont want to sanction underage intercourse. I accept that him being gay does make this situation slightly more nuanced as you don't ever want your son thinking that that is the problem, but it doesn't sound like it is, so he'll understand that eventually.", "NTA \nThey are both underage and if he can\u2019t understand the difference between that and his of age sibling then he is definitely not as mature as he thinks he is!", "The reasoning is sound, but handled all wrong.

Lots of children and non parents commenting. \n\n1. OP is not upset that his son was kissing a boy. He's not homophobic. It has nothing to do with him being gay. Do you all lack reading comprehension? Did you miss the part where his straight brother was not allowed to have girlfriends spend the night until he was 18. They are being treated the same, whether straight or gay. \n\n2. It's laughable that so many people are trying to brush off that they were just kissing. That it's improbable, they would try to have sex. Making out very frequently leads to sex. Anyone that says otherwise is delusional. \n\n3. The problem with 15 yr olds having sex is that they lack the maturity and responsibility to have sex safely. (See teen pregnancy as proof of this fact.) And while they don't have to worry about teen pregnancy for their gay son, STDs are still a concern for all unprotected sex (gay or straight). And OP's job as a parent is to protect his child. Even from himself. \n\n4. Op is upset that his son lied ans his the fact thay he was dating Koaquin in order to have his bf seems the night which he very likely is very well aware is a no-no in his house as his brother had the same rule. \n\nNow, a soft YTA to OP. OP handled this quote poorly, but let's give OP some grace here. We all don't handle every situation perfectly. We are all susceptible to knee-jerk overreacting. Otherwise, we wouldn't need AITA. And it's great to sit on your toilet, scrolling reddit, not in the heat of the moment to think of how you would have handled this so much better. \n\nIdeally, you pull son aside in the moment, tell him you're upset he lied (lied by omission at the very least) and broke a rule of no partners staying over and they'd discuss this more in the morning after OP takes the bf home. Then you have a conversation about safe sex and the risks, and how you'd prefer they wait until they are more mature and responsible, but that you were also a kid and know that doesn't always happen. Offer to buy condoms. Maybe even have some on hand to give son during the conversation with the sentiment that if son is going to do it, be safe. That OP will provide them if son or bf is too embarrassed to buy condoms themselves. Ideally. That didn't happen though, so now OP needs to sit son down. Apologize for the knee jerk reaction, explain the reason for grounding is for lying and breaking the no partners sleeping over rule. And then have the aforementioned talk with son.", "NTA.

Obviously, if it is, you need to work on that.\n\nHe's 15.  There are legalities to consider.  The boyfriend is a minor too, so there's another family to consider.  Older son is his own legal person and not your responsibility (other than moral ones).  This isn't a double standard, it's two people in different places of life.  I presume it wouldn't be a problem anymore in 3 years.  Conversely, your son sees his older brother having the relationships he wants for himself and that's gotta hurt.  Plus, he's still learning about his emotions and all that, he's not properly equipped to handle this disappointment.  It's just a shit situation without bad actors", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH.

Gay, married dude here, also raised a kid. I think you know your tone was probably out of wack and you might be conflating a make out with something more. Apologize for that and tell him you didn't mean to embarrass him. Especially because kids can already be embarrassed about their sexuality and sexual expression, regardless of how they identify. I think it's totally valid to want underage kids, that are your responsibility, to refrain from having sex. And that's the real fear here, right?

Obviously nobody\u2019s going to accidentally get pregnant, so as long as Sam knows about safe sex, what\u2019s really the issue here?

Sam has a bestfriend  Joaquin also 15M who hes know since they were 5. Joaquin  lives right down the street and has spent the night countless times with no issue. he's a good kid and we're friends with his parents.\n\nUntil now I assumed Joaquin was straight as far as I knew I've only ever heard the kid talk/ask about girls or advice with girls and he had a girlfriend for a while. So even after     Sam came out I was perfectly ok with Joaquin continuing to stay the night. That is until over the weekend when I got up in the middle night to pee and decided to check on the boys. I caught them making out in Sam's room. Apparently Joaquin is Bi and theyd started dating a few months back under my nose.\n\nI probably got more upset then I needed to  and yelled at Joaquin to pack his stuff and to go home and I yelled at Sam that Joaquin is banned from staying the night anymore and that he was to have his door open at all times when Sam was over. I told him he was grounded fir the next two weeks for abusing my trust.  He argued back that I was being unfair and I let his older brother (18) straight have his friends over a night and sometimes his girlfriend and that I wasn't treating them the same. I reminded him that his brother was 18 and in college and he still says it's a double standard and that I embarrassed him yelling like that. AITA here ?\n\nI might be the asshole for reacting the way I did. For possibly creating a double standard and getting so mad that I yelled at them the way I did.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Scared he'll get pregnant? Get stds? \nHow did he betray your trust? Because you assumed the kid was straight and \"safe\" and he wasn't?\nDid you ever make any rule he's not allowed to have romantic partners until he's older? (He'll hate you for that too, straight kids get to kiss eachother.)\n\nAlso why give the other kid advice and let him ask about girls, then freak out when he is with your son?\n\nAlso they amount that you say your fine with it? In my experience, they parents that are fine only have to say it once, the sneaky ones say it lots, and then punish their kids for falling for their trap.\n\nYeshua dude, you're discriminatory to your kid and won't admit it to yourself.", "YTA don't wonder why your son goes NC with your homaphobix ass the second he moves out", "YTA for overreacting OP.

Think about it, because I get lowkey subconscious homophobic vibes from your reaction.\n\nALSO, your son and Joaquin are DATING, and you just made an impression on your kid\u2019s significant other, and not really in a good way.

Instead, you should have used the opportunity to talk about transparency, sex safety, and why it matters.\n\n2) Gay relationships do not have the same opportunities in the sun as straight relationships. Your son and his friend may not feel comfortable holding hands, going to the movies together, going out for dinner together, kissing in public, and so on. They took to the privacy of the home because that was the space they had away from the prying eye of a homophobic society. \n\n3) As uncomfortable as it may be for a parent, it's a blatant fact that most teenagers have sex. You need to be mature when confronted with those kinds of realities. That doesn't mean your hand is forced to be accommodating, but it would have been much better had you not blown up. \n\nI think most commenters here are missing the point. The focus seems to be on whether you're an AH for the standards of your house, but that's not what you asked. What you asked, I think, is whether you were an AH for blowing up.

Should OP get mad if they catch their kid making out? No. They can explain that they should be safe about it, and let them know that if they ever get into an unsafe situation, they can come to them about it. Overreacting and kicking Joaquin out is just telling Sam that OP is not someone he can trust, and if he ever does get into a bad situation, he's going to keep it to himself.\n\nPlus, alcohol and making out are not really a great comparison anyway.

But we\u2019re talking 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s here, and in my small town, everyone was presumed straight. And to be honest, I think we all just assumed that we *were* straight. The idea of sexual orientation being fluid was unheard of, and we didn\u2019t really have kids at my school who were openly gay or bi. I didn\u2019t really come to terms with my own sexuality until recently. \n\nSo to me, not letting your daughter\u2019s boyfriend spend the night in her room made perfect sense, because experimentation could easily lead to sex, which could lead to a teen pregnancy.
