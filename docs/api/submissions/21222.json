I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re just now noticing, but your husband is a complete misogynistic asshole.", "NTA --- At 55 your husband should 1 know where the kitchen is and 2 where everything is in the kitchen and how it all works he's not useless and can look after himself and your kids.", "NTA but why did you marry a 55 year old child?", "NTA... Does your husband have 2 hands?", "NTA - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s strange to assume after a late buffet lunch that there would be no formal dinner. I think 11 is the borderline age of when I would expect a kid to be able to make something basic for themself and your 14 year old certainly can. Cooking the roast definitely gave them an option.\n\nYour husband is definitely a bit of TA. Unless you have some clearly defined contract of living arrangements based on 1950s social convention he can fend for himself and the kids if he\u2019s so worried about not having a dinner.", "NTA. But your husband is. Why couldn\u2019t he provide a balanced meal if he was so concerned? He\u2019s the father right so he plays a pretty important role and should feed his children.", "Nta but your husband is an old fashion ahole living in the 1950s.  That is common behavior with the age difference between you two. He's an adult he is perfectly capable of making a meal. Either his is your husband or your child. Tell him to man up.", "NTA. I\u2019m kind of surprised this is the first time this has ever come up in your marriage. But if your husband has been getting his dinners made for him for at least 11 years\u2026 it\u2019s his fucking turn. \n\nI hope your husband has other redeeming qualities, because the side we\u2019re seeing of him here is a deeply sexist man who wants his wife to be his mommy.", "NTA, you made a dinner even though you didn\u2019t want to.

If someone wanted a side dish they could easily take care of that.", "kids need to learn how to plan and prepare meals.", "NTA but in future I would make it explicit that late lunch at a buffet means you won't be cooking dinner. It's normal to only have a small evening meal in that situation, but if the kids aren't used to fending for themselves it's only fair to give a heads up rather than springing it on them when they're hungry. Your husband though? He can get fucked. He's a fully grown adult.he can cook his own pork roast.", "NTA, kinda simple.  Husband has a few issues.  hopefully it's a one off...", "NTA.
