So no way I'm doing everyone else's too. I do my daughter's laundry on a different day, until she's big enough to reach the bottom of the washer without a stool, and then I'll teach her how to do her own. My husband sort of does his own laundry; he has so many clothes that he can go months without washing, but eventually I get sick of all the dirty clothes laying about the master suite and take it all to the laundromat with mine and our daughter's (and the towels, sheets, etc).", "So he works 5 days and she works 7?

Does his mother defer to his father all the time?\n\nMost likely he's a product of his upbringing and continuing on the legacy because this is what he knows.

My husband doesn't bark orders or anything like that but it grates when he asks, 'What were you thinking of having for dinner?'  Fricken nothing or something he hates.  It's like he's a child.\n\nIn your case, I'd be making something you like.. very basic, that's balanced and perhaps meal planning and doing a big cook up to put individual serves into the freezer to be defrosted when you don't want to cook.\n\nAlso a salad sandwich is a complete meal - eggs or meat for the protein plus lots of vegies with some carbs in the bread.", "NTA.
