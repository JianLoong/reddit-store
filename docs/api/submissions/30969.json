I hadn't finished!\" can be said politely and also forcefully. Being polite doesn't mean being a doormat. YTA, I agree with the person who said you need to teach your kids social skills, seems like they both could use some lessons.", "While you are not wrong, your husbands way of handling the situation will do much better in a workplace and friendship situation. Yes, I know your daughter is only 11, so not in the workplace yet. But teaching her good communication skills at a young age is important. \n\nShe does need to be assertive but doing it in a calm voice will feel less aggressive as she moves into more adult situations.", "YTA. Teach her social skills. Being rude when someone has ignored your desire to communicate isn\u2019t the brilliant solution you think it is\u2014it will only alienate people who aren\u2019t stuck at the dinner table with her like her brother.", "YTA - your daughter wasn't being rude, your son was. Both you and your husband need to be on the same page about correcting *your son* for interrupting rather than arguing about your daughter's behavior.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is perfectly capable of still being respectful while asserting herself.  You don\u2019t have to be rude to be heard.", "NAH, I do agree that it\u2019s important to teach kids to set boundaries and stand up for themselves. But I also think it\u2019s maybe wiser to teach them to do so politely first. \u201cExcuse me, I was still talking\u201d will solve the problem most of the time. But if it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m all for teaching a more forceful response.", "YTA. Being rude like that on a regular basis, especially when she's old enough to enter a professional setting, is gonna land your daughter in trouble. She can be direct without being rude.", "I agree with you.  Polite corrections aren't going to work on bull dozers.  You need to put a tree stump in their way, to continue the metaphor.  As she ages, she can add things like \"Remember when I was asked a question and you interrupted me during my first sentence?  You should, it was 6 seconds ago.  STFU and stop doing that!\"\n\nPeople will appreciate her candor and thank her for the correction.  NTA", "You are right. She was being assertive not rude. And being assertive is a VITAL skill, and yet so many girls are  told they mustn't be. \n\nNTA", "Crazy how it's always on the girl, even when it's the boy who did something wrong. YTA.", "NTA\n\nShe has nothing to be sorry about. She WAS talking first. If anything, the son should be the one who is forced to say   sorry. \n\nTell her to stare them straight in the eye as she states she was talking. And if they  keep it up, she should follow up with, \"You are being RUDE!\" \n\nWomen are taught to be sorry for everything, including fully occupying a space. \n\nIt is not wrong for you  to teach your daughter she never needs to be sorry for asserting herself when others are being rude.", "NTA but your husband is right too. She shouldn't apologize in the sentence, she should just say \"I'm still talking, please don't interrupt me\". Because just yelling \"I'm talking !\" will make problems worse.", "YTA, it's a shame you let your son get away with doing that. Is it because he's male? You should be teaching both of them proper etiquette.", "Once the social contract is broken by one side it's not necessary for the other side to uphold it.", "NTA. My shitty ex used to talk over people all the time, me included. I regularly had to firmly interject, \"I'M STILL TALKING.\" or \"She's still talking.\" I wasn't going to ask permission to continue or apologizing to him for him interrupting me. Continuing to talk and stating that you were not done yet when someone starts trying to talk over you is not rude.", "NTA.  If people continually talk over her, she can re-interrupt loudly, quietly, or (IMO) toss things at their heads (because sometimes if you struggle with speech, you're going to struggle with telling people not to interrupt, but generally tossing a rolled up sock or something similar in their direction is fast and easy enough to get their attention to stop speaking so you can finish).  \n\nPeople need to learn to wait their turn in a conversation.  You should also be advocating for her to back up her right to speak.  After your daughter finishes her thought, hold up a hand, turn to your son (or whomever interrupted her) and give them a reminder that it's rude to run over someone who's already speaking.  This needs to be addressed first by parents before conversations happen.  If her brother (or anyone else) continues doing this after being corrected, get ready to advocate every single time.", "NTA and it's great that you're teaching your daughter to advocate for herself. But in her own family she shouldn't have to. Who is teaching your son not to interrupt girls and women?", "NTA.  Sometimes, unfortunately, the only way to break out of the stutter is the shout", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s correcting her, I see it as giving her permission to be assertive.", "It's kinda nuts that no one sees this as her correcting the son. She literally cuts him off for the daughter, and explains how to deal with his poor behavior right in front of him.", "I\u2019ve never had a single man respond to a calm voice. It has always taken a stern \u201cI\u2019m talking.\u201d along with intensely staring into the persons eyes to get them to STFU.", "I agree here. There is a time and place for pulling out the big guns. But answering rudeness with rudeness can escalate situations which a little patience and grace could diffuse. Being polite doesn't mean being a pushover. I just means you don't let yourself respond to negative behavior with more of the same.\n\nThat said, there are times when a well placed rude put down will be far more effective than being nice.", "How does continuing to talk when someone interrupts you make you rude?", "Yes, and no mention of correcting and stopping the son from being rude. Welcome to years of kids yelling at each other.", "You\u2019re also telling your son it\u2019s OK to act like that and that it\u2019s fine to be rude as long as no one pushes back on it.", "You need to do both! Your son is being rude af. Your daughter should stand up for herself but you need to get on him for being rude", "I agree that young girls need to be taught to stand up for themselves, but you do need to address your sons behavior directly with him as well", "*But you didn't correct your son's bad behavior.*", "YTA- you corrected the wrong person. Correct your son for being rude!", "I do not believe that a 14 year old boy is going to perceive any of this as directed at him, especially one who thinks it\u2019s fine to interrupt and talk over others. I doubt he is socially sensitive enough to make that connection. He needs to be directly told that his behavior isn\u2019t acceptable and how he should be acting instead.", "Then you are around the wrong men. I have had many men respond to calm voices. In fact, I have seen men respond to calm voices but go nuts when yelled at.", "Well if you do it rudely, it's rude. Being rude to people who are rude to you just means you're all boors. People with tact and class can be polite to those who are rude to them without being doormats.", "Honestly OP should be doing both. It sucks, but their daughter is going to be dealing with this issue for the rest of her life. It does her a disservice to not prepare her for that. That being said, OP does need to make sure that their son is aware that talking over his sister is inappropriate and will not be tolerated.", "I didn\u2019t see it as correcting as much as teaching her daughter what to do in situations like this.", "I agree. But I don\u2019t think \u201cjust be rude if he\u2019s rude\u201d is a good lesson either. \u201cExcuse me, I was speaking. As I was saying\u2026\u201d is pretty effective too (speaking from experience here!), and gets your point across without being rude. Unfortunately, women *do* get penalized more harshly for being rude, especially in the workplace, and as unfair as it is, it\u2019s still something that girls and women need to be aware of.", "She should\u2019ve corrected her son and not used it as a stupid teaching moment for her kid!", "I agree. And the small verbiage change is important here. Not \"Sorry\" - \"excuse me\". It gives calmness while asserting control of the conversation.", "Why not both? Correcting the son\u2019s rudeness and teaching the daughter to stand up for herself aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. And the latter helps the *daughter* a lot more in the long run."]}
