She can be direct without being rude.", "I agree with you.  Polite corrections aren't going to work on bull dozers.  You need to put a tree stump in their way, to continue the metaphor.  As she ages, she can add things like \"Remember when I was asked a question and you interrupted me during my first sentence?  You should, it was 6 seconds ago.  STFU and stop doing that!\"\n\nPeople will appreciate her candor and thank her for the correction.  NTA", "You are right. She was being assertive not rude.

Continuing to talk and stating that you were not done yet when someone starts trying to talk over you is not rude.", "NTA.  If people continually talk over her, she can re-interrupt loudly, quietly, or (IMO) toss things at their heads (because sometimes if you struggle with speech, you're going to struggle with telling people not to interrupt, but generally tossing a rolled up sock or something similar in their direction is fast and easy enough to get their attention to stop speaking so you can finish).  \n\nPeople need to learn to wait their turn in a conversation.  You should also be advocating for her to back up her right to speak.  After your daughter finishes her thought, hold up a hand, turn to your son (or whomever interrupted her) and give them a reminder that it's rude to run over someone who's already speaking.  This needs to be addressed first by parents before conversations happen.  If her brother (or anyone else) continues doing this after being corrected, get ready to advocate every single time.", "NTA and it's great that you're teaching your daughter to advocate for herself.

It's like verbal chicken, and it works.\n* Or, let them talk.  Then let a few seconds of silence pass, then, calmly say \"are you finished?  Because you keep interrupting when I talk, and I want to make sure you're done speaking and willing to listen before I start again.\"\n\nEither way, advising your children to enter a rudeness arms race when they experience it in life is bad advice.", "NTA. Good on you, you don't need to apologize when someone is rude to you.", "YTA. I agree with your premise - that we need to teach girls to be more assertive - but not your actual strategy. In most situations, if your goal is for someone to *listen*, it's in your interest to remain somewhat polite.

I agree with you and you're doing the right thing by teaching her how to stand up for herself.", "For the daughter - I always tell my kids to interject back, but to be polite, you don't have to stoop down to someone else's level by being rude also. Not everyone does it to be dismissive. I know people who have ADHD or other hyperactive brains, and they don't mean to talk over people. They just get excited. Once you correct the behavior, they usually don't do it again. Otherwise, if they continue to do it, then be as rude as you'd like back. I would agree with your husband. \n\nFor the son - he needs to be put in his place for talking over people like he is more important.

I thought so and so had finished talking/I got excited and blurted out and then they really rudely shouted \"I'm talking\" and now my feelings are hurt/they seem like an asshole. \n\nI think your husband is probably right for the first response.

If he feels that strongly about it, he can stop interrupting people and wait his turn to speak. Problem solved.", "NAH. I understand what your husband is going for.

At work or in school, she should probably try the calm and rational approach, but at the family dinner table  with her own 14-year-old brother, who is quite frankly doing it deliberately having been being told not to she\u2019s quite free to respond in kind and talk right over him. She simply doesn\u2019t owe other assholes her being gentle and conciliatory and uncomplaining in response. \n\nRedditors will have you believe it\u2019s cut and dried and the same answer is always correct but life isn\u2019t like that, most things are shades of grey and and circumstances alter cases.", "I\u2019m talking is a good first step. I suggest that you suggest other ways to build up to it.  If she doesn\u2019t know how to use I am talking in an assertive but diplomatic way she can try \u201cyou keep interrupting me\u201d. Focusing the attention of the wrongdoing on the person who keeps interrupting. This way regardless of what tone she uses she will be justified. \u201cI\u2019ve  not yet finished my point\u201d is a good one, it emphasizes the fact that they have interrupted you before you have managed to  verbalize a coherent thought. If she doesn\u2019t mind saying something before a bit longer \u201cI listened while you spoke, allow me to finish sharing my thoughts.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with saying I\u2019m talking in whatever tone to someone who rudely interrupt you.

I'm sure you're dealing with your sons constant speaking over his sister and that's not what you asked.", "This type of thing is very common in the world around us today. Men tend to talk over women a lot. I am finding myself having to say to men I was not finished yet. It is really annoying to be talked over. Saying I'm sorry is apologizing for stopping them from interrupting you. That's not okay. There is nothing for this 11-year-old to be sorry for. At most excuse me, I was still talking is a good start. However, if they don't pay attention the excuse me has to go. Men are not polite to women when they talk over us why should we be polite to them for correcting their behavior?", "NTA Your daughter shouldn't apologize for not letting herself be interrupted. She is not the one who should be apologizing. \"Excuse me, I wasn't finished\" works as a more polite option, but under no circumstances should your daughter be apologizing for someone else speaking over her.", "YTA - a little politeness, with appropriate firmness, goes a long way. Teach your daughter to be firm but gracious and she will find that she gains the respect of others. Teaching her to treat others as they treat her is just tacky.", "Men typically do this to women - it moves into the workplace and is a terrible behavior and disrupts many team meetings.\n\nI gotta say I am with you on this one.

I'm just thinking that firstly she might find the shift to asserting herself easier if she feels it's a more 'polite but firm' response. She might also be wary of 'escalating' into an argument.\n\n\n She isn't the one being rude so she shouldn't have to worry but I remember being a quiet, anxious kid and wouldn't have dared to call someone out so boldly, even with encouragement.

I agree with you in concept, but I think the best solution is somewhere in the middle. It\u2019s good to be assertive, but it\u2019s better to be assertive and still keep it classy and be the bigger person. Not necessarily because the person who interrupted her deserves politeness, but because it makes her look better. More mature, more respectable, more capable handling problems in a calm and professional manner. Not everyone who interrupts her is going to be her 14yo brother at family dinner. \n\nI agree \u201csorry\u201d is the wrong word. She shouldn\u2019t be the one apologizing to the person who interrupted her. Girls/women are already socialized to apologize too much. I think a firm, slightly louder but not shouting \u201cExcuse me, I was talking\u201d or \u201cExcuse me, I wasn\u2019t finished\u201d is the way to go. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re saying she\u2019s shy or if she just has a quiet voice, but as a former shy, quiet child, speaking up might be a little easier for her if she knows she\u2019s *not* being rude. Shy kids don\u2019t like unnecessary attention. If she feels like she has to be too bold or aggressive about it, she might be less likely to do it at all because she\u2019s worried about people\u2019s reactions.
