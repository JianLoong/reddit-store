We decided to sell our homes and buy one home together and we finally found our dream home and it has 4 bedrooms. One master bedroom, one bedroom with an en suit and two smaller bedrooms. The master room is obviously for me and Jack and the smallest room will be his office. The issue is the other two bedrooms.\n\nGrowing up in our home the biggest room was always for the oldest child so I assumed Ethan would have the room with en suit and the other one will be for Lu.\n\nEthan loved the room. A few days ago I was talking to Jack and told him how excited Ethan is about having a bigger room and his own en suit, he looked at me confused and said that room is for Lu not Ethan. I told him that it's not fair because Ethan is older so he should get the bigger room and once he left for college Lu can get that room. He said that's not gonna happen because Lu always had an en suit and she is used to having it and she shouldn't lose this. I was getting angry at this point and told him she can survive from walking a few steps to go to the bathroom and he sarcastically told me that Ethan can survive it too and Ethan's last bedroom was way smaller than this so it will actually be an upgrade for him while for Lu it'll be a downgrade. I told him it's not fair that just because my son didn't have a big bedroom before he can never get one.\n\nTo make the matter worse I was talking about buying new furniture for Ethan's room since his furniture is too old and asked him if he could help me a bit and he told me he is planning to buy new furniture for Lu too because this whole situation is \"very difficult for her and he wants to make her feel better\" he offered that he could buy new things for Lu and Ethan can use Lu's old things. I blew up at him and asked him if that's how much he cares about my son? He gets the smaller room and the old furniture while his daughter gets the bigger room and new furniture? He thinks I'm an asshole for \"expecting his daughter to suffer for my son\" but I don't think that is \"suffering\". The bedroom is nice and she'll only have to be there for 2 years and the furniture are new and good enough.

She also sold her home?", "Does she not realize how expensive guitars can be\u2026.? For all we know the guitar was the same price or could even have been more if he also bought accessories and stuff for it. I know almost nothing about guitars but I do know hey can be pricey.", "Not only that, but she bought the daughter a dress because \u201cthat\u2019s all she could afford\u201d but won\u2019t comment what she got her son and if it\u2019s equal to the dress. She expects to spend the majority of her income on her son and her bf to divide things equally.", "Oh yeah, no arguments at all from me on that. It doesn't help with finding out how much he paid for the house compared to her. I can't blame her to ask for some help on the furniture, but to then demand that her son get the bigger room because of age is no better than him bring it up because of her sex.", "I thought I read in a comment that wasn\u2019t an option for her", "Based on the replies, it looks like their debt is bad enough that they can't afford a studio.", "Yeah, no. He needs an office ergo his house did not have enough bedrooms.\n\n\nHe's the one doing her a massive favour given everything that's come out about her debt.", "How is he going to see her in the bathroom? In your country do you not have doors on your rooms? Do you shower and trek through the house in the nude?", "Having an open family can be helpful. By that I mean one that talks about bodily functions like sex, periods, etc openly and doesn't shame them. Will definitely make the whole thing less awkward. \n\nBut yeah, teenagers in general have a tough time in that stage of their lives.", "The way I see it, this is an issue people with money for en-suite bathrooms have. I'll never understand it, my childhood home has one, my apartment has one. So I try to judge based on if it was the norm for me.", "Well, lots of sexual assaults happened in larger families.", "> why did you purposefully leave out so much information in your post?\n\nIt\u2019s easier to play the victim", "Maybe you should read them then.", "If it\u2019s only two years until your son moves out then surely it makes more sense to let the daughter move into the bigger room so she  doesn\u2019t have to move her stuff again in two years time. \n\nYou definitely should have discussed this as adults first though instead of buying a house and making assumptions.", "Financial problems and expecting everything in the process. YTA.", "Great planning.", "Wow you couldn\u2019t figure this Out before you moved in together? Your poor son.", "I mean, that\u2019s a little concerning. Seems like this is a lot bigger than who gets the better bedroom. Also considering the furniture debate, I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve talked about and are in agreement about other bigger costs coming up. Cars, university, weddings, etc. if these are things you\u2019re funding, you don\u2019t want to wait until it comes up to find out that they\u2019re once again being treated differently. \n\nNot judging you, honestly, . But I do think it\u2019s worth it to seriously consider how much you\u2019d be willing to overlook because you feel like you don\u2019t have any other options. Best of luck to you and your son OP, hope you manage to figure it out", "Why wouldn\u2019t your parents let you move in with them?", "They're saying OP should stop making demands on other people's money, she was going to be homeless and she's being offered a house where she and her son can live comfortably and yet she demands better accommodations for her son and new furniture all paid by the bf for no other reasons than \"he can afford it\".", "Marriage is not a magic switch where you suddenly have to care about your SO's children, and it's not normal to neglect them before you sign your wedding contract. What are you so hung up on the marriage thing, when you didn't even bother to remember the genders of the respective kids ? \n\nMoving in together is a way bigger step than signing a paper, and it requires compromise, they are not just housemates.", "Yes, but it sounds like one child needs new furniture and the other just wants it. Buying one kid luxuries while the other doesn\u2019t have the basics is going to breed resentment.", "There's comments about her debt situation that they're referring to. Apparently the house wasn't paid for equally and she had previous debt that is affecting her", "Which she was forced to sell to pay off debt and OP made a comment that the most she can afford now is a studio apartment. Her own parents refused to let her move in with them.", "They can definitely be just as expensive (or more!) than a laptop. I have friends who have guitars that are thousandssss of dollars.", "I don\u2019t think the boyfriend made that argument (maybe I missed it) - all I saw was that she\u2019s used to having an ensuite. \n\nI see see a fair number of comments about it though.", "Move along.", "We lived in the US but were dirt poor. 1 bathroom for a 7-person, multigenerational household. Not at all an open family. Didn\u2019t even have my own room. Being a teenager sucked but you learn to live, and not everyone can afford to have a room for each person and a damn office. I\u2019m blown away by some of the entitlement and privilege I see in these kinds of discussions.", "They sold their existing houses to buy the new house.", "He doesn't treat him badly. Apparently he is generous but op's problem is that he gives his own kid more than op's kid. They aren't married or even lived together before, ofc he is giving more to his own kid. Thry only moved in together so op wouldn't become homeless or unable to provide any room for her son. Op's comments show that she is in a bad financial situation and is basically expecting her bf to fix it for her while she whines about the daughter.", "She sold it to buy this house with him.", "I thought it sounded like she sold that", "Yep, the eternal victim.", "You don\u2019t get to tell someone to treat their own daughter the same as a kid they\u2019ve known for six years just because you\u2019re moving in together.", "Because she has a father who is responsible for buying her shit, not some random dude.", "It\u2019s called life. Blame your parents not some stranger.", "Ah I see", "They can also be 100. Unless you are a hard core musician or money to burn you aren't spending thousands on a guitar. I have 4 and the most expensive was 1000.", "I don't think he did either. That was mainly the other commenters on here I was talking about. I believe you're right that he brought up her getting a smaller room, and she used to have a in suite, which are fair reasons in themselve on why she should get it. Either way, for them, it's a downgrade while for her and her son, it's an upgrade, and finding that out alone changes the dynamics.", "From what?", "Why is the brother going to see her in a towel?

You could easily argue that he is a bad boyfriend because he's invalidating OP's feelings. \n\nJust because you have a different opinion, doesn't mean that you're ignoring the other person's feelings. \n\nEspecially when there isn't a clear compromise to be made beyond neither of them getting the en-sutie - but that apparently isn't an option either of them are considering. \n\nThe other way is to give one of them the master, which just opens up other issues where one of them is still getting the \"better\" bedroom.\n\nPersonally, I feel that an en-suite should be for a guest room - that way you're not getting bathroom smells into your bedroom, and guests have their own bathroom for when they stay.\n\nIt's big enough that he can double it as his home office for 99% of the time, and having the en-suite there is handy too.\n\nPersonally, with all else being equal, I'd probably give the en-suite to the girl.\n\nBut maybe she would prefer having regular, unshared, access to a bath - a non-master ensuite usually only has a shower in my experience.\n\nThis is something which generally requires discussion between all parties and not just assumptions.\n\nAnd should have been discussed before buying a new house.", "I\u2019d live in a cardboard box before I\u2019d ever let someone treat my kid like that", "Yeah, I'm picturing the AITA from the guy's perspective. \"I am a single father with a 14 year old daughter.

Most families towel it up.", "I have never had this problem and my bathroom was the furthest from my room and on the ground floor. Is this a common problem for other girls?  TIL I guess", "I don\u2019t think the furniture thing makes him an AH. Her kid is her responsibility. He shouldn\u2019t have to buy her kid furniture.

Maybe you find it too much of a hassle to dress and then undress but for me it would beat being almost naked in front of other people", "I know. I never realised how much I suffered in 46years never having had an en suite bathroom. It was always 1; bathroom between 5 (2 girls plus 1 boy plus parents). We managed.", "I\u2019m confused on how they picked this house without ever discussing who would end up where.

It happens.  Don't be so judgemental about other people's periods.  You don't live in their bodies.  Not every heavy flow is the same and some people have medical issues.", "Well, imagine then being the daughter of the bread winner and your dad just sold your childhood home, where you had a big room with your own bathroom, to help our his girlfriend with her debt, buys a new house for them so that they won't be homeless (OP said he paid 85%) and the gf still demands that his kid gets the best room and new furniture to top that, while you get stuck with the small room, does that sound fair?\n\nIn this scenario I think it would have probably been more traumatic for OP's kid to be left homeless due to his mom's debt instead of managing for two years with a room that's similar to the one he already had.", "How about the fact that he paid for the majority of the house and the only reason he is moving is because OP had to sell her house and would be homeless is he didn't buy a house and force his daughter to move?", "My phrasing was off apparently.

She paid 15% for the new place and bf paid 85%. The daughter is upset she had to move because of OP and hates her now.\n\nSucks for the son but I think the daughter should get the ensuite since it isn't fair for her to have to downgrade because of OP's problems. But the son should get the new furniture since the daughter has furniture in good condition and it's a bit much for her to get the best room and new furniture while he gets hand me downs (ups because he's older?) and the crappier room", "I don't like putting clothes on while damp and a towel takes care of covering any sensitive bits but would not diminish awkwardness", "Exactly this! Does OP really mean they toured this house and didn't discuss \"this room will be X, this room will be Y, we could put the couch along this wall?\" Like seriously, I'm getting ready to start looking for another (hopefully our last) rental house and even just looking at pictures and floor plans online at this stage, my husband and I are already having this discussion.", "I have a heavy flow and medical issues, thanks for the assumption I have no idea what I'm talking about though \u270c Dripping on the floor in the bathroom is much more common than anywhere else, and you clean it up, because again, we aren't animals. It's kind of unrealistic to think that someone with a heavy flow (which again you're assuming about OPs stepdaughter) is just entitled to their own bathroom. What's she going to do in a dorm? Demand her own en suite?\n\nPlot twist, none of this matters anyway because OPs stepdaughter is Trans, or has a condition that gives her very light periods, or none at all.
