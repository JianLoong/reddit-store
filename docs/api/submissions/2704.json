He has a 14 years old daughter that we'll call Lu and I have a 16 years old son that we'll call Ethan.\n\nI have a 1 bedroom home with a basement that I turned into a bedroom for Ethan so we couldn't move in our home and while Jack has a 3 bedroom home he said he needed one of the rooms as an office since he WFH so we had to find another home. We decided to sell our homes and buy one home together and we finally found our dream home and it has 4 bedrooms. One master bedroom, one bedroom with an en suit and two smaller bedrooms. The master room is obviously for me and Jack and the smallest room will be his office. The issue is the other two bedrooms.\n\nGrowing up in our home the biggest room was always for the oldest child so I assumed Ethan would have the room with en suit and the other one will be for Lu.\n\nEthan loved the room. A few days ago I was talking to Jack and told him how excited Ethan is about having a bigger room and his own en suit, he looked at me confused and said that room is for Lu not Ethan. I told him that it's not fair because Ethan is older so he should get the bigger room and once he left for college Lu can get that room. He said that's not gonna happen because Lu always had an en suit and she is used to having it and she shouldn't lose this. I was getting angry at this point and told him she can survive from walking a few steps to go to the bathroom and he sarcastically told me that Ethan can survive it too and Ethan's last bedroom was way smaller than this so it will actually be an upgrade for him while for Lu it'll be a downgrade. I told him it's not fair that just because my son didn't have a big bedroom before he can never get one.\n\nTo make the matter worse I was talking about buying new furniture for Ethan's room since his furniture is too old and asked him if he could help me a bit and he told me he is planning to buy new furniture for Lu too because this whole situation is \"very difficult for her and he wants to make her feel better\" he offered that he could buy new things for Lu and Ethan can use Lu's old things. I blew up at him and asked him if that's how much he cares about my son? He gets the smaller room and the old furniture while his daughter gets the bigger room and new furniture? He thinks I'm an asshole for \"expecting his daughter to suffer for my son\" but I don't think that is \"suffering\". The bedroom is nice and she'll only have to be there for 2 years and the furniture are new and good enough.

Caring for your son and paying for him are two entirely different things.", "Well if he isn\u2019t your meal ticket, I\u2019m kind of curious what\u2019s going on with buying a house together, where he pays for most of it, just when you develop \u201cfinancial issues.\u201d Where do these come from?", "Maybe he should care about your 16 year old son but not as much as his own daughter. So you're forcing her to move out of her ensuite bedroom to help you out and think she should further suffer?", "Great. So he can use her old ones.\nIf you weren't in a relationship how would you get him new furniture?", "The condition of hers has no bearing on her father wanting to get her new things. You said that he was doing it because it's (and I'm paraphrasing) traumatizing and invasive to make this frankly extreme change. He isn't making Ethan sleep on the floor to get her new stuff. \n\nHonestly, beggars can't be choosers.", "Why didn\u2019t you get a home equity loan and keep the house?", "You are mooching and want the biggest room for your son and want you husband to buy him new furniture on top of it?", "My bad, but that still makes her a gold digger", "I thought that was normal too since otherwise your family would see you", "I've never done that. Doing a full moisturizing/skincare routine would take up the bathroom for way too long for the needs of a family of 6. That would have been rude in my house growing up.", "All of my years growing up with family this is what I did and what my family members did as well. I don't think it's weird or inconvenient. When I've had an ensuite I have done it differently but it's not like one way is SO much more difficult than the other. I also had a college dorm with communal showers down the hall. I survived that just fine too.", "And she feels the same about his daughter. They are both toxic", "why is no one seeing the OP doesn\u2019t like his daughter either", "Because he's putting his own child before her child?", "I doubt that. Last Christmas he bought a guitar for the son. But OP was salty that he gifted his daughter something even more expensive.", "His daughter is forced to move so her daddy can help his girlfriend pay off her personal debt. So with your sexist logic, the poor girl needs to suffer more. Wow", "His daughter was forced to move, had to see her childhood home being sold just because OP was in debt and her dad was gracious. That girl deserves that room and new furniture. She already suffered enough to get OP to be debtfree.", "Absolutely. They both went in this project without communication.", "Eh I don't have an en suite bedroom for my whole 22 years of life and neither do 98% of the women around me. We survive. I keep a small stack of pads in my room and I never was dripping blood om the floor with my pretty heavy periods because my pants hold it back. Gender shouldn't play a role in this... Sorry, this feels entitled. I live in Europe and en suite bathrooms are an exception... No one feels bad about it. It is a luxury\n\nEdit: plus the son is moving out in two years likely anyways, so the daughter can have that room. Men deserve bathrooms too and there are plenty of men who spend more time in the bathroom than women. \n\nEdit 2: oh boy, the debt situation and the financial situation makes it difficult. I still stand by my point that things basing off gender shouldn't be a thing and that having a uterus shouldn't get you automatically a private bathroom", ">Although, while this furniture thing is a complete assholery,\n\nIs it though? He wants to buy his daughter new furniture. She wants to buy her son new furniture. She is asking him to contribute to her son's things, but I don't see her offering to do the same for his daughter. He is offering a compromise - Ethan gets some older furniture and she can buy the rest, while she expect him to start sharing his money before they've even moved in together.\n\nBoth of them are doing the exact same thing, he just happens to have a bit more money than her, for whatever reason. That doesn't make him an asshole.\n\nBtw, both kids could have a large room with a bathroom. It'd just require the two adults to make some sacrifices and *they* can move into a new room when Ethan leaves for college.", "From someone with an extremely heavy flow, I have never just walked around \"dripping blood on the floor\" like I was raised by fucking wolves. Where are you getting this narrative?", "I don\u2019t need to imagine what that\u2019s like, and I still think the son should get the en suite. I also don\u2019t need to imagine being the step kid of the breadwinner and being treated much differently (worse) than my stepsister, that was much more traumatizing than bleeding on the floor on my way to my shared bathroom down the hall.", "This. If I had a daughter and son both and can\u2019t give both large rooms, I\u2019d give the larger one with a bathroom to my girl. It\u2019s not favoritism, guys objectively need less time in the bathroom.", "That's rubbish. No they don't.  A wash bag with your stuff in, a dressing gown and slippers,      \n\nIf you are referring to having periods, it natural, a closed bathroom bin with pad or tampon bags, absolutely fine.", "So weird how OP didn't mention this little tidbit in the main post.", "Bad credit probably", "The son\u2019s in the exact same position. It\u2019s not a reason to spoil the girl - sometimes tough choices need making by adults and the parents in this situation both failed hard; but treating the kids unequally over it is much more of a fail in the long run.", "The mother\u2019s made everyone else suffer over this; but shit happens and the son\u2019s in exactly the same position. Neither of the kids in this situation deserves to suffer more than the other. OP and her partner are both refusing to take responsibility but if they want to be a family and make this work for the next two years, teaching the daughter that if she pouts and cries over it she will get a better deal will teach her bad values and bad behaviour.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about whether the daughter\u2019s suffering or not - I\u2019m sure she\u2019s genuinely upset; but so is the son, who is in the exact same situation of having to move when he doesn\u2019t want to because his parent made bad decisions.\n\nIf leaving her childhood home and feeling homesick for it is the real problem then it won\u2019t be solved by being set up above the other child in the household, and she needs less material and more emotional support, and both parents here are showing bad values by treating this as something that can be compensated for in that way. Throwing money at her without offering her any more healthy coping mechanisms or mental and emotional tools to deal with adversity really doesn\u2019t do much for her personal development; and offering her the appropriate tools ought to make having such a sharp difference in treatment between the two kids unnecessary.\n\nHer dad is taking on his partner\u2019s financial responsibilities. He\u2019s *chosen* (rightly or wrongly) to do that, and one of those responsibilities is looking after his partner\u2019s kid and treating him as family. To then turn round and go \u201cnope, sorry, my kid needs all the best of everything and you\u2019re only here because I like fucking your mom\u201d, which is the clear message to OP\u2019s son here, and to set no expectation on his daughter to show the same compassion as he did, or to take enough responsibility to explain to her that the reason she\u2019s suffering is because *he* chose to combine finances with his partner (rather than just letting her blame OP) is being a terrible role model to both kids and a bad parent.", "I just pointed out that I am a female (37) and have never had an ensuite, I live in one of the Europe's poorest countries and I've never even seen an ensuite. But yes, I have dripped blood through panties and pajamas in my teen years and it was super awkward as I've never seen it coming, just got out of bad and started for the toilet.", "See my comment above. In my teen years I got up from my bed and got a period and literally started dripping blood through panties and pajamas. I was mortified and also scared AF, luckily it never happened again (due to me learning to always wear some kind of pads prior to my period) but if I had an ensuite it would have been the best thing ever. I don't remember if I've had pads in my room at that moment, but even if I had, I don't think I would have had enough brain power to remember to use them, I just ran to the bathroom.", "No. They oldest one gets the bathroom, that\u2019s a sexist thought", "Thats because she was hoping for votes to be in her favour. She was probably planning on showing this thread to her boyfriend so it would change his mind.", "You paid 15%, you and your son are living in HIS house. Wake up!", "I would like to add to this and say that I am also a female (20) student, currently living in a dorm with mixed bathrooms on the hallway (no en-suite for the rooms or whatever they are called in a dorm, only the mixed ones on the hallway). And back when I was living home we only had one bathroom in the apartment that I had to share with my mom, my dad and my little brother. It's not the end of the world.", "Oh yeah, I remember bleeding through pants as well, so I got an extra matrass protector. Life safer! Sucks when you get it at night! But ehm those are more the exceptions tbh. It is not like you leave a whole bloody path all over the floor and you need a bathroom next to your room to avoid that. Idk what the logic here is tbh. Is it more convenient because you don't have to walk around in bloody pants? Yes. Does it make you entitled to a bigger bedroom etc? No.\n\nEdit: I hope your problems are fixed by now btw! I gained the talent to feel when periods are coming and I even wake up when it is coming. I see it as a blessing after years of problems haha", "Okay, you're making a gigantic leap from \"this happened to me one time\" to \"this is something a strangers child on reddit deals with on a monthly basis and that's a FACT, she should have an en suite\". Everyone isn't you. This is like me saying that my brother used to get nosebleeds during the night and got blood on the floor so obviously OPs son needs the en suite because I assume he's also having cold weather nosebleeds and he should have easy access to a bathroom.", "Why? What's the merit of being born before that allows for the best room? Why does the oldest need the room with the bathroom more than the youngest? That's an ageist thought.", "This! Yes. 100% agree with it.", "Sorry, but what are you people talking about? She *needs* a bathroom attached to her room to be \u201csafe\u201d? Don\u2019t regular bathrooms that are not attached to bedrooms not have doors that you can close and lock just perfectly fine?\n\nYou realize that bathrooms attached to bedrooms is not a thing for probably 99% of the world population; that does not make them any less \u201csafe\u201d."]}
