We both have children from our previous relationships. He has a 14 years old daughter that we'll call Lu and I have a 16 years old son that we'll call Ethan.\n\nI have a 1 bedroom home with a basement that I turned into a bedroom for Ethan so we couldn't move in our home and while Jack has a 3 bedroom home he said he needed one of the rooms as an office since he WFH so we had to find another home. We decided to sell our homes and buy one home together and we finally found our dream home and it has 4 bedrooms. One master bedroom, one bedroom with an en suit and two smaller bedrooms. The master room is obviously for me and Jack and the smallest room will be his office. The issue is the other two bedrooms.\n\nGrowing up in our home the biggest room was always for the oldest child so I assumed Ethan would have the room with en suit and the other one will be for Lu.\n\nEthan loved the room. A few days ago I was talking to Jack and told him how excited Ethan is about having a bigger room and his own en suit, he looked at me confused and said that room is for Lu not Ethan. I told him that it's not fair because Ethan is older so he should get the bigger room and once he left for college Lu can get that room. He said that's not gonna happen because Lu always had an en suit and she is used to having it and she shouldn't lose this. I was getting angry at this point and told him she can survive from walking a few steps to go to the bathroom and he sarcastically told me that Ethan can survive it too and Ethan's last bedroom was way smaller than this so it will actually be an upgrade for him while for Lu it'll be a downgrade. I told him it's not fair that just because my son didn't have a big bedroom before he can never get one.\n\nTo make the matter worse I was talking about buying new furniture for Ethan's room since his furniture is too old and asked him if he could help me a bit and he told me he is planning to buy new furniture for Lu too because this whole situation is \"very difficult for her and he wants to make her feel better\" he offered that he could buy new things for Lu and Ethan can use Lu's old things. I blew up at him and asked him if that's how much he cares about my son? He gets the smaller room and the old furniture while his daughter gets the bigger room and new furniture? He thinks I'm an asshole for \"expecting his daughter to suffer for my son\" but I don't think that is \"suffering\". The bedroom is nice and she'll only have to be there for 2 years and the furniture are new and good enough.

Both of you. How you bought a whole entire house without discussing this exact issue first, I'll never know.\n\nAnd I'm really pretty disgusted by your lack of empathy for Lu.
