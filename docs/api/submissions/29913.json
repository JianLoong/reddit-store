He is violating your privacy and gaslighting you. This is the perfect example of gaslighting; he deleted it then told you that you must have done it accidentally, he wanted you to believe his version of reality, when he knew that he was lying and this was not the actual reality, leading you to doubt your own actions and memories.\n\nSomeone who will gaslight you so openly is manipulative and selfish, and this isn't going to be the only time this crops up. He doesn't want you to be \"negative\", when your negativity is just recalling facts and feelings - the truth. He wants to be able to tell you that you didn't say something or do something, and you have no evidence to back it up, so you doubt yourself again. He's trying to manipulate you completely into his narrative. I wonder how often he does this with real conversations where you only have your memory as evidence, and then he claims your memories are wrong.\n\nAnd him claiming he \"has no idea\" why you're upset is another attempt to make you think you're crazy and he's right. He absolutely knows why you're upset, and if the tables were turned and you were going through his phone, deleting his things and then lying to him about it, I'm pretty sure he'd be upset too.\n\nYou can't trust him. You can't trust him not to go through your things, not to violate your privacy, not to lie to you, not to make you think you're the one in the wrong when he 100% is.  I doubt this is the only giant red flag and if you dig deeper you'll see a lot of problematic things.", "NTA. Forget the notes for a sec:\n\n\u2022 He is deleting things from your phone without permission (violation of trust)\n\n\u2022 He also decides what you have access to (violation of autonomy).\n\nAlso, you need notes because:\n\n\n\u2022 He disregards what happens or acts like it didn't (gaslighting)\n\n\u2022 You feel crazy (gaslighting)\n\nI think you should leave.", "NTA\n\nThere are some big red flags here, not only is he going through your phone and deleting stuff he has lied about doing it.\n\nYou need to dump him he is a controlling AH", "NTA and this is a massive red flag. I've been married to my husband for 10 years and he has never gotten into my phone without my express permission. This man has no respect for your boundaries or your privacy, then lies to you and gaslights you when you catch him out. This is absolutely not okay and, for me, would be a deal breaker.", "NTA. Your bf is the TA. He willingly crosses privacy boundaries AND lies about doing so EVEN when caught. Red flags everywhere\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nIt's not about you \"being negative\" and more about him repeatedly misbehaving. He dismisses your feelings AND may even be a bit crazy believing that deleting these notes and chats will erase them from your mind? Wtf. \n\nThe audacity! Toss him or at least give him the s*.", "NTA\n\nNo one, absolutely no one has the right to delete your notes, thoughts, records and history. \n\nNo one had the right to determine what is good for you unless you need serious medical intervention and even that has guidelines enshrined within the legal system (the mental health act).\n\nThis is pure arrogance and driven by his desire to control the narrative. \n\nYou really need to think about this carefully. Unquestionably he lies, he also invades your privacy for personal gain, his behaviour is so questionable that you picked up this habit in the first place.  The foundation of your relationship is indeed negative and very probably affecting your mental health, him deleting the evidence is ineffective in combating that and probably contributing. Leaving the relationship is probably much more effective. \n\nYou are young and have no reason to believe this complete stranger, but I can only advise you to consider investing your time in people that are of significantly better character.", "Nta. He's deleting things so he can gaslight you op. Which is really messed up. It's also messed to feel the need to keep notes that you did for the reason you did. Meaning that's not normal or healthy in a relationship. You should NOT feel like you need to do that. \n\nHe is removing your receipts so you can't challenge him when he lies to you, clearly even though he is a liar he can make you doubt your sanity, and question your own memory.\n\nMy advice op, is to leave now. Don't talk to him about it before hand if you do. He's just going to manipulate you with false promises and lies and drag this out even longer. His behavior is incredibly controlling.", "Leave this guy now, he is toxic and untrustworthy. He has already shown you who he is. It doesnt matter his reasoning. What you need to see is that he has very low accountability for his actions to the point that he is willing to make you feel crazy and joke about it being your fault. This is a very dangerous sign for you to ignore. He is also telling you he knows whats best for is that you not think of him being less than perfect. Nothing else to add except you deserve better.", "NTA.\n\nNobody has the right to invade your privacy, even if it's a boyfriend or a spouse. His actions just show that:\n\n1. He has no respect for you or your boundaries\n2. He wants to wipe out all evidence that he treats you badly\n\nA good partner will be taking note of and **working on these problems** instead of wiping them out so they're out of sight and out of mind.\n\nI would also recommend checking out what the term gaslighting means, because I suspect that's what he is trying to do with you.", "NTA. Already him accessing your phone without you knowing is really creepy. Would he be okay with you doing random things on his phone? Is he controlling also in other ways?\n\nEdit: him lying about it is also a red flag, he's been trying to gaslight you.", "NTA, and get out now\u2014seriously. This is not normal behavior in a relationship. Your partner is extremely controlling, dishonest, and is invading your privacy. This is unacceptable. Please get out, because this behavior will likely escalate.", "You\u2019re going to feel crazy because he wants you to, that\u2019s whole purpose of the manipulation and gas lighting techniques he\u2019s using. You will begin doubting yourself eventually and trust him only and then you will be his puppet. You\u2019re well on your way, unless you leave. Someone like that isn\u2019t going to change and you deserve better than to be in a relationship with a liar. Your whole relationship is a lie and the longer you drag it out the more healing you will need to do. Get out now while you\u2019re still able to bounce back completely. Op, NTA, yet, he will make you look like TAH if you stay tho.", "NTA but you are missing the forest for the trees. He is an unrepentant liar and manipulator and this pervades the whole relationship and always will. That is the real issue. You can't build a good life with someone like that.", "OP, you're 20. You're not married and you don't have kids who might affected. I couldn't even read this whole thing it's so ridiculous. Just run. Fast and far.", "This is called gaslighting, your NTA, but you might be one to yourself if you stay in a relationship that toxic\u2026", "NTA\n\nThis guy is truly gaslighting you. He's doing things like deleting your messages, and then making you believe you did it, giving some silly bullshit reason as to why, and making you question your memory.\n\nHe says he deleted the \"helloooooo\" messages because of negativity. How is that negative? Is it just a greeting, or more like a \"helloooo are you there\"? Because either way, helloooo doesn't scream negative to me.", "NTA and also: Girl, get out. Get out now. I don't care how great a boyfriend he is in any other way, he violated your privacy on multiple occasions, lied about it repeatedly, continued to lie, and then has the audacity to continue to challenge your version of events you experienced.\n\nHe is actively trying to make it harder for you to remember the truth of things. That's 10 red flags in a row. On fire.\n\nI know people here throw the word GASLIGHT around way too much, but this right here is it. He is taking away your tool for remembering things he said and did so he can argue with you or change the narrative. The fact that he's doing it over \"little\" things like the date he joined a church or how he types hello doesn't mean this isn't bad.\n\nHe will continue this behavior and it will escalate. Get. Out. Now.", "NTA.    You cannot trust this man.  He deleted things on your phone.  He \u201csnuck\u201d to do it.  He lied, then confessed.  He has done it more than once.

Most calendar apps also have a locking feature.", "NTA. Lock your phone and dump this guy.", "NTA but he Is.

It's as if he would wait for you to go to sleep, then rip pages out of your diary. That being said, you sound insufferable, and I would hate to be in a relationship where the other person refers back to their notes while we are in a fight.

You are keeping notes of your boyfriend\u2019s missteps for future reference and he is violating your privacy to delete them and lying about it. Get out of this relationship now.   \n\nI think that you need to consider some therapy and self growth before entering another serious relationship. I do not mean this as an insult!! You are very young, and life and relationships are hard. Some guidance as to how a healthy relationship looks is helpful for most of us!", "ESH. Yeah, going through your phone and deleting things off it was not a nice thing to do.\n\nBut you are keeping scores to a maladive point. You are keeping track of every negative thing your bf says/do and use your notes and message history to shove them back in his face. I don't blame him for being frustrated about it. No matter what he does, he'll never be good enough and every single little mistakes end ups being recorded and documented so they can be used against him at a later time. It's not fair to him that he has to live like that.", "YTA . why on earth would you keep notes to remind you when he did something wrong. you need to forgive and forget if you are ever going to make this relationship work.\n\nit sounds less like you keeping notes to remind you, and more like keeping score of when he was wrong and you were right.\n\nyou all need some therapy to find out why you have this compulsion to take notes and use them every time you have an argument. \n\nYour partner is not TA, i don't blame him for removing all your obsessive notes about him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
