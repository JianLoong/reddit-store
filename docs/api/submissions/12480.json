I don't know if he just flat out can't get here, or if it'll just be tricky. If he doesn't attend, then obviously a decision will be made in his absence.

They also appear to take into account how the parents are behaving towards each other. Check in with your solicitor that your refusal to postpone will not be taken as aggressive to your ex or count in any way as a negative against you. He could well be playing the system to gain some advantage.

Thank you!", "Thank you. That's a fair point; it could have been brought to a close last time, for now at least, but he kept pushing.\n\nI honestly don't know why neither me or my solicitor were unaware of the new date, I can't say if it was malicious but I'm glad he mentioned it tbh, else I'd have had no clue and might have missed it myself.", "Thank you, I appreciate it. \n\nI mean, that was my thinking. Like it's a really important thing, it's not someone's birthday he'd be missing; this is about our child.\n\nThat is also very true.

It's a really important thing.\n\nI don't think he would extend the same courtesy, tbh. He is good at playing the victim and knows how to manipulate me into feeling sorry for him, and I don't want him to succeed yet again.\n\nI hope it's the last of it as well; I really appreciate your response.", "Thank you! \n\nI will definitely discuss it further with my solicitor. I've explained why I wouldn't want to postpone.\n\nThat's true; I have fought tooth and nail to keep my daughter with me, despite all the mud slinging from my ex. I could tell some real horror stories about his behaviour.\n\nI have brought up the violations in the past, and nothing has been done about it for whatever reason. \n\nI did ask my solicitor if I was likely to get full custody at this stage, but she said it's highly unlikely. Plus, my kiddo still wants contact, and there's no reason she shouldn't have it, legally speaking. The past has been wholly dismissed, so there isn't much I can do right now.\n\nI appreciate your response; and yes, exactly.

Exactly, he's the one who wanted to drag it out, and I've had enough of it tbh.", "Thank you; yeah, I really can't tell any more. I have gone above and beyond many times, to ensure he has uninterrupted contact, and I really don't want to be manipulated again. \n\nMy solicitor said that the court will need a reason if I choose not to postpone, and I cited the fact that I just want to bring this process to a close sooner rather than later because it's draining and stressful. So if it can be over for now, I'd prefer that.", "I guess I just worried that I was being a jerk from a moral perspective, or being petty.\n\nI read the latest email from my solicitor after I posted here, and they said that it's up to me, basically. The court needs my consent to postpone, but they also need me to give a reason if I choose NOT to postpone.\n\nThanks for your repsonse!", "Thanks for your reply; and yes, that is very true. My solicitor said that if I don't postpone, then I need to explain why to the court. Honestly don't know about my ex, but yes, I'm not sure why he came straight to me to ask instead of my solicitor. I know that they can't postpone without my consent, so maybe my ex was trying to manipulate me, who knows.", "Thank you for your reply. From what my solicitor said, we could postpone, but only with my consent and a reason for not postponing.\n\nHe doesn't have a lawyer, never has through this whole process, so he has nobody advising him.

I don't think my husband was defending him as such; I just think he wants me to be able to move on and not be bitter about things.

Yes, he did want it, and he has gotten time off for every other hearing. It's a really important event, it's not a night out at the pub or something. I don't get it at all.", "Thank you for your reply. That's what I was thinking; it's a really important event. If my boss didn't give me time off for something like this, I'd tell them I'm going regardless! Especially as he pushed for this hearing to happen!\n\nThe court don't take historical abuse into account, unfortunately. And at the start of this whole fiasco, my ex did all the mud slinging he could in order to level the playing field; and he still hasn't got his way with this, and he is not happy about it.", "Thank you. Exactly, I don't want to drag this out any more, I have enough going on.", "Thank you for replying. You do indeed play to win; not sure why he can't get time off now when he has in the past. I'm kind suspish but there we go. I just want to get this over with, tbh.", "Thank you. Yeah, that's my thoughts on it. He has always got time off for hearings in the past, so it's kinda odd in my mind.\n\nYou're right, it's not just my personal feelings. This whole situation has taken a huge toll on my health, which wasn't great to start with. I can do without the stress and extra emotional baggage.", "Yes! I was looking to see if anyone else would mention the current husband. I wasn\u2019t thinking that he wants the step daughter to go back to the ex, but that him saying it\u2019s petty not to change the date makes me wonder about him. Refusing to let the ex hold this over OP\u2019s head is petty? Definitely side eying current husband on that.", "Thank you; yeah exactly, I don't understand why the wouldn't give him time off, unless he hasn't told them what it's for or something. But he's attended every other hearing with no problem, so I don't get why it's suddenly an issue.\n\nNooo, that isn't what my husband meant, he just meant that it's petty to not change the court date. Technically there's no reason why I can't agree to change it, but I feel some type of way about it, tbh. Hubs definitely doesn't want kiddo to live with my ex.", "Thank you so much; I was so worried that I was being a jerk.\n\nI thought it was kinda out of line for him to ask, but I honestly wasn't sure. He has made it as difficult as he can from the start; some of the things I could share would horrify anyone in their right mind.\n\nI am and will continue to do what's best for my kiddo; thanks again.", "yna?", "Thank you; yeah, it's a really important thing and if he has been honest with his boss, I can't see why they wouldn't allow time off.", "That's what I was thinking? Thank you.", "He doesn't have a solicitor and hasn't since the beginning. He could've done with one, tbh.\n\nI think he came to me instead of my solicitor because he knows how to manipulate me into feeling sorry for him, because he is always the victim, no matter what.\n\nI will be referring him to my solicitor if he asks again.\n\nETA Thank you for your reply!", "That's how it feels, ngl. He is a very controlling person, and I know why, but it doesn't make it okay and I don't want to be bullied any more.\n\nI honestly don't know; my solicitor said she will speak to the court and see what's going on. It just doesn't add up and I don't know what's going on, tbh.\n\nThank you, I really appreciate it!", "Thank you for your reply.\n\nYeah, I was surprised when he mentioned it. If he hadn't said anything, I worry that I'd have missed it. \n\nI will make sure my solicitor gets in the loop, because I've no clue why she hadn't heard anything, as she would have called/ emailed me. I hope my ex wouldn't stoop that low; fingers crossed that it was just a misunderstanding!", "Thanks for your reply!\n\nI don't think you're wrong about that, tbh. \n\nThat's what I think is best for me and kiddo. She and I both have enough to deal with.\n\nHe doesn't have a solicitor, which is probably why he came to me first, partly. He can speak to my solicitor about it next time, for sure.\n\nThat is what the court suggested, and you just reminded me, so thank you! I am downloading an app now.

If that was his aim, he will find that isn't the case. Thanks for your reply!", "No, don't suggest anything.  Stop talking to him.  You aren't his mom, and it's not your job to help him abuse you through the court.  Anything he has to say, he can say to your lawyer.", "Are you crazy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDON't do anything.

Make it so unbelievably hard for him that he loses all hope of any success.  Destroy his will to fight and he will stop fighting.", "I really don't know what his reasoning was for saying it's petty, because he usually backs me up when it comes to my ex, and not letting him manipulate me.\n\nI said to him that I don't want to postpone, and why do I need to make life easier for my ex? Like I really didn't feel like budging on this; but then hubs said it was kinda petty and then I started doubting myself. I just wanted an outside perspective, you know? \n\nI'm sure hubs didn't mean anything by it; he just doesn't hold the memories and the trauma that I have.", "Okay I was worried. Honestly don't change it anything you do is more fodder for whatever delusions he has and if you change it once you'll have to change it 1000 times because he'll think he can control it. That's the reason not to change it.", "Good job Mom. \n\nI know what this can be like to go through witnessing my bio dad pull shit like this when I was little in court and was an abusive asshole and pull stunts like this as well.

I will refer him straight to my solicitor if he asks again.", "I shouldn't have asked my solicitor if my ex can attend via video link? :/ \n\nCan you tell I've been abused and brainwashed my whole life? I'm not consciously trying to make it easier for him, honestly. I don't know if my solicitor will suggest that to him, I just asked if it was a possibility, but now you point it out, I see it; and no, it's not my responsibility to help him.", "I will never be his number one fan; whether he has changed his ways, I don't know. I feel like I never even knew the guy, tbh. He was a monster. I'm not sure, because if he hadn't mentioned it, I may well have missed it.", "I'm trying to stand my ground. I stopped contact for the best part of a year because I wasn't going to let him get away with the bullshit he was pulling on my kiddo. Hubs thinks ex was broken by that. But as soon as my ex said he wanted residency of kiddo, I had second thoughts, you know? \n\nMy ex took kiddo out of the country without telling me, and that was the final straw. It was just for a holiday, but who tf cares; he violated the court order, he took the piss big time, and I wasn't going to tolerate it any more.\n\nThe court social worker was a lying, two-faced, gaslighting meddler, and she recommended that my ex has residency if I stopped contact again. It's been a frigging nightmare. \n\nI am still very much in a place where I find it hard to stand up for myself and have firm boundaries. I won't let my child live with my ex, and I can do it for kiddo. She is the only reason I keep going in any capacity.", "I really appreciate your concern, it's very kind of you. I don't see why any reasonable employer wouldn't give him time off, especially when they have in the past.\n\nHe has accused me so many times of trying to control this whole situation... like I'm doing this for fun or something.

Yeah, I'm not inclined to cut him slack for many reasons, just don't want it to be for the wrong reasons, you know?\n\nI'm just baffled as to why he's suddenly struggling to get time off for it. I just want to do the right thing and it feels like a minefield.", "Why is she the asshole if he can get time off?

Let the legal system be a buffer between you and him whenever possible. \n\nFor your current husband idk if you are comfortable going into detail with him about what happened to you but I would 100% have him hear some testimony about abusive exs and the control they wield.

I just need to remind myself that I don't owe him anything.", "I honestly can't tell, I just know he is manipulative. Very true; and yes, I will refer him to my solicitor if he asks again.\n\nI have told my husband most of what happened, but I don't know if he understands the psychology behind it.

It just doesn't add up, either way.", "I feel for you but I can't help you because you don't want to listen to what is going on", "It's not so much that I don't want to listen to what's going on, it's more that I have experienced abuse from childhood, and it continues to this day. It makes it so hard to trust my own judgement, and I doubt myself so much. I also don't like assuming the worst about people, and I'm trying so hard to be neutral about my ex, and not assume he is lying, even though it wouldn't surprise me and he has lied about so many things. I don't think he ever truly cared about me. He's like a dragon with his gold, and his child is the gold."]}
