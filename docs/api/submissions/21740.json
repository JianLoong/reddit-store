They have 3 young kids and their stuff is strewn everywhere. I hate messes, won\u2019t even have a single dirty dish in my sink but I would never go over and clean my daughter\u2019s home whether she was there or not unless she specifically asked for my help-which she never would. Her and SIL do not have to keep their home cleanliness up to my standards. BF\u2019s mom is the AH for completely overstepping her boundaries even if she meant well. Also my daughter is very sensitive to smells of soaps and cleaner. Everything they use is non scented so even if I ever did cleaned her home I would use only products she has.", "NTA. Just a guess here: Is Mom a single parent to your boyfriend / recently divorced/widowed ? I\u2019m asking this because my Mom would have totally done this years ago. It\u2019s because they don\u2019t have a lot to fill their time- and she hasn\u2019t cut the apron strings with her son. If you see a future with your boyfriend, it may be time to put some boundaries in place for the next visit. Or when you visit her at her place, be like omg Judy I want to re-pay the favor and clean your house. You did such an awesome job with mine. She may take you up on it, but I don\u2019t think she will clean your apartment again.", "NTA\n\nIt might be a big shame that you've had an allergic reaction to all the scented soaps you've found in your house... so that you won't be able to spend much time with his family. You need to recover after you remove them all from you house.  Let his mother know all of this.\n\nI hope your boyfriend will back you up on this too.", "\"Air fresheners\" and carpet powders stink, and make me feel unwell.  I'd have to clean the whole place again to get rid of the chemical stench.\n\nActions speak louder than words: MiL is criticising your standards of housekeeping and by using her choice of product is enforcing her dominance. \n\nI agree with the poster who said she's literally scent marking your home.\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA - surely she knows it is bad manners to visit somebody's home and clean it for them !!\n\nShe is telling her boy that you arn't a good enough ' wife' for him, that you don't do the cleaning to her standards - that's the message !!", "The question here is whether you can accept a future where your potential MIL keeps trumping over your boundaries and feelings and your BF does nothing/defends her.

I get she was maybe trying to be helpful or feel useful. However, as someone who is also sensitive to fragrances, if there were unfamiliar scents in my home, I would end up with migraines and nausea.

That he excuses her with \"that's just how she is\" is a huge red flag bc it says that he will concede to anything she wants.\n\nBF and his Mom just showed you who they are. I hope you are paying attention, OP.", "She confronts mama directly. Now she has set a precedent. Mama's boy knows he can shirk his responsibility forever, as his bad-ass gf will handle her for him...", "I think the OP should make a big deal about it, it was a violation of her home, and she had told the BF to tell her to stop. She'd be totally right to ban the mom from their home. That kind of intentional boundary violation is not tolerable. The BF is also a total AH because she'd told him many times that stressed her out and she was sensitive to strong scents, but the mom goes and buys a bunch of things with strong smells? Total AH. OP should be rethinking her relationship honestly.", "Oh no. If OP doesn't make a big deal out of it, MIL will want to come over and change things to her liking whenever she wants. If this was just about cleaning, she would have used the supplies at hand. This was about showing OP the \"right\" way to do things and prove she's the queen bee.\n\nOP, not the asshole. I don't even let my mom clean my place when she visits. You're well within your right to tell your BF that he needs to ensure his mom minds her business and never do this again, and apologize for imposing herself onto their space.", ">Cut out mama\u2019s boy and just confront her directly, if you want change.\n\nExactly opposite of what needs to happen.

He said it\u2019s bc his family is Hispanic and that all of the mother figures in his family do this same thing and that\u2019s just the culture of his family. Im trying to understand that, it\u2019s just really overwhelming", "BF, not husband so even worse boundary stomping.", "I think its mommy's way of showing she doesn't approve of the relationship, by pretending to \"help\" but doing it in a way she knows OP does not want.", "I agree. Mom knew *exactly* what she was doing; she was marking territory, with son's house standing in for son himself.", "I agree that he is responsible, but clearly he is unwilling to take on that responsibility. OP would be better served taking action that will be effective rather than to listen to us telling her her boyfriend should do it, and then have him keep refusing to.", "My wife is Hispanic, and I'm part Hispanic also, as are many of our friends, including some first-generation immigrants. None of them would even think of acting like that at all; it might be a (very negative) family trait but it's not because they're Hispanic. Honestly, it sounds more like something a Hispanic mom would do to show disapproval, especially if she knew you were sensitive to smells.", "Yeah she didn\u2019t have good intentions, like another commenter said it was passive aggressive. The conversation with the bf when she got home was interesting, he was getting frustrated that his mom was unhappy with him asking her to respect OP\u2019s feelings/boundaries. So his mom\u2019s feelings about being told to respect someone\u2019s personal space and his momentary discomfort are more important than his girlfriend\u2019s likely day long stress and anxiety", "OP needs to gather all the cleaning products,  carpet smelly and soaps and send them home with the mom. Tell her they are not needed and not what you prefer.", "OK, so she confronts mama directly.  Now she has set a precedent.  Mama's boy knows he can shirk his responsibility forever, as his bad-ass gf will handle her for him...", "Thank you, that\u2019s what I was thinking too that was just the explanation he offered me and I didn\u2019t understand it", "Yes 100%.", "Yeah, what do you want me to do about it? I can\u2019t fix her boyfriend, stop being silly.", "Yes; I edited my post to say it honestly sounds more like something a Hispanic mom would do to show disapproval; especially if she knew you were sensitive to strong smells. As for your BF offering that explanation, many Hispanic guys will defend their mothers no matter what, right or wrong, against anyone, including wives and GFs so I think you're seeing some of that.", "OK, if boyfriend can't be fixed, you exchange him for a new one.  Nothing silly about that.", "Sure, and you can write your own response to OP and tell her that. I gave my take and whether you agree matters little to me. This is about OP, not you or me."]}
