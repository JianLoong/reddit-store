I told my mom about it laughing (it was pretty funny walking in on him covered in bright red lipstick) and she apologized a lot.

Very straightforward and happy to resolve the issue.

I suspect this is the one of the first times your mom has realized you aren\u2019t a kid who she can just push around/direct to her wishes as opposed to the adult with their own identity and household. It can be rough during that transition (and can take forever depending on how stubborn she is).

She is the entitled one. She and her husband were not watching their kid, he got into someone\u2019s stuff and ruined it. The right thing to do is to pay for it.", "NTA My half brother is 14 years younger than me. He was a great little kid, but he did break things and get into stuff sneaking around. My mom loved him and he would come and stay with me at her house. I paid for everything he messed up there if my mom's and my roommate's. My dad and stepmom always paid me back if they could afford to. My own kid broke a $500 lamp once. That was a big ouch. It comes down to if it's your kid or you're the one responsible for them (within reason ?), you pay for the shit they screw up and break.", "NTA ... your request was not entitled at all. \"Family\" is never a good argument for anything.\n\nI am kinda bewildered by the fact that mom didn't ask you first how much it would cost to replace it.\n\nIt's not your job to take care of the toddler or his behaviour. It's the parents' and theirs alone.\n\nThey decided to have another kid. Noone else. They are responsible for everything the toddler does and all the consequences that come from it. That's the deal when you become parents. If you can't swallow that up, you are unfit to be parents. It's really that simple. I am fed up by the onslaugh of excuses that parents come up with and the entitlement on their side how \"familyyyy\" has to help raise their children...no..they don't have to do that.\n\nSo...kudos to your step-dad!\n\nYou are totally fine OP. You handled the situation well and very calmly.\n\nI am sorry that you are questioning your position :(", "NTA, it's reasonable to ask people to replace shit that their kids destroy.\n\nNo you're not the asshole here", "NTA. Your toddler brother was left unsupervised and you only asked for what he destroyed to be replaced. It is not your responsibility to watch him unless you had been explicitly asked.", "ESH. Mom could just have said no.  Ranting not needed.   You left the bag where the boy could get to it.   It's a commonsense thing that there's no excuse for.", "You may have some lessons to learn regarding family. It would be understandable to ask for compensation if the kid wasn't your brother. Family covers each other's mistake. Especially a 2 year old.\n\nNAH just because you're naive.", "YTA you didn't put your things where he could not get to them. What if it had been medication or something else harmful?  You are the adult common sense should have kicked in.", "YTA - Confronting your mom about a ruined lipstick on Thanksgiving while you are in their home is petty.", "I agree. But also, after this learning experience, if it happens again because OP leaves her things where the toddler can access them, she can partially blame herself. Imo, it's similar to telling your guests that they need to put their shoes into the closet because the puppy will otherwise chew them.  If you intentionally ignore instructions meant to keep your property safe, I'm not paying for it to be replaced.", "And OP cleaned up the mess and the kid, too, which couldn't have been a quick chore. How long did they ignore their kid that OP had time for all that? They need to be watching a toddler way closer than than.", "I think that \u201cfamily covers each other\u2019s mistake\u201d depends on each family\u2019s specific culture. Some families are like that and some aren\u2019t. Since she\u2019s an adult who was raised in this family and she doesn\u2019t have that awareness, seems like this isn\u2019t a family that has raised her that way.", "It was on top of the bathroom counter (where all my bathroom stuff was as well as theirs), he can\u2019t reach the counter but I think he opened the drawers and laddered himself up there. Yeah I guess I should\u2019ve known better but it\u2019s not like I left it on the floor next to his toy truck, I left it where my mom leaves all her stuff too", "Making sure the kid doesn't get into stuff he shouldn't is still the parents' job not OP's", "It was yesterday, the day after thanksgiving.", "Yo that's also what's getting me, like how was nobody watching a toddler for that long? That's just dangerous", "Agree. But having her mother shocked that she asked for payment tells that she expected to understand the mistake.", "NTA it was destroyed and you should get a new one at their expense."]}
