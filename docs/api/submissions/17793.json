I'll stop responding as i have to figure out a few things. Thanks to everybody here, wish me luck lol!\n\nI (26M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F), let's call her \"Bambi,\" for about 1.5 years now. Bambi is a delightfully eccentric individual, which is what attracted me to her in the first place. She\u2019s a passionate interpretive dancer - think twirling around in the park to the tune of bird songs, not the kind of stuff you see on Broadway. I've always supported her passion, despite it being a bit out of my wheelhouse. I'm more of a \"sit on the couch and watch football\" kind of guy.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Bambi excitedly announced that she\u2019s been working on a dance recital, a one-woman show that represents the journey of our relationship. While I was flattered, I was also slightly horrified. Now, I love Bambi, but her interpretive dances tend to be... let's just say \"unconventional.\"\n\nThis past week, she gave me a sneak preview of the show - which included interpretive movements of our first date, our first fight, and, brace yourselves, our first time in the bedroom. There was a lot of rolling around on the floor, and at one point, she mimed out an argument we had over who used the last of the toilet paper (I still maintain it was her).\n\nThe final straw came when she performed an interpretive rendition of a particularly nasty bout of food poisoning we both got from bad takeout. Let\u2019s just say that her depiction of the aftermath was so vivid, I nearly relived the experience right then and there.\n\nSeeing all of this, I told her that I couldn't attend the recital. I said that while I appreciate her talent and her creativity, I'm not comfortable with our private moments being shared with a room full of strangers. This led to a huge fight. She accused me of not supporting her art and told me that if I loved her, I would be at the show, front row and center.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for not wanting to watch my girlfriend twirl around on stage in a metaphorical reenactment of our relationship, including our most intimate and sometimes awkward moments? Or should I just suck it up and wear my best game face while she mimics the time I tripped and fell into a duck pond on our third date?", "created_utc": 1684632424, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nf2br/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_girlfriends/", "score": 1425, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's pretty upset and feels like I'm not supporting her or her art. It's got me wondering if I'm being the jerk here, not wanting our personal life turned into a public performance, and prioritizing that over supporting my girlfriend.

Nah, stand your ground when you feel uncomfortable in any circumstance.", "NTA - Just thinking about the dance makes me uncomfortable for you. I realize that a lot of art is derived from real life, but that does not mean you have to watch an interpretation of your own life if you don't want to. Free will and all.", "NTA - You're allowed to not share in on her hobbies/interests.\n\nMy husband and I have been together 20 years in total. We don't like all the exact same things. It's wild to assume you will. She may however, feel like it's a gift for you, considering the topic. So tread lightly, but don't do something you're not into.", "NTA, that sounds awkward af. She should have some respect now that you have voiced your displeasure at your personal life being overshared. You two need to discuss it rationally and without arguing. Best of luck to you both.", "NTA.  But why would you NOT go?  This sounds spectacularly awful and cheesy in the best way possible.  Like Moira Rose doing a crow levels of cheesy.   So entertaining. Can I go?", "NTA While she's allowed to feel disappointed that you don't want to attend, you're allowed to feel uncomfortable going to a performance portraying personal parts of your life.  I'm also going to assume that if you do attend, she will tell the audience who you are. \n\nIf she really wants to share this with you, and you're comfortable doing so, have someone record the performance so you two can watch it together alone.  But only if you're comfortable.", "NTA Just the way she's expressive and likes to put intimate parts of her life out there in the form of art, you on the other hand seem to be more private. You're both allowed to be who you are. I would also be uncomfortable with private moments being shared in a room full of strangers. I don't think not showing up means you don't support or love her. If you're able to suck it up and show up for it anyway just to make her happy then I don't find too much harm in doing that, but definitely not front and center that;'s asking for too much :-P", "NAH\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be expected to do anything that makes you uncomfortable, but your girlfriend was reasonable in her expectation that you would want to support her. \n\nI wish you\u2019d tell us where she\u2019s performing.

I've been invited to a few interpretive dance gatherings, so I know that they can certainly get pretty intense and personal. Perhaps for her and the rest of her dance group, her performance doesn't seem particularly out of the ordinary. And of course, you should support your partner's interests and encourage her to express herself, even if it is not in a way that resonates with you. \n\nThat being said, I think this crosses the line from her expecting your support to her being inconsiderate of your own boundaries and desire for privacy. Depending on how... graphically the events are depicted (and from what you shared, it sounds like very), it's hard not to wonder if she may be experiencing some level of resentment toward you that she is creatively channeling into her dance. It definitely sounds like you two would benefit from better communication and a mutual effort to understand and honor each other's boundaries, should you get past this situation.", "If the dance was about a more neutral topic I\u2019d be telling you to go along and be supportive, even if it\u2019s not your favourite. But a dance that graphically depicts your relationship, which I feel should have involved your consent before she even created it, is absolutely your right to object to. NTA in this instance. \nDid she ever ask you if you\u2019re ok with her creating this dance and showing it publicly? Did she explain what it would involve? If so, what did you say? If she didn\u2019t ask your consent to share those type of private details, that would pretty much be a dealbreaker for me..I\u2019d feel quite violated.", "NTA I think your a saint for being okay with her doing the performance at all. The subject matter she picked was intensely personal to the both of you. I would be mortified.", ">So, Reddit, AITA for not wanting to watch my girlfriend twirl around on stage in a metaphorical reenactment of our relationship, including our most intimate and sometimes awkward moments? Or should I just suck it up and wear my best game face while she mimics the time I tripped and fell into a duck pond on our third date?\n\nThere's an Archie comic story in which Veronica's boyfriend Archie falls asleep and snores when she plays a lullaby during her piano recital.

She probably won\u2019t agree but you can argue that you want to support her but it would be very embarrassing to have your private life public and you do not want to be there if she opens up your relationship to strangers", "NTA but this sounds like a must see.\n\nETA:  DO NOT tell your friends and family about this because one of them would be a me who would just have to see it.", "I understand her feelings here, but really she should have checked if this was ok with you. Let her know that you can simultaneously love that your relationship inspires her art and be uncomfortable in the presence of the art itself. No one likes to be\u2014 for lack of a better term\u2014 outed. Personally, I\u2019d suck it up and go and be there for her, but that\u2019s because Ive been in her shoes.

There's not much to be said. It might be cringe to you but it seems to be VERY important to her. That's something to consider.", "NTA, but maybe you should go. The way she introduces and performs the dance will tell you a lot about how she views your relationship, and whether she interprets the events in a more abstract (without comments) or concrete way (pointing out who you are, telling the stories that go with the dance, etc.). If it's really bad, it's best if you see it so you can make decisions and do damage control, especially if mutual friends see it.

Cringe inducing perhaps, but also really kind of sweet. So I definitely think you would be NTA if you didnt go, but it would be pretty great if you did.
