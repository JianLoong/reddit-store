I recently turned 24 years old. This was my first birthday since I was 16.  \nOn my birthday, Selena, one of my friends, proposed we went to a club. My three other friends came and Selena's older brother, David, who was like 12 years old than us tagged along. I never really spoke to David because I was not even that close to Selena.  \nDavid is a single dad. His ex-wife was his high school sweetheart, and they even had a cute little girl named Sarah, though they had gotten divorced like four years ago. His ex is in a relationship with somebody else, who also has a kid. While we were talking, David, who was a nice individual, agreed to help me with my book.  \nWe had a great first date, but as we continued talking, David started receiving calls from his former wife. I initially thought that this was about his daughter, Sarah(fake name). When I questioned David about the situation, he said that it was about his ex. Apparently, she was ranting to him about her boyfriend being distant and possibly cheating.  \nDuring our date, I asked David if it was appropriate for him to talk to his ex-wife while we were on our first date. I would have been okay if it was his about his kid because as a child from a single mother who always prioritized her rich boyfriend over me. I understood, but it was about his ex.  \nHe apologized for my frustration, and he said that he keeps a close relationship with his ex so that Sarah would have a positive environment. He said that he had no other option and said that when he prioritizes his child, it also applies to his wife. Our date passed by quickly, and by the end of it, he asked for another one. I told him no that I don\u2019t think I want my first relationship where I am second to his ex. He still calls to check up on me, hoping I changed my mind, but I just don\u2019t think I am ready for that. And I don\u2019t want to start a relationship where I get to know his kid and leave because I am too insecure to get past his ex and him. It won\u2019t be fair to Sarah.  \nI am typing this just two hours after Selena sent a voicemail message stating that I was insecure and said I was gross for rejecting a single dad. As I said, I have no problems with putting kids first. I just don\u2019t think, as a young adult, I want to live my life knowing that his ex would always come first.

I think I was just excited that he was the first man to ask me out. The first man who truly wanted to be with me, and I did not give myself time to think about how things could go wrong. I know that action would label me as an asshole because I was ready to go on a date because of my feelings, and I did not fully set David's feelings into the table. At first, I did not believe that I was the asshole, but when Selena called and said I rejected him because he was a single dad, it made me think. I know that there are other people who have ex's and they might still be close to them, but this one is different David has a bond with his ex-wife, something that I might never have with him. So, even if I initially, did not reject him for being a single dad. I still think that it ties to it at a point, if I am being honest.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have gone on the date at all. \n\nYou are young and in a different stage of your life. You just don\u2019t want to start a relationship with an instant family where the child (rightly) and ex (weirdly aside from functions as the mom) will come first. \n\nYou are allowed to want a different future for yourself. \n\nSelena is an AH. \n\nThe single dad is doing the best he can, but it sounds like his boundaries with his ex are nonexistent and that doesn\u2019t work for you. That\u2019s your prerogative.\n\nIncidentally, as great as it is to maintain a relationship with your child\u2019s other parent, it\u2019s pretty rude to take non emergency calls while you\u2019re on a date.", "NTA- There seems like a lot of drama already, and it\u2019s not worth getting into. You\u2019re only 24, there\u2019s no need to complicate your life with someone else\u2019s situation.", "NTA, I would be the same way and there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to be a priority. It\u2019s better to be upfront in the beginning rather get into a relationship so deep and can\u2019t find a way out.", "NTA - it\u2019s rude to take phone calls from friends during a date to listen to them vent about their problems. Because that\u2019s basically what happened here, even if it is an ex. I could understand him answering to initially see if it was about their kid but as soon as she started venting he should have mentioned it was a bad time and he would talk to her later.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s over her", "NTA\n\nI stopped dating men with kids because I have no desire to be a mom or a stepmom. So, no point in starting something that already has an expiration date, right? But, before I was one hundred percent about not dating fathers, I had a rule of *emergency communication only* during our time together. I ran into your scenario too many times, just nonsense about how they had to take the call or reply to the text because it's their kid's mom and they need to remain friendly. Sure, fine, but it's not unfriendly to quick-reply that you aren't available for the next three hours, or to give a heads up that unless it's an emergency, you won't be around to chat on Friday night. IDK what it is about divorced men who think that unless they stop on a dime for their ex, their kid will suffer for all eternity.", "NTA. Good on you for knowing your boundaries and what you don't want in a partner.", "NTA...\n\nThis is what happens with a lot of newly divorced fathers.  They're great guys but you will never be their first priority.\n\nI dated a guy for about a year.  He was newly divorced with three children and living with his dad.  I wasn't even his third priority.  I came after the dog.  Literally, he missed a date with me because his father's dog was ill.  He had missed dates before over his children's ball games (I asked if I could come and he said no) and once he took me book shopping for his ex-wife's birthday present.\n\nThe experience taught me that I wanted/deserved to be a higher priority.", "NTA there are several red flags \ud83d\udea9run.", "Absolutely NTA!\n\nChildren come first yes but next is your partner and his Ex is no longer his partner. \n\nEven if it wasn\u2019t as bad as it sounds(him being far too emotionally attached to an ex), you know your boundaries and put yourself first. You even put the child high on the priority list in this decision. You made a sound decision with impeccable reasoning.", "NTA\n\nHe's more interested in his ex's drama than he is in you. It doesn't matter if he says it's to preserve his co-parent relationship, it's not ok to do that to a new partner ever. Him doing it on the first date just means that you can pass before you get entangled.\n\nHe's 36 years old. I don't care that his ex was his high school sweetheart, he's old enough to know that you put your phone down on the first date. If you can't be bothered to engage with your date, why should they waste their time on you a second time?\n\nAnd Selena is so far out of line by inserting herself into a situation that doesn't involve her and insulting you that I would rethink that friendship.", "nta. You have the right to date who you want to do, Selena should keep her nose out of it  unless you asked her for advice. If it was me, I'd block both numbers.", "NTA. You\u2019re right, if the calls had been about his daughter it would have been one thing, but he isn\u2019t emotionally available for a relationship.", "NTA. You\u2019re just protecting yourself and the child. That\u2019s okay, don\u2019t let your friend make you feel bad <3", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely in the right to expect that any relationship you may have (first, second, twelfth, whatever) that your partner puts *you* first. Obviously with a single parent there are going to be times where they are going to put their **child** first, as they should, but it\u2019s totally wrong for them to expect you to basically share them and their time with the ex-partner. You can have a decent relationship with an ex, without the need to be IN their lives. Unfortunately for David, he has yet to realise this or have the balls toe force boundaries with his ex. \n\nTell Selena to go forth and multiply and that if she\u2019s happy to be a third wheel in a relationship then bully for her. You\u2019ve got more self respect than that.", "NTA I am guessing that Selena and you are similar age.  That would put this guy 12 years older than you, with a kid.  You have not had a serious relationship and he is divorced.  To many differences Tell Selena that you are looking for someone closer to your age as well as someone that does not spend the entire date talking to another woman on the phone while ignoring you.", "NTA. This is a fair boundary to have and something a lot of women would not put up with. There's nothing wrong with him having a good relationship with his ex but to the point where it interferes while on a date when you aren't even in a relationship wow. Sounds like he needs to set boundaries of his own otherwise he'll be single for a while. At least you were not putting up with it in hopes it may change", "NTA. You want balanced relationship with your own family as first priority. Your friend is TA for pushing you into dating with man who puts his ex first.", "NTA - You are wise beyond your years. Keep it up.", "NTA. You\u2019re a smart girl for knowing yourself well enough to know you can\u2019t navigate this relationship. Plenty of people have these boundaries. I am 43 (f) single no children and I don\u2019t want to date a single dad either. I chose not to have kids I also choose not to be a step mother", "NTA", "NTA you don't have to deal with that kind of baggage. You would not be the AH for saying no to All single parents.  There is no reason to settle like that", "NTA.\nIt\u2019s always bad form to make a first date about an ex; taking calls or texts just because your ex wants to vent? Super gross.\nHe can have a good relationship w his ex for his daughter and not make a date about the ex.\nWild your friend is upset at you!\nThe guy isn\u2019t in a space to be dating, he hasn\u2019t truly walked away from his previous life.", "NTA. He's taking long involved phone calls from his ex on your first date? He's got zero boundaries and limited social skills. You don't owe anyone a second date and you don't owe your friend anything regarding your decision to not date her brother.", "NTA.  You have to find a relationship that works for you.    You\u2019re wise not to get entangled in a situation in which I you\u2019re not comfortable.", "NTA\n\nHe answered the phone in the middle of a date to discuss his ex-wife\u2019s boyfriend??? His ex-wife will of course be in his life. They share a child together. But there\u2019s a difference between positive co-parenting, and stopping everything to address a none emergency for an ex. He doesn\u2019t need to cater to her in order to have a peaceful parenting relationship. This isn\u2019t about insecurity. It\u2019s about being inappropriate. If he isn\u2019t willing to live his life, then he\u2019s not ready for a relationship. Tell Selena she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. If she\u2019s not willing to listen, send her your post.", "So proud of you for knowing your worth and knowing what you deserve.", "Hey don\u2019t worry not your problem.

You can be a good parent by being on the same page about parenting, being civil with each other, and communicating positively with each other about the child and each other.
