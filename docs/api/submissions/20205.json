I recently turned 24 years old. This was my first birthday since I was 16.  \nOn my birthday, Selena, one of my friends, proposed we went to a club. My three other friends came and Selena's older brother, David, who was like 12 years old than us tagged along. I never really spoke to David because I was not even that close to Selena.  \nDavid is a single dad. His ex-wife was his high school sweetheart, and they even had a cute little girl named Sarah, though they had gotten divorced like four years ago. His ex is in a relationship with somebody else, who also has a kid. While we were talking, David, who was a nice individual, agreed to help me with my book.  \nWe had a great first date, but as we continued talking, David started receiving calls from his former wife. I initially thought that this was about his daughter, Sarah(fake name). When I questioned David about the situation, he said that it was about his ex. Apparently, she was ranting to him about her boyfriend being distant and possibly cheating.  \nDuring our date, I asked David if it was appropriate for him to talk to his ex-wife while we were on our first date. I would have been okay if it was his about his kid because as a child from a single mother who always prioritized her rich boyfriend over me. I understood, but it was about his ex.  \nHe apologized for my frustration, and he said that he keeps a close relationship with his ex so that Sarah would have a positive environment. He said that he had no other option and said that when he prioritizes his child, it also applies to his wife. Our date passed by quickly, and by the end of it, he asked for another one. I told him no that I don\u2019t think I want my first relationship where I am second to his ex. He still calls to check up on me, hoping I changed my mind, but I just don\u2019t think I am ready for that. And I don\u2019t want to start a relationship where I get to know his kid and leave because I am too insecure to get past his ex and him. It won\u2019t be fair to Sarah.  \nI am typing this just two hours after Selena sent a voicemail message stating that I was insecure and said I was gross for rejecting a single dad. As I said, I have no problems with putting kids first. I just don\u2019t think, as a young adult, I want to live my life knowing that his ex would always come first.

I think I was just excited that he was the first man to ask me out. The first man who truly wanted to be with me, and I did not give myself time to think about how things could go wrong. I know that action would label me as an asshole because I was ready to go on a date because of my feelings, and I did not fully set David's feelings into the table. At first, I did not believe that I was the asshole, but when Selena called and said I rejected him because he was a single dad, it made me think. I know that there are other people who have ex's and they might still be close to them, but this one is different David has a bond with his ex-wife, something that I might never have with him. So, even if I initially, did not reject him for being a single dad.

Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have gone on the date at all. \n\nYou are young and in a different stage of your life. You just don\u2019t want to start a relationship with an instant family where the child (rightly) and ex (weirdly aside from functions as the mom) will come first. \n\nYou are allowed to want a different future for yourself. \n\nSelena is an AH. \n\nThe single dad is doing the best he can, but it sounds like his boundaries with his ex are nonexistent and that doesn\u2019t work for you. That\u2019s your prerogative.\n\nIncidentally, as great as it is to maintain a relationship with your child\u2019s other parent, it\u2019s pretty rude to take non emergency calls while you\u2019re on a date.", "NTA- There seems like a lot of drama already, and it\u2019s not worth getting into. You\u2019re only 24, there\u2019s no need to complicate your life with someone else\u2019s situation.", "NTA, I would be the same way and there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to be a priority. It\u2019s better to be upfront in the beginning rather get into a relationship so deep and can\u2019t find a way out.", "NTA - it\u2019s rude to take phone calls from friends during a date to listen to them vent about their problems. Because that\u2019s basically what happened here, even if it is an ex. I could understand him answering to initially see if it was about their kid but as soon as she started venting he should have mentioned it was a bad time and he would talk to her later.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s over her", "NTA\n\nI stopped dating men with kids because I have no desire to be a mom or a stepmom. So, no point in starting something that already has an expiration date, right? But, before I was one hundred percent about not dating fathers, I had a rule of *emergency communication only* during our time together. I ran into your scenario too many times, just nonsense about how they had to take the call or reply to the text because it's their kid's mom and they need to remain friendly. Sure, fine, but it's not unfriendly to quick-reply that you aren't available for the next three hours, or to give a heads up that unless it's an emergency, you won't be around to chat on Friday night. IDK what it is about divorced men who think that unless they stop on a dime for their ex, their kid will suffer for all eternity.", "NTA. Good on you for knowing your boundaries and what you don't want in a partner.", "NTA...\n\nThis is what happens with a lot of newly divorced fathers.  They're great guys but you will never be their first priority.\n\nI dated a guy for about a year.  He was newly divorced with three children and living with his dad.  I wasn't even his third priority.  I came after the dog.  Literally, he missed a date with me because his father's dog was ill.  He had missed dates before over his children's ball games (I asked if I could come and he said no) and once he took me book shopping for his ex-wife's birthday present.\n\nThe experience taught me that I wanted/deserved to be a higher priority.", "NTA there are several red flags \ud83d\udea9run.", "Absolutely NTA!\n\nChildren come first yes but next is your partner and his Ex is no longer his partner. \n\nEven if it wasn\u2019t as bad as it sounds(him being far too emotionally attached to an ex), you know your boundaries and put yourself first. You even put the child high on the priority list in this decision. You made a sound decision with impeccable reasoning.", "NTA\n\nHe's more interested in his ex's drama than he is in you. It doesn't matter if he says it's to preserve his co-parent relationship, it's not ok to do that to a new partner ever. Him doing it on the first date just means that you can pass before you get entangled.\n\nHe's 36 years old. I don't care that his ex was his high school sweetheart, he's old enough to know that you put your phone down on the first date. If you can't be bothered to engage with your date, why should they waste their time on you a second time?\n\nAnd Selena is so far out of line by inserting herself into a situation that doesn't involve her and insulting you that I would rethink that friendship.", "nta. You have the right to date who you want to do, Selena should keep her nose out of it  unless you asked her for advice. If it was me, I'd block both numbers.", "NTA. You\u2019re right, if the calls had been about his daughter it would have been one thing, but he isn\u2019t emotionally available for a relationship.", "NTA. You\u2019re just protecting yourself and the child. That\u2019s okay, don\u2019t let your friend make you feel bad <3", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely in the right to expect that any relationship you may have (first, second, twelfth, whatever) that your partner puts *you* first. Obviously with a single parent there are going to be times where they are going to put their **child** first, as they should, but it\u2019s totally wrong for them to expect you to basically share them and their time with the ex-partner. You can have a decent relationship with an ex, without the need to be IN their lives. Unfortunately for David, he has yet to realise this or have the balls toe force boundaries with his ex. \n\nTell Selena to go forth and multiply and that if she\u2019s happy to be a third wheel in a relationship then bully for her. You\u2019ve got more self respect than that.", "NTA I am guessing that Selena and you are similar age.  That would put this guy 12 years older than you, with a kid.  You have not had a serious relationship and he is divorced.  To many differences Tell Selena that you are looking for someone closer to your age as well as someone that does not spend the entire date talking to another woman on the phone while ignoring you.", "NTA. This is a fair boundary to have and something a lot of women would not put up with. There's nothing wrong with him having a good relationship with his ex but to the point where it interferes while on a date when you aren't even in a relationship wow. Sounds like he needs to set boundaries of his own otherwise he'll be single for a while. At least you were not putting up with it in hopes it may change", "NTA. You want balanced relationship with your own family as first priority. Your friend is TA for pushing you into dating with man who puts his ex first.", "NTA - You are wise beyond your years. Keep it up.", "NTA. You\u2019re a smart girl for knowing yourself well enough to know you can\u2019t navigate this relationship. Plenty of people have these boundaries. I am 43 (f) single no children and I don\u2019t want to date a single dad either. I chose not to have kids I also choose not to be a step mother", "NTA", "NTA you don't have to deal with that kind of baggage. You would not be the AH for saying no to All single parents.  There is no reason to settle like that", "NTA.\nIt\u2019s always bad form to make a first date about an ex; taking calls or texts just because your ex wants to vent? Super gross.\nHe can have a good relationship w his ex for his daughter and not make a date about the ex.\nWild your friend is upset at you!\nThe guy isn\u2019t in a space to be dating, he hasn\u2019t truly walked away from his previous life.", "NTA. He's taking long involved phone calls from his ex on your first date? He's got zero boundaries and limited social skills. You don't owe anyone a second date and you don't owe your friend anything regarding your decision to not date her brother.", "NTA.  You have to find a relationship that works for you.

His ex-wife will of course be in his life. They share a child together. But there\u2019s a difference between positive co-parenting, and stopping everything to address a none emergency for an ex. He doesn\u2019t need to cater to her in order to have a peaceful parenting relationship. This isn\u2019t about insecurity. It\u2019s about being inappropriate. If he isn\u2019t willing to live his life, then he\u2019s not ready for a relationship. Tell Selena she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about.

You can be a good parent by being on the same page about parenting, being civil with each other, and communicating positively with each other about the child and each other.

There's a lot going on here and it's no situation for someone who hasn't even had a chance to find out how various dynamics make them feel yet.

You didn't reject him for being a single dad, it was because of his actions. If you're not comfortable with his priorities, then you're not comfortable.

You don't need to subscribe to any of the single dad's issues. Not to mention, the creepy age gap. Single dad seems to want the best of both worlds-being close to his ex wife who can easily take care of the child and then there's you who can provide relationship benefits, extra childcare and sex for free. Single dad still seems to be attached to the ex wife and that's why he will always put her first. Good for you for running away. Single dad has no business dating to begin with since he clearly hasn't gotten over his ex wife.", "INFO - how did Selena get your number?", "NTA - You\u2019re not rejecting him for being a single dad. You\u2019re rejecting him because he isn\u2019t over his ex-wife. \n\nIf his continuing closeness to his ex is a dealbreaker for you then starting anything with this guy is a waste of time for both of you.

That and the MASSIVE age gap make him a red flag parade.\n\nThat he couldn't even put his phone on vibrate and call her back, or tell her he's busy, means his ex is either a raging psycho who will hold you both hostage, or he has zero boundaries and is this level of enmeshed and not over her as his own personal choice. That's not remaining \"friendly\".

You did chef's kiss great with this.", "NTA. But I would respond to Selena \u201cI did not reject a single dad. I rejected a dude that kept interrupting our 1st date to talk to his ex about her boyfriend. I have no issue with a man prioritizing his kid over me, I do however have a problem with a man dismissing me to talk to his ex about non kid related issues during a date.

David isn\u2019t in the emotional headspace where he\u2019s ready to put himself in the dating scene. What he wants is one sided emotional support while he plays happy family with his ex.

You\u2019re not passing David over because he has a kid, you\u2019re passing David over because he brings nothing to the table. That first date was a preview into your life with him. If you don\u2019t like what you see, run, don\u2019t walk.", "NTA - I'm a step-mum. I also have a kid of my own and another on the way as well. As a parent AND step-parent, let me tell you something - all of you on Reddit, actually, not just OP. Being a step-parent is one of the hardest things I have ever done in my life. You are expected to be a parent, but not too much of one, and when you cross a boundary - even an unestablished one - you are treated like the problem. You are expected to be perfect, always, and if you aren't, there will always be someone making a \"well, the evil step-parent story exists for a reason\" comment. You are under an insane amount of pressure to not just like, not just love, but *fawn* over a step-child. If you don't love them exactly the same as you would if they were your own kid who you carried and birthed and saw grow up, be prepared to have some big fights. And if you DO love them exactly as if they were yours, be prepared for other-parent drama. Because no one talks about it enough. But if you are LUCKY, the other bio-parent will tolerate or maybe even like you. If you are the average, they will despise you for having the audacity to be in their kids life, via loving their ex. If you are UNLUCKY, they will actively try to make your life hell and get rid of you.  No matter what the case may be, you will regularly feel like a third-wheel for a *while*. You will experience feeling othered in your relationship. You will have reasonable moments of jealousy or territorial-ness that will be treated as unacceptable by SOMEONE. \n\nAnd that's just the relationship with the kid. To be a step-parent, you need to accept that your partner will NEVER be out of communication with their ex. Never. Boundaries have to be set early and set HARD. \"No texting after 10pm unless it's about the child\" or \"no calling during date night\" or \"don't let your ex/baby mama/daddy use you as an emotional crutch through their own relationship drama\" seem like fairly reasonable and easy to follow rules, but you'd be AMAZED how many split parents find them to be wholly unreasonable. Unless you are particularly lucky, these issues persist and cause fights for years. They say they're just trying to be reasonable and a communicative co-parent, you say it makes you feel like your emotional boundaries don't matter, they make it about you not wanting what's best for the kid. I've seen it DOZENS of times, to dozens of step-parents.\n\nYou are 24. You've been a legal adult for, what, 6 years? 3 of which were in a pandemic? You have 3-4 years of reasonable adult life experience. It's entirely your choice if you want to date someone who is half-again your age, that's your business. I feel like people harp about age-gaps more than enough for you to make your own choice there. But you're ALSO allowed to choose if you want to step into a relationship with a pre-existing family dynamic, complete with child and a wife. Step-parenting and dating people with kids is NOT FOR EVERYONE. It is HARD. It can be great and wonderful, and at the same time it can SUCK. ESPECIALLY when stepping into a situation where the bio-parents have this type of friendship/relationship/codependency. You weren't able to have a single evening of his undivided attention when he was trying to actively impress you and show you what it is like to be his partner. Because he was too busy acting as a partner to his ex. \n\nFrankly, your friend can back the heck off. She has no right to be judgemental of you making the choice to not be second fiddle for the next decade or 5.", "Frankly respond to selena, yes im insecure, i know it, and that fact will be an issue with anyone as entangles in his past relationships as you brother seems to be. If course i would go out with him again if this wasnt the case, but i am insecure and inexperienced in these things, i know it will hit all my weak spots so i cut it off. Why waste everyones time. \n\nNTA", "NTA- you are actually being very responsible and it\u2019s best you know what you are comfortable with early on. Your friend needs to get over herself- it didn\u2019t work out and that\u2019s that.

That\u2019s a big situation to get into to date this guy. Also a call during a date? Kinda rude. \nBut you didn\u2019t reject a single dad either. You went on a date with him! You rejected a giant situation that felt uncomfortable.  Side not, though, you have every right to reject single dads too if that\u2019s not your thing. So Selena was wrong and being mean there.", "You\u2019re not rejecting a single dad, you\u2019re rejecting a man who won\u2019t move on from his ex wife. There\u2019s a big difference!", "NTA. Gosh, first of all... You are very smart and your decision not to date again was the right one and you know how you can confirm that? Just by seeing how her ex texts you (why the hell does she have your number) to get into your private life and insult you in the process.\n\nWTF? everything in itself is a red flag that you dodged. There are thousands of guys out there, you don't need to be anyone's second choice. You're smart for dodging this bullet. Block them both.", "NTA! That isn't a healthy relationship he has with his ex if she rings just to complain about her current spouse, uncaring of what he's doing. You're right, you wouldn't be having a relationship with a single dad, but also with this person who can't detach emotionally. The kid isn't the problem. Getting on well with a co-parent shouldn't involve that level of sharing.", "24 year old woman and your \u201cfriends\u201d are mad at you for not agreeing to date a 36 year old man who is clearly still wrapped up in his last relationship?\n\nNTA. It isn\u2019t 1920. Men aren\u2019t owed women\u2019s company.", "NTA. It sounds very messy and far from ideal for a first relationship.", "NTA even if he wants to be friendly with his ex, the appropriate response in that situation is to say he is busy and he'll get back to her... or not reply at all until later! Show your friend this... she is also in the wrong for calling insecure when your response was completely reasonable and mature.", "NTA. He stopped a date to hear the ex rant about her BF, no no no, you did the right thing.", "NTA. You decide what's good for you. And what is up with your friend Selena? She's more concerned about her brother being rejected than understating how you feel?", "NTA I was a single parent for 11 years and think you have more emotional maturity than most people on this subject.", "Personally I would take \"Selena sent a voicemail message stating that I was insecure and said I was gross for rejecting a single dad\" as confirmation of a bullet dodged and congratulate myself on good decision making. NTA.", "The red flags so far:\n\n\u2022talking to his ex on your date and it wasn't a kid related emergency.

If you choose not to date someone, for any reason, that\u2019s up to you. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound that at the moment you are compatible so not pursuing a relationship is sensible.

Have fun!", ">IDK what it is about divorced men who think that unless they stop on a dime for their ex, their kid will suffer for all eternity\n\nThese people are either co-dependent and not over their ex, or the ex truly is someone insane that will try to cut access to the kids at the slightest perceived grievance. \n\nEither way, you don't want to be involved with these situations.\n\nThere are plenty of single parents that have healthy boundaries with their ex.
