How are you supposed to know that your boyfriend was going to get there in that moment and how were you supposed to stop him?\n\nDealing with angry or jerky customers is one thing, but this guy assaulted you and anyone jumping in to help you is fine.

F that. If I saw someone assaulting my partner I would intervene no matter what. \n\nYou are not to blame for this man\u2019s behavior.
