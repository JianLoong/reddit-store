My dad has his own business, that was and still is very successful, while my mom was a SAHM. The money was good so she didn't have to work.\n\nShe eventually began to grow unhappy with the relationship and ultimately decided to divorce my dad and move out with us. \n\nEver since then every chance my mom gets she bad mouths my dad. For years I grew up thinking my dad was this evil person who had it out for my mom, when in reality that wasn't the truth. My dad is now remarried and is living a good life. He travels a lot with my step mom (they include my brother and I in the travels too) and my mom always has shit to talk about this. \"must be nice for your dad to travel as much as he does\", \"why does your dad get to travel and I don't\" etc etc. \n\nI have seen first hand for myself how my mom is a narcissist and has a major victim complex. She only cares about herself, and has shown me multiple times that she doesn't want what's best for me. \n\nEver since the divorce she has been living cheque to cheque. She cannot save money for the life of her. Prime example is when she was ranting to me about how she's in so much debt, and then a few days later came home with a brand new 75 inch tv. \n\nShe started drinking a lot since the divorce and as kids my brother and I saw and heard a lot of thing's that we didn't need to. Like her passed out on the kitchen floor presumably drunk, hearing her having you know what with her boyfriends etc. There were some mornings where she wouldn't even wake up in time to take my brother and I to school because she was drinking too much the night before.\n\nBut yet in front of the rest of our family she asks like she's \"mom of the year\"\n\nWe have a strained relationship as of now, and I am on the verge of moving in with my dad because I just cannot take her anymore. \n\nThe other day we were actually having a civilized conversation and she started bringing up my dad again bad mouthing him. She started going on a rant like she always does about how he's such a horrible guy, and how I apparently \"kiss his ass\", which is not true I just respect my dad. And how he gets to travel and has all this money and she doesn't. \n\nI was just at my wits end of hearing this for the 100th time. So I told her that maybe she should've rethought her decision of divorcing if this is how she feels since she brings this up all the time.\n\nShe got extremely offended and starting calling my an AH and a b\\*tch and told me to apologize.
