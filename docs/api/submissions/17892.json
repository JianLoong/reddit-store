He insisted that I stay at his house until I got my own house.\n\nDuring my stay, I helped with chores and paid for groceries. His wife (40F) and 11-year-old daughter were there, and the wife became overly reliant on me. She asked me to teach the daughter English and computer skills, do her homework, and assist with projects, despite my own work deadlines.\n\nEventually, I moved to my own house, but the wife keeps calling me for help with her daughter and sending the child to my house. The husband works remotely and is only home once a month. She often leaves the daughter with me for whole days when she wants to go out, interfering with my plans. \n\nI haven't had the freedom to travel or enjoy my time in the country due to this constant responsibility. It has been over 6 months since I arrived in this country, but I haven't had a break from them. This morning, when the wife called, referred to her 11-year-old daughter as mine and told me to pick her up, I got angry and refused, clarifying that I'm not her father.

You carried a load for them as a favor, but there's no agreement for this kind of continuing responsibility with their daughter and wife. By getting angry in this case seems like a reasonable reaction. Sounds like they're over-dependent on you and that's not okay. At least having set boundaries for your time now is a path to reclaiming it.", "NTA. Keep yourself away from them. This is utterly bizarre.", "NTA this is not normal and absolutely won't end well if you continue to go along with it.\n\nAlso wtf is that mom thinking? You're someone from another country she only recently met and she doesn't know you from Adam, but she leaves her child alone with you for days at a time? That's concerning.", "NTA. You already helped them a lot, there should be a limit at some point. Their daughter is not your responsibility. It\u2019s okay to help whenever it suits you, but they should not make this a habit.", "NTA but 1.you shouldn't be doing the kids homework for her and 2. Its time to get your own place.", "You need set some hard boundaries. Consider saying, \u201cI can\u2019t today.\u201d Or \u201c I will be working tonight/have major work deadlines.\u201d  \n\nDon\u2019t explain. Then don\u2019t answer the door or respond to messages. Book a trip and then leave without telling them. \n\nStart creating some distance from them and decrease or cut off your communication too. \n\nNTA but you may need to become one to regain your own independence. The entire situation is very concerning.", "NTA\n\nTime to cut ties with these people. You're being used.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I sympathize with the woman's need for help, but it's exhausting to care for her child. The kid occasionally misbehaves, and also asks too many questions. Preparing kid-friendly meals adds to the burden.", "I agree with your point. It was irresponsible for them to judge me based on assumptions and leave their child with me. If I were a parent, I wouldn't do the same. To clarify, while there were many consecutive days when the child was with me from early morning until night, I would send her back home when the mom returned at night.", "Thank you. Just to clarify, I have already been living in a different place.

This behaviour is not okay. You don't have to be in the middle of this. You should enforce strong boundaries and you definitely don't need to watch her daughter overnight!

You may need to explore the cultural norms of this country in order to have a more fruitful conversation about your discomfort with this level of reliance.

In both our countries, it is highly unusual to demand or expect such things from even close friends, let alone someone you've just met. Also, it is generally deemed inappropriate to leave a girl child in the care of an adult male who is a stranger. While it's understandable that she may be facing challenges, I don't believe it is my responsibility to constantly assist her.
