You carried a load for them as a favor, but there's no agreement for this kind of continuing responsibility with their daughter and wife. By getting angry in this case seems like a reasonable reaction. Sounds like they're over-dependent on you and that's not okay. At least having set boundaries for your time now is a path to reclaiming it.", "NTA. Keep yourself away from them. This is utterly bizarre.", "NTA this is not normal and absolutely won't end well if you continue to go along with it.\n\nAlso wtf is that mom thinking? You're someone from another country she only recently met and she doesn't know you from Adam, but she leaves her child alone with you for days at a time? That's concerning.", "NTA. You already helped them a lot, there should be a limit at some point. Their daughter is not your responsibility. It\u2019s okay to help whenever it suits you, but they should not make this a habit.", "NTA but 1.you shouldn't be doing the kids homework for her and 2.

I sympathize with the woman's need for help, but it's exhausting to care for her child. The kid occasionally misbehaves, and also asks too many questions. Preparing kid-friendly meals adds to the burden.", "I agree with your point. It was irresponsible for them to judge me based on assumptions and leave their child with me. If I were a parent, I wouldn't do the same. To clarify, while there were many consecutive days when the child was with me from early morning until night, I would send her back home when the mom returned at night.", "Thank you. Just to clarify, I have already been living in a different place.

Stay away. They\u2019ll get as much \u2018help\u2019 from you as possible and a single no will offset the relationship cause they don\u2019t see a value in it without transactions. \n\nYou don\u2019t need this OP.

In both our countries, it is highly unusual to demand or expect such things from even close friends, let alone someone you've just met. Also, it is generally deemed inappropriate to leave a girl child in the care of an adult male who is a stranger. While it's understandable that she may be facing challenges, I don't believe it is my responsibility to constantly assist her.

I wonder if your friend pitched you as more of an au pair to this family without telling you.", "Lol a tiny little lady us harassing you bc of your inability to say no. Grow a pair !

Did it ever occur to you to just handle this like an adult?", "What kind of absolute moron deals with this for months", "NTA. I would actually go no contact and if she just shows up just say you have other commitments.", "NTA. You know some people will take over all your free time if they can get away with it. I don't think your needs are being thought of at all. Nip it in the bud. Good luck!", "Apologies for the confusion. I meant to say that the husband works in a distant location from home.", "Ahh I understand, thanks for the clarification! Working in a remote location rather than attending work remotely (I.e. from home). \n\nJust wanted to clarify because if the husband worked virtually but was never home that would add a whole other layer to the strangeness of this situation (and the AH-ness of their actions).\n\nYou\u2019re NTA by the way but I hope that\u2019s abundantly clear by now!", "NTA. It\u2019s an unfair and unhealthy dynamic! You were right to assert yourself (finally!) and set a boundary. That is not your child. You moved away. She was never your responsibility, and it is creepy and weird to be expected to care for someone for days. The husband should be more present or involved.

This constant pressure and her refusal to give up eventually led to my outburst.", "You need to stop this, because as long as you allow it, she will continue to walk over you.  As you probably know by now. You should stop taking her calls and don't open the door when she comes knocking. If need be, find a new flat and change your phone number.

If you let this woman steam roll you for that long, you may seriously need some professional help in learning assertiveness and boundary setting. You do not need anyone to \"accept\" your refusal!
