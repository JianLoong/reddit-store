You already are giving her a discount. Brand new it's $450, so $60 is a steal. We don't owe anyone anything for free, so she seems entitled.", "INFO \n\nMy curiosity is piqued by your last sentence. Is the reason you don\u2019t want to give it because your MIL watches her kids but not yours? \n\nI smell resentment.\n\nAlso: I just checked marketplace and there\u2019s some mamaroos for $50 in my area. (Edit: there\u2019s also one for $28)", "NAH. You're allowed to sell it if you want to. Gifts don't mean they have no financial value to you in the long run or that you have to give it away for free when you're done with it.\n\nHowever, I would give it to my sister in a heartbeat and it's a little odd to me that you are comparing your costs to hers when deciding if you should give it or not. It would be the *kind* thing to do. It seems like maybe there's something deeper here?", "How bad do you need 60 bucks? Sounds like unnecessary drama when you could help family.", "Info: how badly do you need the 60/120? How bad are your finances?\n\nWithout any edits, you were given a gift by your grandmother in law, and after 2 kids using and abusing the item, you want to make a profit instead of just giving it to your SIL?", "NTA. \n\nYou are offering to sell it to her for far less than you could get. \n\nPeople feel like they should get things for free all the time.  But even if it was a gift, and you need the money, she shouldn't expect you to lose out on that money.", "YTA\n\nTO be fair, it is yours and you can do with it as you please.  But, family typically helps family if they're able.  It's not uncommon to give unused and outgrown baby items to family.  You're under no obligation to help, but it is generally seen as the nice thing to do.\n\nBut it's your last sentence that seals it for me.  This isn't about the money.  You're just salty that MIL watches your niece while you have to pay daycare.  So you're trying to hurt them the only way you can.  That's what makes you an asshole.", "Why do you get to veto your wife on a gift from her grandmother? \n\nWhy do you think you can get that much for it anyway?\n\nWhy not let her use it and then sell it when she\u2019s done?\n\nYTA for doing on this hill", "YTA. Why do you have the final say on what happens to a gift from your wife's grandmother? If she wants to give it to her sister, it's her right. Plus, I'm sure you'd spend way more than $60 on other gifts for your SIL's baby. So it would be better to just give this to her for free.", "Is it one of the mama Roos that\u2019s been discontinued cause babies died in it? I\u2019m about to put one out to the curb but plan to break it first so nobody will pick it up.", "YTA - It came from your wife's side of the family. The (great) grandmother has now passed and it would be nice to keep this piece in the family. It didn't cost you anything. And in the grand scheme of things what you are asking for from your SIL is not even 10% of your daycare cost for one week. Your wife obviously thinks that you should just give it to her sister as well or she wouldn't be in a mood. And honestly I'm caught up on this one line:\n\n>(with her money anyway as she had dementia) \n\nDoes that mean that grandma didn't really know what was going on but someone used grandma's money to buy it? Because if that's the case then I would say even more so that it needs to go to the sister.", "YTA - your wife is fine giving it away, so you\u2019re choosing to fight with your wife and SIL over $60.", "You're kinda TA.\n\nIt was gifted from her side of the family. It's used now and her side of the family could use it. Why not re-gift it instead of causing family drama.", "YTA. A quick Facebook marketplace search returned a dozen of these things for $50-70. It seems unlikely you\u2019ll get $120, so you\u2019re basically holding it hostage when your SIL could use it. While it\u2019s always nice to get money for things when we can, is it really worth it for the $50-70 you might actually get to destroy the relationship?", "Are you so hard up that all this ill will is worth $60?\n\nYTA", "YTA 100% \n\nIt was gifted for free from her side of the family and it would nice to be passed down in that side of the family.", "NTA.", "Kinda leaning YTA, if you can afford $30k a year just in daycare I can't imagine $60 is a lifechanging amount of money for you, or $120 for that matter. Given that your wife is also pissed at you for not just giving it to her sister I have to imagine she doesn't feel like you really need the money either. You got it for free, if you don't really need the money just give it to your wife's sister for free. I get why she's pissed at you.\n\nEdit: not to mention, you even make note to point out that it was *gifted* to you by *her grandmother* and you want to charge her to keep it in the family? Kinda fucked up.\n\nEdit2: actually the more I think of it, not really even your choice. Your wife's grandmother gifted it, your wife wants to give it to her sister. Sounds like this has become none of your business.", "YTA if you\u2019d blow up a relationship for $120, which is peanuts compared to how long you\u2019re going to have to live with the consequences of being stingy towards your wife\u2019s family.", "NTA, you gave the family discount already. When you have something for sale and someone comes and demands it for free (essentially what she has done by throwing a tantrum that you want paid for it) they become the rude one. Keep it up for sale and get full price. Once it was given to you, regardless of who the gifter was, it became yours to do with as you please. People seem to have forgotten that in this entitlement surge we're in.", "YTA\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t get why your wife even asked you\u2026 the gift came from her side of the family.. are you willing to make this a thing over 60$ ? \n\n\nWhy don\u2019t you just give it to her, and tell her when she\u2019s done give back then you can sell it..\nYou have two kids.. you know how fast kids grow out of things.", "YTA what does her childcare have to do with it? You haven't been successful in selling it for 2 months, just do the kind thing and give it to your family member. Jeez.", "YTA. It was gifted to you and now you are trying to make a buck off if it. It is a family member who is asking to use it not a stranger. Let your SIL use it and ask her to return it when she is done. Then you can sell it.  \n\nAlso daycare costs and free daycare have nothing to do with this.", "YTA - over $60 that you might not even make if you can even sell it on market place.", "Kinda yta\n\nYour wifes grandmother gifted her/you this bassinet\n\nYou dont need it anymore but her grandmothers other great grandchild could use it. And you want to make a buck off it\u2026.", "Nta. You are under no obligation to give away items. My family and I share baby stuff and pass it along whenever the next person has a baby. It's a great system if everyone is willing to participate. However it isn't demanded or expected, it's just a kind act we all started doing. If you need the money then sell it.", "NTA you\u2019re already giving her a discount", "NTA. Your property, your choice. I would never expect someone to give me something for free regardless of how I\u2019m related to that person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They also didn't pay for it. The SIL's grandmother paid for it and it would be going to another great grandchild's of her.

In my area the swings are 50, but I found the bassinets for 280 and 300...", "He\u2019s never going to get 120$ for it. That\u2019s way overpriced. He should honestly just gift it to the sister in law as something nice to do for family.", "It sounds like there\u2019s some major resentment and spite going on", "It sounds like the sister already gets free stuff from other family members.

Kids things are expensive. Sometimes selling what they grow out of is the best way to replace items.", "In my area they range from $35 to $70. OP is 100% TA in this. Just pass it down to the family and stop being resentful. It\u2019s her family anyway, if I was her I would just give it away and tell you to kick rocks.", "I think this kind of the point.

Just that brand new they're $450.  It's their bassinet to dispose how however they want because it's THEIRS. Who originally paid for it and how much is irrelevant.\n\nBeing greedy would be selling it almost full price new, not giving someone a discount  of a discount.

It was second-hand, and it lasted through 3 kids!  She paid $250 for it!\n\nThese things are worth their weight in gold and worth every used penny.  $120 is a freaking STEAL!!!", "Good point! I was just curious as to what it was.", ">He should honestly just gift it to the sister in law as something nice to do for family.\n\nThat's definitely what I would do, but it still doesn't mean OPs the asshole here.", "Well yeah. Someone is asking for OP's property for free instead of paying half of what they are asking. And they got MAD that they were offered a discount!\n\nThat bit of information they added at the end was to show that the SIL was saving money with childcare compared to OP, but still wants it for free and gets mad when she doesn't get her way.", "That's what I got from that too", "This isn't like a family heirloom.  It was a gift to THEIR child.  He has as much ownership as she does.  \n\nSome of you are really weird about what side of the family a gift came from.", "He does, once it was given to them, it was his and his wife's to do with as they want. Who it was gifted from became irrelevant once it was delivered. Only someone with an entitled gift grab would keep track of who gave what at a baby shower so many years ago.\n\nETA, once delivered, a thank you card to grandma was all that was owed.", "Not weird at all, it\u2019s just clear she\u2019s got some attachment to it and she wants to hand it down within her family. Those appear to be her feelings, not mine. That should be enough for him to let go of a potential $60. She\u2019s his wife and she\u2019s got feelings. $60 shouldn\u2019t be life changing enough for him to step on the sentimental attachment his wife happens to have with regard to this item that was given by her recently deceased grandmother. Her feelings are valid, whether any of us agree with them or not. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s asking him to \u201cgive it away\u201d to a stranger.", "So his wife\u2019s sentimental feelings over the item are null and void because his 50% of this takes precedence over that? That\u2019s pretty shitty thinking on your part. She exists, she has feelings, they matter, he does not come first. I don\u2019t think anyone is owed anything but it sounds as though his wife has strong feelings about this so his want for money should not come before his wife\u2019s feelings.", "And what? OP and wife paying $590 a week ($ 2556.67 a month, $30,680 a year) while SIL gets free daycare doesn't factor into your judgement either? Pretty shitty of you too.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 You act like you know the context of that situation, that of which was not provided by OP and doesn\u2019t need to be provided because it\u2019s not relevant to how he has described his wife\u2019s feelings to be.", "You're the one hung up on the wife's emotions, not me. We don't know if the wife is upset because it was given by the grandmother, or simply because she's the one getting crap from her family **because it isn't in the post**.
