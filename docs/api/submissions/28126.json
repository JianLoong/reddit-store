Honestly iI don\u2019t have trust issues we go have drinks hang hang out with friends separately all the time and In two years it\u2019s never been an issue, it felt like too sketchy of a situation tonight and I hate trying to control a situation but It wasn\u2019t a risk I was comfortable with, at the end of the day she is her own person and could have gone out if she wanted but I\u2019m really happy she didn\u2019t", "created_utc": 1696317866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ylajl/aita_didnt_want_girlfriend_to_grab_drinks_with/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She openly told me one of them was flirting with her and it makes me a little worried that they are famous musicians.

You made an assessment of the situation and the risk was too high. The same thing that a bodyguard would\u2019ve done. You didn\u2019t stop or control her because of a lack of trust. You only told her that you felt uncomfortable with the situation because of the flirting and unknown male intentions. What you did came from a place of love and concern for her well being.

It is your call if you accept this bullshit or not.\n\nIt is basically not acceptable behavior when she indicated that he flirted with her and that she then wants grab drinks with them. \n\nShe was  fishing your response, which should have been along the lines of \"okay\". Her behavior afterwards is what you should look at, the options are:\n\n1. She did not go and have drinks with them. She will tell you it did not feel right. It means she tested you on your insecurities and you passed the test. Best case\n2. She did go with them and did not cheat. This is not good, while you passed the test, she obviously knows this is a shitty thing to do but does not care about your feelings. \n3. She cheated on you. \n\nAnything but 1 is girlfriend/wife material, except for the shit testing. I am happily married but would never have accepted that kind of insincere bullshit.

Option 3 is an insta dump.", "NAH if you only said you were uncomfortable rather than insisting she didn't go.\n\nBear in mind, she was notifying you what she was doing, not sneaking around.

But you mentioned they were famous. Some things to consider is when she Said the person was flirting with her. Was it a brag? Was it a this is making her uncomfortable?  Was it to make you jealous? Or her being transparent?  Like that sets a mind set for this whole thing. ALSO is she the type of person to have a celebrity \"list\" like a free pass if so and so offered to sleep with them they would? If so its a personality indicator as well.  Ultimately you're in a tough spot because you call it insecurities but it could be a guiding gut feeling as well.  Best thing to do is CALMLY explain why you feel how you feel and see if she accepts and grows with you or rejects and dismisses your view. A good partner will WITHIN REASON understand and simply not put you in that position. For example it could have been yes ill go for drinks let me invite my boyfriend he'd live to meet you guys... imo nta  I assume it happened though how did it all play out?", "How is it a different situation? I missed the difference between her grabbing drinks with the band and you grabbing drinks with co workers.\n\nAren\u2019t you both still grabbing drinks with a few people?", "NAH. She genuinely may have believed that it would be an innocent outing for drinks with the band but that's hardly the case. I've read about A LOT of crazy sh- regarding bands and what they do/how they treat girls. It's. absolute. bonkers. When it comes to bands and girls, don't ever trust that it's going to end up all clean innocent and whatnot. Your gf may be going into it expecting that it stays PG-13 but then face a situation that's hard to escape from.", "You basically told her that you think there is a chance she is going to sleep with someone else. You're letting your insecurity get in the way of her living her life. Doubtful she will put up with many more incidents like that.", "YTA - she can do what she wants, if you get insecure because she\u2019s having drinks with guys, that\u2019s a you thing.
