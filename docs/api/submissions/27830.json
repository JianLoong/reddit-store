It's not your fault that your partner is an AH and toxic that you should stop attending the gym that you enjoy. She needs to take a good look at herself and ask why she is so toxic, and a bully.

If they have kids with a toxic partner,  fear of losing custody can make a person feel trapped. Or maybe they are the product of a toxic marriage and they have no frame of reference to realize that they are with a shiity partner, they think it's normal or even good \"because at least they treat me better than my mom/dad treated their partner\".\n\nThen there are really sad situations where a genuinely good partner can become toxic after years or even decades of being with someone. By then you're deeply in love and you've never imagined that you could leave this person. It's hard to walk away from that. \n\nPoint is,  it's not always as simple as not stating with people who are shitty", "I climbed for 3 years and am on a hiatus but I thought the same, was insane to me to read its a climbing gym", "There is a reason why people say love is blind", "Yeah, getting trapped in a situation due to kids and economics are pretty common, sadly.
