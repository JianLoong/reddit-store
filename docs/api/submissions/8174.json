The silverware comment \ud83d\ude06 I would have called their bluff, they can\u2019t make you pay for a fee they didn\u2019t disclose. Police would have laughed in their faces and left. I hope you didn\u2019t leave a tip.", "NTA. Just take it out of the tip since your waitress didn't inform you about it ahead of time, and since it's the easiest way to keep your 8%.", "I really think that the silverware thing was a joke! \ud83d\ude02", "Pay.\n\nDispute charge (just the difference) with explanation. \n\nYou'll get credited the disputed amount.", "Pay the 8% and don't leave a tip.", "NTA for the refusing to pay portion of the tale. \n\nI\u2019m hoping most of the commenters saying YTA are saying it based on that silverware comment, because if they\u2019re fine with the hidden fees not disclosed until the bill comes then yikes - that sets a horrible precedent. \n\nI would agree that you suck for taking the silverware but meh.", "That comment even: https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/10js4hk/well_this_is_a_new_one_out_there_3_charge/j5mfuu0?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3", "When I was (I\u2019m a little better off now) I used to steal silverware from chain restaurants so I could have silverware of my own. I only stole four of all types forks ect. But I did it because I was taken out by family and could only afford ramen by myself. \n\nTo add, my family sucks and would never help me only brag about taking me to a restaurant once a blue moon.", "Wait... Is OP implying that they took ALL the silverware?  without getting caught?  or like at their table?  I want to know how much they are claiming they took.", ">What is a dining fee anyway? \n\nMany cities have passed laws that extra taxes have to be added onto bills at restaurants of a certain size in order to support worker health insurance, for example. So it could be something like that...", "If they have a sign disclosing it (even if they hadn\u2019t yet put it up), it\u2019s a good chance it is not customary or it is legally required.", "Meals Tax is a very real thing.", "Seriously, as someone who worked in the industry, it's.... really not a big deal", "I fail to see how these posts are related outside of bullshit fees tacked on to a bill. Different percent amounts for starters plus this OP mention putting the silverware in their purse leading me to believe this op is a she not a he. There are certainly more than one restaurant out there who would try shit like this.", "Be... Our... Theft!", "It\u2019s a good thing all the astronauts\u2019 food comes mushed up in those squeeze bulbs, because I stole the silverware from the spaceship, too.", "If I recall correctly it can be considered as misrepresentation by the restaurant for failing to disclose before hand.", "Doesn\u2019t work like that.", "You literally committed a crime. Pay it and blast them on various review sites or take em to court. I hope they go after you for the theft of their property.", "it wasn\u2019t come out of our pockets \ud83e\udd23", "Comment of the year. \ud83e\udd43 \ud83e\udd47", "I have only not tipped like 2 times out of probably a thousand times eating out and this would definitely have been a no tip situation for me, if the server was actually being snotty about the 8% fee.", "Nah, OP just forgot to wear a sign saying if she\u2019s seated at a restaurant she\u2019s entitled to their silverware.", "Or just as easily they say \"just remove the surcharge\".\n\nWhy is everyone making out the easiest thing is to make them pay the full amount?", "Seriously, it's still getting used so it's better than when servers would straight up throw them away out of laziness lol", "I was just thinking about the DC sub. They've even got a Google list of restaurants in the area doing this. It's gotten out of hand.", ">Not tipping the server stealing the silverware harms the server who did nothing wrong.\n\nholy shit i dream of the day when the toxic american tipping culture fucking dies, jesus", "I agree that it affects the server. If it happens to the server often enough, they'll start making sure they disclose it while ordering, not when bringing the bill. They'll also put pressure on their employer that the practice is costing then money, and can find a service job like that almost anywhere else at any time. They'll start leaving if the business policy is costing them money.", "Yes, it may hurt the server, but I wouldn't say she did nothing wrong. \n\nPlus, maybe it would motivate that worker to find a job where her tips aren't being hurt by a business decision that the restaurant made. Ultimately, the restaurant will find that they can't find help any more.\n\nOf course, then the restaurant would probably just complain \"no one wants to work anymore\" and not take responsibility for their poor business practices.", "Not saying it was right at all. I have to wonder since this restaurant started this extra charge, she and the rest of the wait staff are probably hassled by at least one customer each shift. Thinking of some kid just trying to save for university or rent. Again, rolling your eyes and attitude won\u2019t get you anywhere. That can\u2019t happen. \nMy first job I had a guy yell at me over a penny. (Tax on one item was some price and if he bought 2 he was charged an extra cent. I said, I could put them through separately if he wanted. He kept yelling it wasn\u2019t the point. I did my best to be accommodate him but nothing was good enough. Never would I roll my eyes. Not cool.)", "Restaurants buy silverware in bulk. The silverware OP stole was likely not even worth a dollar", "They willingly participated in an illegal scheme defrauding their customers.  Doesn't seem so fair or square to me.", "You do have to pay to be in a restaurant. Do you often loiter in restaurants, refusing the buy things and stealing silverware?", "Classic reddit", "It's like a 1 out of 10 for wrongness lol. Probably right above jaywalking", "Plus it seems the waitress had some attitude about the whole thing. \n\nTipping has become a sort of moral leverage that restaurants have over their customers now. If we don't tip despite a bad experience, apparently that makes us all assholes. \n\nWell...why? If I had a bad experience at your restaurant regardless of who caused it (within reason: I'm not going to refuse to tip because a baby was crying at a nearby table), why should I give you more money than the absolute minimum required of me?", "I'm not even sure why this was downvoted. Why are we in this weird position of having to protect servers at all costs? They were given the opportunity to not have to work at below minimum wage and they all fought against it because they thought they could live off big tips. If a weird 8% fee shows up on my bill that nobody told me was going to be there, the server is not getting a tip because that's a sh*tty practice. These fees on top of gratuity are getting out of hand.", "The OP sounds like a nightmare so that may be why the eye rolling.", "Whoa, that's insane. The reason that the lunch prices are lower is usually because you get less food...", "I'm pretty sure they were just trying to rip off some high school kids"]}
