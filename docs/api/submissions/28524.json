If he refuses to help put her to bed (or do any parenting it sounds like) then he doesn\u2019t get a say. If he has such an issue with it, then he can start putting her to bed. When we weaned my oldest from BFing to sleep, we actually had my husband take over the bedtime routine to do this, and it worked like a charm!", "NTA. You're trying to do what is right for your child in a difficult situation, and there is always going to be a difficult period of adjustment when trying to change habits.  \nI would try talking to your husband again when everyone's emotions are a bit calmer. If he's not around for much of the time then there will be a lot of things he doesn't understand about what you're going through, and good communication is always key to avoiding arguments in a relationship.", "NTA- wheb. I sleep trained my daughter it\nHard hard but she responds. Just do it\nEveryone wins eventually..", "NTA. You are doing the right thing, and have the paediatrician\u2019s blessing.", "NTA", "NAH", "NTA - but sometimes it can help to empathise with what the other person is feeling. \n\nNot because you agree with their opinion & plan to do something different - but just acknowledging how they are feeling can calm things down. \n\nFor example, you could have said: yeah, I know, isn\u2019t it super stressful to listen to her cry. I find it hard too. But the doctor says this is the Best Thing & also we will need to sometimes hear her cry about things and still make good parenting choices. So it\u2019s good practice for that. But **yes, I agree with you, it\u2019s soooo hard to listen to her cry even when** we know we are making good parenting decisions for her. \n\nYou can use the same technique in a few years with your daughter. \n\nFor example - she sees a toy in the shop that she Really Must Have. But it\u2019s not in your budget today so you say \u201cno\u201d. And she starts showing signs of getting upset. \n\nSome parents just get \u201cstrict\u201d and try to boss her out of being upset. Which never works! (Does it work for you, being told to \u201cstop being upset, right now!\u201d\u2026?). \n\nAnother option is to agree with her *underlying emotion* (while not changing your decision or action): oh I know, doesn\u2019t that toy look like fun. I can see why you like it. Shall we take a photo of it and add it to your (stupidly long & far in the future) Christmas list? \n\nYou can agree with the emotion, without changing your behaviour. \n\nWorks for all humans - adults and children.  \n\nIt probably works on you too, if you think about it. We just like to feel understood.", "Is a pacifier or binky out of the question?\n\nLike, let baby suck on something until falling asleep then take it away?\n\nMay help with the transference.", "If he wants to feed her then get him some formula and he can do it. I hate it when the non default parents wants to give advice but not help in the situation.", "Dad here. I work from home and so I took an active role in raising our kids. It was really long (worked full time during the day and then took over most of the parenting duties afterwards so my wife could get a break), but it allowed us to plan out parenting stuff together.\n\nSleep training was definitely difficult - it makes you feel like a terrible parent knowing that you COULD make the kid stop crying but that it would ultimately make it harder for the child if they don't sleep train. So yeah, my wife and I would sit in my office next door to the nursery or lay in bed and listen to the child scream and cry for 10 minutes and we'd feel like crap but we'd support each other because we knew the goal.\n\nAnd once the kid got it, everybody was happier.\n\nThis won't be the last time that you have tough times like this and your husband needs to get on board with what you're trying to do and he needs to understand it's not going to be pleasant for the parents or easy. \n\nThe worst thing you can do as a parent is give in and give your kids whatever they want in order to make them keep quiet, so he's suggesting something that will only make the crying worse.\n\nIf he doesn't want to endure the screaming, he can leave the house but he really should be supporting you and realizing that it's not easy for you to endure.\n\nNTA", "It's a cultural thing, isn't it?  My DIL is from Central America and she breastfeeds her children until at least 2.  I breastfed my own son until he decided he would rather walk around than nurse (around 1 years).  \n\nAs far as your anxiety,do you pump breast milk so someone else can give her a bottle? \n\nIt sounds like in your culture the woman does 99% of the child care.  I don't know what to tell you about that because I suspect your husband isn't going to change.", "NTA. You look after the child and do everything for the child, and seeing a paediatrician.  A child needs to be trained, just like a husband needs to be trained to help out with looking after kids, household etc. It will be difficult at first, but will work out later. Your husband done his job by contributing his one sperm so NTA for telling him to FO!", "NTA. Notice how your ILs aren\u2019t complaining? Because they\u2019ve done this before - they\u2019ve probably sleep trained your husband when he was baby. He can get over it. It\u2019s called being a parent, something he hasn\u2019t been doing since his child was born.", "Dude seems like an AH...the baby's 11 months old and husband \"barely knows how to change a diaper\" and is \"mostly controlling\"? Sounds like an AH to me.", "Meant NTA", "As a parent that has slept trained all our kids it really is worth it at the end. both parents have good sleep and kids are well rested.\n\nhave you read the book 'Save our sleep' by Tizzie Hall ? didn't follow to exact tee but this book saved my sleep lol\n\nNTA by the way but i think you need to clearly state to your husband that he needs to support you on this cos the easy option is to feed which is short term but your goal long term is to teach your child the skill of self settling and no longer relying on a parent rocking them to sleep etc.\n\nDoes your child have a comforter? Do they sleep in their own room ( im assuming No as your staying with your in-laws) ?", "There are some valid reasons to critique sleep training at that age, but I doubt that was your husband\u2019s intention. \n\nI had a question though. Did you explain to him what you were doing and the background including the pediatrician consultation? If not then maybe you are being too harsh if you literally told him to \u201cfuck off.\u201d", "NTA. If it\u2019s ok you can introduce a binky? Maybe just the sucking motion will soothe her. I also want to say 11 months teeth can come (if not impacting already) so she will be extra fussy anyways. Introduce the routine and if you\u2019re ok to train your husband, ask him to share some parenting responsibilities too. He will appreciate your efforts more! I get it you\u2019re in a traditional house but it\u2019s 2023. Your child should grow up with todays thoughts process not from yesteryear. \n\nSab theek hoga.", "NTA. While the first few days are hard, once they are trained, it\u2019s such a load off! I did it with all my kids and being from an Asian household, had to hear a lot of shit. But I kept at it. Now the same people talk about how great my kids are \ud83d\ude44\n\nBut this sounds like a bigger problem. I think you need to have a discussion with your husband about how childcare/parenting is being handled. He won\u2019t bond with his own kid at this rate. My in-laws always tried to butt in saying their son doesn\u2019t need to change diapers and things because my MIL can help. I said absolutely not! If he can have a child with someone, he should be able to change a diaper. He eventually got used to bathing and feeding them and the bond they have is amazing to see. But it doesn\u2019t happen if the father doesn\u2019t get actively involved.", "NTA. You gotta do what works for you if you are the one putting her to sleep each night. I work nights so my hubby and I switch and we both do what is necessary for us to get our son to bed.", "NTA. Continue to sleep train. Stop explaining to husband. He gets it. He wants things to be easy for himself despite what it does to you. Ignore him.", "NTA\n\nThink about yourself: how frustrating would it be to wake up in the night and have to yell and wait for someone to come in and tuck you in a very specific way or feed you or do anything just so you could go back to sleep? It would SUCK. As an infant who can barely communicate their needs directly, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s even worse. You\u2019re doing her a favour and he needs to see it that way.\n\nThat being said, it is usually EXCEPTIONALLY easier to sleep train if the person tending to/rocking the baby isnt the mom who smells like milk. Any chance he\u2019d try rocking her or laying her down and sitting with her until she sleeps? It would likely go faster.", "Nope you are NTAH", "NTA. I have a 17 month old and my husband is south Asian and even though I am not, I understand how he was raised and how his parents were arranged all that jazz so I understand your perspective. I am mostly the caregiver for our child simply because that is what works for us (my husband does other things).\n\nAs a mom, I wouldn\u2019t even call cutting the feed to sleep habit sleep training. It is a good habit to break bc your baby is going to start eating primarily food soon so you\u2019re gonna have to do this soon anyway. It just takes time. Every time you adjust your baby\u2019s routine, it\u2019s going to be tough for a little bit. But you have to remember to stay strong and consistent. Since your husband doesn\u2019t have much to do with you child\u2019s routine, you need to remind him that this is what needs to happen. If he wants a say in what\u2019s going on, he needs to participate more. That\u2019s all there is to it.", "NTA\n\nAnd this is coming from a mom who still nurses and co-sleeps with a toddler who will literally be 3 in a couple weeks.\n\nThis is what is best for me because I get more sleep this way. You gotta do what is best for YOU and your child. Both matter.", "NTA. Whichever parent has the responsibility of attending to the baby through most of the night has the say in how and when baby should be sleep trained.", "Nta. Sleep training saved my life. My son also needed to nurse to fall asleep and would wake up every 45 minutes to an hour to nurse. I was losing my mind and was having very intrusive thoughts about hurting myself. The exhaustion was like nothing I had ever experienced. Finally at 14 months I sleep trained him and I haven\u2019t looked back. It was tough the first few days but totally worth it. I got a lot of judgment from family for it but my child is better off with a healthy mother that\u2019s alive.", "NTA", "NTA. You currently know what's better for your daughter.", "NTA - \"I'm following the doctors directions, put on some headphones or go for a walk\" repeated as frequently as needed.", "NTA. Yes it is very stressful to hear your baby cry (no parent wants to hear/see their child cry), but your husband needs to grow a backbone and support your decision to train your child to sleep independently (you have sought professional help after all). This method, however painful, is better for your child who won't become dependent on the bottle every time she goes to sleep.", "You wouldn't be the asshole if you'd said and did a whole lot more girl...damn...sometimes I feel like im reading someone's diary on here...like ppl trying to convince themselves that things aren't as bad as they are or that you actually enjoy things while questioningthemselves :'( for an outsiders perspective id say you need rescued", "NTA. If your husband is so incompetent, he doesn't get input in this. Let him be offended, he needs to back off and let you follow the advice you've been given from a professional.", "NTA", "YTA. I very much struggle when one parent \u201cclaims\u201d all rights to child rearing.\nI was a SAHM for 12 years, and my husband was an equal parent.", "NTA, you were cleared by the doctor. May want to invest in some decent earplugs for you and your husband though.", "Ask your husband to get noise cancelling headphones, also get white noise machine for your daughter and maybe a pacifier or something else that might help her self soothe. \n\nNTA", "Husband needs to step up. In a healthy relationship it\u2019s not normal for one partner to do all the chores on top of working and parenting. And it\u2019s certainly bonkers to not know what to do with your own child.", "NTA but this reads like a reason to not do arranged marriages.", "i wouldnt trust him not to nurture this dependance tbh...", "That advice is sound, very helpful and infuriating at the same time. Flipping the patriarchy. \n\nHere you go honey, a man gave us this advice. You don't accept a woman (EXPERT because main caregiver!) 's judgment / decision but surely this expert-but-stranger knows best?\n\nI think you're absolutely right @violavetch75 I bet this would work.", "Excellent advice! I wish that I had known about noise cancelling headphones.", "i am trying to make my daughter take the pacifier but she would take it for a bit and then spit it out. \nher nap today was soo much better though. doc said it would take a day or two to minimise the crying and he wasn\u2019t wrong.", "Ok but hers clearly isn\u2019t he isn\u2019t even an equal partner", "Regardless of bottle or breast, an 11 month old does not need to be eating to go to sleep. It's not a good sleep habit for a baby her age."]}
