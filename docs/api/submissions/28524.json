HOWEVER, let me share this husband life hack: find some links to articles that explain exactly what you are doing, how the technique.

If he refuses to help put her to bed (or do any parenting it sounds like) then he doesn\u2019t get a say. If he has such an issue with it, then he can start putting her to bed. When we weaned my oldest from BFing to sleep, we actually had my husband take over the bedtime routine to do this, and it worked like a charm!", "NTA. You're trying to do what is right for your child in a difficult situation, and there is always going to be a difficult period of adjustment when trying to change habits.  \nI would try talking to your husband again when everyone's emotions are a bit calmer. If he's not around for much of the time then there will be a lot of things he doesn't understand about what you're going through, and good communication is always key to avoiding arguments in a relationship.", "NTA- wheb. I sleep trained my daughter it\nHard hard but she responds. Just do it\nEveryone wins eventually..", "NTA. You are doing the right thing, and have the paediatrician\u2019s blessing.", "NTA", "NAH", "NTA - but sometimes it can help to empathise with what the other person is feeling. \n\nNot because you agree with their opinion & plan to do something different - but just acknowledging how they are feeling can calm things down. \n\nFor example, you could have said: yeah, I know, isn\u2019t it super stressful to listen to her cry. I find it hard too. But the doctor says this is the Best Thing & also we will need to sometimes hear her cry about things and still make good parenting choices. So it\u2019s good practice for that. But **yes, I agree with you, it\u2019s soooo hard to listen to her cry even when** we know we are making good parenting decisions for her. \n\nYou can use the same technique in a few years with your daughter. \n\nFor example - she sees a toy in the shop that she Really Must Have. But it\u2019s not in your budget today so you say \u201cno\u201d. And she starts showing signs of getting upset. \n\nSome parents just get \u201cstrict\u201d and try to boss her out of being upset. Which never works! (Does it work for you, being told to \u201cstop being upset, right now!\u201d\u2026?). \n\nAnother option is to agree with her *underlying emotion* (while not changing your decision or action): oh I know, doesn\u2019t that toy look like fun. I can see why you like it. Shall we take a photo of it and add it to your (stupidly long & far in the future) Christmas list? \n\nYou can agree with the emotion, without changing your behaviour. \n\nWorks for all humans - adults and children.  \n\nIt probably works on you too, if you think about it. We just like to feel understood.", "Is a pacifier or binky out of the question?\n\nLike, let baby suck on something until falling asleep then take it away?\n\nMay help with the transference.", "If he wants to feed her then get him some formula and he can do it. I hate it when the non default parents wants to give advice but not help in the situation.", "Dad here. I work from home and so I took an active role in raising our kids. It was really long (worked full time during the day and then took over most of the parenting duties afterwards so my wife could get a break), but it allowed us to plan out parenting stuff together.\n\nSleep training was definitely difficult - it makes you feel like a terrible parent knowing that you COULD make the kid stop crying but that it would ultimately make it harder for the child if they don't sleep train. So yeah, my wife and I would sit in my office next door to the nursery or lay in bed and listen to the child scream and cry for 10 minutes and we'd feel like crap but we'd support each other because we knew the goal.\n\nAnd once the kid got it, everybody was happier.\n\nThis won't be the last time that you have tough times like this and your husband needs to get on board with what you're trying to do and he needs to understand it's not going to be pleasant for the parents or easy. \n\nThe worst thing you can do as a parent is give in and give your kids whatever they want in order to make them keep quiet, so he's suggesting something that will only make the crying worse.\n\nIf he doesn't want to endure the screaming, he can leave the house but he really should be supporting you and realizing that it's not easy for you to endure.\n\nNTA", "It's a cultural thing, isn't it?  My DIL is from Central America and she breastfeeds her children until at least 2.  I breastfed my own son until he decided he would rather walk around than nurse (around 1 years).  \n\nAs far as your anxiety,do you pump breast milk so someone else can give her a bottle? \n\nIt sounds like in your culture the woman does 99% of the child care.  I don't know what to tell you about that because I suspect your husband isn't going to change.", "NTA. You look after the child and do everything for the child, and seeing a paediatrician.  A child needs to be trained, just like a husband needs to be trained to help out with looking after kids, household etc. It will be difficult at first, but will work out later. Your husband done his job by contributing his one sperm so NTA for telling him to FO!", "NTA. Notice how your ILs aren\u2019t complaining? Because they\u2019ve done this before - they\u2019ve probably sleep trained your husband when he was baby. He can get over it. It\u2019s called being a parent, something he hasn\u2019t been doing since his child was born.", "Dude seems like an AH...the baby's 11 months old and husband \"barely knows how to change a diaper\" and is \"mostly controlling\"?
