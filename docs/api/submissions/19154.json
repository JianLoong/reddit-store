Literally wtf is wrong with people?!", "He's settling for an older woman who is still 20 years younger than him!", "I didn\u2019t even notice that part\u2026he\u2019s a huge creep.", "My ex's father was a slumlord and I used to make extra cash cleaning apartments when tenants vacated. \n\nOnce I caught him staring at my ass while I was cleaning an oven. I was 19 and thoroughly repulsed.", "Well I see why he\u2019s an ex lol", "The first thing my ex-MIL said to me was that I needed to have a breast reduction. That was 24 years ago, and I\u2019m still a little salty that I didn\u2019t think to say \u201cyour son seems pretty happy with them just as they are.\u201d \ud83d\ude44", "Imagine marrying a man who said in public that he had to settle for downgrading to be with you and saw nothing wrong with that statement. \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22", "I agree. Weird situation, made far weirder by OP's dad. He's certainly not selling anyone on the relationship.", "Agree. It\u2019s the comments. \n\nBut the parents should consider how others will react, especially if OP and their spouse want to have kids. \n\nIn the story *I* know, two people my age got married and so did their divorced mom and dad (making them step bro and sis after they were already married with 4 daughters). \n\nThe family is also SUPER religious and where I\u2019m from that\u2019s really not the norm and is seen as kinda creepy/weird. \n\nAlso, step bro and sis\u2019s parents dated FOREVER\u2026they went to school together. I guess they assumed their parents wouldn\u2019t get married? \n\nThey came out as a couple. Two years later their mom and dad got married. It was weird. And for multiple reasons, including the fact that they spent their teen years living in the same home and then got married and immediately started pumping out kids (they have 6 now, and I\u2019m from a very blue state where people don\u2019t practice that quiverfull shit). \n\nAnyhow, this just reminded me of that. \n\nAlso the mom used to be sane and was my babysitter once upon a time. Now she thinks Reki will infest you with demons. Lol. She used to be a NP.", "It's not genetically gross because sure, no relation, but seems a bit.. callous? On one hand, the parents don't need anyone's permission to marry but also perhaps consider how uncomfortable their relationship might make their children and future grandchildren feel. I've only done one family tree once for school and don't think they're a common exercise anymore but that would have made it awkward for sure. \n\nDad's comment also makes you wonder.. did he only choose his fiancee because he is in fact attracted to OP's wife? Gross if so and I feel terrible for Jenny's mom if that's the case.", "That\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 - I knew a couple whose parents married right after they did. It\u2019s not that weird. But your dad is just gross.", "Nah, got to disagree. At 50 you\u2019re still generally active, enjoying life and looking at another 10-15 years in the workforce. At 70, you\u2019re generally retired and at least starting to experience some of the diseases of old age. If you\u2019re 50 and marry a 70 year old you\u2019re likely to be dealing with widowhood before you even retire - or with a spouse that needs high levels of care before that. \n\nPlus they\u2019re old enough to be your parent, which is creepy at any age. I\u2019m rapidly headed towards 50 and I would no way date a 70 year old and would think it completely inappropriate and creepy if one asked me out", "How old are you, though? Bc I'm 43, which I feel is 48-adjacent, and a 68yo (or 63 or whatever) could NOT get it. All the \ud83e\udd2e. I feel like we give a pass to old people, but she's 48. She is NOT old enough for that shit.", "70 is valid in context of calling 50 old  and creeping on a 30 year old.", "Look, it's a baaaaaaaad situation.", "Random, but when I was little, my cousin and I bought our moms matching magnets. They were shaped like sheep and said \"ewes my best mom.\" 6 year old us found that peak humor.", "Divide by two. Add seven.", "Well OP's father pretty much admitted that he actually wanted to bang his son's wife but had to \"downgrade\" to the mother.", "Have you ever heard of an inappropriate joke?", "My adoptive father said the saaaame thing to me when I was in college. He has known me since I was four and used to give me my baths and showers. It's just about the worst thing you could ever hear in your life. Here, have a trauma fist-bump.", "In the lobby of hell", "Well, it seems quite possible that he already set the precedent when he married OP's Mom - given that OP is 29, she was probably about the same age as Jenny's Mom, which would suggest a 40-something yo American man marrying a 20-something Korean woman.\n\nThe comment about wishing he'd met OP's GF earlier suggests he'd prefer a 20-something yo version again.", "Yikes. I hope you've left them in the dust.", "Talk about low self esteem.", "See, now that\u2019s just a whole other host of problems. The parents having a pre existing relationship, the kids living together as children before getting married\u2026 there\u2019s so much wrong with that that I don\u2019t see happening in this situation.", "Yeah I think the way the parents are handling it is the real issue. I guess the family tree thing doesn\u2019t really bother me. Again, no blood relations and I don\u2019t quite frankly care what people think about me on the day to day, but the comments from OP\u2019s dad are making a weird situation awkward and creepy. \n\nThis could have been a cute and romantic \u201cwe met because you met, and it was fate!\u201d situation. Instead it turned into \u201cwow, your wife is hot. Her mom is pretty fine too, though a bit worse for wear. I\u2019m gonna sleep with her mom and pretend it\u2019s her.\u201d", "That\u2019s called a nurse and a purse.", "Yeah, sure, it might matter to you personally. But a 50 year old woman isn't going to be easily manipulated and controlled by a 70 year old man, which is the reason why people find age gaps creepy in the first place. If they both love each other and the 50 year old is wiling to make sacrifices to be with the 70 year old, that's her business, not ours. Plus, it does pass the standard \"half your age + seven\" rule by eight years.\n\nI would also add that I know highly active 70 year olds who are in much better physical shape than some 50 year olds I know. They could have plenty in common, and it sounds like they do. I mean, she should dump him anyway because he's an absolute creep, but it has nothing to do with their age gap.", "I met a guy who was 10 yrs older and had just retired. He'd been married twice, both times to younger women; we met on a package tour and while he was nice enough to chat with, he was inappropriate in ways he had no idea.\n\nI had a knee injury so carried aleve and a prescription anti-inflammatory. I mentioned meds at some point and he demanded to know what type, then went on about his ex being an addict.\n\nWhich is all well and good but nothing to do with me as my meds were nothing to do with him.\n\nI didn\u2019t remain in contact due to controlling vibes.", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re talking about just attraction, just that there isn\u2019t the weird power dynamic that there usually use when we talk about younger age gap relationships.", "No they were saying dad's girlfriend cuz it's followed by daughter in law", "Nope, he meant the new one and he could have had his DIL. I need a shower to get the skeeve off me!", "6 year old me would totally have high-five\u2019d you.", "I think a lot of the people here are reading way too much into this joke. It's clearly more a joke about how he's dating her mom and not because he wants to bang his daughter in law.", "That sounds like it feels just so incredibly violating. I\u2019m writhing in my skin at the thought, I can\u2019t imagine actually experiencing that", "Omg, I am so sorry this happened to you.\n\ud83d\ude14", "Where he stubs both of his toes on each of the several seats. \ud83d\udc7f", "If Op is 29, and his dad is 68, that means OP's dad was 39 when OP was born.  Jenny's mom (MIL) would have been 19 when OP and Jenny were both born. So Jenny's mom (MIL) was definitely a young mom. OP's mom could have believably been in her early to mid-30s when she gave birth to OP, especially if OP has older siblings. But you could be onto something- I am no stranger to the ol' 90 Day Fianc\u00e9", "They were at the daughter's baby shower when he said this", ">Also, I know 70 year olds who are in much better physical shape than some 50 year olds.\n\nI came here to say exactly this. My stepfather is about to turn 80 and he still works a full time 40hr a week job. Not because he needs the money but because he needs to stay active. People constantly think he is in his early to mid 60's and refuse to believe him when he says he is going to be 80.", "Sylvester Stallone is 76 . J/s", "This exactly.", "That type of guy doesn't change. He likely thinks he's got the upper hand due to age.", "Ehhh, the older one is still probably more financially stable. Especially if it's male vs.female.", "Okay on mobile and it's being stupid about linking the comment but we are replying to the top comment where they say that the Dad is hitting on OP's girlfriend", "So men Should just never date women then, because they statistically make more money. Or should you only ever date people who many exactly the same amount as you?your take is idiotic at best.", "Ok, calm down and go to bed, buddy", "Lmao what? My leap in logic is nothing compared to what you did. I\u2019ll give you credit, it was at least impressive."]}
