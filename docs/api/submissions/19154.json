At Jenny\u2019s baby shower our parents told us they were getting married and my dad made a joke about how me and Jenny would now be step siblings. I was disgusted by how my dad thought this was funny but what made me angry was when he said he is sad he didn\u2019t meet my wife sooner and had to downgrade to an older model.

But him making the \"Older Model\" joke was very disrespectful to both your wife and her mother. \n\nNTA.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\n\nAre the relatives aware of what he said? And the deeper implications of what he said?

While it's rare for the parents of an adult couple to discover a connection themselves, it's not strange or inappropriate.  Father's comments, however, were both. \n\nBut after that I'm having to go ESH because the father is an AH.  And the son, while not an AH, also sucks because he can't handle his temper.  You OP, a 29 year old guy, can't figure out how to deal with a rude house-guest without screaming?", "NTA.  His comments were odd, weird and gross", "ESH:   You and your dad. I think everyone is handling why your dad is an asshole. \n\nBut I think most people are missing the fact that after your dad made his \"joke\". You yelled at yo7r future MIL and kicked her out also, and now you and your fianc\u00e9e are not talking to her either (when sounds like she said nothing wrong)\n\nThis kinda shows this isn't about what he said.", "NTA that's a really gross way to talk about his girlfriend's child. As if he was hitting on your girlfriend. Gross", "NTA.\n\nThe step-sibling comment was a strange joke, but... 'older model'? Absolutely disgusting comment. I probably would have slapped him once I got over the shock, so props to you for not doing that.", "That his dad basically said he would have hit on op wife if she wasnt married to him?", "are you insane?", "They been married for five years. She already his mil. But soon to be stepmom\u2026.\n\nDoesnt sound like the mom stood up for that disgusting \u201cjoke\u201d. Plus who could be with someone who stated they are physically attractive to their daughter. Regardless that their daughter is an adult", "And really rude to her mother, why would you even want to be with someone who would talk about you like that?\n\nOP is definitely NTA", "so OP can marry who he wants. but his dad can't? is that what you're saying?", "OP said he snapped and started screaming at both parents. Sounds like there wasn't time for her to stand up to him. \n\nAlso think if the many women with asshole partners.  Do they really deserve being yelled at by a man due to their partner actions? Especially when what was said was an insult towards them", "Fuck yeah in this case", "The mom sucks to marry her daughter husband dad. Regardless or not she ah for that.\n\nPlus it sounds like she still with them. Its in that person if they continue to be with someone who does ah behavior to their family", "im sorry. but unrelated by blood.", "I wouldn't say that make her an AH. Is it weird, yes. But to say someone an AH for falling in love with their child's partner parent is a stretch.  \n\nBecause what's that saying is that she's an asshole for not putting her child feelings over her own. What if it was the other way around and these two adult children fell in love can the parents call them assholes. Doubtful.", "so if they have kids and their parents have kids\u2026. you think that\u2019s gonna feel normal for them? they\u2019d share blood siblings. while being married to each other.", "so what you're saying is. only OP happiness is important. it doesn't matter what an old ass man wants. screw his feelings. thats basically what you're saying."]}
