As many parents can attest, being new parents is a lot of work and between our jobs and parenting, we haven't really had time to spend with just ourselves.\n\nFortunately for us, my mother came over last week to stay with us for a month and she offered to watch our baby for the whole day so that my husband and I could just go out and enjoy ourselves. We were walking to a restaurant in a suburban area when we got lost. So my husband whipped out his phone to find the directions.\n\nAbout 2 minutes later, a young woman in about her early 20s approached us and asked if we could pretend to be her friends since there was a man following and catcalling her for about 5-10 minutes. She was very scared. There were people walking around so my husband asked her what did he look like. She said he was white and was wearing a black overcoat. We looked up and saw this creepy looking man in his 40s or 50s about 15 yards away. My husband asked him if he was harassing this woman. The man said he just wants her number. I looked at my husband he just had the most angry face I had ever seen. He started walking towards this man. My husband is lean but he isn't overly muscular so I don't know if he planned on getting into a fight, but the man quickly turned around and started running away.\n\nMy husband returned and offered to accompany this young woman to a more crowded area, which was she was grateful for. After dinner, I asked my husband what he was planning on doing to the man if he went up to him. My husband said he didn't know but was contemplating getting into a fight. I told him it was stupid of him to do that because he could have had a weapon on him. He said he would do it again and thought about how our daughter could likely find herself in that same situation when she's older. I told him I appreciate and admire his courage and his desire to keep this young woman safe but I think we could have helped her by pretending to be her friends as she asked instead of risking physical confrontation. My husband says he wanted to scare him into not doing this shit again. My friends are telling me I should be proud of my husband for what he did but I think it was foolish of him to potentially risk his life when we could have gone with a safer option.

Yes. Badass and heroic and admirable? Also yes. I get your worry, but you should be proud of him. He got genuinely angry at a guy being a creeper to a stranger. That's a rare trait. NAH.", "NAH. He did something somewhat foolish, sure. But it was well-intentioned and to the benefit of another human who needed help. That\u2019s admirable.\n\nYou were scared, because you love him.\n\nI\u2019d encourage you to reframe the story from being about what he did as being foolish/irresponsible to about how you responded strongly to him because you care and were worried. \n\nI\u2019m sure he\u2019d understand!\n\nYou all sound like two nice, decent people. Good luck!", "NAH. I've been where you are. My husband has stepped in to defend a stranger more than once. It's hard to watch someone I love so much put himself in danger. Your instincts are telling you to stop him, in order to keep him safe. I had to accept that this was something he has to do. It's not in him to let this go, and the world needs people like that. I love him in part because he's that kind of person. Find a way to make peace with it if you can.", "YTA for criticizing him. Most predators, like this guy, will run off 99% of the time. They harass women because no one stands up to them. You should have approached it a different way because clearly you are concerned about his safety. You should have done the compliment sandwich feedback. \u201cI am proud you stood up to that guy. It frightened me to think what could have happened to our daughter, if that guy had a gun and decided to shoot us. May be next time, we should get the person to safety and call the police.\u201d", "Soft YTA - your concern for his safety is valid. His choice was rash and potentially ill-advised however, it was admirable. He showed a lot of bravery in standing up for that young woman. I wish a lot more men were like him.", "nta. your husband was just trying to protect someone in need and that's commendable. while it's important to prioritize safety his intentions were pure and he successfully scared off the potential predator. it's understandable that you were concerned but sometimes taking a stand against harassment is necessary to create a safer environment for everyone.", "I wish more men acted like your husband. While I get your concern, shouldn\u2019t you also be proud that your husband is willing to do the right thing?", "This isnt a typical YTA/NTA, most people don\u2019t have an ounce of morality or bravery in their soft bones and would fold in a situation like your husband was in. Nothing wrong with you wanting your husband to be safe. Your husband is a badass at the same time nothing wrong with you being worried with what could\u2019ve happened. Such is life. Dad instincts kicking in wanting to destroy a lowlife creep.", "your husband's actions were incredibly brave and admirable. standing up against potential predators takes a lot of courage and it shows that he truly cares about the safety of others. your concerns about his safety are valid but sometimes taking risks is necessary to protect those in vulnerable situations. nta", "YTA.  Your husband did the right thing, and you are being selfish.  Society would be better if there were more men like you husband.", "NTA it was great that he stood up for her, but as you said there were safer ways to protect her and he didn\u2019t have to escalate it at that point in time. \n\nOnce you have a baby you can\u2019t just think of what you\u2019re willing to personally risk in these situations, as you\u2019re also risking leaving your child without a parent.", "Buckle up Buttercup. If that story gets around to single (or otherwise available) women you socialize with, I predict they will have a somewhat different take on it than you do. He will be admired by other men and desirable to women. Lots of men shrink back when faced with a real confrontation. He did not. If you keep this judgemental and dimissive attitude up with respect to his stepping up, he will potentially find a more receptive audience elsewhere.", "nta - your husband showed bravery and a commendable desire to protect someone who was in need. it's understandable that you were concerned for his safety but sometimes people are willing to take risks to stand up against harassment and ensure the safety of others. kudos to your husband for his actions!", "nta your husband did the right thing by standing up for that young woman. it's important to address potential predators and make it clear that their behavior is not acceptable. while there may have been alternative ways to handle the situation his intentions were to protect and scare off the man not necessarily engage in physical violence. safety should always be the priority but sometimes taking a stand is necessary.", "NAH\n\nI get your worry, but if we don\u2019t confront people like this due to risk aversion, then, IMO, they are repeatedly being told what they do is (at least a little bit) ok. And, it's not. \n\nAll 100% my opinion of course. Signed 58M fwiw", "NTA. But you were mistaken in criticizing his behavior.", "Your husband could have saved that girl's life and I hope that someone will do the same for your daughter one day.  The man ran because your husband confronted him and ONLY because of that. He stopped her from an assault or worse. You should have had his back and taken video of the guy too. That's not the only woman he's followed and frightened. \n\nI understand your concern, but you three were safe together. NAH.", "NTA what your husband did was unnecessary and extremely foolish.", "I assume you also don't like the fact he votes Conservative too and doesn't drink soy", "nta - your husband's actions may have been bold but they were brave. he instinctively stood up for someone in need and showed courage in the face of potential danger. while it's important to prioritize personal safety sometimes taking a stand against harassment can make a significant impact. it's understandable that you were concerned but ultimately your husband's intentions were admirable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
