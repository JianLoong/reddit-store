As many parents can attest, being new parents is a lot of work and between our jobs and parenting, we haven't really had time to spend with just ourselves.\n\nFortunately for us, my mother came over last week to stay with us for a month and she offered to watch our baby for the whole day so that my husband and I could just go out and enjoy ourselves. We were walking to a restaurant in a suburban area when we got lost. So my husband whipped out his phone to find the directions.\n\nAbout 2 minutes later, a young woman in about her early 20s approached us and asked if we could pretend to be her friends since there was a man following and catcalling her for about 5-10 minutes. She was very scared. There were people walking around so my husband asked her what did he look like. She said he was white and was wearing a black overcoat. We looked up and saw this creepy looking man in his 40s or 50s about 15 yards away. My husband asked him if he was harassing this woman. The man said he just wants her number. I looked at my husband he just had the most angry face I had ever seen. He started walking towards this man. My husband is lean but he isn't overly muscular so I don't know if he planned on getting into a fight, but the man quickly turned around and started running away.\n\nMy husband returned and offered to accompany this young woman to a more crowded area, which was she was grateful for. After dinner, I asked my husband what he was planning on doing to the man if he went up to him. My husband said he didn't know but was contemplating getting into a fight. I told him it was stupid of him to do that because he could have had a weapon on him. He said he would do it again and thought about how our daughter could likely find herself in that same situation when she's older. I told him I appreciate and admire his courage and his desire to keep this young woman safe but I think we could have helped her by pretending to be her friends as she asked instead of risking physical confrontation. My husband says he wanted to scare him into not doing this shit again. My friends are telling me I should be proud of my husband for what he did but I think it was foolish of him to potentially risk his life when we could have gone with a safer option.

That's why he didn't need to do anything though. The predator wasn't going to do anything while he was there. Needlessly escalating things is stupid and puts yourself and other people there in unnecessary danger.\n\nActing tough when it isn't smart to do so is cringey.", "Are you in America? sure, people can find ways to have weapons anywhere, but we have a real problem here with our guns and weapons. \n\nJust this month a woman was shot and killed in a road rage incident near my house. People get road rage and kill each other here. \n\nI seriously doubt your husband's actions permanently stopped thr creep, made him rethink his life, and swear never to harass a woman again. \n\nBut, what it did do, is risk your 9 month old baby not having a dad to raise her.\n\nLook, even outside of America, if someone throws a punch and the other person falls and dies by hitting their head on the concrete curb - the person who threw the punch is going to prison for causing the death.\n\nThis may be a hot take and I may get flamed for it but the best thing your husband could have done was be an ally. \n\n\"Hey Sis I've missed you! Let's go grab some food.\" And then walked with her to a safe place.", "NTA. I applaud both of you for helping this young woman, but starting an angry confrontation isn't the way to go.  The creep targeted her because she was all alone.  Acting like she is your close friend or relative, smiling, calling her by name, etc was probably enough to discourage the creep.  Your husband could also calmly and kindly approach the creep and ask him why he is following \"my sister\", \"my sister finds your behavior inappropriate and so do I.  Thanks for understanding a leaving my sister alone\". A man telling the creep he is related to the target (even if the relationship is a lie) is enough to discourage many creeps. \n\nMy next door neighbor helped me out a few years ago.  My name and  photo were in the newspaper, and some old guy found my number and left a message about how he wanted me to know how pretty thinks I am and other nice, weirdly inappropriate stuff.  My neighbor called him, was nice and friendly, kept calling me \"My wife Lindylady\".  \"My wife Lindylady said you left a message, my wife Lindylady asked me to return the call, my wife Lindylady found your message a lille disturbing and so do I, my wife Lindylady doesn't want to talk to you\" etc.  My neighbor is a great guy!", "NAH it was foolish for the exact reason you said but it was the right thing to do. pretending to be her friends isn't really a deterrent unless the friends are willing to stand up for her physically right? So it ends the same way he just acted first. \n\nGood work to your man. Maybe he should have a weapon of his own in the future to ensure the playing field is level.", "Nah because I wish more creeps got a beating. On the other hand he escalated the situation for the young woman too. Who knows if this guy knows her route or something. What if he finds her again and your husband isn't there?", "Vigilantism is such an interesting topic...\n\nThere are plenty of ethical arguments working in your husband's favor. His actions may have helped prevent other women from being harassed by that man that night. He may help \u2013 in some small way \u2013 to normalize and incentivize more people to fight against harassment, which would have a net positive for society. Had he gotten into a fight, one could argue that any injuries he caused would be a just form of retribution for frightening that woman. Etc. And there's just something that feels inherently heroic about his actions. Just pretending to be friends wouldn't have all of these benefits.\n\nBut you're right that there was significant risk. And had he been injured, arrested, sued, or (less likely) killed, it  wouldn't just harm him, but it would also affect his wife, his newborn baby, and his wider family and friends. So, he put others at risk \u2013 especially you and your daughter \u2013 who may not have wanted to sign up for super-hero duties. Plus, there are plenty of good arguments against creating violence in public, as it's possibly bad for society to normalize solving problems that way.\n\nMy heart is with your hubby, and my head is with you. So, I'm going to cop out and say NAH. I think you're justified in being annoyed at your hubby for putting your family at risk. But I hope a part of you is also quite proud of him for being willing to fight for a just cause. Sometimes heroes have to break rules, take risks, and be a little foolish to make the world a better place.", "Soft YTA. It's understandably you have concerns about safety, but if your daughter ever gets in a situation like that you will wish that there was someone to do what your husband did.", "NAH but....Ask yourself this. If your daughter is in that situation in 15 years, would you want someone to defend her and scare off a creep that was following her?  I bet you would....

One of which would be to get your phone out and start recording and loudly state 'are you following this poor woman?' or similar so there's both evidence and something to scare him off. \n\nI come from a background where I had to have some idea how to handle a confrontation, and your husband did the incorrect thing. This creeper could indeed have had a knife, or beat your husband in an altercation. But I think on this occasion, it's better just to admire his- admittedly unwise- bravery and be blad it worked out well instead.

He has a new baby and wife that he is responsible for, not a strange woman that subconsciously his lizard brain was trying to impress regardless of why he said he did it. He put himself, you, and the other at risk. He is the AH", "That was not smart. The girl was safe with you. Just leave.", "A qualified NTA... your feelings are valid, but misguided. Your husband was doing precisely what men get asked to do now, he was a man with privilege standing up to another man with privilege and making him back off from harassing someone.\n\nYou can voice your concern without criticising him for standing up to a predator.\n\nThink about it this way, put yourself in the other person's shoes, would you want someone else's husband to stand up against a preditor to protect you, or would you like them to take the \"not involved\" path and tread more softly.", "Very very gentle YTA, because we're all different but if my man did that I'd want to rush home and jump his bones \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NAH.

He was actively protective and in showing that creep his behaviour was not ok, and not going to be tolerated \n\nBravo to him", "NAH.  You are rightfully concerned about his safety in a situation like that, he actually cares and gives a damn about a complete stranger and that should never be discouraged.  Pretending to be her friends may not have been enough, as who are determined enough to follow in a situation like that.  Again while it's incredibly risky, a creep is more likely to flee and stay away when actually confronted.  No one is an AH but your husband did the right thing and you shouldn't discourage that ultimately.  Also, while to you and your family your husband's life is more important than the stranger young lady, in the grand scheme of things no one's life is no one's life is more important than anyone else's.  Had your husband not done that her family could be grieving the loss of their loved one.", "NAH, honestly. You're not wrong for pointing out the obvious risk, but a guy who stands up to a creep is not wrong either. If there were more men like your husband out there, I'd probably feel safer in public too.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" My husband said he didn't know but was contemplating getting into a fight.

And you should be concerned, too - he is willing to put hios anger into fhysically assaulting someone - make sure, YOU never anger him. And reconsider having kids with that AH.", "Nah commend him but ask him to not repeat vthe Performance of confronting someone when another peaceful solution is available as you and your daughter need him to be alive and well", "Why didn't you whip out your phone and take his picture then send it to the local police?   Or just take it and tell him you were sending it and his location to the police with a text about him following the girl?  Way back in the dark ages, that was one of the big selling points for cell phones with cameras - women could take the creep's picture and immediately duck into a place of business to send for help.  \n\nConfrontation is dangerous; I applaud your husband's intent, but there were safer ways to handle it.  NTA", "Sooo. As women we are asking men to stand up to other men and call them out for being creeps but you're telling him not to? It's really his choice and if he Celt comfortable doing it, let him. \n\nThe pretending to be friends thing works great for just us gals because there's power in numbers and whatnot but it doesn't teach the creepy fuckers anything. It just shows them 'wait till she's alone'. Having someone confront your creepy as behaviour shows 'no you did not just get away with that and get to slink away unscathed'", "Wait, OP you're telling me that the creepy guy was wearing a overcoat AND your husband was so imposing that this creeper just straight ran away.  That dude was clearly a paid actor your husband planted.  haha.", "NAH but I'd be proud to stand next to your husband.", "You should have taken a picture of the dude first", "A friend of a friend was killed confronting a guy like that outside a bar (I didn'tknow him personally, my friend played in a band with him).  The abusive guy didn't even have a weapon, he just suckered punched the good guy and he hit his head on the curb.  You absolutely can get killed in these situations. Get her away, pretend to know her sure, but maybe don't directly confront the guy.", "OP has a rare man for sure.", "Agree. Most people would've ignored the poor girl or just filmed her plight. He took action. Good for him.", "OP you have a new kid. We men have hormonal changes with a new child coming along and we have a strong \u201cprotect\u201d driver that kicks in. You may also notice him getting agitated when the baby cries for a bit. This is also a biological driver to see to the babies needs and our stress levels get high (mums do too). \n\nMany guys would have done the same thing in the same way, and this kind of behaviour of the creep can get us furious, but his rational and logical processes were over-ridden by these instincts and actions in the moment. It\u2019s our version of \u201cbaby-brain\u201d.", "yeah like, Op's husband did a really nice thing, but he also risked his life, in front of his wife, with a newborn at home, when he could have helped the stranger without endangering himself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome reaction from her side is totally understandable.", "Definitely agree that OP should reframe this with her husband.\n\nThis could also be a bit of a gender divide. Obviously, it is different for everyone but in general, society tends to encourage men towards confrontation (not necessarily aggressive) in these situations, whereas women tend to be taught to find non-confrontational solutions to potentially threatening situations involving men.\n\nOP, perhaps you and your husband could discuss a compromise for if a similar situation is to arise in future. For example, taking a self-defence course that addresses how to react to an armed attacker. You could also both research or take a course on how to assess threat levels for potential attackers. Most importantly, you could figure out a keyword or way to communicate if one of you notices a weapon/threat or feels that it is safe to confront the perpetrator.\n\nGood luck to you two and much appreciation to both of you for helping this woman out of a dangerous situation.", "Yup. I wish more men would start to take care of their body, getting some muscles and working on their self-defence and attack skills. A small, thin guy wouldn't have the ability to do that.\n\nEdit: Downvoters kinda prove that they wouldn't ever step up themselves but just expects others to do so, as it shows a lack of understanding the actual situations in which we expect men to interrupt sexual harassment.", "Dude shes right if he had a weapon it could of ended badly", "This.\n\nThe \u201cpretend friend\u201d tactic only really works in heavily crowded areas where the creep won\u2019t be able to easily push past other people in order to follow you without making it seem like their actions are purposeful/getting pushed back and held up. It\u2019s also not really a viable solution if no one is willing to play the role of your \u201cfriend\u201d either and accompany you to a safe spot where the creep may be reluctant to go in case they get caught.\n\nEven if you do find an unexpected buddy, that\u2019s not going to stop a creep who is determined to get you from just waiting until everyone else goes home before approaching you again or just knocking your buddy to the ground before grabbing you. Intimidation tactics are risky because you never know whether the response you get is fight or flight, but it gets them off your back and makes you less of an appealing target during future encounters. Creeps look for people who they think will be too scared to do anything by themselves or who have friends that look like they\u2019ll be easy to take on. They\u2019ll often scatter very quickly when they realise that\u2019s not the case or if they\u2019re outnumbered.", ">What if he finds her again and your husband isn't there?\n\nThen he'll at least know that there are some people out there who won't put up with his shit, and you can't tell who they are just by looking. And that there can be consequences.", "As the OP pointed out, it would have been much safer to just stick to helping her remove herself from the situation. People getting killed in this sort of scenario isn't uncommon, does he want to even stay around to see his daughter grow up?", "The tragedy is that people don\u2019t really care about the scenarios that don\u2019t affect their lives.\n\nShe would want someone to defend her and would be less understanding if someone wouldn\u2019t defend her or her child because it would affect her. Since it doesn\u2019t and this girl is a stranger she doesn\u2019t care about her safety just the potential danger to her via her husband.\n\nMen like the one following her are cowards who are afraid to stand up to another male when challenged which is why he ran.", "Men should take care of their body, grow some muscles and pursue a self-defence plan, as only penis and overly confident attitude will propably not be enough. A small and thin man propably shouldn't do the same the husband in this did.", "Tbh, I've been in that woman's shoes, and I'd be terrified if the person I asked for help escalated the situation. I'm not sure a lot of commebters here understand just how real of a chance there is that one of these bozos gets violent. This time it turned out okay but when I was being followed by four men, and I found one person to help me call a cab (did not speak the language well), I didn't need the person I asked for help to puff up their chest and threaten to fight my harrassers. That would have been stupid and probably gotten us both hurt. Or when I was running from a guy and another man appeared and distracted him by pretending to know him so I could get away, that was helpful. A full-on brawl could have resulted in my helper being hurt too that time. Escalating is very rarely a good idea and I wish people cared more about the situation -- OP says they were in a busy area with lots of people around. Getting in a fight here would have been bad for multiple people and the husband could have ended up hurt or arrested. Walking with the woman or even loudly commenting \"HEY IS THAT GUY IN THE COAT FOLLOWING US, THAT'S WEIRD\" so other people hear would have been an effective deterrent. This moment of the husband getting up to go after the dude doesn't mean he'll never bother someone again, it was foolish. \n\nThat's a really long comment to say sure, the idea of fighting off creeps is nice, but it really isn't always what's best in the situation and OP's husband needs to get out of his superhero fantasy before he gets hurt. So NTA from me, having been the woman who needed help.", "It's not about being a hero or going into bat. What he did was just totally unnecessary in the given situation. They're very lucky it turned out the way it did, otherwise it may have been a case of much risk for little reward.", "Taking a stand wasn't necessary in this situation. Just continuing to walk with the girl would have been sufficient to get her to safety.", "And your mentality is why predators and creeps will keep on being predators and creeps, and women will never be safe.", "My husband has done this.  He was in his late 60\u2019s and isn\u2019t a large guy.  Creep was a 30\u2019s, bigger guy.  Scared the crap out of me but I was proud of him.  No way he wouldn\u2019t do it again in a similar situation.  OP can be scared but let the man know how awesome he is.", "not true, a lot of men would do this.", "No wonder.", "Kitty Genovese.", "Guess he shouldn't drive then because that's a lot more risky.", "Bullshit. I'm a short, fat, crippled woman that uses a cane and I've faced down abusers since I was 18 yo. Including one strung out on meth, cocaine and booze holding a knife on me. What's needed is courage and strong ethics you're willing to get hurt over not muscles. Or for that matter, balls.", "This is some ridiculous Andrew Tate sounding nonsense", "I agree, absolutely bullshit.\n\nThe other day a guy hit me right on the shoulder extremely hard and as a thoughtless reaction I punched him in the arm (I have never hit any one in my life outside of training). And you can see how shocked he was when someone pushed back and confronted him.", "That mentality can be applied to any situation.  Do we just completely stop helping strangers?  Stopping to help in a single car accident could end badly of they are freaked out/in shock and have a weapon.  An injured person somewhere could have just been attacked while having a weapon and could harm the person trying to come to their aid because they were panicking.  Theoretically giving a lost person directions could end in loss of life of they were just pretending to be lost.  \n\n\n\nI hate this fear based mentality people live in.  Are some situations riskier than others, absolutely.  Statistically the husband has a greater chance of getting severely injured or killed while driving is much higher, should she stop him from driving because it risks his life?", "And if he had a weapon \"Pretending to be her friend\" would have done fuck all. \n\nFact of the matter is that intimidation works. It's a force multiplayer. Most predators run away with their tail between their legs when they realize they aren't going to be walking away unscathed.\n\nI carry a handgun in my snowmobile in the winter time. Most of the time it's just for self defense in case I run into wild animals. But a few times, I've had to use the presence of it in order to get drunk creeps to leave a girl alone on the trails.", "If he had a weapon any interference on OP's husband's part could have ended badly. Guess he should just have ignored her.\n\nIf anyone wonders why abusers and predators act the way they do, it is because they know society has their back and will always support them over their victims or anyone who dares to step in.", "Standing up to this kind of guy can also cause them to escalate their behaviour, next time he goes out with intentions to approach a woman he might go armed with a weapon. There will always be creeps, the best and safest thing we can hope to do is just remove ourselves from the environment with as little fuss as possible.", "Your comment is so problematic", "That's just being a coward. You're a mouse, not a man.", "Her husband didn\u2019t puff up his chest. What he did was question if he was following her and why. The coward ran. It is just that simple. The guy in question didn\u2019t get violent he simply ran. \n\nI am glad that your situation turned out well but your situation was not HER situation.", "I've been in a similar position to OP's husband three times off the top of my head, and all of them were in very public places with other people around. The aggressors didn't care, until someone (me) confronted them. None of them escalated to a fight. So while I understand your perspective, my experience suggests otherwise.\n\nI've also had guys follow me down the street trying to fight me (again in broad daylight) just because of a comment I made, like suggesting they not relieve themselves on my doorway. So it's not like being less confrontational is any guarantee.", "It is not about what you think was necessary. He did what he thought was necessary and the guy ran off. \n\nHe asked if he was following this girl and why. There was nothing wrong with that.  Could he have handled it differently. Sure. But he didn\u2019t and the girl in question is safe and he did not come to harm.", "Well a lefty would have been too afraid to take such action,  low testosterone types", "His wife was with him though.  You have to weigh the safety of the entire party.  If you pick a fight with a potentially violent guy with your wife present, your wife might get hurt.  The woman who asked for help might be hurt.  Get the woman out of the dangerous situation, don't escalate it.", "That's a weird story. It wasn't fear that kept people from calling, more like everyone thought someone else was going to deal with it (from what I've read about it anyway). I forgot the name of the psychological condition. It's not groupthink, but it's kinda sorta related. It's why in an emergency situation, you point at people and tell them what to do if you want to get anything done.", "I\u2019m a 5\u20192\u201d disabled person with absolutely no experience fighting but I have acted like a full on crazy person in situations like this. \u201cHEY FUCKFACE. LEAVE HER THE FUCK ALONE HUH? Didn\u2019t she say DONT FUCKING TOUCH ME? DIDNT SHE? WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE? FUCKING WALK HOMIE. YOURE NOT WANTED. GO.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve been loud and confrontational with creeps my whole adolescent/adult life. The truth is most men think women are too afraid of them to say something so when you start making a scene and loudly drawing attention to their bad behaviours, they tend to beat a hasty exit.\n\nThis includes the time I grabbed a drunk meth dealer by his hair and threw him into the bathroom. I then DRESSED HIM DOWN LIKE HIS MAMA SHOULD HAVE and he left crying and apologizing.\n\nETA: a friend who quickly became not a friend brought him to my house, I wasn\u2019t in the business of hanging out with dudes like him.", "Many men have a principle to not hit a lady or otherwise use such violence. And obviously it's entirely up to the situation. My situations happened to have dangerous ones towards me atleast. Not all of them but some are. And sometimes you'd have to worry about a revenge too. \n\nYou can't just state it's easy to all men just to there and be knights, eventhough looks like you have no idea what's out there what we could potentially face in that scenario. And if every man can do it, why even bother to mention 'men' at all? Just everyone, interrupt sexual harassment you'll. Doesn't have to own testicles to do that.", "Well not a single person have managed to tell what's wrong. So unless you have an argument to express, take your non-sense elsewhere. Maybe thin and small dudes actually have some authority towards harassing drunk old dudes that I'm not aware of but for me it's common sense that a man who's presence is no bigger than an average lady's would be, would somehow be better option to interrupt harassment than the lady be. \n\nBy all means, reveal this hidden knowledge for me.\n\nEdit: Andrew Tate seems like a clown, so perhaps you should limit listening to his propaganda.", "Except the husband could have helped the girl without getting into a direct confrontation. The girl asked for them to pretend to know her and help her get to a place of safety, not confront the creep. Acting like there was no way to help this stranger without direct confrontation is full of fallacies.", "These are stupid analogies. There's a difference between helping someone in need and looking for a fight.", "Respectfully disagree, see my other comment in this thread for my rationale. You can't always manage your environment, and a lot of creeps can definitely be dissuaded. If he's the sort of person who would plan to use a weapon in a public place then pretending to be her uncle isn't a likely deterrent. Of course, no outcome is guaranteed.", "The wording might be harsh, but it's also realistic.\n\nIt was foolish, yet commendable of OP's husband to act this way. He got lucky it wasn't the worst case scenario at play. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt in that he might have read the dude in the moment better that anyone here just reading about it, but still.\n\nOP is right. The more level-headed approach is to keep things in control and de-escalate if needed. That's how you increase the chances of not getting anyone involved in immediate trouble/risk.\n\nWe don't know if *next time* this creep will have the perfect play field, a weapon and the courage to use it. No one ever knows if they're in the *next time*.\n\nIf this was it, maybe OP's daughter would've grown knowing her father just by the hero this story makes him to be.", "How?", "Oh, I've interrupted sexual harrasment a few times. I'm telling you, it's much easier nowadays when you have some physical presence. I used to be a lot smaller, and you think it's easy to go say shit to a drunken, potentially dangerous men?\n\nThen there are people like you, calling men mouses. No wonder toxic masculinity is everywhere.", "\"Puffing out your chest\" is a metaphor. Like the husband starting to approach the man and then later say he might have started a fight and would do it again. The action of approaching him was unnecessary and foolish. If you read my comment, I point out that I wish more people would take into account the situation at hand before loudly declaring that everyone should fight creeps all the time when this happens. We can say that it worked out this time because we have the post telling us that, but it also really easily could have gone sideways. OP's concerns are valid and all the responses saying more men should be confrontational are well-intentioned but really not very self-aware. The post is asking if OP is in the wrong for her reaction, and she's not.", "I didn't say never be confrontational, I said each situation requires attention before someone potentially starts a fight. (I've had my fair share of \"fights\" too, actually, where throwing a fist was what got me out of being grabbed, but that was in self defense and not after approaching the guy intentionally, and I was lucky it didn't get any worse). As I mentioned to someone else, it's easy to say \"well it worked out\" after the fact but she is not wrong for her reaction that it COULD HAVE very easily become dangerous, esp if they are in the US, and the husband needs to understand that. Standing up fornpeople is great but that doesn't always mean walking up to the creeper with the potential intention of fighting. There's noble and then there's dumb.", "(On a related note, how sad that so many of us have been in similar situations and so few other people in a crowded space cared enough to pay attention and de-escalate or help, however that would look in a specific situation. I feel like if we were better as a society of shaming this behavior on a normal basis, people wouldn't have to deal with the scary situations as often)", "fight or flight is often not a cognitive decision, it's just your body's natural response in that specific situation.", "Also, many people *did* attempt to call the police, and there wasn't anything like as many people watching as originally reported", "I don't know the story but if it's a case of no one doing anything because they think someone else will I think that's called the bystander effect?", "I think you may be talking about \"bystander effect\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect", "I think it's diffusion of responsibility, where everyone thinks someone else will take charge/action.

My friend is 5'5\" and pretty thin, but has studied Krav Maga for 10 years and could probably destroy most people \n\n2) Your argument is that only men need to learn how to fight, because why? Some outdated notion of chivalry? I have ANOTHER friend who is a woman and enjoys jiu-jitsu. She could also destroy most people. Everyone should know how to defend themselves, so by saying\"men need to protect women\" or anything like it is the real nonsense.\n\n3) Your arguments make you sound like some MRA, Andrew Tate type. These people are objectively incorrect about literally everything I've heard them say.", "You don't think think this person was in need of help?", "Hahaha. No. This is not how it works.\n\nWomen are being harrassed in full metros, buses and on the streets sometimes where there are a lot of other men and women around.

I don't think it means what you think it means.", "\"While he was there\" this is the whole problem.

There's no brave without at least a little dumb, and we all draw our own line.", "I still remember being a teenage boy on my town's main street doing my best Ralph Macchio pseudo karate blocks as some drunk thug threw lazy sidekicks, and the adults around us just watched, entertained.

Of course I could be wrong.", "All I'm saying is that there is a place and time.

He did phone the police (though with a slight delay)\n\nKitty went into the vestibule then which was harder to see and some neighbours did hear yelling when the attacker returned and didn't phone the police, however that was largely due to how common hearing those kinds of sounds were. \n\nOne neighbour did run down and found kitty and even accompanied her into the ambulance. She was with kitty when she died. \n\nIn reality the Kitty Genovese story has less to do with her being ignored and more to do with poor police response times, and people feeling helpless because the regular violence in the area had taught them that little would come of phoning the police.", "Actually, there weren't anything like that many people, and most of the witnesses did try to call the police. One even sat with her until the ambulance arrived.", "Totally untrue, many of those people called 911 and one of them came out to help her and comforted her as she died as they waited for an ambulance", "I am saying it i may wrong and biased.
