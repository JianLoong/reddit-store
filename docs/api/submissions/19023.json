Once i turned 20, u went through a major event which made me mature both emotionally and mentally. i now realize how messed up my parents & family are in general. \n\n2 days ago, my family had a family day planned, I am talking about the entire family. During lunch, we started conversing about some family issues and somehow the conversation turned to a comment I made some time ago about how I did not like some of my father's attitudes (racist & homophobic comments, slurs use, victim blaming, etc). \n\nDuring the argument, my father started getting agressive and raised his tone at me, some minutes after an heated argument, he decided that it would be justified to put his hands on me while i was sitting down, after he stood up and said he was not going to argue with me anymore and was going to leave. \n\nAfter my cousins pulled him away from me, i stood up from the ground, went to the bathroom, got cleaned and then came back. As I stepped foot outside, my father tried to attack me again while screaming that I was an embarrassment of a son and \"real\" man don't care about racism nor the f slurs - I was standing up and ready this time, so I fought back and he ended up with 3 knots on his forehead and a busted lip. \n\nMy entire family now says I was in the wrong for fighting back and should've just took the beating. My father isn't currently speaking to me and has given me 5 days to move out the house, and I still do not feel like I was in the wrong.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
