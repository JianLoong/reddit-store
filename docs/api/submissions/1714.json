About a year ago, our son was in daycare and both my husband and I were working full time.  But we started having a lot of issues with our daycare and felt they weren't doing enough to work with us on those issues.  Eventually, we had a \"last straw\" moment and pulled him out of that center.  For about 2-3 weeks, we took turns staying home with him while we tried to find a new daycare, but everywhere was either fully booked, too far away, or not what we were looking for.  We are on a waiting list for our top 2 picks, but they don't expect openings until early next year.  \n\nThat led to a hard conversation about what we were going to do.  We ended up deciding, together, that I would remain at work and my husband would stay at home with our son.  This was because of multiple factors.  My job gives better benefits, including our insurance.  It also pays more and offers more upward mobility.  \n\nI work in a highly competitive corporate environment and it can be very stressful.  That stress is made even worse by being the sole provider for our household.  I feel constant pressure to perform well at work.  In order to decompress after work, I use my company's gym facilities at our offices after work.  This usually takes me 30-60 minutes depending on my workout.  It's also a huge boost to my self-esteem because I'm still working towards getting my pre-birth body back. \n\nMy husband has started to gripe at me about staying at work later to workout.  I've explained to him that I use that time to decompress so that when I get home, I'm in full mommy/wife mode.  I don't want to rush home and still be thinking about work.  But he feels it's inconsiderate of me to take time for myself nearly every day when he doesn't get that same opportunity.  \n\nIt turned into a fight this past weekend because he made a comment about it again and I told him that I am not going to change my routine.  I told him it's the easiest way for me to work out and that it doesn't add that much time to me being out of the house since I can workout at my office.  I told him that I'm constantly stressed at work and working out before I get home allows me to relieve that stress so when I get home I'm fully present.  \n\nI also reminded him that hopefully we can get our son back into daycare in a few months and that this is all short-term.  I give him plenty of time to himself on weekends so it's not like he never has time for himself.  I told him the stress of being the sole provider is a huge burden that I feel every day and my workout routine is the biggest thing that helps me cope with that.  \n\nHe told me that I'm being selfish and that I may be a good provider, but I'm being a crap mother and wife.  I told him that is by far the meanest thing he has ever said to me and all he said was \"Sometimes the truth hurts.\" He refused to apologize to me and doesn't understand why I need that time for myself.", "created_utc": 1667833509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yopmla/aita_for_refusing_to_change_my_workout_routine_to/", "score": 394, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm a stay at home dad and have been for almost 10 years now. My wife is an executive and works very long hours and often travels for the full week. When our son was 3 weeks old and we had our daughter who was 5 it was tough but I managed. \n\nThis is my suggestion for the both of you. You guys need to sit down and have an actual discussion about this, not this back and forth crap. If you are going to make it work this way, BOTH of you have to make compromises. I love being a SAHP but it's not for every person and not everyone is cut out for it. \n\nI do think you need an outlet to destress, if that's exercise which I totally get as a triathlete, he should support you in this. On the flip side maybe it's not every single day but 3 days a week, or maybe you come home on the other two days and you guys go for family walks to decompress and burn some energy off the little one. \n\nMarriage is about team work and two people making compromises to the betterment of the couple. You made a tough decision leaving a daycare early without another lined up. You made another one by choosing your husband to stay home. This scenario was almost exactly what my wife and I ran into. \n\nYou guys have to communicate to each other, in a health tone. I wish you guys the very best of luck. I don't think either of you are the a-hole here.

Does he get 30-60 minutes daily alone outside of the home doing his hobbies? He may feel trapped in the house as being a stay at home parent can be very isolating. \n\nAlso I see 0 quality communication in this post. I see a lot of \"I \\[do this\\]\" in the post but nothing about what his day looks like or even any attempt at compromise. Learn to communicate about ***both*** of your wants and needs better not just yours and how ***both*** of you can better create environments to fulfill them. i.e. you alternate which days you go to the gym so that on the other day he gets 30-60 minutes out of the house.

If you could find a way to move it to after your son fell asleep or do it for half the time or made some kind of agreement where you could take over something as a result to give your husband that hour back, it\u2019d be fine.

While yes, I know you feel totally stressed about your job, and he shouldn\u2019t have said those things, doesn\u2019t he feel stressed being a full time father? I would say there\u2019s nothing wrong with working out, but you may need to shorten the length of time (30-60 min when your husband has been alone with the child all day already can be exhausting), or you need to split it up - work out at the gym for 15-20 min and then find a workout routine at home when your kid is asleep (even if it\u2019s just some light stretching, Pilates, or yoga). \n\nBut I think there is another issue - he\u2019s also probably feeling pretty lonely and neglected in the relationship between your job and your workout, and maybe he just wants some alone time with the two of you. I highly recommend you sit down with him and make a plan that works for both of you - both in terms of your workout as well as just for the two of you.

What about going in early 2 days a week and exercising before work, then after the other 3 days? Does your gym offer childcare? what about inviting hubby to join you at the gym and use the gym childcare if it does? Even if you don't work out \"together\" its some \"me\" time for him. Try to find a compromise because if you don't you will soon be TA. Also, look at it from inside his shoes. if you had decided HE was the one to keep working and you stayed home, and he did the identical thing, how would you feel? You need to discuss it...", "NAH. You need to figure out a way to give him an hour away from the baby everyday. Maybe when you get home you can get changed into your jammies and he can go for a bike ride or a walk or play a video game or whatever it is he does to decompress.", "ESH. In this case, ESH stands for \"Everyone's stressed here.\" You both have challenging jobs, one at the office and one working from home. You need to sit down on a weekend when there's a little less stress and exhaustion, and negotiate. It'd be ideal if you could have family or a friend take your son for an hour or two. Just sit down with some coffee or wine and work something out. \n\nThings that will probably come up during negotiations:\n\n\\-Your husband needs more day to day \"me time\" just not time on weekends. He's with a 2 year old for about 12 hours straight every day. \n\n\\-You are stressed being the breadwinner. Gym time is good for your mental (and physical) health. \n\n\\-No one's time is more important or stressful than the other. You're in this together. \n\n\\-Reduce your gym time to 2 or 3x week, and workout at home each weekend day. Jog, stream a workout, whatever it takes. It's only temporary. \n\n\\-If your husband's \"me time\" includes a workout as well, have him join Planet Fitness for $10/month, or subscribe to a streaming workout for use at home. he can workout during son's nap time, or when you get home and give him some time. \n\n\\-If possible, both of you could go for evening or morning walks together with your son. Gets everyone out of the house, gets some exercise, and decompress together. \n\nBest of everything-you'll get through this.", "After reading the post and comments. I'm going to go with NTA. Because it sounds like you are gone a total of twelve hours (work, workout, commute). Then you take over when you get home.\n\nIf you are getting eight hours of sleep and taking an hour to get ready in the morning. That means your husband is getting three hours of free time each day. While you actually only get one hour of free time which is spent working out.\n\nThen on weekends he gets all free time and you get none. It actually sounds like you are putting more hours in than him. On weekdays he gets ten more hours of free time than you and thirty two hours on the weekend while you get none.\n\nAnyways, this brings up the my question. You were both working professionals. Did your husband make a good wage? I'm asking because you two may be much happier to hire a live in nanny. So what if it burns through most of the extra income he brings in from working? It sounds like you two would be much happier with that arrangement. You'll both advance in your careers over time making a nanny less of a burden. Your child will get better care than with a daycare.", "NAH. You're both stressed out. You need to release your work tension so you can be in mommy mode when you get home. I understand. Would it be feasible to do a 5 day meal prep on weekends so that when you get home you can give hubby a kiss and let him go \"off duty\" for an hour while you make dinner? Maybe he could go for a run or a walk, or go game in the bedroom for an hour or whatever he likes. Then you could have a nice meal together, and them both do bedtime. I guess that only works if your off work early enough. In any case, he needs to be able to go off and destress when you get home.\n\nRight now you're both in your own camps. You need to verbalize recognition of his also indispensable role, try and open up the camp borders to each other, and come to an agreement that gives him his space but doesn't take away yours.", "YTA,\n\nYou're not listening to your husband. You get 30-60 min 5x per week to dedicate solely to yourself.  Your husband should also get that time as well.  This is true if the roles were reversed.", "INFO: \nCan you elaborate on the reasons you ended the relationship with the daycare your child was at? \n\nJust wondering if the child needs special care or is special needs that makes it harder to look after or if both of you were very busy people and weren't able to make it on time before they closed.", "YTA. not necessarily for wanting to work out, but for refusing to even entertain a compromise. Your husband has turned his entire life upside down to leave his job and stay at home with your child and you\u2019re unwilling to even consider SLIGHTLY changing your routine?", "Disclaimer: I would say the same if she was a man\n\nNTA: Being the sole provider may be stressful as hell, even more in a competitive environment and sometimes one hour in the gym is better than the provider getting a mental beackdown.\n\n\nNow, in my experience as a babysitter. Taking care of a 2ya is not that hard if yoy are organized (but then again everyone is different).  I think the conflict is deeper than that and you might want to have a thorough discussion with your husband. Maybe he is having an issue with his self-worth. \n\nSpeaking of babysitter, did you try having one? Like 1 day a week? This way the husband can have a full day for himself.\n\nLast idea, workout at home at least one day a week, you can do a yoga (for stretching day) and implicate your child in a playful way.", "NAH. Whilst this workout seems to have many potential benefits for your health, mental and physical, it doesn't directly benefit him. It is an additional 30-60 minutes that your husband looks after the child alone. So perhaps there could be a compromise with your husband where he gets some time to himself too? (E.g. you only work out a few days a week instead of every day, or when you get home, he gets 30-60 minutes to himself.) \n\nHe definitely dealt with it a bit harshly and should've tried for a compromise instead of calling you a crap wife and mother, but 12 hours a day looking after a child takes a toll on people and perhaps he said some things he didn't mean.", "Either N A H or ESH, and I\u2019m going the latter because your arrangement needs constant communication, checking in with each other, and compromise.\n\nWhat you have is a gender reversal of a stereotypical traditional relationship.

Basically, a lot of stress from work/home causes a lot of stress on the body and working out is a great way to relieve that. \n\nOn the other hand, YTA because giving him \"plenty of time for himself on the weekends\" is not the same as you taking time for yourself nearly every day, as you wrote. If that were true, why don't you go home immediately after work and de-stress on the weekends? I don't think the problem is that you take time for yourself to work out, I think the problem is the frequency.

Whereas you get it nearly every day (I'm guessing that could be up to 5 times per week, if you work out every day). \n\nMaybe you could take turns so that each one of you gets some time to yourself every other day?

About a year ago, our son was in daycare and both my husband and I were working full time.  But we started having a lot of issues with our daycare and felt they weren't doing enough to work with us on those issues.  Eventually, we had a \"last straw\" moment and pulled him out of that center.  For about 2-3 weeks, we took turns staying home with him while we tried to find a new daycare, but everywhere was either fully booked, too far away, or not what we were looking for.  We are on a waiting list for our top 2 picks, but they don't expect openings until early next year.  \n\nThat led to a hard conversation about what we were going to do.  We ended up deciding, together, that I would remain at work and my husband would stay at home with our son.  This was because of multiple factors.  My job gives better benefits, including our insurance.  It also pays more and offers more upward mobility.  \n\nI work in a highly competitive corporate environment and it can be very stressful.  That stress is made even worse by being the sole provider for our household.  I feel constant pressure to perform well at work.  In order to decompress after work, I use my company's gym facilities at our offices after work.  This usually takes me 30-60 minutes depending on my workout.  It's also a huge boost to my self-esteem because I'm still working towards getting my pre-birth body back. \n\nMy husband has started to gripe at me about staying at work later to workout.  I've explained to him that I use that time to decompress so that when I get home, I'm in full mommy/wife mode.  I don't want to rush home and still be thinking about work.  But he feels it's inconsiderate of me to take time for myself nearly every day when he doesn't get that same opportunity.  \n\nIt turned into a fight this past weekend because he made a comment about it again and I told him that I am not going to change my routine.  I told him it's the easiest way for me to work out and that it doesn't add that much time to me being out of the house since I can workout at my office.  I told him that I'm constantly stressed at work and working out before I get home allows me to relieve that stress so when I get home I'm fully present.  \n\nI also reminded him that hopefully we can get our son back into daycare in a few months and that this is all short-term.  I give him plenty of time to himself on weekends so it's not like he never has time for himself.  I told him the stress of being the sole provider is a huge burden that I feel every day and my workout routine is the biggest thing that helps me cope with that.  \n\nHe told me that I'm being selfish and that I may be a good provider, but I'm being a crap mother and wife.  I told him that is by far the meanest thing he has ever said to me and all he said was \"Sometimes the truth hurts.\" He refused to apologize to me and doesn't understand why I need that time for myself.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I think soft YTA because I feel you have to be a little more flexible with the work out thing. You're stressed but so is him, maybe he feels he doesn't get enough attention, idk. What he said about you being a crap mom and wife was pretty mean, I give you that one. Total asshole move. On the other hand, I fully understand you, I love working out myself 6 days a week, but sometimes life happens and I have had to change my workout routine, sometimes I've had too much work so I wake up earlier so I can do it, etc, nothing can be that inflexible imo. This is short term, so I believe you and your husband can have an agreement, maybe stay at the gym some days, and others be home earlier? I don't know. Also, there's lots of exercises you can do at home, internet is full of them, personally I've never been to a gym in my life. I think you two can make things work being more flexible (both of you) and understanding each other's needs, you have to be a team instead of criticizing each other. Good luck!", "Info: when you get home, do you allocate 60 mins every weekday for him to disconnect and do something healthy for himself? I don't mean waiting until the weekend but allowing for him to decompress every day as well?", "Yikes, another one of these...\n\nNTA.  You work in a high stress job.  That time to decompress is important.  Not only for you, but for your husband and child, too.  Coming home tired and stressed makes for a tense and unpleasant home environment.  This would affect both of them, too.\n\nTake it from a disabled, single father; being a SAHP isn't actually hard.  With even the most basic time management and planning, you have plenty of spare time and opportunity to do things you like.  (Even while disabled.  Which, yeah, makes things harder.)\n\nI've noticed a lot of these posts seem to have a lot of logical blindness (not an actual term, I know).  Like a lack of object permanence, in a way.  People forget that when a person isn't there, they're still out out in the world, doing things.  Mostly, it's just basic selfishness.  They're so focused on what *they're* doing that they don't take into account that the other person is also existing.\n\nThere's a developing expectation for working parents to immediately take over all childcare, as soon as they clock out, on social media.  Somehow, people have become convinced that being a SAHP is some laborious, neverending slog.  Thankless, soul-destroying and exhausting.\n\nI always wonder why they wanted to be parents.\n\nBeing with your kids, all day, can be draining, I'll admit.  \"Familiarity breeds contempt,\" and all that.\n\nThat's what you signed up for, though.  They can be draining, they can be messy... Hell, any parent can tell you; they can be little assholes, sometimes.  That's what you signed up for.\n\nWell, that and the little hands, holding onto your thumbs...  The little noises, when they're comfy and happy.  The laughs, when you make silly faces or tickle them.  Hearing them say \"Mama\" or \"Dada\" for the first time.  Watching them grow and take their first steps.  Every time they run, just for a hug from you...\n\nBut, yeah, changing a few diapers and doing some laundry and dishes is too much to ask, in exchange.\n\nI may have gotten off track, but yeah...\n\nAnyway, just make sure to give him equal time to decompress, each day, too and you're good.", "Esh.. sounds like you guys need to sit down and have a civil conversation about this. Yes you work hard however staying home with the baby can also be stressful and he is contributing in that way (as well as giving up his career to care for your son).

Honestly, I imagine he\u2019s a little jealous and resentful that he\u2019s the one who stopped working. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you making your health a priority. It sounds like he could work out if he wanted - either in the morning before you leave or in the evening after you get home not to mention the weekends. You deserve a way to de-stress some. If you can\u2019t afford a sitter to give him a little time (like others suggested) maybe only work out 3-4 days a week. Everyone asking what you do the around the house is being ridiculous. Naturally he is going to do more. He\u2019s home. Although his excuse about cooking with your kid at home is a little pathetic. My mom was able to cook with two kids running around. Can it be a little tricky? Yeah probably. But that\u2019s part of the job.  You two definitely need to have a talk to figure out what truly is his issue with you taking a little extra time for yourself, why he is so upset by it and then find a compromise.", "   YTA.    You are being rather grand about this.   You expect your partner to work 12 hours watching your mutual child, and cook the dinner, and probably do a few chores around the house, while you get to work out at a probably very nice gym five days a week? You gotta be kidding me !\n\n  That\u2019s not a fair division of labor at all, especiallyIf you come in telling him all about what a great workout you had. Which you probably do.    \n\n   A fair division of labor would be you go to your job, he stays home with your son.  You work out three days a week at your gym \u2013 Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and bring home take-out food  those days.   He gets to work out Tuesdays and Thursdays,  and  you come home and cook the meal and take care of the kid. He also gets six hours of time to himself on Saturday, where he can have a period without any chores or child or kind of stuck up wife.\n\n   Otherwise, if you don\u2019t lighten up and be respectful of his efforts and time, you will wind up having the baby one full week at a time and he will pick up the baby that weekend, and then the next week he will have the baby full-time, and you will pick up the baby every that weekend, because you\u2019ll probably be divorced.", "You are NTA and your husband is being unreasonable.

Working out before work, working out together at a gym with child care, or working out after your son goes to sleep are all potential fixes to the immediate problem. The larger issue of communication is more important to address. Sniping at each other is only going to make the problem worse and isn't productive behavior.

But not necessarily true. Are you genuinely as stressed as you claim by being the sole provider? Do you really need that time to decompress, or do you just want it? \nI think it\u2019s at least possible that you\u2019ve formulated a palatable narrative which enables you to feel justified in continuing to do what you want. \n\nConsider, for example, what would happen if you did give up/limit your workouts temporarily. You say you\u2019d go home still in work mode. Is that true? Or would you go home grumpy because you couldn\u2019t work out? Stressed because you\u2019re not working towards losing baby weight? \n\nThose would be legitimate feelings. But they\u2019re not what you\u2019re claiming you\u2019d feel. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just pedantic (I am) but personally as your partner I\u2019d be so much less willing to compromise if I got a sense that you were trying to sell me something rather than trying to figure out what you had. \n\nIf it happened to be true that your chosen narrative isn\u2019t strictly accurate then you\u2019d face the problem of whether it\u2019s legitimate to take an hour to get yourself happy, rather than sucking it up and putting aside possible grumpiness until you find a new day care. From my choice of wording I guess it seems I tend toward the latter, but you might be able to reach some compromise with your partner whereby, as others have suggested, you both get time to take care of yourselves. \n\nIf it\u2019s not true - that is, if you really feel that you\u2019d still be stressed from work, not just cross to have to sacrifice your progress without your workouts - then it might still be helpful to mention this possibility to your partner: I find it very helpful with my boyfriend to communicate that I\u2019ve considered, for example, ways in which I might not have been wholly honest with myself, and concluded that I really think I\u2019m not just justifying myself. \n\nUltimately I really sympathise with you. I constantly feel torn between taking care of myself and taking care of others, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an absolute answer. Being happier when you get home is valid. Showing your partner that you\u2019re willing to make sacrifices is, too. It\u2019s very hard to tell which would be more useful. Maybe express that to your partner: that you don\u2019t know but you are genuinely trying your best. \n\nYour partner\u2019s comment was cruel and unproductive.

This appears to be an out-of-character reaction to accommodating something in your schedule that is so mission critical to your mental health and well being, but he can\u2019t even acknowledge the value of it. Which is how someone who is drowning may react to anything except a life preserver. So I think you are a bit of an AH to be wondering as to whether you are in the wrong rather than feelings really worried for your husband and wondering how you can build him up.

I used to pace the windows waiting for my husband to come round the corner of the street so I could hand child over to someone else.

Could I maybe suggest (coming from a place of understanding for both of you) that maybe twice a week you skip the gym workout, get home, put child into a good running buggy and go out with him for a nice exercise run? That way you get time to destress and your hubby gets to sit down and have half an hour just to gather himself again. Staying at home with a child is not an easy way to spend your day and the relief you get when your partner comes in is, frankly, indescribable.", "NAH. I am surprised at the number of people saying YTA, or saying that you should only work out a few times a week. I don't know what your experience is, but for me, exercise is a total non-negotiable. It needs to happen every day or my mental health and executive function declines to the point where I'm the worst version of myself.

Would it be possible for you come home at your normal time, but push your son in a stroller while you jog? Or maybe you can get a baby buggy that attaches to bicycles? You wouldn\u2019t have to do this every day, but I think it would go a long way towards solving the problem you and your husband are dealing with now. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to give up working out, but you should help your husband out where you can. \n\nNAH because you need a ruling.\n\nEdit: I thought of another solution. If you live in a city with a YMCA, you should consider getting a membership. I know that the gym at work is free, but YMCAs have free on-site childcare for a couple of hours while you work out.

By using her company gym she isn't paying for a gym or taking time to travel to an external gym so this is the most effective way for her to exercise.  \nShe also does say that she turns to full mommy mode when she gets home so he DOES get a break every day and also on weekends.", "Please add an NAH so this counts for judgement or she\u2019ll get an Y.T.A!", "Great advice.

When dads do this everyone thinks it's natural and normal. But it's not natural and normal, and those guys' wives usually end up leaving them for this exact reason. It sucks that men don't get called out on this and you have been, but really what should probably be happening is those men should be getting called out the same as you are.
