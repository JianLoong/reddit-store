Very, very rarely do groups ask the entire amount to be split 8 (or however many) ways. What a source of anxiety that would be to me to not know a budget for my outing.", "NTA. \n\nSeveral years ago, a three of my fellow alumni and I took 4 students out for a networking dinner. It was solidly a mid-level place - around $50 -70 per person plus tax and tip. The idea was that we\u2019d split the check 4 ways. I mentally estimated $150 -$175 per alum and was approved to put the meal on my company card as a marketing expense. We all worked in a similar field and had a similar income. \n\nThe meal was lovely. The students were friendly. Two of the alumni ordered heavier, as is always the case - think cocktails, appetizers, entrees, and desserts. While most people shared apps and desserts and skipped the cocktails. Whatever. Not a huge deal. \n\nBut then the check came. One of the guys announced that he \u201cowed\u201d the other guy dinner, so the entire check would be split 3 ways. Not only was the check higher because they were having the rest of us subsidize but they had planned ahead of time that we\u2019d be fully subsidizing the meal. Each share was close to $250 with tax and tip. \n\nThe FINAL STRAW was later that night the guy that paid zero dollars made a self-congratulatory social media post about how he was \u201cpaying it forward\u201d by treating students to dinner. This was 4 years ago and I haven\u2019t spoken to either of them since.", "NTA. I honestly don\u2019t know where these stories come from because whenever I have gone out we separate checks unless someone is planning on paying for the meal. It\u2019s so odd to me.

You did nothing wrong. hopefully your friend realized what an asshole Aaron is, and dumped him after!", "NTA. Most of my friends and I just split the bill when we go out, sometimes one person isn't drinking/doesn't order as much as the others but that changes each time and so it all evens out. That's not the case here, your check is always cheaper than theirs. If you were to just split the bill then every single time you all go out you'd be partially paying for their food, and that's just not fair longterm. \n\nAaron needs to mind his own business. Honestly it sounds like he over ordered because he assumed the bill would be split and it would work out in his favor, and then threw a tantrum when you didn't want to foot the bill which is just pathetic of him.", "NTA. I would expect an apology from Aaron, he wouldn't be welcome till he apologizes.  It's not your problem Aaron is a cheapskate. It's not you, it's him.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nMy friend group used to all ask for a single bill, we'd figure out what each of us individually got, and 1 friend would pay, and everyone would send them money for their amount. Everyone would tell him their amount with tip, add it all together, and then he would add whatever his was at the end. Many of us tended to tip pretty generously or just to make rounding easier. A $42 bill just became $50 with tip for ease.\n\nThis would result in some nights, the tip being upwards of $150 or more. The bill would come, and he would add whatever extra as tip amount. So, a $600 bill between everyone would be $750 or more.\n\nThis was all fine for a while, until we caught him just putting in 15% tip, and pocketing everything else that we sent him. Everyone had sent him a total of like $650 that night, the total bill was only around $450, with 15% tip he paid like $520, and tried to pocket $130.\n\nWe don't hang out with him anymore for that, and other reasons.", "NTA. I love separating the bill. I have allergies and I also drink more. So it\u2019s only fair that I pay for mine.

There were maybe a dozen of us getting dinner together, and we all had separate checks. And I'll admit we were a handful, our waitress was fantastic however. When it came time to pay she brought us each our separate bills and I pulled out cash for mine and added a fairly generous tip. The girl sitting next to me saw I had cash and asked if she could go ahead and pay with her card for both mine and hers so that she could avoid having to go to the ATM for cash for the following days activities. That seemed perfectly reasonable to me so I handed over my cash and my slip and she went ahead and paid. I got a glimpse of the total that she paid and My brain registered the number but I didn't really think about it until later after a number of other events had happened that made me extremely suspicious. Turns out she took my generous tip and put it towards her food and then barely added any tip to the total. She was also driving us the following day since she had the largest vehicle and of course she showed up to pick us all up with no gas in her car, so once we're all loaded up she pulls into a gas station and goes out to pump gas. All five of us riding with her reach into our purses and pull out a bit of cash to hand her towards gas. We didn't really ask her how much she needed, but I know most of us handed her a $10 bill and they were a couple of 20s. I happen to get a glimpse of the pump just as we started a drive away, she put $43 of gas in her car, and never offered anyone any change back. Counted it in front of us and stuck it into her pocket while the gas was still pumping into her car. On the third day we had stopped for lunch at another restaurant, an hour party was crowded into two tables. I was seated at the same table as her and we had picked up a couple of extra stragglers by this point who latched on to our party. One of them ordered a large pizza when they joined our table for all of us to share in addition to all the food we already had. When it came time to settle up they tossed more than enough money for the pizza onto the table, the rest of us started pulling out money for our food and we realized this woman was missing. So are some of the pizza. She had boxed it up and taken it home with her and not put in any money towards either the food she ordered or the pizza she partook in. And her food had been the most expensive item on the table so the rest of us had a dip into our pockets for more cash to settle up our tables bill. \n\nThis was when we all started comparing notes and everybody at this gathering had fallen victim to this woman at some point or the other over the past 3 days. It was actually kind of impressive how she managed to pull it off. The irony here, her and her husband each individually made more money than any of the rest of us. For all of the rest of us this was a vacation we had scrimped and saved for and it really stung to realize that between all of us we were funding her vacation. She got away with paying next to nothing for most of the activities and probably pocketed some cash.", "Not so much about tips but I work at a classy place, expensive bills, high cost per item. This big group came in, drinking like fish, lots of spirit mixers, lots of wine, lots of cocktails. A couple of people leave early and pay chunks of the bill as they go. Eventually the group starts to shrink a lot while still somehow adding to the total bill at broadly the same rate. Gets to the end of the night and there's just two women left, they start to make moves to leave and we have to kind of awkwardly stop them as they're halfway down the bar and be like \"you guys still have quite a substantial tab that we need to settle before we can let you head out\" thankfully they were nice about it and paid up and hopefully they can recoup their losses from their shitty friends. But it did strike me and the other staff as unfair that these women had to pay for everything because they just happened to be the last ones standing.

They'd go out for dinner sometimes and my mother, a teetotaler, would have a diet coke, some of the other people would have 3-4 drinks at $8-$10 each and then expect to divide the bill evenly.\n\nMy mom paid the first time,  but declined any future brunch or dinner invites with that group. She didn't want to be confrontational because she had to continue to work with this group and didn't want there to be an issue. She'd still do things with them like theater outings or movies, where there was a fixed ticket price, but would just decline dinner or drinks afterward.\n\nSometimes it is the best way to handle it.", "That's where diplomacy is needed.

To my understanding, I'm the 1st white dude that anyone has seen him friends with. \n\nBut as nice and easy-going as he is, I never lose track of who he really is and what he does.

I am confrontational protective of my family and friends and proud of it!!!\n\nI always ask for a separate check right before I place my order in a group setting and make no apologies for doing so .  I've been burnt too many times not to do so.  The only people I don't do this with is when I am with my Mom cause we generally order the same priced items off of the menu.

I\u2019ve lived in the US all my life and it is a rare occasion that a restaurant doesn\u2019t have a card reader and in the majority of those rare cases it\u2019s because the owner has some opinion on it and refuses to get one. Also it\u2019s not culture to just split the bill. I\u2019ve been in many circles and interacted with all sorts of people and VERY rarely does the bill get split.

Should have just had a conversation when the bill came.\" or \"And we may find that other people were actually *unaware* they were violating invisible or unspoken boundaries\" about something this blatant, you're encouraging the mindset that allows this manipulative behavior to flourish.\n\nWhen you go out to eat with someone and you consume significantly more than they do, no rational, basically decent person would expect the other person to pay for half of their meal.  That's something that anyone with a brain can see is selfish and unfair.  Like sure sure, maybe if it were a huge table of people, and most people got an alcoholic drink and an entree, and you didn't realize that one couple drank water and split a sandwich because they were at the other end of the table, it could have been an accident.  But in this situation, as in the OP, the person trying to split the bill isn't accidentally, unwittingly violating \"invisible or unspoken boundaries\".  They are trying to take advantage of people by abusing their friend's desire to avoid conflict.  And if someone calls them on it, they can just say \"Oh I didn't realize!  If they didn't want to pay half they should have spoken up an I would have *happily* paid my own bill!  They should have *said something*.\"  The idea that \"they might be unaware\" is a deliberate part of the game, so they blame the victim so they can continue taking advantage of people like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor your own life skills is it good to learn to say \"no\" to manipulative boundary pushing people?  Absolutely.  But it is completely and totally reasonable and acceptable to do whatever makes the most sense to you in the moment, and then just never hang out with that person again.  That's not an issue of you not being good enough at standing up for your boundaries.  You're not required to give manipulative selfish people multiple chances to hurt you because \"how was I supposed to know you didn't want me to punch you in the face?  You've got to speak up and stop being so passive aggressive.\"", "I don't know about you, but I consider talking to be a big part of being friends, and being human.\n\nBut I guess there are people with too many friends.

I try to read sentences without following the language used too much though, because it's human nature to word things in a way which is favourable to ourselves, especially when we're upset about things.
