You have valid reasons for getting a separate bill and your friends have never made an issue of it before. It's unfair for Aaron to judge you and insult you without understanding your situation. It's like going to a shoe store where everyone is buying the same shoes except for one person who has a different shoe size and then blaming that person for not fitting in. Your food restrictions and personal choices are just like that different shoe size. Don't feel bad for being considerate of others and taking responsibility for your own expenses.", "NTA\n\nIt's obviously well established within your group that you pay separately. Even if it wasn't, you have the right to only pay for what you order. \n\nHis reaction was pretty scary and out of line. Also, the fact that it doesn't sound like your friends did anything to stop him or back you up would make me want to distance myself from them for a while, at least. I get that they may have been shocked, but there's no way in hell I'd ever let someone yell and scream at my friend that way while I just sit there. \n\nJust know that you did nothing wrong, and this guy is a giant red flag.", "Server here.

Do you chip in anything on those rare occasions that you do help yourself to something ordered by someone else?

Your real friends have been ok with this for a decade and only when a new random person is introduced does he have an unreasonably over the top reaction, how can you think anyone other than the person who started yelling in a restaurant about an arrangement he clearly didn't understand is an asshole?
