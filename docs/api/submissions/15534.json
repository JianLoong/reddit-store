I am a server/bartender and far and away the most common way to do this is separate checks for each person or couple. Maybe one of ten groups will rotate who pays the entire bill. Very, very rarely do groups ask the entire amount to be split 8 (or however many) ways. What a source of anxiety that would be to me to not know a budget for my outing.", "NTA. \n\nSeveral years ago, a three of my fellow alumni and I took 4 students out for a networking dinner. It was solidly a mid-level place - around $50 -70 per person plus tax and tip. The idea was that we\u2019d split the check 4 ways. I mentally estimated $150 -$175 per alum and was approved to put the meal on my company card as a marketing expense. We all worked in a similar field and had a similar income. \n\nThe meal was lovely. The students were friendly. Two of the alumni ordered heavier, as is always the case - think cocktails, appetizers, entrees, and desserts. While most people shared apps and desserts and skipped the cocktails. Whatever. Not a huge deal. \n\nBut then the check came. One of the guys announced that he \u201cowed\u201d the other guy dinner, so the entire check would be split 3 ways. Not only was the check higher because they were having the rest of us subsidize but they had planned ahead of time that we\u2019d be fully subsidizing the meal. Each share was close to $250 with tax and tip. \n\nThe FINAL STRAW was later that night the guy that paid zero dollars made a self-congratulatory social media post about how he was \u201cpaying it forward\u201d by treating students to dinner. This was 4 years ago and I haven\u2019t spoken to either of them since.", "NTA.

Most of my friends and I just split the bill when we go out, sometimes one person isn't drinking/doesn't order as much as the others but that changes each time and so it all evens out. That's not the case here, your check is always cheaper than theirs. If you were to just split the bill then every single time you all go out you'd be partially paying for their food, and that's just not fair longterm. \n\nAaron needs to mind his own business. Honestly it sounds like he over ordered because he assumed the bill would be split and it would work out in his favor, and then threw a tantrum when you didn't want to foot the bill which is just pathetic of him.", "NTA. I would expect an apology from Aaron, he wouldn't be welcome till he apologizes.  It's not your problem Aaron is a cheapskate. It's not you, it's him.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nMy friend group used to all ask for a single bill, we'd figure out what each of us individually got, and 1 friend would pay, and everyone would send them money for their amount. Everyone would tell him their amount with tip, add it all together, and then he would add whatever his was at the end. Many of us tended to tip pretty generously or just to make rounding easier. A $42 bill just became $50 with tip for ease.\n\nThis would result in some nights, the tip being upwards of $150 or more. The bill would come, and he would add whatever extra as tip amount. So, a $600 bill between everyone would be $750 or more.\n\nThis was all fine for a while, until we caught him just putting in 15% tip, and pocketing everything else that we sent him. Everyone had sent him a total of like $650 that night, the total bill was only around $450, with 15% tip he paid like $520, and tried to pocket $130.\n\nWe don't hang out with him anymore for that, and other reasons.", "NTA. I love separating the bill. I have allergies and I also drink more. So it\u2019s only fair that I pay for mine.

I\u2019m in NZ and the standard is to pay at the door on the way out - each person just tells the cashier which portion of the bill was theirs and pays (no tip or separate tax involved)", "It is related. I just showed you a legit example of the government forcing you to subsidize mortgages for people who simply didn\u2019t want to figure out how money works. In this example a non-drinker is subsidizing the habits of the drinkers. Maybe if you used both sides of your brain you can see the slight jump I took to get there. \n\nI\u2019m not the snowflake hun, the people who can\u2019t see the connection are. You\u2019re weak man. Men like me run over men like you.\n\nAnd for the record I 100% voted for Biden. But I can also see that radical turn the left has taken since that time. I just hope we can get a better presidential candidate that two 80 year old white dudes.", "Here in Denmark it's also the norm. Unless someone explicitly invites the other people out for dinner, everyone pays for themselves.\n\n(Excluding families, where the parents pay for minor kids, and often for grown-up kids as well, and couples who live together and therefore often have shared finances. But with friend groups, split bills are the norm).", "One of our circle was back from deployment and screamed at him like a drill sergeant in the parking lot, and he cried in front of his gf before driving off without her, so I think he paid in the end.", "Or like the Joker burning his half, less the supplies needed to set it on fire. \n\n\"It's not about the money... It's about... Sending a message.\"", "Sure but if you're so afraid of confrontation that you let a small problem fester until you lash out later, you can be an asshole for it.\n\nThe whole thing could have easily been an honest misunderstanding or mistake resolved by a conversation. They were apparently drinking a lot, it wouldn't be outlandish for them to default to just splitting a bill without thinking about it. Instead OC assumes bad intentions and waits until they try to hang out later to say a pissy \u201cyou mean so you guys could drink for half price?\u201d", "Midwestern Gen Xer here and I literally had no idea even splits was a thing until maybe a decade ago.  I have never even had anyone suggested.  Don't know if it is generational or regional, but it seems like the stupidest thing I've heard in this department.  Pay for what you eat and drink, end of story.  Math really isn't that hard (eyeball the tax if you must) if you are at a place that won't split up the bill for you.", "This is what stood out to me. If this is how he behaves around people he doesn\u2019t know, when most people are on their best behaviour, imagine how he acts behind closed doors where he is comfortable. I would be very concerned for his girlfriend ( op\u2019s friend) I hesitate to use the word abusive but I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019d be a pleasant companion once he drops the \u201ccharm\u201d act", "He could also be racist. OP says she doesn't drink alcohol for religious reasons. If she's Muslim or another minority with darker skin, that could be why this jerk was so antagonistic towards her.", "If servers don't want to create separate bills for people, then they need to make that clear at the beginning.  Like a sign on the door, and a note on the menu.  Otherwise, I never would have thought that it's something a server couldn't do.", "*forever*? \ud83d\ude02\n\nHow old are you?  You do realize that people have been dining out in the US for generations?  While 20% is closer to the norm in 2023 (the pandemic raised it a bit) when tipping became an *expected* practice in the 1920s after the start of Prohibition.  And until the 70s-80s the expected was 10% but the average was a bit lower.  The 15% standard started in the 70s after federal laws changed.  15%-20% today is still the most common range.", "I'll never get this American thing of the tip in percentage! 20% is huge! Just means its you playing the waiter's wage instead of the employer! The client gets stuck with that, or the waiter gets stuck with a client that doesn't tip. Only the employer gets his no matter what.", "It\u2019s definitely been 15% some places - actually 10% and 15 was the high number. It was standard service is 10%, great service 15% where/when I grew up (I\u2019m only 32 but from a more rural/lcol area). Obviously cities are different but standard percentage isn\u2019t the same everywhere.", "And that is exactly right. I do street outreach, so I know a lot of addicts. I'm also chummy with about every dope dealer on this side of town. I can tell you for absolute certain that they will work with a person to clear a debt with the patience of Job sometimes, but the second they feel like someone is dodging them, it becomes game on.", "The Applebees worker is working just as harder and with a lower price point, 15% can be a few bucks. I always stop and think what their time was worth to me and tip at least that. $40'dinner - prob still worth $10-14.", "Yeah you\u2019re cheap. 20% is the standard now", "[removed]", "People not paying their share is as old as time.  Over 20 years ago I used to go out for drinks after work with a group of co-workers.  I always paid more than I drank, which was usually just two drinks since I had a train ride (not safe to be a woman alone and drunk on a train) then a 15 minute drive home.  \n\nAnyway, I had two drinks and I think a plate of fries that was shared.  I put in a $20.  At that time, my tab couldn't have even come up to $15 for 2 rum & cokes and a $5 plate of fries.  Well, someone wasn't paying enough and even with people paying more than their share, it wasn't enough to cover the tab!  We stopped doing a tab after that.", "This is not a friend.", "Because it\u2019s custom to tip *servers*, including bartenders.  Follow local customs.  What\u2019s goofy and obnoxious is tip jars at Starbucks or the electronic iPad payment systems asking for a tip at Chipotle.  I\u2019m not going down an assembly line and tipping them like a server.  I\u2019m not tipping the beer man at a baseball game for the $17 beer he just sold me.", "No I\u2019m not. I said \u201cwhere I grew up\u201d, not where I live now, and that wasn\u2019t considered cheap by anyone there including the waitresses, many of whom I was friends with in high school. Literally how is following local standards and expectations in any way cheap or dickish? \n\nI regularly tip over 20% where I live now (a more expensive area) but that irrelevant to the point.", "He's also correct. Never is a long time. When I was young, it was common to tip 5% and 10% if service was great. Acknowledging that, and acknowledging that tipping values depend on the area and general culture, doesn't make one cheap or a dick. \n\nBut, you do you.", "They will notice if the employee starts quiting.", "If you can\u2019t tip, don\u2019t eat out."]}
