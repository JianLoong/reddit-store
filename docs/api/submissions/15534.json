I am a server/bartender and far and away the most common way to do this is separate checks for each person or couple. Maybe one of ten groups will rotate who pays the entire bill. Very, very rarely do groups ask the entire amount to be split 8 (or however many) ways. What a source of anxiety that would be to me to not know a budget for my outing.", "NTA. \n\nSeveral years ago, a three of my fellow alumni and I took 4 students out for a networking dinner. It was solidly a mid-level place - around $50 -70 per person plus tax and tip. The idea was that we\u2019d split the check 4 ways. I mentally estimated $150 -$175 per alum and was approved to put the meal on my company card as a marketing expense. We all worked in a similar field and had a similar income. \n\nThe meal was lovely. The students were friendly. Two of the alumni ordered heavier, as is always the case - think cocktails, appetizers, entrees, and desserts. While most people shared apps and desserts and skipped the cocktails. Whatever. Not a huge deal. \n\nBut then the check came. One of the guys announced that he \u201cowed\u201d the other guy dinner, so the entire check would be split 3 ways. Not only was the check higher because they were having the rest of us subsidize but they had planned ahead of time that we\u2019d be fully subsidizing the meal. Each share was close to $250 with tax and tip. \n\nThe FINAL STRAW was later that night the guy that paid zero dollars made a self-congratulatory social media post about how he was \u201cpaying it forward\u201d by treating students to dinner. This was 4 years ago and I haven\u2019t spoken to either of them since.", "NTA.

Most of my friends and I just split the bill when we go out, sometimes one person isn't drinking/doesn't order as much as the others but that changes each time and so it all evens out. That's not the case here, your check is always cheaper than theirs. If you were to just split the bill then every single time you all go out you'd be partially paying for their food, and that's just not fair longterm. \n\nAaron needs to mind his own business. Honestly it sounds like he over ordered because he assumed the bill would be split and it would work out in his favor, and then threw a tantrum when you didn't want to foot the bill which is just pathetic of him.", "NTA. I would expect an apology from Aaron, he wouldn't be welcome till he apologizes.  It's not your problem Aaron is a cheapskate. It's not you, it's him.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nMy friend group used to all ask for a single bill, we'd figure out what each of us individually got, and 1 friend would pay, and everyone would send them money for their amount. Everyone would tell him their amount with tip, add it all together, and then he would add whatever his was at the end. Many of us tended to tip pretty generously or just to make rounding easier. A $42 bill just became $50 with tip for ease.\n\nThis would result in some nights, the tip being upwards of $150 or more. The bill would come, and he would add whatever extra as tip amount. So, a $600 bill between everyone would be $750 or more.\n\nThis was all fine for a while, until we caught him just putting in 15% tip, and pocketing everything else that we sent him. Everyone had sent him a total of like $650 that night, the total bill was only around $450, with 15% tip he paid like $520, and tried to pocket $130.\n\nWe don't hang out with him anymore for that, and other reasons.", "NTA. I love separating the bill. I have allergies and I also drink more. So it\u2019s only fair that I pay for mine.

If you order top shelf most expensive drink, or 4 drinks or multiple foods, then you are eating on your own dime.  \n\nWe do not finance your meal for you.  \n\nIf you don't like this agreement, then you order first next time, and we will run the bill up on you.  \n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nI don't drink and some friends will order non stop cocktails and then expect to split the bill.  \nThankfully some of my good friends really feel this is unfair so they always make sure either the bill is split or the alcohol section is left out of the splitting.\n\nNot sure if it is a thing in other countries, but Australia really embraced QR code ordering during the Pandemic and that is so much better in every way.", "NTA. Alcohol is expensive, food restrictions are a pain to deal with that some people don\u2019t understand (I have allergies and I also don\u2019t drink).", "NTA, this isn't like paying a couple bucks extra by splitting the bill evenly. This like paying for an extra meal in difference.", "NTA. I guess he failed to realize what your friends apparently do...that if you always pay more than what your food costs that you'd soon quit joining them for meals.", "We had similar friends. We went out on New Year's Eve with them. We kept the waitress running for extra drinks, etc.  They drank more than us, but it was New Year's Eve, so my husband looked at the bill, split it 50%, added a 20% tip, and handed our friends the bill. The husband looked at the bill and added enough money to even the cash out to the bill's total minus any tip.  My husband was furious, but he worked with the husband so he added more money so the waitress would get the 20% tip.  We never went out to eat with them again.", "If someone else is paying, unless they say it's okay to order more, I stick to one mixed drink and then switch to water. If I'm paying my own bill, I can order whatever.", "Your wife is epic", "NTA and I love your wife\u2019s answer.", "Your wife is a legend", "When the waiter comes over you tell them separate checks.", "lovely burn, although it lost some potency by not being delivered on the spot.", "Why didn\u2019t the friend(s) put him in his place is what I\u2019m wondering.", "IF being the operative word; if I brought someone to dinner with my friends and they acted like that, they would be gone from my life that night!\n\nNTA OP", "Exactly. I don\u2019t like the whole concept of splitting a check evenly because you always end up subsidizing someone else\u2019s meal. I always get a separate check. One time a friend of a friend noticed I got a separate check and called me cheap for only paying for what I ordered. I said to her that making the rest of the group split the cost for her 4 drinks, entree, and dessert when everyone else ordered less than her seems pretty cheap to me.", "A friend did something above and beyond for me and I wanted to treat her and her husband to dinner. My husband said, \"Great, but I'm not telling them until the check arrives.\" We all dined and at the end of the meal, my husband said, One check please,\" and motioned that he was taking it. The other husband said, \"If I'd have known that I would have ordered another appetizer and a couple more drinks.\" My husband shot me his \"Called it!\" face.", "When we're out in a group, everyone pays their own way and usually someone volunteers to take this or that shared appetizer. Usually whoever ordered it and shared it", "Even if OP's total only came to $1 less, anyone who stands up in a restaurant to shout and verbally abuse someone else is totally uncouth. \n\nOne would hope that OP's friend has the sense not to date this person again. If he would scream at a stranger in a public place like this, she has to see how he would eventually treat her.", "Ordering a shit ton of food and drinks expecting other people to help pay for your total makes you a greedy, selfish jackass.", "That's the maddening part, they actively call someone else the cheapskate while expecting (and in OP's example - demanding) a subsidy. As always, the accusation is the confession. \n\nOP, NTA. I hope Aaron revealing his character gets him dumped. If not, I wouldn't go out with a group with him in it again. He's too yelly and demanding.", "That's somehow worse in my mind, I'm not sure why.  I guess because it feels very deliberate, as opposed to the \"let's just split because it's easier\" ignorant mindset.", "That\u2019s horrible! Trying to stiff a tip tells you so much about the type of person they are.", "i avoid even splits all the time. As my name suggests, i do like my food and dont want to feel guilty about eating more than my share, or go hungry. pay for what i eat just works", "Sounds like Aaron ordered more than he usually would bc the more ppl who split the bill, the less he pays for his items!", "Also, shouldn't the one bringing him into the group be the one defending OP? That part is throwing me off, why didn't her friend interfere and call Aaron out?", "Because embarrassing a man can have bad consequences later.", "Exactly this,  I always have a separate check. I am NOT subsidizing your alcohol intake when I don't drink.", "I don't even get the concept to be honest. It's not like it makes life any easier for the server either, basically everyone I know who worked as a bartender or server enters everything as split by default and then just combines them at the end of requested.", "I once took a friend out to celebrate get her masters degree. Once she found out I was paying, she ordered dessert. To go.", "That\u2019s why I stick to pubs where you walk up to the counter and pay, though usually one of us will buy a bowl of chips to share and another something else.", "This is exactly what we do. I don\u2019t understand people who split the bills evenly.", "And then there are those who pay \"their share\" but neglect tax and tip entirely.\n\nI remember the day I ordered fries and a beer and ended up paying almost $30 even though others at the table had put in \"their share.\"", "Yikes.\n\nWell please rest assured you did not do anything wrong. He made an AH of himself. Hopefully your friend sees that and moves in from him soon.", "It's a huge red flag that he got that aggressive over you paying your bill. (I think NTA honestly, but he definitely is). I hope your friend really thinks about his actions and if she really wants to be with a guy like that.", "Answer your friends \u2665 Don't let this tool Aaron ruin your relationships. He's the a-hole not you or them.", "I am petty and would link this thread to the group chat. But that\u2019s probably nuke-y", "Get on the group chat. These are your friends, they are going to tell you what they really think, and what they think of Aaron. Give them the benefit of the doubt before jumping to conclusions. NTA", "Was the group at large just sitting quietly while he popped off with a tantrum?? Wtf?? Nobody else told him to stfu and stood up for you? Or did he just ignore any efforts to make him act like a civilized adult and stop embarrassing himself?", "Please know that this whole blow up could be his method of isolating your friend from her support group.  Honestly, I would proceed as if she is in am abusive relationship.\n\nThis means you should encourage everyone to let her know they support her no matter what and that she can always talk to them (without telling her she should leave him or implying he is abusive).  Try to invite her to events without him (like girls night or one on one), just to feel her out and share your concerns.\n\nHis gross overreaction and willingness to create a scene with all of her friends, has likely embarrassed her greatly.  An abuser will do this sort of thing. \n\nI know that it was hurtful and embarrassing to you (you did nothing wrong and just reading about it made my heart race), but I'm really worried about your friend.", "If he does that in public, I'd hate to see how he acts behind closed doors. I hope he's not a boyfriend for much longer.", "Let his gf and your other friends know that you aren\u2019t comfortable with Aaron and will be skipping any dinners where he is included.  I\u2019m guessing they all feel the same way as you. He was so over the top out of control. Splitting the bill where one person doesn\u2019t drink sucks, so your way makes total sense.", "See, I'm petty enough to lurk on the group chat for the possible fall out. Did Aaron have enough to cover their share? Did the rest of the group have to cover for him? I would be very disappointed if your friends took Aaron's side and would have to rethink the friendships.", "NTA. Damn, I\u2019m sorry this guy came out of no where and made you feel uncomfortable. I don\u2019t see any reason for him to be so enraged by you receiving a separate check. The fact he was raising his voice and standing up in a restaurant over this non-issue is probably indicative of bigger problems he has as a person.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong about bill splitting, but since only Aaron was the asshole and everyone else has been on your side, it\u2019s kind of a jerk move to ignore them and pout", "You have nothing to feel awful about. He was a complete asshole and that's on him, not you. Move on and keep doing you because at the end of the day you'll see that he probably won't be welcome in your friend group again.", "My guy, you've been subsidizing big business your whole life. Stop watching Fox and inserting your Thanksgiving Uncle rants into a story about splitting the bill at a restaurant", "What the fuck is wrong with you?  How are you such a fragile snowflake that you find it important to insert your political opinion in a completely unrelated conversation?", "Bad bot.", "Do the math on our case. We had put down our half plus 10%. Let\u2019s pretend the bill was $100. We put down $60. The husband added $40. So he is getting $10 off their bill and not putting any money towards the tip. My husband added another $20 so the waitress got her tip. So we were our $80. They were out $40. Plus they drank a heck of a lot more.", "In our case, they weren\u2019t just stiffing the tip, but only paying 30% of the bill and no tip. We wound up paying 70% of the total bill plus the 20% tip.", "He was embarrassing himself.", "Yup, I don\u2019t drink and I\u2019m not paying for your three bottles of wine when I had a cup of tea with my meal.", "That's cold. That'd also be the last celebration meal from me. It's not the money, it's treating me like an ATM that I can't abide.", "We have some couples we'll go to dinner with where we just trade off; our treat this time, theirs next, and it's the ones who picked the restaurant who pay. It lets people pick restaurants they can afford and not feel uncomfortable, and lets the folks who want to treat people to places they wouldn't try otherwise. We've got folks from lots of different careers in our friend group. But that only works in very small groups. If it's a crowd, we go someplace affordable and everyone pays their way.", "I hope alarm bells were going off for the girl.  This is over the top and his poor behavior here is likely just the tip of the iceberg.", "I think you're right on the money here.  This sounds like a manufactured conflict to isolate his victim from her friends/support.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Oh this makes sense!
