Now I'm going to be upfront and say I'm pregnant (24 weeks) and I can't tell if my frustration is due to my pregnancy-mixed with the heat. \n\nBut anyways, the deal was that she was going just pitch in $400 for food cost for the house and then she uses her food stamps to purchase her and her family whatever extra food they want. We eat most meals together so this agreement originally worked. And to be clear, my husband and I are still purchasing almost $700 worth of food, even with her contribution, because they eat a shit load more than we do. I find myself cooking meals that would easily feed my entire family for 3 days in one night. \n\nThe only issue is food, if I'm being honest. Their daughter will come home and immediately raid my cupboards and eat all the food/snacks that I purchased specifically for my own children (dietary restrictions due to medical issues). I try not to make a fuss about it because it's just food but their daughter is eating my youngest son's comfort food (he has Autism) and they never replenish it so he will want his one comfort food and I will go to get it, just to find it gone. Queue meltdowns and me having to run out to the store in a heat wave, pregnant with a cranky toddler. I've asked my SIL to stop allowing her kid to eat it but she always says \"oh I didn't see her grab it\" or \"I don't think she's the one who ate it, I didn't see her with it\". Well, yesterday her kid get off the bus and immediately grab the last of my son's food and run to her room with it, where my SIL was and start eating it right in front of her mom, who said nothing. I was watching from the door and said \"this is exactly what I'm talking about. You guys aren't allowed to eat our food anymore. You have food stamps.

NTA", "As someone whos an older sister of a child with autism, NTA. her comfort food is ramen noodles, and if we dont have them on deck 24/7 i know how bad it can get.

They're taking advantage of you.", "NTA. How is telling a 12 year old she can't eat one specific thing going to cause food insecurities? My daughter knew at 4 that if she was told some food or drink was for a certain person that she had to ask me or her dad if she could have some. \nI would tell your SIL that, if it's not a big deal, the next time the food is gone and your son has a meltdown, SHE can go out and get it.", "NTA. They should be responsible for their own food.", "Nta. Does your husband know about this?", "NTA your SIL sounds entitled and unappreciative. It's not your responsibility to feed her daughter, and if the ONE thing you ask is for her to not eat your autistic child's comfort food and they can't even do that... Well, they wouldn't be staying in my house any longer.", "NTA \n\nSIL knew her daughter was taking the snacks. Niece knew she wasn't supposed to get them, but still did. SIL can buyband prepare their own food now.", "NTA.  You need to get something you can lock for your food.  She is old enough to know better.  She is also old enough to understand that her family is in dire straits financially, on food stamps, her family has been displaced and are living in someone else's household.  That is a lot of stress for a kid.  She is probably eating her feelings.  That does not mean you need to supply them with snacks, but it might give you some insight that she is not in the best position either.  You really need to have a talk with SIL when the kids are not around.", "nta. but not enough info here...why are they staying with you guys?

Clearly your sister feels it's acceptable to basically double dip. She gets her food for her family AND your food for your neurodivergent child/children with medical needs. It's not like they can go snack on something else if they have specific dietary restrictions.", "NTA.\n\nIf it's \"not that big of a deal\" then your SIL can shut her face and replace what her kid ate. Since it's \"not that big of a deal\" she get get off her ass and do it right now.

No reason both you and the SIL could have told her certain foods are off limits and then showed her which foods she could have. It\u2019s also possible if they were food insecure before that this child is binging due to an unconscious concern that she may go without again in the future. \n\nNTA but I think there are some easy workable ways around this. For instance, make the normal portions for your family plus three of the same size portions for them. If they are still hungry SIL can provide more food with her money. Store food available to all kids in one place and special snacks elsewhere while they are living with you. Have a conversation with the 12 year old yourself and then again with SIL in the room. No need to tip toe around it", "NTA. You set boundaries. They need to respect them", "NTA! You have an autistic kid that likes and needs their routines and stability. It is a big deal dealing with a houseful of people, a toddler, another family, increased bills, your own husband and being pregnant. Tell your husband you all need to come to a decision about how long this dynamic is going to last and let them know they have 3 months to find someplace else to live. You'll soon have a newborn, a toddler and 2 whole families there with one taking full advantage of living with you all. Nope, time to lay down the boundaries. and an end date! NTA!.", "NTA. You have limited money for food and sil has her own funds to pay for food.\n\n\nAt this point she is taking advantage of your kindness.", "NTA\n\nBut I think your SIL might be committing fraud re the the SNAP benefits, since she is eating your food as well as her own. You would be considered one family rather than two, so her benefits would be calculated on all income in the household. But that\u2019s a state determination.\n\nGive SIL and her family specific cabinet and refrigerator space. And let them cook and clean up after themselves. That way they can show they are a separate \u201chousehold\u201d even though they are crashing at your place.\n\nBTW, it is not unusual for a 12 year old to come home from school hungry. It takes a lot of energy to grow. Though the girl is crossing boundaries and she knows it.", "NTA Sounds like you not only wound up paying far more for their food than for yours but that the daughter is eating up everything else you have in the house. They need to be kicked out and I'm against sharing food expenses, it always leads to arguments, everyone should buy their own food, no mixing.\n\n>I try not to make a fuss about it because it's just food\n\nWhat do you mean \"just food?\" Can't live without it, if you're not going to put your foot down over food then over what would you?\n\n>Her daughter immediately starts crying because she felt she was in trouble (I didn't speak to the kid, just my SIL) and now she's down my throat about \"causing food insecurities when it's not that big of a deal\".\n\nThe daughter has no discipline because SiL never disciplines her. Kick them out.", "Hey, OP, I'm gonna say NTA on this one.\n\nIt's super frustrating when someone keeps eating your food without permission, especially when it's food that's specifically for your own kids. Like, seriously, that's not cool. You've already talked to your SIL about it, but she hasn't done anything to stop her daughter from eating your stuff. That's just not right.\n\nYou and your husband are being totally generous by letting them stay with you and even pitching in for food costs. But it seems like their contribution isn't cutting it, and you're still spending a ton on food for the whole fam. And on top of that, you're dealing with your own pregnancy and a cranky toddler.\n\nSo when you saw the daughter taking the last of your son's comfort food right in front of your SIL, you had every right to speak up. You set boundaries and told them they can't eat your food anymore. And let's be real, that's totally fair. They have food stamps, so they can buy their own damn food!\n\nIt's not your fault that the daughter started crying. Your SIL needs to step up as a parent and deal with the situation. You're not causing food insecurities; you're just standing up for your own family's needs. You gotta protect your kids, especially your son with Autism who relies on that comfort food.  \n\n\nEdit: I'm a teenager, Not a scholar. So I rewrote it to sound like I usually speak.", "NTA.  It is a good thing that the thinks that \" it's not that big of a deal\" when niece takes stuff, because that means it will not be a big deal when she doesn't get to take stuff any more.  \n\nThe only one that is \"causing food insecurity\" is your SIL.  She isn't providing snacks for her child. I am sure your niece will feel the most secure if she has a stash of her own.  Maybe buy a locking container for your child in his room, and another tote container for your niece to have the stuff her mom fills it with.", "NTA honestly I\u2019d have kicked them out.", "NTA but also put a lock in the cupboard.\n\nFood I insecurity is likely why they eT so much.\n\nThey should also go yo food shelves", "NTA\n\nno big deal \u2260\u00a0it's too expensive\n\nSIL needs a CTJ explanation", "NTA you can buy beefaroni at dollar general for gods sake, if she can\u2019t afford that what is she spending her money on.", "NTA, get a food lockbox and call it a day.", "NTA but you should kick them out.", "NTA it is a big deal. Those snack are specifically for your son.  You need to show them the door", "NTA. \n\nSounds like you need to lock up your food. It\u2019s sad it\u2019s coming to that, but it doesn\u2019t sound like your SIL intends to make any changes.", "NTA, I have read about many people installing a lockbox for certain items when the people they are living with are not considerate or sensible.", "ESH. You should have taken your sister aside and talked. Not in front the kids. You made the kid cry so YTA there. Your sister clearly an AH. I can't really blame the kid other than she's hungry. They are obviously struggling. Cutting them off completely IDK that would make you more of an AH but it might be necessary. You can factor in a more aggressive response due to pregnancy. You're basically nesting and part of nesting is cleaning house.", "Ugh \u2026 this is a mess. Why are they staying with you? \n\neveryone is the asshole? Kids cry so that\u2019s okay but starving kids is not, but it is also not on you too fed them?.. but you allow them to stay there, so it is kind of  on you to feed them\u2026?  defending your kids comfort and food preferences is fine but yelling is not.. Sil is taking advantage for sure. There\u2019s so much going on here !!!\nGood luck with your living situation.. it sounds like a nightmare. I feel for you all.\n\nEdit: spelling error", "ESH, but more so your SIL.  I'd say it's a 80/20 split with SIL as TA.\n\nI only say you're a bit in the wrong here because *that's a 12 year old girl.*  I'm sure she's already sensitive about food and her weight.  She might be using food to deal with problems at school, the fact that her family was just made homeless (in many states in the US, families like your SIL's are considered homeless, even if they've got a roof over their head).  Still, a child that age can be reasoned with. It can be explained to her that she can have food, just not THIS SPECIFIC food, and why.  SIL chooses not to do those things, I guess she doesn't want to tell her kid \"no\" after they've been uprooted like that.  It might not be an easy conversation, but really, all this needs is a conversation between SIL and her daughter. It's up to her to control her child.\n\nI'd just drop it and get a lock box for your son's snacks.  But I'm petty, so I'd leave it out where SIL can see it.  Like, right on the kitchen counter, in plain view. A clear, thick lock box with an impenetrable lock that only you and hubby have a key to.   Then it is made absolutely, 100% clear, without words, that this food is off limits.  You don't have the key?  You don't get to eat it.  Done. Get something else.\n\nYou don't mention it, but... if three people are eating more than FIVE\\* combined?  Something's really, really wrong there.  That's not healthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*edit, five one of whom is a PREGNANT WOMAN, who needs to eat more than she normally does!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
