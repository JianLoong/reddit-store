Collar and somewhat trained so he was someone's buddy. I found him on a Sunday so the only place open that day I could take him to check for a chip was a pet store. No chip. Called to some shelters that Monday and they were full so I tried to keep him while I looked for the owners so he'd have a good chance.\n\nPut up some flyers and made postings to local lost and found pet groups online. I had to turn my garage into a dog room for him since I had no idea about his health and home training and all I saw of his temperament so far was he was fine with humans but as the trip to the pet store showed, aggressive toward other animals. I had to walk him in the front of the house since I have bun buns in an enclosure in my backyard. I was only able to house him for a week because he dang near ripped the side screen door of the garage off trying to get out when people walked their dogs by my house and he'd get quite loud.\n\nI tried to see if anyone else in the neighborhood could house him but nope. I wound up taking him to a shelter between our town and the next since it wasn't full.\n\nLast week I got a call from a guy who saw the postings and said it was his dog. I asked to verify and he had pics of him and his family with the dog. From what he said, they had gone on an extended vacation and the 17y/o of one of his friends was being paid to dog/house sit and she got too scared to tell anyone she lost the dog during a walk so they were just now finding out he was missing. I told him which shelter I took the dog to. Later that day the same guy called back cussing me out and demanding I pay him the cost of the dog and the upset its caused him and his family because the pup had been put down after a couple of weeks there. Said I was sorry for his loss but he needs to take the issue up with the kid and her family since she didn't say anything until they got home.\n\nI know I'm in the clear legally but my gf and parents are of the mind I should pay because I dropped the dog off, and I should try to empathize with how stressful it must've been for a 17y/o kid and she probably has enough to worry about without adding paying back a grieving family.\n\n\\*\\*If all you're going to do is message me to tell me what a horrid person I am for taking the dog to the shelter- then please by all means fork over your own resources and time to open 2-3 no-kill shelters in every county across the country. It'd be ideal if there were more no-kill shelters with infinite space for all the furbabies out there, but that's not reality.

It's easier to lash out at a stranger than a family friend.", "NTA, you shouldn't try to underst anyone. All people who tell you otherwise are free to step up and pay to save the 17 y/o who had no brain to report the missing dog, nor to search for it.\nAlso, you should be compensated for the screen door, food and other things you provided, if we talk compensation.\n\nNow, realistically speaking, you did all you could. And frankly, I wonder why family never asked for pics of their beloved dog while vacationing to find out sooner.

Most people would have done nothing, or just dropped it off at the shelter. Sad case of no good deed goes unpunished, if you hadn't bothered with the flyers they would have never known what happened to the dog.", "NTA. You did what you could. The child is old enough to know you don't neglect telling someone about losing their dog for several weeks that is actually ridiculous.", "NTA \nYou went above and beyond, the paid dogsitter is the A here.", "No, you're absolutely NTA and you don't owe this guy a penny. His dog was lost and scared, and you took it into your home to care for it and keep it safe. When no owner appeared *after you did your due diligence to find one*, you took it to the shelter.

I think a lot of people would've taken him to a shelter right away instead of housing a strange dog.  Maybe it was a fast kill shelter or maybe the dog acted out so bad they had to put it down, but whatever. It's sad but not your fault and you owe them nothing.", "NTA. This is a terrible situation, but you did the best you could which was already above and beyond. If anything, the kid who lost the dog owes the family AND you money for what they caused.", "NTA\u2026 weeks?!?!", "NTA - You put in a valiant effort to find the owners. Shelters are the next best step. This owner is clearly upset that he will need to explain this to the family. You're absolutely right that the friend is the one at fault here. You did nothing wrong, and if I were the owners, I would be thanking you for taking care of my pet while I was unable to.", "NTA at all. Let him go after the dog sitter who was supposed to watch him and her family. Sad situation but you did nothing wrong.", "NTA, you did exactly as you were supposed to do, how they can come after you for money, other than avarice, is beyond me?", "So the teen who lost the dog didn\u2019t come around and look, ask, read the fliers?  log onto the web looking for the dog she lost? Didn\u2019t tell the owners for teo/three weeks?!", "NTA and you went above and beyond to try and get this random, unknown dog to its owners. They want money for some reason? Ridiculous. No wonder that dog ran away.", "WTF, did the guy think you were just supposed to keep a strange, sometimes-aggressive dog, for a month? NTA", "NTA. If he had chipped his dog or tagged the collar then he'd have been reunited straight away. Any compensation owed is from the dog sitter. You did everything correctly in terms of finding and trying to rehome a found dog", "NTA. Geez, even if the dogsitter was afraid to tell the owners, they could have LOOKED for the dog and called shelters, avoiding the worst.", "NTA\n\nYou owe nothing.

Looking at a MA shelter rn that costs $500 for any adult dog vs one in NC that costs $95.\n\n\\[ETA: dog owner is clearly the jerkwad here; just saying dog may not have been cheap regardless of purebred status).", "Further, states/counties usually have very specific timelines for how much \"grace\" period a dog gets (time for an owner to claim + time up for adoption if not claimed), and those timelines are often in days, not months. Time to claim might be as little as 2-3 days. If anything, OP gave the dog \\*more\\* time(chance) than it would have otherwise gotten.", "Holy hello Satan lol", "Most people on this thread are totally fine with killing a perfectly healthy dog (OP did not mention the dog being terminally ill). Don\u2019t worry about the downvotes. Most people don\u2019t place a lot of value on animals\u2019 lives. It\u2019s sad. You don\u2019t want to be liked by people like that anyway. Like, if a murderer doesn\u2019t like me, that\u2019s a good thing \u263a\ufe0f same here.", "No we aren't okay with killing dogs... you're being down voted for your make believe. There is truly no such thing as a no-kill shelter. The ones that claim they are no-kill do also have to put animals down due many reasons. Also you need to have your eyes checked because OP made numerous comments explaining that there are no-kill shelters near them and the ones they called were full... Please see an eye doctor.", "I don\u2019t even care about the downvotes on this post. You all are ok with killing dogs. I am more than ok with being disliked by anyone that would take a dog to a shelter where they would be put down. I don\u2019t want to be liked by people like that.", "What was the alternative?", "What kind of dog?", "> But, I think you suck too, because did you try to research no-kill shelters?? I can\u2019t believe shelters that kill animals even still exist. Surely there must have been another option available??\n\nNo-kill shelters are very very difficult to get a dog into, as they're usually full. There just aren't enough of them.", "Exactly \ud83d\udcaf", "Far more likely that someone would have just called animal control and it would have had the exact same outcome, just a week sooner than it did.", "What kind of cartoon, Leave it to Beaver-ass world do you live in?", "Or it would have been hit by a car and died slowly in pain instead of simply being put to sleep.", "If you ever find a  dog again and it looks to be a specific breed just know you can contact  a rescue group. A lot of times it doesn't even have to be a pure breed. They will take the dog in and foster it while they try to rehome it for someone looking for a particular breed. I don't know where you live but I found this one online for Texas. [https://austinboxerrescue.com/](https://austinboxerrescue.com/)   That way  if an owner does come forward  you can  give the info  of the group and they will at least  let the owners know if they still have it  or that it was rehomed.", "Not to mention that part of the reason animals are euthanized in kill shelters due to overcrowding is because of the stigma around kill shelters. If people went to the local county based/funded and adopted there, they'd have more resources for the animals that end up staying longer and wouldn't have to put down as many animals.\n\nIdk if I worded that well because I'm tired, but another thing people don't seem to realize is that no-kill shelters are usually private facilities that can refuse animals for any reason and will prosecute people for dropping them off without going through their approval process. I've had to surrender cats abandoned by a family member and only had private cat shelters nearby. It was an absolute fucking nightmare trying to get them out of the house because like 5 separate shelters refused because of capacity or not wanting a bonded pair because they're harder to adopt.", "So you're comparing OP to a murderer?", "Will do.", "Or the dog could have been hit by a car, or not be able to make it on the streets bc it's been too domesticated, or attacked someone else's dog and caused serious injury to itself and/or the other dog which could have resulted in it being put down anyway. Like, yeah, no one likes shelters that aren't no-kill ones, but there's really no way to guarantee that a stray dog-especially an aggressive one-with have any better chance in the wild.", "Yes?", "People like you are ridiculous. OP didn't kill this dog. They tried their best to find the owners. Blame the US shelter system for allowing kill shelters in the first place.", "If OP is a murderer, then you are too because your inaction for shelter animals got them put down. You could have banded other women together to sell nudes on OnlyFans to raise the funds necessary to open more no-kill shelters. OP did what he could, which is better than nothing.", "Ok", "Will put together the group. Thanks for the idea."]}
