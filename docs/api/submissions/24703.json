{"id": 24703, "submission_id": "15rwxdd", "title": "AITA for not compensating a family for their lost dog?", "selftext": "Last month I found a dog huddled up in the corner between my house and my backyard fence.  Collar and somewhat trained so he was someone's buddy. I found him on a Sunday so the only place open that day I could take him to check for a chip was a pet store. No chip. Called to some shelters that Monday and they were full so I tried to keep him while I looked for the owners so he'd have a good chance.\n\nPut up some flyers and made postings to local lost and found pet groups online. I had to turn my garage into a dog room for him since I had no idea about his health and home training and all I saw of his temperament so far was he was fine with humans but as the trip to the pet store showed, aggressive toward other animals. I had to walk him in the front of the house since I have bun buns in an enclosure in my backyard. I was only able to house him for a week because he dang near ripped the side screen door of the garage off trying to get out when people walked their dogs by my house and he'd get quite loud. \n\nI tried to see if anyone else in the neighborhood could house him but nope. I wound up taking him to a shelter between our town and the next since it wasn't full. \n\nLast week I got a call from a guy who saw the postings and said it was his dog. I asked to verify and he had pics of him and his family with the dog. From what he said, they had gone on an extended vacation and the 17y/o of one of his friends was being paid to dog/house sit and she got too scared to tell anyone she lost the dog during a walk so they were just now finding out he was missing. I told him which shelter I took the dog to. Later that day the same guy called back cussing me out and demanding I pay him the cost of the dog and the upset its caused him and his family because the pup had been put down after a couple of weeks there. Said I was sorry for his loss but he needs to take the issue up with the kid and her family since she didn't say anything until they got home.\n\nI know I'm in the clear legally but my gf and parents are of the mind I should pay because I dropped the dog off, and I should try to empathize with how stressful it must've been for a 17y/o kid and she probably has enough to worry about without adding paying back a grieving family.", "created_utc": 1692115714, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rwxdd/aita_for_not_compensating_a_family_for_their_lost/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't owe anyone anything.  You tried to help an aggressive dog.  They should have boarded the dog while they were away.", "NTA\n\nYou tried.\n\nThey should have had the dog chipped.", "Not the asshole. You did what you could; you didn\u2019t take on the mantle of dog ownership.", "Was the dog a purebred or something? Understandable that the owner would be upset about his dog being killed, but kind of weird that he would demand payment. Maybe that's his way of expressing his hurt and frustration... but it isn't your fault and you absolutely should not feel obligated to PAY for being a good samaritan!\n\nAt any rate, it sounds like you did everything in your power to help the dog and find the owner. The dog ought to have been chipped, and the dog-sitter should have COMMUNICATED with the owner when she lost the dog. That would have avoided this whole situation and most likely resulted in the dog being returned safe and sound.\n\nYou are NTA!", "I think you're right,it should fall on the person who was responsible of taking care of the dog while the family was away, regardless of how the teen may have felt about informing the family, they failed to take accountability, you did all you could until you couldn't, they're TAH. I'd just block them, you've said your piece they refuse to understand,just end communication you have no moral obligation to pay them for their dog.", "NTA If this is going to be an issue with your GF maybe  you should rethink the relationship. She is supposed to have your back and seeing as she knows you tried your best to find the owners she really should have your back.  Also... Aren't there any No Kill shelters in your area?  I would have been calling around or checking online  for one even if I had to drive an hour or two  to get to one.  What breed was the dog?", "No good deed goes unpunished. NTA", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s lashing out because he doesn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s at fault here for trusting someone incapable and a child. His negligence is what brought upon the demise of his dog. Poor pupper.", "NTA\n\nYou did your best.\n\nThis is why I have a \u201clost cat\u201d flyer ready to be printed at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nThis is why, when I travel, I inform animal control, and give them my cat\u2019s chip number.\n\nThis is also why I prefer to use a trusted cattery rather than a pet sitter when I have to be away.", "NTA. You gave this dog a home for a whole week and did your best to find the owners. That's above and beyond what many people would have done. What happened was unfortunate, but it wasn't your fault. How long were you supposed to wait?", "NTA. It's bizarre that they're asking you to compensate them for the loss of their dog when you aren't the person who lost it. You tried to do the right thing, whereas their dog-sitter did exactly the wrong thing--she was irresponsible and stupid, and as a result this poor dog has been put down. I wouldn't have an ounce of empathy for that kid. If she had said something the family might've gotten their dog back and 17 is old enough to know better.", "NTA - your GF and parents on the other hand, have no logic whatsoever.", "YTA - Only because you took the dog to a kill shelter. If I were to surrender a dog to a shelter, it would be to a no-kill shelter. I am sure those are harder to find available as they are fuller, but I simply could not live with myself taking a dog to a place they could be put down. That\u2019s probably what the guy was upset over. That you took the dog to the slaughter house.", "NTA What a tragedy for the family but the responsibility for the lost dog lies squarely with  dogsitter. She lost the dog. She failed to report the lost dog to animal control.\n\nYou found the dog. Checked to see if it was chipped and found a shelter to accept the dog. The family is upset but their anger is misplaced. It's easier to lash out at a stranger than a family friend.", "NTA, you shouldn't try to underst anyone. All people who tell you otherwise are free to step up and pay to save the 17 y/o who had no brain to report the missing dog, nor to search for it.\nAlso, you should be compensated for the screen door, food and other things you provided, if we talk compensation.\n\nNow, realistically speaking, you did all you could. And frankly, I wonder why family never asked for pics of their beloved dog while vacationing to find out sooner. Plus they probably tried to save some buck by hiring a 17 y/o instead of a proper dog sitter.\n\nTo top it up, shelters are full of dogs needing home, they can simply adopt, without paying breaders", "NTA You tried your best to provide for a dog that wasn't your own. You tried to find its owners for over a week. What else were you supposed to do. I doubt you knew what would happen to the dog not long after you took it to the shelter. It ls a shitty situation, and I feel bad for the owners, for they lost a family member. The teen watching the dog should be the one held responsible for not calling the owners, and the owners should take responsibility for having a teen watch a dog, who I'm sure is known for not being trained properly.", "  \nNTA. But tell your GF and her parents that if they give you a hard time, they will be next. And they know you will....", "NTA as far as handling things with the family - expenses like that are not your responsibility. But, imho, you are 100% TA for knowingly taking the dog to a kill shelter. That\u2019s just abhorrent behavior to me.", "NTA. By \"grieving family\" I think you actually mean \"irresponsible pet owners\".", "NTA, what is with this timeline? Even if that dogsitter lost the dog within a day of them leaving, and you found it the same day, that still leaves several weeks (one at yours + shelter). Either the dogsitter had been lying about the dog the whole time (and they are the AH), or the owner didn't care enough to check in on their dog for over a month (and they are both the AH). \n\nYou went above and beyond. Most people would have done nothing, or just dropped it off at the shelter. Sad case of no good deed goes unpunished, if you hadn't bothered with the flyers they would have never known what happened to the dog.", "NTA. You did what you could. The child is old enough to know you don't neglect telling someone about losing their dog for several weeks that is actually ridiculous.", "NTA \nYou went above and beyond, the paid dogsitter is the A here.", "No, you're absolutely NTA and you don't owe this guy a penny. His dog was lost and scared, and you took it into your home to care for it and keep it safe. When no owner appeared *after you did your due diligence to find one*, you took it to the shelter. You were the epitome of a responsible pet finder. \n\nAnd I hope he learns now that when you lose control of your pet, you lose control of the outcome.", "You knew it was someone's dog and you took it to a kill shelter? Not a no-kill shelter?", "NTA. \n\nIf it weren\u2019t for you they never would\u2019ve known what happened to their dog, and it just as easily could have died on the streets somewhere. You gave him a much better chance than he had without you, it just unfortunately didn\u2019t work out.", "NTA, you did a lot more than most people would've done for the dog.  I think a lot of people would've taken him to a shelter right away instead of housing a strange dog.  Maybe it was a fast kill shelter or maybe the dog acted out so bad they had to put it down, but whatever. It's sad but not your fault and you owe them nothing.", "NTA. This is a terrible situation, but you did the best you could which was already above and beyond. If anything, the kid who lost the dog owes the family AND you money for what they caused.", "NTA\u2026 weeks?!?!", "NTA - You put in a valiant effort to find the owners. Shelters are the next best step. This owner is clearly upset that he will need to explain this to the family. You're absolutely right that the friend is the one at fault here. You did nothing wrong, and if I were the owners, I would be thanking you for taking care of my pet while I was unable to.", "NTA at all. Let him go after the dog sitter who was supposed to watch him and her family. Sad situation but you did nothing wrong.", "NTA, you did exactly as you were supposed to do, how they can come after you for money, other than avarice, is beyond me?", "So the teen who lost the dog didn\u2019t come around and look, ask, read the fliers?  log onto the web looking for the dog she lost? Didn\u2019t tell the owners for teo/three weeks?!", "NTA and you went above and beyond to try and get this random, unknown dog to its owners. They want money for some reason? Ridiculous. No wonder that dog ran away.", "WTF, did the guy think you were just supposed to keep a strange, sometimes-aggressive dog, for a month? NTA", "NTA. If he had chipped his dog or tagged the collar then he'd have been reunited straight away. Any compensation owed is from the dog sitter. You did everything correctly in terms of finding and trying to rehome a found dog", "NTA. Geez, even if the dogsitter was afraid to tell the owners, they could have LOOKED for the dog and called shelters, avoiding the worst.", "NTA\n\nYou owe nothing. You did everything you could for this dog, which was more that a reasonable stranger could be expected to do. As you say, this is between the dog owner and the delinquent pet sitter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He should have had his dog chipped and properly tagged with readable tel number and collar \n\nYou kept the dog for A WEEK! Advertising you\u2019d found him to before taking to a shelter. Dog was found abandoned. \n\nThat\u2019s more than I\u2019d have done, I\u2019d have kept dog overnight,  then off to shelter in the morning. \n\nSad it turned out to be a shelter that puts dogs down if not claimed after a few weeks, but that\u2019s local legislation perfectly legal and not your responsibility. \n\nHe should have kept in touch with dog sitter or picked a more responsible one . He cheapest out both in not chipping nor paying for proper dog care. \n\nYou can be sympathetic but you did everything more than right. I\u2019d block the errant owner now if I were you", "Right?!
