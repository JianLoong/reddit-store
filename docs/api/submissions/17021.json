{"id": 17021, "submission_id": "13f6zt9", "title": "AITA for not wanting my child to meet his father\u2019s new Girlfriend?", "selftext": "So for context; Me and my son\u2019s father broke up for about a year. We lived together, were civil and practically roommates. He decided to kick me out due to \u201cno girl will talk or do anything\u201d with him as I lived there.  Three days after kicking me out (knowing I would take our child with me) he moved his new girlfriend in. He and this girl have only known each other for two weeks and dating for maybe a week at the time. (It\u2019s only been one week since now so that brings us to three weeks.) He wanted our Son to meet her, and I expressed that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable or wanted him around her due to how short of time he has known her. He has since flipped out on me, calling me childish and that I\u2019m trying to use our son as a tactic against him and trying to keep him from seeing him. That he will do what he wants and that our child will meet her. Also to clear up any confusion as well I asked him if she could leave the house for him to go there or to meet somewhere so he could see him/play with him.\n\nEdit: Our child is 6. I had an apartment lined up and was going to move out but he begged me to stay living with him, so I decided to not sign the lease. After kicking me, I do have my contacts and I have my own place. Not using him for anything. I have full sole and physical custody of our child. He does not have visitation, I just choose to let them see each other for the sake of our child. About 7 months of being separated I started to talk to someone (nothing serious and this person lives out of state) he flipped out on me for not trying to make our relationship work and just deciding to talk to someone else, and how he would never date anyone else and he\u2019s just going to focus on him self and his child because he doesn\u2019t want to ever introduce anyone to our child. Also for context the person I started speaking to never met my child, and never talked to my child. My child doesn\u2019t know they even exist. (We don\u2019t talk anymore) He had only known her to this day for three weeks, moved her from 2.5 hours away and didn\u2019t tell me. She was only supposed to stay the weekend. He sees his son every day (or use to) I always try to make it a point for them to be together and spend time together. I just don\u2019t feel safe with the little amount of time that he has known her. If they were dating for a couple months or something I would feel more comfortable about it. I did end up letting him introduce him to her, but I still just don\u2019t feel like it was a smart idea. Especially when he was doing the drop off, his girlfriend got out of the car and starting swearing and yelling at me in front of our child due to the conversation me and his father was having. (The conversation did not have anything to do with her.)", "created_utc": 1683856053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13f6zt9/aita_for_not_wanting_my_child_to_meet_his_fathers/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is better for children to not have a revolving door of people in and out of their lives, so I fully agree with your point of view. However, you are going to have no control over what your ex does during his parental time.", "NTA. Protect your kid and wait for things to stabilize before letting the dad introduce him to a new girlfriend. Three weeks is way too soon.", "Less than a month? NTA.", "NTA. He shouldn't be (not should you) be introducing your kids to romantic partners until it is very serious.  Nohngood to have all kinds of people coming into and disappearing from the kids lives.", "If you haven't already done so, I urge you to get a custody agreement in place. This is a complicated situation. I'd be unhappy if my ex was introducing our child to people he'd only been dating a few weeks. But ultimately, you can't stop him from doing it. A custody agreement could provide parameters you both have to abide by and a route to pursue if it's violated", "NTA he sounds insane", "NTA. The fact that she acted that way, in front of and at you, and your son. Speaks volumes. And if he's still with her *after the fact* he has no respect for you or your son.", "Edit: 6 is definitely old enough to have an impact. Definitely NTA to want to keep them from meeting this early. \n\nInfo: how old is your child? Depending on the age it could little effect or could be extremely confusing for the kid. Assuming they are of an age where it could be confusing, I'd say NTA as that is way to short a relationship to be introducing outside partners to a child.", "If you have sole custody and he technically doesn't have visitation as per your arrangement, NTA. But, if this arrangement is on paper, start adhering to it. Letting him see your son gives him a chance in court.", "Info:  What is your custody agreement?", "NTA, and if you haven't done it already you should file in family court for custody. You can actually request that no significant other (yours or his) can meet the child for x amount of time. \n\nIt's super damaging for kids to have random people coming in and out of their lives and at 3 weeks there's not any kind of real foundation in a relationship to be thinking about meeting someone's kid. I personally wouldn't feel comfortable with anything less than 6 months.\n\n\n\nEdit: just realized you obviously did file in court if you have full custody. You can definitely petition for them to add in a clause about new partners.", "Depends on the custody arrangement. If he has custody, he gets to decide who is around during his time. If you have sole custody, you do. If there isn't a formal arrangement, you need to make one.", "NTA, but he's correct in a legal sense. He can see his child and have his child around others, including a girlfriend. Is he being AH by moving so swiftly and not regarding his kid? Yes. He's still entitled to his child and he can have the woman around.", "INFO Is your issue the length of time they have been dating? I do know some couples who don\u2019t introduce relationships to their kids until it is a certain time frame, just to lessen confusion. Do you think if you were dating someone a few weeks your child\u2019s father would feel the same? I mean if it is a planned agreement ( and maybe you both need to discuss this) it would be an unwritten rule. I want to edit this saying, you shouldn\u2019t use anything to prevent him from seeing your son. I do think you should discuss new relationships and arrangements and meetings with your son. Probably should have been done before now, TBH", "That\u2019s a super short time. I think you\u2019re right for not wanting it. But YTA if you keep pushing. It sucks but he has every right to introduce them.", "INFO 1. Need some more context on the kicking out like what was the exact reason he gave, what was the agreement of your cohabitation, what kind of safety net(friends, family, etc) you\u2019re using and did he know you have them available, and lastly what incited the (just a hunch) confrontation/conversation that made him say get out.\n\nAbsolutely go see about a legal agreement for custody. The sooner the better.", "This is a legal question.  If he has visitation rights, he can introduce his GF.", "He\u2019s an AH.\n\nBut, is it possible he was lying to you about not wanting to date anyone else? For all you know he\u2019s been dating this girl without you knowing.", "Info: why in the world did you procreate with this guy?\nThis all could have been avoided if you had exercised some reasonable judgment.", "ESH- you have zero say in what happens in your ex\u2019s time with your son. If you want a say, then you need a court order. \n\nDo I agree with introducing a girlfriend at this stage? I don\u2019t. But that is not the point.

That\u2019s just facts about divorced life.  You have to let that one go.\nHowever moving in a new girlfriend 30 seconds later is confusing for a child, and letting her swear at his mom in front of him is even worse.\nYou guys got to figure out how to be grown ups for the sake of your child.", "NMI but probably YTA. Did he kick you out with nowhere to go? Because if not, it sounds like you're trying to vilify him for not wanting to live with his ex, which you shouldn't have wanted either. \n\nThis leads me to you being the asshole. Neither of you would really be able to have any healthy relationship living together but now that he's moved on, you don't want the new girl to meet your son. Honestly, he's probably known her for awhile and told you it was recent so you wouldn't feel bad as you two were cohabitating at the time. \n\nRegardless, you trusted him as a parent while living with him so that trust shouldn't change just because he has a new gf. At what point are you comfortable with his live-in partner meeting your child? 3 months? 5 months? a year? And are you willing to abide by his rules when you decide to move on? Have you made any efforts or requests to meet this partner?", "YTA. Sounds like you've been using him for whatever support you wanted despite no longer wanting a relationship with him, and now he's moved on you are using the child as a weapon.", "YTA for leaving you child there when the father\u2019s gf was swearing and yelling.  You should have put your child back in the car and left. Not a safe situation", "ESH. I don't like where this is going. It looks like the war games have already begun and the kid is the nuke. None of this will end good for the kid.", "I don't know that YTA but it's not good to keep him from his child because you feel it's too early for your kid to meet the girlfriend. Relationships move at different speeds and if they live together already then you are keeping him from his kid for no reason other than their relationship is short. Maybe ask to meet her and spend some time with her yourself first considering there is a kid involved.", "Its understandable that you are uncertain about your son meeting this girl, but you have no say in the matter.\n\nHe let you live there for a year after you two broke up (assuming it\u2019s his place) and he didn\u2019t raise a custody issue.  That sounds like a half way decent guy.\n\nYTA if you are keeping your son from seeing his father.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Does he have scheduled visitation or do you just let him see your son whenever? If there is no scheduled visitation, I would make it a rule that he come to your home to see his son with supervised visitation only and she be nowhere near your home.", "NTA.  The girlfriend is overstepping by inserting herself into your business with the ex.  The ex is letting her.  If her reaction us to get out of the car and start cursing...I'd think twice about wanting my child around a psycho who can't keep it together.", "Some girl after 3 weeks to meet a six year old who already has split up parents.....NTA at all.", "NTA", "NTA. You have full custody, he doesn't even have visitation. You have been accomodating until now, think that needd to stop as he clearly isn't interested in doing what's best for your son.", "NTA, but its clear she is going to be a problem and i would not be doing him any favours.", "A woman who behaves like that in front of a child probably should not be around that child.", "NTA and it sounds like your intuition was right. She started yelling and cussing at you in front of the kid? Considering you have full physical and legal custody i would let him know that the situation where she started yelling was not ok and that you don\u2019t want your kid to be around her. And also that if he wants to see the kid he can do so but without her around and if he decides to  go against that boundary then you won\u2019t allow him to see your kid.\n\nIf it causes issues he can take it up with the court. Moving in after a week together is already a huge red flag and if he\u2019s too blind to recognize the red flags even when told then you need to put your foot down for the sake of your child", "NTA.  The standard wisdom says not to introduce new partners to the kids until it's clear it will be a stable relationship, not just some fling.  I learned it from my mom,  I learned it from my parenting while divorced class I had to take,  and I have heard it oh, everywhere.  It's good advice for the safety and emotional well being of the kids.  \n\nIf you don't have a custody agreement, I suggest you get one,  and have a clause in it about introducing new partners,  and having them spend the night when the kid is over.  Apply it to both of you.   You might also ask if there's a coparenting  class you both could take.  This is important.  It's worth learning to do well.", "If he only gets the time she allows it\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be a problem.

Though she isn\u2019t going to keep the child away from the dad.\n\nMost states actually frown upon and can deny the child being introduced to a new partner for a certain period of time. \n\nIe they have to prove they have been dating for at least 3 months before the child can be introduced. This stops a revolving door of S/Os being in the kids life.", "Op has take into consideration the fact that this woman jumped out of her car and started cursing her out because of the situation.  If the gf didn't show that she was a raving lunatic that would be different. In my opinion her actions showed exactly why OP wants Dad to have time with his child without the gf.", "Not if he doesn\u2019t have joint custody or visitation stipulated in a legal document. It sounds like she has sole custody, and visitation was at her discretion, nothing legally binding", ">Also to clear up any confusion as well I asked him if she could leave the house for him to go there or to meet somewhere so he could see him/play with him.\n\nOP offers alternatives that allow the father to spend time with the child without introducing the girlfriend yet, so I don't think she's trying to prevent him from seeing their son.\n\nBut I agree that they should discuss boundaries regarding new relationships, meetings and other arrangements ASAP.", "Please see OP's edit. She didn't keep pushing it, she allowed for them to meet, but after the stunt the new GF pulled, maybe OP should have insisted on them not meeting yet.", "Yeah, because people like OP\u2019s ex never hide who they really are at the beginning of the relationship do they? It\u2019s not like you only ever see a different side of a person after a breakup is it?

I think that\u2019s just something a lot of people put out in order to avoid any accountability \n\n\nPeople are who they are; their behavior is going to come out when they want it to or not.

However much she may not like it, OP has zero say in who the father introduces the boy to.  That\u2019s the adjustment you need to make when you coparent with an ex.", "She does have a choice.  She has sole custody", "Sounds like dad would need to go to court for custody first.", "It's not odd for co parents to meet eachothers significant others before introducing children. It's even written into a lot of custody agreements.", "An agreement can be made that new partners should not be introduced to the child before an established amount of time - this agreement would be valid for both parents.\n\nAs for your last sentence, I did have to make adjustments to coparenting with my ex. Hard calls.   \nThere was a whole string of very short termed girlfriends right after the divorce. My ex wanted to spend weekends at their places and take our boy with him. It only happened once and I put my foot down: no more taking our boy to sleepovers at his \"flavor of the week\" homes. If he wanted to spend the night with them, he would have to either bring our son back home or take him to visit his parents.\n\nAnd before anyone dares to say I was overstepping or trying to alienate father/son, I never prevented them from spending time together. I was simply against my son having sleepovers at the house of women his own father didn't know that well. \n\nThe proof I was right on having this stance? Months later after my ex had already moved away to be with the woman he ended up marrying, one of those short term girlfriends was still trying to insert herself in my son's life, by leaving him notes and little presents at the coffeeshop near my parents' house, because she \"felt such a bond with the kid!\"", "Does she? I didn't see that. If that's the case, she could get a behavioral order that defines what is acceptable and what is not. Tough call.", "They both need to be going through custody court for the sake of the child. Don't get me wrong, the dad is the AH here, but being realistic, no leg to stand on to keep the woman away unless she's violent or using drugs. Then you need an order."]}
