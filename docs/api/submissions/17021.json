{"id": 17021, "submission_id": "13f6zt9", "title": "AITA for not wanting my child to meet his father\u2019s new Girlfriend?", "selftext": "So for context; Me and my son\u2019s father broke up for about a year. We lived together, were civil and practically roommates. He decided to kick me out due to \u201cno girl will talk or do anything\u201d with him as I lived there.  Three days after kicking me out (knowing I would take our child with me) he moved his new girlfriend in. He and this girl have only known each other for two weeks and dating for maybe a week at the time. (It\u2019s only been one week since now so that brings us to three weeks.) He wanted our Son to meet her, and I expressed that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable or wanted him around her due to how short of time he has known her. He has since flipped out on me, calling me childish and that I\u2019m trying to use our son as a tactic against him and trying to keep him from seeing him. That he will do what he wants and that our child will meet her. Also to clear up any confusion as well I asked him if she could leave the house for him to go there or to meet somewhere so he could see him/play with him.\n\nEdit: Our child is 6. I had an apartment lined up and was going to move out but he begged me to stay living with him, so I decided to not sign the lease. After kicking me, I do have my contacts and I have my own place. Not using him for anything. I have full sole and physical custody of our child. He does not have visitation, I just choose to let them see each other for the sake of our child. About 7 months of being separated I started to talk to someone (nothing serious and this person lives out of state) he flipped out on me for not trying to make our relationship work and just deciding to talk to someone else, and how he would never date anyone else and he\u2019s just going to focus on him self and his child because he doesn\u2019t want to ever introduce anyone to our child. Also for context the person I started speaking to never met my child, and never talked to my child. My child doesn\u2019t know they even exist. (We don\u2019t talk anymore) He had only known her to this day for three weeks, moved her from 2.5 hours away and didn\u2019t tell me. She was only supposed to stay the weekend. He sees his son every day (or use to) I always try to make it a point for them to be together and spend time together. I just don\u2019t feel safe with the little amount of time that he has known her. If they were dating for a couple months or something I would feel more comfortable about it. I did end up letting him introduce him to her, but I still just don\u2019t feel like it was a smart idea. Especially when he was doing the drop off, his girlfriend got out of the car and starting swearing and yelling at me in front of our child due to the conversation me and his father was having. (The conversation did not have anything to do with her.)", "created_utc": 1683856053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13f6zt9/aita_for_not_wanting_my_child_to_meet_his_fathers/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a complicated situation. I'd be unhappy if my ex was introducing our child to people he'd only been dating a few weeks. But ultimately, you can't stop him from doing it. A custody agreement could provide parameters you both have to abide by and a route to pursue if it's violated", "NTA he sounds insane", "NTA.

Definitely NTA to want to keep them from meeting this early. \n\nInfo: how old is your child? Depending on the age it could little effect or could be extremely confusing for the kid.

You can actually request that no significant other (yours or his) can meet the child for x amount of time. \n\nIt's super damaging for kids to have random people coming in and out of their lives and at 3 weeks there's not any kind of real foundation in a relationship to be thinking about meeting someone's kid. I personally wouldn't feel comfortable with anything less than 6 months.\n\n\n\nEdit: just realized you obviously did file in court if you have full custody. You can definitely petition for them to add in a clause about new partners.", "Depends on the custody arrangement. If he has custody, he gets to decide who is around during his time. If you have sole custody, you do. If there isn't a formal arrangement, you need to make one.", "NTA, but he's correct in a legal sense.

I do know some couples who don\u2019t introduce relationships to their kids until it is a certain time frame, just to lessen confusion. Do you think if you were dating someone a few weeks your child\u2019s father would feel the same? I mean if it is a planned agreement ( and maybe you both need to discuss this) it would be an unwritten rule. I want to edit this saying, you shouldn\u2019t use anything to prevent him from seeing your son. I do think you should discuss new relationships and arrangements and meetings with your son.

Neither of you would really be able to have any healthy relationship living together but now that he's moved on, you don't want the new girl to meet your son.

Relationships move at different speeds and if they live together already then you are keeping him from his kid for no reason other than their relationship is short. Maybe ask to meet her and spend some time with her yourself first considering there is a kid involved.", "Its understandable that you are uncertain about your son meeting this girl, but you have no say in the matter.\n\nHe let you live there for a year after you two broke up (assuming it\u2019s his place) and he didn\u2019t raise a custody issue.

She started yelling and cussing at you in front of the kid? Considering you have full physical and legal custody i would let him know that the situation where she started yelling was not ok and that you don\u2019t want your kid to be around her. And also that if he wants to see the kid he can do so but without her around and if he decides to  go against that boundary then you won\u2019t allow him to see your kid.\n\nIf it causes issues he can take it up with the court.

The standard wisdom says not to introduce new partners to the kids until it's clear it will be a stable relationship, not just some fling.  I learned it from my mom,  I learned it from my parenting while divorced class I had to take,  and I have heard it oh, everywhere.  It's good advice for the safety and emotional well being of the kids.  \n\nIf you don't have a custody agreement, I suggest you get one,  and have a clause in it about introducing new partners,  and having them spend the night when the kid is over.

However much she may not like it, OP has zero say in who the father introduces the boy to.  That\u2019s the adjustment you need to make when you coparent with an ex.", "She does have a choice.  She has sole custody", "Sounds like dad would need to go to court for custody first.", "It's not odd for co parents to meet eachothers significant others before introducing children. It's even written into a lot of custody agreements.", "An agreement can be made that new partners should not be introduced to the child before an established amount of time - this agreement would be valid for both parents.\n\nAs for your last sentence, I did have to make adjustments to coparenting with my ex. Hard calls.   \nThere was a whole string of very short termed girlfriends right after the divorce. My ex wanted to spend weekends at their places and take our boy with him. It only happened once and I put my foot down: no more taking our boy to sleepovers at his \"flavor of the week\" homes. If he wanted to spend the night with them, he would have to either bring our son back home or take him to visit his parents.\n\nAnd before anyone dares to say I was overstepping or trying to alienate father/son, I never prevented them from spending time together. I was simply against my son having sleepovers at the house of women his own father didn't know that well. \n\nThe proof I was right on having this stance? Months later after my ex had already moved away to be with the woman he ended up marrying, one of those short term girlfriends was still trying to insert herself in my son's life, by leaving him notes and little presents at the coffeeshop near my parents' house, because she \"felt such a bond with the kid!\"", "Does she? I didn't see that. If that's the case, she could get a behavioral order that defines what is acceptable and what is not. Tough call.", "They both need to be going through custody court for the sake of the child.

Your child comes first, and you are doing the right thing", "Considering she has sole custody I don't think that's an issue.", "Since she has sole custody with no visitation, no she\u2019s not overstepping.", "Does she? Op is claiming that up until three weeks ago, they lived together. Outside of some sort of abuse situation, how exactly would she have gotten sole custody with no visitation rights in three weeks?", "She moved out three weeks ago and you buy that she has sole custody with zero visitation rights for the father that fast?", "It sounds like it has been in place for awhile, not just the last three weeks. OP expressly states that she lets the father see the child since he is the father. In her post she says \u201che sees his son every day (or use to)\u201d which indicates that she allowed him to visit with his kid (when they lived together) even though he did not and does not have any visitation rights to the kid.", "Yes. They broke up a year ago. That's more than enough time to have come to agreements on custody and visitation", "That makes no sense.", "And she lived with him full time until three weeks ago, as I said. So you think she was able to get a court to sign off on zero custody and zero visitation rights for the father that fast without some sort of extenuating circumstance?", "Can I clarify anything? I got all of this from the wording used by OP and how she chose to display things. It\u2019s not uncommon (at least where I live) to put in custody arrangements like this at the beginning of a child\u2019s life but then not adhere to them later if both parents can compromise and collaborate together on a better alternative for the child. It just sounds and seems like OP had to go back to the original arrangement because the father is proposing a potential dangerous environment/situation for their child.", "Not in 3 weeks but he may have been willing to agree to that arrangement before she moved out. \n\nDepending on local laws, she may not have needed a court to sign off either. In Australia it can all be done between parents, courts are only involved if they can't agree. So here, if he agreed for her to take the kid fill time, it would be on him to take her to court to get visitation when she refused and they wouldn't look kindly on his behaviour re the new gf and his unwillingness to compromise. He would still get contact but it would be with rules re who the child is allowed to be around and he could lose unsupervised access if he breaks those rules", "I honestly get the impression that these things were in place before these last three weeks, OP just never had to enforce them until now. It seems that way from the wording, at least.", "Does it sound to you like they agree on the parameters?", "Same. I would bet a lot of money that she has done most of the parenting for a really long time and he's only complaining now because he isn't getting his way despite not contributing to the day to day work of raising a child", "It sounds like he was more than willing to let her take all of the responsibility and is only now complaining because he also wants the privileges without having to contribute the work. \n\nHe wants it both ways - to have full parental rights with zero parental responsibility. It doesn't work like that. If he wants the right to make decisions that are widely advised against by professionals, the price of entry is minimum 50% parental responsibility.", "I definitely can see that point but I also find it kinda weird that the father wants to have his kid meet his girlfriend of three weeks so bad. It feels to me that he\u2019s wanting to use his kid to brag or something. It would be different if OP didn\u2019t let dad see the kid at all under any circumstances or dad was willing to see his kid without the new girlfriend being involved but that\u2019s definitely not the case here lol.", "NTA. You're not wrong; it's too soon.", "Opie's ex sounds unhinged, opie should always be there for the child", "He asked her to live there. She had another place lined up to go to when they broke up.", "No no no because the person could be an abuser in anyway you don\u2019t truly know someone until three  to five years into knowing them she nta she is definitely not over stepping anything."]}
