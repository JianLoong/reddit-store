They hooked up and now Lia is pregnant but Alex isn\u2019t happy about it. Alex and Lia have always been weirdly close but they\u2019ve never crossed the friendship line and clearly for good reason because the whole thing has been messy as hell since Lia told him she was pregnant. He asked her to get rid of it and she said no, so he asked her not to tell his family about the baby yet but she went ahead and told them.\n\nThe majority of our friendship group thinks she baby trapped him for money since her family don\u2019t have much and Alex\u2019s are more than comfortable. I originally was defending her but then while she was ranting to me about what a jackass Alex is, she said the only thing Alex would be good for was money and that her baby wouldn\u2019t need him as a father. She kept talking about Alex, money and him being an ATM for a good 30 minutes. \n\nThe conversation left a bad taste in my mouth so I was discussing it with Charlotte, my best friend and Alex\u2019s ex, and we both agreed that it seems like Lia only cares about the money and I said I was starting to agree with the friends who think she baby trapped him for money. Unfortunately, Charlotte mentioned it to a few other friends who told others and it\u2019s gotten back to Lia. She hasn\u2019t said a single thing to me and the only reason I know she now hates me is because Alex, of all people, confronted me about it and she blocked me.\n\nHe told me to leave Lia alone and tried to guilt me because she\u2019s pregnant and needs her friends right now but he\u2019s the one causing her the most stress. He said if I (or anyone else) said anything else about her we\u2019d have to deal with him so most people are now denying ever saying she baby trapped him so I feel like I\u2019m being thrown under the bus here. Charlotte said he\u2019s only playing hero because his family are all on his case now because Lia keeps running to them so he has no choice but to act like he cares.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704291589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xkh0i/aita_for_agreeing_that_my_former_friend_most/", "score": 1584, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lia doesn't want to have an abortion and that's a decision that should be respected.\n\nGoing to Alex's ex to discuss this was only going to create more drama. Chances are, Alex needs some time to digest this and work out what role he's going to play without the drama, and in your conversation with Lia she may have been feeling quite spiteful as she had experienced Alex ask her to get an abortion she doesn't want. That's a lot of emotions going around at once for both of them and pregnancy hormones can be literal hell. It doesn't excuse what she was saying, but is a worthwhile factor to consider.\n\nIt doesn't sound like there's any evidence of her actually trying to baby trap him. They could both have practiced safe sex (if they didn't, sometimes even when practicing safe sex these things happen). It just sounds like a lot of assumptions are being made at a time when emotions are running high. Charlotte's thoughts on his current behaviour are irrelevant because they are just assumptions.", "YTA. Stop calling Lia your friend because you are not a friend to her. Both Alex and Lia had consensual sex and are aware of the need for birth control. That's between the two of them. Alex is financially responsible for the baby and he knows that. That does not mean Lia baby trapped him, only that she expects child support for his child. You said nothing to Lia but then sneak around gossiping and spreading rumours with no actual knowledge. Now you are reaping the consequences of running your mouth and think you're the victim. Your friend group is finding out that you are no friend but a malicious gossip.", "ESH except for Alex and Lia. Look, you & your friends are absolutely causing stress and drama because instead of letting Alex and Lia figure things out, you're chatting about them, speculating and making accusations. \n\nI don't know if Lia babytrapped Alex, and from what you've written, neither do you. All we know is that she's pregnant and if Alex isn't willing to be a father, she's optimistic re financial support.\n\nAlex has stepped up to tell his 'friends' to quit gossiping and I think that was very mature of him.", "YTA. I'm dating a well off guy. I'm not planning to get pregnant but if I did I would be glad he had the means to support a family. That in itself is not evidence of \"baby trapping\". Alex presumably knows where babies come from.", "YTA. There's a lot of bad behavior here, but here's the key:\n\nLia told you that Alex was a jackass... in other words, she wants Alex to be a real father to her baby, but he's refusing. So she's convincing herself that she's better off. Whenever people are in shitty situations, they deal with it by looking for the positive (or making one up). Lia's talk doesn't mean she only wanted Alex for the money; it means she's taking what she can get.\n\nYou should have known that Lia wasn't gold-digging, and the consequences of spreading a false rumor fall on you.", "YTA. You were gossiping.", "Yes. YTA. If you don\u2019t have the backbone to tell Lia to her face that you think she\u2019s baby trapping Alex, then don\u2019t say it at all.", "YTA\n\nAlex knows what happens when you have sex without protection. \n\nAll you needed to do was stay out of it.

She\u2019s pregnant and her friend (the father) told her to get an abortion she wasn\u2019t interested in. She\u2019s not getting rich having his baby. Stop assuming because she grew up poor, she must\u2019ve banged her best friend to get rich off child support. Child support is a fraction of the cost of raising a human for 18 years. And of course Alex\u2019s ex is going to talk shit about her. \n\nYou\u2019re being a crap friend. Knock it off.", "YTA. Stop complicating the situation by gossiping.   \nThey have been close for years according to you. Things happen, she probably is reacting like this (money talk) because Alex isn't happy about the situation and Lia is trying to find a silver lining (atleast he has money even if he doesn't want to play happy families with me). They could easily end up together once Alex manages to process the situation.", "YTA. Did Alex remain unaware that he was having sex with her? Did she take advantage of him when he was cognitively unaware of the surroundings or situation?

Any child support Alex pays is not going to put Lia on easy street lol. Your friend is going through a difficult time and your idea of support is to talk about her behind her back?

You\u2019re gossiping about your friends and obviously relishing the drama and then act surprised when the actual people involved are mad at you and don\u2019t want to talk to you. Leave them alone to figure it out.\n\nAlso, how did she \u201cbaby trap\u201d him? Did she poke holes in the condoms or something, or lie about being on birth control? If not, and if they both just had consensual sex without using birth control, then he is also responsible for the baby. He wasn\u2019t tricked into anything.", "YTA. It's not your place to speculate on motivations. You (and the friend group) aren't Lia's judge and jury.

Did she lie about this? I know people say this isnt your business but i dont want to hang out with someone who would have done something like that. Its the female form of stealthing and i dont care if people disagree with tbat. Otherwise this isn't babytrapping. All in all, the biggest victim here is the baby. Already so much drama and the kid isn't even born yet", "YTA for not leaving them to sort it out themselves.

I don\u2019t really know why you have all inserted yourself into the situation and then proceeded to gossip about it. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s all fair and well everyone blaming Lia for baby trapping him, but did nobody ever teach Alex about wearing a condom?? He\u2019s a big boy that should know the consequences of unprotected sex.", "YTA. It takes two people to make a baby and only carries that burden for nine months.

Baby trapping can only really happen if birth control was tampered with. If he chose not to use a condom, then I have no sympathy whatsoever.

Also, she was venting to you after one of her long time friend\u2019s turned into a mutual HU \u2014 and resulted in pregnancy (which she has every right to decide on by herself), and was likely saying a bunch of things that she didn\u2019t mean, or possibly hasn\u2019t fully processed, because she was scared that he wasn\u2019t going to be a good father to the baby/be in its life if he was reacting so poorly, and just wanted to get it all out and make it seem like she was fine via hyper independence and \u201cATM\u201d analogies, and tbh, that\u2019s valid. They both knew what they consented to & where babies come from, and now they have to deal w the consequences \u2014 alex just didn\u2019t expect Lia to want to keep the child (but her reasoning for why is likely to be more personal/religious than it is for the \u201cmoney\u201d part). In other situations like that, when dads walk out or don\u2019t even wanna co-parent, almost everyone agreed they should pay child support, bc it takes two to tango! This situation is no different, and tbh it doesn\u2019t seem like either of them said anything about becoming a big happy family & fully merging finances \u2014 maybe coparenting is something they\u2019ll consider since this is so fresh. until there\u2019s a wedding \u2014 you won\u2019t know either, so mind your own neck until then. In situations like these, people confide bc they trust you & bc they just want you to listen as they talk themselves through it. You took the stuff she said in confidence & ran with it \u2014 to ppl like Alex\u2019s ex. I\u2019d learn to keep quiet or ignore everyone altogether if you want to avoid being blamed for gossip, because in this case (though you weren\u2019t the only one) you were definitely wrong and you\u2019re just upset bc you\u2019re the only one who got called out for it.

You aren't being thrown under the bus, you put yourself there. Accusing a woman of baby trapping someone is fucked up. You didn't express any of that to Lia, why? Because you knew it would hurt her feeling and is absolutely considered \"shit talking\". You need to apologize and have a real conversation with your friend or you are going to lose her.

Sounds like Alex is on his way to become a deadbeat father who is only good for providing money to his child. \n\nThese are the facts provided by you. Where in your post is Lia actually baby trapping Alex? Her body, her choice and he has to be made to care. \n\nYou basically told your friends Lia is a gold digger when all she wanted was support from the future father of her child, so yes, YTA.", "Of course YTA. You had a private conversation and went and told your best friend/Alex\u2019s ex the details of that conversation. Sounds like Charlotte is mad about the hook up bc she went and ran rampant with this information you also told her in private. Y\u2019all not friends for real.\n\nNext time, keep your opinions to yourself and learn to be a friend. Also, if a man asked me to get an abortion, I too would be mad. I would take that as he doesn\u2019t want to be in my child\u2019s life and would revel in the fact that he can at least financially support the child, especially if I\u2019m angry.

It sounds like Lia was talking to her friend trying to process that Alex isn\u2019t going to provide emotionally for his child and figuring out what he could provide. Babies are so dang expensive, and, as a single/solo mom, she\u2019s going to need help and support. If you think she\u2019s somehow going to make out financially, you have no idea how little child support actually covers, if he actually pays it. How did she \u201cbaby trap\u201d him? Did she sabotage their birth control method? No? Then she\u2019s just a scared pregnant woman trying to figure out how she\u2019s going to get through this.", "Baby trapping doesn't exist.

For talking about your friend to another friend behind her back after they confided in you during a high emotion time. \n\nIf they didn\u2019t want a baby they BOTH should have taken precautions.

Alex and Lia have always been weirdly close but they\u2019ve never crossed the friendship line and clearly for good reason because the whole thing has been messy as hell since Lia told him she was pregnant. He asked her to get rid of it and she said no, so he asked her not to tell his family about the baby yet but she went ahead and told them.\n\nThe majority of our friendship group thinks she baby trapped him for money since her family don\u2019t have much and Alex\u2019s are more than comfortable. I originally was defending her but then while she was ranting to me about what a jackass Alex is, she said the only thing Alex would be good for was money and that her baby wouldn\u2019t need him as a father. She kept talking about Alex, money and him being an ATM for a good 30 minutes. \n\nThe conversation left a bad taste in my mouth so I was discussing it with Charlotte, my best friend and Alex\u2019s ex, and we both agreed that it seems like Lia only cares about the money and I said I was starting to agree with the friends who think she baby trapped him for money. Unfortunately, Charlotte mentioned it to a few other friends who told others and it\u2019s gotten back to Lia. She hasn\u2019t said a single thing to me and the only reason I know she now hates me is because Alex, of all people, confronted me about it and she blocked me.\n\nHe told me to leave Lia alone and tried to guilt me because she\u2019s pregnant and needs her friends right now but he\u2019s the one causing her the most stress. He said if I (or anyone else) said anything else about her we\u2019d have to deal with him so most people are now denying ever saying she baby trapped him so I feel like I\u2019m being thrown under the bus here.

It makes you a lot more prone to yeast infections and can hurt you badly down there, especially if you turn out to be allergic.", "Even if your numbers are correct and they used all these options simultaneously, which would be highly uncommon - Do you know how high a 0.01% failure rate is?", "My mom got pregnant while using an IUD back when that was dangerous.", "Yeah with those odds Id definitely have tons of kids now!", "I mean if you google it there a bunch of sources but the CDC quotes a typical failure rate of 5-7% and their referenced studies in that same article show rates of 1-7%. And perfect use of a pill IS hard, hence my choice of 5% which is just below the 'typical failure rate', a reasonable assumption when considering  a situation where someone is 'doing everything they can to prevent pregnancy'. I used the lowest quoted failure rate for condoms because the bulk of 'condom failure' is not from manufacturer defect but because they are not used every single time. Someone who uses condoms half the time is considered a condom user, but anything short of 100% use every time you have sex is basically the same as 50/50, you only need to not use it once to have a baby.   \n[https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/index.htm#:\\~:text=A%20pill%20is%20taken%20at,use%20failure%20rate%3A%207%25](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/index.htm#:~:text=A%20pill%20is%20taken%20at,use%20failure%20rate%3A%207%25).  \nhttps://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms", "To be honest I don't know the specifics on this, I simply included it because the numbers show that condom + spermicide is more effective in preventing pregnancy than condom alone, appreciating every study will be more biased because people who are careful enough to use spermicide are probably more reliable at using condoms in the first place. I'm not saying spermicide is the right choice for people and doesn't carry risks, only saying that it would marginally decrease risk of pregnancy above and beyond condom alone.", "Yes, basic math tells me that the failure rate is 1 in 10,000\n\nMeaning it absolutely does happen as I assume more than 10,000 people have sex every single year. But the point of my comment was to say that ODDS suggest they WEREN'T doing everything in their power to prevent pregnancy, and that we don't need to just give them benefit of the doubt (as parent commenter suggested). It is fair to assume based on the numbers that a contributor to the pregnancy was that the contraception was not being used optimally (i.e. Plan B etc...) unless we are given information otherwise. \n\nPut another way - if we assume the two parties in question didn't do everything in their power to prevent pregnancy, we would be right 9,999 / 10,000 times.", "Some studies put the number of births from accidental/unintentional pregnancy between 40 and 50 percent. Lower in places where abortion is accessible.\n\nTypical usage of contraceptives is very different than ideal usage, and an astonishing number of people assume that because they don't want a pregnancy, one won't happen, even though they're having penetrative sex.", "You\u2019ve put a lot of effort into a moot point", "It's actually BOTH of their responsibilities. There is no victim here.", "Yeah I mean I both admire the effort to have to prove a point and also am like... 9,999 times out of a 10,000, fixating on pharmaceutical company stats to the point where you die on a reddit hill will prevent you from having sex, therefore preventing any and all risk of pregnancy or STD transmission."]}
