You can still tip in France and I believe most Americans do because it\u2019s ingrained into us. \n\nGermany it was a little different, it was customary to tip, but not as much as in America.

I've been all across Europe. Tipping is not normal unless they know you're American. Then they push.", "I'm from Germany. We do tip but it's way less than it seems to be in the US plus if you don't tip it's ok as well. Servers get at least the regular minimum wage, which of course is not huge but they are not dependend on tips. \n\nIndependent of tips the prices in the menu are with tax already so what you see is what you pay.", "For some reason, my husband and I thought that tipping culture was the same in Australia and tipped 20% all the way through.
