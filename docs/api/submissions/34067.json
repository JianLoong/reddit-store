Just wondering if there are additional cultural or geographic context that applies and is contributing to your mom\u2019s behavior.\n\n(My children have gone to both public and private Christian schools and can happily learn science and many other subjects and learn to decipher and reconcile opposing viewpoints.

I homeschool my kids and we are pretty dang rigorous on actual educational subjects while making sure there's still room to explore interests and also get out and meet other people and hang out with friends.

I'm sorry you're having to deal with this situation at such a young age and I hope you have a trusted adult in your life who can help you or start the process to get you help and also get your mom some help because it sounds like she may need someone to talk to about her anxiety.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I feel like I\u2019d be way better off if I set some boundaries for myself earlier. The fact that she tries to guilt trip you and that she grounded you for asking to go to school is a red flag. If you want to go to school it is crucial that you do it NOW. There\u2019s not much time left and you may be suffering from educational neglect.
