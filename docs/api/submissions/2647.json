If it were just you, you might be able to pull it off and everyone could eat with their neighbor's elbows up their nose. But three? The table size is the table size. They can't magic up more room.\n\nIdeally, you'd have three tables, since you're so sensitive about this. Old, middle, and young. But you can't just bring an extra table to someone else's house, require them to buy and store a table when there is enough seating at the ones which exist, or change the size of their house if three tables won't fit. \n\nSo you're being a bit dramatic. You can be upset and feel left out a bit, but your therapist being \"shocked\" made me roll my eyes. \n\nMy vote is that you eat where there is space (at the kiddie table) and then after dinner, you can wedge in at the adult table, or lure some people off to other seating arrangements, such as the living room couch, for grown up conversation. I actually enjoy sitting at the kiddie table. Kids are hilarious. I'm in my 30's and have none of my own. It's also a great excuse to just chill out and not do anything for a bit, since the older ones are talking, the younger ones are playing and I am having a brief respite before jumping back into the fray on either side. I'd also like to point out that if you feel neglected by the older people, then get attention from the younger ones. And! You can do all of this without being the babysitter and handing them back to their parents to deal with.\n\nAlso, why isn't your therapist helping you come up with ways to get the inclusion you want? That would be way more helpful than the pearl clutching. You could work on your relationship with these relatives outside of this once a year dinner, or plan to bring a game to play with the other adults, or establish boundaries on how much you watch the kids and effective ways to redirect them back at their parents. Something.\n\nETA You could try to low key campaign for a third table by dropping casual comments that the kiddie table is running out of space, and what will they do if you/ your siblings get married, or someone else has another kid, or wow, next oldest cousin is getting big! Having multiple people casually say stuff like \"with so many, we're going to need a third table soon!\" may eventually lead to a third table.

But get a card table some folding chairs and set you and your brother up!", "Lmao okay I'm not suggesting you do this but my sister hates kids. And what she does is she teaches them all the bad words she could think of. Kids love repeating that stuff. \n\nOne time she made them watch Happy Tree Friends on her phone - she was banned from watching the kids since then. \n\nNTA", "NTA and I\u2019m not trying to diminish your feelings but this sounds like your anxiety is making a mountain out of a mole his. As the resident family babysitter - I get it. It sucks, but the best way to go about this is to fix yourself a cocktail with your brother (because you\u2019re both adults now) and band together to have a good time. My family is big and most of my cousins are 10 years older with young kids but my sister and I made it our mission to have fun no matter where we sat.\n\nIn my family we were at the kids table until we were all in our 30s for the simple fact that there just wasn\u2019t enough room at the formal dining room table. We had to wait for people to die for seats to open up.", "NTA. How about going somewhere else with your brother this year?", "NTA. I believe they\u2019re doing it because you did a lot of babysitting and they think you wouldn\u2019t mind sitting next to the kids. Just tell them that it bothers you and that you would like to be seated at the adult table next time.\n\nLooking younger will come in handy when you hit 40. At that point you\u2019ll still have another 40 hears of good looking while everybody else starts therapy because they\u2019re aging.", "This year take your food and sit in the living room. If they comment, just point out there is no room for you at the adult table.", "NTA but just go and sit at the main table. What are they gonna do call the FBI on you?", "NTA.  You and brother should pass on the Christmas dinner.  That will send a message.", "NTA, if they are putting you at the kids table just don't go. Binge Netflix and eat bonbons!", "NTA. They could pull a folding table up to the end of the dining table to accommodate you, they just want you to keep being babysitters.  Hope you are able to demonstrate you're no longer fit for the role this year.", "NTA- I wish their was a judgement besides E S H and N A H, like No Winners Here (NWH). It is completely possible that your grandmother is telling the truth and there is literally no room at the table. In which case people should take turns sitting at the kids table rather than volunteering you and your brother every year.", "In my family we had to wait for someone to die to move to the adult table. Most of us were already in out twenties.", "Just tell mom you will be going elsewhere. NTA", "I would start a food fight.", "Take alcohol over to the kids table for the grown-ups they dump there (obviously don't ket the kids actually get their hands on it). I give it ten minutes before someone flips. NTA", "Uncle babysat once and taught my brother and I to shoot peas out of straws. He was allowed to babysit afterwards but not allowed to tech us new things.", "I like this, especially if OP smuggled in something like tattoo markers, face paint, or party poppers. Visual and auditory noise would be the name of the game, bonus if the party poppers gave a bit of smoky smell and they tried to hide it with the kids.", "And a puppy", ">the ones who were most bothered by this was me and my middle brother (20)\n\nSo, when you see the seating arrangement, make the \"adults\" uncomfortable. you and 20 year old brother take their spots at the grown up table. Just, sit down and dish yourself up. Let those who don't have seats sit with the children. Pull this twice and they will do away with the children's table.\n\nIf they pitch a fit, look at them and state \"Clearly Aunt X only wants a babysitter. I'm not playing games. I will not be sitting with the children and I will not be babysitting. I would like to visit with my family and if that is not an option brother 20 and I will be leaving.\" Then leave.\n\nIts okay to play hardball.", "I\u2019ve got the perfect game for stabbing each other - it\u2019s one my cousins and I played when we were at the kids table.  Everyone has a fork and there is one apple.  Someone throws the apple and another person catches it on their fork.  The person who caught it throws the apple AND the fork stuck into it for someone else to catch on their fork, so the next throw is an apple with two forks and so on.  Great family safe entertainment.", "And little toy drums!", "Tell the kids that the parents are getting them a puppy for Christmas, hype it up all night, then let the parents manage the ensuing shit storm!\n\nAlso, that might actually get them an obligation puppy if you play your cards right. Then, every time the parents get frustrated with all the effort and destruction that comes with having a puppy they can think \"we need a professional babysitter next time\".", "When I was organizing conferences at work, I gave all my deputies slide whistles or mini recorder whistles. I found them at a party store, multipacks for very reasonable prices. Maracas are classic. Put confetti and glitter in the gift bag to make sure it gets everywhere.", "Harmonicas or Kazoos are always a nice touch, and remain interesting to kids for longer than a one-note whistle.", "Pixie sticks", "Yes let the volcano erupt\ud83c\udf0b\ud83c\udf0b\ud83c\udf0b\ud83c\udf0b", "Direct at granny\u2019s dress! Or better: granny\u2019s glasses.", "Silly putty is a better option imo. I put some of the stuff in my pocket (without its little plastic egg) when I was a kid and, though my mother tried to get it out, eventually she had to admit defeat and throw the pants away.  Great stuff, silly putty.", "100% this.\n\nYou need to stand your ground. When Aunt says that simply look at her and state \"Just like you, I'm a grown ass adult (use the profane word). I will not be sitting at the children's table.\" If she gives you crap, poor yourself a nice solid glass of wine, ignore her and start talking to the other person next to you. Totally ignore Aunt. \n\nComport yourself with grace, class and a spine of steel.", "And very tiny confetti. That stuff stays hidden like forever."]}
