You f you are at the kids table then don\u2019t do anything to help them out. Of course you are out there to babysit.

At my husband's extended family, the main hostess has room for 8 at her dining table. The \"kids' table\" is made up of everyone under 45. The adults'table is people 60-99 years old. I don't take it personally because the upgrade from kids' table to adults' table is made when someone dies. \n\nBeing treated as childcare and babysitter instead of a guest is a bigger issue and you can stand up for yourself, and maybe this offense is being triggered by your appearance related issues makes the seating assignment untenable for you, but its pretty normal to have young adults still not at an adults' table.

Would you have more fun there? Anyways, you need to request to sit at the adult table before showing up. As soon as you walk in and see the table setup, ask where you are sitting.

Those relationships are the ones that\u2019ll be closer and longer lasting, and you probably already have more in common with them.\n\nDon\u2019t think of it as the kids table; think of it as the not old farts table. Do you really want to sit there and listen to them talk about Trump and Tucker Carlson\u2019s latest BS anyways?\n\nNTA, but I also think being at that table might not be as glorious as it sounds. You\u2019re an adult now and they all know it. A spot at a specific table doesn\u2019t really represent that.\n\nEdited to add: you can absolutely make it clear that you aren\u2019t babysitting their children just because you\u2019re there.

When she was told to sit at the childrens table, I got up and sat with her and the kids... me being around 45 at the time, her 19-20.

Bonus.. my wife and cousin joined us.", "While I don't realky understand the concept of a kids' table (sounds rather excluding), it's your family tradition. But to seat an adult with a bunch of kids? Who does that? Especially when younger adults are not afforded the same treatment. NTA, obviously.", "NTA \n\nI had once to SLEEP in one (big) room with all \"kids\" from my family. I mean my older sister (25), me (23), my 2 other sisters (20 and 16) and 3 cousins (16, 11 and 9).\n\nI did not take it well and was loud about it (and so were my 2 other sisters above 20). My other cousin (22) did get a room for himself and his girlfriend, so it was obvious that it has nothing to do with the age but because we were single. My uncle tried to improve the mood by telling us that he had very good memorys about him and his cousins sleeping in one room and having fun together when they were \"young\". Then I remembered him he was married with 23, so he should better not come with memorys from \"his youth\". He and my father had avoide the subject before so by the time we knew about the accomodation we were traped and could not go and find a hotel.\n\nWell it's the last time my father did that. We would just have not come back again without better accomodations.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t go if there wasn\u2019t a proper seat for me.", "NAH\nIn my family we also had a \"children table\". We got the better food there. :D It's not ok if they want to treat you like a babysitter. So it's totally fine to sit with the adults.\nBut yeah, my experience is (F30), that it's more boring to sit with the older relatives, so normally me and my cousins and siblings voluntary play with the smaller kids.\n\nBut maybe depends on the kids. Last family party (we were around 60ppl) my family rented a location but some staff was sick. The kids (age of 8-10y) voluntary brought the drinks and played waiter/waitress. That was great. :D", "Soft YTA for making such a big deal of it a year after\u2026 you have the right to be annoyed, and they have the right to still seat you there if that\u2019s what they have space for. If you really really don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t have to go. Or you can host holidays at your house eventually so you can make the rules. \n\nMy 2p: let it go and stop dwelling on the shortcomings of people and situations. I know that\u2019s something some therapist lead you to, and to an extent that awareness is useful as long as it leads to a change or resolution or acceptance. Stewing is most certainly not helpful and will just lead to more therapy sessions.", "INFO is there actually space at the table for you and brother?

I\u2019m in my early 40s and still sit at the kids\u2019 table. I even birthed 3 of the children at the kids\u2019 table.

I was soon not allowed to watch the kids", "Sorry, I always go to Thanksgiving in my head until after Thanksgiving passes.  Even though you said Christmas, it's like I have a mental block against thinking about christmas related stuff until after Thanksgiving passes.", "I agree. I also remember growing up, one side of the family did it mixed in, the other a children's table. I can tell you the children's table always resulted in a lot more problems than having children mixed in. And also resulted in a lot more things that the kids didn't want to eat being snuck to the dogs under the table.", "We usually have more than two tables, but they all sort of age/generation segregate just like this lol. \n\nWhen kids are really small they have to sit with their parents so no one else is having to help them eat. Then they get to sit with the other kids. The teens alternate between the younger adults and the kids, depending on how they feel that day lol. It\u2019s all just sort of age group/gap dependent, but, the parents all make sure no one is left \u2018babysitting\u2019 or feeling like a babysitter, unless they want to and are paid lol. \n\nIt sucks that OPs mom isn\u2019t helping with the babysitter issue. I have the oldest grandkids and sometimes they want to babysit a bit (for money) and sometimes they don\u2019t. I make sure they know they never have to, but then, so do my relatives with the younger kids.", "I appreciate this. You\u2019re a grown-up now and want to shift your attention to the grownups. Tell them that this is important to you when you want the time to connect with them and you\u2019re not interested in sitting with the kids.

Did you and your brother offer to move it?\n\nI think NAH. I think they see it as a space issue and you and your brother feels like you shouldn't have to sit at the other table. I'm guessing it's really young kids then you and your brother?", "I suggest water balloons or water guns. Teaching kids swear words is also fun.", "it's ok i understand, i celebrated thanksgiving when i live in the US and it was really fun, i can see why you guys are fond of that day.", "It is fun."]}
