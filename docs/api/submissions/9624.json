Except she still did her part on Saturday and Sunday morning, and she made food for us (she didn\u2019t eat much of it though) like normal. But Sunday night, when I asked what we were going to have for dinner, she said that she wasn\u2019t feeling well and didn\u2019t want to cook. No big deal! I figured she wasn\u2019t hungry, so I splurged and ordered myself something on DoorDash. When it got there, she asked if I had gotten her anything.

Thats your girlfriend. Who is also still paying rent and bills at her own place? I can overlook the thinking to ask her if she wanted anything but once you realizing she wanted something too you could have ordered her food too.", "\"I don\u2019t think I should have to pay to feed someone who is staying in my house.\"\n\nNot only do you see your gf as a guest, you're actually treating her worse than any decent host would treat a guest.", "Bro, by your own admission,  SHE is paying for 75% of the groceries that provide you with breakfast,  a packed lunch, and dinner. SHE'S paying for you to eat. \n\nThere's one person being taken advantage of in this scenario,  and it isn't you.", "This shit right here is the problem. She is not someone staying at your house, she\u2019s your girlfriend/partner. When you\u2019re in a committed relationship, you help one another and don\u2019t care if someone uses utilities at a normal amount unless you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nI\u2019ve been in this situation and it\u2019s borderline cruel. You\u2019re making her feel like she isn\u2019t worthy of your time or home, and that she\u2019s expected to do things for you.\n\nHonestly, if you have to be such a tight wad about money/potentially being taken advantage of (you\u2019re taking advantage of her btw), then start splitting all the food costs, share food/cooking duties, PACK YOUR OWN LUNCH, and find out the exact increase in utilities and ask her for that.\n\nYou want all of the reward, without giving anything beyond her staying at your home. I\u2019m so over this nothing is worth more than free rent mentality.", "Makes you think why u r with this girl when you don't have basic caring of giving someone you love food (especially when they r sick). You are taking advantage of her, getting free meals (I dont think her using ur utilities will be the same as her cooking and buying groceries). I hope she realises what an AH you are. \n\nWhy are so many people like this. Want a maid and sex and want to do nothing else for that person. Disgusting.", "But she\u2019s paying to feed you day in and day out??? And doing the work of actually making the food????!?!?\n\nEvery time you open your mouth it gets worse. I\u2019m so glad (and you\u2019re certainly lucky) I never have to see you in person.", "<3\n\nIt's not an original, but it's definitely applicable here!", "I\u2019m\u2026. A woman??", "Lol, comment straight out of r/seducingwomen", "She does pay her own rent and utilities but her utility cost is lower from not being at her place, and mine is higher", "I'm so shocked after him reading the comments, he still thinks what he did was OK.. what an idiot", "You don't understand. Mr. Special here has a partner to take care of HIS needs. Why would she ever deserve anything?", "okay and? would it have killed you to ask the person you\u2019re in a long term relationship if they\u2019re hungry?? you have to be dense if you think she\u2019s only hungry if she wants to cook and only deserves to be fed if she\u2019s feeding you. i\u2019m excited she won\u2019t have to deal with you much longer, you sound miserable", "But your grocery bill and takeout bill is lower?\u2026 YTA", "How much higher are they due to her being there? (You can't just look at the bills then and now, as bills have gone up in most places, so that would have to be taken into consideration). How much does she spend on food? \n\nWhy do you think that her paying her way at yours (by buying most of your groceries) means that she isn't worthy of basic hospitality? Why are you counting pennies rather than trying to be a quarter-way decent partner?", "Penny wise and pound foolish.  YTA and you're about to lose your bang maid.", "That utility difference ain't shit and neither are you", "How are you a partner?? YTA, you should CARE FOR HER if she's sick WTH", "Higher by how much?", "Boo effing hoo. Why is everything transactional? Why are you keeping score?"]}
