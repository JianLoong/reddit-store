If this has all been confirmed, then... Your father is a bigoted asshole and he has decided that his bigotry is more important to him than supporting his daughter on her big day. Disinviting him was the way to go, no one who doesn't support you should be there on your big day.\n\nBlock the other bigoted assholes defending his behavior. And set a firm boundary with the enablers, if they think defending his atrocious behavior and bigotry is more important than their relationship with you, it's time to reconsider what sort of relationship you want with those people in the future. But that can be figured out later, right now focus on you and your big day and make sure that everyone there is only there to celebrate and support you both.", "NTA and it just blows my mind that there are so many parents in this world who can't be supportive of their children.  I don't give 2 shits what \"time period\" he's from, you are his child.  He should love you and be there for you PERIOD.  This is your wedding day, and you deserve to be happy.  If him not being there will make you happy, then that is what should happen.", "NTA- it sounds like you\u2019re still being very generous by willing to give him a chance if he chooses to reach out and apologize. You are standing up for yourself, as you should. \n\nWith that said - you\u2019ll only have this day once. If you think that it will affect YOU to not have him there, or that you wish strongly that you\u2019d have that family harmony on your wedding day, it might be worthwhile to communicate everything you need to say directly to your dad (maybe in writing by email if that\u2019s easier). I\u2019m only suggesting this if it is something you might want for your own peace of mind - to know that at least you tried everything you could. \n\nYour dad is in the wrong for not loving you unconditionally and you have every right to not include him in your wedding day", "NTA. What do you mean he needs time to get used to it when you\u2019ve been together for years?! I thought religion was supposed to be about tolerance and acceptance and and not being judgemental?

As she put it, they're supposed to be celibate, so who cares who they are attracted to?

It was applied to those who are now in their 80's and 90's, then it started being applied to those in their 60's and 70's and now I've seen it applied to 50 year olds! Such rubbish for a generation being teenagers in the 80's!", "NTA but, given that your father didn't say this to you and it came through your mom, I think you should give him a chance and at least talk to him about it. It's clear he regrets being an asshole so I say let him tell you that.", "NTA and frankly, that \u201cfrom another time\u201d excuse is getting old. Know who else was from another time? My Catholic grandparents. They wound up with two LGBTQ+ grand-kids and were as loving and supportive with them as all the rest. Know who else was? My other grandmother.

When you heard from your mom, the right thing would have been to go talk with your Dad instead of disinviting him based just on what your mom said.   Instead, you made an emotional decision without talking to the main person involved.  \n\nYou're asking him to apologize for something that he probably said in confidence to your mother.  He didn't say it to you.  He didn't say it to the rest of the family.  He said it to his wife and she, imprudently, shared that with you.   There's nothing there for him to apologize for.  \n\nHe's not threatening to 'disown' you, even though he clearly has issues with gay marriage.   You're the one threatening that.  \n\nWhat should you do?  Go to him, apologize for being hasty, and ask if he would like to go.  If he says no, then at least he's the one making the decision.", "YTA\n\n\"Am I being unreasonable here\"\n\nI think so. All of the information you are receiving is secondhand. Have a conversation with him directly. I don't think you should have sent him an invitation in the first place without having some kind of a good idea what the risks were, by actually talking to him.\n\nAs for whether or not to disinvite him and demand an apology for merely being undecided, I personally disagree very strongly for the reasons your family members have said, however my bigger issue is what I have stated above. Your conversation and decision about whether to associate with your father should have occurred long before the wedding invitations were sent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he thinks it\u2019s a lesbian wedding then clearly the trans part doesn\u2019t really make a difference so he shouldn\u2019t care that your fianc\u00e9e is trans.

Might be with mentioning that to your mom. Tell her that, if your dad reaches out to you and expresses his support, you'll hear him out.

But how many times have you seen parents of queer people say, \u201cI was raised to not support this but i love you and i\u2019ll go to your wedding\u201d?  That\u2019s why I suggest OP go to her father and ask directly and nip it in the bud. Make an informed decision. Maybe he\u2019s an absolute bigot, maybe he\u2019s not.
