The name Olivia has a bit of a history with our family. To make a long story short, I was bullied by a girl named Olivia for years. My parents had to move me out of our local small school into a bigger one and it did not stop there. What started as an 8 year old being mean and cruel at times turned into a 16 year old being arrested for harassing and making my life absolutely hell and going so far that she was considered a stalker. It was so bad that from the ages of 12 to 16 I did not leave home without one of my parents or one of my older brothers, who were several years older than me. It was also so bad that my parents had to call the police on a few occasions where Olivia followed me home and was outside our house trying to get to me. To say this was a huge ordeal for all of us is an understatement and to say it left me with some mental scarring would be an even larger understatement. \n\nSo when my sister announced that her daughter's name was Olivia, it was a shock. My mom asked her if she was serious and my sister grew defensive and said of course she was serious. That Olivia is the most popular name right now and for good reason, because it's beautiful. My brothers told her she was insensitive and that they had no idea she cared so little about me. Which added to the defensiveness. Dad didn't say a lot. But he told her it would take some time for us all to adjust to the name. \n\nShe did not like that. I actually didn't say anything but she started ranting and raving about how many people are named Olivia and we're not acting like that about them. I wasn't there for the whole thing but my mom and oldest brother apparently told her that she had every right to name her child whatever they wanted, but that they felt she was very unfair to me, and that she had to understand what I had been through was something they would never fully grasp. Mom said she is an adult and old enough to accept that people have feelings and sometimes those feelings will matter more than others feelings.\n\nMy sister contacted me directly after a few weeks of our family not coming around. She said it was all my fault and that I should have been the one to say something positive about the name, that I could have turned the tide with the family. I told her that was a name tied up with a lot of trauma for me. She called it bullshit and said I am old enough now (20) to be mature about it and to not take it out on her and her daughter. To not hate a name because of a single person. I told her that she's old enough to understand she can't force our family to pretend we like her daughter's name. I told her SHE is old enough to give us the time that was asked for and that none of us said it was ugly or awful. But it's associated with my worst memories. She told me we were trying to influence what she could and couldn't name her daughter and it made us assholes, especially me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692611050, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x2vly/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_doesnt_get_to/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My sister clearly loves the name she gave her daughter. She clearly felt strongly enough about the name to argue with the family over it.

There's quite a lot of names I love in and of themselves, but just sometimes you knew a person with that name who acted horribly towards you and therefore that horrible behaviour is somehow linked to that name in your mind. So you don't want to give your child a name that will always be associated in your mind with something that is bad or just unpleasant to you.\n\nIn that light, I find it very strange your sister would choose this name. She must have her own biases and hang-ups about certain names herself, which means she should certainly be able to comprehend you will forever associate the name \"Olivia\" with your past trauma. I mean, it's not a wild leap.\n\nI have to say I think your family handled this very graciously actually; they politely pointed out what the issue was and didn't even demand any changes from her, just were very straight-up about \"yes, you are free to do this, but that does not mean you're free from consequences\".

There are loads of pretty names, why choose the one name that is holding so much trauma for your family? \n\nHow did your sister think that choice would be recieved by you all? Why would she let her girl go into the world with that disadvantage towards her own family? Normally I say that the name is up to the parents alone, and everyone else can shut it. But it just seems so unneccessary to chose that one name that is tied to such horrible memories. \n\nIt is perfectly understandable that you at least need time to adjust.

To you, and her own kid.", "That is perfect, the next child can be called Martin and then they will be olive and martini", "That\u2019s cute!", "Liv is nice!", "Most people are not bullied so bad it becomes stalking and the police need to get involved multiple times. That is how bad it got. It took her getting arrested for everything to stop and I have needed therapy since.", "Not liking a name because of horrible experiences is dictating another person's life? You're pretending like OP is demanding the name be changed, struck from the records and Olivia excommunicated.", "You're right, because clearly Olivia is the only name out of literally thousands that her sister could have chosen.\nAnd many people have been bullied for 8 years, to the point the police were involved./s\nWhat you lack in empathy you make up for in cluelessness."]}
