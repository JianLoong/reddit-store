The name Olivia has a bit of a history with our family. To make a long story short, I was bullied by a girl named Olivia for years. My parents had to move me out of our local small school into a bigger one and it did not stop there. What started as an 8 year old being mean and cruel at times turned into a 16 year old being arrested for harassing and making my life absolutely hell and going so far that she was considered a stalker. It was so bad that from the ages of 12 to 16 I did not leave home without one of my parents or one of my older brothers, who were several years older than me. It was also so bad that my parents had to call the police on a few occasions where Olivia followed me home and was outside our house trying to get to me. To say this was a huge ordeal for all of us is an understatement and to say it left me with some mental scarring would be an even larger understatement. \n\nSo when my sister announced that her daughter's name was Olivia, it was a shock. My mom asked her if she was serious and my sister grew defensive and said of course she was serious. That Olivia is the most popular name right now and for good reason, because it's beautiful. My brothers told her she was insensitive and that they had no idea she cared so little about me. Which added to the defensiveness. Dad didn't say a lot. But he told her it would take some time for us all to adjust to the name. \n\nShe did not like that. I actually didn't say anything but she started ranting and raving about how many people are named Olivia and we're not acting like that about them. I wasn't there for the whole thing but my mom and oldest brother apparently told her that she had every right to name her child whatever they wanted, but that they felt she was very unfair to me, and that she had to understand what I had been through was something they would never fully grasp. Mom said she is an adult and old enough to accept that people have feelings and sometimes those feelings will matter more than others feelings.\n\nMy sister contacted me directly after a few weeks of our family not coming around. She said it was all my fault and that I should have been the one to say something positive about the name, that I could have turned the tide with the family. I told her that was a name tied up with a lot of trauma for me. She called it bullshit and said I am old enough now (20) to be mature about it and to not take it out on her and her daughter. To not hate a name because of a single person. I told her that she's old enough to understand she can't force our family to pretend we like her daughter's name. I told her SHE is old enough to give us the time that was asked for and that none of us said it was ugly or awful. But it's associated with my worst memories. She told me we were trying to influence what she could and couldn't name her daughter and it made us assholes, especially me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692611050, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x2vly/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_doesnt_get_to/", "score": 882, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
