I did not just rock up out of nowhere. Same people who were on that packed train just moments before raced out of the train I was on and LEGGED IT to front carriages to bagsy a seat. And when they didn't find any they let their kids sit on the floor.\n\n-The response \"children sitting on the floor\" didn't make sense to me in the moment. Train about to depart so all was happening quickly. That's why I said \"I don't care about your children sitting on the floor\" \n\n- the old woman was just an entitled and patronising old person in a way only old English people can be. There was space next to her. She chose to puff up and be an obstacle.\n\n- there was space on that train. People just chose to not move.\n\n- the next train would have been in 30 min if it was on time. There was no guarantee I would be able to get on it as all trains were dropping last carriages. 30 min could have been 1h.\n\n- there. Was. Enough. Space. On. The. Train.\n\n- journey was total of 15 min. Suck it up people. Yes it's hot. But you dont live in a silo.

Because you were right they shouldn't be", "NTA I'm so sick of entitled ass parents acting like their children are delicate glass angels bestowed upon us unworthy masses, and I'm even sicker of other people enabling this sort of behavior. The kids need to stand tf up, move the tf aside, and let other ticketed passengers on board. Fuck the parents that weren't stepping in to help. I don't care about their stupid children either, how about that.", "Nta, those children should have been standing to make more space for everyone else.", "NTA\n\nSomeone needed to be making those kids stand up. The floor isn't a seating area on any train I've been on (granted, I didn't take a train while in England). Even if it's allowed there, they had no business making people miss the train.

Children - especially as young as 8 - can dehydrate incredibly quickly. A packed train at 28C? Adults should have offered their seats to the kids and any other vulnerable people. I\u2019ve experienced train fiascos like this and safety goes out the window in terms of who\u2019s sitting or standing where. So it\u2019s pretty rich to uniquely blame small children for sitting on the ground, when adults often have to do the same. Only an adult is far less likely to get as severely injured on the ground than a child, if someone trips and falls on them. Trains are public transportation open to people of all ages. Those kids got there before you did and it sounds like the other adults on the train were being as fair and conscientious as possible in the circumstances. Sadly the British rail system is an absolute shambles at the moment and having your journey upended is a real risk. That\u2019s just the way it is and it sucks. You\u2019re not an AH for wanting to get where you need to go. But you definitely were an AH for thinking your convenience is more important than other passengers who were already situated.", "NTA.  Those kids should never have sat down.  Hope trains there are cleaner than the ones in the US because sitting on the floor sounds disgusting.", "As a parent of an 8yo and 10yo, you're NTA. My kids would never be allowed to sit on the floor in the aisle. If the were too tired to stand we'd be waiting for the next train due to both safety issues but also because it's just not on to block other paying passengers from boarding because my kids want to sit down on the floor.\n\nIn my mind, any seated passenger disagreeing with you should have either offered their seat to one of the children, or to the parent so the child could sit on the parent's lap making more space.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, but maybe what people were getting at was \u2018there isn\u2019t space there, there are kids sat down. So even if they stand up, they\u2019ll still be taking up that space\u2019 - if it was like two kids sat sprawled out then fair enough I\u2019d be raging too, but if there were 10 of them all sat crammed in on the floor maybe people who could see them were like \u2018even if they all stood up there\u2019s still no space for anyone else\u2019 - which might explain why people were having a go at you", "NTA. You were completely in the right and this is my biggest pet peeve on the tube - ie when people refuse to move into the aisles of the trains and all crowd by the door, forcing immense discomfort/causing people to miss trains when there\u2019s actually plenty of space!\n\nFor the record, 15 min of standing in discomfort is way less of an inconvenience than standing around for another 30 min in 30 degree weather. Sometimes public transport requires a mild level of discomfort via being in close quarters with other people. If this bothers people so much they can drive. Also FYI it is incredibly unsafe to have children sitting on the floor in crowded spaces. You are creating a tripping hazard by encouraging this, and god forbid people fall over/there\u2019s some kind of emergency that compels people to run", "NAH.\n\nAsking other passengers to stand to facilitate you being able to get on the train is perfectly acceptable.

Good on you for saying something and not just tolerating it like everyone else.", "I worked in daycare, every year we make a puplic transportation tour with the kids and every year the guid says: kids in elementary should sit at all time, they are weaker then adults even disabled adults which means in case of an accident they will fly trough the tram and probaply die\" ... no you are not the asshole for not knowing that .. but you will be if you ever again want to make a kid stand up. The older lady was keeping the kids safe because no adults could be bothered to stand.", "They got an answer, kept making the same demand, and then pushed their way onto the train. That's not polite. Then they size/age checked other people.\n\nAlso, they claim it's the London underground and they're taking it to the seaside - London underground trains don't go to the seaside so it's an overground train which go faster than underground trains.

It\u2019s too many folks.\u201d Then someone comes barging in with no personal space.\n\nPlease just wait so we don\u2019t travel like crayons.", "And the leftover residue from a bunch of lager cans.", "And that's putting it mildly!", "People let their children do the most disgusting things without second thought. My personal pet peeve is the way parents are regarding toilets. I don't care if their princes and princesses are messy at home (you do you) but in public? I've been to several petting farms and amusement parks, and so many of them have the most disgusting toilets, including toilet paper everywhere and water on the floor, and somehow kids always seem to spill when they're actually peeing so that mixes with the water... well, you get it. And still, when it's summer, there are kids who go to the toilet, on bare feet, regardless of what the floor looks like. Or worse: with their socks on. And stupidest of all is when the parents go in without shoes on as well. I just don't understand why they're not bothered.", "Now that I have reached senior citizen status, I am no longer shy about asking for a seat on public transit because no one gives a seat to a lady with a cane.  We were taught to automatically surrender a seat to a person who needed one.  Ah, the good old days when young people had actual good manners.  I'm convinced these youngsters are being raised by wolves.  \ud83e\udd9c", "sounds like this was a train, not a tube: UK trains don't have poles. The seats are airline style with two seats each side of the aisle and a corridor down the middle.", "FYI - if it's a London train to the coast, there is likely only to be a pole in the space by the doors. The aisle won't have poles or straps because there will be forward and backward facing seats in twos or threes either side.", "I\u2019m fine generally just not with standing for long periods of time. If I decide to sit on the floor it\u2019s cause the train journey is 30 mins-2 hours long. \n\nI should\u2019ve clarified I can walk just fine but I fall over easily when a train/bus is moving lol but I\u2019m not gonna argue with someone over a seat when I\u2019m not disabled/pregnant/elderly.", "OP has noted they didn\u2019t shout. Having been on trains in the UK in this very type of scenario, people don\u2019t move down automatically and are relatively inconsiderate. Typically, it is a case of the message to move down/get up is only passed down the carriage after someone stuck by the door bellows for people to move down.", "I am not really sure but even if they sold only 500 it could be more than a 100 wanting to go on a specific time, they have no way to know in advance other than making predictions. Tbf I have never been on a train which was so busy people couldn\u2019t get in so never questioned it too much, but maybe in places like London it could be different", "If they dont want to travel in a crowded train they can get off and wait for the next one.

I can't imagine letting my kid sit on the floor of public transportation. So nasty and a good way to get sick.", "When I was little in my country there was an unofficial order on public transport 1. Pregnant women and injured people/physically disabled in terms of having difficulty or pain not sitting 2. Elderly and people disabled in other ways physically or mentally 3. Children and their parents/carers. So as I kid I was expected to stand and give up seats for those people but able bodied young adults would often offer and give up seats or more comfy spaces for me and my mum. But even though people often gave up seats for kids, everyone's comfort and necessity were priority, no one would've expected someone to miss their journey so a child could sit, especially on the floor! If I refused to stand up so more people could fit or sit my parents would've been so mad. Assuming this story is real (I'm apprehensive of many AITA stories) I don't understand why parents didn't make the kids stand up. Many kids would've stood up without being told too, 8-12 is old enough to understand such situations and take action to be kind.", "I live in Canada and think this is still the case here. \n\nA man stood up for me on a train recently (I\u2019m not old, just a woman and was carrying a bunch of stuff) and he scolded a ten-ish year old boy for trying to sit down. \n\nFeel like it goes pregnant women/people with canes or walkers or crutches > old people > women > men > children.", "If your kid is too small to stand on the train they should be on your lap, in a pram, or in your arms.", "In that case, I can easily see why people may have to sit on the floor if there are no seats available. People falling can be dangerous even if there are no children involved", "It's not clear if we weren't there that there was \"clearly room.\"", "But there are also plenty of maybes that apply to the people you were shouting at. You don\u2019t know why those kids were sitting on the floor. It\u2019s insanely hot in southern England this week - maybe those kids were feeling unwell, maybe they have additional needs, maybe all sorts of things. You don\u2019t know their circumstances any more than they know yours. \n\nTo give an example, I have disabled twins and we just can\u2019t access pubic transport any more. Just the thought of having to deal with that situation with them in tow breaks me out in a cold sweat. I just don\u2019t know what we would do. I couldn\u2019t race 10 carriages full of people to get seats while dragging them along, and the only possible way I could keep them safe without seats would be to sit them on the floor and stand over them. One of them is visually impaired and can\u2019t put either foot flat on the floor. There\u2019s just no way he could stand up in a moving vehicle. So we just don\u2019t get to access those things full stop. Some people are braver than me and will just do it and deal with the complications (and people calling them entitled etc) that arise. I can\u2019t do it. \n\nTrains like that are really not made for lots of people standing in them - there\u2019s nothing for anyone to hold on to, especially kids.  \n\nThe problem here is not the kids sitting on the floor or the people saying they couldn\u2019t move further back because there were people in the way. The problem is insufficient train services and train companies selling 10 carriages worth of tickets and having to move everyone to four carriages. This thread is pitting \u201centitled parents\u201d against \u201cpeople who feel entitled to push on\u201d which really misses the point.", "You sound totally annoying. Have some empathy and chill out. Life will be easier and more pleasant.", "Yes that\u2019s fair enough. Unfortunately I would say better get used to it because climate change aghhh. Silly of me to be smug abt heat tolerance rly as I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fifty degrees here come midsummer", "This wasn\u2019t an emergency.  I hate when people act like vacation is some grand thing. You weren\u2019t late for the operating room.", "This is SPARTA!!!", "Op had described children sitting in the aisles. \n\nThis means there was room, it just wasn\u2019t being used effectively or with regard to others.", "I get your point. I was just explaining the person above who mentioned everything is dirty despite cleaning.", "Thank you. This comment is spot on from beginning to end. Came here to say something similar but you said it better, both in terms of the lack of acknowledgement and empathy that the parents and kids might have more going on, and the misdirected anger that doesn\u2019t acknowledge the gutting of public transit in many places", "Insane to me that you\u2019re saying this as someone who rode the NYC subway for a decade. I did the same and I guarantee in such a situation people would\u2019ve plucked those kids off the ground themselves. Sometimes one reasonable, confrontational person is needed to engage with a ridiculous situation and remind people not to behave like animals. A train is not designed for constant comfort, it\u2019s designed to get people from A to B in one piece.", "Sizzling", "FIRE! FIRE!", "They said they couldn\u2019t move and you pushed in regardless.", "Is that not what you did, though? You prioritized yourself over others on the train when you squeezed on. You certainly didn't consider the kids (they could just be children of entitled parents, or they could have been disabled in some way, or could have been sick, or on the verge of fainting, who knows). What about the people behind you, that couldn't make it on the train? You prioritized yourself over them too. \n\nRegardless, it's a frustrating situation. It's hard to determine who, exactly, is \"at fault,\" but I think YTA for how you handled it.", "I think the issue is that everyone on that train was trying to leave a little extra space between them because you can\u2019t pack in as tightly when there is an end point where people are standing without anyone standing next to them. That\u2019s a recipe for disaster.  So yes, you perceived that the normal amount of people could continue to pack in to the train, but the train occupants were being smart and safe not to get packed in like sardines and risk the closest people falling onto the children.", "Yeah but you inconvenienced 30 other people versus just being inconvenienced yourself. That's what makes you TA.\nIf 30 people are saying \"no room\" then theres no room. 30>1", "> I acknowledge that some will see me as an asshole. I can be an asshole.\n\nOkay....so...why even post here?", "OP WAS entitled to be on the train. They bought  a ticket.", "There was space.\nThey could move.\nThey just chose not to", "It's been whole day of reading comments.\n\nDidn't think I was an asshole.\n\nWanted to hear what people think.\n\nIsn't that the point of posting here?", "Except the literal reason she and the other 30 passengers couldn't get on is that the train was packed. You're not entitled to crush other passengers to cram yourself onto a service that's full, that's just bad manners. It's still ESH. Kids could probably have stood, but OP could have waited and not been an AH about it.", "I'd rather kids take up room than get squished in an overfull train \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You're *not* entitled to board a train that's full. It's common sense that you wait for the next one rather than ramming yourself in past people in the doorway when the train is full. That's how crushes start.", "I get that if the train was actually full, but it wasn\u2019t. There were children sitting on the floor, which I feel like is a bigger safety hazard than OP hopping on the train.", "Um. No. I have kids. They can stand for the 15 min train ride so people can get on. What the hell?", "Did the old lady think it's normal for kids to sit on the floor and presumably take up far more space than they would if they were standing? Where did she get that idea? Just popped into her head at that moment?", "Easier to read IMO... \n\nI hate reading books written in 1st person.", "It isn't. \n\nIf it was a set swap then that would have been a planning and control decision made in the ivory towers. (They are usually idiotic decisions and leave people like me on the front line cleaning up their messes.)\n\nSuitable road replacement transport or a like for like replacement should have been arranged long  before the 10-car had arrived.\n\nHowever, this sounds like a connection from a long distance intercity service (which are 1:1 tickets to seats) to a local commuter service (rated to carry both seated and standing passengers with unreserved seating).\n\n>Evidently with zero assistance from employees like you.\n\nWe are horrendously understaffed and there is currently a drive to cut platform and ticket office staff in a bid to boost profit margins.\nWe are as guards, 1 guard on a 2 - 12 car train.

The service would grind to a halt.\n\nWe do what we can but there simply aren't enough staff at stations to manage situations like this.\nIt's one of the main reasons as to why we've regularly been voting to go on strike for the past year to save the jobs of station staff whose job it is to manage situations like this.", "Yes, I find it difficult to step away when I see asshole behaviour. \n\nThanks for your comment.", "Don't kick the goddamn baby.", "Nope, not how the train works.
