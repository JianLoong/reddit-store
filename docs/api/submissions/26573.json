Someone who is sitting can take them on their lap.\n\nSounds unreasonable.", "INFO were the kids sitting on the floor in the aisle? Because you were right they shouldn't be", "NTA I'm so sick of entitled ass parents acting like their children are delicate glass angels bestowed upon us unworthy masses, and I'm even sicker of other people enabling this sort of behavior. The kids need to stand tf up, move the tf aside, and let other ticketed passengers on board. Fuck the parents that weren't stepping in to help. I don't care about their stupid children either, how about that.", "Nta, those children should have been standing to make more space for everyone else.", "NTA\n\nSomeone needed to be making those kids stand up. The floor isn't a seating area on any train I've been on (granted, I didn't take a train while in England). Even if it's allowed there, they had no business making people miss the train. It wasn't going to harm any of them to stand up and let people pass. \n\nIsn't it also a fire/safety issue having a bunch of kids blocking the floor??", "YTA. Children - especially as young as 8 - can dehydrate incredibly quickly. A packed train at 28C? Adults should have offered their seats to the kids and any other vulnerable people. I\u2019ve experienced train fiascos like this and safety goes out the window in terms of who\u2019s sitting or standing where. So it\u2019s pretty rich to uniquely blame small children for sitting on the ground, when adults often have to do the same. Only an adult is far less likely to get as severely injured on the ground than a child, if someone trips and falls on them. Trains are public transportation open to people of all ages. Those kids got there before you did and it sounds like the other adults on the train were being as fair and conscientious as possible in the circumstances. Sadly the British rail system is an absolute shambles at the moment and having your journey upended is a real risk. That\u2019s just the way it is and it sucks. You\u2019re not an AH for wanting to get where you need to go. But you definitely were an AH for thinking your convenience is more important than other passengers who were already situated.", "NTA.  Those kids should never have sat down.  Hope trains there are cleaner than the ones in the US because sitting on the floor sounds disgusting.", "As a parent of an 8yo and 10yo, you're NTA. My kids would never be allowed to sit on the floor in the aisle. If the were too tired to stand we'd be waiting for the next train due to both safety issues but also because it's just not on to block other paying passengers from boarding because my kids want to sit down on the floor.\n\nIn my mind, any seated passenger disagreeing with you should have either offered their seat to one of the children, or to the parent so the child could sit on the parent's lap making more space.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, but maybe what people were getting at was \u2018there isn\u2019t space there, there are kids sat down. So even if they stand up, they\u2019ll still be taking up that space\u2019 - if it was like two kids sat sprawled out then fair enough I\u2019d be raging too, but if there were 10 of them all sat crammed in on the floor maybe people who could see them were like \u2018even if they all stood up there\u2019s still no space for anyone else\u2019 - which might explain why people were having a go at you", "NTA. You were completely in the right and this is my biggest pet peeve on the tube - ie when people refuse to move into the aisles of the trains and all crowd by the door, forcing immense discomfort/causing people to miss trains when there\u2019s actually plenty of space!\n\nFor the record, 15 min of standing in discomfort is way less of an inconvenience than standing around for another 30 min in 30 degree weather. Sometimes public transport requires a mild level of discomfort via being in close quarters with other people. If this bothers people so much they can drive. Also FYI it is incredibly unsafe to have children sitting on the floor in crowded spaces. You are creating a tripping hazard by encouraging this, and god forbid people fall over/there\u2019s some kind of emergency that compels people to run", "NAH.\n\nAsking other passengers to stand to facilitate you being able to get on the train is perfectly acceptable.

Good on you for saying something and not just tolerating it like everyone else.", "I worked in daycare, every year we make a puplic transportation tour with the kids and every year the guid says: kids in elementary should sit at all time, they are weaker then adults even disabled adults which means in case of an accident they will fly trough the tram and probaply die\" ... no you are not the asshole for not knowing that .. but you will be if you ever again want to make a kid stand up. The older lady was keeping the kids safe because no adults could be bothered to stand.", "They got an answer, kept making the same demand, and then pushed their way onto the train. That's not polite. Then they size/age checked other people.\n\nAlso, they claim it's the London underground and they're taking it to the seaside - London underground trains don't go to the seaside so it's an overground train which go faster than underground trains. People sit down on these trains all the time. So this post doesn't full add up anyway.", "Not a popular opinion but I will go with ESH. Those kids shouldn\u2019t be sitting on the floor and you were wrong to push everyone and get on a super crowded train.", "YTA.

You\u2019re having a fucking laugh. It was an an absolute oven with the humidity yesterday and it must\u2019ve felt at least 35C in that heat\n\nMy kid would\u2019ve fainted.

What exactly did you think would happen if they stood? They would still take up space - that block of incorrectly assumed empty space would not have magically been available for people to stand in.\n\nYou were anxious and stressed, but that's no excuse for being verbally aggressive towards people and throwing a tantrum when people are just looking after their needs in an environment where everyone is stressed.", "Nta", "NTA\n\n10 carriages into 4 is just brutal.
