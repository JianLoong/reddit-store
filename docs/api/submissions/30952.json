He got annoyed and told me I wasn\u2019t muffling my coughs, and that I was waking him up in the middle of the night and torturing him. I got frustrated and called him an asshole for accusing me of torturing him and depriving him of his sleep. \n\nI took my pillow to sleep on the couch so my coughing wouldn\u2019t wake him up.

How are you supposed to suppress and muffle your cough? You\u2019re not doing this for shit and giggles. You\u2019re sick. Plus, it\u2019s not like you are enjoying the coughing.

Sure hes the TA and should have offered to sleep on the couch if the coughing bothered him so much. \n\nThat being said, far more importantly, do you feel like you regularly have to ask your husband not to get angry at things he absolutely should not be getting angry at you for? I say this from a place of so much compassion, there was a time I would have used that exact same verbiage. And at that time I would have told you my ex wasn't abusive, just stressed or learning to deal with his emotions, or not empathetic/good at dealing with thingd or whatever other reasoning I could make make sense in my head to justify the fact I had to ask him not to be angry at me for being sick. I am using that example because it was my story too. I was puking my guts up and we only had 1 downstairs bathroom and he was angry he had to go upstairs.\n\nPlease know you should not have to live like that.

You\u2019re allowed to be unhappy that he not only accused you of not being considerate when you actually were, but that he also didn\u2019t think of your comfort and worry about you. He is supposed to be your partner, and he is supposed to be taking care of you. \n\nEven if you suggested sleeping on the couch, he is supposed to immediately remember that he loves you and instead let you sleep on the bed while he takes the couch. This is not a test or anything. It\u2019s basic human decency, and your life partner failed on multiple accounts.", "It's funny, I just had a similar situation a few weeks ago.  My wife coughed nonstop, and it drove me mad.  Not angry but insane.  Sleep deprivation is not conducive for mental health. \n\nIts feels very insensitive having this irritation with a) a person you love and b) the person has no control over their body, but you are allowed to feel irritated but the way you go about it is what matters.  I gave my wife a kiss on her forehead and took the blanket and cushion to the couch.  Your husband could have done the same, so he expects his sick wife to sleep on the couch.  That is a bit rough.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019ve just had Covid again and have the dry persistent cough that\u2019s worst at night. My poor partner, I apologise to him all night.

Your husband is a bit of a dick, my friend.", "NTA, but he is a real massive one and tbh I'd reconsider some things if I were you.\n\nWhen you're in a better state of mind and health you need to sit him down and let him have it. How you're disappointed in him, how he is selfish and unkind, how you were sick and you needed him to be compassionate and helpful, but all you got was attacked. This behaviour is unacceptable in every shape and form. You need him to make some changes or else.\n\nI would not let this slide for a moment.", "I would hope he doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for coughing, you can only do so much.

The point of coughing is to break up the mucus to get it out of your body and help you heal\n\nYou husband is an AH though.  also you shouldn't go to work a 12 hour shift if you are this sick, pneumonia and stuff.

That's not okay.", "NTA but your husband definitely is.", "NTA.\n\nPretty sure everyone has experienced that coughs like that and know they are worse at night.\n\nIf you sleep slightly upright (an extra pillow or 2 to prop you up) that might help.

He sounds like a dick. When I cough in the night my partner asks if I\u2019m ok and if I need water. \n\nI offer this for your comfort not his, try the lozenges with anaesthetic in them, they\u2019re great for that itchy throat kind of cough.", "Well you made the choice to go to the couch, he didn't \"let you\", you made the choice to go out there when you could've stayed in bed. He didn't make you. Also it doesn't sound like you did anything at all to actually stop the coughing, correct me if I'm wrong but you could've had a glad of water, a throatie, inhaler, eucalyptus oil, etc to help with the cough.

You shouldn't be made to feel bad for coughing when sick... now, if my husband would've said something like that to me when I was sick (which when I had the flu, I was coughing up my lungs every 10 dang minutes), I would be petty and cough even louder with moans and grunts, followed by more coughing. And if it annoys him, tell his butt to sleep on the couch if he don't like it. \n\nNow, the next time he gets sick, just tell him he's disturbing your sleep and to be quiet.
