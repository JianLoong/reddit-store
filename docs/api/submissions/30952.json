When my husband and I started falling asleep last night, I couldn\u2019t help but feel the urge to cough because my throat was so itchy and I couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer. I tried to muffle the coughing with the comforter but my husband got woken up by my coughs and became angry at me for waking him up. \n\nToday I asked him to not get angry at me tonight. I try really hard to hold my coughs in when we go to bed, but I end up in worse coughing fits when I do that. He got annoyed and told me I wasn\u2019t muffling my coughs, and that I was waking him up in the middle of the night and torturing him. I got frustrated and called him an asshole for accusing me of torturing him and depriving him of his sleep. \n\nI took my pillow to sleep on the couch so my coughing wouldn\u2019t wake him up. Now I\u2019m mad that he actually let me sleep on the couch before my 12 hour shift the next day and he\u2019s just snoozing comfortably in bed. AITA for coughing at night and waking him up in addition to calling him the asshole here? I probably shouldn\u2019t have called him an asshole but I just wished he would understand I wasn\u2019t coughing to spite him or wake him up on purpose.\n\nEdit:\nI am not Covid positive.

OP is sick and is absolutely NTA. Unfortunately if she's in the US she may not have much choice to stay home.", "Get a humidifier for your room at night, I use mine every night regardless of if I\u2019m sick or not. It helps sooo much!", "\"I took my pillow to sleep on the couch so my coughing wouldn\u2019t wake him up. **Now I\u2019m mad** that he actually let me sleep on the couch **before my** **12 hour shift** the next day and **he\u2019s just snoozing** comfortably in bed.\"\n\nyou are mad because you think you deserve it more to sleep in the bed because of your upcoming 12h shift - the emphasis on the upcoming 12h shift makes it look that you think your sleep is more important than his", "It doesn\u2019t matter because you do deserve a comfortable sleep. If he had a problem he should have taken the couch like a gentleman who actually loves their spouse would. Honestly does he get mad at you over things you can\u2019t control? Do you care for him when he\u2019s sick? Do you tell him when he\u2019s sick to suck it up?", "She said she got sick over the weekend, nothing chronic here.", "oh i absolutely sympathize with her.  just pointing out some generals.  And it absolutely sucks the way we have to contend with work while we are sick. And the overall judgment we get from coworkers.  Even my own statement is making an assumption by what she said. So if i, not even seeing/knowing her, can conclude this, then so shall her peers.", " Just a suggestion which has worked gor me, you can keep a  [clove](https://images.app.goo.gl/hVtYwETNHY8Rtvhd6) in your moith and chew it slightly to relieve the coughing. You can do this if you don't have anything else to soothe your throat at that time.", "Im so sorry you have such sucky employees. And i should have said \"taught US\" not you.  Whats worse is the fact that you work healthcare and cant fully take care of yourself. Its so crappy that our employers dont care about our well being.\n\ni hope you do get better.  I am actually dealing with a cough too. so i totally get it.  Mine doesnt sound as bad as yours right now though. Everywhere i go right now, i get so many looks for just having a slight cough.\n\nI do stand by my comment that your hubs is an AH for what he did to you.", "EW", "Great. Be around patients when you're sick. Just what they need.", "Hospital management is also an AH here. \n\nCovid is not the only thing that causes a cough that can be devastating. Influenza, RSV, parainfluenza. All can cause a ton of problems even in otherwise healthy people. Of course you know this. \n\nAnd they won\u2019t let you take sick leave unless it\u2019s just one of the potentially fatal infections that cause a cough?! This is why these diseases spread so much. People are forced to choose between staying home and the ability to pay bills and eat. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. If my partner was sick I\u2019d take the couch for a few days so he could get better quality rest - and cough and sputter as he needs, because he would try holding in because of me.", "She absolutely does deserve more sleep. She\u2019s an over worked rn who works 12 hour shifts and is sick. Also who gets mad at their spouse for coughing I\u2019ll tell you who an absolute ass. I can\u2019t fathom being mad at my late spouse if he was sick and coughing. You know what the vows you took are and to be pissed at something that she can\u2019t control is ass behavior. In sickness and in heath. But I guess to you that only works one way huh. She should be the only one supporting him when he\u2019s sick huh.", "Right? That puts them at risk especially if their immune systems are already weak!!!", "You're acting like they have a choice. Believe me, nurses are very aware of what their patients need, and know that working while unwell is awful, but unfortunately sometimes it's working or losing the job", "And getting someone who is already hospitalized more sick. Ok.", " I mean nosocomial infections are omnipresent in hospitals regardless, but she can wear an N95/PPE to reduce the risk of infection.\n\nPlus frequent hand washing/sanitizing etc.\n\nIf you're not given time off unless you test positive for Covid then what other choice is there? This is a management issue and there are severe staff shortages everywhere these days."]}
