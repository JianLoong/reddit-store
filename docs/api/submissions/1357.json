Big red flag: \"My partner is considering ending our relationship because I won\u2019t provide the names.\" What about the partner getting dumped.", "OH, man. You've been put in a tough spot. You acted on behalf of your partner, who's now manipulating you into revealing the one thing that will keep them from being reported. Does your partner even get that you SAVED THEIR ASS???? No appreciation whatsovever? Do they get what an impossible situation is FOR YOU? \n\nIf my partner said to me, \"If you don't tell me who it was, I'm leaving\" I would be sorely tempted to say, \"Let me save you the trouble. Bye.\"\n\nBTW, if your partner had any self-awareness, they'd probably be able to figure out who they'd offended on their own. \n\nNTA", "I see both sides of this scenario.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to pass judgment when we don\u2019t know what was said.", "NTA but I'm seeing some red flags from your partner!", "If you were disloyal, you wouldn't have said anything and let him be reported. NTA", "INFO: What was said?\n\nI have to know to determine who is an AH here.", "Soft NTA, because there\u2019s a good bit of ambiguity around the topic.", "NTA but honestly your BF's reaction and desire to be punitive makes me think you might want to reconsider that relationship. It also sounds like maybe he should have been reported so he would realize the seriousness of what he did.", "Someone who doesn't need additional stress or drama in their life doesn't go to a co-workers spouse to tell them they are going to report their husband at work. \n\nYTA, because your husband deserves to know who at work he needs to be careful around and is threatening to report him,  especially since they came to you about it.", "I mean he\u2019s considering leaving me because he feels like I didn\u2019t have his back. I should have defended him more. I should have known he would not have behaved that way. I shouldn\u2019t have told the people that it was him with the kid in the ER. I shouldn\u2019t keep any secrets from him if he directly asks\u2026", "Yeah, if I\u2019m being honest I\u2019m really upset with him. He said he\u2019s questioning whether he can be with me, we are sleeping in separate rooms and he\u2019s taking space, we aren\u2019t talking\u2026 I feel like if he cuts me loose, it might be for the best. If he wants to fix things I think I\u2019m owed some sort of apology\u2026", "Apparently he was spouting Covid conspiracies to a kid in the ER. He works with at risk youth at an inpatient facility. These friends were there because of their own grave health issues, which is another reason why I want to protect their identities. He doesn\u2019t need to know they were in the ER.", "He thinks I\u2019m the one with the red flags!!", "My partner works with at risk you at an inpatient facility. This conversation happened at the ER. My friends happened to be in the room next door. They said he was spouting \u201cfucked up covid conspiracies\u201d and that a person in his role should know better than to behave that way around a vulnerable population.", "Also, if your partner is threatening to break up over it he sounds kinda AHoley. I hate ultimatums in relationships.", "He says he wished the people had just reported him, so there was an investigation and I was kept out of it. I told him next time, I\u2019ll just stay in my lane and not try to protect him.", "They contacted me saying they overheard someone who works at his company acting in a way that needed to be reported, and asked me if I knew how they could do that. It was only after they explained the situation further that I realized the person on the other side of the ER door, curtain, whatever - was my partner. At that point they said they wouldn\u2019t report him if I had a conversation with him. But they wanted their identities to be anonymous. Bc again, they were in the ER for their own serious health issues. He didn\u2019t need to know, and if they had reported this to management, it would have been anonymous then as well.", "Is this the kind of guy you want as a partner? Reactions to this situation aside that behaviour is disgusting and misusing his authority.", "Ohh okay. This was a hard one to decide on when I didn\u2019t know the situation (honestly I thought it was going to roll into more of a harassment category).\n\nNo, you\u2019re not an AH. He really shouldn\u2019t be saying stupid stuff to just about anyone and everyone who will bother listening to him and expecting no one to say anything about it. \n\nIf he ends the relationship over it, he\u2019s doing you a favor. If he\u2019s going to end it because of something minor like this, he\u2019s not worth being in a relationship with.\n\nNTA.", "Yeah, I\u2019m feeling really uncomfortable about the ultimatum as well. Also, originally it was only this couple of friends, me, and him that knew about it. He started venting to all of his coworkers and friends, who now all think I\u2019m wrong\u2026 How am I supposed to stay friends with them in the future\u2026", "Kind of sounds like you realize his behavior might be problematic. My question about his character stands.", "I do question if he feels powerless without this information, and holding it over me like this makes him feel powerful again."]}
