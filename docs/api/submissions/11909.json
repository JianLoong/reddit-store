Last Christmas Eve I was at their house for dinner, and she kept saying things like \u201cI\u2019m so excited for Santa to come tonight\u201d and telling me everything she had asked him for and wondering what country he was in at that very moment. She doesn\u2019t have any younger siblings, so it\u2019s not like she was saying this for anybody else\u2019s benefit. She is a smart girl, does well in school, and has no developmental delays that I know of.

They said they absolutely did not want to tell her the truth and \u201cruin the magic\u201d of Christmas.

If it somehow got out that she still believed, and she got teased or bullied, that could be brutal and awful for her. Wasn\u2019t it better to hear it from her aunt than some mean girl (or guy)? \n\nSo, a week ago, I told her the truth. I tried to do it in a gentle way, explaining that what Santa represents (the spirit of Christmas) is very real, but that there wasn\u2019t actually a guy with flying reindeer going to every kid\u2019s house in one night to deliver presents. She didn\u2019t say much and got a bit teary eyed. But she did reach out to me a few days later and let me know that she appreciated me telling her the truth. \n\nHer parents, however, are furious at me and not talking to me.

Pretty sure having reality check like that at 13 is gonna be easier than trying to explain to a 18y/o that you've been lying to her about Santa Claus her whole life. Was it your decision to make? Nope. Parents however can get caught up in the magic of having kids who still believe in things like Santa Claus and the tooth fairy.

Personally, while I do feel that the parents shouldn\u2019t have let the truth go this far without being told, but it\u2019s kinda like religion in that it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s place to tell them what to believe.

Now I\u2019m on an information diet with everyone except for a very small circle of best friends.\n\nBy doing what they did, OP showed the niece that she can trust them when something\u2019s going on.  To be honest I don\u2019t think she should be sharing anything with her parents that they don\u2019t need to know \u2018cause the parents lied for 13 years.  I certainly know I\u2019ll value my future kids\u2019 trust over some mythical creature we call Santa.", "It's a little different than with religion. With religion, I'd assume both parents believed the same thing, along with a lot of their community. Here the parents clearly don't believe in Santa either.

I have a real problem with parents encouraging a literal belief in Santa. It's fine to just go along with the stories for little kids but the first time your kid seriously asks you if Santa is real in my opinion you should respect that, tell them no, but ask them not to ruin it for other kids who still believe.

You did not want her hurt and the fact she thanked you proves it. But you also gave her parents no time to come to terms with their last Santa Christmas. When you ended Santa, you did not just end him for your niece but also her parents. You took a part of their job away from them. You revealed the man behind the curtain and did not let them come out on their own. They do have a right to be mad with you overstepping. Give them time and accept that you ended their time as Santa without warning. That was rude and hopefully they will realize that they let it go on too long.

Last Christmas (Dec 2021) he was questioning a bit. Just after Christmas, we explained that Santa was more of an idea, and the magic was real. We explained that anyone can be Santa. We asked him how he felt when he got stockings (Santa only did stockings at our house) with surprises he forgot to ask for, or was his favorite things. He said that it made him feel good and that he loved the surprises. \n\nSo this most recent year (Dec 2022), we had him ask a couple of his friends secretly what they were looking forward to, their favorite things, etc. The week before Christmas we gave him an allowance for the 3 friends and let him buy a couple small things for each. Then we got him bags, and he hung the couple gifts from their doorknobs - signed secret Santa. I told him that the rule was you can't tell them who did it, and the joy comes from seeing them happy and enjoying their gifts. Now he asked to do this next year for the elderly neighbor that shared her vegetable seeds the other day for our spring greenhouse. \n\nI feel like OP is NTA, and the parents should have dropped small hints or idk something before he was this old and still believing. They were selfish to do so, as it is more about them and watching the magic - than thinking about the kiddo and what it could mean for them with school/friends/trust of their parents, etc.", "I did the same with two out of three of my kids. I broke it to them as they were entering middle school b/c I didn't want them to be the only one who (still) believed. My daughter was crushed and resents my telling her. My son was not traumatized. Lol. You do what you think is best at the time.\n\nHowever, it was not your place to tell your cousin, OP.", "My cousin was like 11 or 12 my uncle was legitimately concerned it meant something was wrong and he couldn\u2019t tell reality from fiction or something developmental was wrong", "I believed in Santa until super late (at least  age 12, I think), but I don't think either my classmates or my parents knew. One doesn't really go that much into details when talking about what one gets for Christmas. It doesn't even necessarily have to be much of a topic of conversation. It is very contextual.", "Oh good, I was reading this like...._y'all don't start sex ed till 13?_ But I know sex ed in the US can be a bit hit and miss...good to know that at least some places start earlier!", "Our district gave my 4th grader the basics on procreating.

This would also make an amazing Christmas ad- A kid is given strawberry seeds by old lady neighbour on a sunny day. Cut to December, kid sees old lady putting food out for the birds and waves to her, then goes to the garden shed to get birdseed to emulate her, and accidentally sees the new bike they asked for peeking out from behind a tarp. They have a silent 'Boooo, wait, that means...' moment, then make themselves a cotton wool beard, and sneak out on Christmas morning to hang a gift bag on the old lady's door. Inside is a little jar of home made strawberry jam with 'Love from Santa' written on it. Old lady smiles. \"\\[Some brand name for a garden centre\\]- Keep Love Growing\" :)", "Happy Cake Day", "I can sympathize with this situation. When I was like 6 my parents made a lazy mistake on a gift (badly crossed out \"Mom\" and wrote \"Santa\" next to it); I clearly remember seeing this and understanding what it meant. And I felt indifferent.\n\nI'm not sure what happened in the following years but my brain somehow decided to backtrack. Skip to me at 10, writing a letter to Santa. My mom and younger sister must've made an offhand remark... I don't recall what exactly happened, but I vividly remember how I felt: *crushed*. They didn't mean to hurt me; they thought I didn't truly believe anymore. So I tried to hide my utter disappointment and humiliation, went to my room, and cried my heart out. Deep down I'd always known, but I didn't *want* to. I'd convinced myself the magic was real.\n\nI still thank the powers that be that this didn't happen in front of my friends, or classmates. That would have been so brutal. Also, there is a certain age at which, when you discover the truth too late, you feel betrayed. Lied to. It's a tremendous mix of emotions and not something you want to experience in front of your peers. Who would *never* let you live it down. OOP saved her niece from this, and gave her time to process it quietly. \n\nHer parents are just pissed that niece is pissed at them. I can't blame the niece. I'm glad she has a trustworthy adult thinking about the long term.", "This. Maybe there's a coping reason for holding on so long. Not your kid not your choice. As someone who raised my nieces and nephews? I didn't pretend Santa was real because they had never had the experience. So we talked about it. Obviously to get into a situation like ours abuse was present. So I explained why we didn't make fun of people for believing and that I was Santa for them. That every parent who does this happens to do  this so their kids have fun and are inspired to help others. We take turns as Santa because we want others to be happy. Added history. So they knew he was a dead Greek guy in a whole other time period that inspired the entire world. I did my best to make sure they respected others that didn't know and had a reason to want to be good. \n\nGuess what? You didn't protect her by telling the truth but took something from her that she's held onto for a reason. As someone who knew he wasn't real and didn't understand I hurt a lot of my classmates because I didn't know I was being mean. When I did understand I felt awful. Why would you want to take someone's joy? If she's this far from normal averages? She's going to get bullied anyway. That's not right but it is reality. So those coping things are important. I'm an autistic adult who was 12 in high school since no one considered development differences as important over smarts. Consequences were bad. Very bad.", "4th grade at my old school. At that age it's not really sex ed, so much as learning about your own body and puberty. Actually I think my district did a pretty good job. I hope they were able to keep it modern and comprehensive.", "8 is a lot different to 13 in maturity though. If you go into high school at 14 believing in Santa it might not go well . That might be something you\u2019re willing to chance for you\u2019re own kid but some parents aren\u2019t .", "I was 12 almost 13 (summer birthday) when my parents told me Santa wasn't real. I was NEVER bullied. My friends never cared. I was sad when my parents said they were Santa. But I rallied! I told them it was OK. I KNEW the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy were REAL so I was fine. I thanked them and went to leave when they crushed my young naive soul. As I sat in the backyard sobbing and crying loud ugly tears my parents tried to help me make the leap connecting the Santa myth to his friends myth. I remember screaming,\" How could you....the Easter Bunny too? All that candy and now my tooth money was a lie!!!! Cue more pitiful hysterics from my shattered VERY DRAMATIC heart. \n\nMy dad  and mom apologized and thought I really knew. They said the loved me. I decided a few days later that we would still put up out Christmas stockings but I would help my  Mom pick out what to fill them with. By the time I turned 16 Mom just gave me money to shop not only for stocking stuffers  but also Easter basket fillers. It's a job I still handle for my family with pride. I may have lost the last of the magic of youth that day  but I gained a new sense of fulfillment  picking out presents for others.\n\nSo  whatever age you tell you older children it will hurt them especially if you tell them about the Big 3: Santa, Tooth Fairy, and Easter Bunny on the same day but you might as well get it all over with all at once.\n\n Remember inviting them to help search for the most unique, meaningful, silly, fun, crazy, favorite animal or sports team,  themed toys, ornaments, pens, collectables, socks, etc...helps them feel better and realize growing up has it's perks. And the happiness our parents felt being our Santas is the happiness we can share in as we pick out the funniest craziest inside joke gifts for stocking stuffers and basket fillers. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc95\n\nEdit: spelling", "Op is not the parent", "This is so beyond the pale to me. Lying to your kids isn't \"magic.\" There is so much real \"magic\" in the world... Why lie about a strange man breaking into your house and leaving things as a tradition? Men really do break into houses with kids in them, and there is nothing magical about that! What is the lesson here you are teaching?\n\nWe know the moon's gravity makes waves in the ocean, and it's still magical. We know why flowers bloom every spring, still very magical. We know why the sun rises and sets, still magic that we can see and enjoy every day! Learning about things like that is a great way to show that real beauty and magic exist. Even when we understand them, we can feel in awe of them every time.\n\nThere is nothing magical about lying. Ever. Especially to a kid that trusts you. Is the \"magic\" of Santa that their parent, that they trusted implicitly, lies to their face for years? And for what reason? \n\nThat is how the delusion ends. It ruins the illusion that you are trustworthy.", "I was harassed over still believing in Santa at eight by my cousins. The only reason I did was I thought my mother wouldn't lie to me. I found all my baby teeth in her jewelry box a month later. It's not a happy memory.", "I remember how I found out about the tooth fairy. My mum took my tooth, but forgot to leave a coin in its place, so she very visibly and unsuccessfully tried to get one out of her pocket in front of me, while she told me to go get breakfast, because the fairy was probably just late. I just kind of politely left her to do it, because I didn't want to embarrass her.", "SAME!!!  Santa & the Easter Bunny were figured out, but I held on tight to the Tooth Fairy being real.  There was just NO WAY anything but a magic creature could fetch my tooth out from under my pillow while I slept without me waking up.\n\n.... until I found all the baby teeth my folks had stashed away in an upper kitchen cabinet.  I think I was 12\u201013ish? I was hella bummed but also felt a little silly.  In the end, I'm glad my folks let me hold on to that magic for as long as they did.", "How'd you finally put together the truth?", "Totally agree. And god, the combo of finding out that her parents lied to her about something (totally normal to lie to a young kid about this, not normal if the kid is 13 and probably the only one in school who has believed in santa in the last 3+ years) that could easily lead to her getting bullied? That's hard to come back from trust-wise.\n\nTeenagers talk about gifts, can you imagine being this poor girl and making an innocent 'I hope Santa brings xyz' comment to friends and getting stared at in response? Even if that didn't lead to bullying, it would lead to a really uncomfortable, awkward situation. No kid (or adult) wants to be the last one to catch onto something", "So? It\u2019s honestly a little weird for parents to have complete control over what their teenage child gets to hear. Will they vet all books and movies in case one mentions Santa not being real? Lots of kids find out Santa isn\u2019t real cause someone says it around them. If my 13 year old genuinely believed in Santa, I would be concerned and disappointed in myself for not preparing them with the necessary critical thinking skills to function in society.", "It was a failure on the parents part. Would you rather your child come home sobbing because of kids at school going after her believing in Santa or would you rather she be treated like someone growing into a young adult and have it revealed in the nicest way possible? \n\nI have severe doubt the parents would tell her the truth if the former happened. At this point they\u2019re enabling her staying gullible, and it\u2019s ROUGH to grow out of that at a later age", "Y t a not your business the wonder of believingis horrible to take away from a kid who isn\u2019t yours.

I notice you didn\u2019t run it by them,", "Same", "I demanded recompense from the tooth fairy at 14 when the dentist removed 12 slow baby teeth (most still had intact roots and the adult teeth took years to come in because they weren't ready.)

We also try to have that spirit all year.", "I had an experience with a mall santa and my kids recently that for a brief moment made me think santa was real all over again.  I started to cry because of it. He was being so kind to my kids and then proceeded to ping things my husband and I had gotten or not gotten for Christmas as kids.  Like he legit pegged me as that girl who hated Barbies and loved beanie babies. It was like he was actually remembering what he used to get us for a moment.\n\nI never knew how much i missed that feeling until right then.  I learned the truth at 10 when I stayed up all Christmas Eve to prove he was real and saw my mom abscond with the cookies and mountain dew we left out for him.  \n\nIn retrospect, the Mountain Dew should've been a dead giveaway. \"Santa would probably like it if every once in a while he got pop instead of all that milk\"\n\nMom is lactose intolerant.", "Same. My sister (35), me (34) & my brother (25) would never say otherwise & continue to gleefully receive stockings & gifts from not only Santa BUT ALSO Mrs. Claus, the various reindeer, Frosty, even The Grinch year after year on Christmas morning. I love it.", "Yeah but you're also missing the point that altho it's a collective lie we've all spun to keep our kids happy. It's still a lie nonetheless and it's a weird thing to be black and white on. I also understand and absolutely agree with the whole taking a certain part of joy away from her. But this is where the saying \"ignorance is bliss\" comes in. High-schoolers are fucking mean. *Teenagers* are fucking mean. There's really no sure protection from either side. If her family or close relatives weren't gonna say anything, like everyone else is saying, the kids in her school most definitely will let her know. If she's really that excited for Santa there would be no way she wouldn't keep that to herself. I guess maybe it should've came from her parents at best but honestly it's not like they were really doing it ALL for her, they got something out of it to and that's keeping her obedient and doing good in school.  I'm not implying their intentions were malicious but I do think it's a tad bit selfish in a way because altho yes I see the appeal and I guess you could make the argument that there's no real acceptable age to break that news in, what's the point of lying like that. As a teen she's gonna see it as that...a lie... Tbh the more I think about this the more this collective lie of Santa being real is fucked up in its own way because it's not like there's a collective exit to ending it. It just sorta...fizzles out for some kids or it's spoiled and shattered by being shamed or told that Santa isn't real. It's shitty all around unfortunately", "I know that.

I guess at some point I just put it together. I remember talking to my mother years later and her funding it hilarious.", "That doesn't read like you want it to read...", "I think the giveaway for my kids is how forgetful our tooth fairy is..sometimes it takes a few days for her to show up.

I could have said their father scared Santa off. My niece suggested it but I swore to them I would never lie. So no Santa wasn't ever real besides the history. OP is not responsible for the kid and there's absolutely reasons a parent would do this. We just don't know them. I am absolutely not a fan of lying to kids about reality. I just also know that children hold onto this stuff for a reason that is usually trauma based. So I'm not going to rip that away without making sure the kid has other coping skills. You think Aunt here found out before classmates? That seems unlikely to me", "It read just fine. Your comment is whats creepy.", "Happy cake day", "I'm not sure I'm just going off what OP said. I do think the parents shouldve did it but judging from her story I doubt they were gonna. I guess her approach was the best way to make it easier for her niece and I'm glad her niece appreciated her letting her know. I read what you wrote thoroughly just was more so responding to the last part of your comment about her taking the joy away. I agree with your sentiments and OPs so I don't think OP is the asshole. If I was a 13 year old I'd rather hear it from my aunt than from the merciless teens who have zero empathy instilled in them. I honestly think and hearing a kid who still believes in Santa has a lot of more prepping to be done for them when facing the real world. It's cute but I can only imagine what other things that poor kid will be roped into."]}
