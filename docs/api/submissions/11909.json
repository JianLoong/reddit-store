Last Christmas Eve I was at their house for dinner, and she kept saying things like \u201cI\u2019m so excited for Santa to come tonight\u201d and telling me everything she had asked him for and wondering what country he was in at that very moment. She doesn\u2019t have any younger siblings, so it\u2019s not like she was saying this for anybody else\u2019s benefit. She is a smart girl, does well in school, and has no developmental delays that I know of. She just, for whatever reason, still believed in Santa at age 13. \n\nHer parents didn\u2019t seem to have an issue with it. They said they absolutely did not want to tell her the truth and \u201cruin the magic\u201d of Christmas.

If it somehow got out that she still believed, and she got teased or bullied, that could be brutal and awful for her. Wasn\u2019t it better to hear it from her aunt than some mean girl (or guy)? \n\nSo, a week ago, I told her the truth. I tried to do it in a gentle way, explaining that what Santa represents (the spirit of Christmas) is very real, but that there wasn\u2019t actually a guy with flying reindeer going to every kid\u2019s house in one night to deliver presents. She didn\u2019t say much and got a bit teary eyed. But she did reach out to me a few days later and let me know that she appreciated me telling her the truth. \n\nHer parents, however, are furious at me and not talking to me.

Pretty sure having reality check like that at 13 is gonna be easier than trying to explain to a 18y/o that you've been lying to her about Santa Claus her whole life. Was it your decision to make? Nope. Parents however can get caught up in the magic of having kids who still believe in things like Santa Claus and the tooth fairy.

I was always so baffled by how people could believe a man came down their chimney with presents. \n\nIt\u2019s actually quite terrifying when you think about it, a random stranger knowing all of your secrets all year and judging you for it?

Personally, while I do feel that the parents shouldn\u2019t have let the truth go this far without being told, but it\u2019s kinda like religion in that it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s place to tell them what to believe.

I wish I hadn\u2019t been lied to \u2018cause it was the first of many things that led me to have trust issues with so many people.  Now I\u2019m on an information diet with everyone except for a very small circle of best friends.\n\nBy doing what they did, OP showed the niece that she can trust them when something\u2019s going on.  To be honest I don\u2019t think she should be sharing anything with her parents that they don\u2019t need to know \u2018cause the parents lied for 13 years.  I certainly know I\u2019ll value my future kids\u2019 trust over some mythical creature we call Santa.", "It's a little different than with religion. With religion, I'd assume both parents believed the same thing, along with a lot of their community. Here the parents clearly don't believe in Santa either.

I have a real problem with parents encouraging a literal belief in Santa. It's fine to just go along with the stories for little kids but the first time your kid seriously asks you if Santa is real in my opinion you should respect that, tell them no, but ask them not to ruin it for other kids who still believe.

Kids in high school don\u2019t believe in Santa, it\u2019s developmental inappropriate, and niece is going to be in high school later this year.", "Because a 13 year old should have enough sense to realize that Santa can not possibly exist.", "I found out from a copy of Soap Opera Digest lol", "I\u2019m way too old to admit, but my siblings and I still \u201cbelieve\u201d in Santa. Every Christmas we are with our parents we make sure we\u2019re in bed by 9 so \u201cSanta\u201d can leave presents for us.", "Lol fair enough!", "Id say its because Christians genuinely beleive in Jesus. If Christians tell their children to beleive in God/ Jesus, they're sharing their beliefs.\n\nThe girls parents do not beleive in Santa. They are telling her information they themselves know to be untrue."]}
