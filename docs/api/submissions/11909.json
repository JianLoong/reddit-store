She doesn\u2019t have any younger siblings, so it\u2019s not like she was saying this for anybody else\u2019s benefit.

They said they absolutely did not want to tell her the truth and \u201cruin the magic\u201d of Christmas.

I tried to do it in a gentle way, explaining that what Santa represents (the spirit of Christmas) is very real, but that there wasn\u2019t actually a guy with flying reindeer going to every kid\u2019s house in one night to deliver presents. She didn\u2019t say much and got a bit teary eyed. But she did reach out to me a few days later and let me know that she appreciated me telling her the truth. \n\nHer parents, however, are furious at me and not talking to me.

Personally, while I do feel that the parents shouldn\u2019t have let the truth go this far without being told, but it\u2019s kinda like religion in that it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s place to tell them what to believe.

Now I\u2019m on an information diet with everyone except for a very small circle of best friends.\n\nBy doing what they did, OP showed the niece that she can trust them when something\u2019s going on.  To be honest I don\u2019t think she should be sharing anything with her parents that they don\u2019t need to know \u2018cause the parents lied for 13 years.

You revealed the man behind the curtain and did not let them come out on their own. They do have a right to be mad with you overstepping. Give them time and accept that you ended their time as Santa without warning. That was rude and hopefully they will realize that they let it go on too long.

We asked him how he felt when he got stockings (Santa only did stockings at our house) with surprises he forgot to ask for, or was his favorite things. He said that it made him feel good and that he loved the surprises. \n\nSo this most recent year (Dec 2022), we had him ask a couple of his friends secretly what they were looking forward to, their favorite things, etc. The week before Christmas we gave him an allowance for the 3 friends and let him buy a couple small things for each. Then we got him bags, and he hung the couple gifts from their doorknobs - signed secret Santa. I told him that the rule was you can't tell them who did it, and the joy comes from seeing them happy and enjoying their gifts. Now he asked to do this next year for the elderly neighbor that shared her vegetable seeds the other day for our spring greenhouse. \n\nI feel like OP is NTA, and the parents should have dropped small hints or idk something before he was this old and still believing.

And I felt indifferent.\n\nI'm not sure what happened in the following years but my brain somehow decided to backtrack. Skip to me at 10, writing a letter to Santa. My mom and younger sister must've made an offhand remark... I don't recall what exactly happened, but I vividly remember how I felt: *crushed*. They didn't mean to hurt me; they thought I didn't truly believe anymore. So I tried to hide my utter disappointment and humiliation, went to my room, and cried my heart out. Deep down I'd always known, but I didn't *want* to. I'd convinced myself the magic was real.\n\nI still thank the powers that be that this didn't happen in front of my friends, or classmates. That would have been so brutal. Also, there is a certain age at which, when you discover the truth too late, you feel betrayed. Lied to. It's a tremendous mix of emotions and not something you want to experience in front of your peers. Who would *never* let you live it down.

That every parent who does this happens to do  this so their kids have fun and are inspired to help others. We take turns as Santa because we want others to be happy. Added history. So they knew he was a dead Greek guy in a whole other time period that inspired the entire world. I did my best to make sure they respected others that didn't know and had a reason to want to be good. \n\nGuess what? You didn't protect her by telling the truth but took something from her that she's held onto for a reason. As someone who knew he wasn't real and didn't understand I hurt a lot of my classmates because I didn't know I was being mean. When I did understand I felt awful. Why would you want to take someone's joy? If she's this far from normal averages? She's going to get bullied anyway. That's not right but it is reality. So those coping things are important.

I was NEVER bullied. My friends never cared. I was sad when my parents said they were Santa. But I rallied! I told them it was OK. I KNEW the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy were REAL so I was fine. I thanked them and went to leave when they crushed my young naive soul. As I sat in the backyard sobbing and crying loud ugly tears my parents tried to help me make the leap connecting the Santa myth to his friends myth. I remember screaming,\" How could you....the Easter Bunny too? All that candy and now my tooth money was a lie!!!! Cue more pitiful hysterics from my shattered VERY DRAMATIC heart. \n\nMy dad  and mom apologized and thought I really knew. They said the loved me. I decided a few days later that we would still put up out Christmas stockings but I would help my  Mom pick out what to fill them with. By the time I turned 16 Mom just gave me money to shop not only for stocking stuffers  but also Easter basket fillers. It's a job I still handle for my family with pride. I may have lost the last of the magic of youth that day  but I gained a new sense of fulfillment  picking out presents for others.\n\nSo  whatever age you tell you older children it will hurt them especially if you tell them about the Big 3: Santa, Tooth Fairy, and Easter Bunny on the same day but you might as well get it all over with all at once.\n\n Remember inviting them to help search for the most unique, meaningful, silly, fun, crazy, favorite animal or sports team,  themed toys, ornaments, pens, collectables, socks, etc...helps them feel better and realize growing up has it's perks.

That's hard to come back from trust-wise.\n\nTeenagers talk about gifts, can you imagine being this poor girl and making an innocent 'I hope Santa brings xyz' comment to friends and getting stared at in response?

Most kids follow the \u201c5 by Sept 15 rule.\u201d And then there are other kids who don\u2019t start until they are 6. They might be behind a bit physically, socially, or developmentally otherwise.

Kids don\u2019t rotate through subjects by ability level but by grade level. So ALL third graders are taught the same math with the exception of those who need additional help.

Probably partly spurred on by lots of shows and movies in the 2000s doing the whole \"santas not real heres why\" and while they always had a \"but heres how he does it!\" I mean you can only get so many \"but heres how he does its!\" Before they start confusing each other lol\n\nDefinately didnt believe in santa by the time i was 10-11 if not a bit earlier. Since there wasnt any 1 moment of suddenly finding out i cant really pin it down", "Yeah, I remember believing until 6th grade bc it seemed like the more logical explanation until then. We had gotten a computer for Christmas when I was in 4th grade. This was the 90s so it was a pretty expensive purchase, and I knew we didn\u2019t have a lot of money, so I figured Santa must be real bc we could never have afforded something like that. I think in 6th my younger siblings started to realize he wasn\u2019t real and I just pretended I had figured that out already. Lmao", "I remember reading a story or post awhile ago about parents explaining to their kid the story of Santa Claus and that it isn\u2019t true, but that it\u2019s fun to pretend that it is. I still think this is the smartest way to play it. You aren\u2019t lying to your kids, setting them up for heartbreak, or manipulating your kids to act right in lieu of actual parenting, but they can still enjoy the tradition.", "This us what happened to me hahah", "I was 6 when I figured it out and it was hell for my mom.  \n\nI lost my first tooth, put it under my pillow, but the whole tooth fairy thing had not been properly explained to me.  I was horrified that she stole my tooth for a quarter. I asked what she did with all the teeth and my mom said she built her castle with them.  I wrote a letter begging for my tooth back, offering a dollar for its return (my dad had lost the tooth). I couldn\u2019t sleep thinking about her sneaking into kids rooms and stealing teeth to build her horror castle of teeth. \n\nSo my mom told me the truth for the sake of my sanity. Immediately I said \u201cso you lied to me. What else have you lied about? Did you lie about the easter bunny? \u2026.is Santa a lie too?\u201d I was so crushed by the truth that I didn\u2019t speak to my parents for a week.", "where in their comment did they say force?", "It's strange, I hear this a lot, but when I started to experiment with eating meat I had no problems. I didn't even know until I was an adult and had made all my dietary choices for myself that some people will have a bad reaction when they eat meat if they've never had it before.", "I think this is a case of YMMV - I\u2019m thinking of the experience of a roommate, also vegetarian from birth, who started eating meat in college. They definitely weren\u2019t sick for a week - it was an evening to stay in, but no vomiting, no symptoms the next day. I wonder why it was so much worse for you. (And we\u2019re close enough that it\u2019s not just that they weren\u2019t telling me - I know that\u2019s probably your first thought.)", "Yupp, some of my siblings were vegetarian from birth and will get violently sick if they eat meat. All of my siblings have made sure to feed their kids meat simply to make sure that the kids CAN eat meat.", "Huh, interesting. I definitely believed it for a few years. I'm not sure what age I stopped believing. I remember distinctly that I had stopped by age 12. I remember this because I *said* \"Santa\" at school - partly because my younger siblings still believed, and partly because I was unsure which of my peers did and didn't. I didn't wanna rock the boat if everyone else still thought it was real. And my friend corrected me to \"Your parents, right?\" and I *remember* going \"Yes, thank god we're on the same page!\"", "Same. We weren\u2019t raised religious so some magical old man was a bit suspicious even as a kid lol (as much as how interesting that would be if it were true). We weren\u2019t looking but found our presents in the basement as kids one year which cemented the Santa lie. We spent the rest of our childhoods trying to trick our parents into slipping up and admit Santa wasn\u2019t real.", "When they are old enough. Like I would not let a kid still in school risk missing school for a week just so they can get a burger. If they want to do that during their summer holiday and spend a week home, having some quality time with the porcelain throne, that's one thing, but during school time? Just no.", "I believed until I was 11 and this is what made it traumatizing for me. I was defending Santa and my parents on the playground and really struggled with the feeling of betrayal after continually confronting my parents. They lied to me because they thought it was cute. I\u2019m 34 and I still harbor resentment because I still can feel the shame of being the idiot defending Santa in 5th grade.", "I was thinking this too. If OP hadn't told her, the kid would have been told by a classmate and I can only imagine how embarrassing that would have been for her. Then if the classmate were to tell everyone about it and have it follow the poor girl through to end of high school. That stuff oddly sticks until you've graduated high school.", "I\u2019m curious what the going rate is nowadays with inflation. When I was losing teeth in the late 90s/early 2000s it was $1 or a few dollars I think? Though one time I lost a tooth while sleeping over at my aunt\u2019s and she panicked and dropped a $20 under my pillow. Which was fine because at that point I was like 10/11 and the tooth fairy was more of a fun pretend thing than something I actually believed in.", "That's why the big gifts for my son are from mom and dad and not Santa. I don't want my kids classmates feeling like that.\n\nPlus I don't want that fat bastard taking all the credit for the awesome gifts I picked out.", "I feel like my concern would be less bullying and more the kid just not having friends (without anyone being malicious). I was a generally good kid at 13 and I don\u2019t think I would have actively bullied a classmate for believing in Santa at 13. But I also wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to hang out with them, just because I would take it as a sign that we are at very different maturity levels and probably don\u2019t have a lot in common. I get that just forcing the kid to mature if they are less mature than their peers isn\u2019t the best solution either. But assuming she is otherwise on par with her peers developing socially and it\u2019s just this one weird thing, I can see the argument for what OP did.", "Yes. My niece and nephew when they were little. My SIL decided that her kids would never believe in Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, etc., and made sure they knew they weren\u2019t real. But that didn\u2019t stop them from believing in my friend, a talking bear who lived deep in the forest and made a magical beverage that tasted just like cream soda.  I was making soda labels for years. \ud83e\udd23", "My 6yo knows that Santa isn\u2019t real. She\u2019s known since she was about 4, and her best frienemy and my FIL told her the truth.\n\nShe also knows the Tooth Fairy isn\u2019t real, because we have her first tooth stored in our oddity cabinet.\n\nBut, she absolutely insists that the Easter Bunny is real, \u201cbecause bunnies are real animals!\u201d But the EB \u201cis definitely not the creeper in the costume we saw at the park! The Easter Bunny is a real bunny!\u201d Lol\n\nETA my kid\u2019s age", "I believe in Sandy Claws!", "That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve seen people in less fortunate circumstances suggest - make the big gifts from parents/family and little things from Santa.\n\nAnd you absolutely deserve credit for your awesome gift giving!!", "So my little sister and I were raised christian and when I was like 6 and she was 4 we asked mom if Santa was real and she told us in a very nice way but straight up that he wasn\u2019t and it was just a fun game because she didn\u2019t want us to think that she was lying to us and that Jesus wasn\u2019t real when we did learn the truth about Santa. So we got a quick rundown of what was pretend and what wasn\u2019t at a very young age and I have to say I\u2019m glad she did that and I do not regret that happening at all. She also told us not to tell other kids and to let them keep on believing, and when my sister said she still wanted to believe in Santa for fun we still did all the normal Santa stuff like leaving out cookies and milk and having some gifts from \u201chim\u201d under the tree, etc.  I really think that was an amazing way to handle it actually. But perhaps it did ruin a bit of the magic for my sister.", "I was raised secular and believed in Santa til 14 bc my parents got free presents from the food bank toy drive and I saw them as proof Santa was real bc I knew my parents couldn't afford these wonderful toys and my dad would spend all the xmas money on drugs.", "You know, that's why my mother never taught us that Santa was real. She taught us about the legends, and about St Nicholas, imparting the idea that Santa was based off of a real person, but now he's more of a figure of myth.\n\nBut yeah, she didn't want us to grow up, realize Santa wasn't real, realize our parents taught us to believe falsehoods, then question our faith in our religion and if that was fake too.\n\nIronically, despite her attempts, I still wholeheartedly believed in Santa until I was ten. I think, almost out of stubbornness over people telling me he wasn't real. Could've also been the undiagnosed autism.\n\nAnd equally ironically....I am no longer a member of that church. Nothing to do with the Santa thing, more to do with the fact that I'm a raging bisexual.\n\nBut my parents are extremely supportive of me, and my girlfriend.", "My parents did the Santa thing, but it was never about bribing us to behave well either. And they never went out of their way to convince us he was real.\n\nIt was more just a way to give us some magic in our childhoods (that we were otherwise sorely lacking - poverty cycle ftw). They couldn't afford to buy us expensive presents every year, but they could sure as shit eat some brownies and arrange the crumbs to say \"Thanks - Santa\", so they did what they could to make it a special time of year. I think that's how you *should* handle it.", "Now imagine if she'd followed that logic just a *little* further, instead of immediately rejecting it. So close, yet so far lmao.", "I've known people of similar age to OP's niece that still believe in Santa.  It's no where near as crazy to still believe 13 as OP believes.  Yeah, it is rare but more like winning 5 dollars on a lottery ticket rare not winning a million dollars rare.\n\nThe niece likely believed because she WANTED to believe in Santa.  It is a comforting thought to imagine that there is someone out there with superhuman powers who rewards goodness and opposes badness.  It can provide an air of order to what is a largely chaotic and depressing world.  There is spectacle about Santa as well.  OP literally describes her niece being excited about all the possible presents and Santa's location.  It gave her something interesting to talk to her family about.  It allowed for tradition to continue.\n\nOnce you've finally decided that Santa isn't real you are sounding the death knell of childhood.  Magic is fake, your parents are liars, the world openly rewards evil; it's a very depression place compared to Santatown.  And once you leave SantaTown there is no going back.  Some adults go absolutely crazy every year just in an attempt to try and recapture a small fraction of that feeling.\n\nIt is really shitty that lots of parents use Santa as a way to convince children to behave though Santa is hardly the only way most parents lie to get children to do things.  It's been my experience that most adults have at least several ideals rattling around in there brain that they just accept as true that in reality was just a lie a parent told them to get them to stop doing something annoying.\n\nAnd it's not really that hard to understand why she doesn't get teased about it at school... she likely doesn't talk about it at school!  Most kids don't openly talk about something if they think it will make them an item of ridicule even if it is something they believe.  If everyone in your class say cartoons are very babies but you have a cartoon show you love you don't stop watching it, you just don't tell people about it.\n\nSo OP, you overstepped your bounds and forced an unneeded change that couldn't be undone.  The parents suck for not being at all concerned and happy that they get to continue to manipulate their daughter though they also were likely happy that their youngest (maybe only, unclear) child hadn't become a cynical adult yet.  So ESH.", "Yes, Virginia, YTA.", "YTA, but so are the parents.  Question comes down to who's the bigger one.\n\n  You are correct about the reasons why you wanted to tell her.  However, it wasn't your place to tell her about Santa, it was the parents job.  They didn't do the job.  The ideal approach is to pester the parents until they see the light and correct their warped view.  \n\nYTA, but if you pushed until you couldn't push anymore, when you love someone, sometimes you have to be the asshole.", "YTA because you didn't let the parents handle it. A better response would have been to let the kid lead and to ask questions like \"Well, what do you think?\" and \"How do you think that works?\" and to deflect the conversation as one to be continued with her parents.\n\nI figured out the game when I was like 4 and a half, but our son still believed until he was about 8, and our daughter still believes or pretends to believe at 8.\n\nWhen our son confronted me with his understanding of the situation, I explained that we weren't just lying or playing a trick on them. I said that this was a tradition that older people have to act as the spirit of kindness and giving during the holiday season. He understood.\n\nBut that was a conversation for me to have as a parent. I would not want his uncle to have had it with him.", "YTA and it has nothing to do with if Santa is real or not. It wasn't your place to say anything. In a world that everything is shit and negative, what harm was it for her to believe in something. Hell people believe in God but yeah no that's real too right? Lol it wasn't your place.", "YTA simply because it wasn\u2019t your place to do this. \n\n\nDo I agree with her continuing to believe in Santa at 13? Socially with her peers, nope. She should have been told by her parents.\n\nHowever, boundary stomping into that territory makes you a dick and a half.", "YTA not your place if you wanna parent have a kid. Otherwise, mind your business and stay in your lane", "YTA because the parents told you not to. Is she too old to believe by most people\u2019s standards? Yes. Was it your place to tell her? No.", "YTA.\n\n>after agonizing over this for some time, I felt it might be necessary to tell her the truth, if her parents were refusing\n\nIt's not your place, you aren't her parent.", "YTA. It wasn't your place to say. If she had came to you and asked, then you could have said. Plus she was probably close to figuring it out on her own anyways.\n\nI believed in Santa until I was 13. It as such a nice moment between my mom and I when I finally asked and she told me the truth. You took that from her. Yes I went to public school.", "Unless there is any proof that she was getting teased or something at school, I lean toward YTA. \n\nNot bathing, clothing, or feeding a kid absolutely merits intervention. But this was not your call to make. That teary eyed moment was kind of stolen. \n\nI know you meant well and came from a good place, but I\u2019m 51/49 leaning on you shouldn\u2019t have done it without a deeper conversation with the parents.  It might\u2019ve taken a few conversations to convince them, but this was really their message to deliver.", "INFO: I might get downvoted to hell and back for this one, but would you tell a 13 year old who was adamant about the existence of a higher power, that said higher power wasn\u2019t real? Frankly, Santa is no more far fetched than plenty of religions these days. Where is the line when you can decide to tell someone what you deem is the truth?", "I vote YTA because there isn\u2019t an age at which anyone is supposed to magically know anything. Sure, other kids can be brutal, but that\u2019s also part of life and growing up that she needs to experience for herself as well.", "ESH \n\nMinus your niece. You completely disregarded HER PARENTS in what they said. Her parents for allowing her to still believe but honestly you suck more. Who was she hurting? Was she being bullied? Was she causing other kids harm?? You could have let her be. She\u2019s 13 and I\u2019m sure she would have gotten over it eventually but really you\u2019re terrible. I remember when my cousin told me at 9 that he wasn\u2019t real and it broke my heart. Doesn\u2019t matter what her intent was. Next time mind the business that pays you and leave kids alone.", "Gentle YTA.  I know your intentions were good but this was none of your business.  It was not your call to make.  I agree that 13 is old to believe in Santa (my kids believed really late but not THAT late) but at the end of the day, your feelings on the matter are irrelevant.  If you want to decide how to parent a child, have one.  Her parents asked you to stay out of it and you should have done so.  If my sister went expressly against my wishes on a matter pertaining to my children, I'd be pretty furious too.", "I kind of hate that this is applauding OP for ruining the magic and everyone\u2019s reasoning is because she will be bullied at school.

It wasn't your place to tell your niece especially after her parents told you not to. I have no idea when my daughter stopped believing in Santa. In our home we talked about Santa and once you stop believing you don't get Santa gifts on Christmas morning. Are kids really bullying kids over Santa? There are kids who want to be Jewish just so they can get gifts for 8 days. Maybe if we let kids be kids a bit longer our world wouldn't be so f'ed up.", "They asked you not to tell her, and your ignored their wishes.  Whether you agree with them or not, and whether or not you had good intentions is not the issue, and your feelings are totally irrelevent.  They are her parents, and you should have respected their wishes.  You need to apologize to them, and do not be surprised if they no longer trust you.", "I conflicted on this. I think you should of really pushed the parents with a fake threat of telling her if they don't do it. At some point, you gotta pull that magic carpet out and teach them what means.", "It's weird af, but even weirder that you insisted on parenting this child when you're just her aunt lmfao. Butt out", "You're the asshole.  You should have let her believe as long as her little heart could.  The world is a fucking cesspool.  You should have let her believe.

It wasn't until years later that I learned that phrase from a Friends episode, connected the dots and thought, \"Well, he could have just told me the dog passed away!\"", "Exactly, I think I read an little article somewhere once about some high schooler getting bullied for something that wasn\u2019t anything to do with Santa Clause. It might have been a one off, but I\u2019ll have to try and remember\u2026.", "Personally I don\u2019t remember having a specific moment where I found out it wasn\u2019t true. I just kinda\u2026grew out of it.", "Are you me? Cause once 6-year-old me put it together that bunnies can\u2019t carry baskets full of candy due to their lack of opposable thumbs, the whole immaculate conception and resurrection thing didn\u2019t stand a chance.", "There was an episode of Two and A Half Men about this, one of Charlie's girlfriends was a grown woman who still believed in Santa and was literally waiting around on Christmas Eve for him to arrive.", "Right? It\u2019s like, everyone has a potential to be bullied in school, but that\u2019s no reason to add on an easy target.", "My siblings and I would sneak down in the middle of the night to see if we could catch Santa. We never did, but we always managed to see our Christmas presents before our parents brought us downstairs. LOL. It would piss them off on Christmas morning when we weren't surprised by the presents under the tree. (There were 4 of us, close in age, so lots of presents). So they got smart one year (so they thought) and \"blocked\" us in. HA! We just quietly moved the blockade around and helped each other down the stairs. LOL. Then left a note that said we made it downstairs. LOL! \n\nThen one year when we were in High School we were enlisted to help Mom wrap presents, so My sister and I had to help with one sister, and then I would swap sisters, and this would repeat with each sister till all the presents were wrapped. Well, by the time I wrapped two of the same damn Kabboodle's, I knew I was getting one. Two of the same shirts, I knew I was getting one. Same makeup kits...yup. So, as I was opening them, I called them out. It gave my sisters the same idea, so we started calling the presents out. My Mom was like what in the hell?? I just looked at her and said, \"Next time you have us wrap each other's gifts, don't get us all the same thing!\" That stopped that! LOL!", "Me too. I believed in Santa until I was 13 just because I chose to - it made me happy. I knew others didn\u2019t believe in him, but I stayed quiet and continued to have faith in something that brought me joy. I have no regrets at all about it.", "Same here. The stocking and a few small gifts were from Santa, the big stuff was always from us.", "I'm so sorry honey. I hope things are better for you now.", "Look I'm gonna go with NTA - because it would be *humiliating* for her to find out at school. In my case, I already kinda knew Santa wasn't real at age 12 - but I slipped up once and *said* \"Santa\" at school (because I had lots of younger siblings, so my house still did the Santa thing at the time) and *that* was embarrassing enough. I can only imagine what torment a child would undergo for whole-heartedly believing it at age 13. In my country, that's high school age.\n\nThe Santa thing is cute and creates lots of good memories, but it can be taken too far and start to negatively impact the child.", "Right! Like, does this poor girl have zero friends?", "I made the connection when I was around 12 and my parents were sure pissed. But also they couldn't explain why it was incorrect.", "The parents weren\u2019t handling it though.", "Exactly. They LIED to me about this, what else have they been lying about. Turns out, marijuana isn't a deadly poison and doesn't turn people into rapist and murderers.  Learning the truth about santa taught me to question Everything that came out of adults mouth.", "Yes, this happened to my cousin. She found out about Santa and the bunny but no one told her the fairy wasn\u2019t real. Her parents assumed she knew since she already knew about Santa and the bunny. Well in middle school she lost her last baby tooth and was devastated the fairy didn\u2019t do her job. \n\nShe was crying after the second day of her tooth under her pillow and my aunt felt so guilty. She had just assumed since age and the other two mythical things out of the way she was in the clear. \n\nMy cousin does not do the tooth fairy with her own kids now \ud83d\ude02", "My kid around 6-7 said, \u201cmommy, fairies aren\u2019t real, right? Except the tooth fairy?\u201d", "My dad spilled the beans to my brother really young, like 4ish. He was so upset by it that when I was born, be was determined that I believe for as long as possible so he did all sorts of things to make Santa seem more real (my parents were happy enough to do the main Christmas stuff, but not things like taking bites out of the cookies etc.) I think I was 7 or so when I started questioning because Santa couldn't possibly be at every mall, so he doubled down and told me they were Santa's employees and they reported back to him. Then, we came across a Santa who had a real beard and convinced me that he was the real one taking a break to come see some kids in person. I still remember hugging Santa as tightly as possible and telling him how happy I was that I got to meet the real him, and him hugging me back and saying that he was lucky to finally meet me in person too.\n\nThat got me through another 2 years before the evidence got too overwhelming for me to believe anymore. My brother was the one to have The Talk with me, which I'm glad for because he also got to tell me why he'd tried so hard. Fast forwarding many decades, it was such a blast watching him do the same things with his kids.", "My nephew recently did this\nTo my sister, he\u2019s 11. She\u2019s afraid to have the talk with him though because he has a 7 year old sister and a 2 year old brother and he\u2019s at that age that he loves to do things to piss his parents off and pick at his siblings so she\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to say something to them.", "Oh I put mine  under the pillow but didn\u2019t mention it to my parents.  3 days later I mentioned it to my mother the the shocked look on her face gave it all away. I figured out everything else because of that tooth", "Don\u2019t feel bad, you weren\u2019t the only one! I was a\u2026 weird? 5 year old. Not to get all iamverysmart or notliketheotherkids, but I think that was the same year I came out of church with a real head scratcher about the whole Easter story. (The Jesus one.) They took it to my godfather, who is a Catholic priest, and he didn\u2019t have an answer, so they went to a friend of theirs who was getting his Doctorate in Theology at a Catholic college and *he* was stumped, and long story short I had somehow stumbled on a question that religious philosophers had been debating for centuries.\n\nAnd then on the other hand it took me hours to complete such complex homework was \u201ccolor the circle red\u201d, I had an uncanny ability to lose my shoes, and my hobbies included creating messes wherever I went and wandering off if wasn\u2019t being watched every single second.\n\nBasically, I was a fun kid to tell stories about, less fun to keep track of on the day-to-day.", ">I had somehow stumbled on a question that religious philosophers had been debating for centuries.\n\nDo you remember what in particular?", "My mom told me to be quiet when I said quietly to her that the guy acting as Santa for a Cub Scout event was someone we knew. Later she told me that some children believe in Santa and it wasn\u2019t my place to damage that belief.", "Trust me; I know how brutal kids can be. And just because your brother was bullied doesn't mean she would", "Just as hint moving forward--if you don't lie to your children from the start and deliberately set them up to fail, the magic doesn't have to leave in the first place. There are so many wonderful, beautiful things about the world that are actually, tangibly there.", "I agree.", "Just wait until the Aunt tells the kid the truth that the Easter Bunny and Jesus are made up too. The parents are going to flip out."]}
