Last Christmas Eve I was at their house for dinner, and she kept saying things like \u201cI\u2019m so excited for Santa to come tonight\u201d and telling me everything she had asked him for and wondering what country he was in at that very moment. She doesn\u2019t have any younger siblings, so it\u2019s not like she was saying this for anybody else\u2019s benefit. She is a smart girl, does well in school, and has no developmental delays that I know of.

They said they absolutely did not want to tell her the truth and \u201cruin the magic\u201d of Christmas.

If it somehow got out that she still believed, and she got teased or bullied, that could be brutal and awful for her. Wasn\u2019t it better to hear it from her aunt than some mean girl (or guy)? \n\nSo, a week ago, I told her the truth. I tried to do it in a gentle way, explaining that what Santa represents (the spirit of Christmas) is very real, but that there wasn\u2019t actually a guy with flying reindeer going to every kid\u2019s house in one night to deliver presents. She didn\u2019t say much and got a bit teary eyed. But she did reach out to me a few days later and let me know that she appreciated me telling her the truth. \n\nHer parents, however, are furious at me and not talking to me.

Pretty sure having reality check like that at 13 is gonna be easier than trying to explain to a 18y/o that you've been lying to her about Santa Claus her whole life. Was it your decision to make?

Personally, while I do feel that the parents shouldn\u2019t have let the truth go this far without being told, but it\u2019s kinda like religion in that it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s place to tell them what to believe.

I have a real problem with parents encouraging a literal belief in Santa. It's fine to just go along with the stories for little kids but the first time your kid seriously asks you if Santa is real in my opinion you should respect that, tell them no, but ask them not to ruin it for other kids who still believe. Your niece's parents are AH for encouraging/protecting the belief in a teenager. You are an AH because even though I agree with you that she needs to know the truth she is not your kid and it was not your decision to make.", "I know this topic could go either way for a lot of people, but my judgement is NTA. First and foremost, middle schoolers can be very cruel, especially the females. You just saved her a lot of possible bullying. Second, you explained it in a way that's keeping the magic alive, but at the same time, is telling the truth. And she even appreciated that you told her the truth anyway. Her parents are the only ones with the issue and the way they were doing stuff, it was gonna get her bullied.", "NTA. If other kids her age found out, it would be brutal for her. I\u2019m honestly surprised she hadn\u2019t already been told by other kids in school. At 13, it was definitely time.", "NTA. She took the news well and even showed appreciation for your honesty with her. People need to stop infantalizing their kids and acknowledge that they're growing up and dignify them with the power of knowledge.\n\nAlso, using Santa as an incentive to \"be good\" is insincere, manipulative, bullshit. Christmas should be centered around the gift of giving, not on consumption and this creepy dude surveiling you, policing your behavior, and breaking into your home to give you gifts.

It's fucking Santa she will figure it out eventually as everyone does.", "I'm torn. I'm not into the whole lying to kids about Santa thing. But I also think it's disrespectful to go behind their backs like that.\n\nI'll just say this. I'm a middle school teacher. I assume all my students know the truth about Santa.

She's not your kid, and there was no mention of her being bullied for it. It's a little cruel to extinguish a kids belief in magic. \n\nWhen I was in middle school, there was one kid who still believed in Santa. I think maybe he had some slight autism or something, but none of us bullied him for it, or told him the truth. Obviously, it doesn't always work out like that - but bullying policies are a little stricter at schools these days, so maybe it would've been fine and your niece wouldn't have found out.", "Oh my God.

You revealed the man behind the curtain and did not let them come out on their own. They do have a right to be mad with you overstepping. Give them time and accept that you ended their time as Santa without warning. That was rude and hopefully they will realize that they let it go on too long.

We asked him how he felt when he got stockings (Santa only did stockings at our house) with surprises he forgot to ask for, or was his favorite things. He said that it made him feel good and that he loved the surprises. \n\nSo this most recent year (Dec 2022), we had him ask a couple of his friends secretly what they were looking forward to, their favorite things, etc. The week before Christmas we gave him an allowance for the 3 friends and let him buy a couple small things for each. Then we got him bags, and he hung the couple gifts from their doorknobs - signed secret Santa. I told him that the rule was you can't tell them who did it, and the joy comes from seeing them happy and enjoying their gifts. Now he asked to do this next year for the elderly neighbor that shared her vegetable seeds the other day for our spring greenhouse. \n\nI feel like OP is NTA, and the parents should have dropped small hints or idk something before he was this old and still believing.

And I felt indifferent.\n\nI'm not sure what happened in the following years but my brain somehow decided to backtrack. Skip to me at 10, writing a letter to Santa. My mom and younger sister must've made an offhand remark... I don't recall what exactly happened, but I vividly remember how I felt: *crushed*. They didn't mean to hurt me; they thought I didn't truly believe anymore. So I tried to hide my utter disappointment and humiliation, went to my room, and cried my heart out. Deep down I'd always known, but I didn't *want* to. I'd convinced myself the magic was real.\n\nI still thank the powers that be that this didn't happen in front of my friends, or classmates. That would have been so brutal. Also, there is a certain age at which, when you discover the truth too late, you feel betrayed. Lied to. It's a tremendous mix of emotions and not something you want to experience in front of your peers. Who would *never* let you live it down.

That every parent who does this happens to do  this so their kids have fun and are inspired to help others. We take turns as Santa because we want others to be happy. Added history. So they knew he was a dead Greek guy in a whole other time period that inspired the entire world. I did my best to make sure they respected others that didn't know and had a reason to want to be good. \n\nGuess what? You didn't protect her by telling the truth but took something from her that she's held onto for a reason. As someone who knew he wasn't real and didn't understand I hurt a lot of my classmates because I didn't know I was being mean. When I did understand I felt awful. Why would you want to take someone's joy? If she's this far from normal averages? She's going to get bullied anyway. That's not right but it is reality. So those coping things are important.

I was NEVER bullied. My friends never cared. I was sad when my parents said they were Santa. But I rallied! I told them it was OK. I KNEW the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy were REAL so I was fine. I thanked them and went to leave when they crushed my young naive soul. As I sat in the backyard sobbing and crying loud ugly tears my parents tried to help me make the leap connecting the Santa myth to his friends myth. I remember screaming,\" How could you....the Easter Bunny too? All that candy and now my tooth money was a lie!!!! Cue more pitiful hysterics from my shattered VERY DRAMATIC heart. \n\nMy dad  and mom apologized and thought I really knew. They said the loved me. I decided a few days later that we would still put up out Christmas stockings but I would help my  Mom pick out what to fill them with. By the time I turned 16 Mom just gave me money to shop not only for stocking stuffers  but also Easter basket fillers. It's a job I still handle for my family with pride. I may have lost the last of the magic of youth that day  but I gained a new sense of fulfillment  picking out presents for others.\n\nSo  whatever age you tell you older children it will hurt them especially if you tell them about the Big 3: Santa, Tooth Fairy, and Easter Bunny on the same day but you might as well get it all over with all at once.\n\n Remember inviting them to help search for the most unique, meaningful, silly, fun, crazy, favorite animal or sports team,  themed toys, ornaments, pens, collectables, socks, etc...helps them feel better and realize growing up has it's perks.

That's hard to come back from trust-wise.\n\nTeenagers talk about gifts, can you imagine being this poor girl and making an innocent 'I hope Santa brings xyz' comment to friends and getting stared at in response?

Just like me, she was just excited to be a \"big girl\" old enough to know now.", "If you think most kids are actually losing their shit over finding out that it's not real, I got news for you... the vast majority of kids I knew and know, including myself and my little sister, were completely and totally fine when we found out. Actually, it was exciting, because it felt like we were growing up and old enough to be let in on the secret. We both understood that adults do it to make the holidays extra fun and exciting for kids. You people are honestly just really uptight and overemotional.", "I feel like there\u2019s different types of magic in the world and some of it\u2019s made up but that doesn\u2019t make it any less meaningful then the tides crashing or roses blooming. I\u2019d even say there are magical lies like when you tell someone you absolutely didn\u2019t get them that shirt they saw in the store but what do you know you did anyway. I understand not wanting to do Santa/elf on the shelf ect.  but if done right it\u2019s very much for the kids, my parents weren\u2019t great but they sure as heck weren\u2019t making messes and staying up past midnight to put out gifts after making a tray of milk and cookies (with carrots for the reindeer of course) for themselves.", "Really?\nI was sceptical from the beginning, I loved Christmas but I never really believed. \n\nSome of that was probably having a sister 4 years older than me. Because we\u2019d search the whole house to see where they\u2019d hidden the presents.\n\nTurns out it was in an elderly neighbours house.", "Idk, when I stared high school I was 12, but it definitely depends on the country.", "I was off a year entering hs because when I was 1st grade student my mother listened to teachers telling her i wasn't ready for 2nd grade because I wasn't socially active with kids my own age....meaning i had the academic skills i just didn't have social skills...because of that I was kept back in the 1st grade. When I found out as I got older I was pissed....by hs I still wasn't socially active and at 40+yrs old I still don't lol so it wasn't even worth it lol", "In most places in the US you *turn* 15 freshman year. But you usually start as a 14 year old, 13 if you\u2019re one of those kids that had a birthday in the summer and fall months. Kids with birthdays like those would either be the oldest ones in their grade or the youngest ones.", "So, for example, a school says to start when a child is 5 years old by September 15 (or something). But that is only recommended. So a kid could be 4 years old, not turning 5 until the spring, and as long as they pass the entrance tests, they could enter school. Most kids follow the \u201c5 by Sept 15 rule.\u201d And then there are other kids who don\u2019t start until they are 6. They might be behind a bit physically, socially, or developmentally otherwise. Or their parents might want them to dominate in grade-level sports (yes, this happens some places and is done by some people). \n\nAnd in some areas of the US, schools are quite small. Kids don\u2019t rotate through subjects by ability level but by grade level. So ALL third graders are taught the same math with the exception of those who need additional help. Given this, sometimes schools decide to have a child skip a grade to attend classes more along their actual skill levels. If they had entered school at the typical 5 years old, they then become young for their age level.", "I was a freshman for 4 years before they told me to leave.", "Heck, I know some non-NT kids who are making fun of the concept at that age.", "Autistic w/ADHD, so about as far from NT as you can get, and I never believed in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy, etc. \n\nMy Grandmother would pretend about Santa, and I humored her because it seemed to make her happy, but I always gave her a big hug and thank you for any presents marked \u201cfrom Santa\u201d.", "I brought up in a comment if the kid is homeschooled. That I can't see a 13 year old not piecing it together on their own, but that decades worth of media and pop culture and being around other kids should have made it even more obvious Coca Cola Santa Claus isn't real.", "I am not Neurotypical and I never thought santa was real.", "I\u2019m sure it varies from country to country, but it\u2019s a big deal here in Ireland too, so it\u2019s not the US alone anyway.", "The laundry fairy is so cute, omg. \n\nExactly. Most kids grow out of talking about it at school after like 4th grade, anyway.", "This is a lie adults perpetrate on kids.    \nIt's not really healthy.  \nIn nothing else (okay other than religion) do we feel it's okay to push beliefs on kids that aren't true.    \nAt some point they're gonna know you were lying the entire time - and then what do they think of you?   \n\n\nIt's honestly a prank that goes on way too long and can be awful for the kid.   And it keys into the stages of child development where kids do have magical thinking - and then grow out of it....  but some don't have an older sibling to clue them in - or a parent who finally tells them the truth - as they obviously should.... and this results - the feeling of having been conned and lied to.  \n\n\nIt's not a great gimmick.  It truly isn't.  \n\n\nIt's one thing to believe in the magic of Christmas and discuss that openly as adults - to talk about caring for fellow humans.  It's another to perpetrate a fallacy on little kids and then continue it until some wiser kid disabuses them of the notion on the playground.  You do this to some kid who is already unstable for some reason -  and it's really gonna suck.  \n\n\nThe very worst part?  All the kids who return to school and find out their peers got more and better presents and think it's because somehow they were better - not realizing that social inequality exists and it had nothing to do with their own behaviors!   \n\n\nMy partner still talks about the sub-par gifts she got as a kid and how they made her feel.  It breaks my heart.", "My mom was SO smart about how she explained the Santa magic to me growing up. She had a lot of several good points that made it so easy for me to believe her and not believe other kids:\n\n- If the parents don\u2019t believe, Santa doesn\u2019t come. That\u2019s why kids see their parents acting as Santa. But if the parents believe, he will, everyone still has to be asleep, though.\n\n- None of the mall Santas are the real Santa, that\u2019s why they\u2019re everywhere all the time, but they do work directly with him, which is why you can tell them.\n\n- Santa doesn\u2019t wrap his gifts, that\u2019s how you know if the parents don\u2019t believe in Santa, if they wrap the gifts, and then it\u2019s obvious that that\u2019s how they find the matching wrapping paper.\n\n- Santa also doesn\u2019t bring very expensive gifts in real life, if kids are getting flat screen tvs or Xbox\u2019s, it\u2019s again, the parents.\n\nShe had others, but she found an explanation for literally EVERY possible thing that could make you question it. I thought it was sad when the kids I went to school with didn\u2019t believe. They\u2019d talk about the reasons they didn\u2019t believe and I would just laugh in my head at them and feel bad for them that their parents sucked. \ud83e\udd23", "All of that still becomes on them to decide.", "I can imagine! As a child I was obsessed with the Neverending Story and my parents would write me letters from the Childlike Empress, so they still got to do fun glittery notes for me, even if the Tooth Fairy didn't pay off!", "I honestly thought op was going to say that her niece was home schooled. How does a 13 year old still believe in Santa? Did the other kids not talk about helping younger siblings believe? Or did she not get excited and ask the other kids what santa is bringing them and they're like wtf?", "What else haven't they taught her?  Easter bunny? Sex ed?  Real hard lessons of life like avoiding sexual assault?  Life skills?", "Yep this is the Santa Claus myth: a manipulation. It is lazy parenting of the highest order and in a 13 year old cruel beyond words.\n\nDo. Not. Lie. To. Children. Especially if you ever want them to trust you with their truth.", "I feel so stupid for this but I've read your comment like, 3 times trying to figure out what the flaw in your brilliant plan was and I'm lost. I can't figure it out and it's bothering the shit out of me lol. Is it because bunnies can't draw so when you saw the sketch of the bunny, you put 2+2 together and came to the realization that the Easter bunny was your parents all along? Or is it something else?", "Inflation is a bitch..even for the tooth fairy.", "I know more non-religious people that do the whole Santa thing than I do religious people who do. A lot of the Christians I know look at Santa more as the \"spirit of Christmas\" as opposed to an actual person, since they are focused more on teaching their kids the \"reason for the season\", if that makes sense.", "My guess is that the other kids didn't realize that she genuinely still believed in Santa, and wasn't just getting super into the spirit of Christmas. \n\nIt would be just as unusual for a homeschool kid to still believe in Santa at 13 as it would be for other kids, unless they're not allowed around any other people at all. Kids talk, so unless an entire homeschool group is conspiring not to reveal that Santa is fake, and also not allowing their kids around any kids not in the group, some kid is going to end up spilling the beans. Especially since a lot of fundy homeschoolers are super against doing Santa or the Easter Bunny and don't tell their kids not to be the one to reveal that it's fake.", "Parents teach their kids religions that are equally unrealistic, I guess the difference is that you won't get teased for believing that stuff.", "I mean, honestly what was the end game for the parents? She's 40 and believes in Sandy Claws (my pet crayfish lol) and does their laundry?  They sound like self obsessed AH to me, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's what their daughter thinks now too.", "Came to say this! Like, wtf? It's like those Christians who ask well, if you aren't christian/religious what's stopping you from raping and murdering and I'm like yoooo it's called a society and moral compass are you kidding me? I don't need an imaginary sky daddy who is somehow all powerful and knows all but requires begging (praying) and supposedly loves me unconditionally but will send me into a fiery hell for all eternity if I break the eggs I am forced to walk on whose entore book tp humanity has to do with murder, rape, banging your own daughters and siblings, which slaves it is OK tp rape and which aren't .... oh, and Don forget that pesky shellfish which will send me to that fiery pit along with oopsie, I wore clothing that had mixed fabric... that one book of magic, sorcery, witchcraft insanity that is a guide to humans but he didn't care to explain science, our climate and planet, technology or you know, anything that would actually help us. \n \n\nStop lying to your kids to conform them to morality because it won't work. Show by example, jfc.", "Damn you! I thought I understood the flaw and now you have me questioning myself! OK, the flaw as I see it is that it's a yes/no and anybody could circle the yes. So it could be the Easter Bunny or it could be the parents. But there might a different flaw....", "Fuck I feel you. I've had I think eight adult teeth removed due to small mouth around 3rd grade. I got one injection, the meds they gave me beforehand to knock me out/make me not remember didn't work. Fully conscious while they literally ripped my teeth out. They did two each visit and only successfully put me under once. Fuck them for making me go through that. Finally changed dentists last year, and holy fuck the new practice is so much nicer. Fuck that pediatric dentist though.", "By any chance... do you happen to have any red hair? \n\nApparently those with red hair metabolize meds faster than non-red haired people and need higher doses to not feel pain. \n\nMy SO always hated the dentist and it wasnt until his red beard came in that he realized it was because he has the gene.", "Our nosey ass tooth fairy is already a day late. She leave notes that let me know she hangs around and hears stuff. One note said she was proud of how my son was coming along with reading. Another asked about a specific book he'd been reading.  Once, she accidentally left her rainbow pencil out in the living room.  Smh. \nWhen this latest tooth came out, my son let me know that his friend's tooth fairy paid him in Robux and hoped ours would do the same.  At some point he then asked if I was the tooth fairy.  I think he's on to me despite my \"beef\" about how nosey and intrusive she is.  With that being said, let me get my wallet, find that pencil and write a note. (She was about to be 2 days late, but this thread reminded me.)", "Several years ago a former coworker who is very religious was talking about how surprised she was that her kid still believed in Santa, and thought that he should\u2019ve figured out by now that he\u2019s not real. I held my tongue, but I wanted to say that she expects him to take it on faith that God exists, but realize that Santa doesn\u2019t? When the kid has more actual evidence of Santa\u2019s existence (presents) than God\u2019s?", "Good point!  I can only imagine the teasing children of the Koresh compound in Waco might have had after rehoming and re-education.", "Well I'd say yes since the central tenet of the story is the 'nice list'. Why else would you do this to a pubescent girl? \n\nDon't get me wrong I am a Christmas elf and go all out with all the trimmings but I have never impressed on my child that Santa is real and would never make up a story around presents to bribe good behaviour. It's so yuck. We say Santa is a game.", "But what if the Easter Bunny had checked 'No'? WHAT IF IT CHECKED NO??!?"]}
