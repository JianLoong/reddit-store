Up until a week ago, she still believed in Santa. I asked her parents (my brother and SIL) if she was just pretending to still believe to not make them feel bad, or maybe to get more gifts or something, but they were adamant she still believed. Last Christmas Eve I was at their house for dinner, and she kept saying things like \u201cI\u2019m so excited for Santa to come tonight\u201d and telling me everything she had asked him for and wondering what country he was in at that very moment. She doesn\u2019t have any younger siblings, so it\u2019s not like she was saying this for anybody else\u2019s benefit. She is a smart girl, does well in school, and has no developmental delays that I know of. She just, for whatever reason, still believed in Santa at age 13. \n\nHer parents didn\u2019t seem to have an issue with it. They said they absolutely did not want to tell her the truth and \u201cruin the magic\u201d of Christmas. Plus they said it was beneficial for them because believing in Santa would encourage her to \u201cbe good\u201d in the hopes of getting better presents/not getting coal. \n\nI love my niece a lot, and after agonizing over this for some time, I felt it might be necessary to tell her the truth, if her parents were refusing. I remember how brutal middle school girls can be. I mean, she had to be the only girl at her school who still believed in Santa. If it somehow got out that she still believed, and she got teased or bullied, that could be brutal and awful for her. Wasn\u2019t it better to hear it from her aunt than some mean girl (or guy)? \n\nSo, a week ago, I told her the truth. I tried to do it in a gentle way, explaining that what Santa represents (the spirit of Christmas) is very real, but that there wasn\u2019t actually a guy with flying reindeer going to every kid\u2019s house in one night to deliver presents. She didn\u2019t say much and got a bit teary eyed. But she did reach out to me a few days later and let me know that she appreciated me telling her the truth. \n\nHer parents, however, are furious at me and not talking to me. I feel like I did the right thing, but I know it was against her parents\u2019 wishes.

She appreciated your efforts. Middle schoolers are fucking brutal, you're doing that poor girl a favor. Being labeled as the girl who still believes in Santa at 13 in middle school is much worse than ruining Santa for her. I'm honestly so surprised she still believes given how cynical kids can be nowadays, but to each there own. Is it cute that she still believes? Absolutely. However, if not now then when were her parents going to tell her? Pretty sure having reality check like that at 13 is gonna be easier than trying to explain to a 18y/o that you've been lying to her about Santa Claus her whole life. Was it your decision to make? Nope. Parents however can get caught up in the magic of having kids who still believe in things like Santa Claus and the tooth fairy.

I finally felt it was time to tell her (though I was pretty sure she actually knew the truth already and just didn\u2019t tell me), but it was very important that I told her the truth in a way that explained what Santa means to me and minimize the feelings of being lied to. And answer her questions. This was the parents\u2019 decision to make. If she was being bullied, she can talk to her parents. Did she ask them if he was real? Did she say she was being bullied? Kids aren\u2019t as brutal in middle school about this stuff as people think they are. My daughter was also not in the minority of believing for so long.

I\u2019m sure she already knew on some level, but I agree with others that you took some of the magic out of her Xmas. \n\nSpeaking as the kid who ran around kindergarten telling everyone who would listen that Santa wasn\u2019t real, I know what it feels like to want to tell. I was always so baffled by how people could believe a man came down their chimney with presents. \n\nIt\u2019s actually quite terrifying when you think about it, a random stranger knowing all of your secrets all year and judging you for it? Then deciding if you got presents or not? \n\nNot to mention the kids who didn\u2019t get big shiny presents like iPhones so therefore thought Santa must not think they were good enough.", "Not your monkey. Not your circus. YTA.", "NTA. going behind her parents' back, that's something that normally you should never do. Telling a younger child Santa isn't real makes someone an AH. But she's past the age it's not very detrimental to still believe in Santa and she's gonna be thankful years from now that you were real and told her the truth.", "Yep. I believed still in sixth grade. Kids made fun of me relentlessly. I asked my dad for the truth and he said \u201cIf you believe there\u2019s a Santa, then there\u2019s a Santa.\u201d So I went right on believing because I was a naive kid who believed adults were incapable of lying to children.\n\nThe next year, there were no presents from Santa and my parents told me the truth and I never fully trusted them again, because I specifically asked for the truth and they went right on lying.", "lol, you think the kid really didn't know the truth?  the child was playing up their ignorance to milk the gifts from mom and dad!", "I\u2019m not going to downvote because I respect your opinion but I have a genuine question - if you\u2019re Christian, how would you feel if an atheist told your kid that Jesus wasn\u2019t real? Or if you\u2019re an atheist, if a Christian insisted to them Jesus is our Lord and Savior? And all behind your back when you specifically told them not to share that belief with them? Personally, while I do feel that the parents shouldn\u2019t have let the truth go this far without being told, but it\u2019s kinda like religion in that it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s place to tell them what to believe. OP could have stressed to the parents how awful kids can be in middle school and implore them to reconsider, but I feel going behind their back is too far.

I knew Santa wasn\u2019t real when I was like 8 or 9. My family still \u2018believed\u2019 in Santa until I left for university. Because we loved the tradition and the fun of it. Even though I don\u2019t live at home anymore when Christmas comes around my mom always has one gift labeled as being from \u2018Santa\u2019.

IMO it might\u2019ve been rude to tell a younger child about christmas, but at 13 she should have the right to know esp when all of her peers know the truth. Even though a 13 yr old isn\u2019t actually mature, I feel like most 13 yr olds would probably feel insulted or condescended if their parents were lying to them for that long, but that\u2019s just my opinion ofc", "I appreciate your honesty and your respect.  Kinda difficult to find these days.\n\nTo answer your question with the same amount of respect you showed me, I was in the niece\u2019s shoes a long time ago.  In fact, I was 14.  I wish I hadn\u2019t been lied to \u2018cause it was the first of many things that led me to have trust issues with so many people.  Now I\u2019m on an information diet with everyone except for a very small circle of best friends.\n\nBy doing what they did, OP showed the niece that she can trust them when something\u2019s going on.  To be honest I don\u2019t think she should be sharing anything with her parents that they don\u2019t need to know \u2018cause the parents lied for 13 years.  I certainly know I\u2019ll value my future kids\u2019 trust over some mythical creature we call Santa.", "It's a little different than with religion. With religion, I'd assume both parents believed the same thing, along with a lot of their community. Here the parents clearly don't believe in Santa either. So the scenario is closer to how upset should atheist parents get, in a world where the vast majority of adults are atheist, that an atheist told their kid Jesus wasn't real.", "Not the same.", "Oh I get that the girl was grateful but you don\u2019t know that going in and it shouldn\u2019t be relevant in my opinion. There were actually a LOT of kids in middle school that still believed. I remember this because I never believed and was honestly a tad jealous.", "Thank you for your take on this! I appreciate your viewpoint.", "Fair point! Thanks for that distinction!", "What makes it different to you? This is a genuine question. I\u2019m not trying to be an ass (it comes naturally?).
