My mom was the executor of dads will, and he stated that upon his death, his money would go to his beneficiaries. My mom kept it in an account since then, so it's had 18 years to get interest. However, mom passed away suddenly everytjing was covered funeral wise under her life insurnance because it happened at her work, my brother has not released my half of my dads passing inheritance because \"technically I wasn't born and I'm not entitled to it. He called me an asshole because he has a baby on the way, and now im taking away from my neices future when I don't need the money because I'm joining the Army anyway.\" My few living relatives have also been calling me an asshole because im focused more on money that the grief of my mother passing and how dare I want to take my neices future away from her. \n\nSo reddit Am I the asshole for asking my brother for half of his inheritance.\n\nEdit in case someone asks:I already have a lawyer Mom had a will, but mom and dad's prenuptial side, any  monetary inheritance wouldn't go to mom but to child beneficiaries.

I'm all for helping family but your niece has less rights to that inheritance than anybody right now, that statement is only to make you feel guilty for trying to claim what is rightfully yours. You should definitely try to fight it, your parents wanted their children (pural) to be taken care of with that money and that includes you.", "NTA, how dare your relatives say such a thing. Your brother is TA , who is he to decide what is going to happen with the inheritance? Did he work for the money? You are also YTA only because you 'ask your brother\". Ask what?

Hopefully your free lawyer will make short work of this. It's hard to believe that your parents wouldn't have wanted it to be split.", "NTA for asking about it-or having a *lawyer* inquire about it. \n\nYou are just as much a child of your parents as your brother. So *what* if you were still in utero when your died??? You weren\u2019t a *surprise*! And so what if your brother has managed to reproduce?", "NTA\u2014 Not having been born yet at the moment he died doesn\u2019t make you less his child. In fact, you had less benefit from your parents support\u2014 presumably your mom already paid for his education and wedding if he wanted/she could, so I\u2019d say the argument that you deserve more is stronger.

The initial consultation with an attorney is usually free. As you likely don\u2019t have lots of money to pay an attorney, you\u2019ll need what\u2019s called a contingent agreement.

I'm sure at age 18, you can use some of that money to go to college and establish your household.   \n\n\nYour brother and relatives are TA for being so inconsiderate and irrational. That $100k if invested wisely is likely over $400,000 now. Make sure your attorney is a GOOD one.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd your brother is being selfish AF.\n\nHIS child is not your father's direct beneficiary. Your niece is your brother's responsibility, not yours, your dad's or anyone else's. And the fact that your mother hadn't given birth to you yet is legally irrelevant and a ridiculous argument. YOU are your father's direct beneficiary as much as your brother is. You are your father's child. And what you choose to do with your life - army, career, etc. - is also irrelevant. That money is yours, always has been. It's not your brothers to give you or not. If anything, as the executor it is his legal responsibility to ensure that you get your half.\n\nYour brother is either ignorant AF or just incredibly selfish or both, but none of his arguments make any sense from a legal standpoint. Of course you're NTA.\n\nI suggest that you explain to your brother that you are aware that your half of the inheritance is not his to withhold, and that his responsibility as the executor is to fulfill the intentions of the will, which is that BOTH of the direct beneficiaries inherit, and that his daughter has literally no legal standing in this matter at all. And that if he does not do this in a timely manner, you will be forced to sue.", "NTA. Your brother is just greedy. You weren\u2019t born before your father died so you don\u2019t get any inheritance? Nope, not how that works. (Tell your brother to research Jett Williams if he thinks that not being born yet will hold up in court.) Unless your father stated in his will only your brother inherits then he\u2019s not going to win. And is he really trying to argue that you aren\u2019t entitled to a portion of the inheritance because you weren\u2019t born yet but he wants it to go towards his own child that isn\u2019t born yet? Really?  Your brother is just really greedy.", "So your brother thinks your dad's inheritance shouldn't go to his daughter, because you weren't born, but should definitely go towards his daughter, who isn't born either? \n\nHard NTA. Your brother is terrible.", "NTA\n\nAsk your attorney to intervene.  Unless his will specifically only named your brother, you should still be considered a beneficiary.\n\nWhile you were not born yet, depending on the jurisdiction, subsequent offspring should be included.  There is a reason when you want to disinherit a child you name them specifically and leave them a token amount, usually $1, to show that there was not an oversite.\n\nYou have the ability to contest the will since you were not named and are a legal beneficiary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She should NOT have to pay 25%+ to an attorney. That's what is done for personal injury cases, not for an inheritance dispute like this.

I've seen it in a trust my grandparents set up - it was a 20 year thing, they were very well aware that they might pass before the trust matured and that it would make complete sense for my aunt to have another kid in that time.

They get a fee for the work.\n\nThe issue is most people pick a child or sibling, and if that person is dishonest they might do things in their own favor. Even if others think they are it causes family feuds.\n\nIf there's no will, the court assigns someone to handle the estate according to state law. Usually that ends up being a family member.\n\nHere it's possible the mother had no official will. The court would then pick a willing relative, usually the oldest child if there is no living spouse.", "Yes we don't have such laws over here, never a child or sibling becomes executor of a will or estate. It gets split automatically and an elder member, a grandmother, is forced to complete the process with zero rights on it. (That only if the successors are children, if adults they get it done on their own)", "Makes more sense to avoid bias. The US is very decentralized though, with a long history of leaving things in the hands of families and individuals.\n\nProbate judges are usually elected. In my state, Connecticut, they didn't even have to be lawyers or pass the bar exam until 2011. I could have run in my town and then made judgements on people's estates if elected.\n\nI could still be elected a Justice of the Peace but they no longer have any powers other than marrying people and taking oaths."]}
