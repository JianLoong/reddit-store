And the law should be pretty clearly on your side here too. \n\nI think if i were you, I\u2019d explain it to him like this, \u201cyou have a baby on the way now too. If you died tomorrow, are you telling me you WANT her to get nothing? Because dad knew I was coming, mom gave birth to me a week after his funeral. It\u2019s not like I was a surprise, so it\u2019s pretty fucked up of you to imply this is what dad would\u2019ve wanted, since he very clearly knew I existed. Look me in my eyes and tell me that you think it would be right if you died today and everything went to (niece) and nothing went to (new baby). Can you seriously, on your unborn child\u2019s life, tell me you think that\u2019s the morally right thing to do?\u201d\n\nBet he backs down. And if he doesn\u2019t, good thing you have a lawyer. And then I\u2019d try this tactic, \u201cyou and I know damn well how this is going to play out. The will states his kids are his beneficiaries and mom was about to burst pregnant with me when he died, so at the time of his death, he knew he was going to have two kids. A judge is never going to give you everything, and all that\u2019s going to happen is the assets are going to be held in escrow until this is fully litigated, so it will stop accruing interest. Mom\u2019s estate is legally going to have to pay for the costs in court to defend this, and so all you\u2019re ultimately doing is taking away money from your own kids with this act. You aren\u2019t going to win, and probate litigation is incredibly expensive. It isn\u2019t even unheard of for judges to make the costs of litigation come from YOUR portion of the estate alone. By the time that this is said and done, you\u2019re going to end up with tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars less than you would\u2019ve if you\u2019d just honor what you damn well know our parents wanted. I get that you want to provide for your kids, but that\u2019s what our parents wanted too, so be smart enough to recognize the best case scenario for BOTH of us is to just do what they wanted, and to transfer me half before litigation burns through it.
