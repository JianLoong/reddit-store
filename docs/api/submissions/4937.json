Dump this loser", "NTA - he is a grown-ass adult and should learn to support himself and budget properly.  For the record, it is a huge red flag if he is constantly borrowing money from you. Is he even paying it back?", "NTA\nIf he is in a tight spot then taking up a greater portion of rent and bills would be the equitable thing to do. What does he need thse loans for?", "NTA. It does seem like he resents you for making more than him. If he needed financial help and approached you maturely, I'm sure this would've gone much better. Plus, he needs to learn to budget and make plans to move jobs. Loyalty doesn't pay the bills, unfortunately.", "NTA and yes he is using you. Nip it in the bud and tell him you are not his atm. I would never be with a man that would do that. Or anyone else for that matter.  Your money is your money. He's gonna suck you dry then blame you. I think if he leaves that job he will not work and expect you to pay his way in life. He needs motivation. If  you pay his way he has none. I think it is a wonderful thing that you are doing for your brother. He is very lucky to have you as his sister.", "\nNTA,\nHe's a 34yo who lives with his parents. He can't budget or save money and keeps begging you for loans he won't ever pay you back for. \n\nY W B T A to your future self if you stay with him. Girl you deserve better.", "NTA, its past just helping him out if its every month", "He didn't support you. He paid for dates. It's not the same thing and it sounds like you have also paid for dates and other things since that time to balance the scales. Sharing finances as a couple can work out, but that has to be negotiated and agreed upon and it sounds like the two of you have separate finances. He's calling the money he takes a loan, but it isn't because from the way you describe the situation, particularly his reaction to not \"loaning\" him money, it seems he wants you to give him money with no expectation of returning it Again, if that's part of the way your relationship functions and you're both in agreement, fine, but that isn't the case here, and he is using you. I'm really wondering why he won't leave a crap job when there's a good chance he'll get paid better and have better working conditions, and what is he spending this money on that he's borrowing from you? I have to wonder if he's got a side piece. NTA", "Has he ever returned any of the money he borrowed?  If he hasn't, he is using you and using words to guilt you for his poor choices.  And how has he supported you?  Honestly you already know all these answers and your not liking what you may have to do next.  You deserve a partner that is actually a partner, nothing less.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. You do not one-sidedly use someone in a loving relationship. \n\nIf your bf refuses to pay you back, acts all entitled about new \"loans\" and is doing nothing to improve his financial situation, it sounds a bit one-sided.", "NTA It is none of your BFs business how much you spend on your brother. Why is it your responsibility to subsidize his bad decisions. Maybe he can't afford to have the level of loyalty he says he has. Why does he not see being a financial burden to others as being more important than loyalty to a business?\n\nI think in the end you and your BF are incompatible and from what you posted it sounds like you would be carrying the load financially for the both of  you.  I would seriously give some thought about what you want in a SO and what you want a in a relationship.\n\nAlso there is a fine line between being supportive of someone and enabling someone. Make sure you are not enabling him to avoid the consequences of his own actions. I don't mind helping someone out when they are working hard and come up short on occasion, but I will be damned if I will subsidize someone else when it is the choices they are making that puts them in the same situation continuously. They learn to depend on you to solve their problems instead of relying on themselves.", "NTA - Paying for dates is not the same as supporting your living expenses. And you said that you've been trying to pay for outings now that you can afford it so that shouldn't be a bargaining chip.\n\nHave you asked him why he needs money? Sat down with him and talked about finances? It sounds like you tried and were not successful. \n\nThis behavior of spending recklessly and borrowing whenever he wants won't resolve itself without work from both of you. If this relationship continues and you marry and combine finances, he will be the same and spend all of your money.", "NTA. Please tell me that you have each of these loans in writing in an legal agreement form for your state country Providence area. If not please do so now with each of them put in there payment schedules and whether or not you're charging interest. Get all of those signed ASAP. Fighting about money whether your friends relatives or partners is something that can be easily solved with having an agreement ahead of time. Whether you choose to enter in another loan agreement with him is completely up to you but having that legal form both of you signing it both of you retaining a copy of it keeping a digital copy of it on a cloud for your records just in case we'll put everybody at ease because everyone knows what the plan is. It sounds like it might be time to refer him to a financial counselor as well as possibly a headhunter both of those would be things that would help him to resolve this matter a headhunter to find him a better job and a financial counselor to go over how to be better in control of their finances.", "NTA- you have already helped him so much. its also his fault for being bad with his money, not your fault! id say bf needs to get it together", "NTA\n\nHas he repaid a single \"loan\" you've given him?", "Oh he DEFINITELY resents you - but is more than happy to take your money. OP, what does he contribute to the relationship?", "NTA. Never give loans to family or Friends, always its gonna be a Big problem when you finally have enought.\nHe is using you, he as the option to improve his income and dont wanna doit.", "NTA and this is definitely a red flag \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nIn the long run, is this someone who you can build a future with?

You mentioned he won't better himself too. \n\nYeah dump him", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t want to improve his situation by looking for a better job. He still lives with his parents so your pretty much supporting them too with your money. And he hasn\u2019t paid a single one back? Why are you with him?", "NTA.

OP should take great care not to get any deeper than they already are\u2014just in case things don't end well. I have a feeling asking for formal repayment agreements and turning down additional loans isn't going to go well", "Nope, since the amounts of the \"loans\" equal usually to one month of his salary, in the beginning I really wanted to help him so I never asked him to pay back, guess it backfired on me", "He lives with his parents, have talked in the past of living together, but he just doesn't like the idea of baby bro around, now, that kid is like my own son, he is not going anywhere until he is ready, so loans are for paying his own stuff", "Thanks, glad to hear its not me faking scenarios in my head", "Oh, I know he doesn't have a side piece, he just likes going out to eat too often and keep up with the advanced gaming stuff me and my brother have, if we have it, he has to have it too", "Have to be honest, in the beginning I just thought \"you are NOT going through hard times on my watch\" and gave the loans without a second thought....only getting angrier when they are becoming too frecuent", "Sadly, tried that...won't even send his resume, to keep loyal to his employer", "Nope", "Can you walk away from him? He is living beyond his means and using you to do it.", "He lives with his parents? What the hell does he need you to pay for if he's not even supporting himself?", "For starters, NTA \n \nHe's 34 years old, lives at home and mooches off you.  Are there any redeeming qualities? Doesn't sound like stable future partner material.", "It's mostly the comment about your wage combined with being a parent towards your brother. Plus, he's your baby brother who you helped raise while your boyfriend is much older than the 19 year old.", "There's a line between helping and enabling and also a line between helping and being used having agreements will help both of you be able to handle this with less frustration and animosity towards each other. Like I said doing those loan agreements first and getting all of those signed before you make any decisions about future loan I think will help you and your partner being a better mindset of how to handle the next few steps. Sometimes having it in black and white in front of you and realizing this is my payment schedule this is how much I'm going to need to start paying back every month might help them realize that they need to do something to change the situation ASAP. That's also why I recommended you know sending them to a headhunter and then as well as keep using the term financial advisor but there's another term for it but basically finance counselor to help somebody learn how to budget balance themselves their needs and what's a want. And a lot of times hearing it from someone else makes it much easier.", "Well again that's their decision but definitely get those loan papers signed with a payment plan and an interest rate. You're their partner not their parent not their ATM not their bank loan officer.", "Sounds like you need a better boyfriend.", "Precisely what I'm considering, but you know how sometimes people think they are not the AH when they are massive AH?, I'm not much of a talker in the real world, so I preferred to make sure here that I was not a massive POS for walking away", "He has a share on his parent expenses, as well as his own food to pay for, etc", "Always ill type of person here...perhaps too naive too, but he is always there when I'm too ill, which is why I have given the matter a long bit of thought before getting angry", "Indeed, and kid is not yet ready, I am certainly not abandoning him to help a grown man, no matter how much I love him", "> won't budget or save at all\n\nYou and he are financially incompatible.

The good stuff is not enough to stay.\n\nWalk away.", "You absolutely are NTA for walking away. I\u2019ve read your other responses and I fail to see what he\u2019s bringing to your table, except apparently good bedside manner?  He is showing you all of who he is - 34, crap job that he\u2019s satisfied with, living with his parents, no ambition, mooching off you. You say you\u2019re good at finances. Add up this balance sheet, and what do you see? I repeat: not the asshole. You should have walked away a long time go.", "And he's refusing to leave a job that doesn't even pay enough for that? I'm not trying to be a jerk but how is this attractive? He can't support himself, doesn't even try, is resentful of your brother, manipulative in that if you don't do what he wants he tries to pressure you into it by using other people. I strongly urge you to take a sheet of paper. Draw a line down the middle. Left side is pros, right side is cons. Which side is longer? Probably by a lot? Give that some thought. You sound like a great person who has triumphed over horrible odds, don't waste your great life you've built on this dude. I promise he's not worth it and your only regret will be you didn't do it sooner.", "I'm sorry to hear about your health.  \nBy 34 he shouldn't be borrowing money from his girlfriend on a regular basis when he's not paying rent or mortgage.  I realize maybe he pays something to his folks, but I'd bet it's not a real market rent. Just seems irresponsible.", "So you have a chronic illness, manage to work, support your brother and yourself and save and you think you owe this jerk for having been there when you\u2019ve been ill?  Maybe dropping the stress of him in your life will help you.   \nNTA", "Also chronically ill person here. Its easy to accept crap when someone provides comfort when you're not doing great. But this guy isn't going to be supportive in the long run. You're helping him financially while he pisses away his money and refuses to find a better job. Do you think he'd help you in the same way if you ended up in financial crisis because of your illness?", "Seriously. It takes a bit to get your footing, especially after high school.", "Guess I have stayed as long since he is always around when I'm ill (too often) and tries to make the illness manageable...but yeah, illnesses are expensive, but him?, a lot more expensive", "Yeah it sounds like once upon a time this relationship worked for you but it isn't anymore. It's ok to walk away from things that no longer suit you! There are other much healthier relationships that they'll be there for you. Without the drama and expenses of this one. Something to think about though because i know we often care more about our loved ones than ourselves... You are basically mom to your little brother, he is going to model his relationships based on his upbringing and what he saw and now.... You. Set a good example for him about healthy relationships, boundaries, and knowing when to walk away. Best of luck to you!", "NTA", "NTA but being 34 and living with your parents is a red flag in itself.", "NTA", "If the best thing you can say about him is that he stuck with you through a chronic illness, that ain\u2019t much. You deserve better than someone who feels threatened by your success and can\u2019t manage their own finances. Don\u2019t waste any more of your life with someone that wants to dim your sparkle.", "OP...this is the same story over and over. He has already shown you he will accept being underpaid and dependent on you. This will only worsen as time goes on....drop the loser NTA yet.", "NTA, I can see helping him with bills if you want to, but not big loans for personal items. He needs to learn to live within his means.", "NTA \nAre you sure he actually works anymore? Too much reddit stories where the SO leeches and lies to live comfortably and just gaslights their partner. Paying for a few dates doesn't equal hundreds of dollars of \"loans\" he doesn't even intend to return.", "NTA. Remind him that he still owes you money and it's not a good idea, financially, to willingly put himself in more debt. Ask him to start paying you back, and get him to sign a contract stating he'll pay it back by a certain time. He'll definitely refuse, at which point I think you have to admit that your boyfriend sees you as money only and disrespects you, and then you should un-boyfriend him.", "NTA\n\nThis is a 34 year old adult man who refuses to take action with his own career and who is resentful of your success.  Stop enabling his poor choices.\n\nAnd given his absolutely juvenile behavior of telling on you and manipulating you about this, you should break up with him.  He's not a good and supportive partner for your future.  He's an anchor who will keep you from succeeding in life.", "INFO - Why are you dating a guy that so clearly resents you for earning more than he does?", "NTA I\u2019m trying to understand where these \u201cfriends\u201d are coming from. How did they LEAP from him paying for your dates to him supporting you? That\u2019s a HUGE leap. Even that doesn\u2019t entitle him to your money. A date can be sitting at home, watching a movie, and cuddling in the couch. Sounds more like it was an excuse to go out to nice places so his parents didn\u2019t give him a hard time for blowing through money.\n\nI want to add that if he doesn\u2019t like baby brother around then your bf can move along. It sounds like you and your brother are a package deal just like a single parent and their child is. You got each other through hell, you got him out of hell, and you\u2019re sticking together no matter what. You\u2019re an amazing sibling!", "NTA. Girl get your loans back from him and dump him. The man openly resents you and you see a future with him?? What??? What kind of investment is this?", "Red flags everywhere. First of all, he didn't \"support\" you, he paid for dates - very different. Second of all, he's not going through \"bad times\" he has a job and needs to learn to live within his means. Sorry to say but he is using you & being rude about it at the same time. How dare he compares himself to your brother or even questions your finances at all?  Please don't give him any more money (and then see how long this relationship will last). NTA", "Not your problem. It is not your job to support him and his parents. You will never recoup any of these loans, you know that right?"]}
