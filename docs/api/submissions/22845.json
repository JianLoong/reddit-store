We make around the same money. We keep our finances separate and we each pay half of the rent.   \nWe are currently traveling together in a walkable city and we are living in a hotel. We don\u2019t qualify for the free breakfast. So we basically have to buy food from nearby restaurants because the hotel's restaurants are super expensive. I have to admit that money is tight, we can only travel on a careful budget.\n\nThis morning I got up early and went and got a nice but small breakfast burrito for myself. My wife woke up and claimed she\u2019s hungry and wanted to walk to a nearby place to get some food for herself. (Even when we are at home, we almost never eat breakfast together) The problem is that she demanded I give her a chunk of my breakfast burrito so she could walk outside and get some food for herself. I told her that I had paid for my breakfast and it\u2019s already fairly small so I can\u2019t let her have some, otherwise it wouldn't be enough for me. She said she needed to eat something in the morning so she doesn\u2019t \u201cfaint\u201d during the walk to get her own food, which I completely don\u2019t understand since she only needs to walk a few blocks to find food. I told her I\u2019ll give her a chunk of my burrito if she is going to let me have a chunk of her food once she gets it. She called me petty and just walked out.

We make around the same money. We keep our finances separate and we each pay half of the rent.   \nWe are currently traveling together in a walkable city and we are living in a hotel. We don\u2019t qualify for the free breakfast. So we basically have to buy food from nearby restaurants because the hotel's restaurants are super expensive.

My wife woke up and claimed she\u2019s hungry and wanted to walk to a nearby place to get some food for herself. (Even when we are at home, we almost never eat breakfast together) The problem is that she demanded I give her a chunk of my breakfast burrito so she could walk outside and get some food for herself. I told her that I had paid for my breakfast and it\u2019s already fairly small so I can\u2019t let her have some, otherwise it wouldn't be enough for me. She said she needed to eat something in the morning so she doesn\u2019t \u201cfaint\u201d during the walk to get her own food, which I completely don\u2019t understand since she only needs to walk a few blocks to find food. I told her I\u2019ll give her a chunk of my burrito if she is going to let me have a chunk of her food once she gets it. She called me petty and just walked out.

Low blood pressure is only really diagnosed when there's regular or serious symptoms or the pressure is like seriously low/abnormal for the person. I mentioned hypotension because while there's no history given about the fainting, it is important to recognise that hypotension isn't diagnosed until the blood pressure is very low/abnormal or there are symptoms.
