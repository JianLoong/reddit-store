He asked you to be honest and you were honest. You told him what he needs to hear even if he didn\u2019t want to.", "NTA. Because he asked. My parents had me in their forties too so I get what you are thinking.", "NTA.  He asked", "NTA.  You were initially circumspect and said nothing. When you did reply at his insistence, you gave fairly valid/logical reasons for your feelings, and it parallels your brother's plans enough that it is relevant.    \n\n\nI would ask him \"Hey, you gonna feel up to spending weekends playing catch in the backyard when you're 50?  Helping with homework when you're 55-60? How about being a soccer-dad when you're planning your retirement?\"", "NAH. Your brother and SIL have the right to have children, even though he is older, and you likewise have every right to share your perspective with him about it. I mean, it\u2019s not like you jumped down his throat about it. Your initial reaction was to keep it to yourself, as you only told him when he pressed you to find out what was wrong.\n\nI understand why you are looking at your brother and seeing your parents in him; seeing yourself in their future child. There are too many parallels for you to not notice and make the connection. Furthermore anyone considering parenthood should be willing to take steps to better their health if they\u2019d like to be a parent. Your concerns are valid. All that said, your brother is not your father. There may be a heightened chance that he is prone to the same genetic predispositions, and that he will succumb to them as your father did. That isn\u2019t a guarantee though. There are any number of genetic and environmental variables that can change that outcome.\n\nAs it stands now, you\u2019ve rendered an opinion and given him something to think about. It\u2019s understandable that he is upset. Hard truths- or at least daunting possibilities- are usually difficult to process. He\u2019s not an asshole for reacting negatively, and your in-laws aren\u2019t either. At this point, you\u2019ve said your piece, and now it\u2019s up to him to decide what is best for him.\n\nEdit: upon reading your replies to other people\u2019s comments, I see things even more your way. If their own doctors are starting to measure their lives in single digit years, then parenthood would be an absolutely irresponsible decision for them. It doesn\u2019t change my judgment, I still don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s an asshole for their reactions here, but perhaps my advice is a little different. You can\u2019t force your perspective on them, but if they come to you, there is nothing wrong with pointing out that parenthood is all about making the necessary sacrifices for your children. If they really want to have a baby, then their first priority should be adapting their unhealthy lifestyles so they can live up to the physical demands of parenthood and be alive to love their children as only parents can.", "NTA but not sure what you had to say was very relevant. Lots of people have kids in their 40s. Even if you think his health is similar to your parents, don't you think he and his partner have a better idea of his health and capability than you?", "NAH\n\nYou feel the way that you do because your mother died when you were so close to her at the time. Your brother doesn\u2019t feel that same impact because he\u2019d been well out of the nest by that point. Nobody got mad, yelled, did any name calling etc. you all acted like adults. I will say that \u201cgetting over\u201d your mothers death made me rethink this take but I think they were just trying to comfort you.", "What on earth did you hope to gain by saying this? Do you just not want your brother to have a family because your parents are deceased? We\u2019re you informing him because he didn\u2019t know why your parents died? Like you were trying to alert him with information he didn\u2019t have? To change his mind?", "NAH, but you should apologize. I get wherw you are coming from but theres not really any reason to assume he will get sick and die young. He's in similar health but hes not sick and if his wife is healthy than the chances are lower. It was rude to imply he was going to mess up his kids and die young, but i under you are worried about someone going through something like that.

You can image why I worry when I see both my brother and SIL exactly like this and discussing a child.", "Well, first he asked.\n\nSecondly, I mentioned this to him because he was not involved in our parents' lives or their cares in their later years. He was given a very different childhood so I don't think he ever realized how much we all struggled due to their health issues. He was a couple states away.\n\nThirdly and honestly, I don't think any child should have to be wiping their parent's bum at 9 because the parented decided to drink and neglect themself. Do I know if this would happen to his potential child? No. At the same time, his health is no different from theirs and I think it's unfair to bring a child into the world when doctor's don't think you'll be alive in the next 10 years.", "[deleted]", "But is your brother\u2019s (and his wife\u2019s) health currently the same as your parents\u2019 when they had you? Or is his age just triggering your own personal trauma??", "It's also a sore subject for OP though seemingly. They had vastly different childhood experiences and from the info provided and the comments it does sound like their brothers kids may end up having similar experiences to OP so I don't blame them for pointing out that possibility to their brother when pressed (OP didn't push this on their brother, he asked)", "To be honest, it would have just been better if he hadn't asked!", "From what he's told me, and what I see, they're pretty similar. He usually says, 'yeah I drink as much as dad, smoke as much as mom'. He also tells me how much the doctor warns them on their weight (both morbidly obese, as were our parents) and potential problems if they don't change. But, like our parents, they never follow the advice given (something he has also openly admitted to me).", "You know what, then I change my opinion to NTA - in the OP it sounds too much like unresolved trauma but it really looks like history could repeat itself (and I\u2019m very sorry for what you\u2019ve been through!). I suggest adding more info to your post so people could understand better! \n\nNo children should be born to parents that care this little about their own health, even for their own children.", "NTA. He may not like what you had to say but it's true. If people want to drink and smoke and eat themselves to death, that is their choice. But it's selfish to bring a child into that who has no say in the matter.\n\nMy grandma died at 66 after smoking all her life and years of declining health. Her oldest was 43, her youngest only 22. I was 9 when she died and most of my memories of her were her out of breath while chain smoking. I'm sure that wasn't the mom she was to her oldest, but it definitely was to her youngest.", "NTA\n\nEven your brother's MIL wrote you?  Jeebus, talk about enmeshed.\n\nWrite back to all of them.  \"Unless you were all barely adults when both your parents died, you don't have any idea what it was like to be 20 and alone.  Don't dismiss my reality for your magical thinking or offer platitudes about how much my mom loved me like it makes all the pain vanish.  \n\n\"You all free to think what you want, but you owe me an apology for trying to pretend I didn't live what I lived.\"", "It\u2019s not a question of if your mother loved you or not. It\u2019s that you were made into a caregiver at a very young age & never really got to be a child, then you were barely an adult when she passed away. \n\nIt might be better to clarify that you have no doubt your brother will love his child, you would just recommend he ensures he has something in place so his child doesn\u2019t have to go through that. Based on family history, it would be irresponsible for him not to anyway.", "NTA your brother got to have two parents who were young and healthy enough to look after a child. You got to grow up being a carer for one older, disabled parent. \n\nYour brother and his wife have every legal right to try for a baby. He asked for your *honest* opinion and you reminded him that both of your parents died relatively young and allowed him to connect the dots. Kids don\u2019t ask to be born - other people choose to make them, and often for pretty selfish, narcissistic reasons. \n\nIf your brother isn\u2019t mature enough to have a serious discussion about who will look after his kids if he or his wife dies, then he\u2019s not mature enough to have a kid in the first place.", "NTA. You were being honest like he asked. I'm pregnant and 40, but I've taken care of myself and so has my husband. Neither one of us has existing health conditions, we're both very active and we both eat pretty healthy. I wouldn't have gotten pregnant if I had pre-existing health conditions that would interfere with me being a good parent to my child. It's irresponsible to bring life into this world if you can't even bother to take care of yourself.", "So who's going to be taking care of this child if/when your brother dies early?   Can his wife handle this alone?  Has he set up accounts/trusts/insurance to offset the burden?", "NTA. He asked, you answered. If he continues to be upset about it, ask him exactly who is supposed to care for this child if he dies? Is his wife healthy enough to do so on her own? If both of them die? Where was he when you were a kid and why did it fall on you to care for your mother?\n\nAlso, SIL and her mother are way out of line. Love isn't always enough. You were put in a situation no young child should be in--caring for a parent when they should have been caring for you. Honestly, who cares if she loved you because you were still neglected and forced into a role that shouldn't have been your responsibility, losing your childhood to it. And I'm not saying she didn't love you, just that love ISN'T all you need, especially as a child. I'm appalled at those two as much as I am your brother.", "NTA. My parents were 43 when they had me. But they both won the genetic lottery and are still in amazing physical and mental health. It is not something that the average person should do without consideration of their lifestyle and health. And ultimately, my parents will die earlier than I am prepared to grieve them, and that is a hard thing to know. It was also hard to make friends growing up when my parents were uninterested in the other kids' parents and didn't relate to them. \n\nThere are lots of benefits to being an older parent too (maturity, greater wealth, stability) which did set me up for greater success than my peers - but it's a gamble. You were right to counsel your brother as you did, based off his health and family history. I can only hope he takes it seriously. I'm sure he would love his child for the brief time he could be around, but that is not much comfort to a fatherless kid.", "NAH. It makes sense his plans aren't sitting well with you. It's also hard to opine without knowing the health context (not asking you to disclose,  just noticing this changes how the chips fall) but it's not a guarantee that the past repeats itself.  \n\n\n\nLosing a parent is hard enough.  Being in a caregiver role for a parent can be damn hard.  And being in that caregiver role as a kid is rough. Wishing the best for alla yas.", "NTA your mom made you care for her when you were a child, that\u2019s not right or fair and you were justified letting your brother know the real situation you lived.", "**NTA**   Your brother's in-laws had a lot of nerve though to even contact you about this.   They never knew your mother, the platitudes about her bravery and love were totally inappropriate.   If I were you I would send brother a message asking him to keep his in-laws out of your business.    You may also emphasize that he wasn't there when you were a minor and the primary care-giver for your mother.", "NAH,\n\nBut, please be aware that 40\u2019s isn\u2019t considered particularly old for having children nowadays. Medical science has advanced quite a bit. People are fertile (or assisted fertile) for longer, people with chronic, genetic, or lifestyle factor illnesses are living longer when managed appropriately. \n\nYou had a terrible hand dealt, but you can\u2019t assume the same will carry forward. Also, for many people having children is the most important thing they can imagine, even when they know there may be difficulties or their time will be cut short. (As seen in situations where people decline cancer treatment so they can maintain a pregnancy, for example.) \n\nYour opinion may be relevant to you- but not necessarily the people around you. \n\nYour family members can seek genetic counseling and potentially selective fertility assistance that can minimize any risk of passing on fatal genes. \n\nIf OP is willing to answer, what genetic factor illness are you referring to? Something completely genetic like ALS or Tay-Sachs or something treatable\nLike CAD, type 2 diabetes or obesity?", "NTA. \n\nPeople thinking of becoming parents at the 40+ range really do need to think about the long term implications. \n\nRemember you're creating a whole human, not just a baby. Not just an accessory.", "My mom was 40 when I was born (turned 41 later that year). My dad was 37. My mother took a nap most afternoons. She would sometimes take us places and stay in the car while we played  and she dozed. My dad would sometimes spend a short time tossing me a softball, but not nearly as often as I would have liked.

Physical health isn\u2019t the only thing you have to worry about. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to keep up with a young kid in your 40s and 50s, but consider what\u2019s gonna happen when you can\u2019t handle being in the car long enough to make the drive to visit that kid in college. \n\nI know there\u2019s always a risk of losing your parents young, but every parent should weigh the probability when they are considering having children.", "OP's reasons regarding their parents health are are valid and understandable. But I don't see the issue generally with parenting a child  in 40s and 50s, plenty of people do it, including my parents with my brother and the parents of 4 different close friends. If someone late 40s onwards was planning a child then they really should take these age factors into consideration but I think it's much less of an issue if a child would be late teens when the parents turn 60.", "Sounds like it\u2019s more about health than age. From some of OPs replies the parents did not take of themselves and the brother refuses to live healthier despite wanting a kid. My dad was almost 40 when I was born, I\u2019m almost 30 now and he\u2019s healthier than most people my age. He takes really good care (eats healthy, exercise, ect\u2026) of himself because his parents unfortunately died youngish (50s and 60s) and he didn\u2019t want to put me through that. If the brother wants to have that\u2019s his choice but he really should break the cycle and make some lifestyle changes.", "Exactly! Very selfish to have a kid while refusing to take care of yourself, forcing them to. It\u2019s already selfish to do this when you have a medical condition that can\u2019t be helped. But it sounds like OPs brother could have a longer life but refuses to change his lifestyle. What did he think the response would be and why push for an answer when OP initially stayed out of it?", "Sounds like it\u2019s more about health than age. From some of OPs replies the parents did not take of themselves and the brother refuses to live healthier despite wanting a kid. If the brother wants to have a kid that\u2019s his choice but he really should break the cycle and make some lifestyle changes. Seems kinda selfish to have a kid while refusing to take care of yourself, forcing them to.", "OP's reply to another comment:\n\n\"From what he's told me, and what I see, they're pretty similar. He usually says, 'yeah I drink as much as dad, smoke as much as mom'. He also tells me how much the doctor warns them on their weight (both morbidly obese, as were our parents) and potential problems if they don't change. But, like our parents, they never follow the advice given (something he has also openly admitted to me).\"", "I wonder if they would be interested in fostering/ adopting an older kid/ teen instead. So many need homes, people always want babies instead. Though considering the health issues even an older kid could end up in the same situation. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think they know deep down that this is a bad idea. Just wanted OP to resolve them of guilt.", "35 is a bit young. It starts to raise concerns when both the patents hit 40 at birth of their child. I'm no way denying your experience though.", "Key word is healthy. OP's brother and SIL are in poor health and actively disregarding doctor's recommendations to improve. That \"what if\" scenario them dying and leaving behind their young child at barely into adulthood seems more like a self fulfilling prophecy compared to the chances they will fix their health issues before it's too late.", "She sees that her brother is likely on the same page health wise as what her parents were when they had her and being a carer of a parent at such a young age and then both parents being gone by 19 is quite tragic and traumatic. Brother asked and she was honest. As OP stated multiple times it's about health and not about age and if her brother was healthy with no underlying conditions and not susceptible to genetic conditions it sounds like she wouldn't give a fig about her brother having a baby. \n\nTo be honest having a baby at that age with his health sounds like he's grasping at legacy before he gets too ill or passes which is pretty selfish.", "[deleted]", "What should she apologize for? Answering his question honestly?", "My FIL had a child at 63 and very soon after became bedbound. He died at 68. The boys mother died at 42 - the boy was only 3. Both parents were alcoholics and had COPD and the little boy was a surprise and they didn\u2019t mend their ways at all. She drank 12 cans of beer a day whilst pregnant with him, she told me. \n\nHe was an orphan at 5. Thankfully, he\u2019s just been adopted by a lovely couple and now has siblings too.", "My dad had my youngest brother at 38, and he died at 57, my brother was 19. (I was 27,and mt other brother was 23).\nWe were just unlucky, my Dad had an athlete body, exceptional physical condition and health, never smoked, nore drank. But he lost the cancer lottery and a pancreatic cancer killed him in 6 months. \n\nIt's true that if he had had his last son earlier he could have had a few more years with him, but he could also have lived another 20 or even 30 years in stellar health. Life can be a bitc*.", "No joking. My family all have diabetes, bad eyesight and tend to get cancer.", "My dad is much younger than my mom, but still she had me (the oldest) at 40.   \n\nI'm mid-30s now and I can't imagine chasing a kid with my bad back.   40 and 45 had to be rough.", "Seeing this in my own family now. Plenty of healthy and active 70+ year olds but my own parents are extremely frail.", "Yea, but apparantly this guy is in his forties *and in poor health, just like their parents*\n\nThe health is the issue, not just the age.", "And OP isn't saying ALL people in their 40s or older shouldn't or can't be parents and good ones at that. My parents were in their 40s when all my siblings were born. To this day (they're in their 70s) they're active and able to keep up with the grandkids. Your comment has absolutely no bearing on the situation presented in OPs post beyond \"but not everyone...\" We know. In this case, though, the person in question probably *should not* be having a child at the age he is.", "OP has stipulated that his brother has health problems like his parents that include mobility. He even stipulated it's specifically his brother's health *not his age* that he is concerned with.", "I'm 1000% on your side and was in a similar position...I won't get into it, but it caused trauma and ruined my health and my youth.  I wouldn't want any child to have to go through that.  You're right to be concerned for health reasons.", "I am sorry you went through that. I am also sorry your adult brother couldn't be bothered to help step in when you were a child and had to do things no child should have to do, period.", "I'm so sorry you went through that. I hope your brother changes his lifestyle so you can have him around for many more years.", "oh ok I was thinking getting upset with someone having a child at age 40 and calling them selfish was a bit of a reach at first but with this further context about the lifestyle issues it makes more sense.", "[deleted]", "When someone says they want kids implying that they are going to get sick and mess up their kids lifes by forcing them into being a care taker isn't cool. It was honest, but it was still rude. It can be both. She also didn't say he was sick, just in similar health. There isn't really a reason to assume that would happen, or even be weird about it on the phone. They don't talk very much and it just wasn't a nice thing to say", "I\u2019m so happy he\u2019s with a good family now, I hope he\u2019s not traumatized. Some people are so irresponsible.", "I wasn't disagreeing with OP, I said their concerns were understandable. I was disagreeing with the person above who raised general concerns about parenting in 40s and 50s - helping with homework at 55 etc. The issues in this case are around health, not people in their 40s having babies generally.", "Yes. Which is why I said that the *OP's* concerns regarding health were completely understandable. I disagreed with the age-based concerns raised in the comment I *directly* replied to. Did my comment show upon its own without the comment I replied to?", "he did already in a comment. maybe after your answ.  but they seem to be obese.. and heavy drinkers", "Or you could believe them when they say their brother is similarly unhealthy.", "Off topic but people on Reddit do this sometimes where they glaze over the qualifier in your comment and \u201cwell actually\u201d the rest of it. Just popping in to help you feel seen lol", "I\u2019m sympathetic to u/Mother_Tradition_774\u2019s point about parents-to-be or prospective-parents being constantly judged by society. However, this is not that, IMO. Your brother, OP, asked, and you have valuable insight (as well as trauma) that he absolutely can benefit from knowing. You are not a stranger offering a generic and unsolicited opinion, and that puts you in a whole other category (IMO). \n\nIf I\u2019m math-ing right, your parents died just a couple of years ago. Your brother\u2019s absence is interesting - he knew he had a minor sibling and ill parents (presumably) and he elected not to be more present or send help (even emotional support and advice). I don\u2019t know if the term \u201cparentification\u201d applies when you are parenting your own parents rather than their other children, but you seem to have been pretty much abandoned by your parents and brother both, in various ways. Surely your parents didn\u2019t want to be in failing health or die, and the progression of this situation wasn\u2019t necessarily reflective of them being \u201cbad\u201d people - most of us have bad and good all wrapped up within ourselves and part of grief counseling can be acknowledging both their imperfection and our own, along with learning to treat ourselves and our feelings as valid and okay. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely okay for you to have feelings about your childhood, and it is also reasonable to share your concerns with your family member *especially because he asked directly.*\n\nIt is also okay for your brother to decide he disagrees. And even to be upset and share that with his partner. I lose all sympathy when he (or she) apparently *told on you* to his in-laws, who then felt it was appropriate to *reach out to chastise you directly for your valid and requested opinion based on experience.* Where were these people when you were living this difficulty in real time? What right do they have to stick their nose in? \n\nLast opinion: having children should not be about fulfilling the parents. It\u2019s about choosing to create a life and then nourishing that life. The child will deserve to be the priority once they are born, and from my third party perspective based on your post, it seems to me that your brother doesn\u2019t have a great track record of putting others\u2019 needs ahead of his own. That\u2019s not intrinsically bad, but it *may* be incompatible with parenthood specifically. Is there any chance he *did* understand how much you were playing nurse / home healthcare aide and is possibly considering that having a child will be good insurance for his own future care? This may be 100% off base, and if so I\u2019m so sorry, but his focus on himself and lack of awareness of others\u2019 needs makes me slightly concerned.\n\nETA: missed formatting", "I would add an edit to your post including this information. Very important context to the situation. Makes your reasoning crystal clear. Definitely sounds like it\u2019s more about lifestyle and health than age. It also sounds like your brother is using you to resolve his own guilt. I think he knows deep down he\u2019s making the same mistake as your parents by refusing to get a hold of his health.", "This should be the top comment in my opinion! I agree with everything you said. NTA"]}
