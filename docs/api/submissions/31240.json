I was very young when this all occurred and still struggle losing them so young. My brother (42) wants to try for a child. I wasn't going to say anything, but he asked and I admitted that they were both young when they died, so was I, and to at least consider the impact it may have his possible child. His MIL and wife think I'm doing this due to resentment towards my own parents.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He asked you to be honest and you were honest. You told him what he needs to hear even if he didn\u2019t want to.", "NTA. Because he asked. My parents had me in their forties too so I get what you are thinking.", "NTA.  He asked", "NTA.  You were initially circumspect and said nothing. When you did reply at his insistence, you gave fairly valid/logical reasons for your feelings, and it parallels your brother's plans enough that it is relevant.    \n\n\nI would ask him \"Hey, you gonna feel up to spending weekends playing catch in the backyard when you're 50?  Helping with homework when you're 55-60? How about being a soccer-dad when you're planning your retirement?\"", "NAH. Your brother and SIL have the right to have children, even though he is older, and you likewise have every right to share your perspective with him about it. I mean, it\u2019s not like you jumped down his throat about it. Your initial reaction was to keep it to yourself, as you only told him when he pressed you to find out what was wrong.\n\nI understand why you are looking at your brother and seeing your parents in him; seeing yourself in their future child. There are too many parallels for you to not notice and make the connection. Furthermore anyone considering parenthood should be willing to take steps to better their health if they\u2019d like to be a parent. Your concerns are valid. All that said, your brother is not your father. There may be a heightened chance that he is prone to the same genetic predispositions, and that he will succumb to them as your father did. That isn\u2019t a guarantee though. There are any number of genetic and environmental variables that can change that outcome.\n\nAs it stands now, you\u2019ve rendered an opinion and given him something to think about. It\u2019s understandable that he is upset. Hard truths- or at least daunting possibilities- are usually difficult to process. He\u2019s not an asshole for reacting negatively, and your in-laws aren\u2019t either. At this point, you\u2019ve said your piece, and now it\u2019s up to him to decide what is best for him.", "NTA but not sure what you had to say was very relevant. Lots of people have kids in their 40s. Even if you think his health is similar to your parents, don't you think he and his partner have a better idea of his health and capability than you?", "NAH\n\nYou feel the way that you do because your mother died when you were so close to her at the time. Your brother doesn\u2019t feel that same impact because he\u2019d been well out of the nest by that point. Nobody got mad, yelled, did any name calling etc. you all acted like adults. I will say that \u201cgetting over\u201d your mothers death made me rethink this take but I think they were just trying to comfort you.", "What on earth did you hope to gain by saying this? Do you just not want your brother to have a family because your parents are deceased? We\u2019re you informing him because he didn\u2019t know why your parents died? Like you were trying to alert him with information he didn\u2019t have? To change his mind?", "NAH, but you should apologize. I get wherw you are coming from but theres not really any reason to assume he will get sick and die young. He's in similar health but hes not sick and if his wife is healthy than the chances are lower. It was rude to imply he was going to mess up his kids and die young, but i under you are worried about someone going through something like that. Your resentment for your parents is clouding your judgment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA.", "Again, as I stated in my post, it's not about age. It's about health. \n\nAnd no, but if he's going to ask, I think I have a right to share what I endured. Both our parents were morbidly obese, heavy drinkers, neglected their health and had so many issues I was toileting, bathing and feeding mom at 10. You can image why I worry when I see both my brother and SIL exactly like this and discussing a child.", "Well, first he asked.\n\nSecondly, I mentioned this to him because he was not involved in our parents' lives or their cares in their later years. He was given a very different childhood so I don't think he ever realized how much we all struggled due to their health issues. He was a couple states away.\n\nThirdly and honestly, I don't think any child should have to be wiping their parent's bum at 9 because the parented decided to drink and neglect themself. Do I know if this would happen to his potential child? No. At the same time, his health is no different from theirs and I think it's unfair to bring a child into the world when doctor's don't think you'll be alive in the next 10 years.", "You may not be aware of this but people who have kids past 35 are constantly reminded of their mortality by other people. People love to say when \u201cyou\u2019re this age, your child will be this age. If you die at this age, your child will have lost a parent at this age\u201d. People make those comments whether the person is healthy or not. Your brother might have felt you were just another person making this comments. \n\nIt would have been better if you have just told your brother you\u2019re concerned that he\u2019s trying to have a child when his health isn\u2019t good. You could have just made a general comment that you (as in both of you) lost your parents way too soon and he should try to make some improvements so his kids won\u2019t have to go through that. Since this is a sore subject for a person in his situation, it might have been better to not mention age at all.", "But is your brother\u2019s (and his wife\u2019s) health currently the same as your parents\u2019 when they had you? Or is his age just triggering your own personal trauma??", "It's also a sore subject for OP though seemingly. They had vastly different childhood experiences and from the info provided and the comments it does sound like their brothers kids may end up having similar experiences to OP so I don't blame them for pointing out that possibility to their brother when pressed (OP didn't push this on their brother, he asked)", "To be honest, it would have just been better if he hadn't asked!", "From what he's told me, and what I see, they're pretty similar. He usually says, 'yeah I drink as much as dad, smoke as much as mom'. He also tells me how much the doctor warns them on their weight (both morbidly obese, as were our parents) and potential problems if they don't change. But, like our parents, they never follow the advice given (something he has also openly admitted to me).", "You know what, then I change my opinion to NTA - in the OP it sounds too much like unresolved trauma but it really looks like history could repeat itself (and I\u2019m very sorry for what you\u2019ve been through!). I suggest adding more info to your post so people could understand better! \n\nNo children should be born to parents that care this little about their own health, even for their own children."]}
