It sucks when people show their colors like this.", "NTA. Of course you're hurt.\n\nDeath is hard for **everyone**, ffs. She may not like funerals and rituals, and I guess that's fine, but it's not reasonable that you can't talk about someone because he's now dead. She probably needs therapy, but in the meantime she really should be a decent human being (even if she wants to avoid something specific like a funeral or talking about the process of death); supporting you when you're missing someone is basic human decency.\n\nShe's not being a decent friend, and it's reasonable that this affects your relationship.", "Death is hard for HER?

You've suffered the loss that was the love of your life, nothing can compare to that. And even if she was close to her uncle, I'm sorry but that doesn't give you a hall pass to be selfish. She is a bad friend, to say the least. She should have just sucked it up and been there for you. If nothing else, you could've talked about grief together. \n\nGood on you for saying something, that takes courage. This is going to be a hard slog for you, you'll need every support you can get.

Just because you're uncomfortable with death doesn't mean you get to pretend a friend isn't actively going through trauma. I don't understand why being uncomfortable with death would stop someone from even baseline comforting a friend who is hurting. You're an alive person in pain. The worst part is she's talking to you like she expects you not to act like you're grieving. Somehow her discomfort overrides your grief of losing a husband? That's absurd. It sounds like she thinks she came up with an excuse where she thinks she can get out of the difficult parts of relationships and that sucks.", "NTA. This comment might get buried (no pun intended) but my father and sister were killed suddenly in a vehicular homicide. A lot of people close to me were also in complete shock and grief. People didn\u2019t always say the right thing. In fact, they often said the wrong thing. But, you remember who was there for you, in whatever way they could show up, and who wasn\u2019t. Death is hard for everyone. It doesn\u2019t absolve you of being there for a friend. When you are dealing with a profound loss, like the sudden death of your husband, you expect your friend to be there, even if they don\u2019t know what to do and even if it\u2019s very hard for them. Feel free to cut anyone out that can\u2019t do that. My personal advice is to find support through groups of people who have a similar loss. I met some of the closest people to me in grief groups. You have enough on your plate right now. The last thing you have to worry about is if your loss was too much for someone else, and that made you a bad friend.", "NTA.

Unfortunately it sounds as though you\u2019ve lost a friend as well.", "NTA", "painful", "YTA. \n\nFirst of all, my deepest condolences for your loss. That being said, Rachel is not able to give you what you need. She cannot talk about death; she told you before. Stop violating her boundaries for your comfort. Right now, the death is raw, and you are looking for someone to blame. Go see a grief counselor instead of harassing your friend.", "NTA but she had already told you she struggles with death. Your mistake was thinking she had an obligation to be supportive after your husband's death because you'd been supportive of her after her uncle's death. That's not how it works.\n\nA lot of people struggle with death and have trouble dealing with their loved one's deaths so dealing with anyone else's death isn't happening. When my sister was dying of cancer, my friend cut me off mid-conversation, telling me she wasn't the person to talk to about this. That hurt.\n\nWe're still friends but on a more superficial level.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss. Keeping yourself together is tough after losing your spouse. I've been there.\nNow for your friend, she is an AH, and she's being selfish. At the very least she should have called. I get funerals are hard but to not be there to support a friend isn't cool.", "NTA -\n\nI am incredibly sorry for your loss.  You reacted out of pain and hurt, and while you weren't wrong in how you feel especially after being there for Rachel when she needed you. \n\nRachel telling you that she \"doesn't deal well with death\" I feel is kind of a cop out as NO ONE like's 'dealing' with death & loss.  While Rachel may not have been comfortable going to the services there are many other ways she could have been supporting you during this time. Instead she chose to ignore the subject, act like it didn't happen and ghost you. \n\nBut everyone deals with death and grief differently - and Rachel is not comfortable or strong in dealing with it.    If you value your relationship with her then tell her that you are sorry for what you said, but that you are hurt by her actions and felt abandoned.  However if you continue your friendship you should know that she is not someone you should count on in an emergency or highly stressful situation.  \n\nTake care.", "NTA frankly her behavior is inexplicable. But it certainly shows she is not yr friend, at all.", "Husband>uncle.  99.9% of the time", "Exactly,  that's what I said\nThat we don't have enough information to say whether she has this condition or not. \nSo we cannot outright say that Rachel is selfish and not a friend and so on\nSo I'm going with NAH"]}
