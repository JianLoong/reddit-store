We\u2019ve been through each other through a lot. She\u2019s the godmother of my daughter, who\u2019s 2 years old. We were the MOHs in each other\u2019s weddings. We hang out multiple times a week.\n\n6 months ago, Rachel\u2019s uncle passed away. They were very close. My husband and I supported Rachel through the entire thing. A few weeks after her uncle\u2019s death, Rachel said she couldn\u2019t manage talking about death, going to funerals, etc. I admit, I didn\u2019t completely understand but I didn\u2019t say anything outside \u201cI respect your feelings on this\u201d.

I felt like I lived in a fog for weeks, trying to keep everything together. I had a great support system. Another friend created a phone tree, Rachel was the first one she called. Halfway through the day after, I realized I needed my best friend and tried reaching out. She didn\u2019t answer. I went about my day but it definitely stuck out in my mind. She did eventually text me saying \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss\u201d. That was about it.\n\nIt took me a long time to process everything. I was on autopilot through the wake and funeral. At one point during the reception after the funeral, I asked someone where Rachel was. I kept getting vague answers until someone finally said \u201cShe didn\u2019t come\u201d. It cut deep. I ended up breaking down a few hours later and it was a mix of grief for my husband, sadness for my daughter who had lost her father and a feeling of abandonment.\n\nRachel and I would talk in the weeks after, but she never asked how I was doing. If I brought up my husband, she\u2019d give a one word answer and change the subject. At one point, she called when I was having a bad night. She asked what was wrong and I told her. She got quiet and said \u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d I snapped and asked why she was being this way? I said my husband was dead and she had barely been there. She said I knew that \u201cdeath was hard for her\u201d and I shouldn\u2019t expect more. I called her selfish and said that not only myself but my husband was there for her. She called me heartless.\n\nMost people are on my side.

That means, it's not about others. Death isn't easy for anyone. No one enjoys going to a wake or a funeral. But it's what we do for people we care about. \n\nI could somewhat understand maybe not being the person to help you through it but to say so little and not at least go to the wake? Damn.", "NTA. She was your bestfriend for 15 years. Understanding that death and funerals are hard for her, she could have atleast been there for you. Helped you out with things that needed help. Like planning the funeral or the wake and could have politely said she couldn't come to either because of her feelings on the topic.\nYou lost the love of your life and the father of your child.  Thats so hard to go through.", "Firstly, I\u2019m sincerely sorry for your and your daughter\u2019s loss. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but friendships go both ways. You and your husband were there for her, as you should\u2019ve been. She has not been there for you: yes, she\u2019s suffered a loss herself, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s dealing with it in her own way, but to skip the funeral and then cut you off when you need to talk, is poor form. And the lack of interest in how you\u2019re doing, is inconsiderate. You deserve better. \n\nMy sympathies again.", "NTA\n\nI hate to pile more onto your plate at such a time, but I would highly recommend making it legally official that if anything were to happen to you, your daughter not go to Rachel. (Since she's the Godmother.)\n\nFor whatever reason, she's incapable of dealing with death. This is not someone who will be there for your little one.\n\nSorry for your loss again. It sucks when people show their colors like this.", "NTA. Of course you're hurt.\n\nDeath is hard for **everyone**, ffs. She may not like funerals and rituals, and I guess that's fine, but it's not reasonable that you can't talk about someone because he's now dead. She probably needs therapy, but in the meantime she really should be a decent human being (even if she wants to avoid something specific like a funeral or talking about the process of death); supporting you when you're missing someone is basic human decency.\n\nShe's not being a decent friend, and it's reasonable that this affects your relationship.", "Death is hard for HER? Oh she is the one person who doesn\u2019t breeze through death./s death is hard for everyone. That was a cop out statement. NTA", "Wow, definitely NTA. You've suffered the loss that was the love of your life, nothing can compare to that. And even if she was close to her uncle, I'm sorry but that doesn't give you a hall pass to be selfish. She is a bad friend, to say the least. She should have just sucked it up and been there for you. If nothing else, you could've talked about grief together. \n\nGood on you for saying something, that takes courage. This is going to be a hard slog for you, you'll need every support you can get. Maybe having her around isn't helpful, so just keep it civil and find others who can be there for you, bc you deserve that and need it.\n\nI'm so so sorry you've had to go through this, it's so heartbreaking to hear.", "NTA, Rachel isn't actually your friend. I'm sorry for both the loss of your husband and the loss of someone you thought was a friend.", "NAH. I cannot imagine the grief you are going through but remember that \"Rachel said she couldn\u2019t manage talking about death, going to funerals, etc.\" may be the reason she didnt reach out", "NAH, while you supported Rachel and were right in expecting the same from her\nThere is literally a condition called Thanatophobia, people suffering from it cannot be around death, the dead or occasions involving death\n\nSadly, she cannot be blamed either", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m very sorry for your loss, I really am. But some things people are not comfortable with. Your friend made a line in the sand when she realized she could not talk about death anymore.

I still want to be there for you, maybe when you need a distraction or something fun to do\", as it does seem Rachel wants to maintain some contact, just not relating to the death.\n\nI wouldn't totally agree with this, but it's better than leaving OP to feel abandoned.

Please be serious.", "If you're a doctor, you should know about the risks and futility of blind diagnosis.\n\nYou know *nothing* about this person other than they said, in the immediate wake of their uncle's death, that they don't like or want to go to funerals. You know, like literally every person on this planet.", "True, there is a difference.  But when you see what someone wrote and from the writing itself you can see what might be going on, do you just ignore that?\nOr you say whether you think this is YTA/NTA/ESH/NAH based on what you see?\nAnd primary referrals are not medical settings,  they are phone calls", "Yes, but when someone gives a primary referral, you are doing so for a medical setting. Don't tell me you are a doctor who can't understand the nuance of that."]}
