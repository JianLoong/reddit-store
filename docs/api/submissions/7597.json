If you're not paying her travel expenses, you need to not ask him to pay for anything. It also means your share of household expenses should be higher, since you will need to be covering 3.5 people (yourself, your 2 kids, and half of joint child) while he pays for 1.5 people (2.5 for the 6 weeks his daughter is there).  Everything else -  activities, camps, transportation, hobbies, allowances, etc - comes from your individual account. Since you said the joint account is for household expenses, I'm guessing you consider your kids' expenses as part of that.  Does covering her transportation out of joint funds sound more fair now? YTA for counting his child differently.", "YTA. He pays his child support (ie, day to day expenses) separately from his own finances but you pay your  children's day to day expenses from joint finances. For two children i doubt the half be contributes amounts to less than $3k so the current set up seems fair.

Do they come out of the joint account or the individual account?\n\nThe reason I ask is because this kind of defines how you split up these costs - if you're taking joint money to pay for the eldest's education, it's fair to take joint money to pay for transportation of the step daughter.  On the other hand, if he leaves costs for the eldest to you with your individual account, he's being a major hypocrite here.\n\nYou might want to question why you are paying these costs and not stepdaughter's mother - she's got the same interest in this as your husband does, so it should be fairly split (though  to be fair, it  may be spelled out that it's his expense in their child support agreement).", "YTA.

He wouldn\u2019t be wrong to counter that you need to start supporting your two children\u2019s day to day costs out of your own account so he can put more of his money towards the flights.

While the kids were there it was our money. \n\nI have a feeling that in a full year he contributes more than triple that measly $3k to raising your two children you brought into this relationship. \n\nDo you really want to do a full breakdown, of every he spends on your two kids that live with him full time vs the cost of transportation plus housing and feeding your husband's daughter (I don't want do say your stepdaughter, as to imply a mother/daughter relationship to OP would be an insult to the little girl)? Because I have a feeling if you want to play a game of going tit for tat you'll end up on the wrong side of things. You're very happy to split things with your children in your favor, but you're reluctant to return the favor. If you want to play the game of counting where every single penny is spent I assure you you will lose that battle.", "Info is your husband contributing to your kids expenses?\n\nEdit- yta. I bet he'd be able to cover the flight if he stopped supporting your two kids.", " I say NTA because this expense is probably something he worked out with his daughter's mother same as you with your kids college expenses so it should be up to him to be able to pay for her travel. But do need more info. Like can he easily pay for the expenses by himself? Also why can't you afford it anymore? Are your seperate expenses getting too high? You should really sit down with your husband and discuss.", "YTA - he supports your kids, but you can't support his daughter? I have a feeling he spends a heck of a lot more on the local kids.", "Hmmm... I'm going soft YTA. Especially with comments confirming day to day expenses are shared.  I get where you're coming from, but it's also not a great look either. Someone can be correct and still not be right, feel me?", "Then he needs to take his part of the funds out of the joint account that is used for the day to day of your kids. That all needs to be from your own individual account. Since you are looking at a child as a transactional item, then it's only fair that no costs associated with the raising of your kids come from you and you alone. \n\nYTA.", "Then use your husband\u2019s words back at him. \n\nIf your childrens\u2019 college expenses can come out of the joint account, so can the fights. What? He doesn\u2019t want that? **Does he HATE your children???**", "Then he needs to take his part of the funds out of the joint account that is used for the day to day of your kids. That all needs to be from your own individual account. Since you are looking at a child as a transactional item, then it's only fair that no costs associated with the raising of your kids come from you and you alone. \n\nYTA.", "Info:  Does your ex pay child support for your two eldest?  If yes does any of that money go into the joint funds to pay for their day to day costs?", "INFO: How is travel handled/paid for when your older two go to their dad\u2019s?", "Oh, then you're totally the AH here. He contributes toward your kids WAY MORE in a  year than $3K but you don't want to contribute toward the other direction. What a gross person you are.", "But the expense skew unfairly in her direction.  She has TWO children being supported by the household all year (and she gets child support from her children's father so she's not even having to pay all of her \"half\" from her personal funds.  On the other hand her husband's daughter (one child)  is with them about six weeks out of the year so six weeks of day to day expenses plus her travel expenses.  \n\n\nIf OP wants to revisit that for fairness then her husband should insist that she cover her daughter's day to day expenses from her separate funds and then he should pay all of his daughter's travel and the day to day expenses during the six weeks she stays with him.", "\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "?", "She\u2019s provided additional info. They\u2019re not sharing educational expenses for her college age children, and she\u2019s 100% responsible there. From my perspective, unless he\u2019s willing to share educational expenses, then he should be thankful he\u2019s just having to pay for his daughter\u2019s flight. Is OP expected to contribute to her further education?\n\nEither way, she can\u2019t afford it. Regardless of what he\u2019s doing, how many kids they have, who belongs to whom- she cannot continue to pay with money she doesn\u2019t have, and that doesn\u2019t make her an AH. We don\u2019t know the household expenses portion and how much he actually provides for her kids.", "She states that all of her two daughter's day to day expenses come from the joint household account in her followup replies.  It does say she is paying their college and that she gets child support from their father.", "\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "Yea and supporting children that aren't yours all year long is crazy expensive so I wouldn't blame him for cutting out his 24/7 365 days a year help.", "Her kids are not in college yet. So that is irrelevant to him supporting their day to day needs. If they live at home while attending school. He will still be supporting their day to day needs.\n\nIn their household. He has financial responsibility for 1.5 people and she has financial responsibility for 3.5 people. Husband is definitely getting the short end of the stick here.", " I didn't see any of her follow up replies. However, I don't see where that matters, because her getting child support for her kids is a completely different thing and has no bearing on her needing to pay something that's his responsibility, like traveling to and from a different state on an airplane with his daughter.", "We will have to agree to disagree.", "Not at all. You state that he needs to pay for his child's expenses so obviously she needs to do that as well.  Not being misleading at all.", "No they shouldn't. Two of the four resident children are not the OP husband if he is contributing 50/50. Then expected to fund travel costs seperately.\n\nThey have his dd 8-10 weeks out of the year. So much less residency time.\n\nIf the OP husband can't afford it, he should reduce his contribution to the joint account so the OP is funding her two children's day to day costs 100% year round and put that money to his daughters travel costs.\n\nThe OP can't have it every which way to suit her self and her children.\n\nWe have a blended family. All money is joint and everything comes out of those joint funds. So we pay for our respective and joint children out of the same pool of money. Thats health, education, holidays, clothes etc.\n\nThat isn't the set up the OP has. Which is fine, but if that isn't what she wants then she needs to fund her children expenses in the household rather than expect her husband to do it.", "\ud83d\ude44", "I was going to go through OPs comments and post and lay out the facts, then I realised its Reddit and I don't care enough to write an essay about it when you clearly took what you wanted from my comment and made it what you wanted it.", "I still disagree. I don't think she's wrong, and I don't think she's saying this to keep score. General living expenses should be shared for everyone in the household. Extra expenses that are solely your own responsibility, like she said child support payments, etc should be handled by the parent whose responsibility it is. These oddball flights are a unique situation and they're his responsibility. That's my opinion, and you don't have to agree with it.", "No I don't but I hope the OP husband takes this as an opportunity to consider their finances as a whole and comes to his senses and realises he isn't obligated to fund the OP s two children all year any more than she feels she has an obligation to fund these costs."]}
