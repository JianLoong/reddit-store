{"id": 4749, "submission_id": "zm32ch", "title": "AITA for telling my nephew about his bio father and the real story of how he was conceived ?", "selftext": "Nephew was born in 2008. He's the son of my (newly) ex-husband's sister. \n\nMy husband and I have just finalized our divorce. I'm moving away to a new country in a couple weeks, so IDGAF about the repercussions.\n\nOne thing that always bothered me with that family is the huge lie spin by my SIL around her son's father. \n\nShe claim she got pregnant from a fling with a pool boy at a Mexico resort. She has one picture of him, a shirtless picture of an early-twenties generic muscle model with light-skin and vague Latino features that she \"found\" a couple years ago while \"cleaning out her suitcase\". Since then she's been pushing pretty hard the whole \"Mexican fling\" thing, which coincided with the time my nephew started asking questions about his bio father. \n\nThe truth is my SIL paid a guy to conceive a child with her. The deal was that he'd be listed as the child father to get his citizenship then he'd pay her back. She was desperate for a child of her own but didn't want to wait as she was pushing forty.\n\nShe got pregnant a first time but miscarried a couple months in. She paid him a second time, this time he wanted double (20K), so she borrowed the money from my husband \"to fix her roof\". This time she carried to term. The bio father disappeared with the money. \n\nShe confessed everything to us in tears after realizing she was defrauded of 30K and stuck raising a child on her own. Somehow she hoped the guy would stick around and be a father to their son. Yes she's an incredibly naive woman. \n\nPolice got involved, there was an investigation but came up empty. All they had was a name (fake), address (fake) and phone number (fake). \n\nMy nephew is obviously very suspicious as he look very much like his Black bio father and nothing like the light skin male model of the picture. It's even hard to believe he has a Caucasian mother, as he takes very much from his father. \n\nAs my last contact with this family, I reached out to my nephew. I told him everything. I sent him the emails with the police as proof. He's a smart boy, he's kind and generous and funny and he deserve to know the truth about his origins. There's a picture in the files of his bio Dad, along with a couple of names he used that either us or the police linked to him. \n\nHe thanked me, said he wasn't surprised the male model wasn't his father. He wants to do a DNA test when he turns 18 to know more about his origins, maybe figure out which country or area of the world his bio father is from. Being raised a black boy in a almost exclusively white area had been very hard on him, lots of bullying and feeling like he doesn't belong. It got even worse when his Mom started pushing the whole \"Mexican boy\" on everyone. \n\nSince then my ex-SIL and ex-husband keep blowing my phone, leaving very angry voicemails about how I had no right to meddle in the family secrets.\n\n**Edit : see comment history for more context and details. Didn't know I could edit the post after it went live, I thought I had to respect the 3K limit. For now I'm going to bed, it's running late here.** \n\nSummary of details provided : the kid asked me many time over the years about his bio father. We have a very close relationship and I'm one of, if not the adult he trust most. It was a huge point of contention between him and his mother and led to many fights between them. The \"IDGAF\" repercussion thing was poorly worded and referred the repercussion I may face as an individual (i.e IDGAF my ex inlaws now hate me), not how the thing would play out for my nephew. I'm not worried about him, the adult are angry at me but not at him and I know for a fact they wont take it out on him. I did it without ill-intent, kind of ripping out the plaster as I go. The kid is fine, he's relieved to finally know the truth. I'm confident my ex-husband will be the one to turn around the quickest as he always wanted to tell him the truth too in face of his sister egregious lies (but was too afraid of repercussions, like I was, i.e getting estranged from his sister and mother thus losing access to our nephew).", "created_utc": 1671054026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm32ch/aita_for_telling_my_nephew_about_his_bio_father/", "score": 216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s 14, not 5. He\u2019s been thinking these questions about his parentage long before he voiced them I can almost guarantee. The pain he might suffer from the truth is less than the pain he\u2019s been suffering for the past 14 years from being lied to by everyone in his family. \n\nImagine navigating life being told your moms an apple, your dads an orange, and somehow you\u2019re a fucking eggplant.  And he\u2019s just supposed to accept it until his moms ready to fess up??", "EDIT: NTA after OP provided further information that the son approached her many times regarding his questions on his bio father and that OP has also tried to talk to the sons mother multiple times \n\nOriginal your the asshole comment - why did you take it upon yourself to tell him this extremely sensitive piece of information? If you really felt he deserved to know that\u2019s a conversation to have with his mother. You\u2019ve now robbed this boys mother the chance to tell him herself if she chose. \n\nThe boys father sounds like someone who would have never been involved in his life no matter who he believed it was so I don\u2019t understand why you would go behind the mothers back and do this?", "NTA I know I'm going against the grain but my dh went through a bio dad lie and could have been saved so much anguish (and therapy bills) if just one person had done the right thing. You've ultimately done a good thing, it's just a pity his family weren't the ones to do it. \n\n  However, I really hope your nephew does not believe this was a vengeful act. My dh was informed out of revenge rather than any regard for him and this was a contributing factor to his sense of betrayal. Even if he felt only you respected him, that would be a good buffer against the damage of not trusting those that are meant to be his foundations. I can read your discomfort and sympathy for him in your replies but make sure he knows that because he's now at a vulnerable point where his sense of self-worth could really plummet.", "NTA the kid is grateful to have the truth! He even suspected it, so what? If you wouldn't have done it, I think SIL would have taken the secret to the grave as she is so ashamed.. You saved the boy a lot of therapy in the long run :)", "NTA. The kid needs someone in his life who won\u2019t lie to him, and who cares about him. Nobody else seems to. You\u2019re the aunt he deserves and needs. Well done.", "NTA. You have a close relationship with him, and he\u2019s been asking. If I were him, I\u2019d want to know the truth.", "NTA. He deserved to know. Fuck parents who lie about this shit just to protect their own ego and self interest.", "NTA. Everyone saying Y-T-A seems to have misread your \"IDGAF about consequences\" comment. To me, it's pretty clear you don't care if your ex and his sister make a stink about you finally telling your nephew the truth, NOT that you don't care about him.\n\nPeople need to fucking read better.", "NTA, and people saying it\u2019s \u201cnot your place\u201d should be ashamed. Blatantly lying about a child\u2019s heritage in this manner isn\u2019t any old run of the mill parenting choice. It\u2019s \u201cnot your place\u201d when your nephew isn\u2019t allowed to watch MTV, it\u2019s something else entirely when you\u2019re asked to be an accomplice in a lie that is detrimental to the child\u2019s mental health and well-being. \n\nNews flash: not all parents are good parents, and not all parenting choices are good ones. All kids need an adult they can trust, but sadly those adults aren\u2019t always their parents. You can always \u201cmind your own business\u201d and turn a blind eye to people who need help. OR you can help, because that\u2019s what a good person does. \n\nThis kid has finally had his suspicions confirmed and can no longer be gaslighted on this topic.

This is probably a huge weight off his shoulders.", "NTA you righted a wrong on the way out, continue with your life journey and don't look back", "NTA", "Was it done out of pettiness?  Yes.\n\nBut was it wrong? No I don\u2019t think so. \n\nFrom the post and the comments I read get the impression that your nephew was both a smart boy and very mature for his age. You knew he was searching for the truth and how much it bothered him and what he went through as a result. \n\nIt was clear that Noone else were ever going to tell him the truth and he does have a right to know about his origin. \n\nSo NTA. Petty yes, asshole not entirely.", "ESH\n\nIdk why everyone is saying it was up to the SIL to discloses this when the times right. Based on OP\u2019s comments she was actively GASLIGHTING this kid into believing that he was half Mexican and not half Black?? I mean I get parents having the right to decide when to tell their children about specific parental identities, but forcing an entirely different race and ethnicity on him??? And then shaming him when he doesn\u2019t feel connected to it?? I mean can you imagine seeing yourself in the mirror and being told that you\u2019re an entirely different race than what you can feel to be right for 14 years? As a minority person, like that\u2019s insane. It is possible to tell and it can fuck you up to be told something like that for years. It\u2019s like telling an interracial child he\u2019s only white, it\u2019d never work and the child knows you\u2019re lying. Or it works somehow and causes them to deny a huge part of themselves that should be explored. \n\nThat being said, it seems like OP\u2019s only reason for doing this now is either revenge, spite, or \u201cI\u2019m leaving so fuck the consequences.\u201d There also seems to be a huge amount of judgement for the SIL for being scammed, which shouldn\u2019t play into the decision to tell the child what RACE he is?? Like honestly, if anything, OP should have told the child a long time ago, at least about his race. (There also seems to be some glee in the child\u2019s \u201csordid\u201d origin, when that shouldn\u2019t matter, and SIL only became an asshole when she came up with the Mexican cover story that seems honestly kinda racist.) But OP\u2019s reasoning rn is what makes them a huge asshole too. Like either tell the child for his own good, or don\u2019t do it because you\u2019re leaving and won\u2019t need to deal with the fall out.", "NTA. That\u2019s an utterly ridiculous lie and every person deserves to have full, truthful information about their parentage. I agree it \u201cwasn\u2019t your place\u201d but the person whose place it was is a lying liar, and 14 is well old enough to have some details.", "You know what NTA, I don\u2019t know what your genuine reasons were for telling him but that boy deserved to know, why wouldn\u2019t his mom just tell him that his dad was a random black model? Lol like that\u2019s so weird, did she really think he would never find out he wasn\u2019t Mexican?? I hope they get this poor kid some therapy", "NTA she wasn\u2019t really defrauded. She paid for a kid, she got a kid. He\u2019s old enough to know the truth and his mom sounds like a basket case. Could she not find a generic photo with a guy of the correct ethnicity? Or even show him a picture of his real dad and just tell him the same story about him, that it was a fling. I think as a kid I would actually prefer if she just told me she used a sperm donor. She chose to lie in the most traumatic way possible.", "Utter YTA.

You took revenge. I don't care what for. YTA", "NTA - if you hadn\u2019t told him you\u2019d be equally culpable as a party to the lie.

Like yes I'm aware there's some Black Mexican, but try explaining that to racist kids. \n\nWe watched the Olympics one year when he was young and each time a Mexican was on screen his Mom told him to cheer for his country. Like bitch no lil Dude is Canadian first, stop making him cheer for a country he has nothing to do with for your own vanity.When an African man was competing he'd point out to the guy all excited yelling \"me me me me me\". It was sad to see.", "He asked me many many times over the years. He told me he knew his mom was lying to him. I kept the secret which always made me feel bad because I was one of the very few adults he really trusted. \n\nWhen pushed, his Mom only dug her heel more in the Mexican story. It's like pushing the story she slept with a hot male model was more important than admitting to her son real parentage.", "We tried, both my husband and I, several time over the years. He's been very insistent about knowing about his father, and never believed his mother after she pulled out the model picture. \n\nHe asked me privately more times than I can count. He asked my husband. He asked his grandparents, he asked his cousins. My husband and I deferred to his mother. His grandfather deferred to his mother, his grandmother enthusiastically pushed on the Mexican lie for some reason. \n\nIt's not just a poor helpless child getting hit by the unexpected cold harsh truth. I told the truth to a teen who had been asking for it for years now. He wasn't surprised at all. He was just \"so that's what I thought\". He's relieved that he looks like a black guy because his father was a black guy. He's relieved to know that he doesn't feel any connection to Mexican culture, something his mother tried to guilt him for, because he has indeed no connection at all to Mexican culture.", "Nothing happened with my ex, we're just done being together.\n\nAs for the kid, he asked me more times I can count over the years if I knew anything about his real father. I never said anything, told him he had to have the talk with his mother as it wasn't my place.\n\nShe kept pushing the lie, he knew it was a lie. He told his mother many time he didn't believe her. When I told him it was just confirmation of what he knew all along.", "1) She wanted a baby. She was obsessed with having a little baby of her own because all her friends had settled down and had babies of their own an she didn't want to get old without having her little baby. She was also (her words) \"Completely over men\" after her last one of a long string of failed relationships. To be fair, she did attracted some spectacular losers. \n\nAs for the fraud, she claimed the guy told her he needed the money to settle his immigration status. If she paid him, he'd father her child which would help him getting his citizenship, then he'd pay her back once he could legally work in the country and support her and the child. \n\nWas it a guy taking advantage of a very naive and desperate woman ? Or did she just went out and offered money for a guy to fuck her. She never gave a straight answer about how she met him, nobody close to her ever saw the guy save for her roommate, she saw him one morning leaving my SIL bedroom. Sometime he was a coworker, or a friend of a coworker, sometime he was a stranger she met on a dating site, sometime he was the friend of a neighbor.\n\n2) I don't think she cared much about the race of the father as long as it was a guy willing to have unprotected sex with her. \n\nShe was never one to ponder the long term consequences of her actions.", "Honestly she should have never have a child. She was barely fit to take care of herself on her own. \n\nWhen she got pregnant the first time, her two parents (divorced for over 20 years) got together in the same room for the first time since their divorce to tell her they strongly believe she should terminate the pregnancy or give the kid for adoption. \n\nWhen she lost the first pregnancy, we were all sad but relieved.\n\nShe did it again so the family went in emergency mode to put a support system around her so the child would not suffer.", "Idgaf what anyone else says, you gave him info he'd been asking you for (per your other comments on here) and I fully understand why you did it. No one deserves to grow up with such a huge lie about who he is. It's affecting him tremendously and even tho everyone is screaming that you did it out of revenge, I believe you did it out of love for him. Sometimes the truth just has to come out in a bombshell, and it's not like he was completely ignorant, he knew shit didn't add up and turned to you as his closest (emotionally) relative. I understand why you waited to tell him now, and tbh, I don't blame you.\n\nFuck them for lying and digging their graves even deeper as time went on. All this shit is on his mother's head and everyone who was complicit with her.\n\nNTA. Kudos for being a real one.", "How old is the nephew?", "Did you try to talk to the mother first? Even simply letting her know you would tell him she chose not to? Was she blindsided by your choice to tell him and not have time to prepare herself to handle the fallout? \n\nYour ex-SIL is absolutely the asshole as well, but that doesn\u2019t really give you a pass. It does change things that the boy has been asking you, and makes you less of an AH. If you talked to the mother beforehand I wouldn\u2019t consider you an AH\n\nETA I think it\u2019s pretty abhorrent that your ex SIL is trying to make her son adopt a culture he is not a part of", "That's good. It's no harm him thinking you got in trouble for it, it shows that he was worth the trouble. I think you should keep in contact, though I know most people will see it differently. At least until you know he has others he can confide in and new 'foundations' of sorts built. \n\n  At least he was always suspicious, that probably helps a little with his identity. Poor kid. And telling him he was Mexican, what possessed them? Was that some response to racist bullying, like she thought if she spread the lie that he was Mexican he wouldn't get flack for being a black kid? It seems unhinged. Your poor nephew.", "IDK the mom was the kind of woman getting blackout drunk telling everyone and their dog that \"once you go black you never go back\". Before the guy disappeared she was bragging about riding a black stallion and how black guys were so much better than all the deadbeat white trash guys she dated before.", "I mean, you didn\u2019t tell him the truth until you personally didn\u2019t have to deal with the consequences\u2026.", "If he knew his mother was lying, you let it be, and you let the boys take the DNA test with what you said you did it out of spite, which makes you wrong. Like I said, you could\u2019ve told him take a DNA test. Ask your mother again you didn\u2019t have to tell him the full story you\u2019re an Ahole", "Still the AH. You're the adult, he's not. You continue with \"ask your mother,\" until he's a legal adult. Major YTA.", "Not your place and you knew it then. That didn\u2019t change with the divorce. You fucked with a 14 year olds relationship with their only parent because you\u2019re salty about the divorce. You\u2019re a big AH", "Well if you honestly believe she was never going to tell him, that might change things a little", "Sorry but is the mother black? If the father was and the mother is not how is she trying to pass of a Mexican as the father.\n\nWho is listed on the birth certificate?", "1)Hmm. Seems like it would've made more sense to have a green card marriage if she wanted him to stick around to raise the baby a bit. \nAs the men say \"you don't pay a hooked for sex, you pay her to leave afterward \"\n\n2) Hmm. As a black woman, I really wish white people having mixed kids would think about these things. I'm not against interracial adoption but interracial insemination seems weird when there's no connection to that culture. It's not about gatekeeping mixed kids, but about not choosing to give your kids a disadvantage by raising them in a homogeneous environment when they're not the majority. These are things I think about as well whether my kids will be mixed or black.", "I'm so sorry to hear this! I just meant that the son at least should know he was wanted.", "I\u2019ll disagree slightly.   Cause she has had years to do this if she thought it was the right thing to do.  She is now doing it so she can throw one last bomb into exs family.   She isn\u2019t staying to support the boy.  Rather the boy is collateral damage\nNot necessarily wrong for telling him. But her attitude isn\u2019t one that wanted to help the kid but rather hurt the ex", "14, turning 15 in a couple weeks.", "Born in 2008, so 14.", "Yes, my husband and I tried different approach over the year as we could see how if was affecting her son. \n\nShe didn't want to hear anything. When she heard our arguments her first reaction was \"what, you're jealous I slept with a hot guy?\" It's the only thing that mattered since she produced that picture. Every time the question was raised, it didn't boiled down to the boy's lineage, it boiled down to her presumably having sex with a legit male model. When someone questioned who the boy father was, she only took offense about how we didn't believe she could have sex with a hot guy.", "The Mexican is grounded on the fact my SIL had gone on a trip to a Mexico resort around the time she got pregnant. What she told us is she got the idea after a friend of hers joked that she must have become pregnant from all the hot Mexican boys she probably seduced down there. \n\nTo us (husband and I) she never denied the father was the man she paid but she didn't want other people to know the real reason why the father was absent. FIL knows because he's not blind and confronted his daughter. MIL I think she doesn't know, and refuse to see what's right in front of you (they're divorced, just for context) SIL told us out of desperation and fear, because she had to fess up the truth as to where that 20K had gone seeing her roof had not been repaired and she was still out 10K of her own pockets. It was a huge amount for her. Husband never saw that money again, and we ended up paying ourselves to have her roof fixed. \n\nThen two years ago she pulled out the picture and I really think she started to believe her own lie.", "I mean you can keep justifying but you will be still YTA, because you did it out of spite and that's clearly stated when you say \"IDGAF about the consequences\". Yes, I'm not gonna deny that you might have made your nephew a favor by doing this, but you did it through an AH move. The motivation is what makes you the AH, not the act itself.", "Was more afraid of the consequences for my then-husband. If I spoke before, he'd be the one stuck between his wife and his mother+sister. \n\nMy husband wanted to tell him too. But he was afraid of estranging his mother and sister. He hated the lie his sister was spinning. He tried to convince her many time to come clean. At the same time we both were his sister and mother main support, and by extension our nephew's. SIL worked intermittently according to her whim. MIL is on disability. Without us they'd have been in a very hard situation, but again not sure if pride would take over so we were afraid they'd cut us off our nephew. \n\nNow that hurdle doesn't exist. He doesn't have to pick a side. He can be angry at me, whatever, we're not a thing anymore. SIL and MIL can hate me all they went, it's no skin off my nose anymore. They can have a united front against me, good for them. Ex-husband remains in the portrait to provide for the family, no fear that nephew will suffer. Despite their faults I know for a fact none of them will take it on the kid. I'm the big baddy here and now the cat is out the bag. \n\nI just hope the adults around him will regain their senses and move on accordingly. I do trust my ex-husband will get around it quickly.", "Mother is white, father is black. \n\nAFAIK on the birth certificate she gave the name of the guy. Thought the police investigation turned out nothing about a guy this name who could be the father. Police believed he gave her a false name. The only lead the investigation had was the phone number he gave her belonged to a guy who told police he had a roommate that stayed with him for a couple months who fit the description, but he knew the guy under another name that wasn't the one my SIL knew. He said the guy left town one day, told him he was going to another city for a job, He only knew him before as an acquaintance of friend looking for a place to live. The friend in question claimed he had no idea of the whereabouts of his acquaintance, they only knew each other from work but even this guy gave a different name for him. They couldn't find immigration record or employment record under any of those names tho if you're illegally in the country in the first place that's not far fetched. \n\nOnly on LinkedIn last time we checked there was over a hundred guys with this name, it's as generic as can be. If you add + [country name] the guy claimed he was from, you get +5M results on Google. \n\nI don't know if it was changed to \"unknown father\" or what. \n\nSo yes that's the really ridiculous part of the whole story. Claim the father is Mexican, fine, there are Black Mexicans afterall. It's only when she pulled out that picture of a light-skinned Latino guy and claimed this guy was the father that it get unbelievable. The child is very dark skinned and has prominent African features, it's a reach to believe he's the result of a white woman and light-skin Latino.", "I would add to your main post that the son had asked you multiple times and that you have tried talking to the sons mother multiple times. The way it\u2019s written makes it sound like you made an impulsive decision out of nowhere with potentially serious consequences\n\nAdding this information changes my stance to NTA", "She could have saved all of you this trouble, but especially her son if she just said she used a sperm donor. Which is basically what happened.\n\nNTA. You did right by your nephew who,has been the most affected by this", "Character limits made it so I had to keep light on details. Looking back there are information I should have included and other that are not as relevant that I thought they were.", "You can edit to add it afterward\n\n  \n\n\nIt changed the tone from vindictive yo I longer have repercussions I care about to finally tell this boy the truth after years of asking", "NTA You had no duty to protect her lies.", "YTA. What a disgusting thing to do. Truly. You\u2019re part of the reason everyone complains about Milennials.", "And you just felt this burning need. This hellacious desire. This unquenchable thirst for truth. You don\u2019t really care about this child. Or you wouldn\u2019t of done it the way you did. You just wanted to stir up drama because of your whole IDGAF attitude. And hey. If that\u2019s your attitude that\u2019s cool. But what is this really your business? I\u2019m still trying to decide", "YTA - not necessarily for dropping the bomb, but for dropping the bomb and not caring about the repercussions. It sounds like you did it to teach her a lesson/pettiness/etc.", "NTA Sounds like you didn\u2019t tell him out of spike towards you ex, but because you care about this young men and he really needed to learn the truth.", "YTA This wasn\u2019t your story to tell. You interfered in something that no longer concerns you. Didn\u2019t do this with I\u2019ll intent? BS. You did this on purpose, to make your ex family implode, so you could sit back and watch the fall out. You\u2019re a real piece of work. Not surprised your marriage fell apart if this is just a hint of the type of person you are.", "You think the boys mother was going to tell him the truth? He knew she was lying.", ">Even before her clarification I understood her to mean she didn't GAF about how they(SIL/EX-hub) felt/acted toward her.   \n>  \n>She was trying to help her nephew.", "With stolen money. She could have gone to a sperm bank for 1/30 of that cost.", "How is the fact that his father is Black and he\u2019s not Mexican \u201cconfidential information\u201d?", "There was nothing in the original post to indicate the mother would lie if directly confronted or that the son knew she was intentionally lying to him", "You did the right thing. It\u2019s not easy for a boy to be raised without a father. It\u2019s probably worse if your mother refuses to acknowledge that you are clearly black, that your father was clearly black, and  when you probably don\u2019t have many black peers in your school or the community. It\u2019s probably very lonely. Thank you for giving him the dignity of an honest answer.\n\nThere\u2019s a part of me that wishes you could get a vial of spit from him so you could do the 23 and me on his behalf so he doesn\u2019t have to wait until he\u2019s legally an adult to get some answers, but I understand why that might be problematic.", "All I meant was that at least the kid knows he was wanted. Trying to see some light at the end of a dark, convoluted tunnel.", "If you go thru her comments she explains exactly why she did it at this point. Not everyone is a petty or vengeful bitch. A LOT of people are projecting here. And even if she did it to be petty at this point? So the fuck what.. the boy deserved the truth, had been BEGGING for the truth for years. AND her ex agreed that the boy needed to know, he was just too chicken to say anything for his own selfish reasons. \n\nEven if I hadn't read a single one of her comments (and at the time I posted this,  I'd only seen one), this still would have been my answer. I honestly don't give a fuck who's life implodes when truth is revealed. People shouldn't be shady or straight up lying sacks of shit... Too many ppl innocent people get hurt, like her nephew. It's better the truth comes out and people can heal from there on out. Or not, it's up to them to take their heads out of their asses and get their lives together. OP has a clean conscience and her nephew is thankful. It is HIS life in question here, not his mother's or any other people who were complicit with her outrageous lies she kept spinning to feed her ego. He deserves the truth. Period.", "And why didn't she just use a sperm donor?  This is what sperm banks are for.", "Certainly would have been cheaper.", "She didn't use a sperm donor because she didn't want to be a single mother. She wanted a partner, not just a baby. It says in the post she was hoping the dad would stick around to help her raise the baby. She tried to baby-trap the biological father and got conned."]}
