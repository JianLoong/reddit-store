I, in my mind, was thinking that the invitation was for me AND for my boyfriend since the whole family have known about him for a while and they have met him on multiple occasions.\n\nToday, I decided to ask my cousin about the plans of the wedding day to be up to date with everything and mentioned my boyfriend, that\u2019s when he told me that the invitation was for me and me only, that they decided to invite family and close friends only and that it\u2019s too late now because they\u2019ve already planned the exact amount of food with the caterer, I said that I assumed that the invitation was for the both of us and that it doesn\u2019t make sense to invite me and not my partner, the wedding is in MONTHS and they could still arrange with the catering company for one more plate. He said that they already paid and it wasn\u2019t possible to add more people, that\u2019s when I told him that I will not be attending the wedding because in my opinion it\u2019s insulting to not include my partner who has been sharing my life for over a year.\n\nHe didn\u2019t reply but I received a call from my other cousin telling I\u2019m TA for THREATENING to not come to the wedding, I told her I didn\u2019t threaten not to come I am genuinely not coming, she said it\u2019s ridiculous to expect my boyfriend to be invited and that I should just suck it up and be there for my family.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for refusing to go to the wedding because my boyfriend is not invited or should I just stfu and go alone ?\n\nPS: I have to mention that my parents and siblings live in a totally different country, so I am living alone here that\u2019s why, for me, it\u2019s important to have my boyfriend with me during these occasions since I can\u2019t have any other close member of my family, he kind of became my only close family here.", "created_utc": 1704401768, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ynoz7/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_cousins_wedding/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s supposed to be optional, it\u2019s not a demand.\n\nAlso are you expected to pay the travel to the other country yourself? Take time off work etc? If it was me, if my partner was not considered close enough to be included I wouldn\u2019t consider it important enough to prioritize going. I\u2019d wish them the best and that would be all.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It is odd that other people got plus ones, but not you. I just would not go. It is an invite, not a summons. Stuff them.", "I'm going with NAH\n\nYour cousin has the complete right to specify who he invites to  his wedding. They're expensive & him & his fiancee  decided on family & close friends.\n\nIt's also okay for you to thank him politely for his invite (in the hope that will ameliorate the drama ) & confirm you won't be able to attend.", "YTA\n\n1 - Weddings are expensive.  \n\n2 - You just said you don't like his fiance that much, do you think maybe he picks up on that?

When figuring out who you 'have' to invite, if they are 'boyfriends', it's one thing compared to 'significant others' who are either living with or engaged to the person.  AGain see point #1.\n\nAnd really you've already said you aren't going so....what makes you think they'll turn around and say 'sure' now?", "NTA.

It also seems going on what OP has said all other members had their partners (engaged married or not) invited so it seems to be signalling OP out.

If things are that serious and your family knows that then there\u2019s no reason he shouldn\u2019t be invited. Something tells me there\u2019s more to this story though I can\u2019t see your cousin being so adamant about him not coming over the $10 for a plate of food.  If that\u2019s truly the case then Call his bluff and tell him y\u2019all will pay for the additional cost to have him included.", "NTA, you're not obligated to go. They should've invited you both.

Too bad for them.", "NTA that would be the other cousin who called to complain. \n\nAn invitation is not a summons. Cousin wants to keep it small so you are doing them a favor in removing yourself.  Now they have wiggle room if someone else wants to bring a +1. \n\nPerhaps 40 years ago it was only married people who got a +1, but in todays society where so many folks never plan on marrying that is pretty exclusionary.

You should consider yourself lucky you got an invite *at all*.\n\n>  I assumed that the invitation was for the both of us and that it doesn\u2019t make sense to invite me and not my partner\n\nHow utterly entitled. Why in the world would it need to make sense to *you*?\n\nYou're right that you shouldn't go to this wedding. But the narrow framework of your question notwithstanding, you're still the asshole here.", "NTA\n\nEveryone else gets to bring their partner, including not married ones, and there is plenty of time to add a plate. The can't add a plate story is absolutely a lie as well as singling you and your partner out", "NTA. The others get their +1 and not you ? It\u2019s about your boyfriend, they don\u2019t want him. Try to know why", "NTA.  No one is obligated to give plus one's to people they invite to a wedding.  Conversely, no one is obligated to go to any wedding.  OP, you did interpret the invitation wrong.  They did not put \"and guest\" on your invitation.  You assumed and that is YOUR bad.  However, a mistake doesn't make you an asshole. \n\nGiven everything that you have laid out in your post and in comments, I do think your cousin is on the AH side of things.  Not by a mile, but firmly.", "NTA it is rude to invite you on your own.", "NTA. A year plus is more than long enough for a SO to be accepted as serious. You're also giving plenty of notice that you're declining the invite.", "NTA because other family members and their partners got the same invitation with the same wording.\n\nIf they dont want you there, it is what it is.", "YTA. \n\nUnless your bf's name is on the invite or if you are allowed a plus 1, you should never \"assume.\" It's completely your choice to not go to the wedding, but it's also the bride and groom's choice to decide their guest list.", "NTA. If you have to travel to this wedding (and if that's why the invites are going out months ahead), why wouldn't you get a plus one for someone you've grown close to (and may well be engaged to by the time the wedding occurs). And if it becomes the case that you split up by that time, then it's one less person at the wedding. \n\nIt does seem strange that if the wedding is more than four months (or whatever) away from now, that a final payment on catering was due. If anything, a deposit, I can believe. But anything less than two months, why would a bridal couple know how many can actually attend an event that many will have to travel to. \n\nAnd it sounds from the last paragraph (the PS) that the OP isn't expecting her parents or siblings to make this wedding. So why would the OP be obligated to go (if it's some cultural \"the family is expected to attend\" event)? Is that other cousin (the one who threatened her) getting a plus one?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Plus ones can add a TON of extra expense to weddings and it's up to the bride and groom to decide where the cut-off is. For many modern couples, the cut off is \"living together\". If you're not living together, engaged, or married, you're not invited with a plus one. This is normal and not problematic. \n\nYou made an incorrect assumption based on your own feelings that was an unreasonable assumption to make.\n\nThe reason it's a soft YTA is because often exceptions to plus ones are made if the guest in person is traveling for the wedding. It would have been generous of them (but not required) to give you a plus one to accompany you since you're not local. \n\nYou made an unreasonable assumption, attempted to impose on the bride and groom, and threw a tantrum when they declined to accommodate your imposition. \"No\" is a complete sentence.

Could it be that she doesn't like the fiance because she once stole a nuclear warhead and wanted to hold the east cost hostage?   \n\n\nWe don't have any more details than what OP has stated here, and there's no point in projection hypothetical situations onto it.    \n\n\nShe was invited, her partner was not, she's declining the invitation. Simple as that.  There are no assholes here.", "Who cares if they're engaged? They've been together for over a year and are in a serious, committed relationship. I've known couples who have been together for years and never got married. Alternately, I've known couples who knew each other for a handful of months before getting married. Is one relationship more significant than another because rings were exchanged?", "They are seriously dating & talking about getting married and living together. \n\nAre you also aware that not everyone gets married? At what point does a relationship become significant to you? I know people who\u2019ve been together 20+ years, but will likely never get married. How are they not significant? An SO is a term used to describe a relationship of significance when one is not married.", ">Significant other? They\u2019re not even engaged\n\nThat's the entire concept of the term 'significant other'...\n\nOtherwise people would just say their spouse.  It encompasses all serious relationships.  People have met and been married in less time.", "Of course.\n\nWhat would it chance for me, if they were dating for a month or for 10 years?\n\nAnd if i dont want to attend to a wedding were my SO is not welcome am I an asshole?", "Maybe your reality.", "It says in the post that they have met him multiple times", "from what I read, the couple doesnt seem to care, at least not the bride (they gave no response).\n\nthe only person who gave her shit about it was a different female cousin. thats extended family drama that has nothing to do with the bride", "I don\u2019t think they care. Probably, they\u2019re just calling her out for her attitude towards her cousin.", "Ffs, idk how many times I have to say this. To an outsider of their relationship, like the cousin:\n1. They\u2019ve only been together a year\n2. They aren\u2019t married or engaged\n3. They don\u2019t even live together \n4. They don\u2019t have kids \n\nThey may be very serious about each other, but to someone deciding who to invite to their wedding, it does not seem like a \u201cserious\u201d relationship.", "If they aren't living together it not a committed serious relationship. It's just a relationship.\n\nOnce you are living with someone, you get to know the real person behind the dating facade. Are they a slob, do they pay their bills, etc...", "At the 18 month mark you were married or engaged, they are not. It\u2019s not even about the timeframe, it\u2019s the fact that to the cousin, her boyfriend is just someone she\u2019s been dating for a year and doesn\u2019t live with, isn\u2019t engaged or married to. Like it doesn\u2019t seem very serious from an external perspective so I get why they wouldn\u2019t invite him. If I went to weddings with every person I\u2019d been dating for a year, there would be lots of awkward family photos \ud83d\ude05", "Yeah so good for you.\n\nQuestion? How is this relevant??\nAnswer=. It's not\n\nIt's not what your relationship became. It is the perception of what it looks like to others.", "My parents got married after 3 months of knowing each other. That was 45 years ago and they\u2019re still married. \n\nEDIT: Lol at getting downvoted for sharing how long my parents have been married. Ah, Reddit.", "It\u2019s not about the months, it\u2019s the fact that to her cousin, all he knows is they\u2019ve been dating for a year, aren\u2019t married or engaged and don\u2019t have kids. Like that doesn\u2019t sound serious at all", "No ring, no bring. It\u2019s pretty customary to not invite boyfriends/girlfriends, only spouses.", "Exactly \u2026\u2026. \nWell said.", "Yes. \n\nThe real world, as opposed to the cut and dry rules of Reddit.", "Because the cousin was clearly bitching about it to his sister\u2026", "What about the other unmarried couples whose partners were invited? Why are their relationships more significant?", "You don't have to be married to be in a serious relationship.", "Brilliant, my point exactly! At 3 months, they were married! That is a very serious, committed relationship. I\u2019m sorry, if it\u2019s only been a year and no significant commitments have been made, it may not seem to an outsider that it is a serious relationship", "That\u2019s entirely culturally dependent and an assumption", "So does that mean according to you that those couples that choose not to get married but live in a committed relationship have kids etc for life would never be able to attend a wedding together. As they have no ring so no bring. How does that make sense at all. Oh that\u2019s right your comment doesn\u2019t at all.", "Maybe they\u2019ve been together longer, maybe they live together, there are so many variables. For me personally, if a couple has been together for only a year and aren\u2019t cohabiting, it seems like a relationship in the preliminary stages", "It doesn't matter about other couples. What about the children in Africa?? They weren't even aware of the wedding, yet they'll manage.  You can hypothesize fake senecios all day, it's a small wedding and her boyfriend isn't invited.  End of story.", "Remember, though, this is Reddit, so a large number of people here have very little experience with relationships in general.", "Oh no, they didn\u2019t live together when they decided to get married (and they only decided to get married because my mom\u2019s job was requiring her to move to another city). I\u2019ll have to let them know that their relationship wasn\u2019t real or significant before they had rings and a house. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be very surprised. \n\nWhat about people in long distance relationships? Those relationships aren\u2019t significant either?", "Too many unknowns to decide on that part (other couples). \n\nI mean in one friend group all our current SOs were invited to each other\u2019s weddings. But we\u2019re all pretty close friends. And oddly enough everyone who was invited to a wedding as an unmarried plus one ended up getting married to their SO. No awkward wedding photos.", "Clearly, you lack basic comprehension skills. Jump through hoops all you want, but please endeavour to come back down. Any one commitment is enough for me, personally (if you need clarification, I\u2019m saying this is my PERSONAL view), to see that it\u2019s a serious, committed relationship. What OP is describing is just a relationship. They haven\u2019t gotten married, engaged or moved in together. That is just a standard relationship"]}
