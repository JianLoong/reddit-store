Everything has been smooth sailing with my coworkers (all fun, cool ppl) until yesterday. For a little context before I get into it, my assistant manager, Sherry (45F) has a son, Travis (19M). When I first started working and met her, the topic of relationships came up and she asked if I was single. I told her yes, I got out of long term relationship this past July and I\u2019m thinking about jumping back into the dating pool. She told me her son was around my age and that we would probably like each other, and asked if I\u2019d be interested. I told her to let me think about it and I\u2019d get back to her.\n\nThat was about six weeks ago. A couple weeks ago, I decided that going on a couple first dates or outings with new people couldn\u2019t be too bad of an idea, so I told Sherry to let Travis know I was interested if he wanted to meet for coffee or something and test the waters, but that I probably wouldn\u2019t be free until just after the new year because I\u2019m busy with work and personal/family stuff. She said that sounded fine. And then yesterday happened.\n\nSherry was talking in the back room with 2 of my other coworkers, who are also moms, about their kids. At some point they were making jokes about spoiling their kids and Sherry said Travis \u201cdoesn\u2019t even make himself a sandwich, just goes into the kitchen and sits there and pouts because he knows mama will come do it for him.\u201d I rarely use this term, but I absolutely felt icked out by that. I asked her is she was being serious and she laughed and said yes, he\u2019s just a mama\u2019s boy. As we were leaving later, I pulled her aside and told her that I wasn\u2019t interested in going out with her son anymore. After she pressed me about why several times, I admitted that the sandwich thing turned me off and that I would never go out with a man who seemed so dependent or unwilling to do things himself. Sherry got upset and told me I\u2019m not a mom and don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about and that surely I expect my parents to still do things for me and stormed off. I\u2019m getting off my break here in a minute but she hasn\u2019t spoken to me ALL DAY and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m in the wrong here. Was I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone so far who has provided their feedback. I just got home from work a few minutes ago and have been trying to read through all the comments and answer any questions or provide any needed clarification. I completely agree with all of you that said I shouldn\u2019t have agreed in the first place. That was absolutely my mistake and I was entirely naive about how things would play out. It seemed totally innocent and nbd to me and I\u2019m very much used to older women in my life trying to set me up with their sons. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve had to confront the past four years because I was able to say I\u2019m taken, but now that I\u2019m single and open to trying to meet new people again, it\u2019s not as easy to navigate. I guess I didn\u2019t think much of it since I haven\u2019t dated anyone new since I was 16 and I still look at these new date situations like I\u2019m still 16. Either way, I\u2019m not mixing work with personal like that ever again. I\u2019ve learned my lesson.", "created_utc": 1671054514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm39qa/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_i_would_never_go_out/", "score": 363, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's angry because you held a mirror up to her parenting and what she saw was not as beautiful a reflection as she had convinced herself of. \n\nBut you were not rude, and you didn't say anything hateful to her. You didn't tell her that Travis wasn't someone ANYONE would date, or that she was an awful parent. You told her, honestly but thoughtfully and not-unkindly, that this was a dealbreaker for YOU, that YOU did not find that sort of learned helplessness (I won't call it dependence, because we are all dependent on each other as humans, and there's nothing wrong with needing people sometimes, but that's not this) attractive, and it's not something you can see yourself tolerating in a partner. That's very fair, and honestly really admirable in a 20-year-old. Good for you for recognising it!\n\nOh, and Sherry's \"you're not a mom so you can't understand\" thing is bullshit. My sister is a mother of FIVE, two of whom are around your and Travis' ages. One of her PROUDEST things is that she raised her kids to be kind, thoughtful, and INDEPENDENT. She isn't neglectful by any means - she's the mom who bakes cookies for her kid's entire work department on a Sunday night for the kid to take to work on Monday; but when I go to visit her, it's my niblings who will say to ME (the middle-aged lady), \"Can we make you something to eat? Are you hungry? I'm making myself a grilled cheese, do you want one?\" I have many times seen them offer to make their exhausted mum a cup of coffee or a glass of water or a snack.

The fact that you found this out now, rather than later is best. She's also likely embarrassed that her plan to pawn her good for nothing son off on you has now failed. \n\nAlso, in future never let a co-worker set up up...it's just not good to mix business with pleasure.", "THIS.  OP, my only criticism is that you should've said no from the beginning to situations like this.

I would write all of this down as accurately as you can including date and approx time stamps as well. \n\nThat way, if she tries to retaliate later, you have all this documented as well as anything in the future.

You should definitely consider learning how to broken record something--meaning, just keep saying \"oh, I just think it would be a bad idea\" and if she keeps pressing, say \"I just think it could make things awkward\" and if she keeps pressing, shrug \"I just think maybe I should date outside of work\" etc etc. I mean, too late now, but it's a good skill. Also not lying, just not the whole truth.  \n\n\nBetween her story about him and her attitude, i think you would have had a helluva ride with him no matter what. I bet he would have instantly decided you were just his thing and they both would have gone gunning for you. I hope you can work it out with her as this will likely be awkward for a while. Bullet partially dodged, but damage done.", "I didn't read it all. Don't lie. Be confident, find your voice. Advocate for yourself or someone will make decisions for you or put you in situations you don't wanna be in.", "Honey you are NOT THE ASSHOLE, but she stepped over the line.\n\nHe obviously does NOT have a father figure in his life.  ODG! My boys know how to cook and they are excellent cooks, do laundry and clean!  if anyone has ever cleaned up after boys you know why that was a priority with me.", "I just truly don\u2019t understand how someone could not be embarrassed that they failed to teach their child basic life skills. Tee hee I was an inadequate mother!", "Youre not replying to OP, you know.", "In her case, she thought that WAS her job as a mother and wife. She was raised to take care of the men in her life, her only value was being pretty and \"dumb\" so the man felt manly and took care of her.  Her father died when she was 4 and her uncle stepped into the role, and then my husband's father and then his step father.  So me teaching my boys to be able to cook and clean up after themselves was horrifying to her. lol \n\nAs a side note, she wound up having a medical emergency while visiting and lived with us for a year. Once the \"we have visitors\" masks dropped and we got back to our normal routines, she admitted that maybe she hadn't done him any favours by doing everything for him.   Some of it is our ND brains, but lack of structure as a child and teen didn't help."]}
