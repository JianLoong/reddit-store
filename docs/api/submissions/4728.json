Everything has been smooth sailing with my coworkers (all fun, cool ppl) until yesterday. For a little context before I get into it, my assistant manager, Sherry (45F) has a son, Travis (19M). When I first started working and met her, the topic of relationships came up and she asked if I was single. I told her yes, I got out of long term relationship this past July and I\u2019m thinking about jumping back into the dating pool. She told me her son was around my age and that we would probably like each other, and asked if I\u2019d be interested. I told her to let me think about it and I\u2019d get back to her.\n\nThat was about six weeks ago. A couple weeks ago, I decided that going on a couple first dates or outings with new people couldn\u2019t be too bad of an idea, so I told Sherry to let Travis know I was interested if he wanted to meet for coffee or something and test the waters, but that I probably wouldn\u2019t be free until just after the new year because I\u2019m busy with work and personal/family stuff. She said that sounded fine. And then yesterday happened.\n\nSherry was talking in the back room with 2 of my other coworkers, who are also moms, about their kids. At some point they were making jokes about spoiling their kids and Sherry said Travis \u201cdoesn\u2019t even make himself a sandwich, just goes into the kitchen and sits there and pouts because he knows mama will come do it for him.\u201d I rarely use this term, but I absolutely felt icked out by that. I asked her is she was being serious and she laughed and said yes, he\u2019s just a mama\u2019s boy. As we were leaving later, I pulled her aside and told her that I wasn\u2019t interested in going out with her son anymore. After she pressed me about why several times, I admitted that the sandwich thing turned me off and that I would never go out with a man who seemed so dependent or unwilling to do things himself. Sherry got upset and told me I\u2019m not a mom and don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about and that surely I expect my parents to still do things for me and stormed off. I\u2019m getting off my break here in a minute but she hasn\u2019t spoken to me ALL DAY and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m in the wrong here. Was I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone so far who has provided their feedback. I just got home from work a few minutes ago and have been trying to read through all the comments and answer any questions or provide any needed clarification. I completely agree with all of you that said I shouldn\u2019t have agreed in the first place. That was absolutely my mistake and I was entirely naive about how things would play out. It seemed totally innocent and nbd to me and I\u2019m very much used to older women in my life trying to set me up with their sons. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve had to confront the past four years because I was able to say I\u2019m taken, but now that I\u2019m single and open to trying to meet new people again, it\u2019s not as easy to navigate. I guess I didn\u2019t think much of it since I haven\u2019t dated anyone new since I was 16 and I still look at these new date situations like I\u2019m still 16. Either way, I\u2019m not mixing work with personal like that ever again. I\u2019ve learned my lesson.", "created_utc": 1671054514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm39qa/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_i_would_never_go_out/", "score": 4445, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He does indeed require a mother.", "I\u2019ve got three grown sons and those fuckers can cook, clean, do laundry etc.  NTA and you should be icked out.", "**NTA**\n\nSherry is offended because she just found out that she did a Very Stupid Thing in actively raising her son to treat her like his personal housekeeper, and that it turns out that now that he's reaching an age where potential serious, grown-up partners are a consideration, it turns out that grown women don't find her son's learned helplessness nearly as adorable or endearing as she does. She's angry because you held a mirror up to her parenting and what she saw was not as beautiful a reflection as she had convinced herself of. \n\nBut you were not rude, and you didn't say anything hateful to her. You didn't tell her that Travis wasn't someone ANYONE would date, or that she was an awful parent. You told her, honestly but thoughtfully and not-unkindly, that this was a dealbreaker for YOU, that YOU did not find that sort of learned helplessness (I won't call it dependence, because we are all dependent on each other as humans, and there's nothing wrong with needing people sometimes, but that's not this) attractive, and it's not something you can see yourself tolerating in a partner. That's very fair, and honestly really admirable in a 20-year-old. Good for you for recognising it!\n\nOh, and Sherry's \"you're not a mom so you can't understand\" thing is bullshit. My sister is a mother of FIVE, two of whom are around your and Travis' ages. One of her PROUDEST things is that she raised her kids to be kind, thoughtful, and INDEPENDENT. She isn't neglectful by any means - she's the mom who bakes cookies for her kid's entire work department on a Sunday night for the kid to take to work on Monday; but when I go to visit her, it's my niblings who will say to ME (the middle-aged lady), \"Can we make you something to eat? Are you hungry? I'm making myself a grilled cheese, do you want one?\" I have many times seen them offer to make their exhausted mum a cup of coffee or a glass of water or a snack. There are PLENTY of moms who do not wait on their children hand and foot, and who teach their kids to be resourceful and do for themselves and others. You are definitely NTA.", "Nta.

The fact that you found this out now, rather than later is best. She's also likely embarrassed that her plan to pawn her good for nothing son off on you has now failed. \n\nAlso, in future never let a co-worker set up up...it's just not good to mix business with pleasure.", "THIS.  OP, my only criticism is that you should've said no from the beginning to situations like this.

I would write all of this down as accurately as you can including date and approx time stamps as well. \n\nThat way, if she tries to retaliate later, you have all this documented as well as anything in the future.

You know once a year type deal. So the next time someone is trying to hook you up like that just say no. And that's it. Your allowed to have personal boundaries with people.

Not only is he clearly the type that's going to run and tell mommy and get her involved in any issue, but he'd also be thr type of person who would treat his gf or (if he ever manages to find someone) wife the same way. Years ago, I was going to school and working. I'd leave home at like 7am and wouldn't get back until between 8pm-12am. I came home one day (idr what time abymore) and my husband was all upset and hangry and wanted a sandwich. Our fridge was broken at that time, so we were using a mini fridge while waiting on landlord to take care of it. The mini fridge was literally in arms length of the computer, where my husband was pretty much all day. I looked at him, laughed and asked how old he was. Him not eating all day was not my responsibility, he's not only an adult but he also wouldn't have had to move even 6 inches in order to make his own sandwich. He made both of us food (he also made ma a candle lit taco dinner at 12am the next night as an apology). That was the first and only time he's done anything like that, it turned me off for at least a week. That kind of behavior is 100% a deal breaker and major red flags. You did the right thing by not even going on a first date with him, which is why you're nta. You just (as you have clearly realized) made a mistake by saying yes in the first place.\n\nI don't normally suggest to do fake apologies, but sometimes it's the wisest thing to do in order to protect yourself. Say something in a way so that she doesn't feel like you were insulting her as a person or mother nor insulting her son. That any problems that could possibly happen would be bc of you (let her fill in the blanks of you not being good enough for her son) and a compliment of her being a good boss that you like. If you're not worried about keeping this job, don't bother.
