{"id": 28689, "submission_id": "1757ovo", "title": "AITAH for not wanting to pay my dead ex-husbands funeral", "selftext": "Just last week on Wednesday, the father of my 4 children who are all school aged passed away. I was married to him for 20 years but decided to part ways 6 years ago after many years of being mistreated during our marriage and his alcohol abuse. After this decision, I decided to move and became the only caretaker for my 4 children without any of his financial support while he slowly went broke and soon became homeless. Being the only present parent and having to be the only financial provider for my family has been hard mentally but also financially difficult as I work 2 minimum wage jobs to support us. After receiving the news of his passing, I was distraught as were my kids as they mourn their father and I mourn the person I once loved. However, his relatives and close family have left me to do all the work from confirming his body in the mourge to planning and paying his funeral. Knowing i could never afford a funeral myself, I called his brother and told him the news and when it came to talking about the funeral he said he could not contribute as he has home renovations to pay and that I should be responsible for it since he was my partner. When talking to his aunts and uncles they not only expressed thier condolences but also expressed they did not have anything to help contribute financially. Since I am a single mother who works two jobs that barely make ends meet it is impossible for me to take this on financially. I understand if they asked me to help support since he was the father of my children however I think it\u2019s unfair for them to see me as the only one responsible for the cost alone since we were no longer married. So AITAH for thinking they should have the responsibility of financially contributing?", "created_utc": 1697006831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1757ovo/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_pay_my_dead_exhusbands/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They don't seem to care much if the concern is to renovate a house over burying a family member.\n\nThat said, cremation costs money, but if you want to make something positive out of it, there are urns that cost about $300. There's a tree seed in the bottom of it (you pick the tree) and plant it with the ashes on top. Bury the urn, which is biodegradable, and let nature take over. Eventually the ashes germinate the tree seed, the urn biodegrades, and what was once a struggle is now a tree. Out of death comes life. And your children can visit that tree without having to walk through a cemetery which can be off-putting to some people. Surely his family can come up with a couple hundred bucks each for that instead of a huge service with an expensive casket and all the things? Good luck to you, this is a shitty position to have put you in and your only obligation is to your children and making sure they're okay.
