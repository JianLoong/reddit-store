She\u2019s getting better. Or so I thought.\n\nWe were at this fancy restaurant (my mom\u2019s favourite) and there was this relatively young couple with twin toddlers and another younger kid. There were other families so they didn\u2019t stick out or anything, I just noticed them because we were seated directly beside them.\n\nThe younger one kept babbling and hitting his spoon against the table. He also knocked over a drink and spilled it all over his mom.\n\nWhen my mom noticed she gave me a look and said \u201cyou never did that as a baby\u201d \n\nI just said okay and attempted to change the conversation. Then one of the twins had to use the washroom I think so dad took him while mom and the other two kids were still seated. She was taking photos of her kids and told them to say cheese and the other twin said cheese a little too loudly before erupting into giggles. The younger one thought that was hilarious and started hitting his spoon harder. Mom was trying to take the spoon from him but the other kid was distracting her too.\n\nThis made my mom upset and I kid you not, she stood up, walked up to the woman and said \u201cexcuse me you are in public, don\u2019t bring your children to places like these if you can\u2019t control them. Just by looking at you, I can tell that the kids make the rules and you follow them. People like you give parents a bad name.\u201d She then looked at the boy and went \u201cbehave\u201d real sternly.\n\nThe women seemed too shocked to speak and honestly so was I. My mom looked real satisfied though and told me that she never let me and my siblings out the house until we were a certain age and ranted about how selfish the parents are. I was still in shock because who just... does that? I asked my mom what she was thinking and she excused her behaviour with \u201cI\u2019m a retired teacher and a full time parent, I know what I\u2019m doing\u201d\n\nThat made me upset because she is most definitely not a full time parent. Maybe for the first 5 years of my life but definitely not for a long time after that and definitely not now either. I walked up to the woman (her husband was back and it seemed like she was filling him in).\n\nI told her that I was so sorry for my mother\u2019s actions and reassured her that my mom is not someone anyone should take parenting advice from. I called her kids cute, then left after paying the bill.\n\nMy mom\u2018s absolutely furious and apparently extremely humiliated and embarrassed. She said that after I left, the woman\u2019s husband approached her and told her to mind her own problems with her own kids and it embarrassed her to death. She said that I had no right to expose our issues etc etc. I do feel a little petty and my dad thinks we\u2019re both being childish (which isn\u2019t wrong) but Jesus Christ.

Your mom DEFINITELY is an ahole for the words she chose, but it's not out of line to speak to them and tell them that their choice to bring loud kids to a \\*fancy\\* restaurant is hurting other people's ability to enjoy themselves. If I'm paying primo money to have a nice time, a kid clang clanging a spoon is going to really overstimulate not just me but a lot of other neurodivergent types. If this were the neighborhood diner, your mom would be definitely wrong, but you said a 'fancy' restaurant, and yeah for 'fancy' money there is kind of an expectation of quiet.\n\nThe only non aholes are the little kids, because they're kids and, like you, the victims of some terrible parenting.", "ESH Your Mom should not have taken it upon herself to reprimand the mother of the young kids. She was extremely rude and what she did was totally uncalled for. If she was disturbed by the way the children were acting she should have asked to be moved to another table. \n\nIt was nice of you to apologize and compliment the kids, but you took it a step too far in airing your family's dirty laundry to strangers. You should have reprimanded your mother in private.\n\nIf this really was a more upscale restaurant, then the parents of the young children shouldn't have brought them there until they were more mature. The children's behavior was fine, but a more casual, family-friendly restaurant would have been a better place to take them. People go to fine dining restaurants in part for the atmosphere, which is ruined by loud children. It's rude for parents to take their children to these types of restaurants knowing that the noise their children will be making will be disturbing other diners' quiet enjoyment of their meals.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
