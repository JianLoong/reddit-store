We moved in end of December two days after the neighbors above us(were 3rd floor they\u2019re 4th and top floor) Neighbors above us have 3 children under the age of 5. We live boring lives as we each work very high stress jobs and just like to relax when we get home. Everyday since the day we moved in the 3 children above us are menaces from 5am to 12am everyday no matter what, moving furniture, bashing heavy things on the ground, throwing themselves in the floor having temper tantrums, and sumo wrestling from what it sounds. After a week of this I decided one night to go introduce myself in case they forgot people lived under them. The mom answered the door and I introduced myself as the neighbor below and that it was nice to meet her she apologized as it was Christmas break and school was out so the kids were \u201crough housing\u201d I said i completely understand kids are kids and we left it at that. Fast forward to middle of January it\u2019s 6am on a Sunday and the little menaces are at it again like it\u2019s their job, they woke me up from a dead sleep. I go up, knock on the door and one of the kids answered the door and I asked for her mom. Mother comes apologizes and says that if I have a problem that it\u2019s not her issue anymore she cannot control her kids and that i needed to call the cops. I snarky replied \u201cif you can\u2019t control them you shouldn\u2019t of had them\u201d not the nicest thing but after losing sleep consecutively for weeks because of this i was fed up. I proceeded to email the office (mind you this entire time i\u2019ve been getting videos and proof of the noises)so they got ample amount of evidence.  She was fined by the county and told to knock off the noises outside of the ordinance hours. She didn\u2019t listen and let her children run amuck and I continued to complain every time i was woken up at 6am on a weekend. She\u2019s now been fined 5 times for a total of $4,000 and tells the office I discriminate against her because she has children and she simply can\u2019t afford the fines given by the county\u2026. i love kids but if I wanted to live with them I would\u2019ve reproduced\u2026AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: When complaining I didn\u2019t know she\u2019d get fined and I did feel bad after the fact of finding out but it\u2019s how the office handles things as me trying to be civil and maybe come to an agreement with her just did not work. I only complain when it\u2019s after noise ordinance hours and ridiculously unbearable. We also use ear plugs as well as noise machines and during the day hearing them could careless it\u2019s when it\u2019s early early in the morning and late at night. I\u2019ve also asked the management about possibly switching apartments or seeing what\u2019s available and sadly that\u2019s not an option. Also anytime the office has tried to speak to her about the noise complaints she curses them out and they have to get the authorities involved.", "created_utc": 1684094591, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hlsy6/aita_for_being_fed_up_with_the_menacing_children/", "score": 812, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
