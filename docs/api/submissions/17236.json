We moved in end of December two days after the neighbors above us(were 3rd floor they\u2019re 4th and top floor) Neighbors above us have 3 children under the age of 5. We live boring lives as we each work very high stress jobs and just like to relax when we get home. Everyday since the day we moved in the 3 children above us are menaces from 5am to 12am everyday no matter what, moving furniture, bashing heavy things on the ground, throwing themselves in the floor having temper tantrums, and sumo wrestling from what it sounds. After a week of this I decided one night to go introduce myself in case they forgot people lived under them. The mom answered the door and I introduced myself as the neighbor below and that it was nice to meet her she apologized as it was Christmas break and school was out so the kids were \u201crough housing\u201d I said i completely understand kids are kids and we left it at that. Fast forward to middle of January it\u2019s 6am on a Sunday and the little menaces are at it again like it\u2019s their job, they woke me up from a dead sleep. I go up, knock on the door and one of the kids answered the door and I asked for her mom. Mother comes apologizes and says that if I have a problem that it\u2019s not her issue anymore she cannot control her kids and that i needed to call the cops. I snarky replied \u201cif you can\u2019t control them you shouldn\u2019t of had them\u201d not the nicest thing but after losing sleep consecutively for weeks because of this i was fed up. I proceeded to email the office (mind you this entire time i\u2019ve been getting videos and proof of the noises)so they got ample amount of evidence.  She was fined by the county and told to knock off the noises outside of the ordinance hours. She didn\u2019t listen and let her children run amuck and I continued to complain every time i was woken up at 6am on a weekend. She\u2019s now been fined 5 times for a total of $4,000 and tells the office I discriminate against her because she has children and she simply can\u2019t afford the fines given by the county\u2026. i love kids but if I wanted to live with them I would\u2019ve reproduced\u2026AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: When complaining I didn\u2019t know she\u2019d get fined and I did feel bad after the fact of finding out but it\u2019s how the office handles things as me trying to be civil and maybe come to an agreement with her just did not work. I only complain when it\u2019s after noise ordinance hours and ridiculously unbearable. We also use ear plugs as well as noise machines and during the day hearing them could careless it\u2019s when it\u2019s early early in the morning and late at night. I\u2019ve also asked the management about possibly switching apartments or seeing what\u2019s available and sadly that\u2019s not an option. Also anytime the office has tried to speak to her about the noise complaints she curses them out and they have to get the authorities involved.", "created_utc": 1684094591, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hlsy6/aita_for_being_fed_up_with_the_menacing_children/", "score": 264, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not for your kids playing in their own home.", "Hahahaha I don\u2019t have kids. But go ahead, I can take it!", "They shouldn't. But just because they shouldn't doesn't mean the problem is going to go away. Families are a protected class which makes situations like this incredibly difficult. Not impossible by any means but it's much more difficult than the single guy next door who plays drums at 5am every sunday. Moreover, courts are more likely to side with tenants than landlords. The landlords would be bringing the eviction, not OP. Courts will more strictly scrutinize the landlords over if they tried to mitigate the situation to the best of their abilities over throwing a mother with children out on the street over a noise complaints. \n\nNone of us know the exact details of the situation so we have no idea how it will eventually play out. But if OP is that bothered and nothing has brought this situation to a close so far, it's not that far fetched to consider saying \"fuck it\" and finding a place to put this all behind them for their own sanity.", "I\u2019ve been there before. My neighbors would blast music so loud my apartment would shake. On top of that they had a baby and if there wasn\u2019t music blasting the baby was always crying. They also would always fight in the hallway and slam doors after midnight. I started complaining and it never got better. Then halfway through my year lease management switched and they sent letters out that they would fine tenants $500 for disruptions after quiet hours. My other neighbors told me they complained on them as well so I can only assume they started racking up fines before they finally got better.", "Kids are noisy, sure. But the entire scenario is obviously a fabricated fantasy. The mom didn't respond how OP claimed, at all. The county isn't going to fine someone in an apartment building for alleged noise complaints. OP would have no way to know how the neighbor was fined. This is all just a fantasy made up by someone with noisy neighbors who is banking on this subreddit's general dislike of children to validate this little daydream of revenge that they created.", "Yes! And make sure to file a written report with the office every time, make a note of the date & time. I HATE apartments!", "Repeatedly getting woken up 6am, even if it's \"just on weekends\", is definitely a good reason to keep reporting the family.  If anything, getting woken up on weekends is worse because many people get up later on weekends than weekdays.\n\nI also doubt that the kids make a lot of noise at 6am then are quiet little angels the rest of the day.", "Midnight and 6am is quiet hours almost every day of the week in every single apartment complex in the US. That's enough to report anybody disturbing those hours weekly.", "Half the time the reason they're screaming at that age is BECAUSE they're tired, what are you on? Not to mention, it's not like it'd just be one kid staying up the whole 19 hours and starting all the fights, unless you honestly believe a 5 year old that naps whenever and doesn't have any enforced bed time is gonna be too tired to respond to provocation that will almost definitely come in a multi-child household, much more a poorly managed one.\n\n5 ain't a toddler, it ain't a baby, it's a whole ass kid. It can play soccer. It VERY much works that way.", "Sounds to me (pun intended) that the kids are fucking up by making too much noise when they should be asleep, which is not and shouldn't be the OP's problem. Kids quiet at night when other people are trying to sleep. Straight up bad parenting.", "I don't know about you, but my sister and I were taught very early on that people live under us and it's not okay to jump around/be loud. If you live in an apartment complex, teaching your kids not to disturb the neighbors is a must.", "Google search the \u201croyal \u2018you\u2019\u201d", "Right? $4000 of fines because \"the neighbor complained about noise?\" Nope. How would OP know about any monetary fines her neighbor received?", "Midnight was only mentioned that first Xmas vaca week; after that it's only been 6am on some weekends according to the e post. That's why I asked for more info.", "That\u2019s why I said preschooler.\n\nAnd according to OP, all the kids are ***under*** the age of 5.", "From the county, obvi. You know. The County Office. Official."]}
