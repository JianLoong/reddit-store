We have been trying to work on it for a year now and it finally took off great and we were able to make a couple of sales in the last 6 months. Over the last 2 years both my husband and I have been working our asses off with a full time job on the weekdays and building houses on the weekends and haven't shopped or taken any vacation. We invested all our savings in the business and were elated when things started falling in place.\r  \n\r  \nHis brother has his own business and his wife is a housewife (no children). He makes good money and they often take a couple of domestic trips and a Europe during the year. However he's always had a problem with us, because both of us are working we have a two income household.\r  \n\r  \nAfter our recent boost in business, we decided to take a break from our jobs for 3 months and take a trip to South Asia. After coming back things were still fine and I got promoted so we were in a good place financially. I started spending money on designer items and have always had a liking for good handbags. And I am spending my own money so I don't see anyone having a problem with it. I invest 40% of my salary in stock and business, donate 10% to charity and live my life with the other.\r  \n\r  \nOne fine day my brother in law called me and said he needs $15k urgently. I asked him if everything was working well with his business. He said yes everything was fine but he needed the money and cannot tell me why. So I told him okay I will lend him the money as long as he returns it to me in a year with no interest (i think I am being reasonable enough considering he has spoken to me only once which was on my wedding). He said he doesn't want a loan but needs me to GIVE him the money because I am making too much and that I should share it.\r  \n\r  \nIt made no sense to me because his business was doing just fine. He told me because we have a dual income household and he doesn't, we should help him take care of his wife because she has been feeling left out and does not get to shop as much as I do now. I told him that is not my problem and he can simply reach out to his parents if he is short on cash for his wife's shopping expenses or she can simply get a job!\r  \n\r  \nHe said I have no right to say what my wife can and cannot do and it is my duty as his sister in law to give him money when he demands it.
