I ordered online and went to GameStop to pick up my order.\n\nWhen I got there, there was a group of friends that were scattered across the store. Two of them were in line and then two others were off to the side looking at games. The first one in line was already at the counter being helped when the second one stepped out of line to go talk with his friends. His friends were loudly talking about the new Switch and I saw them showing off the special edition box. I put two and two together and realized it was the release date, and my suspicion was confirmed when the friend at the counter was handed the box for the new one too.\n\nSince the guy who was originally in line ahead of me had stepped out, I walked up to pick up my order and asked if I could swap out the basic switch I ordered online for the special edition. The employee said yes and told me it was the last copy the store had. The guy originally in front of me heard that, and he got pretty mad and insisted that since he was at the store first, that copy was his and I had \u201ctaken his spot in line.\u201d\n\nThe GameStop employee asked me if I still wanted it, and I said that I did, so he processed a return for the one I ordered online and then sold me the special edition. The guy and his friends were giving me daggers, calling me a jerk, and heckling me about how buying the special edition when I wasn\u2019t even there for it was wrong because I \u201cwasn\u2019t there for it anyway\u201d or \u201cat the store since opening like they were.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t really engage with them, but when I was leaving, the guy followed me out of the store with one of his friends. He asked me if he could buy it and I said no, that it was mine, and while it sucks that it was the last one, he shouldn\u2019t have stepped out of line. He had a few words for me as I got into my car and that was about it. I worried they were going to follow me and try to break into my car but they didn\u2019t (thankfully).
