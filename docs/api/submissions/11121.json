Do you buy lunch every day or brown bag it? How often do you go out to dinner?)

Your measurement of temperature is irrelevant seeing how babies/toddlers are significantly colder than an adult. I mean, has no one ever told u that? I feel like that discussion is had at some point between birth & the 1st couple Dr visits. This goes for Babies that are overall healthy btw. I'm anemic & I'm always cold. I can't imagine a little 3 yr old! You mean to tell me this factor has never been a topic of discussion within visits specifically in regards to his diagnosis? If I was ur wife the thermostat would be going up regardless of how tf u feel about it. It's not throwing money away as u mentioned, it's paying for a necessity. You live in California. How many months out of the year is it cold, compared to manageable? I live in New England where I have to pay for oil for at least half the year. It sucks. It's expensive. It's necessary. Also, there are a ton of resources & programs for assistance. Maybe u can look into that. At least let someone else provide heat for ur kid rather than u denying him of it. Tf", "YTA. I'm also a touch anemic and constantly cold, like wearing sweats and socks and still under a blanket cold, even with my thermostat routinely set at 74. (No, I am not kidding. 74.) The fact that youve just chosen not to believe he's cold, and are letting him suffer instead of trying to help, is awful.\n\nFor when he's in bed, HIGHLY recommend a quality heated blanket or a heated mattress pad. They run on electricity, don't seem to make much of a cost difference in the electric bill as far as I've seen, and they're magical for keeping the whole bed warm. (There's nothing quite as nice when you're cold as pre-warming the bed and then slipping in when it's already toasty.) I wake up all the time with frozen feet even when it's positively balmy in the house, and you just can't sleep like that. He needs to be comfortable at night so he's not horribly sleep deprived during the day.\n\nI understand that the cost of heating the whole house can be a bit much, and maybe everybody else is comfortable with it lower, but if that's the case you need to do more for little dude's individual comfort. Make sure he's got stuff like warm slippers, maybe heated electric socks if he wants them. I use fingerless gloves a lot when I'm doing tasks where I need my fingers like typing, but I even have a few with the fold down mittens. You can get him a reusable hot pad or hot water bottle (bonus if it's something he can re-warm himself when it cools off; many types warm in the microwave, and they make versions that are like stuffed animals). Give him better ways to self regulate his temperature and hopefully he'll be more comfortable and won't be depending on your total lack of empathy when he needs to warm up.", "YTA, why not compromise and get a space heater for his room if one can safely be put in it?", "Can you maybe get an electric blanket for him?", "YTA", "Your son is THREE.  You know he has a health condition that makes it likely he will feel cold.  And you deny him the warmth he needs because you are too damn cheap to pay for it.  Oh, and justify yourself by 'not believing' that he's really that cold.\n\nBuy him a warm onesie for the daytime and a heated blanket for night time.

He has a medical condition that causes him to not be able to heat his body properly no matter how many clothes he's got on. 65 is too cold for many people who don't even have that medical condition. Maybe you should go donate a couple pints of blood and see how warm you are afterwards AH. Do better.", "YTA, I'm paying a hell of a lot more than $300 a month ($600 for December to January), but I have to keep the house warm for a 90 year old relative.

Getting into an already warm bed makes a huge difference."]}
