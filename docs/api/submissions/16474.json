Your sister is being unreasonable. \n\nWhen and if she does have a child of her own, she is free to name the baby whatever name she wishes, including the name that's presently the subject of this dispute.\n\n No one owns a name.

Regardless, the name means something personal to you and your husband, and she isn't even pregnant or even involved with anyone at this time. She does not own the name. She cannot claim something that isn't even in the works. She won't even know when she gets pregnant and even then, if she's going to have a girl or boy. That name is yours for the taking.

I'm not the protagonist of anyone else's reality, so it's not that hard.", "From the headline, I was planning to say yes.... but after reading NTA. You can't lock down a name until your partner agrees... and even then, if there's some other reason for it (like a family name from his side), then tough.

It's not like we got a George Forman headache going on.", "Your sister is ridiculous. \n\nShe reminds me of my first adult dog rescue. Dog was found wandering, no name before AC got him.
