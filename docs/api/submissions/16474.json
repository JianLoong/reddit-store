You have a child and have the right to name him whatever you want. Your sister doesn't have a kid to name so has no stake whatsoever. When she does have one (if she gets one) to name, she can name it whatever she wants to. If she wants to use the same name, then she can do so. There isn't a limited amount of times a name can be used. There's not less name in the world when someone gets named.
