It sounds to me like your husband is trying to soften the blow of the birthday drama, rather than just letting it all land on him. Maybe HE has actually spoken to said child and knows something you don't. Try talking to him. It doesn't sound to me like communication is a big thing in your house. It's just \"This is how it's going to be - Deal with it.\" Guess what? Kids don't respond well to that. They are VERY sensitive to what is going on around them. They are trying to deal with a new family dynamic, INCLUDING a new baby in the house. So, not ONLY are they dealing with EACH OTHER, now they have to contend and compete with a BABY for your attention, and we all know who is going to win THAT battle. Baby. Obviously. Baby needs more attention. Duh. But a CHILD doesn't understand that. You and your husband SERIOUSLY need to sit down and have a chat with your kids about everyone's \"place\" in the family and make sure that the kids know that their \"place\" is secure, because it sounds to me like your stepson doesn't know that, and he is acting out, trying to get your attention, because for kids, ANY attention, good or bad...it's attention, and they will take it. And if you don't do something about it NOW and make sure that BOTH of them know NOW that they are secure, it's going to get worse, I promise you.
