It sounds like he feels left out. Maybe try sitting down and TALKING TO HIM. I know, it's shocking, having to actually TALK to a child with words.

It sounds to me like your husband is trying to soften the blow of the birthday drama, rather than just letting it all land on him. Maybe HE has actually spoken to said child and knows something you don't. Try talking to him. It doesn't sound to me like communication is a big thing in your house. It's just \"This is how it's going to be - Deal with it.\" Guess what? Kids don't respond well to that. They are VERY sensitive to what is going on around them. They are trying to deal with a new family dynamic, INCLUDING a new baby in the house. So, not ONLY are they dealing with EACH OTHER, now they have to contend and compete with a BABY for your attention, and we all know who is going to win THAT battle. Baby. Obviously. Baby needs more attention. Duh. But a CHILD doesn't understand that. You and your husband SERIOUSLY need to sit down and have a chat with your kids about everyone's \"place\" in the family and make sure that the kids know that their \"place\" is secure, because it sounds to me like your stepson doesn't know that, and he is acting out, trying to get your attention, because for kids, ANY attention, good or bad...it's attention, and they will take it. And if you don't do something about it NOW and make sure that BOTH of them know NOW that they are secure, it's going to get worse, I promise you.

Etc.\n\nThey don't \"not have money\" because it wasn't the result of a legal employment contract.\n\nOdin's eyesocket, I had a bank account when I was... what... 10, I think? Maybe 11? Sometime around there.", "Did you even read the post? The dad asked the mom to give the kid money so he can buy stuff on the other child's birthday. Its money provided by the parents for a specific purpose not \"his own money\" or allowance even if i go by your logic", "Adding a few things here:\n\nMy daughter has no clue that he is now attending as this was something that literally happened and I posted this as I\u2019m processing it to see if I was over reacting as husband stated or if I was valid in where I stood.\n\nMy daughter asked for us to take a day out as a family. Stepson was to be at moms so it was going to be her, myself, my other two kids and stepdad. He\u2019s been a part of every birthday he just happened to be with mom this time. My husband made the phone call and then told me after ward and then said that he would be bringing his own money to spend and it wouldn\u2019t be taking away from my daughter so \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to freak out over\u201d.\n\nSome have suggested that I\u2019m making this a big deal and that I could reverse the roles when it\u2019s stepsons birthday. Yes, I could.. but the second that I treat my stepson differently than I treat my biological children it\u2019s an issue. If I make my daughters birthday about her I have to make his about him.\n\nMy daughters request: we live in a small town and the closest town with a good mall with actual choices or even an outlet mall is an hour/hour and a half away. So, she chose for us to take the day and go walking through these two specific malls within 10 mins driving distance of eachother (one indoor, the other outlet style). She wants to go to this park and have dinner/dessert all in this town. One of the malls has a specific thing for selfies and she\u2019s super interested in that right now. That\u2019s what she asked for regardless of whether stepson was with us this day or not. But the fact that he is with us if it\u2019s something he doesn\u2019t want to do it\u2019s a problem and a fit. Yes, husband could go off with him and it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal any other day. But it\u2019s a day for her and about her. And yes, I could go off with my daughter on his birthday or with my son even but then that would be an issue because my stepson would acccuse me of picking them over him. It\u2019s a lot of crap honestly. So we set the birthday rule specifically to give that person their day and make it about them.\n\nMy stepson doesn\u2019t do chores to earn money. Since his moms been an absentee the last years she literally buys him. I mean this not in a shaming way but I have never met another 11 year old with yeezys, the big red boots that trend on tiktok, PlayStation 5, AirPods, iPhone, he got a new 4 wheeler allll this summer because \u201cit\u2019s what makes him happy\u201d. Any time he\u2019s come to our house this summer he comes with money she gives him to spend and I\u2019m not talking $20 here or there but like $200 In his wallet each time he comes and because \u201cit\u2019s his money\u201d there\u2019s nothing I can say about it. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s right that he takes his son off on a shopping spree on the one day my daughter has that she wants us to spend with her. He also doesn\u2019t understand the concept of being humble. He will flash his money and the things that he gets and that his dad takes him out weekly anyways so this would be twice in a week. He already gets the extra from his dad to help him out and give him the consistency and the attention he needs. This is not something new. We\u2019ve been together 7 years and he\u2019s lived in my home for 4. He\u2019s been in therapy for 4. \n\nI can\u2019t uninvite someone I never invited. I wouldn\u2019t have an issue with him coming along if he\u2019s going to be civil and have a good time. He can behave it\u2019s just situations and circumstances that he chooses not to. It\u2019s a choice. Yes, he has adhd and he has learning disabilities but he doesn\u2019t qualify as disabled in school or by our state. He isn\u2019t in special Ed. He is very gifted and bright. So I\u2019m not picking on him. \n\nI\u2019m not bitter or have an issue with my stepson. I just simply don\u2019t agree with this for my daughters birthday because if roles were reversed it would be a shit show for me to leave and go off with my kids on a day that\u2019s supposed to be about him.", "I think I\u2019m going to bring it up to my daughter to just have a day out her and I instead of it being a family thing. That\u2019s honestly probably going to be the easiest way for no one to feel some type of way or the kids to act out. Thanks everyone for your input!", "NAH. Maybe dad is trying to keep the peace so that OP daughter can have a fun day without stepson. Anyways just take your daughter out and make sure she has a blast.", "NTA why not take your daughter for a special mother daughter day that is just the 2 of you?", "YTA. You know the boy will act out but you're too dumb to prevent it. At least his father came up with a plan.", "NTA i have been the child before it\u2019s kinda hard. My little sister always cried when she wouldn\u2019t get presents when it was my birthday. Please try to communicate with your husband on trying another method? This can become a big issue as the kids grow up and the relationship between everyone. Kids need to learn to respect others\u2019 time and special day. It can also show your husband\u2019s kid that if he can cry and irritate him which makes the dad just do what he wants to make him stop, he will continue.", "NTA\nLet them do this little plan. \nWait until stepson's birthday.\nTake your daughter out to get stuff she wants on HIS birthday. \nSometimes you have to fight petty with petty.", "Your tone comes off super condescending as you\u2019re assuming we don\u2019t have these talks in our home. We do. My stepson is in active therapy. He goes weekly. Whenever something is brought up in therapy that needs to be adjusted or addressed in our home we do so. I also am in active therapy. Talking about thoughts, opinions and feelings are something that happens in my home a lot. So I know how my stepson feels. I have never been a person who believes that \u201ca child should be seen not heard\u201d because that\u2019s exactly how I was raised and I\u2019ve strives to do better as a parent. But, I also know my stepson acts out on purpose too. He has even admitted that. He doesn\u2019t always think about the consequences of his actions. He\u2019s super impulsive.", "NTA. Husband needs to take his son shopping a different day.\n\nI'm still pissed that my 14th birthday was about my sister. Mom took me to the mall to buy me a new outfit and she thought it was a good idea to also bring my sister to buy her clothes fir an upcoming trip. She got a lot more on my birthday than I did.", "YTA.  I don't think you like your stepson much and feels it and is jealous of your kids and wants the attention.  Why can't he buy himself something?  Lighten up and be nicer to him."]}
