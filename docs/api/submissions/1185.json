After all that she tells me I can leave her house and never come back. I really don't know what to do atp and the whole situation is just crazy.

When did her mom die? What does she say behind your back? What \"personal business\" does she tell friends and family?", "ESH. She is the parent and is clearly not respecting your boundaries and appears to be taking some anger out on you, which is not fair. If you can get away from the house, even just for a few days, It'll do you both a world of good.
