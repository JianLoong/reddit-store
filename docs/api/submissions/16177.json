After a bad breakup they asked if I could move in to help with bills. \n  Things were fine for awhile. Then I found out that my child was being bullied by the MIL. Belittling, and berating, with name calling. My child started showing signs that something was wrong as she became withdrawn, depressed, with panic attacks. When I pressed the issue I found out the truth. I confronted my dad and MIL on how my child was being treated and its unacceptableto treat her that way. Especially knowing that we already went through mental and emotional hell with her father. I beat myself up for not escaping that relationship sooner. But I take her mental health seriously. I started sticking up for her and for doing so I was asked to move out.\n   I went to grab the last of my possessions which included my 2 dogs, I got my oldest dog. But the MIL refused to give me my puppy saying \"attachment was formed\"\nI told my dad he can keep my dog but to never talk to me again.This was the tipping point from a life of disappointment, I hold a lot of resentment to him. He was an absent father growing up and has constantly let his wife disrespect his only 2 kids as we were growing up, they've been married only 5 years, together 20 years.\nI sat at his wedding in the first row and watched him take family photos with the MIL when they got married 5 years ago, but not one photo with his kids, but all of her extended family are in those photos.\n    Someone exposed my location to my dad and he has showed up unannounced twice and gave me 3 dates to pick from to get family portraits done with my new baby sister. First stop by I never agreed to pictures to begin with, only saying ill think about it. 36 years old and not one time has he had family portraits done. But since the new baby is in the picture they want pictures with siblings and the grandchildren. I refuse, I set a boundary and cut ties with him. He is coming around like things ended on good terms. He doesn't understand that im really mad at him and this is not something I will sweep under the rug. I can take whatever you want to say to me, but do not go at my child like that, blood means nothing when it comes to her.\nI was told by an acquaintance that im kind of an asshole for not giving my sister a chance to see me even in a photo.I feel its better to not be around then to have the question \"why doesn't big sis come around?\" She has a chance to grow up with my dad actually being a father, I don't need to ruin that image for her.
