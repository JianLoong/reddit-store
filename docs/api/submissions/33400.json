They had to live with us for a couple of years due to some circumstances and that worsen their relationship. I blame it mostly on my parents as they tried to provoke my husband quite often by making comments about his habits, appearance, etc. Especially my mother. And it was becoming increasingly worse, he simply couldn't do anything right in their opinion. My husband tried to avoid any confrontation by limiting interactions with them, even though they were under his roof and were disrespectful to him (his empathy of their situation and age, and for the sake of my relationship with them). But one day both of them poked him to the point that he flipped. They said that he has anger issues. \n\nAfter that it was mutually decided that they have to move out. It took them some time to find the place, and during that time my husband completely distanced himself from them. To the point that we were not having meals together at all, not being in the same room, etc. Of course that was taking as an offense by parents as well.\n\nThey recently got a new place and moved out. We (me and my husband) haven't seen or been to the place yet. Now my mom calls me last week and invites us for Christmas,  which I gladly accepted and viewed that as a potential 1st step to start fixing the relationship. But then she says that it's only me and our 2 kids that they want to see \"we don't need him here\" her exact words about my husband. I was flustered, made quick excuse that the work call was coming in and hang up. I didn't say anything to my husband,  I was simply ashamed of that invite and didn't want him to get hurt. I thought through the whole situation for a couple of days and how to respond without arguing and then simply texted my mom back \"we'd like to spend the day together, just 4 of us at home\".\n\nI was hoping they get a hint that it's unacceptable for me to come over with kids, but not husband. Then my  dad writes to me that I should be ashamed of my decision and the way I made my mother upset. And that I should not call him, but think hard about my decision. I got sick to my stomach, and felt like I'm being emotionally manipulated into guilt tripping. That made me very angry and I ended up calling my mom and trying to explain how wrong their invitation was - was a mistake on my end, as emotions were high. I should have just kept it quiet. And of course she victimized herself even more. They ended up calling me raging and hysterical, reminded me about my rebellious teen years (God knows why), and told me to call them only when I'm ready to talk.\n\nHave no idea how to go from here.\nAITA for refusing to come over for Christmas knowing that it'll upset my parents?

They are AHs, well and truly.", "NTA why do you keep rewarding their bad behavior with your time and attention?", "I read a term on here \"cry-bully\" and it perfectly describes your parents.\n\nThey act like assholes but when called out play the victim.\n\nYou should not feel bad about declining their offer. It was offensive for them to even expect you to leave your husband alone on christmas.\n\nYou are NTA.", "YWNBTA. You HAVE been the AH, however, for letting it get to the point that your husband lost it. You should have been telling them from day one that it stops, or they\u2019re out. And acted on it.", "NTA for this situation but why did you allow your parents to treat your husband like that in the first place?? That\u2019s awful. Your parents are rude and manipulative. Don\u2019t let them guilt trip you. They owe you both a massive apology.", "NTA. Good on you for standing by your partner. \n\nWhen a couple is married they are a single unit. An invite for one is an invite for both (with a few obvious exceptions, like gender-specific events). That goes double for the holidays and family events. Wanting to spend Christmas with your immediate family (which, now that you are an adult, means your spouse and children, not your parents) is neither raging nor hysterical, and it certainly doesn\u2019t make you a rebellious teen.", "YNA. You didn't overreact. Like, at all. I wouldn't go over to my parents if they denied my partner of 15 years to join me. I'd have no association with them unless my partner was there. If they wanna blame it on you being rebellious in your younger years? Well, tell them that will always be you. Rebellious. Rebellion against their mistreatment of your husband. Just because they don't want him there? Doesn't mean jack if they desperately want your company. They would grit their teeth and bear it. Because you come packaged with him. They're disrespecting you, your marriage, and your husband. Unacceptable. You can always love your parents from a distance.", "Jeez Louise. The audacity of your parents, depending on you and your husband\u2019s charity and hospitality, and not even showing basic decency, much less appreciation.\n\nI suggest reading the book \u201cAdult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents\u201d I suspect it will be enlightening, and give you some strategies to understand and manage your parent\u2019s behaviors.", "NTA. I would NOT go to any major celebration holiday without my spouse. Maybe a casual Sunday afternoon coffee drop in, but that is it. I\u2019d give them a hard no on excluding my husband from Christmas.

You let them walk all over you still. Grow a backbone and tell them they accept your entire family or none.

They can call you when they are ready to apologize.", "NTA\n\nI would accept the invitation to stay no contact. You are a grown woman who is entitled to set your own terms in your relationships.

To be respected, you have to be respectful and respectable. \n\nYou have the husband. You have the kids. You have the house. You hold the cards.", "NTA. Your parents are being obnoxious assholes. They hate your husband, even though he gave them a place to live when they needed it. They are manipulating you and you should not let them get away with it. Spend Christmas with your husband and kids and let your parents know that you and your husband are a package deal and it is time for them to get the fuck over it.", "YTA. Not for declining the invite but for not setting your parents straight. In their eyes, they had to move out because your husband was upset, not because they were disrespecting him. This time, its because you want to spend the holidays at home as a family, not because they are continuing to undermine your marriage. You have to spell it out for them. Yes, they\u2019re assholes and narcissists probably.

They were mooching off you while biting the hand that was feeding it. Now that they are out they want to flex and make you conform. Sadly they are pushing you to choose them or your husband.
