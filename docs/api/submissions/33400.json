They had to live with us for a couple of years due to some circumstances and that worsen their relationship. I blame it mostly on my parents as they tried to provoke my husband quite often by making comments about his habits, appearance, etc. Especially my mother. And it was becoming increasingly worse, he simply couldn't do anything right in their opinion. My husband tried to avoid any confrontation by limiting interactions with them, even though they were under his roof and were disrespectful to him (his empathy of their situation and age, and for the sake of my relationship with them). But one day both of them poked him to the point that he flipped. They said that he has anger issues. \n\nAfter that it was mutually decided that they have to move out. It took them some time to find the place, and during that time my husband completely distanced himself from them. To the point that we were not having meals together at all, not being in the same room, etc. Of course that was taking as an offense by parents as well.\n\nThey recently got a new place and moved out. We (me and my husband) haven't seen or been to the place yet. Now my mom calls me last week and invites us for Christmas,  which I gladly accepted and viewed that as a potential 1st step to start fixing the relationship. But then she says that it's only me and our 2 kids that they want to see \"we don't need him here\" her exact words about my husband. I was flustered, made quick excuse that the work call was coming in and hang up. I didn't say anything to my husband,  I was simply ashamed of that invite and didn't want him to get hurt. I thought through the whole situation for a couple of days and how to respond without arguing and then simply texted my mom back \"we'd like to spend the day together, just 4 of us at home\".\n\nI was hoping they get a hint that it's unacceptable for me to come over with kids, but not husband. Then my  dad writes to me that I should be ashamed of my decision and the way I made my mother upset. And that I should not call him, but think hard about my decision. I got sick to my stomach, and felt like I'm being emotionally manipulated into guilt tripping. That made me very angry and I ended up calling my mom and trying to explain how wrong their invitation was - was a mistake on my end, as emotions were high. I should have just kept it quiet. And of course she victimized herself even more. They ended up calling me raging and hysterical, reminded me about my rebellious teen years (God knows why), and told me to call them only when I'm ready to talk.\n\nHave no idea how to go from here.\nAITA for refusing to come over for Christmas knowing that it'll upset my parents?
