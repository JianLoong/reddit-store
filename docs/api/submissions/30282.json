When my Italian friends have time, they don\u2019t use canned tomatoes. Not that there\u2019s only one way to do things, but the real issue is your partner\u2019s blatant lack of respect.", "Your partner has fixed ideas, and seems to like to steamroll over others, flattening things they don't recognize or have the wit to appreciate in their wake. If they wanted 3 cans of Kirkland tomatoes for their base, they could have brought out a new pot, and made their own 'custom' creation, leaving you to live yours. NTA", "Put two Italians in the  kitchen and you'll have at least 4 \"right\" ways to make sauce -- all of them different.  I do draw the line at putting ketchup in it like my mother in law used to do.  Anyway, were you trying to make Italian pasta sauce? or something from your garden that your kids got to help you with?  Doesn't matter; you are NTA.", "NTA, it's your project and you didn't ask for help. Even if you *were* messing it up, you're allowed to!", "NTA. And to be clear, I mean that. Your partner was the AH in this scenario.\n\nJust a bit of food for thought. Many people from many countries have very fixed and firm ideas about their native foods and offense can be taken when changed in another country and called the same thing. While upu did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG here, a suggestion you can take or leave would be next time you're doing something Italian is to involve your partner and learn the old ways. \n\nThat does not make you the AH though", "NTA but you should have put your foot down. Tell her to butt out.", "I hate food snobs. NTA.", "NTA \n\nYour partner was rude as hell (but do need to agree with them about the celery, where was your recipe from?)  \n\nBut at no point did you mention that you told them to stop messing with your cooking.I don't understand why you suddenly started following their orders.", "Those italian snobish people are so annoying. You get the same kind of person in France. Call it fusion if it please him, but this is YOUR project as you said and he doesnt get to tell you how to do it. \n\nIt would be alot of fun to send him a receipe of pinoy spaghetti tho.\n\nHere in quebec we do our sauce with a ton of vegetables and whatever we want and even a bit of sugar because it taste great and we do not waste our time wondering what an italian would think about it. Because big scoop, culinar culture is in constant evolution just like language is. NTA", "Sorry but who is supposed to be the asshole? Don't come between an actual Italian and sauce. My friend is from near Florence and I'm frequently heckled", "Doesn\u2019t really seem like anyone is being a real asshole here.  They shouldn\u2019t have jammed you up on your project and you should have just explained it (why does no one in this sub talk).  \n\nAll that being said, if it wasn\u2019t good and they made it better\u2026 then good for them lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm afraid in my family the only way we achieve this is getting loud with wine.  Hugs.", "Okay they were rude to be honest. But you don't add veggies to pasta sauce as a rule. It's a slow cooked tomato sauce with usually a secret combination of herbs. \n\nHowever there was no need to be cruel, or dismissive.
