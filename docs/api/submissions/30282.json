NTA", "Put two Italians in the  kitchen and you'll have at least 4 \"right\" ways to make sauce -- all of them different.  I do draw the line at putting ketchup in it like my mother in law used to do.  Anyway, were you trying to make Italian pasta sauce? or something from your garden that your kids got to help you with?

Your partner was the AH in this scenario.\n\nJust a bit of food for thought. Many people from many countries have very fixed and firm ideas about their native foods and offense can be taken when changed in another country and called the same thing. While upu did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG here, a suggestion you can take or leave would be next time you're doing something Italian is to involve your partner and learn the old ways. \n\nThat does not make you the AH though", "NTA but you should have put your foot down.

I really hope others chime in with ideas how to communicate with your partner so the next time you cook with the kids, everyone is giddy and there's \\[pasta noodles\\] on the ceiling.  I'm afraid in my family the only way we achieve this is getting loud with wine.  Hugs.", "Okay they were rude to be honest. But you don't add veggies to pasta sauce as a rule. It's a slow cooked tomato sauce with usually a secret combination of herbs. \n\nHowever there was no need to be cruel, or dismissive. I've often done just that to get my kids to eat veggies", "OP wasn\u2019t making Nonna\u2019s sauce, they were making OP\u2019s sauce.

But double sad for you that the kids had their project bulldozed as well.", "Hmmm I bet your Italian partner is American... In that case remember him/her that those milliliters of Italian blood he/ she has dont mean a secret culinary knowledge", "Their Italian family doesn't know about soffrito(celery, onions, and carrots)?", "NTA. Your partner is. If they were indeed so skilled in cooking, they would know that carrots, onion, and celery are considered \"the holy trinity\" for a base of a sauce. It is called mirepoix and Italians call it soffritto. They actually have their own word for this trifecta of base aromatic veggies!", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all I'm actually italian and can confirm that your recipe is perfectly fine. But that's not the issue here.\n\nThe issue is that your partner sounds like a very unpleasant person who acts like a dick. Regardless of whatever specific \"sin\" you supposedly committed, which you didn't by the way, a good person will never behave unpleasantly like your partner did.\n\nMy grandma could see me put pineapple in a tomato sauce and she'd just be like, well honey that seems unusual, I'm curious to try it when you're done. BECAUSE SHE'S NOT A DICK. \n\nSo my question is rather 1) why are you with such an unpleasant rude person and 2) why didn't you use your words and stop them from tampering with your sauce?\n\nYou're an adult and you're not a prisoner. You don't have to sit there quietly when people are dicks to you. You can stop them or you can choose to surround yourself with better people.", "NTA. Your partner is TA. Did you tell them this upset you? Did you tell them they were spoiling your project? Next time say, \"These are my tomatoes, this is my recipe, I haven't asked for feedback, and if you don't like it then I'm gonna do like that Little Red Hen and eat the goddamn sauce on my own!\"", "NTA  I'd be upset.", "NTA. I would say give her the taste of her own medicine and when she protests, remind her what she did to your project.", "NTA within one village in Italy there are loads of different ways to make sauce which are used for different things.

They put all sorts of vegetables in their food. Italian food is more than just tomatoes, pasta and parmesan", "Why are you with someone like that? Exaggerated mocking, belittling, and sabotaging are not good qualities in any person let alone a mate", "Any good Italian knows not to fuck with someone making sauce from fresh tomatoes with fucking canned bought. \n\nShe's a bad Italian and im so sorry she ruined your project. Nta.", "NTA. Your partner was *really* rude and disrespectful. Are they often like this?", "If I am cooking and my SO so much as stirs something without being asked, you\u2019d better believe words are going to be said!   LOUD words.  LOTS of them!  Possibly accompanied by GESTURES!", "Come on, Gonorrhea, as a fellow Italian you should know that calling this crap spaghetti is a mortal sin.", "Must be olive garden Italians", "I'm Italian and my grandma always puts onion, carrot, and celery in her tomato sauce... To me that's the \"old way\". It's also the old way to not be a rude shit when you don't like something.\n\nOP's partner isn't being \"italian\", they're being an absolute dick and that's got nothing to do with pasta sauce.", "The thing is, it's usually Americans with an Italian great great great grandfather who act insufferable claiming to be the ultimate custodians of the \"right\" way to be italians. In actual italy we know that the next region over will have totally different recipes amd every grandma will have her own individual recipe, so we know better than to fixate on one specific way as the supposedly \"italian\" one.", "It's not wrong, though! Onion, celery, and carrot is called sofritto! It's the base of Italian cooking! Would you stand up for anyone messing with your cheese and macaroni?", ">(but do need to agree with them about the celery, where was your recipe from?)\n\nSounds like OP was using soffritto/mirepoix, which sounded normal to me because that's how I make my red sauce. Aromatics add depth of flavour, but you traditionally wouldn't use soffritto for passata (it's supposed to be purely tomato and nothing else).", "I'm Italian and my grandma always puts onion, carrot, and celery in her tomato sauce \ud83d\ude0a", "Not just the celery. But the chopped carrot. My Italian (step) Grandmother would do a whole carrot(or potato if she was in dire need) to help with the acidity.", "Sofritto. Onion, celery, carrot. Italian base for many recipes.", "Holy crap, OP. I'd have gone full Italian and wiped my tomato stained knife on her best dress. \n\nI also use sofritto to cook lots of dishes. It's the flavour base! I make sofritto in large amounts and freeze it in smaller portions so that I don't have to chop everything on demand every time. \n\nMy husband is from South Africa, and I'm Australian, we stay out of each other's way in the kitchen unless asked because we respect each other. \n\nSeriously, I'd find Italian blood I don't even have to take revenge here.", "NTA You\u2019re very patient, I blow my top if someone interferes with my cooking. Yes I am part Italian. There isn\u2019t one right way and it\u2019s good to experiment especially with tomato sauce because the acidity/sweetness of the tomatoes can vary.", "Well it's obviously not how his grandmother did it. I think you completely missed the point in favour of outrage", "It's called sofritto. It's the proper way.", "Ah yes, the Americans. I really don\u2019t understand why they try claim another culture for themselves. They\u2019re not Italian or Irish or french or Jaba the hutt. UNLESS, they hold dual citizenships. Otherwise they\u2019re just embarrassing.", "Exactly! No sauce is the same, no matter where it's from!  OP's wife took a shit on him.", "My point was that OP didn't do anything wrong by using a different recipe than what the partner is used to because whatever recipe partner knows is not the be all end all of italian tradition. Her recipe is perfectly fine.\n\nEven if OP was branching out making a totally new recipe, that still wouldn't give partner the right to act like a complete dick about it. His behaviour is an issue here, the fact that partner is an unpleasant person is an issue here, not whatever \"sin\" OP supposedly committed (which she didn't commit, by the way) in partner's eyes.", "Italian-Americans are claiming *their own* culture for themselves. They're Italian-American. When they say \"Italian\" we all know that's shorthand for \"Italian-American\".", "FFS what did I say in my judgment.  OP DID NOTHING WRONG", "That's good to know and I sincerely hope you're right regarding the majority. My one experience however with meeting an Italian Am\u00e9rican abroad was different. He told me he was Italian too and really insisted trying to convince me he was just as italian as me, someone who actually grew up in Italy. I'm sorry to say I got a bit snippy at him because he was being very irritating.", "When someone says their Italian they mean they\u2019re Italian. As in, they were born and grew up in Italy. Not America.", "OP did it exactly right! Don't worry about that bugger."]}
