Imagine planning a party all about someone else's baby when you dont have your own. It's like a constant reminder of what could have been.\n\nThats awful that your brother doesn't even speak to his sister about these things tbh.", "He's so wrong on so many levels. That your sister should just cancel it. That your SIL would want to plan it. She very likely won't be able to attend and you need to let her know that you understand. He needs to know that this will not help her move on. That asking would be a huge burden and horror for her. NTA", "NTA\n\nFirst, I find appalling that your husband, a man, thinks he knows what's the best way for his sister to grieve her pregnancy loss. Not only does he think he knows what's best for her but he is so convinced he won't even ask her about her feelings. This is so so absurd.\n\nSecond, I'm flabbergasted that he also thinks what's best for you and is unwilling to consider your thoughts about this.\n\nGreat way to take away the agency of the two women he's supposed to love.\n\nEdit: grammar", "Your husband is a complete idiot. NTA.", "NTA - Your husband is right about people processing differently, however, he doesn't even know what his sister wants and is just assuming - and based on her reactions, she may not want to be a part of it at all. \n\nHe's not really taking into account what YOU (his pregnant wife) wants. He might just be looking for some sort of quick fix. This is also rude to your sister who's ALREADY planned it out. \n\nAt the very least it should be discussed and IF she does want to plan, she can  \\*help\\* your sister (if both of you are okay with that). After all it's your baby shower.", "I agree with you. first of all, it is YOUR baby shower, not hers. it's a special moment and if there is a chance that she will feel like it is upsetting and it backfires, I would not let it. you aren't selfish, you've thought it through. even if she did want to do it, he has no right to manipulate you into feeling guilty about wanting your sister to continue to organize it. she already planned it, and you're 7 months pregnant. you don't need added stress about how things will be handled or done with a new person taking charge. he should apologize for trying to make you feel bad about that.", "The road to hell is paved with good intentions. It's nice that your husband wants to help his sister cope with her loss, and if it was certain that organizing the baby shower would help her, it would be worth a thought to change plans even at this point- but we don't know that, and neither does he!\n\nMy first step would be to make two things clear:\n\n* Is there any way to have your SIL help your sister with the baby shower - ***if she wants to***?\n* Will this actually help your SIL cope with her tragic loss?\n\nYour sister can tell you about the first, and for the second, I'd turn to your mother-in-law. She has known your SIL her entire life, and undoubtedly has been in contact with her after the miscarriage. Get her perspective, and don't do it alone. Hubby had the idea, he can pitch it to his mom, and you can make it clear that you appreciate his effort to help his sister, but are unsure whether it will help. You can just say that you don't want it to look like you're flaunting your pregnancy in front of your SIL. \n\nI'm a bit concerned by the fact that your husband seems impenetrable to reason on this. Calling you selfish when valid logistical and emotional arguments are presented against the idea make it look like willfull ignorance on his part. However, he might be desperate to cheer his sister up, and thought he had a great idea, so having it quickly shot down by reality was probably a huge disappointment.\n\nNTA, and a mild TA for hubby for how he handled his plan being rejected.", "NTA. Your husband is incredibly stupid and insensitive. No woman wants to throw someone else\u2019s baby shower just after losing a wanted pregnancy. She can\u2019t even stand hearing about your pregnancy atm. His ignorance literally makes me want to throttle him on behalf of his poor sister. I feel his idea could be considered nothing but cruel to her. Do not mention anything to her, if he\u2019s insistent then he can be the ah & ask her himself. See how well that goes for him. Ooof this made me mad..", "NTA - Why would he bring it up without even asking her? How ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYOur husband is an AH, to you, to your sister, and to HIS sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis idea that it would be good for a woman who lost a pregnancy to organize a baby shower is ridiculous.", "NTA and the only person who should, if she feels it, is your SiL. Your hubby is out of touch. And even so, it's already in the works. \n\nI get he's just thinking he can help her. It's sweet, if misguided. He needs to back off.", "NTA - at first I was expecting you to say your SIL was the one pushing the subject/wanting to take over which I would of said probably isn\u2019t a healthy coping mechanism as someone who suffered from infertility baby showers were one of the worst things to do with. I am currently pregnant from IVF after 3 years of trying & when we told our families my SIL told us later that she had just recently miscarried and then within another 2 months she miscarried again. It was an awful feeling knowing what she was going through while we were progressing in our pregnancy. I was very aware of not making her feel like we had to talk about it / my pregnancy unless it was something she reached out about while also telling her I was there at any time she needed. She reached out to me about a month before the baby shower and asked what she could do as I hadn\u2019t asked her and I told her honestly I didn\u2019t want her to feel like she needed to do anything that was hard but I appreciated that she wanted to help and got her to help with a cake/food. \n\nBut the fact it\u2019s your husband pushing it without your SIL seemingly having any idea to this is even worse. I can appreciate he clearly wants to help his sister and I\u2019m sure probably has some guilt that he gets to have a baby while she\u2019s lost hers at the same time but this would probably push her further away, making her feel like it is being rubbed in her face or that he\u2019s taking pity on her. \n\nI would recommend if you have a decent relationship with your SIL reaching out to her and speaking to her about if she feels like she cannot come to the baby shower you support her 100% or if she comes and decides it\u2019s too much she has your support. And that she can also let you and your husband know what she needs from you in regard to healing e.g. pregnancy updates/ultrasounds.", "NTA. What a dumb a$$!!  Tell him to ask his sister if she even wants to attend a baby shower. After she gets through with him, he will be ready to sit down and STFU!", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is assuming. There is no proof his sister wants to throw you a baby shower.\n\nErr on the side of caution and don't have your SIL organize your shower.", "NTA. One, it won't heal your Sil, it will make it worse. Two, it's your baby shower, not her's. So you husband is the one in the wrong for trying to pressure you into this.", "NTA\n\nThe easiest solution to this is to cancel your shower vendors and let SIL have this one small thing. /s\n\nYour husband is an idiot. Your SIL can't even handle discussing your pregnancy, but she's capable of planning your shower?", "Your husband is a complete arsehole and has no compassion for his sister. How can he NOT see that she's grieving, and the very last thing she needs is to organise a celebration for someone who's got something she has so painfully lost.\n\nMake sure your sister doesn't press for her to attend, and maybe drop her a note to let her know you understand the depth of her grief and you will do your utmost not to remind her of her pain.\n\nAnd tell your husband to back right off from his sister and learn a bit of empathy, because he isn't just being inconsiderate, he's being downright cruel.\n\nAs for you, definitely NTA", "NTA\n\nSIL didn't even mention your baby shower. Keyword being YOUR baby shower. If SIL even wanted to be a part of it, she would have said something. She just lost her baby and you're currently pregnant. I highly doubt your baby shower is on her mind.\n\nYour husband had good intentions, but then he reached AH territory when he tried to push SIL into a situation that she never even asked for in the first place. It would totally come off negatively if you were to ask to SIL to plan a baby shower from scratch after losing a baby. Plus, your sister already planned everything.\n\nIf your husband wants to support SIL, he should ask her what she needs. He should not overstep his place and insert her in the middle of something. He should also not insert you into that situation.\n\nIt's your baby shower. So it is defiinitely about you and your baby.", "NTA\n\nDo you think it would help your husband to understand his sister\u2019s grief better if he read the replies to your post?", "NTA No matter his intentions this is one of the cruelest things I\u2019ve ever heard. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she thought you were rubbing your pregnancy in her face. \n\n I just can\u2019t fathom how your husband ever thought this was a good idea in the first place. But to then see she can\u2019t even handle hearing about your child AND disregarding your opinion as a woman who had a miscarriage is just\u2026 wtf? Oh and your sister is supposed to just happily waste all the time and money she\u2019s already spent planning your shower?!? And you\u2019re the selfish one\u2026 jfc.", "NTA\nThis is your babyshower, not someone else's therapy session.\nHow very disrespectful would it be to your sister, to have all her work be for nothing, just to make someone else feel better.\nAnd did SIL even ask, or is this all a weird theoretical scenario your husband thought up?\n\nIf you have a good relationship with MIL, and you can't reason with your husband about this,  bring it up to MIL, that your husband keeps insisting, your baby shower is already planned, and you doubt this is really SIL'S idea,  and you don't want to hurt her with this discussion. \n\nWhy on earth is husband even putting this stress on his pregnant wife in the first place?", "NTA - Your husband is an insensitive idiot. As someone who\u2019s had fertility problems too, I wouldn\u2019t even want to go to a baby shower let alone organise it.", "NTA. And your husband is an idiot.", "Absolutely NTA.  I\u2019ve had multiple miscarriages I couldn\u2019t imagine planning and throwing a baby shower for someone else while in the thick of things.  Especially when they already have someone else doing that for them.  I guess you\u2019re husband is grasping at straws and trying to find a way to fix things for his sister, but she just needs time to work through her grief.", "NTA and Please! share this post with your husband.\n\nHe is a loving brother who does not want to see his sister in pain. That is the only good thing that can be said here about him.\n\nHe is not just being horribly foolish, he is being actually HARMFUL to his sister. (Not to mention completely rude and inconsiderate to you - his wife - and your sister.)\n\n1. He has absolutely no idea of how hard it is to have just suffered a miscarriage and have to see/think/hear anything about someone else having a baby.\n2. He has more faith in his uninformed, inexperienced, unfounded notion than he has in your actual experience of being in the same shoes as his sister. Does he think his notion trumps the actual experience of hundreds of women who have suffered miscarriages? How many of the folks responding here are telling you (and him) that \"*Yeah, throwing someone else a baby shower right after I miscarried was just what I needed to feel better*!\" I'll tell you how many: ZERO! (And I'm sure the count is the same for men who said that idea worked for their wife or loved one.)\n3. He sees his sister hurting and wants to solve her pain, needs to do something... anything. It's a hard lesson for many folks to get, but - often - doing something/anything is more harmful than helpful, and some hurts and sorrows need time to ease. (They may also need things like therapy, but) They cannot be rushed to ease his distress at seeing his sister hurting. **His rush to do something to make his sister feel better quicker is more about HIM trying to feel better than he realizes**.\n4. So what can this loving brother do for his sister? (1) be willing to share her suffering for longer, (2) not IMPOSE quick-fix-hairbrained-'cures' on his sister, (2) get informed and give more weight to the guidance of others who have experienced a miscarriage, (3) consider asking his BIL for his perspective on what would be helpful for sister (and BIL), (4) consider asking his mom how she thinks sister is doing and what support she needs right now \\[I'm not dissing your perspective at all. I'm giving him the two people closest to his sister to provide him their perspectives.\\]\n5. Notice that I haven't even got to how wrong it is for him to decide to make you responsible for making his sister 'better'. If he wanted to shave his head to support a cancer-stricken sister, that would be his choice. But it would never by OK for him to say that YOU had to shave your head because that would make his sister feel better. \\[Sadly, there have been posts of people doing exactly that!\\] The reason, this is not even mentioned until point 5: As bad as it is for him to ask you and your sister to just cancel everything that's already been done and to just take away this shared experience and gift from your sister... as bad as that is, it's not even close to how bad the impact of his idea would be on his own sister.\n6. I wonder if your husband has this subconscious feeling that it's 'unfair' for you and your sister to get to enjoy the planning of a baby shower while his sister is grieving. It is sad for his sister but not unfair to her. But maybe it's hard for your husband not to feel guilty about your family's joys when his sister is hurting. Whether this is a factor and/or his wanting to act now to make her pain (and his) go away is a factor, it may help your husband to talk with a counselor to help him sort through all that, understand what his bothering him and healthier ways for him to move forward.\n\nI hope everyone involved here can find some healing and peace. Good wishes to you and your extended family.", "NTA. Everything is already planned and paid for and he wants your sister to cancel so HIS sister can do it? A month after her miscarriage? Has he even asked her if that's something she'd *want* to do? \n\nI'm with you. Having her plan your baby shower isn't going to do anything but rub salt in the wound.", "NTA. Your husband is a moron.", "I can assure you with almost zero doubt your SIL does NOT want to organize your shower.", "NTA. It\u2019s likely your SIL won\u2019t even want to attend the baby shower much less organize it. He is a completely insensitive ass to think that would help her in anyway. \n\nIt has only been a MONTH.

They are both babies regardless of how long they grew for in the parents eyes.  \n\nEveryone grieves differently.  A grief counsellor for your SIL, if she's open to it, may be more beneficial than forcing her to follow someone else's plan for her grief journey.\n\nBut the reason you need to talk to your SIL is to let her know that you are there for her if she needs someone, that she doesn't have to attend your baby shower (would she like an invite anyway), and to let her know what her brother wanted you to let her do.  There may be a deeper issue within the family and she needs to know that someone is looking out for her that's attached to that side of the family.", "Yeah NTA. He is running on pretty strong assumptions here. This is probably the last thing she wants to do for anyone right now.

He's never had a miscarriage but he certainly seems to be an expert on how to force someone to try to get over it.

Your husband would do much better to call her and ask her how she is, invite her out for quiet lunches and dinners. Invitations to a movie or museum. Sadly, there is no way to just snap out of grief.

So it could be helpful to talk with her and find out how you can support her so he feels that he is helping her in some way.

And personally, I think it\u2019s extremely disrespectful to both of you given you have firsthand experience with this and given SIL hasn\u2019t expressed any interest in throwing you a shower to you or to him.
