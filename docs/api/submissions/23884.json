When I was a kid, we were visiting friends in Per\u00fa. We were doing a roadtrip through some gorgeous roads, when we spot two llamas. They looked like they had escaped from somewhere. There were wearing rope bridles and somehow the dangling ropes had gotten entangled with a barbed wire fence. We stop, and my dad, a friend and myself try to help them. We spend a good fifteen minutes trying to untangle them since we had no knife or any other cutting tool. We finally get the mess sorted, and the llamas are freed.\n\nThat's when they decided to say thanks by unleashing a torrential rain of spit. We ran full speed to the car, while being bombarded by phlegm. It was like a bad war movie. \n\nI've seen llamas up close a number of times since them. I always keep my distance, and my guard up!", "NTA - Fuck him for not listening, and fuck llamas. Getting that mix of phlegm and stomach acid spit in your face is horrible. He should've listened.", "YTA just for making me read \"pube in the pie\"", "BLS...?", "NTA, don\u2019t llamas do better in herds? Aren\u2019t they the animals that can develop a berserk syndrome?", "NTA serves him right", "> to show his kids they aren't dangerous \n\nThis part makes you teeter on the edge. Sounds like laughing at BIL was deserved, but if his kids were young enough to be freaked out or upset seeing a llama bean their dad in the face it might have been better for you to handle introductions, or at least add a second warning when you saw it coming.\n\nStill going to vote NTA. You did warn, it was predictable, and ultimately it was up to the llamas whether they wanted to spit, not you.", "Info: are you just bragging?", "YTA. He might have lived there in the past, but it's easy to forget certain details. They are your animals and you have responsibility over them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
