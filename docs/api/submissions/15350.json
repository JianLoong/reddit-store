They've had their problems every once and awhile, but to me it seemed like they always worked through it. I know he absolutely loves her and I thought they were very close.\n\nBut three days ago my son came to my door at ten at night drunk sick and in complete tears. I guess she'd been cheating on him for some time, and during an argument she finally admitted it.\nHe just fell apart, he could hardly breathe right. I cleaned him up and put him in bed, and that's about where he's been since.\nHe looks ill, he won't eat, I've never seen him so upset. \nHis wife and her family were calling us both repeatedly but we just didn't deal with it at first. He was devastated, I wanted him to have a moment to gather himself.\nThis morning I bit the bullet and answered her call. She was angry he had walked out and left her with their daughter and said she just wanted to talk this out like adults.\nI told her that she could talk to him when he chose to contact her, and that I think he'd want to work something out but she needed to give him some space.\nShe got more upset and I told her she couldn't throw a fit here.\nShe stormed off, and I don't know what she told her family, but I've since gotten calls from her mom begging me not to let him leave her and their daughter, her sister called to berate me for protecting a deadbeat father, they're all freaking out.\n\nHe isn't \"abandoning his family\", his life has been turned on it's head and I want him to have some time to find his feet. It's just been three days, it's not like he's run away.\nBut now everyone is angry at me for \"letting my son leave his daughter\", which he absolutely adores that little girl, he'd never just up and leave.\n\nSo am I the asshole for letting him stay with me to get away from his family? I know it leaves his wife in a tight spot, but it's been THREE DAYS and she hardly works part time, it's not like he's left her with an impossible task.\nAnd I absolutely intend to have my son deal with this, but I just can't see him feel like this, and I don't think he could have any meaningful conversation this way.\nWhat should I do? I'm not trying to let him hide from his responsibilities, but he's hurting and needs time to breathe", "created_utc": 1682092540, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12u8ucc/aita_for_helping_my_son_avoid_his_family_after/", "score": 270, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I commented this elsewhere, but imo the correct order of priorities is:\n\n* child's needs\n\n* parent's needs\n\n* parent's wants\n\n* child's wants\n\nHere, we have a conflict between what the parent needs (space to recover) and what the child needs (reassurance that daddy still loves her and that he isn't gone). Between the two, the child's needs ought to take priority.\n\nSo OP should be facilitating some sort of contact with this poor four year old girl and OP's son needs to pull himself together for a few minutes to give the kid a hug, tell her \"daddy loves you, he's just sad and needs some time to feel better\" and reassure that poor kid. \n\nAnd then, if he needs to cry and be alone after because all of this hurts *so much*, that's 100% okay.

Why?\n\nWhy punish a child for the actions of their parent? How is THAT more fair? \n\nHe did nothing wrong in that situation (the cheating), *but neither did the four year old girl.* As the adult who raised that child, if he cares about her then yes, I absolutely DO expect her to be compassionate to that child and not leave her feeling like dad has abandoned her.\n\nBeing a parent is about a LOT more than just DNA.
