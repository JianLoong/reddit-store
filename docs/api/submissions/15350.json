They've had their problems every once and awhile, but to me it seemed like they always worked through it. I know he absolutely loves her and I thought they were very close.\n\nBut three days ago my son came to my door at ten at night drunk sick and in complete tears. I guess she'd been cheating on him for some time, and during an argument she finally admitted it.\nHe just fell apart, he could hardly breathe right. I cleaned him up and put him in bed, and that's about where he's been since.\nHe looks ill, he won't eat, I've never seen him so upset. \nHis wife and her family were calling us both repeatedly but we just didn't deal with it at first. He was devastated, I wanted him to have a moment to gather himself.\nThis morning I bit the bullet and answered her call. She was angry he had walked out and left her with their daughter and said she just wanted to talk this out like adults.\nI told her that she could talk to him when he chose to contact her, and that I think he'd want to work something out but she needed to give him some space.\nShe got more upset and I told her I wouldn't talk if she was going to throw a fit, so she hung up. I don't know what she told her family, but I've since gotten calls from her mom begging me not to let him leave her and their daughter, her sister called to berate me for protecting a deadbeat father, they're all freaking out.\n\nHe isn't \"abandoning his family\", his life has been turned on it's head and I want him to have some time to find his feet. It's just been three days, it's not like he's run away.\nBut now everyone is angry at me for \"letting my son leave his daughter\", which he absolutely adores that little girl, he'd never just up and leave.\n\nSo am I the asshole for letting him stay with me to get away from his family? I know it leaves his wife in a tight spot, but it's been THREE DAYS and she hardly works part time, it's not like he's left her with an impossible task.\nAnd I absolutely intend to have my son deal with this, but I just can't see him feel like this, and I don't think he could have any meaningful conversation this way.\nWhat should I do? I'm not trying to let him hide from his responsibilities, but he's hurting and needs time to breathe\n\n\n\nSome additions and edits for clarity: of course we've discussed the possibility that his daughter might not be biologically his, but *he doesn't plan to abandon her regardless*. He loves his little girl and would despite anything. \nAnd as far as if her family knows the full story, I have no clue.

If he drove to your house drunk, I would wonder if he gets like that at home regularly. Clearly you feel strongly about cheating, but is he just telling you that so that he can get away from his family and do what he wants to do? To polarize you from his wife and muddy the waters? A responsible parent would certainly be devastated, but by now he should have reached out to discuss an informal verbal custodial arrangement. How does a woman who works part time with a baby even have time to cheat? None of this makes sense.", "Somewhere between NTA and ESH. While you\u2019re not an AH overall, you really should consider that his daughter is now three days without her dad with only her shitty mother\u2019s explanation for why he\u2019s gone. He can opt out of being a husband to process and that is fine, hell it\u2019s expected, but he shouldn\u2019t be opting out of parenting as he is doing and you ought to talk to him about getting his daughter over at your house for a while.", "Idk, he has left his daughter without contact for at least 3 days with no end in sight. He owes nothing to the mom, but it\u2019s messed up to abandon the child", "I love people like you saying the dad needs to basically man up and go on with his life like usual but if it was a female\u2026 she needs time to heal, you need to give them time, stop pressuring her, give her space, etc\u2026 your double standard hypocrisy is disgusting.", "The wife obviously took some personal time away from her family. If he needs a few days off, its not forever. Tell the kid daddy is on vacation for a few days, act normal. He'll be back.", "Potentially, but they've been together for 6 years and the daughter is 4. Which means she was conceived a year into their 6yr relationship. It's much much more likely that she's his daughter and the cheating is something that developed later in the relationship. \n\nI'm not arguing that it's not still really hard, but given she's most likely his daughter his number one priority still needs to be making sure she's ok in all this.", "I think they key thing here ain\u2019t that she cheated, it\u2019s that her cheating may have caused their daughter to not be his. \n\nIf the genders were switched it would be an unfair comparison because the woman would know it wasn\u2019t hers.", "In my opinion? There would be a lot more sympathy.\n\nCommentors would tell her to take some time off, get her shit together and then go back to her kid. This sub is heavily biased by gender, and there\u2019s been multiple gender swaps where the same scenarios have two different votes because of the gender of the person writing the post. Hint: it almost always favours the woman", "You're getting downvoted for the reason you're 100% right - this sub can be sexist AF. Makes me laugh every time I see people going on about it being anti-men because iF yOu sWiTcHeD tHe gEnDeRs... as if it makes sense to ignore the different conditioning of women and men, and the glaringly unbalanced statistics on abuse, housework and mental load. \nIn this case, dude is getting all the sympathy and the (female \ud83d\ude43) child he abandoned is expected to just suck it up, since the sub has decided in advance that sHe iSn'T eVeN hIs!", "Must be nice to live in your delusional world where women are treated with dignity and compassion.", "Nah. I know plenty of people who learned they were being cheated on for the whole relationship. Or who started cheating 3 months or so into it. Length of time in the relationship doesn't necessarily lessen the chance she was cheating back then too. She just may not have gotten caught. Probably from him just trusting her.\n\nDNA tests are also kept so taboo that many don't ask for it for fear of ruining a relationship, when really they should just be a standard at this point. Because like really if it's not taboo anymore what happens? People that can't be trusted get busted. And people that CAN be trusted just have another Tuesday. It feels like it's only kept taboo so toxic women can avoid accountability.", "I agree that he should see the kid, but not move back with the wife.  if she refuses him access, that is on her.", "And then the bio father can make himself known. And kiddo can decide on contact once she's old enough to make that decision.", "that legally might not be true", "She is.. cheating is abuse", "Yeah I agree he doesn't need to move back in but he does need to see his daughter and figure out that arrangement. He should probably consult a family law attorney.", "having his name on the birth certificate and parenting her for 4 years would mean a lot But unfortunately biology does come into play and if he's not biologically her father I'm worried that that would greatly hinder his ability to demand the custody he wants. I understand that he's willing to parent her either way and that's incredible. But the last thing you want in the middle of a custody hearing is a surprise. Or God forbid the actual biological father is used by the mother as a tool to get rights for him that can be used by her. I just want him to protect himself and the relationship he has with this kid that he obviously loves very much", "Cheating is a cruel and disgusting act, but it's not abuse. \n\nAbuse is a pattern of intentionally harmful behaviors toward another person for the purposes of control. This can be physical (e.g. slapping, shoving, punching), verbal (e.g. belittling, insulting), or emotional / psychological (e.g. manipulating, antagonizing, gaslighting).\n\nWe know that his wife cheated on him at least once, and that is a despicable act. But it is not abuse. Now, the constant fighting? The fact that she brought it up in the midst of an argument to get him to react a certain way? Sending her family members after him and trying to emotionally manipulate him using his daughter? THESE are behaviors that could indicate an abusive relationship.\n\nAs an abuse survivor, I feel very strongly that we should not trivialize the word by applying it to every toxic behavior or situation. The same goes for other words the internet likes to throw around, such as trigger (an involuntary psychlogical and/or emotional and/or physical response due to past trauma) and gaslighting (a specific form of psychological manipulation meant to make the victim question their judgment and perception of reality). All abusers are toxic people, but not all toxic people are abusers. It's important we remember that.", "I think a DNA test is a good idea, but just to know whether, down the road,  another man could possibly try to take his daughter.", "I really feel if the man cheated and the woman was at her moms(same exact story just switch roles).  the reaction would be the same. He would probably be talked bad about and people would generally  say \"give her a moment because hes a jerk. He can watch his kid for a couple days\" Maybe I'm wrong though.", "Funny how the father and father's family have zero obligations. Lol, your misogyny is so hilariously clear.", "Bruh, my experience as a woman on reddit the last ten years has been very eye opening to how women are treated on here. Those examples I used in my first comment? Just in the last couple of months alone. Not even from years ago.\n\nPeople would call a cheating man an asshole, yes, but they're not gonna let a mother leave her kids for a couple of days to sort her shit out. Seen it too much.", "Well that's the million dollar question isn't it?\n\nWho's the father?", "Even if most people don't know their family medical history I think most people would agree that it's good information to have. It's not good to be unaware but sometimes that's our lot, in his daughter's case it doesn't have to be.", "Because it would be her kid without doubt, she can't *unknowingly* give birth to a kid that isn't hers.", "The  4 year old sees that dad left and mom and dad are mad at each other.  A kid that age doesn't understand what is happening so invariably they think they did something really wrong and dad's leaving was due to that.\n\nThis little girl needs to get a reassuring phone call from dad, hopefully  dad sees her in the next week.", "Very much agree.", "I hope you don't have kids and force feed them your warped morality of unreasonable self-sacrifice.\n\nI bet you think this OP, \n\n[AITA for asking my eldest daughter to sleep on the couch temporarily until we buy a new mattress?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uuijw/aita_for_asking_my_eldest_daughter_to_sleep_on/)\n\nIs N T A."]}
