Last Friday night, my husband Oliver (M54) and I had my sister Marie (F50), BIL Frank (M52), and nephew Aaron (M17) over at the new house we had moved in two months prior. For backstory, my kids (F28, F24, M23) have all moved out permanently as of a year and a half ago. Oliver and I had always planned on getting a smaller house after this, and we found one that was actually really nice. The new house was significantly smaller, but it was still spacey and even had a pool and hot tub outside, so Oliver and I were pretty excited. I told Marie about the pool and hot tub in advance and told her they could try it out.\n\nAnyway, we were all outside, and Oliver was grilling steak and hot dogs. Marie, Frank, and Aaron were wearing swimsuits and relaxing in the hot tub. I decided to join them and went inside to change. I just put on a regular white bikini and went in the hot tub. Marie had a mildly awkward look on, but she didn't say anything. I asked Aaron how senior year was, and that started up the conversations before dinner was ready.\n\nThe next morning, I got a call from Marie. She told me that she didn't want to say anything earlier, but she had felt it was inappropriate that I wore something as exposing as that in front of my own nephew. For context, Marie had worn a one piece. I told her she was being ridiculous and that it wasn't weird. I brought up the fact that I had literally gotten to see Aaron after he was born, and the kid even liked blowing raspberries on my belly when he was super young. I don't know, I'm just being an aunt. I  myself was even intent on not having kids for a while when I was young. \n\nMarie called me \"disgusting\" and hung up. I was bombarded with texts from her, Frank, and some other relatives that I was being gross and showing indecency towards my nephew. I can't deny it hurt my feelings, but I also am starting to wonder if I'm setting a bad example. Oliver is completely on my side, and we haven't told our kids about this.
