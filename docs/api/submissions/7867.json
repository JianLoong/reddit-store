I was clearly upset over what he said but he acts like I shouldn\u2019t be upset over what he has chalked down and convinced himself was a \u201chypothetical situation\u201d instead of a serious topic and conversation and that I was giving him an \u201cultimatum\u201d \n\nWe ended up arguing about it all night and he just couldn\u2019t get off of it.

He wants to move closer to his support system while taking you and your son away from your support system. He wants children but doesn't want to commit. He wants you to give but only wants to take. The game-playing and manipulation are only going to get worse. The whole relationship cannot be conducted exclusively on his terms.

He's not considering your kid and will bail on you within the next 6 months.\n\nEdit: I'm sure he knows you would need court approval to do this or your child's fathers approval... However, you will 90% most likely end up in court over this while he leaves and you now have a huge court expense and some additional bull sh*t.

Sounds like he's playing you and are you by any chance from NJ?", "This move would be a huge commitment on your part, and should only be undertaken if you see a future with this person. Given that you are being asked to uproot your life, as well as your child's, marriage is hardly an unfair ask. \n\nIf he can't see your feelings and is now trying to rewrite the conversation to fit his version of events, that's worrisome.

You would be silly if you didn't get a serious commitment from him before uprooting yours and your child's life for him.\n\nHe's obviously not serious about you if his response was to not even consider it and then say you can just stay here.", "Just sayin. A ring will most likely not fix him tbh.\nAnd if he divorces you just soon after you will be just as bad off\u2026", "NTA. He\u2019s asking for a huge commitment even if you didn\u2019t have a child in the mix. Asking for a compromise on his side is not an unreasonable ask even though he\u2019s making it sound like it. \n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned what he wants and the sacrifices he\u2019s asking you to make.

He\u2019s telling you he wants to move in 6 months, while also saying it is hypothetical?

And WTF does leaving in 6 months have anything to do with anything? I planned my wedding in less time, so have many many many others. Sounds to me like he wants to talk the talk but avoid the walk, little commitment-phobia. DO NOT back down.", "NTA and that's reasonable! He wants you to uproot your life, and you are asking for a commitment. They go hand in hand. But take his reaction as a red flag. Let him move without you. And you can start over. He is not the one.", "NTA. Don't expose your child to this man who does not care about your child. Taking your child away from their father is significant and yes, traumatizing. I don't see a good reason for it. If he goes, consider it a blessing. You do not want someone around who will not treat your child with the love and care they deserve.", "NTA. Break up with him.", "NTA  \"I can't uproot my life and drag my child away from their biodad for a mere boyfriend\"\n\nAnd given that he wants to make you his trad wife, and that seems to not be what you want...

He obviously wants to have his cake and eat it.", "NTA. Moving away from everyone you know is a hard thing and you should never do it for a man that you aren\u2019t even married to.

The way he reacted shows that he\u2019s not serious about your relationship.", "Girl - believe me when i say that you absolutely under no circumstances ever want to marry this guy. \n\nPlease be glad that he is moving away, cut your losses and find someone else\n\nNTA", "In a rare case, I'm going to say NTA for giving ultimatum for marriage lol 95% of the time that's a shitty thing to push someone into doing, but in this case I think you're legit in that. Like you said, you'd be making an enormous sweeping change to your life and and your kid's life, and jumping through lots of hoops to make it happen all for his dream life, so I don't think it's out of the question to ask that of him at all.", "NTA  \n\n\nalso sounds like he has 0 intention of marrying you but every intention of making you his wife (probably means mother)  let him go on his own", "NTA. Beyonce has it right.", "NTA. Show him the door. He wants you to make massive sacrifices and make your child move away from the father but he doesn't even want to propose to you? GTFO, this relationship is not good for you.", "NTA - he doesn\u2019t want to marry you. He just wants a bang maid\u2026", "NTA, marriage is one big insurance policy to guarantee that you\u2019re both in it for no reason other than that you want to be inseparable.

One thing to be aware of in these types of situations - the one who cares the least has the most power.  Him giving you that ultimatum like it's no big deal if you leave, tells you he doesn't care.  Now maybe he's just calling your bluff, but you will only know if you hold your ground and he finally caves and proposes - but is this the kind of person you'd want to marry?", "NTA for only wanting to move your whole life unless you're married. He said he's not planning to marry but is planning to leave in six months. I doubt you can change that. And even if he married you, it sounds like he'll be making all the decisions like where you live, sacrifices you make, how many kids you have. Be sure that's what you want.

You are worth more and better off without that jerkazoid", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Is your son\u2019s father a good dad?", "Listen to your gut feeling!!!!", "I love this!", "I need to write this down...", "Agreed. She's already got her answer because it was definitely not a hell yes.", "Sounds like he's just asking way too much and not willing to give in return and that's always a red flag for any relationship. Might be a big red flag honestly.", "He\u2019s asking for *a lot* from you without firm commitment. Is he also expecting you to have multiple children without engagement? Hell, I know people who won\u2019t even buy furniture with their partners before engagement.", "I don\u2019t mean to be unkind but It doesn\u2019t sound like he loves you", "No argument there I definitely wouldn\u2019t go through all that when this guy I\u2019d stringing you along", "Doesn\u2019t matter if the dad is in your son\u2019s life and it try to take him far away, bio dad could get an emergency order forbidding it", "If you really had no idea, then he sprung this on you in public to try to force your hand. Be careful.", "So he had previously voiced this as a plan, but there was suddenly a timeline attached?", "So you had discussed having multiple children together but never discussed marriage EVER. Maybe if you agree to 7 children that will be enough to convince him to marry you?", "My son is almost 4", "I think he is.", "Yeah. We actually had planned on getting a place out here together\u2026 He had voiced before that he would eventually like to move to the East coast. This 6 month thing was news to me. It was almost like he decided for me without involving me in those decisions.", "Either way do NOT under any circumstances move to the other end of the continent with this man. EVER! Please! Believe me when I tell you this will end horribly", "Then why even have this fight? You can't actually leave. Even if the court would let you, which they won't for some effing guy, you can't rip your child away from a good dad for this guy who sounds super immature.", "Look. I was a single mom. It can be lonely, and dating with a kid isn\u2019t easy. But don\u2019t let this guy convince you that you deserve anything less than to be valued and cherished. You said you love him. But I don\u2019t see that he values you or your love. \n\nLet him go. Wait for someone who will treat you and your child with the care you both deserve. Wait for someone who cannot wait to marry you. Who will shout his love for you to the world. Who will allow you to prioritize your son. That\u2019s worth waiting for. I promise it is. \n\nI hope that I didn\u2019t sound too harsh. I wasn\u2019t trying to be.", "Then why on earth would you take your son away from his dad for a man that cares so little about you that he won\u2019t  even commit to you? \n\nSeriously. I know love can make us irrational, but I think you really need to prioritize your child, and not your bf. \n\nGenuinely I\u2019m not trying to be unkind. I\u2019m sure you love your son. Don\u2019t let this dude trash your life when he clearly doesn\u2019t care that much about you.", "Shocking huh /s", "I will choose my son every time. Which feels like I\u2019m having to choose between the two with the way he operates. Which hurts, a lot. I love him.", "If he loved you the way you love him, he would give you space to truly prioritize your child. Any man that asks you to choose him over your kid isn\u2019t worth having.", "He doesn't love you, OP. Take the blinders off."]}
