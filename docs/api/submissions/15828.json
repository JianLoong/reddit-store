We split the chores and I do most of the cooking, especially dinner. I don't really have a set time that I cook, it's pretty much whenever I get home and am able to. If I make things in one pot or without a protein there aren't usually issues except that she complains that she doesn't like how it tastes heated up. When I prepare a protein with it, its a whole other story.\n\nWhen I start cooking or tell her that dinner will be ready in 15-20 minutes she gets busy. She'll do things like take a long bath, go to the gym, go on a run, go down a few blocks to visit her parents, visit the neighbor, or start to snack. I've tried asking her many times if she doesn't like what I'm cooking or how I'm cooking it. I've tried asking her if there is a time she wants to eat, I've told her when I plan to start cooking and when she can expect it to be done. I get a whole lot of 'no' and that she likes my cooking but then she complains that the food is cold, or the meat/fish gets overcooked when she goes to warm it again, or if she nuked it in the microwave its rubbery.\n\nFor the last few weeks I've just stopped cooking her portion of protein. I'll make the sides, get her portion seasoned or dressed and she can just cook it when she's ready. It's been a bit of back and forth between us now and she cooks her portion while griping. Last night I was making us french bread pizzas. I had one prepped with toppings I like and one prepped with toppings she likes. I let her know I was going to put them in the oven, and off she went to her parents house. Okay. I waited to put hers in and after 30 minutes I just covered hers and put it in the fridge so she could bake it when she got home. When she did get home an hour later, she went to the kitchen and opened the oven and then the microwave and then asked where her pizza was. I told her it was in the fridge waiting on her to bake it. That started a fight and she accused me of trying to control when she eats. I told her yet again I couldn't care less when she eats, I care that I put time and effort into our meals only for her to complain its cold or ruined because she waited so long to eat it.

You're just supposed to then stop cooking until she comes back or is ready to eat? Cus that's what it sounds like.

I put a lot of effort into cooking things my hubs can/will eat, then at the five minute warning, he gets his phone and wanders off to the bathroom. It is infuriating.", "NTA. Girlfriend sounds like she enjoys being annoying.", "NTA- this has nothing to do with food. She\u2019s manipulating you in a corner so you are always in the wrong And its never her fault.\n\nyou\u2019re the cook. dinner is served at such a time. If she misses it, toss it.", "NTA. GF sounds a bit spoiled.", "I'd stop preparing her food at all! She can do it all herself. She's treating OP like a personal chef.", "Couldn\u2019t say it better myself, lol. But I seriously wonder if he\u2019s asked straight up why she\u2019s behaving this way. It\u2019s downright odd for anyone older than a toddler - and so consistent? Like why does she keep avoiding eating a fresh hot dinner?", "idk why but the reasoning for this verdict appearing in the top comment is hysterical", "NTA but was looking for this. I've battled anorexia and bulimia, and had this weird transitional period as I recovered where I'd pull exactly this kind of shit because I'd have to burn enough calories beforehand, have full control over what/when/how I ate, almost psych myself up for food, etc... \n\nIt was still selfish and an AH move to my mum and then partner, but I didn't see it at the time. Therapy is a good shout. ED/disordered eating may not be the situation here but definitely worth considering.", "Let's start a club! I remind my partner of my schedule and anticipated dinner time in the morning, tell him when I'm starting to cook (including how long it will take), tell him again five minutes before it's ready and set the table. He'll either continue working for half an hour, go into his room to fox some stuff, start meddling with something else, play with the cats, ... - I've taken to eating my serving and getting on with my day. He just complained that the stew I served him an hour ago has gone cold - uhm, I don't control physics around here? There's the microwave! (And I do love him and he can eat whenever he wants, but some days it's rather trying.)\n\nETA: NTA. She can eat whenever she wants but you don't habe to cook whenever she wants.", "No matter what OP does, he\u2019s wrong. \n\nOP, please don\u2019t have children with this person. My husband was raised by someone like her, and his psychological wounds are deep and permanent.", "OP's situation is lose-lose. NTA", "Honestly, it sounds like she's the one with control issues.", "What would she do if you cooked it and then put it in the fridge afterward?  Eat it cold?", "My husband was exactly the same way. I had to sit down with him and explain how it drove me up the wall. It turns out that I (who was raised in a cold climate) had it drilled into me that it was incredibly rude not to be on time for dinner, and that we had to eat straight away so it wouldn't get cold. I probably had overly obsessed relatives on this score. He (who was raised in a very hot climate with an apparently overly forgiving mother) was never taught that it was rude or disrespectful, and didn't understand why I was getting aggrieved. It's not like their food was getting cold sitting on the table when he was a kid. He started finding me rude when I stopped serving his dinner up in frustration. After we hashed it out, we both agreed that he would at least not go and start something new after I told him that dinner was nearly ready but I'd wait a couple of minutes for him to finish up whatever he was engrossed in and/or go and wash his hands.", "I recall that post. It was ridiculous", "I first thought it was one of those idiotic relationship tests. Put OP in a situation where he can't win and see how he reacts. But I like your idea better.", "Idk, I have a feeling she'd manage to control or punish OP with that in some way as well. She's got some weird issues that are cropping up here around food and control that she should look into getting some help for, because the extent of her avoidance, and her anger about the resultant issues, is pretty extreme.", "Exactly\u2014it sounds thoughtful. OP can\u2019t win", "Complain about the texture when it's reheated, isn't that one of the things OP says she does?", "That IS functionally an every day occurrence. Massively fucked up red flag there. You should be way more concerned.", "That's really frequent. 2-3 times a month isn't that much, but every other day? That smacks of control issues, and when you combine it with her haranguing you for not doing things right, we're two red flags into Controlling Relationship territory."]}
