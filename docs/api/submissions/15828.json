We split the chores and I do most of the cooking, especially dinner. I don't really have a set time that I cook, it's pretty much whenever I get home and am able to. If I make things in one pot or without a protein there aren't usually issues except that she complains that she doesn't like how it tastes heated up. When I prepare a protein with it, its a whole other story.\n\nWhen I start cooking or tell her that dinner will be ready in 15-20 minutes she gets busy. She'll do things like take a long bath, go to the gym, go on a run, go down a few blocks to visit her parents, visit the neighbor, or start to snack. I've tried asking her many times if she doesn't like what I'm cooking or how I'm cooking it. I've tried asking her if there is a time she wants to eat, I've told her when I plan to start cooking and when she can expect it to be done. I get a whole lot of 'no' and that she likes my cooking but then she complains that the food is cold, or the meat/fish gets overcooked when she goes to warm it again, or if she nuked it in the microwave its rubbery.\n\nFor the last few weeks I've just stopped cooking her portion of protein. I'll make the sides, get her portion seasoned or dressed and she can just cook it when she's ready. It's been a bit of back and forth between us now and she cooks her portion while griping. Last night I was making us french bread pizzas. I had one prepped with toppings I like and one prepped with toppings she likes. I let her know I was going to put them in the oven, and off she went to her parents house. Okay. I waited to put hers in and after 30 minutes I just covered hers and put it in the fridge so she could bake it when she got home. When she did get home an hour later, she went to the kitchen and opened the oven and then the microwave and then asked where her pizza was. I told her it was in the fridge waiting on her to bake it. That started a fight and she accused me of trying to control when she eats. I told her yet again I couldn't care less when she eats, I care that I put time and effort into our meals only for her to complain its cold or ruined because she waited so long to eat it.

You're just supposed to then stop cooking until she comes back or is ready to eat? Cus that's what it sounds like.

This really shouldn\u2019t be a big deal, which isn\u2019t your fault. It\u2019s like getting a concert ticket and complaining that you missed it. \n\nMe or my gf cook when one of us is hungry. We usually just ask if the other is hungry, if so we make an extra portion.", "Jesus dump her ass man", "NTA", "Omg, your GF is such a pain in the ass. I mean either she is dumb as a rock or just doesn't give a shit about you and the effort you put in. Stop cooking anything for her if she continues pulling this shit.\n\nNTA", "NTA. What a whack job.", "NTA. She sounds entitled. And honestly why is she getting mad when YOU put the effort into cooking \ud83d\ude12", "NTA. She sounds like a miserable person. Is there something else about your relationship that's more positive? I guess this is just very weird to me because my husband and I always centered our relationship about our food, and if we were eating the same meal, we almost always ate together unless there was some complication that really prevented us from doing that. If we weren't going to eat at the same time, we would just prepare our respective meals separately. I can't imagine him expecting me to make him a meal that he wasn't going to eat when it was ready or vice versa. Honestly, it seems like a really odd arrangement. If she doesn't want to eat the food that you make, when you make it, then it seems like you should re-divide the chores and each make your own meals. Personally I wouldn't enjoy that but it sounds like it's how it works now anyway", "NTA. But your girlfriend is one.", "Does she maybe have an ED and might be uncomfortable eating around you? Anxious people can sometimes be nervous to eat around other esp with the stress of moving in with a partner. The complaining might be more dramatic bc she feels like him taking care of her food and feeding her is a love language. I can\u2019t eat w you but I can be as close as you making my food. Idk. She\u2019s still being a dick at the end of it. I\u2019m just trying to find explanations.", "NTA. Yeesh, why are you dating this incredibly tiresome person?", "NTA, my ex used to do crap like this. On at least one occasion, he walked into the kitchen AS I WAS PLATING DINNER to tell me not to bother making anything for him, he was going to the bar. I was infuriated.\n\nIf your schedule allows it, I would commit to having dinner on the table at the same time every evening. Tell her \"Dinner will be served at 6pm whether you are at the table or not. If it's cold or rubbery because you weren't at the table at 6, that's a you problem.\"", "NTA this is infuriating. I'd tell her if she wants to do something while I cook she can set the table. She can sit the fuck down after and wait for the food.", "     NTA- do you ever sit down to eat together? Your relationship sounds lonely.", "This is one of the more annoying things I\u2019ve read. She\u2019s being obnoxious as HELL. NTA", "I see you\u2019ve been asking her weird roundabout questions.  Have you asked her, specifically, why she wanders off as soon as you announce you\u2019ll be making dinner?  She\u2019s blatantly self-sabotaging here.\nDid she do this BEFORE you moved in together?  This is strange behavior, to intentionally pick activities that will cause her to be away when the food is ready.  She can\u2019t get busy\u2026cleaning dishes, or cleaning around the house, something that can stop when food is ready?", "Tell her to cook her own food.", "NTA", "NTA \nShe treats you like this because she can!\nThe worst about being in a bad relationship for say one year is being in a bad relationship for one year and a day, etc etc.  if she won't do couples therapy move on for both your sakes.", "Sounds like eating disorder", "NTA. Does she have a problem being in the room while you\u2019re eating? Or you seeing her eating? I can\u2019t imagine why else she\u2019d behave this way, unless she had an ED or misophobia or something that\u2019s triggered by food and you. You have so much patience though. I\u2019d have lost it.", "You are not her servant. She is selfish and ungrateful. You need someone who treats you right. You need a new GF.", "NTA. Why does she do things right when it\u2019s time to eat? That\u2019s so inconsiderate. I would stop cooking for her completely. It might even be a deal breaker for me, especially if she\u2019s inconsiderate with other things too.", "WTF? That\u2019s the absolute height of rudeness. Be damned if I\u2019d cook for someone that rude and ungrateful.", "NTA. I'm honestly not sure how you manage to remain calm and level-headed and not become petty and sarcastic. When you come to an impasse like this, it's really helpful to ask her what she thinks the solution is to the issue. This puts the onus on her to really think about the situation and put into words what she thinks is a reasonable solution.", "NTA by a long shot. Next time she whines about the food, tell her to go to Burger King where she can have it her way.", "NTA. Your an adult with dignity. She\u2019s acting ridiculous and blaming you. I don\u2019t know you, but you can do better", "NTA that is rude AF.  Does she cook ever?", "Maybe your cooking isn't good and she's trying to avoid it...?", "NTA\n\nThat's some major passive-aggressive shit she's pulling on you.\n\nStop cooking anything for her. She's a grown ass adult who doesn't appreciate your efforts to accommodate her insanity.\n\nETA: I'd  break up or at the very least, move out.", "NTA.\n\nI'd remind her that you tried to accommodate her on meals and that she always complains about how or when those meals are prepared.  I would point out that if how and when you prepare meals isn't to her liking, that she is welcome to take on household cooking, prepare her own meals or order takeout.\n\nOP, you shouldn't have to twist yourself into a Gumby-pretzel over this, only to listen to her complaining like Goldilocks.  Since she's a full-grown adult, let her deal with when, if, or what she eats.", "NTA\u2026. I would stop cooking for her all together. She has no respect for you or your time. You shouldn\u2019t have to cook twice or cook and reheat. When she complains just tell her you don\u2019t wanna cook twice. When she wants to eat with you, you will cook for her again\u2026", "NTA.  And your girlfriend is passive-aggressive and immature as hell.", "NTA \n\nWhy do you like this person?", "NTA, is so beautiful that a person cooks for you, I really can\u2019t understand why she decides to behave this way, after you\u2019re doing just a beautiful act of care. Hope you work thinks out, but she is being unreasonable", "Nta.  How was her behavior before you moved in together?", "She needs to pick a lane. She can\u2019t get mad about having to reheat the item AND having to cook it herself.", "I don't know if OPs sat his gf down and told her that he finds it disrespectful that he makes food for the both of them and she leaves. Like used those words exactly. Has this been discussed or is OP suffering in silence or just trying to hint at it? \n\nI had this conversation with my bf, although I didn't go anywhere I would just finish what I'm doing first which usually took 5-10 minutes. We solved the issue by him giving me a warning around 10 minutes before it's ready and me planning accordingly.\n\nIf she's being purposefully dense honestly I'd just switch out chores so she has to do the cooking. Though I wonder when she starts cooking does she then take up and leave, too?", "It\u2019s not worth it man. She\u2019s not going to change. Dump her", "It\u2019s like ordering your food at the restaurant then walking away from the table to go to the gym. Who does that? Nobody! OP gives the heads up that dinner is on the way, gf knows and then walks away.", "She sounds like Miranda Priestly from the  devil wears Prada. She had to have her coffee/breakfast like that and Anne Hathaway's character had to keep making it over and over so it'd be \"fresh\"", "well I was thinking that you could tell her you will start with dinner when she says she is ready and then wait to see how long she will take it. She may be playing games but it could be that she just isn't hungry until much later.", "I hope you realize how much it sounds like she's actively trying to find reasons to complain about you. This isn't healthy.", "That makes sense, but she needs to pick a chore she can easily stop doing, not \"I have 15 minutes so I'll run to the gym\".", "When my kids were young, I would tell them that I was serving dinner for next 20 minutes and they are welcome to join me and set a timer. I think I only had to throw food out twice before they caught on.", "This! It sounds like she never ever wants to eat with her boyfriend who cooks all her meals for her? So strange. Cooking/eating meals together is one of the best parts about living with your partner.", "That is some major mental gymnastics to get to that conclusion", "Maybe. Or maybe she's getting upset because to her she's \"almost always on time\" (remember every time she isn't is an exception, even if she's late every time) and the OP is forcing her to both deal with the fact that her perception is quite off and taking away her \"reward\" (a ready to eat meal) for doing whatever she put off until the dinner bell..", "I would continue handling it this way as well, and also rethink the relationship.\n\nIf she\u2019s this inconsiderate to you when you take the time to make dinner, what else is she going to be inconsiderate to you about?", "Took far too long to find this, you deserve more upvotes!   \nThis truly is a huge red flag.   \n\nNTA", "Seriously.  This is how toddlers behave.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Would that also account for her complaining when the food is reheated and also complaining when she needs to cook the protein herself? And would it account for her saying her BF was controlling what she ate when he tried to cater for her needs?? \n\nEveryone in the known universe has ADHD on Reddit.", "Oh fuck that, she knows she's regularly late and just doesn't care or, and this seems more likely, she's picking fights because she feels bad about it, but won't change her behavior.", "Yeah this guise of \u201ccontrolling when she eats\u201d is entirely fabricated. She controls when she eats by leaving when OP starts dinner. I\u2019d have a serious talk with her and stop cooking for her entirely but I fear it\u2019ll cause more problems. She can find a way to be upset about everything.", "This. It's a classic double bind; no matter what he does, OP will always be in the wrong and she will always punish him.", "My dude, she sounds exhausting.", "OH. Wait. Maybe\u2026 maybe this is a front for disordered eating? Sorry I\u2019m reaching but I can\u2019t make anything else make sense.", "Did you even read the post??", "Yeah, could be but then why complain about the food being cold? Wouldn\u2019t you try to draw as little attention to not eating together as possible. IDK people are just weird.", "I thought of that, too. Or, she's eating her mom's because she doesn't want to eat whst he's making and temperature/consistency crsb is because she's really not hungry.", "Like coming up with excuses not to eat much? Yeah man it\u2019s too weird lol"]}
