We split the chores and I do most of the cooking, especially dinner. I don't really have a set time that I cook, it's pretty much whenever I get home and am able to. If I make things in one pot or without a protein there aren't usually issues except that she complains that she doesn't like how it tastes heated up. When I prepare a protein with it, its a whole other story.\n\nWhen I start cooking or tell her that dinner will be ready in 15-20 minutes she gets busy. She'll do things like take a long bath, go to the gym, go on a run, go down a few blocks to visit her parents, visit the neighbor, or start to snack. I've tried asking her many times if she doesn't like what I'm cooking or how I'm cooking it. I've tried asking her if there is a time she wants to eat, I've told her when I plan to start cooking and when she can expect it to be done. I get a whole lot of 'no' and that she likes my cooking but then she complains that the food is cold, or the meat/fish gets overcooked when she goes to warm it again, or if she nuked it in the microwave its rubbery.\n\nFor the last few weeks I've just stopped cooking her portion of protein. I'll make the sides, get her portion seasoned or dressed and she can just cook it when she's ready. It's been a bit of back and forth between us now and she cooks her portion while griping. Last night I was making us french bread pizzas. I had one prepped with toppings I like and one prepped with toppings she likes. I let her know I was going to put them in the oven, and off she went to her parents house. Okay. I waited to put hers in and after 30 minutes I just covered hers and put it in the fridge so she could bake it when she got home. When she did get home an hour later, she went to the kitchen and opened the oven and then the microwave and then asked where her pizza was. I told her it was in the fridge waiting on her to bake it. That started a fight and she accused me of trying to control when she eats. I told her yet again I couldn't care less when she eats, I care that I put time and effort into our meals only for her to complain its cold or ruined because she waited so long to eat it.

Your girlfriend sounds annoying as shit. I would continue handling it the same way you are.", "NTA - That would be annoying AF and I think you found a nice simple solution. Also, how is putting her portion in the fridge controlling when she eats? This literally means she can eat when she wants to. Pretty soon you might want to ask yourself if you want to deal with this kind of junk for the rest of your life.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is hugely disrespectful of your time and effort. It\u2019s wildly bizarre that she\u2019d leave the house when you\u2019re cooking dinner. You are not at her beck and call; the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her weird personal schedule. \n\nStop making any food for her. If she can\u2019t respect your effort, then she can make her own meal altogether. \n\nIt\u2019s like a bizarre power play where she\u2019s testing to see if you can read her mind on when she\u2019ll be ready to eat.", "NTA. Seems like there has to be something else going on here- she leaves when you tell her when dinner will be ready, and then\u2026 complains that dinner isn\u2019t ready when she gets home? This isn\u2019t logical- there just has to be something else going on here, and honestly it sounds like she needs therapy. Her relationship with food isn\u2019t healthy.", "Info: Does she have an eating disorder?", "I would document the times and make her sit down with me and go through what things look like from your perspective. Like\n\n\u201c6:00- started making dinner, informed you it would be ready in 20 minutes, you acknowledged that you heard me.\n\n6:10- you left for your parents\u2019 house, no indication of when you\u2019d be back.\n\n6:20- dinner ready.\n\n7:10- you return home, complain dinner is not ready/was overdone\u2026 I ate 50 minutes ago.\u201d\n\nShe is either avoiding eating, avoiding you, completely clueless about the disrespect this shows, or trying to undermine your self esteem and gaslight you into thinking you never prepare food properly. Ask her which one it is and depending on the answer either tackle the problem together or break up.", "NTA She is showing a total lack of respect and appreciation for you and your efforts by going off and doing things after you've let her know the food will be ready soon. You've done your part, and she has no basis to complain when she is the one who chooses not to eat the food right when it's ready. \n\nYou should refuse to cook anything for her unless she agrees to eat with you right when the food is ready. If not, she can fend for herself if she prefers mealtime anarchy. \n\nThis is a big red flag for your relationship. She is dismissive of your efforts and ignoring you when you want to eat meals together. She is showing that she doesn't take you or your relationship seriously. Don't tolerate this rude behavior.  If she wants to eat by herself whenever she wants maybe she would prefer being single in her own place while you would prefer a GF who treats you with respect.", "NTA. Your GF needs to grow up, seriously.", "I would  leave it in the oven. I would leave it in the oven till the damned smoke alarm goes off. You told her when the pizza was going to be ready, *and then she left the house*! How long does it *take* for french bread pizza-fifteen, maybe twenty minutes? She couldn\u2019t *not* go to her parents house down the street till she ate?\n\nShe can come home to a loaf of charcoal and I would be *done* cooking  for her.\n\nI hope she is pretty. NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re already making the dinner, the least she could do is have the decency to sit down and appreciate it. If she doesn\u2019t like it, she could cook. Is she just avoiding eating dinner with you? There could be some deeper reasons as to why this is the case (e.g does she have an eating disorder?). If you\u2019re not sure, ask her, communication is key. If there aren\u2019t, she\u2019s just being ungrateful and rude and needs to grow up.", "NTA. My wife does something similar. It's really annoying. She'll ask for some of what I'm making, I get her a good portion and 1+ hours later it's still not eaten and she gets mad at me for reminding her to eat it. I haven't found a solution yet :(", "You've tried multiple compromises, and everything You've tried is meant with complaints. She complains if it gets cold, she complains if it has to be reheated, she complains if she has to finish cooking it. Apparently she's expecting food to be magically hot at the exact moment she decides to eat, which is childish and weird. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend sounds insufferable. I would stop cooking for her at all.", "Man, you\u2019re really trying to accommodate her and she\u2019s acting like you\u2019re not running your restaurant properly. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou've tried just about every way to please her with the cooking. What is her solution?", "NTA she's grown let her cook for herself.", "NTA\n\n\nI love to cook. This kind of behavior would be potentially deal breaking for me.", "NTA.\n\nYou are her partner, not a personal butler.\n\nYou sound more than accommodating to her and it does seem like she appreciates it at all. \n\nPick a stable time block where you\u2019d be able to cook every day like 5-6pm for example. Make dinner as you have been and if she doesn\u2019t prioritize eating the meal with you she can figure it out herself. \n\nShe sounds very disrespectful", "Nope nta, food actually represents time, mental and physical input. If people dont show up on time or atleast try to or dont consume it on a regular basis then they are showing you disrespect. And as you pointed out its a pattern with your gf so something is going on for sure.", "Nta, I agree your not control when she eats, but she can start cooking for herself, instead acting a entitled jerk towards you.", "NTA. She's being an unreasonable child. Who the hell hears \"I'm cooking dinner\" and then proceeds to leave the house??? She has no respect for you or your time. You're not controlling what or when she eats, you're trying to avoid complaints about reheated food, which she wouldn't need to reheat if she stopped fn off... You're doing exactly right. If you cook and she leaves, her portion goes away to be eaten when she gets back. What does she expect you to do? You say \"I'm cooking dinner\" so she fs off, and what... You're just supposed to then stop cooking until she comes back or is ready to eat? Cus that's what it sounds like. But I guarantee if you did that, she would start crying about why isn't dinner ready?? She's starving!!\nI'm sorry bud but this is a no win situation for you. Keep up what your doing or you can just not cook for her at all. You can try to communicate with her these issues, but I sincerely doubt that she will care. It sounds like you'll always be the bad guy here. And I'm so sorry", "NTA- It sounds like you have made a reasonable effort to communicate with your girlfriend about meal times and preparation, and you have taken steps to accommodate her preferences by letting her cook her own protein when you make meals that may not reheat well. You are not responsible for her decision to engage in other activities while you are preparing a meal, nor are you controlling her eating habits by offering her the option to cook her own portion.\r  \n\r  \nIt's understandable that you feel frustrated and unappreciated when you put effort into cooking meals that are not enjoyed or appreciated. Ultimately, you are not in the wrong for making changes to the way you prepare meals if you feel it is necessary to avoid conflict and ensure that your efforts are appreciated.", "I totally don't understand you making dinner for you both and not eating together as a couple.  That is weird.  If it were me I would stop.  There is no way I would make dinner for us both and have my partner fiddle fuck around and eat whenever they wanted.  If I'm cooking, we eat together (of course I'm assuming we work the same shifts etc etc).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Long ago, I read a post where a host cooks a full meal and brings the 3-5 course meal to the table and THEN goes to pray for 15-30 mins, after which she'll join the dinner. All this time the guests (incl children) have to wait and watch the food go cold while the host prays. The host will say \"go ahead and eat\" before she goes to pray tho. This was going on for a long time.\n\n So, OP of that post decided to eat because she was hungry that day. Remember the host always says \"start without me\" before she fucks off. But once the host sees OP had started eating she threw a fit and made snide remarks.\n\nYour post reminded me of that one. I think this is about control. If she's running off to do some unrelated shit every time you mentioned cooking, then it's very intentional.\n\nNTA.

If it's going out to eat, there's no issue. Some of it is she'll snack right when I say I'm cooking, and be too full, and then go back to reheat what I made an hour or so later so she's not avoiding food.

Is there anything else in your relationship where you feel like you can just never get things right?
