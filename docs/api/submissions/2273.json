Obviously, she has an idea of what she wants you to wear but it doesn't make you feel good or match what you want.  At your age, you should have the ability to make clothing decisions.\n\nGood luck shopping.", "NTA and it's your dance not your mother's, as well as your body being clothed. She should have taken your opinion to heart and returned the dress.", "NTA.  You didn't ask her to spend that much money without your input.  If she's disappointed, maybe next time she can actually involve you in the decision-making process, or at least pay attention and recalibrate her plans and/or expectations the first time you warn her this is not going to end up being the picture-perfect moment she dreamed up in her head starring her imaginary version of you with no actual opinions or preferences of its own.", "NTA. Part of the fun of formal is actually shopping for the dress you want. Your mum is being very weird and pushy about this. \n\nFormal dresses can be quite expensive (the ones my daughter has shown me are between $300 - 500). Is it possible that there is a financial issue, and she actually got this dress very cheap or free and is trying to present this dress to avoid telling you that she cannot afford anything else? \nOtherwise it seems like she is trying to live vicariously through you. Does she normally do things like this? Or is this out of the ordinary? \n\nWhatever the issue, you should be allowed to find your own dress. If money is an issue, check out facebook marketplace and Gumtree. There are a lot of people oit there selling secondhand formal dress for cheap, and sometimes even giving them away for free. I know where I live we also have a 'community store' during term 4, where people donate their old formal clothes, so that students can go and find something for free. \n\nI still have my year 12 formal dress 22+ years later. My daughter has worn it for a couple of weddings and such in the past few years. She has already started looking for a formal dress for herself for next year.\n\nGood luck with the dress shopping.", "NTA. You have tried to express your feelings kindly and acknowledged the generosity of your mother. But you are ok to find something you feel nice and confident in. It\u2019s not your mom\u2019s party, it\u2019s yours.", "NTA. She shouldn't have bought the dress without consulting you first.", "It isn\u2019t your fault that she spent that kind of money, that was her choice. And one she didn\u2019t consult you on. You\u2019re not a doll to be dressed as she sees fit. Formal is your night to celebrate your school career and mark the beginning of a new chapter in your life, you should be able to do that with confidence and agency. \n\nBuy yourself a dress you\u2019ll love and enjoy your night. NTA", "NTA No one wants a dress that their mom randomly picked out.\n\nThis situation is weird and it kinda sounds like she set you up to pick a fight with her.", "NTA\n\nYou are old enough to dress yourself.", "NTA I hope you can get a dress that you are happy with.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ask for the dress and you don\u2019t want the dress. People who get upset about things like that are usually manipulative and toxic. If standing up for yourself and insisting that you won\u2019t wear the dress will be a nightmare, one of the following might help:\n\nA. Offer to take some pre-prom photos in the dress she picked, then change into the dress you eventually pick out. You\u2019ll hate those photos but whatever.\n\nIf she\u2019s really a jerk and this compromise would also make things worse,\n\nB. Leave the house in the dress she picked and then stop somewhere along the way and change into the dress of your choice and hope that she doesn\u2019t figure it out afterwards. Or if she does maybe at least the fallout after the event is less stress than dealing with it before the event.", "Nta.  Her dream is not your dream.", "NTA. Possibly N A H but mum's sounding like she's digging her heels in.\n\nMy mum did the same for me for year 10 formal nearly 20 years ago (yikes), and I felt so guilty about her disappointment that I wore it. I was uncomfortable all night and still get uncomfortable looking at those photos now. \n\nIt's taken me those almost 20 years to learn this, but you don't have to shrink to let your parents be tall, and you are not responsible for their feelings. You can be you and be kind all at once. Sometimes it takes our parents a little while to realise that a rejection of their choices or opinions is not a rejection of them :). \n\nUnfortunately, your mum picked out and got attached to something that isn't right for you. If this isn't a regular power play type occurrence from her, this is probably a good opportunity to discuss how you feel, explain to her that you so appreciate the thought and you can see why she loves the dress, but you have x, x, and x insecurities, and while you're trying to work through that, this dress highlights them in a way that makes you truly uncomfortable. I'm sorry if she's unable to hear you. \n\nAs far as money, yes, $120 is expensive for me, too, especially at the moment. However, if one of you still has the receipt, there aren't a lot of shops in that general price bracket that won't allow you to return or at least exchange. I'm sure, if you're able to return it, you'll find quite a range of nice dresses in that price range that are more suitable.\n\nOr, if mum doesn't come to the discussion, consider returning it, returning her money with genuine thanks, and using either one of these formal dress exchanges others have mentioned, or heading out to the second hand shops (the warehouses are usually less expensive than the small shop fronts). \n\nI wish you all the best with your mum, your dress, and your formal!", "NAH.\n\nI think it's entirely reasonable to want to choose your own outfit for an event like this, and from this information, entirely reasonable to go out and get a different dress.\n\nI think your mother genuinely thought she was doing a nice thing and is upset that it's not making you happy. I think she made a mistake by getting attached to the dress before giving it to you. The fact that it's expensive doesn't change the fact that you didn't even get a chance to try it on first to see whether it fit well. The fact that she meant well doesn't change the fact that you had wanted something very different.\n\nFrom what you've said here, if this isn't part of a larger pattern, this sounds like more of a sad misunderstanding than a situation where either of you did anything egregiously wrong. But if she keeps on holding a grudge, I'm closer to N T A.\n\nEDIT: missed a bit in the OP and edited to reflect that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
