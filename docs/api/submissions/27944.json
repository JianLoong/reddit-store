She arrives in the morning when I leave for work (8am) and leaves when me or my husband gets home (5-6pm). She's been quite good with the kids which is fine, but the only problem is she's making herself at home too much in my opinion.\n\nThe first problem is that she'll randomly leave things at our place overnight, such as a coat or a car seat or something like that. She'll also sometimes put small bits of food in our fridge and leave it there overnight when she's coming the next day.\n\nBut what irks me the most is the dogs. She has two dogs, one is a chocolate labrador and the other is a great dane. I really don't like dogs, originally I said she couldn't bring them with her when she asked. One day she \"had to\" bring them because her garden was being landscaped, so I let her, but told her to keep them outside. Well, since then she's just kept bringing them. I didn't say anything since it wasn't really that big of a deal and not worth the hassle.\n\nIncrementally she's letting them get away with more and more. She first was tying them up to the fence, then she started letting them run free in the yard. Then one time it was raining and she called me asking if it was ok for them to come in the house for a bit and just stay in the kitchen. And now they're just let free reign.\n\nIt's in terms of the dogs that I'm really feeling she's just making herself too much at home. I'll find random chewed up tennis balls in the yard, and she's set up a couple of metal bowls near the back door. The other day I found a bag of dog treats in the pantry that I'm assuming are hers. Probably the worst of all is that she obviously takes them out to do their business (I don't even want to think about all the dog doo-doo that would be in my yard) and bags the poop. But then she leaves the poop by the front door next to her handbag and dog leashes. So I normally come home to a few of these bright green bags of her dog doo-doo at my front door. It's just so gross.\n\nI want to say something to her, but my husband is telling me not to. He's saying that we need her to look after the kids, and that it'd come across as offensive to tell her that. He said its just minor things and to not really worry about it, we only need her until the kids are school age anyway. He's quite serious and we've been arguing over it quite a bit.\n\nWIBTA for telling her to stop making herself so much at home? I feel like she's just done it bit-by-bit so we didn't really notice, but looking back she's basically starting to slot into the household.\n\nEdit: should be WIBTA instead of AITA", "created_utc": 1696091066, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wb3zv/aita_for_asking_our_nanny_to_stop_making_herself/", "score": 813, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's look at this in terms of regular workplace etiquette. All workplaces would let you leave a jacket in your work area or a small amount of food in the fridge, so those are reasonable accommodations. Would an office allow dogs when it's been previously communicated that dogs aren't allowed? No. Making herself comfortable is not a big deal but bringing dogs is a no. You need to communicate that to her.", "nta, but reset the boundaries. Although I don't see an issue with leaving food in the fridge if she's working there the next day (unless it's stinky food) but that's just me.", "NTA for wanting to discuss the dogs. Two big dogs in your yard everyday is a big ask. Especially when it has no relevance to her employment. She perhaps thinks your fine with them being there, but if you aren\u2019t you should let her know. \n\nYWBTA for raising the occasional coat or food being left overnight. Perhaps she is just forgetting. Or thinking it\u2019s more convenient.

Phrase it as it is- you take issue with the dogs. Remind her that you only allowed them to come while her yard was being redone, but now that it\u2019s done, the dogs are no longer welcome. \n\nThe occasional forgetting of a coat is not a big deal. If the food is truly a big deal then mention it. But, since the dogs seem to be your main issue, stick to that. YWNBTA if you told her to stop bringing the dogs but you would if you asked her to \u201cstop making herself so at home.\u201d", "NTA. But I don\u2019t think you even need to say anything about making herself too at home, just let her know the dogs are becoming too much and you\u2019d like her to keep them at home. She\u2019s an employee, albeit a different kind of employee but most people don\u2019t get to bring their pets to work.", "YWNBTA for addressing the dog situation. Not saying anything and letting it go was a mistake.\n\nLeave the other things out, though. Leaving a coat or a food item in the fridge overnight isn't a big deal.", "ESH - First of all, you need to establish that the dogs are not allowed at your home.  And yes, the backyard counts as your home. Apologize for not communicating this to her more clearly.  You should have said something the first time.  You need to communicate clearly with her.  To her, not hearing no is the same as hearing yes.  That's not great, but if it's how she is, you need to be more direct and clear with your communication.  Tell her that you're not comfortable having animals at your home.   Do not offer exceptions. Don't say \"no dogs unless there's an emergency.\"  No dogs period.  You don't need a reason.  If you give a reason, she can find a way around the reason.\n\nSecondly, work out this issue about leaving stuff.  When she leaves something, you can text her right after she leaves.  \"Hey, you forgot your jacket here.  I'm going to hang it by the door.\"  Text her every single time she leaves something there.  As if she forgot.  See if that makes a difference.   Another thing you could do is give her a small spot in the home to leave some stuff.  No harm in that as long as you have the space.  Anything she leaves needs to fit in that space.  No leaving stuff in other places around the house.\n\nShe needs to stop assuming that she can do these things.   She needs to check with you.  She needs to clean up after herself and her dogs.\n\nYou need to communicate what your expectations are.   You are her employer, but you are giving her no guidelines.  Still you're expecting her to follow your expectations.\n\nY'all need to communicate.\n\nEdit: I wanted to share a thing I've learned about boundaries.  A boundary is not a one-time statement, a one-time decision.  You must maintain and assert your boundaries.  When a boundary is crossed, you must address it.  Otherwise the boundary is gone.  It doesn't exist anymore.  It sucks that this is the way it is.  Ideally everyone would respect a person's original boundaries in the long term.  That's not how it works in reality. \n\nHere's what happened with the dogs.  You stated your boundary, ***no dogs***.  There was an emergency, she had to bring the dogs.  You didn't assert your boundary (By saying, this was a one time thing).  So now the new boundary is ***no dogs unless it's an emergency, and only outside.***  She brings them a couple more times for what she thinks are emergencies.  Now the boundary is ***dogs are always ok outside, but never in the house.***   When you saw this was happening, you didn't assert your original boundary.  You allowed it to continue.  Then it rained, now the new boundary is ***dogs are allowed in the kitchen during the rain.***  You didn't tell her this was a one time thing.  She pushed the boundary a little farther.  Now the rule is ***dogs are always allowed in the kitchen.***  You didn't set her straight, she pushed it a little further.  Now the boundary is ***dogs are always allowed everywhere in the home and yard.  Their poop is allowed everywhere, their stuff is allowed everywhere.***   \n\nI am not going to give you a hard time for failing to assert these boundaries.  The nanny should have respected your original boundary.  However you must learn how to maintain your boundaries.  Not only in this situation, but in all parts of life.  Your standards matter.  Your boundaries are important.  This is your home and your responsibility.  If something isn't ok, you must address it.  People will often push your boundaries if you let them.  You have to be clear that the boundary stands.  The boundary does not move.", "YTA if you tell her to stop making herself at home. N TA if you remind her the dogs coming over was a one time deal and they need to stay home now. Leaving lunch in the fridge for the next day isn\u2019t a big deal. Leaving the car seat for your child at your house shouldn\u2019t be a big deal either. But the dogs can be left at home easily. You just need to kindly remind her that the dogs coming over was a one time deal.", "YWNBTA for bringing up the dogs and ONLY the dogs. \n\nThe coat and some food for herself is not a big deal. I believe you're irritated because you're already very irritated about the dogs, so everything else just feels like a pile on of more annoyances. People can be forgetful and leave a coat. It does not mean they're making themselves at home. I have left coats or something at a friend's house. I am not making myself at home. As for the food, if it's oat milk or something you don't have, I think she's trying to provide something for herself to have throughout the day when she's taking care of YOUR kids. Also, is it seriously that big of a deal to have food for herself when she's minding your kids? My friend used to nanny for people and they would tell her to feel free to have whatever is in the fridge. If you feel like she must always take everything home and \"leave no trace\" like she's camping, you sound very difficult and not hospitable to an employee. \n\nThe issue here is the dogs. You allowed it once due to work going on at her home. Once. She took it as an invitation to do it regularly now. I think it's absolutely appropriate to tell an employee working full time that they can't bring their dogs to work. Most people wouldn't dream of doing it like she has. She took ONE DAY'S EXCEPTION and gave herself permission to do it frequently. \n\nAlso, I own a dog. I don't let my dog shit on my friend's, much less employer's, lawn unless they have dogs that they allow that on. Otherwise, I walk my dog elsewhere. You don't sound like you have dogs so you have a shit free lawn (assuming it's fenced) and you shouldn't have to worry about your kids playing with shit stained grass bits. \n\nAlso, her leaving dog treats or toys behind is a sign she is DEFINITELY getting too comfortable and thinks she can have her cake and eat it too. It's many people's dream to bring their pets to work. Leaving treats at your home in the pantry is her very obvious understanding that she can bring the dogs to work and to give them treats at work and it's A-OK.\n\nAny reasonable employee would understand if you tell them to stop bringing the dogs. If she doesn't get it, she sounds young and inexperienced. My WARNING is that if you tell her this, she might quit and you're left without a nanny.", "YWBTA \u2014 if you say stop making yourself at home. Seems like the only intrusive thing here is the dogs. \n\nYou would not be the ah to tell her the dogs are no longer allowed.\n\nIt is not easy to find good child care \u2026. Pick your battles wisely.", "I'm with you on the dog thing, and I think it's fine to tell her that you thought that her bringing them in was a one-time thing.\n\nBut your other gripes make me feel like you might not be the most understanding employer. She works 9 or 10 hours a day at your house and you're annoyed she might leave a coat or some food there? Come on now.", "INFO: What is your Plan B if she decides to take different work? You and your husband disagree about this issue. So far, this would be a N-A-H situation since you're showing good communication. However, you're indicating that you might veto your husband and talk to her anyway, despite his objection. So what happens if the talk goes badly and she decides she doesn't want to work for you anymore?", "YTA, specifically if you're upset that she leaves food for herself in your fridge because she's coming the next day. The least you could do is spare a bit of room in your fridge, that would be a kindness. My mom lets her caregivers leave food in her fridge when they work a couple days in a row. It's not a bad thing that your nanny does this.\n\nAs far as the dogs go, NTA.", "ESH\n\nShe's an AH because you gave her an inch and she took a marathon's worth of miles. She is taking advantage of you, and it's completely inappropriate as an employee.\n\nYou're an AH for two reasons: 1) you're conflating very minor, normal things like her keeping a small snack in your fridge or leaving/forgetting an item of clothing at your house overnight with incredibly inappropriate behaviours like having her pets run amok on your property. Those are not even comparable, so stop comparing them. As someone who works in your house regularly, you should be *reasonably accommodating* to her. Leaving a small amount of food in your refrigerator or leaving her coat there is not inappropriately \"making herself at home\" - it's something people do at their workplaces. You could use a bit of flexibility.\n\nBut 2) you're also an AH because you should have said something within a few days of her continuing to bring her dogs to your home after what was clearly stated to her as a one-time exception. As the employer, it is up to you to set boundaries and enforce them. Her behaviour is unacceptable, but you're her boss . . . it's literally your responsibility to let her know that. And if you don't, while it's possible to say that she \"should have known\", it's also possible for her to say that she thought your rules had become more flexible. Until you use your grownup words, it remains unclear. And now you've allowed it to go on for . . . weeks? Months? She can't read your mind. Your husband is wrong. It's your home, and it is not one where pets are welcome. You are absolutely meant to tell her that. \n\nESH.

Unfortunately, once they get in the habit of doing something you disagree with, you can't put the genie back in the bottle.

She\u2019s not putting the poo bags in your trash and making your house smell. She\u2019s taking it with her. I assume the car seat is something she uses for your kids in her vehicle? An occasionally forgotten coat is not a big deal. Employees in most places have a break room. She\u2019s a person existing in the space you live to doing work that you hired her for. If you want to constrain her visible presence so you don\u2019t see signs of her existence, get her a mini fridge and put it into a space that she has designated for all these things that you take umbrage with. Like a closet in a hotel room, including a lockbox. Put a sealing diaper bucket near the door and line it with a scented bag so she has something to hide those poo bags in and is a way of you having a touch of control in how she exists in your family\u2019s house. My guess though, is that she spends more time in your house than you do, that the kids are attached to her in a way you wish you could be there for them, that the kids love the dogs and the dogs love them. She literally is a part of your household, a person, not something like a vacuum that you can shut in a closet and not acknowledge its existence when you aren\u2019t using it.

You sound like a territorial teenager. You do realize she's a person, not just an object there to assist you right? Normal work places would allow these things. \n\nNot wanting the dogs there and asking her to respect that boundary is 100% not AH territory. Getting uppity about a jacket and food in the fridge (normal workplace behaviour) is definitely AH territory. So many people would be moved to tears with gratitude to be fortunate enough to be able to hire a nanny, and here you are complaining that she's acting like a person.", "NTA & YTA\nI think your being petty about most of it. But the dogs....I have 2 myself,  however she should not be bringing them if you do not want her to. I'd nip it in the bud asap. It's unprofessional.  BTW how old is she?

This is a hard one for you.", "There is a lot of excellent advice posted here. The common thread is that you let her shift the boundaries of your comfort zone but not speaking up earlier. She can\u2019t read your mind. Take this a lesson to be more direct with people and communicate your stance. It would have been *way* easier to nip this in the bud then it will be to talk to her now. You\u2019ll have to chose your words carefully because the first thing she\u2019ll say is, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you say anything before\u201d? \n\nAlso, don\u2019t take the easy way out and pan this off on your husband - this is your problem to deal with.", "While I don't think her leaving food there is a big deal at all.

As long as she isn\u2019t taking up a lot of space and isn\u2019t doing things like microwaving seafood, I don\u2019t really see a problem. However it is inappropriate for her to be bringing the dogs at all. It\u2019s your home and you have a right to not have animals in it. As you\u2019ve said, you don\u2019t like dogs. So she should not be bringing dogs. Furthermore I would assume that your house isn\u2019t equipped to be dealing with pets on a regular basis. Sorry if I\u2019m speaking out of turn (I have never owned a dog) but I would assume that it would be really easy for her dogs to make a mess of your house/garden if for example you have more fragile decor or if you don\u2019t keep food out of reach because you\u2019re not used to having to worry about a dog getting into things. Not to mention if there are plants in the home that are toxic to dogs, etc. That comes off as entitled on her part.

I'm a dog owner and I absolutely love my dog BUT I'm always cautious when my daughter (which is 4) interacts with our dog (which has been with me way before my daughter was born), my dog has never bitten anyone and is pretty loving BUT it is still a dog, animals can get annoyed, specially when children mishandle them, and their reactions are animal reactions. I do this even knowing my dog and talking about a small breed. A Great Dane is no joke, if it gets annoyed it could end bad, even if it is just \"establishing boundaries\" as dogs do, forget the bags of shit that would be my main concerne.\n\nI may be wrong and they might as well be the most loving and well behave dogs in the world but that would be an absolute no no for me, specially when you are not the owner and hence don't know how they react.", "NTA as she sounds like the kind of person who will push and push and push. I didn\u2019t think the first pieces are a big deal but the dogs are a boundary I think it\u2019s fair to lay out and clearly get back to your original expectations.

I would tell her that her dogs are no longer welcome, so please don't bring them to your home anymore, effective immediately.\n\nIf she wants to quit over this, I think it's probably best because she is telling you her priority is her dogs, not your children, when she is getting paid to take care of your kids.", "I see that others gave very good arguments about why you should stop allowing her to bring her dogs. That is very clear cut, I think, and the baggies of doggy doo are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY out of bounds, but I wanted to speak to the smaller issue of the jacket, etc. If you allow her to leave her jacket, her lunch, her this, her that, then every time you notice something that isn't yours in your home, there will be a little uncertainty: does this belong to the nanny? Can I throw it out or should I ask her about it? Even if it's just a jacket, what if she leaves her expensive jacket in your house and it disappears? Will she accuse one of your guests of stealing it? Ruining it? I think think it creates uncertainty for you that is uncomfortable. Also, as you (OP) point out, this is her workplace so she should not treat it like her home, and not only is it not her home, it's someone else's home! She's an employee, not a roommate or a houseguest. \n\nThe baggies of doggy doo are way out of bounds. Your husband is being a bit too much of a softie here, I think. I understand his viewpoint but bottom line if you have this kind of stress in your own home, then the nanny is not really doing what a nanny is supposed to do, which is to make your life easier. That's usually why people pay the higher cost of a nanny instead of sending kids to a daycare. I think if you as the employer don't set and maintain good boundaries, it tends to lead to the employee losing respect for the employer and the breakdown of the relationship. She's treating you like a buddy, or like she's doing you a favor, rather than her employer. \n\nThe exception is the carseat. Assuming this carseat is used to transport your children, I would argue that it belongs in your home when it's not in use. It's for your benefit, you should be the one to store it.

An easy way to deal with these things is to provide her a designated space for items in the fridge or pantry, and a coat hook.  After all, she spends a significant amount of time in your home on a daily basis and she should have comfortable accommodations for her belongings and food.

No one asked, they just show up with animals.  \n\nWe don't do this anymore.  I had to have a discussion with the agency.  When people bring their pet one time ostensibly \"for the client to see them\", they will continue to push this boundary.  In the past couple months, we've had two new caregivers try to bring their dogs regularly, including one who wanted her dog in the home with her for upwards of 40 hours a week.  No.  Just no.

She said the client wanted to hang out with the dog.  She asked if that was ok.  I said no, I don't feel comfortable with that.   She left the dog anyways.  My poor client ended up having a meltdown later trying to provide care for this dog.
