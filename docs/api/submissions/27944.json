{"id": 27944, "submission_id": "16wb3zv", "title": "AITA for asking our nanny to stop making herself at home in our house?", "selftext": "We have a nanny who comes to look after my little ones (age 2 and 4) three times a week. She arrives in the morning when I leave for work (8am) and leaves when me or my husband gets home (5-6pm). She's been quite good with the kids which is fine, but the only problem is she's making herself at home too much in my opinion.\n\nThe first problem is that she'll randomly leave things at our place overnight, such as a coat or a car seat or something like that. She'll also sometimes put small bits of food in our fridge and leave it there overnight when she's coming the next day.\n\nBut what irks me the most is the dogs. She has two dogs, one is a chocolate labrador and the other is a great dane. I really don't like dogs, originally I said she couldn't bring them with her when she asked. One day she \"had to\" bring them because her garden was being landscaped, so I let her, but told her to keep them outside. Well, since then she's just kept bringing them. I didn't say anything since it wasn't really that big of a deal and not worth the hassle.\n\nIncrementally she's letting them get away with more and more. She first was tying them up to the fence, then she started letting them run free in the yard. Then one time it was raining and she called me asking if it was ok for them to come in the house for a bit and just stay in the kitchen. And now they're just let free reign.\n\nIt's in terms of the dogs that I'm really feeling she's just making herself too much at home. I'll find random chewed up tennis balls in the yard, and she's set up a couple of metal bowls near the back door. The other day I found a bag of dog treats in the pantry that I'm assuming are hers. Probably the worst of all is that she obviously takes them out to do their business (I don't even want to think about all the dog doo-doo that would be in my yard) and bags the poop. But then she leaves the poop by the front door next to her handbag and dog leashes. So I normally come home to a few of these bright green bags of her dog doo-doo at my front door. It's just so gross.\n\nI want to say something to her, but my husband is telling me not to. He's saying that we need her to look after the kids, and that it'd come across as offensive to tell her that. He said its just minor things and to not really worry about it, we only need her until the kids are school age anyway. He's quite serious and we've been arguing over it quite a bit.\n\nWIBTA for telling her to stop making herself so much at home? I feel like she's just done it bit-by-bit so we didn't really notice, but looking back she's basically starting to slot into the household.\n\nEdit: should be WIBTA instead of AITA", "created_utc": 1696091066, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wb3zv/aita_for_asking_our_nanny_to_stop_making_herself/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's look at this in terms of regular workplace etiquette. All workplaces would let you leave a jacket in your work area or a small amount of food in the fridge, so those are reasonable accommodations. Would an office allow dogs when it's been previously communicated that dogs aren't allowed? No. Making herself comfortable is not a big deal but bringing dogs is a no. You need to communicate that to her.", "nta, but reset the boundaries. Although I don't see an issue with leaving food in the fridge if she's working there the next day (unless it's stinky food) but that's just me.", "NTA for wanting to discuss the dogs. Two big dogs in your yard everyday is a big ask. Especially when it has no relevance to her employment. She perhaps thinks your fine with them being there, but if you aren\u2019t you should let her know. \n\nYWBTA for raising the occasional coat or food being left overnight. Perhaps she is just forgetting. Or thinking it\u2019s more convenient.

Phrase it as it is- you take issue with the dogs. Remind her that you only allowed them to come while her yard was being redone, but now that it\u2019s done, the dogs are no longer welcome. \n\nThe occasional forgetting of a coat is not a big deal. If the food is truly a big deal then mention it. But, since the dogs seem to be your main issue, stick to that. YWNBTA if you told her to stop bringing the dogs but you would if you asked her to \u201cstop making herself so at home.\u201d", "NTA. But I don\u2019t think you even need to say anything about making herself too at home, just let her know the dogs are becoming too much and you\u2019d like her to keep them at home. She\u2019s an employee, albeit a different kind of employee but most people don\u2019t get to bring their pets to work.", "YWNBTA for addressing the dog situation. Not saying anything and letting it go was a mistake.\n\nLeave the other things out, though. Leaving a coat or a food item in the fridge overnight isn't a big deal.", "ESH - First of all, you need to establish that the dogs are not allowed at your home.  And yes, the backyard counts as your home. Apologize for not communicating this to her more clearly.  You should have said something the first time.  You need to communicate clearly with her.  To her, not hearing no is the same as hearing yes.  That's not great, but if it's how she is, you need to be more direct and clear with your communication.  Tell her that you're not comfortable having animals at your home.   Do not offer exceptions. Don't say \"no dogs unless there's an emergency.\"  No dogs period.  You don't need a reason.  If you give a reason, she can find a way around the reason.\n\nSecondly, work out this issue about leaving stuff.  When she leaves something, you can text her right after she leaves.  \"Hey, you forgot your jacket here.  I'm going to hang it by the door.\"  Text her every single time she leaves something there.  As if she forgot.  See if that makes a difference.   Another thing you could do is give her a small spot in the home to leave some stuff.  No harm in that as long as you have the space.  Anything she leaves needs to fit in that space.  No leaving stuff in other places around the house.\n\nShe needs to stop assuming that she can do these things.   She needs to check with you.  She needs to clean up after herself and her dogs.\n\nYou need to communicate what your expectations are.   You are her employer, but you are giving her no guidelines.  Still you're expecting her to follow your expectations.\n\nY'all need to communicate.\n\nEdit: I wanted to share a thing I've learned about boundaries.  A boundary is not a one-time statement, a one-time decision.  You must maintain and assert your boundaries.  When a boundary is crossed, you must address it.  Otherwise the boundary is gone.  It doesn't exist anymore.  It sucks that this is the way it is.  Ideally everyone would respect a person's original boundaries in the long term.  That's not how it works in reality. \n\nHere's what happened with the dogs.  You stated your boundary, ***no dogs***.  There was an emergency, she had to bring the dogs.  You didn't assert your boundary (By saying, this was a one time thing).  So now the new boundary is ***no dogs unless it's an emergency, and only outside.***  She brings them a couple more times for what she thinks are emergencies.  Now the boundary is ***dogs are always ok outside, but never in the house.***   When you saw this was happening, you didn't assert your original boundary.  You allowed it to continue.  Then it rained, now the new boundary is ***dogs are allowed in the kitchen during the rain.***  You didn't tell her this was a one time thing.  She pushed the boundary a little farther.  Now the rule is ***dogs are always allowed in the kitchen.***  You didn't set her straight, she pushed it a little further.  Now the boundary is ***dogs are always allowed everywhere in the home and yard.  Their poop is allowed everywhere, their stuff is allowed everywhere.***   \n\nI am not going to give you a hard time for failing to assert these boundaries.  The nanny should have respected your original boundary.  However you must learn how to maintain your boundaries.  Not only in this situation, but in all parts of life.  Your standards matter.  Your boundaries are important.  This is your home and your responsibility.  If something isn't ok, you must address it.  People will often push your boundaries if you let them.  You have to be clear that the boundary stands.  The boundary does not move.", "YTA if you tell her to stop making herself at home. N TA if you remind her the dogs coming over was a one time deal and they need to stay home now. Leaving lunch in the fridge for the next day isn\u2019t a big deal. Leaving the car seat for your child at your house shouldn\u2019t be a big deal either. But the dogs can be left at home easily. You just need to kindly remind her that the dogs coming over was a one time deal.", "YWNBTA for bringing up the dogs and ONLY the dogs. \n\nThe coat and some food for herself is not a big deal. I believe you're irritated because you're already very irritated about the dogs, so everything else just feels like a pile on of more annoyances. People can be forgetful and leave a coat. It does not mean they're making themselves at home. I have left coats or something at a friend's house. I am not making myself at home. As for the food, if it's oat milk or something you don't have, I think she's trying to provide something for herself to have throughout the day when she's taking care of YOUR kids. Also, is it seriously that big of a deal to have food for herself when she's minding your kids? My friend used to nanny for people and they would tell her to feel free to have whatever is in the fridge. If you feel like she must always take everything home and \"leave no trace\" like she's camping, you sound very difficult and not hospitable to an employee. \n\nThe issue here is the dogs. You allowed it once due to work going on at her home. Once. She took it as an invitation to do it regularly now. I think it's absolutely appropriate to tell an employee working full time that they can't bring their dogs to work. Most people wouldn't dream of doing it like she has. She took ONE DAY'S EXCEPTION and gave herself permission to do it frequently. \n\nAlso, I own a dog. I don't let my dog shit on my friend's, much less employer's, lawn unless they have dogs that they allow that on. Otherwise, I walk my dog elsewhere. You don't sound like you have dogs so you have a shit free lawn (assuming it's fenced) and you shouldn't have to worry about your kids playing with shit stained grass bits. \n\nAlso, her leaving dog treats or toys behind is a sign she is DEFINITELY getting too comfortable and thinks she can have her cake and eat it too. It's many people's dream to bring their pets to work. Leaving treats at your home in the pantry is her very obvious understanding that she can bring the dogs to work and to give them treats at work and it's A-OK.\n\nAny reasonable employee would understand if you tell them to stop bringing the dogs. If she doesn't get it, she sounds young and inexperienced. My WARNING is that if you tell her this, she might quit and you're left without a nanny.", "YWBTA \u2014 if you say stop making yourself at home. Seems like the only intrusive thing here is the dogs. \n\nYou would not be the ah to tell her the dogs are no longer allowed.\n\nIt is not easy to find good child care \u2026. Pick your battles wisely.", "I'm with you on the dog thing, and I think it's fine to tell her that you thought that her bringing them in was a one-time thing.\n\nBut your other gripes make me feel like you might not be the most understanding employer. She works 9 or 10 hours a day at your house and you're annoyed she might leave a coat or some food there? Come on now.", "INFO: What is your Plan B if she decides to take different work? You and your husband disagree about this issue. So far, this would be a N-A-H situation since you're showing good communication. However, you're indicating that you might veto your husband and talk to her anyway, despite his objection. So what happens if the talk goes badly and she decides she doesn't want to work for you anymore?", "YTA, specifically if you're upset that she leaves food for herself in your fridge because she's coming the next day. The least you could do is spare a bit of room in your fridge, that would be a kindness. My mom lets her caregivers leave food in her fridge when they work a couple days in a row. It's not a bad thing that your nanny does this.\n\nAs far as the dogs go, NTA.", "ESH\n\nShe's an AH because you gave her an inch and she took a marathon's worth of miles. She is taking advantage of you, and it's completely inappropriate as an employee.\n\nYou're an AH for two reasons: 1) you're conflating very minor, normal things like her keeping a small snack in your fridge or leaving/forgetting an item of clothing at your house overnight with incredibly inappropriate behaviours like having her pets run amok on your property. Those are not even comparable, so stop comparing them. As someone who works in your house regularly, you should be *reasonably accommodating* to her. Leaving a small amount of food in your refrigerator or leaving her coat there is not inappropriately \"making herself at home\" - it's something people do at their workplaces. You could use a bit of flexibility.\n\nBut 2) you're also an AH because you should have said something within a few days of her continuing to bring her dogs to your home after what was clearly stated to her as a one-time exception. As the employer, it is up to you to set boundaries and enforce them. Her behaviour is unacceptable, but you're her boss . . . it's literally your responsibility to let her know that. And if you don't, while it's possible to say that she \"should have known\", it's also possible for her to say that she thought your rules had become more flexible. Until you use your grownup words, it remains unclear. And now you've allowed it to go on for . . . weeks? Months? She can't read your mind. Your husband is wrong. It's your home, and it is not one where pets are welcome. You are absolutely meant to tell her that. \n\nESH.

Unfortunately, once they get in the habit of doing something you disagree with, you can't put the genie back in the bottle.

She\u2019s not putting the poo bags in your trash and making your house smell. She\u2019s taking it with her. I assume the car seat is something she uses for your kids in her vehicle? An occasionally forgotten coat is not a big deal. Employees in most places have a break room. She\u2019s a person existing in the space you live to doing work that you hired her for. If you want to constrain her visible presence so you don\u2019t see signs of her existence, get her a mini fridge and put it into a space that she has designated for all these things that you take umbrage with. Like a closet in a hotel room, including a lockbox. Put a sealing diaper bucket near the door and line it with a scented bag so she has something to hide those poo bags in and is a way of you having a touch of control in how she exists in your family\u2019s house. My guess though, is that she spends more time in your house than you do, that the kids are attached to her in a way you wish you could be there for them, that the kids love the dogs and the dogs love them. She literally is a part of your household, a person, not something like a vacuum that you can shut in a closet and not acknowledge its existence when you aren\u2019t using it.

Not only can they potentially hurt your child since your children aren\u2019t used to living with animals, but they could also be a distraction for your nanny to not pay attention to your kid! Furthermore at the least it can lead to broken items in the house and large poops left behind in your yard, especially with the size of the dogs. NTA for telling her NO MORE DOGS allowed.

Start interviewing, and when you find a compatible nanny, let help yourself hannah go.", "ESH yes she's taking advantage of the situation with the dogs. BUT  if it bothered you, you should've spoken up when it started.  Since you didn't, it's going to be a much bigger issue now.  \n\nI also wouldn't recommend picking a fight about her leaving a little food or a jacket there.  As a former nanny, it was incredibly helpful having a tiny space to store food or a sweater (the way someone would keep things in a desk or locker at work) especially if she's not supposed to share your food.", "The dog issue I would address, the others are just forgetting items.

Dogs no.\n\nI've been a nanny, live in and live out and when I was the live out my family made me feel like I was apart of them. They would throw things on the grocery list that I specifically requested and I had a cubby as the 4 of them did as well (it was an extra one because of the space and ir became mine on their request). Especially in the winter this was great because really the only time I needed my snow pants was for child care activities. She's their primary caregiver during that time and you should WANT her to be comfortable. \n\nYou can set boundaries, absolutely, reiterate no dogs but damn loosen up on a jacket.", "The dogs are a HARD no but he other things you described are perfectly normal workplace behaviour so the only real issue you've described is the dogs.\n\nThe dogs need to GTFO and stay out.", "NTA.

If there's an emergency where she insists on bringing them, then tell her you're sorry she won't be able to make it to work that day, no dogs at your place. \n\nI nannied for years and brought my *one small* dog to work with me, but it didn't start that way at all. I was extremely hesitant in asking if my dog could come, and they already had an existing dog-I had clients without pets and automatically counted them as not pet friendly unless they brought it up otherwise! I asked about everything too! Do you mind if I leave a toy for him? Do you mind if he's on the furniture with your dog? Would you like me to do any additional cleaning? The poop thing is just nuts and unhygienic!! Tell her it's gross and she needs to dispose of it outside next time you see it!! \n\nOthers are right, leaving a coat or food is simple workplace expectations. BUT, it's your house not an office.

Tell her to stop bringing the dogs.", "NTA for telling her NO Dogs allowed. TA big time for getting upset about a coat or a little bit of food in the fridge. If it\u2019s her food and she\u2019s not consuming all of your groceries what\u2019s the problem? She should have a designated area for a coat, handbag, umbrella, etc. She should probably have her own designated little space in your fridge and maybe her own drawer in your kitchen as well. That way she can have a place to keep her own food and snacks without having bring stuff every time.", "Most of this stuff is minor and should be looked over but NTA on the dogs! I love dogs and interacting with dogs (yet I only have a cat) but it\u2019s not appropriate for them to be at your place of employment (unless it\u2019s a veterinary hospital even then\u2026). Tell Nanny that if she wants to keep her job then the dogs cannot be in your home. NO EXCEPTIONS!", "It's time to interview her replacement. Next thing you know, she's going to be showering in your master bedroom suite and leaving her laundry in your dryer. This woman has some pieces missing in her head.", "Man.....NTA for the dog stuff. But you really hurt your case whining about a bit of leftovers and a coat. She's literally raising your babies. She lives half her life there. Of COURSE she is going to get comfortable, she SHOULD!

I'd ask her when her garden landscaping is going to be finished and see what she says. \n\nBut, as a former nanny, it's unreasonable to be upset if she forgets a jacket or leaves food in the fridge. I think you're annoyed about the dogs and so every little thing is annoying you, which is normal. But I would recommend not mentioning these issues.", "NTA\n\nYou set a rule, and she took advantage of the exception and changed the rule. I think a simple way to address this is;\n\n\"X, when you first asked about bringing your dogs, I said no.

I've been lenient, but I need you to stop bringing your dogs over.\"\n\nAlso be prepared for if she decides to quit. That's her decision too.\n\nI do think you're going a bit far on the other stuff. Like, she's working for you. Your home is her office. She should be allowed to leave a jacket or a snack she'd prefer while taking care of your kids for a majority of the day. Being annoyed by that is a little much. If it's so bothersome, perhaps offer a spot that's out of sight for you but easy for her to have these things.

When I worked outside the home I left stuff there all the time - so long as her stuff isn't scattered all over the house and she's leaving them in a contained area, I think it's fine to leave a jacket or a car seat or a little food in the fridge at the place where you spend 45-50 hours a week.", "YTA for not establishing boundaries. If you keep letting her do what you\u2019re complaining about, how can you blame her? She asks your permission and you say yes. You\u2019re being unfair to her by complaining in your head and to Reddit, but not being an adult and a fair, responsible employer by setting those boundaries.", "I think your reasons of leaving her belongings by accident, leaving food in the fridge for the next day, etc are so silly and you\u2019re the AH there.\n\nBut for the dogs, you are NTA.

You are absolutely within reason to say that (nicely).", "NTA. \n\nLeaving a coat or a bit of food behind in the fridge until the next day probably would bother me at all, but the whole dog situation definitely would.

The coat and good thing is just you being a little bit of an asshole but the dogs are another story. That\u2019s extremely unprofessional and I would likely fire a nanny for that. I cannot imagine thinking it\u2019s okay to bring two relatively large animals and just setting up shop in someone else\u2019s literal home. That show really poor judgement on her part. Frankly, it\u2019s just rude and weird. But you need to communicate and set that boundary firmly. Under no circumstances should the dogs be allowed, there is absolutely no reason.

Tell her it's gone on long enough and you won't allow the dogs there anymore. Give logical reasons, such as the dog poop, which carries parasites. If she ignores that, maybe start interviewing for a new nanny. \nAs for her leaving little things. Get her a small fridge in the garage or somewhere she can conveniently access. I think most ppl will leave things at their job with the intention of coming back to it. The problem is that her job is your home.

Draw a firm line on that if you don\u2019t want them at your house.", "Bang on.  Also, if the car seat is yours and for your kid, she should not be expected to constantly have it in her car.  They take up a lot of room and maybe she has errands or friends and needs the space.  You should tell her the dogs aren\u2019t allowed.  If she brings them again, you\u2019ll need to start looking for a new nanny, because this one will trample over your boundaries and rules including whatever rules you have for your children.", "I thought the same thing. Presumably she\u2019s there daily at least through the week, so unless it\u2019s taking up space (or pungent, like you said), leaving an item of food or clothing overnight is a reasonable expectation\n\nThe dogs though. That issue needs a hard border drawn around it", "This point is well made. Most people WANT the nanny to be like part of the family. And complaining that someone left a coat really makes it sound like OP is ridiculously entitled and generally spoiled. However, they explained at the beginning that dogs are not allowed, which is reasonable. \n\nOP does though run the risk that if she confronts the nanny, that the nanny will leave. This would make her a huge AH, not for what she did to the nanny, but for what she did to her own household, more specifically her husband.

You should have said something the first time she brought them without your approval. \n\nIt\u2019s time for a sit down with you, your husband and your nanny.
