Have you talked to Alyssa directly about how she feels about this? Does she feel invalidated or marginalized?", "NTA. \n\nMichaela is annoyingly unhelpful. \n\nAnd if Josh is actually a shitty person, Michaela is one too for suggesting Alyssa get back together with him.", "NTA. Kind of seems like Michaela should have been getting the message much sooner. And now she's complaining to Alyssa about her problems with you, instead of supporting Alyssa. Maybe she doesn't know how to provide emotional support? Or, as you say, maybe she really is that self-absorbed.", "ehhhh.... \n\ni get why people are saying NTA but I've been around women enough to know when women have a problem they usually want commiserating not problem solving.  while Michaela sounds like an insufferable... person... it does sound like she's trying to commiserate with her friend.  the problem is her commiserating sounds more like bragging, and either she's too narcissistic to notice or care, or just that bad at reading a room and doesn't realize what she sounds like. \n\nESH, i think Michaela is trying to help, and you sorta went over a line and your friend alyssa sounds like a drama queen, who's enjoying the chaos this is causing, by playing telephone.  \n\nIt sounds like you need better friends.", "NTA\n\nIs Michaela being helpful? Absolutely not. Did she need to be told that? Yes. Could there have been a gentler way of telling her? Probably. Would that have gotten the point across? Probably not. \n\nMichaela reminds me of that girl that pays excessive attention to the kid on crutches in grade school and sticks to them like glue. It signals a need to be the center of attention even when the focus should be on someone else.  When someone is so absorbed in their need for being the center of attention that they need to make everything about them, there isn't much you can do to shift their focus. What you did was take the attention away from Michaela so that it could properly be refocused on Alyssa. Maybe it was harsh, but you stood up for a wounded friend and for that, you are NTA.", "NTA.

There comes a point when you have to draw the line, I can see Alyssa crying into her hankie until next bf comes along.

I understand!\u201d Part of it was tone deafness with a side of self-centeredness. The other part was poor modeling from my parents who would do the exact same thing - the number of times my dad would refer to f-king Seinfeld or Three and a Half Men to analogize whatever personal problem I was having\u2026.\n\nI was - legit - trying to help and comfort. But was too self centered and self-referential to realize that it always redirected to me. Which I am doing a bit here, lol. \n\nYour friend Michaela needed to hear it, but her heart is likely in the right place. If she is tone deaf and lower on EQ, having you explain why what she is doing comes across as wrong before you reached the exploding point rather than saying, knock it off, might have helped. But I get it. That\u2019s why I say NAH.\n\nMe, it was realizing my sister did it to me and how annoying it is. And then the Book, \u201cShut the F- Up.\u201d \n\nI also say that six months of constant crying from your friend, without significant evidence of improving, may indicate she needs more help than what you guys can provide. \n\nYou are a good person and sound like a wonderful friend. Good luck.", "Trying to relate to people like that is also common with neurodivergences. When ND people say things like that, they mean \"I empathize with what you're going through and I'm trying to show that I do.\" But it comes across somewhere from \"I think I can relate because of thing that's not very similar\" to \"yeah, yeah, enough about your problems, let's talk about mine.\" And it's something we have to train ourselves out of.\n\n(I am *not* saying that Michaela is necessarily ND. She could very well just have main character syndrome. Or she could be ND and not trying to trim herself out of this because she had main character syndrome. Just throwing out another possibility.)", "There is only so many ways to tell a person in the nicest way to shut it.", "THIS - common with ADHD.", "Impact>intent. It doesn\u2019t matter if Michaela is ND. She\u2019s hurting Alyssa.", "It runs in my family as well. It\u2019s a symptom of ADHD. I had to train myself out of it."]}
