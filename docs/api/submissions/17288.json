Despite any apologies he made, Alyssa made it clear she never wanted to see him again. Michaela also has a boyfriend, Keith, of 2 years.\n\nAlyssa was a mess after the breakup. She was sobbing or in bed most of the time. I've done my best to support her, talked if she needed it, etc. However, if Alyssa is ever venting, Michaela brings up her own relationship problems, saying stuff like \"I get what you mean, Keith forgot my favorite color once\". I've told her multiple times that this is just unhelpful and Alyssa agreed with me. Recently, Alyssa called us over because she needed support. We said yes and all met up.\n\nWhen we get there, Alyssa looked like she'd been crying for hours.

She once again states that, \"Keith and I had broken up once for a few days and I was heartbroken, but we made up so maybe you and Josh could make up too\" Keep in mind, she KNEW Josh was a shitty person and Alyssa had no intent on seeing him again. And when Alyssa said she had felt unappreciated by Josh while dating, Michaela goes \"Oh, Keith forgot to buy me flowers for our anniversary dinner too.\"\n\nMichaela KEPT GOING, and I tried to tell her it was unhelpful. I don't like to compare problems, but I just found this ridiculous. I turn to Michaela and yell, \"We get it, your boyfriend doesn't get you a flower. But while you're so busy talking about your own minor relationship issues that you could do literally ANY OTHER TIME, your friend is crying becase she doesn't have a relationship anymore after 6 years. Alyssa clearly doesn't want to go back into a relationship with Josh and it's not happening, and you know everything he did. You're not helping, for the 10th fucking time, and nobody cares about your own relationship problems.\"\n\nI know I was harsh, and it wasn't fair to be comparing their problems, but there's a right time and place for everything and it felt like Michaela was being so self-absorbed. She's not talking to me, she's talking to Alyssa and Alyssa says she's pretty pissed off at me for making her feel like her problems were irrelevant.

Michaela has main character syndrome it seems. And she may be doing her best to comfort Alyssa by \u201crelating\u201d to Alyssa\u2019s problems, it\u2019s not helping, hasn\u2019t helped, and won\u2019t help.\n\nYou\u2019ve told Michaela nice enough numerous times to shut up, listen, and be there for moral support. Have you talked to Alyssa directly about how she feels about this? Does she feel invalidated or marginalized?", "NTA. \n\nMichaela is annoyingly unhelpful. \n\nAnd if Josh is actually a shitty person, Michaela is one too for suggesting Alyssa get back together with him.", "NTA. Kind of seems like Michaela should have been getting the message much sooner. And now she's complaining to Alyssa about her problems with you, instead of supporting Alyssa. Maybe she doesn't know how to provide emotional support? Or, as you say, maybe she really is that self-absorbed.", "ehhhh.... \n\ni get why people are saying NTA but I've been around women enough to know when women have a problem they usually want commiserating not problem solving.  while Michaela sounds like an insufferable... person... it does sound like she's trying to commiserate with her friend.  the problem is her commiserating sounds more like bragging, and either she's too narcissistic to notice or care, or just that bad at reading a room and doesn't realize what she sounds like. \n\nESH, i think Michaela is trying to help, and you sorta went over a line and your friend alyssa sounds like a drama queen, who's enjoying the chaos this is causing, by playing telephone.  \n\nIt sounds like you need better friends.", "NTA\n\nIs Michaela being helpful? Absolutely not. Did she need to be told that? Yes. Could there have been a gentler way of telling her? Probably. Would that have gotten the point across? Probably not. \n\nMichaela reminds me of that girl that pays excessive attention to the kid on crutches in grade school and sticks to them like glue. It signals a need to be the center of attention even when the focus should be on someone else.  When someone is so absorbed in their need for being the center of attention that they need to make everything about them, there isn't much you can do to shift their focus. What you did was take the attention away from Michaela so that it could properly be refocused on Alyssa. Maybe it was harsh, but you stood up for a wounded friend and for that, you are NTA.", "NTA. Michaela thinks that everything always has to be about her. She\u2019s not helping at all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Everyone has the right to have their feelings.", "NTA. Her problems *were* irrelevant", "This was my take also. There comes a point when you have to draw the line, I can see Alyssa crying into her hankie until next bf comes along. Meanwhile I also see people do this a lot where they try to share an experience, it can be tone deaf, does it make her an AH, no prob not, I mean she\u2019s still dropping everything to handhold her friend."]}
