His new girlfriend was a little odd in that she didn\u2019t talk much and she pretty much just hovered around my brother-in-law. I tried to find a way to connect with her. I quickly found the only thing we have in common is the family we now share. So this is what I spoke about.\n\nI gushed over how wonderful it was that she slid right into the family so easily and that everyone loves her because it wasn\u2019t like that for me. I spent years being viewed as the \u201cother woman\u201d by my mother-in-law. It\u2019s not exactly a secret, so I didn\u2019t think anything of sharing my experience. I told her that my mother-in-law has never spoken so highly about any of the other significant others as she does her. Certainly not me as she\u2019s said plenty of incredibly hurtful things to me over the years. \n\nI also spoke on how my husband and I got married at 18 and how I\u2019m shocked that we had so much support to do so. We were far from ready to be married, but his mother literally told us we would be stupid to not to get married because he was joining the military. We ultimately got married because of her. \n\nEverything seemed great when they left. We flew home a couple months later and walked into what felt like a meticulously set trap. Apparently when my new sister-in-law came home, the first thing she did was go to my mother-in-law and tell her that I hate her. She told her I spent the entire trip trash talking her. That I said she forced us to get married and warned her to be careful around her because she\u2019s two-faced. She told her she \u201cJust felt she should know.\u201d \n\nI was completely destroyed and confused. I tried to stumble through some sort of explanation, but my words were twisted. That\u2019s not at all what I said and it was never my intent. I questioned why nobody came to me to give me a chance to defend myself? Apparently my mother-in-law decided to first take the opportunity to cry to the rest of the family about what a monster I am to say these things \u201cafter everything she\u2019s done for me.\u201d She told everybody to not reach out to me about it because she \u201cwanted to talk to me about it in person.\u201d \n\nWe flew across the country with no idea that the entire family is angry at me and has been talking about what a terrible person I am for months. I\u2019ve been in this family for 7 years at this point and everyone chose to believe the new girlfriend over me. Am I not owed some bit of loyalty? I was incredibly hurt and I still am because they\u2019ve all been super close with this new girlfriend ever since and never once questioned her or her motives. My husband and I believe this was her way of securing her place in the family. \n\nThe family is acting like I\u2019m the problem for not burying the hatchet with her. She plays the innocent victim well, but I don\u2019t trust her one bit. I\u2019m not going to be fake and pretend I like her. I\u2019ll be cordial and coexist, but I believe she had malicious intent.

You tried to bond by talking about your negative experience with the family members that eventually become her family members. I know you didn\u2019t mean to be an AH, but you were. You spoke about people behind their backs and then you question why they are doing the same. I don\u2019t know what else you expected to come of this. There are many other small talk topics you could hade chosen. You need to just apologize to MIL and tell her (without blaming SIL) that it was not your intent to speak badly of her.

I think you picked an unwise topic for conversation in the first place, but knowing your MIL liked her, it\u2019s not shocking that SIL felt loyalty to her and her interests. That conversation with a friend or someone who doesn\u2019t know your in laws and has very little chance of ever meeting them is probably fine. But you were talking to a member of the family whose relationship to her MIL is more direct and of longer standing than to a woman she just met. Again, unwise to talk about this with her.

This may be unpopular but here it goes: everything you said about your MIL had negative undertones to it so you can\u2019t be surprised that your SIL misinterpreted your motives for sharing those things. Your SIL was wrong for telling your MIL what you said and you should never confide in her again. However, your hands aren\u2019t clean here.

I didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true or that hasn\u2019t been said before. It\u2019s the fact that she turned around and said that I said I hate her and that I warned her to be careful.

Gossiping, spreading rumors, and name calling is. I already apologized to both of them as soon as I was finally told what had transpired. I am still greatly disappointed that everyone just took her word for it and waited months to ask me about it. That\u2019s where it felt I was owed a tiny be of loyalty, or perhaps a better word is grace.", "I agree. It was truly unwise of me to share anything with her. She was so awkward and I was trying to fill the quiet. I just started talking hoping she might pick something up and run with it. The things I said are not secrets and I\u2019ve said them to my MIL before. My MIL and I have talked about how hard it was for me to be the first girlfriend of the family and how she wasn\u2019t the most loving or accepting because of it. All of these past experiences were common knowledge within the family unit. It never crossed my mind that it was inappropriate in that moment. It just kind of became a \u201chaha, remember when\u2026\u201d thing in the family.

I expected the family I have been in for years to have loyalty enough to give me the common courtesy to explain myself before they just took off believing I said I hate her. I never said that.", "Perhaps you\u2019re right that there were negative undertones to what I said. I have been so focused on my intentions that I never stepped back and analyzed it any deeper. The fact of the matter is that I was extremely envious of the way she was loved and accepted and I still am. The woman can do no wrong in their eyes and I\u2019ve always felt like the black sheep both in my family and my husband\u2019s family. So maybe there were negative undertones, but it\u2019s not because I hate my MIL.

The family hated her with a fiery passion and it was tearing my BIL apart because they treated that girlfriend like garbage. I reached out to my BIL to let him know that we love and support him and I told HIM that I \u201cknow how his mother can be.\u201d because she treated me like garbage too!

Some of these responses are pretty intense and it\u2019s definitely got my heart aching. The question was AITA for not burying the hatchet. Seems a lot of these people want to focus on the fact that I missed a social cue and somehow that makes me a psychopath. I had already established that I overshared and shouldn\u2019t have.

If you don\u2019t want to be held accountable for something you said, you shouldn\u2019t have said it.", "You're trusting the wrong people. Your circle is your husband and you - that's all.", "Thanks for sharing your viewpoint. BIL came to us for support when he felt his mother was causing problems in his previous relationship. We offered him that support, told him he could come live with us for a bit if he needed to, and said we understood how she can be in an attempt to validate his feelings. That\u2019s why I\u2019m surprised he went back to his mom because he came to us. Or maybe he just told his girlfriend and she went back to MIL. The story is unclear and has continually changed.", "Ugh. You\u2019re so right. This seems to be a recurring issue for me. I used to pride myself on not being bitter and closed off despite the cards I\u2019ve been dealt. I was a very \u201cgood vibes only\u201d type of person before this happened.
