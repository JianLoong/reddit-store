I stay at his house for long periods of time but have not 100% moved in because he inherited his house and it's quite cluttered. There isn't space for me to bring my things yet. However I do keep a lot of clothes there. Now for some context, it might sound stupid but I'm a huge germaphobe. I also take really good care of my clothes, he even teases me about how particular I am sometimes.\nAnyway, I feel so frustrated. I love his daughter. I have known her and loved her longer than I have him as I use to be her teacher and she was my favorite. We have a great relationship and I love her to pieces. She will sometimes wear her dad's shirts to sleep. Tonight I am not over as I needed to take care of some things. He did laundry and when he does laundry (and im not there) he dumps it all out on a bed and leaves it there (UGHHHHHHHHH). Well she apparently wanted to wear one of my shirts. My absolute favorite shirt actually (not a pajama shirt, I wear this out). Now I know her and I know how she is. Like many kids, she often sits and pulls her knees up to the neck and stretches the neck out, or chews it, or yanks at the neck or uses it to wipe her mouth when eating... I see her do it daily and she's done it to one of mine before (I ended up letting her keep it).\nShe's wanted to wear my shirts in the past which is why I let her pick out pajamas to wear and bought her several pairs. I have said before I don't  want her to wear my clothes. And I hate doing that. I hate saying no to something like that. It makes me feel like a total dick but it's just not something I'm okay with. It could be anyone honestly. \nWell he sent me a video of her in my favorite shirt saying \"You snooze you lose\" and laughing (he thought it was funny/cute) and it actually has made me mad... I hate that I feel this way because I feel like saying no or that I don't like it is me being a \"mean/crazy/selfish girlfriend \" because she's probably wearing it because she always wants to be like me. But I'm actually just not cool with it. I felt bad texting and saying \"nooo please that's my favorite shirt\" because it's JUST A SHIRT and I feel stupid, but this genuinely made me mad. I feel disrespected. Am I the asshole? =/\n\nTLDR: I've asked that bfs daughter doesn't wear my clothes because I don't want them ruined and bought her several pajamas for her to wear instead.

Don\u2019t reply with a cutesy begging response. Tell him to take it off her and going forward to respect the boundary that you very clearly stated.", "NTA.  Time to sit them both down and explain that she is not to wear your clothes without permission. PERIOD.   I would make it more about respect than the actual clothing.\n\n Say something like: \" You don't take things that don't belong to you without permission from the owner. No, your dad cannot tell you it's OK to wear my things only I can. If you take my things without asking first, I will be mad at you.   It is rude, disrespectful and tells me that you do not value our friendship.  It makes me feel like I can't trust you around my things.  If someone took your favorite toy and damaged it, how would you feel about them? Would you be mad? Probably, huh.  That's how I feel when you do that with my clothes because you do things to my shirts that I would not do. Like put your knees up inside, use the sleeves or collar like a napkin or wipe your hands down the front.  I don't like it when you do those things as it damages my clothes. So please, do not wear my clothes without asking first. \"\n\nMaybe offer to keep a few t- shirts of yours there that she can use without permission if she's missing you.  Let her know you understand she misses you when you're gone and wearing something of yours is comforting to her, but she must have your permission first.  Maybe take her to build-a- bear and record a message to go inside so she can hear you say \"I miss you and love you lots, sweetie\" whenever she squeezes the right spot.  This is a lesson best learned now while she's young.", "NTA. You've already asked your bf to not have her wear your clothes. Don't feel bad about saying no. They should respect that you not wanting her to wear your clothes makes you feel comfortable.", "NTA \n\nBut please make yourself more clear to your bf. He's treating it like it's a funny joke because your response to him sounds like it's a joke. Sit them both down for a serious conversation about how you need your personal space and there should be boundaries. I wouldn't touch my own mother's clothes without asking her first or even any of my siblings. It's a matter of respect and they need to understand this.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't an unreasonable boundary. That he can't hold it is alarming and says a lot about how you'll be treated during future conflicts. There is absolutely zero reason he should be allowing her to ruin your favorite clothes (I would be livid btw, just a shirt or not, you chose it and bought it. It's not a damn pajama top!)\n\nAs I see it:\n\n- Buy a couple of shirts on sale, wear them around the house, be clear that these, and only these, shirts are up for grabs. Then let the daughter keep them. Annoying, but she'll age out of this, probably pretty quickly. **But** you are just kicking this \"bf ignores me where his daughter is concerned\" can further down the relationship road.\n\nOr\n\n- Make this your hill with your bf. Be uber clear that he is *not* to give her your clothes. They're yours, you don't want them ruined by a child, and this shouldn't be so freaking hard to get across. Base the relationship's potential on how he handles it. \n\nThere's obviously middle ground options, but imho they lack a resolution for you and the kind of clarity kids need.", "NTA you say no he should stop here. If he wants his daughter to dress like you he can buy similar clothes for her.", "OP just refuse to let him launder any more of your clothes and hold onto everything, because the more she doesn't understand boundaries the worse it's going to be for her to understand the real world.  The same can also be said for your bf, and if they don't \"get it\" then you may have to re-think your overall relationship and if you can compromise on this.  It's such a mismatch from your posting how you two can mesh your living situations, but it's something you have to process because you need to resolve this sooner than later.", "NTA. I'm super possessive over my stuff. If I catch any of my family wearing my stuff (Especially growing up) I would make them go change. I had so many of my things destroyed when I havent had it for a week...which is actually probably why im possessive over my stuff. \n\nFor me, this is basic respect. It needs to be expressed to both of them, not unkindly but sternly that this is not okay. It isn't just about your clothing, its about atonomy over your things and your ability to have your NO respected in any kind of relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd think being a teacher, you'd understand the psychological of kids, but she's mimicking you. I'd recommend buying some clothes you feel comfortable sharing with her, even if you dont wear them all the time. The mocking video is a step too far but I would like to remind you, most people dont have this security about their clothing, so yes, its a step across the boundary, but the boundary is admittedly hard to see for most people, so be easy on them. \n\nAs far as germaphobia, this is your opputunity to break out of it, use it, please.", "NTA.

He might nominally, and then as soon as you turn your back- he completely disregards your feelings. \n\nI'd bet this isn't the only thing you feel guilty about having an opinion on or setting a boundary for.
