Thanks to reddit if I'm honest. Earlier today he came to see her and near the end of his visit he asked if we could speak privately. So I told our child to go play in her room. The conversation was about when he was available to spend time with her, when he wasn't going to be in town, etc. During the conversation our child came back into the room and got in front of me saying mommy mommy, repeatedly. I addressed her and answered her questions. It happened several times and by the fifth time her father got mad. He put his hand on her shoulder. The moment he started speaking to her about her manners she started to tear up and I snapped. I got her away from him.\n\n With that being sad of course people would say why would you act like that. My child does not cry from someone correcting her or explaining things. Only when something hurts. He had been squeezing her shoulder with every word he said. She ran crying to her room. And the argument between us began. \"I'm babying her, nothing else works so he had to make her understand.\" I shook my head and told him he needed to leave. He insisted he wasn't in the wrong I was.\n\n I told him acting like that and putting fear in your child is a slippery slope. He knows first hand my father was abusive. It started off comments about my weight, then it went to installing fear with threats or just glares then to full on beatings with my dad. It's a slippery slope. He then got angry and said you saying I'm your dad. I told him no I didn't say that. But I remember being little and what he just did using his strength to make her listen my father did once upon a time too. He left and now my phone is being blown up by his family saying how dare I say he is abusive and I should lose my custody for letting my child do whatever she wants. \n\nAITA for saying/doing these things?\n\nEdit 1: when I say squeezing I'm not meaning lightly she has a bright red mark from where he was squeezing. And not squeezing and letting go then squeezing again. Just straight squeezing tighter and tighter with each word.\n\nEdit 2: I have taken pictures of the red mark and have it documented. Tonight I'll be having a conversation with her about knowing she can't always interrupt mommy when mommy say go play and we are having a movie night. \n\nI've already sent an email to her therapist and asked if we can meet sometime Monday and have a session. I thought about it and I don't want to be the one to ask her right out if something like this has happened before so he can't say I'm the one who told her what to say. I will not be in the therapy room either. I've never been in the room with her outside of our joint sessions. I know sometimes as a kid it's hard to talk about something if you have a parent right there. \n\nMy child does know respect. But she also is learning that she does come first in my life. I've been working since she was a baby, yes I made time for her even when I was dead on my feet but I did miss things in her life for my job. Now I don't put my job, my family(parents, siblings, etc.) Over her.  If she wants my attention I'll give it to her. She knows if mommy is on the phone she has to wait unless it's an emergency. She's a good kid. And if I'm honest I know I haven't been mom of the year once since I've been a mom. I've made mistakes as I tried to navigate motherhood pretty much on my own. I've tried my best to give her what I didn't have, that's a childhood nor a loving family. I got an abusive father and a mother who cared more about herself being loved than her children. I had no one in my corner even when it came out my father was abusive. I've never had someone that I know if I go to they would drop everything to make sure I'm okay. I'm giving that to my daughter and if you think that's wrong then let's agree to disagree..", "created_utc": 1687642877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14i4g4z/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_father_its_a/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've experienced this with my ex and my daughter, so I can vividly picture the scene. \n\nRather than smacking her, which he knew others would consider abusive, he would pinch the back of her arm or slowly squeeze her shoulders to the point of pain, or yank the back underside of her hair discreetly so that it wasn't obvious what he was doing and no one could prove it, then he could say she was being dramatic and all he did was give her a little tap to get her attention because I was allowing her to run amok. He would blame ME for not handling the issue, things that, IMO, weren't even issues, but things that were annoying to him or took everyone's undivided attention away from him for a split second...or things that were minor issues that would have been better dealt with in a later, non physical corrective action.\n\nImmediately, things would devolve into her crying out of fear/pain, me upset because he had just hurt her, and him looking cool as a cucumber, telling anyone around us that we were both being dramatic because he \"had to step in and correct her\" and now I was angry because he wouldn't allow her to \"dominate the situation.\" And of course, he would always downplay his \"correction\" (abuse) and onlookers would believe him, because she and I were the ones now looking hysterical while he maintained his composure, so surely he couldn't be so cool and composed and have done anything drastic within a manner of seconds, because he didn't appear to be upset or losing his temper.\n\nYou aren't TA, but he is a huge one.", "NTA that's physical abuse", "I hope you photographed the red mark to document.  I hope you're talking with your lawyer to change the custody agreement to make sure this man can't be alone with this child unsupervised.\n\nWhat he did is child abuse.  The fact that he's defending it is scary.  It doesn't matter if your kid was doing something very, very wrong, it was still abusive and it's still inexcusable.\n\nHe's the one who should lose custody.  Your family is wrong.  Don't listen to them.  Block them if you have to.\n\nSeriously, I'd move to freaking New Zealand to get my child away from this man if I had to.  \n\nNTA\n\nP.S.

Good that you\u2019re intervening! that being said: You should teach your daughter not to just interrupt people when they are having a conversation. She doesn\u2019t have to call out for mommy again and again. That\u2019s annoying behaviour and at some point she\u2019ll get in trouble by not respecting boundaries.

I have never lied to her and I'm straightforward and explain things most would probably scowled me for. My child knows why she has no relationship with her grandfather on my side. She understands the importance of speaking out when something is wrong or something has happened that is either confusing or off happens to her if that makes sense. \n\nWe are gonna have a movie night tonight watching her favorite, Harry Potter. Before we begin the movie I plan on asking her if anything like this has happened before. \n\nI've documented everything. I have two emails in which I sent things to that have to do with his relationship with her. I made it when we separated so if he ever tried to take me to court I could show proof of all the times he hasn't been present and can't say I \"keep her away from him\". \n\nI saw my mom go through this when she left my father and I've definitely learned from her mistakes.", "Right! He hasn't done anything like that in front of me but before we separated he took her to see his family in another state. I don't like his family for a whole other reason but I was unable to attend. It was Christmas last year. She is old enough she knows how to use her emergency phone which has kids messenger where the only person she can contact is me. She called me crying because he allowed his family to look at her (A 6 YEAR OLD GIRL) and tell her it's such a shame you look so much like your mother you'd be prettier if you didn't. \n\nI snapped that time and he tried to push the issue under the rug but heck it was already too late. The moment I answered and saw the tears rolling down her face I looked at my boss said I have to leave now and he just nodded and I rushed out to my car and already began the 8 hour drive to his family's house. Picked her up around 2 am and just her and I drove back home. He stayed up there a week and I didn't give two hoots. \n\nI know abusive behavior and at one point he was going to therapy and actually was doing good. But then he stopped going and I had enough and walked away.", "You're right. I could have however multiple times before we separated I'd do that. \"Mommy's talking go play and I'll be right there.\" The problem is the times I did that he would then make comments such as \"you never give her the time of day\" or \" See Monkey(nickname for our daughter) mommy doesn't want to be bothered by you.\" Then come to find out after we separated he would tell her I would say that so she would leave me alone.

He even agreed to the recommendation even though he denied ever saying that. \n\nHer questions weren't unrelated to her father either. They were questions like \"did daddy tell you he wants to take me to the zoo?\" \"When can we go to the zoo with daddy?\". Questions about how she wanted to spend time with him. \n\nThat's another reason I let her continue as well. Since we have separated he hasn't really spent anytime with her outside of twice, once about a week and a half ago and then today.

You don't want to end up fat like your aunt.\" He wasn't her bio dad, thank goodness, but he did a lot of damage. By the time we got out, she was 11, and he literally took her aside and told her she was a product of r*pe and that I hadn't wanted her (which was something I had confided in him before I knew what he was, and had made it clear that once she was born, it was different, and I would have never said such a thing to her; I had always just told her that her bio dad was not a good man). He went on to tell her that I resented her being alive (which was totally untrue) and that she would be better off staying with him, because I was now a single mom with no income and he had all the boats, jet skis, golf carts, 4wheelers, swimming pool...etc and she didn't want to \"grow up as poor white welfare trash that all the kids would make fun of,\" would she? \"Because that's what will happen if you live with your mom.\"\n\nShe chose to stay with me, but that broke her & she had trouble trusting me for years.

I strongly suggest her having less contact with her father. If he can\u2019t have a healthy relationship with her then he doesn\u2019t get the right to have a relationship at all. Honestly I\u2019d notify child protective services. They may brush it off. But he shouldn\u2019t be abusing your child like that.

Please discuss this with the therapist, and after they\u2019ve had a conversation with your daughter, ask if this is something that you should involve the courts in. At a minimum I\u2019d want a judge to make an order that her father is not allowed to physically punish her in any way, shape, or form. What he did was absolutely abuse, and no child deserves that. If he would hurt her for interrupting, what will he do when she really misbehaves and he loses his temper, and you\u2019re not around?"]}
