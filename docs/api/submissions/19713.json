He was sat in the garden smoking, I could only see him because of how I garden is shaped, and shouted at him to either go sort out the toilet or he could go sh*t in the fields with the other cows.

If you ass-blast or clog a toilet, you clean it or unclog it. It's nasty, it's shit, but everyone does it. Doesn't mean other people wanna clean up your shit. He needed to learn to clean his shit up a long time ago, he's 20 for fucks sake. You did his future life partner (this chick or someone else, who knows) a favor by embarrassing him into action.

That actually sounds really funny to yell at him. He deserved it.", "He\u2019s already a 20 years old. I\u2019m sure this is not the first time.

Your brother\u2019s habits are disgusting and he needs to clean up after himself! \n\nYou yelled, justifiably, at your brother about something that needed immediately attention.
