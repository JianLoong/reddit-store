I was in a position where I could pay for her and for myself.\n\nI did everything, booked the hotels, and book tours. Before going to the actual trip, I did asked every family member if they were interested in joining in our Vietnam and Hong Kong trip. My younger brother said he wants to go. I did tell him that I am going to book everything because it is easier for us to make sure we have the same reservation and that he is to pay me back and he said he agreed. I also told him that he has to share the expenses of the trip as well, but I will pay for myself and our mom and he understood that too.\n\nWe went on a 23-day family vacation trip to Vietnam and Hong Kong, which total approximately $13,000 total. During the trip, I told him that since I don't need his part right away, he can pay me when I get accepted to Med or PA school. This was back in 2019.\n\nFast forward to 3 months ago, I approached him to ask him when he has the funds to pay me back. He lied straight to my face and said \"I already paid you.\" I said ok, can you show me a receipt that you paid me? I don't see it in my bank statement or email. Then he starts to yell at me saying \"I AINT PAYING YOU SH\\*T!\" He claims that since \"I don't do anything around the house,\" he owes me nothing, which is not true at all. I help out the house a lot and more than he knows. He didn't even bother to ask how much he even owes.\n\nDuring this argument, I told him that if he doesn't pay me then I will sue him. He said \"FINE GO AHEAD. I DONT CARE.\" 3-months have passed, I have been holding onto the complaint paperwork and all the receipts I have for our vacation trip just to see if his attitude towards me or towards the situation changes. But, it hasn't and I have had enough of it. What made crossed the line was that he continues to lie and refuses to take any responsibilities. I have bought a very expensive air fryer and I told him that if he wants to use it, this is how you take care of it (this was sent via text with my older siblings CCed on it). He refuses to do it, and then one day, it stopped working. I confronted him about it and he told me \"I DIDNT BREAK IT, I NEVER USED THE AIR FRYER.\" That is also a lie and this is when I realize that he will never take responsibility and will lie about it.\n\nSo, I have officially submit a complaint against him to pay me back for $3000 (less than 1/3 of the cost btw). I have always told our parents and siblings that he needs to go to counseling or therapy because he has issues that he needs to work out. If I do win the case, he can either pay me back for what he owes or he can agree to use what he owes me to go to counseling/therapy to workout whatever issues he needs to work out.\n\nAITA for reaching to this point and suing my younger brother for a family vacation that I paid for?\n\nEDIT:\n\nI do not have a written agreement. But I have receipts, invoices, bank statements, and credit card statements that shows everything I paid for.

Weird brother to not be held accountable to a large sum like that. Wonder why no one is backing you up in a serious way.

Your brother played you, and he\u2019s likely going to get away with it. I\u2019m sorry, OP. No good deed goes unpunished.\n\n\nI will say, though, that trying to force your brother into therapy would be just as much a waste of money.

My younger brother lived with my older brother and our sister-in-law for 6-months. He tried to lie and short-change them every opportunity that he got.

If not, good luck getting a penny out of him.", "If you were to try and recover the money I would go to small claims court - the parties generally represent themselves without attorneys so you wouldn't have to foot that extra cost. However, most states cap recovery from small claims to $5,000 so just keep that in mind (but check your states laws because each one is different). \n\nIf you decide to sue civilly, this can take anywhere from months to a few years. Attorneys fees can add up very quickly (between $350/hr to $650/hr in my area). You can see if an attorney in your area would be wiling to take this case on a contingency basis - where you pay for the court/filing fees and in some cases don't have any legal fees unless your case prevails, but then the attorney gets 1/3rd of whatever money you're awarded (but these agreements differ attorney to attorney so you'd have to get a consultation with an attorney in your area and clarify). Suing is very costly so keep that in mind. Even if the defendant is in the wrong they aren't necessarily responsible for legal fees - in my state they would only be liable for fees if that was agreed to in a signed contract (not the case here) or written into a law (varies by state).", "NO it is not.  I sued someone in small claims court (I'm in Canada, if it matters) as a matter of principle almost 15 years ago.  I sued and won a judgement for $2000.
