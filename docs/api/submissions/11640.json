I was in a position where I could pay for her and for myself.\n\nI did everything, booked the hotels, and book tours. Before going to the actual trip, I did asked every family member if they were interested in joining in our Vietnam and Hong Kong trip. My younger brother said he wants to go. I did tell him that I am going to book everything because it is easier for us to make sure we have the same reservation and that he is to pay me back and he said he agreed. I also told him that he has to share the expenses of the trip as well, but I will pay for myself and our mom and he understood that too.\n\nWe went on a 23-day family vacation trip to Vietnam and Hong Kong, which total approximately $13,000 total. During the trip, I told him that since I don't need his part right away, he can pay me when I get accepted to Med or PA school. This was back in 2019.\n\nFast forward to 3 months ago, I approached him to ask him when he has the funds to pay me back. He lied straight to my face and said \"I already paid you.\" I said ok, can you show me a receipt that you paid me? I don't see it in my bank statement or email. Then he starts to yell at me saying \"I AINT PAYING YOU SH\\*T!\" He claims that since \"I don't do anything around the house,\" he owes me nothing, which is not true at all. I help out the house a lot and more than he knows. He didn't even bother to ask how much he even owes.\n\nDuring this argument, I told him that if he doesn't pay me then I will sue him. He said \"FINE GO AHEAD. I DONT CARE.\" 3-months have passed, I have been holding onto the complaint paperwork and all the receipts I have for our vacation trip just to see if his attitude towards me or towards the situation changes. But, it hasn't and I have had enough of it. What made crossed the line was that he continues to lie and refuses to take any responsibilities. I have bought a very expensive air fryer and I told him that if he wants to use it, this is how you take care of it (this was sent via text with my older siblings CCed on it). He refuses to do it, and then one day, it stopped working. I confronted him about it and he told me \"I DIDNT BREAK IT, I NEVER USED THE AIR FRYER.\" That is also a lie and this is when I realize that he will never take responsibility and will lie about it.\n\nSo, I have officially submit a complaint against him to pay me back for $3000 (less than 1/3 of the cost btw). I have always told our parents and siblings that he needs to go to counseling or therapy because he has issues that he needs to work out. If I do win the case, he can either pay me back for what he owes or he can agree to use what he owes me to go to counseling/therapy to workout whatever issues he needs to work out.\n\nAITA for reaching to this point and suing my younger brother for a family vacation that I paid for?\n\nEDIT:\n\nI do not have a written agreement. But I have receipts, invoices, bank statements, and credit card statements that shows everything I paid for. Some things, like the flight, cruise, and tours, has all of our names on it.", "created_utc": 1678121140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11k3xub/aita_for_suing_my_younger_brother_for_not_paying/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Weird brother to not be held accountable to a large sum like that. Wonder why no one is backing you up in a serious way. Then again, these family dynamics always have people staying on the sidelines not willing to provide actual help. If the fees are higher than what it is worth, I would scratch off the expense as a learned lesson and always warn people around him about his actions.", "Unless you two agreed in writing that he would pay you back a specific amount, I think you\u2019re out of luck. Your brother played you, and he\u2019s likely going to get away with it. I\u2019m sorry, OP. No good deed goes unpunished.\n\n\nI will say, though, that trying to force your brother into therapy would be just as much a waste of money. It\u2019d be like buying a gym membership for someone who has no intention of going to the gym. Therapy only works if you work with it.\n\n\nNta", "ESH.  Never lend money you can't afford to lose.", "ESH You should never book anything for anyone without cash in hand.

Therapy doesn't work that way.", "ESH\n\nYou should have written out a contract what the amount was and how long he would have to pay it.\n\nHe sucks for free loading.", "ESH - and THIS once again is why you never lend money to family.", "[removed]", "Sounds like you got all the responsibility in the family, leaving your brother with none.

His portion was a bit higher than that, but I decided some of the things I would just bear the cost for.", "He is 31-years old.", "You might be right unfortunately. He didn't even ask me once how much the trip was or how much he owes, so he doesn't even know how much this trip was...", "It looks like that way as a lesson learn. I really was trying to do something nice for everything, this was my mother first time out of the country since moving here to the States and young brother's first time out of the country ever.\n\nMy older brother is definitely on my side. My younger brother lived with my older brother and our sister-in-law for 6-months. He tried to lie and short-change them every opportunity that he got. For example, my older brother told him to pay a certain rent, he agreed, he went to my SIL and gave a check that was less than what was agreed on. \n\nAfter 6-months, my older brother and SIL kicked him out and now lives with our mother.", "That makes him foolish.

Asking for less introduces the idea that you had agreed to cover expenses incurred by him. This may not be \u2153 of $13,000, but if you have the receipts, use them to calculate an exact number.", "Ahhh I read it as less than 1/3 the cost of HIS portion. Following now.", "You are  NTA", "In your opinion, you don't think its worth to try to go to civil court/small claims court over it?", "Does your brother have $3k just lying around? If not, good luck getting a penny out of him.", "If you were to try and recover the money I would go to small claims court - the parties generally represent themselves without attorneys so you wouldn't have to foot that extra cost. However, most states cap recovery from small claims to $5,000 so just keep that in mind (but check your states laws because each one is different). \n\nIf you decide to sue civilly, this can take anywhere from months to a few years. Attorneys fees can add up very quickly (between $350/hr to $650/hr in my area). You can see if an attorney in your area would be wiling to take this case on a contingency basis - where you pay for the court/filing fees and in some cases don't have any legal fees unless your case prevails, but then the attorney gets 1/3rd of whatever money you're awarded (but these agreements differ attorney to attorney so you'd have to get a consultation with an attorney in your area and clarify). Suing is very costly so keep that in mind. Even if the defendant is in the wrong they aren't necessarily responsible for legal fees - in my state they would only be liable for fees if that was agreed to in a signed contract (not the case here) or written into a law (varies by state).", "NO it is not.  I sued someone in small claims court (I'm in Canada, if it matters) as a matter of principle almost 15 years ago.  I sued and won a judgement for $2000.  I have not seen one penny of that money, and on top of that it cost me like $400 and a bunch of my own free time to actually sue him.  1000% NOT WORTH IT.  Lesson learned on that one.", "I don't know how much money he has. He does have a job in IT support and works from home and lives with our mother. He doesn't pay rent or anything. He doesn't go out nor drive anywhere, and doesn't buy his own food. Basically, our mother still care of him despite him having a job.", "Yes - I do plan to do small claims court. If I win, I highly doubt he would be willingly and voluntarily pay what he owes still, does that mean I would have to go through and obtain a judgement still?", "Well, if you get a judgment against him you\u2019ll be able to take it to his company and have the money withheld from his wages.  A nice wake-up call for him.  Good luck!"]}
