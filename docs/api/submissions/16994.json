I see no difference as all got what they wanted, siblings with their college degrees and OP with his lavish vacation.

Very tit-for-tat.\n\nIt\u2019s an understandable response said in anger, but it doesn\u2019t make it a good one. Given that the OP is here asking about it, it seems he had the same thought.\n\nEdit: people seem to be missing the point. It is not disputing if student loans are predatory. The point is if you acknowledge that they\u2019re predatory, then the siblings were taken advantage of, ie they are *victims* of a predator, not \u201cirresponsible\u201d with their finances. And therefore, it\u2019s a bit shitty to dunk on them and gloat that they\u2019ll be paying off the predatory loans until they\u2019re old\u2026  even if they are assholes themselves and richly deserve some form of dressing down.", "Yeah. It is hard being the bigger person. The only thing you might apologize for is the remark about student loans.

If your Grandma and Uncles feel that you were right to defend yourself, I don't think an apology is warranted.

A lot of what you need to know for many individual contributor or management roles is taught on the job, btw, regardless of prior education.\n\nThere are obviously some jobs (CPA, for example) where a degree is required, but the main thing you missed from not going to college was a broad education in subjects like economics, statistics, and communications that wouldn't necessarily be relevant to you.\n\nThat said, not having a degree could limit your career options as you increase in seniority. If you're happy where you're at, settle in. Sounds like you have a good boss who likes you and trusts you. As long as you're both happy, enjoy it while it lasts.\n\nIf the company gets acquired, or if you want to relocate to a different metro area, your options may be limited, because most of the people you would be competing against for jobs elsewhere are likely to have degrees and may be given preferential consideration as a result.", "> I can do AP, AR, Job Setup/Costing, Payroll for field and Management side, Purchasing & Inventory, and management of our Fleet.

I say this a Mom who is still paying on the $30,000.00 parent plus loan that I took out for my daughter's college .  Because I kept paying on it during the COVID relief, I now only owe $13,000.  It took me 6 LONG years to get it paid down this far.

He is propositioning to me to start taking 2-3 classes a year. He said he'd help shoulder some of the costs if I do consider it.
