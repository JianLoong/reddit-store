Our ten and seven year olds are still in elementary. This kind of sucks, because the elementary school starts at 8:45 and the middle school started at 9:30, but the high school starts at 7:30. So now we all have to wake up earlier, but it is what it is.\n\nLast year I was in a carpool with another mom. We alternated taking our kids to the elementary school. On days that it was her turn, I didn't have to leave the house until it was time to take my oldest to school. Now though, I'm going to have to get up even earlier and take him to school. Since the elementary school and high school are closer to each other than they are to our house, is makes sense to leave with all the kids at the same time. Basically, the carpool no longer makes sense for me logistically.\n\nI told the other mom a month ago that the carpool wouldn't work for me this year. She wasn't happy and tried to convince me it was a bad idea to leave the carpool. She asked who would take the kids to school if myself or one of the kids was sick, and I said my husband. She kept arguing with me, but I took longer and longer between responses and one day I just didn't message her back at all. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nYesterday she texted me to say she wasn't able to make other arrangements, so unfortunately the carpool will need to continue for the first few weeks of school. I got frustrated and said no. I was pretty rude. I didn't buffer it with niceties at all. I just texted no. She's upset, and I'm pretty sure she's badmouthing me to all of our other mom friends. My husband even told me that one of his friends who is married to one of my friends asked him if I'm okay, so I know she is saying stuff behind my back.\n\nI want to defend myself to our friends, but I'm worried that maybe I really am the asshole? Am I obligated to continue the carpool even though it is no longer convenient for me? If I give my side of the story, will I just look worse? Since I had my fourth baby last year I've left the work force temporarily, and I know they all think I'm lazy and don't do anything all day. I think I shouldn't have to do the carpool, but maybe that's selfish?", "created_utc": 1691420729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15knali/aita_because_i_dont_want_to_carpool_anymore/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not your problem she can\u2019t find other arrangements.", "NTA\n\nIt takes two to carpool. You are out. She is on her own.", "Nta. carpool is absolutely not an obligation and she can\u2019t just tell you that you have no choice.", "NTA\n\nYou have to do what's right for your family. You gave her ample notice; it isn't your problem if she can't work it out. \n\nShe is 100% the AH.", ">Yesterday she texted me to say she wasn't able to make other arrangements, so unfortunately the carpool will need to continue for the first few weeks of school.\n\nUm, what?  NTA  No one can force you to carpool. It was convenient when your children all had similar schedules. It's not longer the case. It's really that simple.", "NTA. Carpools can be a good thing. But they don\u2019t last forever. I can remember several carpooling arrangements throughout my school years. None lasted more than 2-3 years. Why? Because circumstances change and maybe the arrangement no longer benefits everyone. That\u2019s life. You gave the other mom plenty of time to make other plans. It\u2019s not like you sprung this on her in the middle of the school year.", "People like this carpool mom make me extra glad I didn\u2019t have any kids. \n\nNTA. No means no.", "NTA- you're not obligated to do a carpool and you gave her plenty of notice that you weren't going to be doing the carpool anymore. It's not on you to fix her carpool issue.", "NTA. The carpool doesn't work for you anymore. Simple as that. She doesn't get to demand that you stay in a carpool with her. LOL the audacity of her to tell you what you will be doing... insane. Don't worry about the situation too much. Let her cause her drama, the true story will come forth and your other mom friends will see how crazy she is. You didn't so anything wrong! Just doing what works best for you and your family.", "NTA. Call your mutual friend and \"ask\" for her advice. Explain that you are making a very common carpool change now that your kids schedules have changed, you gave this mom two months notice and she's STILL hassling you. And apparently spreading rumors. If your friend is any good she'll spread the word on the situation.", "NTA, you gave her plenty of notice, I guess their car pool will be one person short, what makes her think she can find someone in another month if she couldn't in the last month. You have 4 kids to take care of, you have plenty to do and you are making more work for yourself, not sure how this is lazy, and any mother know that raising kids and keeping house is a job in itself.", "NTA\n\nYou informed her and thats the end of your obligation. Her bad mouthing you is out of your control, sadly.", "NTA. You are not the AH by any means. You told her it no longer works for your family. That should have been the end of it. It's not your obligation to solve her logistical issues. \n\nThe fact that she didn't take no for an answer, tried to tell you that you need to do it anyway and is badmouthing you, makes her the major AH (and immature and manipulative). \n\nI would text any friends you are close to and tell them what happened and ask them to please ignore whatever she says about you. Anyone who takes her side after hearing the truth is not a friend anyway. If someone says something to you or your husband, I would also tell them the truth in a casual, unaffected way to defend yourself but to also not add to the drama.", "NTA. No means no!", "NTA. You gave her plenty of notice. She decided that because she couldn't find another carpool that you were obligated to stay. No. That's not how it works.\n\nLet your friends know that you can't carpool and you gave her plenty of notice. You know it's inconvenient, but your circumstances have changed. She argued a lot, but you made it clear you wouldn't change your mind and refused to discuss it further. Then she tried to order you to continue the old carpool, which you refused. Let them know that you're worried about what she's been saying because your husband has heard some horrid abuse about you and you just want to clear the air.", "It\u2019s your decision, but I\u2019m confused your hs starts at 730, and your elementary kids at 845, but you\u2019re taking them all at once?", "NTA\n\nNot even close.\n\n*Maybe*, and only just maybe, if you were in the middle of the school year and just stopped the carpool with no notice, someone could say you were in the wrong.  But, as every parent knows, circumstances change between every school year and parents have to be willing to adjust.  What if you moved?  What if one of your kids got accepted into a magnet school and needed to go to a different location?  You gave her plenty of notification that the old arrangement no longer worked for you, and it was now on her to find a new carpool.  This wasn't a professional arrangement, there were no contracts... you were just two families helping out when the schedules made sense.\n\nNow that one of your kids has moved from middle to high school, your schedule and situation has totally changed and your needs no longer overlap hers.  You let her know, gave her plenty of warning, and she chose to do nothing about it.\n\nAnd, if she's bad mouthing you to friends because of that, then not only are you NTA, she, herself, becomes the AH!  I'm sure folks who are your true friends will understand why you needed to change your situation once you explain it.", "NTA. You gave her plenty of notice and you aren't obligated to stay in a situation that hurts you more than it helps you. Let her talk, at least then no one else will expect you to cart their child around.", "NTA. You aren't obligated in any way to car pool with this woman. She made the choice to have children, and she is responsible for their needs. You gave her ample warning to find alternative carpool options, but instead of looking for other options, she kept making it your problem. \n\nYou don't owe any of the other moms an explanation, but if you want to save face, go ahead and give your side of the story.", "NTA, car pool is not an obligation. The whole point is that it\u2019s convenient and helps both sides. It\u2019s not like you signed a contract to carpool. She\u2019d probably expect you to keep carpooling if you moved across town.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m just an outside observer, but, to me, if these women are talking shit about you behind your back, they have no leg to stand on.

Not all the time but as a peace offer until she gets it sorted.", "I can see that, but it might be nice for you to not have to do all 3, and to have a backup plan if you and your husband both had to be somewhere, but you\u2019re NTA good luck"]}
