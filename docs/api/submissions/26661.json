It's been nearly a month since he had had a good night's sleep. So naturally, he dozed off when the clock hit twelve. The following morning he was telling me how he feels bad for not wishing her at midnight. He did wish her in the morning as soon as he had woken but she was upset nevertheless. I told him that anyone who is close to him would know how tired he has been and would understand it and not hold it against him. I mean the same thing happened on my birthday last year. I figured he had slept and didn't make it a big deal. \n\n  \nAnyway, later that day she face-timed him and showed him all the gifts she had received the flowers she had gotten, and how special her friends had made her feel. My boyfriend who still was having a bad day wasn't able to send her any gifts or flowers. But he is planning to later this week though.   \nYesterday she had expressed how disappointed she felt due to my boyfriend not making any effort on her birthday. That she was upset he hadn't wished at 12, nor sent any flowers. How he had also not gone on a birthday trip with her like she wanted to. Overall she seemed very upset. \n\nWhen my boyfriend told me this today, I told him that she was acting a bit immature and should have understood how busy he was. He tried to defend her by saying anyone would be disappointed if their best friend didn't make any effort for their birthday. But I told him that both of them are adults with very real responsibilities and the best thing one can do is be understanding of one another's situation. He did wish her, and he did talk to her on her birthday but expecting to be there at 12 and send flowers at 12 seemed a bit much. He can always make up to her by sending gifts and I had suggested the same. \n\n  \nAnyway, my boyfriend kept defending her and told me that I was acting jealous and dismissive when I expressed this was just weird. I wasn't villainizing his best friend but only wanted to make sure my boyfriend didn't feel guilt trippy and it is biting me in the ass lol. So AITA for not being supportive when he was feeling bad and instead calling his best friend immature?", "created_utc": 1694449430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fzpdw/aita_for_calling_my_bfs_girl_bestfriend_immature/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sorry, but there's no such thing as girl 'bestfriend' for a man in a relationship. You gonna be very disappointed on the long term. The guy always ends up catching feelings for his 'friend' and most of the time he hides it due to fear od rejection. Everyone knows that. Honestly I'm just saving you from a headache. It's so weird. Imagine you're married to someone and when you have a conflict he goes to this 'friend' for advise or hangs out with her. I've been a relationship only once my whole life with a girl who has a guy 'bestfriend'. She was about 3 years older than me and he was in her uni. We lasted for months and she always seemed so interested in me. Next thing you know she's always defending him when I call him out for weird behaviour and threatening me. Out of nowhere, one day, she starts changing up her behaviour with me and becomes really dry with me for literally the last 2 months. She ends up blaming me for it and leaving me. Fast forward 2-3 weeks she's dating him (to no surprise) and with 0 shame she confessed to me that she felt 'a spark' with him while she was with me and that she 'felt bad'. I'm being really straightforward with you because I actually feel bad for you and I do not want you to feel surprised. Any man who is serious about a woman and sees marriage material in her would never befriend another girl like that. The more they hang out and chit-chat, the more feelings they'll develop. It's basic psychology. Boundaries are healthy in every relationship, and his situation ain't it.", "Nta op he\u2019s definently doing something with her", "Yooo", "[deleted]", "ESH You two need to break up.  That you just kept on and on, with him defending his friend and you keeping on and on.  You sound exhausting.  What possible difference could any of it have made to you?", "ESH. \n\nI do not think she is being immature, as best friends should go out of the way for each other's birthdays. However, she is being unreasonable, as he has a girlfriend, so his priorities have changed, and some things may seem like they are crossing the line. \n\nAs for you, well, you are being disingenuous.  You are jealous of the amount of attention your boyfriend is lavishing on another girl, and you are following the catty woman's guidebook: go after the woman, when it is the man you have the issue with, while pretending you are the cool, unbothered chick. \n\nIn addition, you may be his girlfriend, but no one likes it when you bash their friends and will rush to defend them. He did not feel that way, so let it go. No need to keep on doubling down and insisting, as that reveals the catty nature you are desperately trying to conceal.", "YTA. The 12am birthday wish thing is weird to me but I think its valid she was upset her *bestfriend* didn\u2019t get her anything for her bday.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t make an effort on your birthday or get you any flowers would you view this the same way? Would you chalk it up to him being busy and be okay with it because he has real responsibilities. He can always make it up to you by just getting some gifts at a later date.\n\nSmall amounts of effort matter imo. Takes 5 minute to order some flowers.", "ESH. Demanding birthday wishes be sent right at midnight is unreasonable. A birthday trip might or might not be reasonable depending on the circumstances. But expecting *something* from your best friend for your birthday is not unreasonable, and her expressing her disappointment is not weird. It's only natural for him to feel a bit guilty about not having sent a gift, and trying to alleviate that guilt by putting her down was a mistake.", "YTA\nIt's been two days.  If he was going to do something for her birthday by now, he would have.  She's allowed to be upset that he's pulling back from their friendship.\n\nDon't you think he should feel bad and do better when he messes up?  You don't need to make her look bad to make him feel better.  He can and should do that on his own by fixing things, not by throwing insults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My cousin does seem annoyed often, but they are always there for each other in good and bad times and are clearly close so she happily follows through her quirks. She always says that she herself has some flaws and quirks and her best friend accepts it. My cousin sometimes would not upload any special status on my bdays (  uploading WhatsApp status for b'day is a very big thing in my country) if she is busy or doing something else. We are very close too but  she knows I won't care and understand her situation in this matter. But there are some other matters about which I am sensitive about so she would do it for me, but her best friend doesn't care about that so it's fine if not extending same courtesy to her. \n\nYou are NTA obviously, as your point is right. No adults should care that much for bdays like this. But let it go. It's between them and how they manage it. If your bf doesn't have any problem with it then it's upto him.
