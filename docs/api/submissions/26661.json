It's been nearly a month since he had had a good night's sleep. So naturally, he dozed off when the clock hit twelve. The following morning he was telling me how he feels bad for not wishing her at midnight. He did wish her in the morning as soon as he had woken but she was upset nevertheless. I told him that anyone who is close to him would know how tired he has been and would understand it and not hold it against him. I mean the same thing happened on my birthday last year. I figured he had slept and didn't make it a big deal. \n\n  \nAnyway, later that day she face-timed him and showed him all the gifts she had received the flowers she had gotten, and how special her friends had made her feel. My boyfriend who still was having a bad day wasn't able to send her any gifts or flowers. But he is planning to later this week though.   \nYesterday she had expressed how disappointed she felt due to my boyfriend not making any effort on her birthday. That she was upset he hadn't wished at 12, nor sent any flowers. How he had also not gone on a birthday trip with her like she wanted to. Overall she seemed very upset. \n\nWhen my boyfriend told me this today, I told him that she was acting a bit immature and should have understood how busy he was. He tried to defend her by saying anyone would be disappointed if their best friend didn't make any effort for their birthday. But I told him that both of them are adults with very real responsibilities and the best thing one can do is be understanding of one another's situation. He did wish her, and he did talk to her on her birthday but expecting to be there at 12 and send flowers at 12 seemed a bit much. He can always make up to her by sending gifts and I had suggested the same. \n\n  \nAnyway, my boyfriend kept defending her and told me that I was acting jealous and dismissive when I expressed this was just weird. I wasn't villainizing his best friend but only wanted to make sure my boyfriend didn't feel guilt trippy and it is biting me in the ass lol. So AITA for not being supportive when he was feeling bad and instead calling his best friend immature?", "created_utc": 1694449430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fzpdw/aita_for_calling_my_bfs_girl_bestfriend_immature/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sorry, but there's no such thing as girl 'bestfriend' for a man in a relationship. You gonna be very disappointed on the long term. The guy always ends up catching feelings for his 'friend' and most of the time he hides it due to fear od rejection. Everyone knows that. Honestly I'm just saving you from a headache. It's so weird. Imagine you're married to someone and when you have a conflict he goes to this 'friend' for advise or hangs out with her. I've been a relationship only once my whole life with a girl who has a guy 'bestfriend'. She was about 3 years older than me and he was in her uni. We lasted for months and she always seemed so interested in me. Next thing you know she's always defending him when I call him out for weird behaviour and threatening me. Out of nowhere, one day, she starts changing up her behaviour with me and becomes really dry with me for literally the last 2 months. She ends up blaming me for it and leaving me. Fast forward 2-3 weeks she's dating him (to no surprise) and with 0 shame she confessed to me that she felt 'a spark' with him while she was with me and that she 'felt bad'. I'm being really straightforward with you because I actually feel bad for you and I do not want you to feel surprised. Any man who is serious about a woman and sees marriage material in her would never befriend another girl like that. The more they hang out and chit-chat, the more feelings they'll develop. It's basic psychology. Boundaries are healthy in every relationship, and his situation ain't it.", "Nta op he\u2019s definently doing something with her", "Yooo", "[deleted]", "ESH You two need to break up.  That you just kept on and on, with him defending his friend and you keeping on and on.  You sound exhausting.  What possible difference could any of it have made to you?", "ESH. \n\nI do not think she is being immature, as best friends should go out of the way for each other's birthdays. However, she is being unreasonable, as he has a girlfriend, so his priorities have changed, and some things may seem like they are crossing the line. \n\nAs for you, well, you are being disingenuous.  You are jealous of the amount of attention your boyfriend is lavishing on another girl, and you are following the catty woman's guidebook: go after the woman, when it is the man you have the issue with, while pretending you are the cool, unbothered chick. \n\nIn addition, you may be his girlfriend, but no one likes it when you bash their friends and will rush to defend them. He did not feel that way, so let it go. No need to keep on doubling down and insisting, as that reveals the catty nature you are desperately trying to conceal.", "YTA. The 12am birthday wish thing is weird to me but I think its valid she was upset her *bestfriend* didn\u2019t get her anything for her bday.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t make an effort on your birthday or get you any flowers would you view this the same way? Would you chalk it up to him being busy and be okay with it because he has real responsibilities. He can always make it up to you by just getting some gifts at a later date.\n\nSmall amounts of effort matter imo. Takes 5 minute to order some flowers.", "ESH. Demanding birthday wishes be sent right at midnight is unreasonable. A birthday trip might or might not be reasonable depending on the circumstances. But expecting *something* from your best friend for your birthday is not unreasonable, and her expressing her disappointment is not weird. It's only natural for him to feel a bit guilty about not having sent a gift, and trying to alleviate that guilt by putting her down was a mistake.", "YTA\nIt's been two days.  If he was going to do something for her birthday by now, he would have.  She's allowed to be upset that he's pulling back from their friendship.\n\nDon't you think he should feel bad and do better when he messes up?  You don't need to make her look bad to make him feel better.  He can and should do that on his own by fixing things, not by throwing insults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My cousin does seem annoyed often, but they are always there for each other in good and bad times and are clearly close so she happily follows through her quirks. She always says that she herself has some flaws and quirks and her best friend accepts it. My cousin sometimes would not upload any special status on my bdays (  uploading WhatsApp status for b'day is a very big thing in my country) if she is busy or doing something else. We are very close too but  she knows I won't care and understand her situation in this matter.

Im happy 4u then you are good but if he reacts badly? Well, that means that his bestfriend offers him benefits if you know what I mean.", "Nta, but I'm curious- What is he like for your birthday, celebrations, etc.?", "Nta.. Honey Idk how long ya'll have been together but I do not expect all of that from my Fianc\u00e9 and we been together for 8 years in November. She does need to be more understanding and your bf needs to learn boundaries because like others said this sounds like something he should be doing for you. .", "NTA\n\nYou're not wrong. She is immature and spoiled too. But here's the thing. It's one thing to say \"best friend's actions are unreasonable here\" but it's quite another to slap the immature label on her as a person. Again, I am not saying you were wrong, but that is probably why your boyfriend is reacting the way he is.", "Is this something cultural that I'm not aware of? I've never heard of someone expecting to be messaged or called immediately the start of the day of their birthday. I personally don't expect it. Any time that day is just fine.\n\nI also don't expect people to make a big deal of it now that I'm an adult. Just having someone call or text is fine. No need to send a card let alone a gift or taking a trip together. It honestly sounds like she's expecting to be treated like a girlfriend, not a regular friend.", "Someone had had the audacity to wish me a happy birthday at midnight and risk waking me up id be breathing fire.\n\nNTA, I think your response was sensible & correct. \nI think the friendship is a bit sus but that's from a stranger on the internet so take it with a grain of salt.", "Is she 12 to be mad about not being wished happy bday at midnight?  What the hell? I don't expect my own boyfriend or family to wish me happy bday at midnight Jesus. \n\n Why does she expect girlfriend treatment from *your* boyfriend? Why does *your* boyfriend put up with giving her girlfriend treatment? \n\nNTA. How long has she been in love with him? How long has he?", "When your bf started to say that you were jealous you should have told him that he was right, he was a shitty friend. And while he gaped like a fish you should have added: \"That's what you are asking me to say, you realise that don't you? I'm not jealous, I'm telling you that there's no reason for you to feel guilty.\"\n\nBut hindsight is always perfect. \n\nNTA. She is acting like a 12 years old.", "OP you are definitely NOT TA in this. I'm not so sure I'd call in immature, the way she was making him feel guilty screams more narcissistic tendencies to me, but I might very well be wrong, I'm no mental health expert. Like you said, anyone who is close to him would know how tired he's been and so on, and with that in mind, she's not his friend, she's just using him. I saw someone else comment he's been giving her the gf treatment, and maybe he doesn't realise he's been doing it, but maybe, just maybe, the supposed best friend is jealous of his relationship with you. I'd certainly keep your eye on her, something just isn't right there.", "NTA, but clearly this is one of those situations like insulting someone's family -- they can do it, but you're not allowed.\n\nHer behaviour is silly but it's not your job to point that out.", "Sounds like the kinda girl who would bed your guy just to have ammo and self fulfilment. I'd be careful if I were you.", "Your boyfriend is an idiot and this friend of his is a needy bellend", "INFO: Why is he giving her girlfriend treatment?", "NTA. My best friend misses my birthday every year and I get a text two days later with an apology, a dumb joke and a funny GIF. Adults have their own lives to live and it\u2019s embarrassing for her and your boyfriend that they are both acting like this. \n\nShe should grow up and your boyfriend should stop treating her like a girlfriend.", "NTA. And that is some high maintenance friend he has there. Obviously she has sat the expectation that this so how she is to be treated and if anyone fails, she pouts like a toddler. He\u2019s wrong for accusing you of being jealous.", "Are you sure they're not into each other? \n\nNTA", "Is your boyfriend her best friend, or does she say that to every friend privately so they give her special treatment? How many of the presents are from guys?\n\nTo me, this sounds like an attractive girl who has a lot of guy best friends who dote over her endlessly. Main character syndrome. Be honest; is your boyfriend more on the nerdy side?", "NTA but something I leaned a long time ago is to not shit on your partner's situation, even when they are complaining. So if my husband complains about work, I don't add my complaints about his idiotic boss, lack of recognition, etc. Because it doesn't help and it just adds more mad feelings. Plus it puts people on the defensive. In this situation you could have said \"you did the best you could, hopefully she'll see that.\" Supportive without shitting. \n\nThat being said, the friend sounds fucking exhausting.", "Girl he's in a relationship with someone and it ain't you...", "INFO: how long have they been friends? have these things been longs standing traditions for the two of them", "NTA.", "Uhh your boyfriend is being manipulated by a 26 year old woman with the maturity of a toddler\u2026hope you figure things out with this one. I have no words.\n\nMy best friend I have known since kindergarten don\u2019t even wish each other a happy birthday at midnight. (We have gone thru the same school our whole lives, never fought, same sports team, our gfs are sisters, etc\u2026)", "NTA. You seriously need to rethink this relationship. One of the things I've learned from Reddit is no opposite sex best friends. It rarely works out and seems to often lead to cheating.", "none of those things are necessarily romantic, they're probably just their traditions. Redditors be normal about male female friendships challenge impossible", "Or maybe he IS her puppy.", "Why not?", "Such an immature take", "why can't redditors understand that some people are close with their friends", "This needs more up votes! So spot on.", ">but yall must have different concepts of what a best friend is.\n\nand that's why i haven't said anything else about it", "i still think it is immature because i hadn't seen that reaction with anyone else. i NEVER bad mouthed his friends before this but he is allowed to talk about my friends if they are in wrong so if i don't see why i couldn't point it out this time", "he always gets me bigger bouquets than he does for friends, nice jewelry, takes me out on a nice date", "we have been together for two years and they have known eachother for 4 years", "not a cultural thing, just a highschool thing", "she presumably expects the best friend treatment she has gotten from her best friend since presumably longer than OP and her boyfriend have been dating.", "he points it out when my friends do something dumb though", "some people think it's ok and normal to buy flowers for friends on occasions because it's chivalrous so i dont want to be controlling", "Not OP but these are probably just traditions they've had as long as they've been friends, no reason to categorize it as something it's not", ">\"you did the best you could, hopefully she'll see that.\n\nthat's what i said at first. that i was sure she wouldn't make him feel guilty when he had genuine reasons. but then she threw a tantrum and i didn't think she was being reasonable\n\ninteresting perspective. when i m complaining i want my bf to join me and shit on the situation lol. i only hate it when he tries to advice me or solves my problems.", "4 years and yes", "It's absolutely inappropriate", "Honey, you're supposed to be his GIRLFRIEND. When exactly do you think it's your place to say something? If you and he are in an exclusive, committed relationship and he starts treating another woman like his girlfriend, of course it's absolutely \"your place\" to call it out. And leave, as well, if it doesn't stop.\n\nDon't think so little of yourself that you believe it's not \"your place\" to expect basic, decent treatment. You are worth so much more than being a mouse while your bf and his \"other girlfriend\" disrespect you like this  right in front of your face.", "It\u2019s weird af unless he does this with all of his friends on their birthday. If he just does it for her (and I hope for you)\u2026weird af.", "It's totally your place. You're his girlfriend", "So he doesnt call you at 12 am to wish you a happy birthday? And shes mad he didnt go on a birthday trip with her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWere you invited on this trip? honestly, sounds like your boyfriend has 2 girlfriends.. im assuming she is married?", "Because usually a *woman best friend* means that there's at least some semblance of feelings from either part. Same as with *female friend*.\n\nNot to be confused with a *best friend who happens to be a woman* or a *friend who happens to be a woman* which means normal friendship between two people. As in, neither one of them acts like in a relationship with each other or get jealous when the other one is dating someone.", "close friendship, you should try it sometimes. Probably a tradition they have", "Yeah, but you wouldn't drop it, and that's his best friend", "Huh - okay. Then this is truly way over the top on her part. You're fine. She definitely sounds way spoiled. Time to explain how the real world works.", "Gonna have to say YTA then, traditions mean a LOT to some people and if this is breaking a 4 year streak it makes sense that your partner would feel bad. While it's a tough situation I'd imagine the best friend probably can't help but feel hurt that he put work before their friendship. Even if she knows that illogical it doesn't change that it still hurts. Your partner sounds like a good friend, I'm glad they have each other as some people rely very deeply on their friends. I don't think what you did was unforgivable as no one wants to see their partner feeling down on themselves, but maybe apologize for diminishing the importance of these traditions in their friendship", "some people would say i m controlling if i do though, that i don't respect their friendship", "he does do it with friends who he is close with", "he does. yes her other frriends cancelled on the trip as well so she's bummed\n\nshe's not married", "It's ridiculous to assume that is what u/lady_rain_was_here was referring to.\n\nIt's also ridiculous to argue you can tell which type a friendship is based on what words they use to refer to the friend with.", "I almost didn't comment on this as I didn't want to put ideas in OP's head but as a man with a woman best friend I could not agree more, I think it's often a justification used when you're a little closer than you're perhaps meant to be. I couldn't date anyone and keep them both, I'm not an A-hole who'd do that but truth is a partner wouldn't be able to compete if I did. OP's defensive reaction over his best friend's rather emotional response is exactly the kind of thing I think I'd be up against if I did. I hope I'm wrong but that's certainly where the mind went", "I mean, op is the one calling out her gender. It doesn't mean anything about how their relationship actually is", "Tbf if I take Reddit posts at face value, you can figure it out by language. *Girl best friend* means exactly what I said, since they see the girl before the best friend. Same with *boy best friend*.", "Yeah...like a trip for the two of them. Not a big group party or one with OP.", "I missed the birthday trip part. Where do you see it?", "He also went to visit her alone a month ago and the \"best friend\" wants him to visit again to take her out on a date.", "no she had planned a trip with another friend but that fell through so she invited my bf. he wouldn't have gone he said but i still found it weird to invite someone alone for a weekend getaway", "u/lady_rain_was_here was the person I replied to, stating never to start a relationship with a guy with a \"woman as a best friend,\" so I don't think your logic even applies. \n\nSecond, in the actual AITA post, the only person whose words we see is OP, i.e. we cannot judge how the bf refers to his best friend.\n\nLook, I agree that there is a difference between a guy having a best friend that is a woman, and a guy and a woman being in a relationship in all but the relations part. But to argue that someone can assess that simply from the words people use is not fair.\n\nIf you asked me am I having an affair, and I said no, believe me - to the extent you ever could. If you asked and I said \"I'm not not having an affair,\" even though the words mean the same thing, I chose those ones for a reason.\n\nBut to say that a guy has to say \"best friend who happens to be a woman\" every time or else they love each other is just not going to be right.\n\nOn top of that, u/lady_rain_was_here said don't date, and reiterated don't i.e. never. Can you honestly say that the reason they say that is because of the argument you pose?", "Last line of the second paragraph.", "Wow. My hair color is showing today... lol Thank you!", "No problem. I just had mine colored  the other day so  maybe that's what's helping me see better. :)"]}
