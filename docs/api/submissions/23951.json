I've had to stay at home and rest for a bit while the extraction sites heal. I hadn't left home since the surgery. Everything was going well until I noticed my grandma developed a severe cough. Soon enough, I started to exhibit the same cough alongside a runny nose.\n\nWhen my aunt invited me to a gathering, I said I had to decline because I think I caught something from my grandma. I thought this context was relevant because I hadn't gone out of the house since the surgery, so I didn't want my sickness to seem as miraculous/serious. Upon seeing this, my aunt calls me immature for blaming my grandma. She said this was an irresponsible attitude to have.\n\nI didn't have any ill intent in explaining how I got sick, like I said, I just thought it was something to include since I haven't left the house.

How is that immature?", "Your grandmother was sick.  Your grandmother was in the house around you.  You got sick.

She's the one who is immature. You of course did the responsible thing.", "LOL. NTA.\n\nDoes your aunt think illness just spontaneously develops from nothing, or that when one person catches an illness from another, the contagious person was \"to blame\" for it?\n\nSuper duper victim blamey, haha. BOTH you and your grandma were victims of a contagious illness. Your grandma's symptoms started first. You never left the house during recovery so chances are you caught it from her.
