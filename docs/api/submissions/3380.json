You need to make a life in a situation where you can have some financial independence.", "NTA - you're right, he made a power play.

If he's taking away supporting documentation for a visa over an argument, why are you even with him?

You really just need your passport, but they can look you up in the system if you have one or lost it. Also pay a fee.\n\nThat entirely depends on where you are, what passport you hold, where you're visiting, and how long you want to visit for... but no; for many it is \\*NOT\\* that easy.", "**And** they scrutinize marriages very closely for those green card applications... you have to have been together for a significant amount of time, and be able to provide all sorts of evidence that your marriage is a real one and not just a sham to get a green card.", "Then she got her documents back to apply for Canada. So she got them back.\n\nWhich canada paperwork is longer and you need fingerprints for it. So she did all this without her husband knowing.\n\nI don't believe this at all", "Not *her* documents. His supporting documents of her application, like a letter saying she's his wife and we're visiting for XYZ reason.", "[removed]", "Maybe he hasn't given her accurate information in order to control her then as surely he would know that. Whereas a foreign national likely won't have such a good understanding of immigration rules.", "She would have to know if she got to the interview process. The paperwork you file states what you need\n\nThe paperwork is first and it needs a signature, so she had to see it at one point\n\nThis doesn't make sense", "There's an interview process for a visit visa but no supporting docs needed? What a nightmare of a system.", "You need your passport, which is your supporting document.\n\nJust like it a USA citizen went to Europe, it is your passport and some paperwork. Like when you are leaving and stuff\n\nBut if she applied to Canada than she got her passport back", "I don\u2019t think you understand how this works at all. If you say it\u2019s easy to get visit visa then you don\u2019t know it completely. It is extremely hard to get USA visit visa coming from certain countries. You not only need passport you need to prove intent to Return and not stay in USA working illegally or to marry or do crimes. \n\n\nSo although you Can come with just passport, visa application confirmation page etc you need to provide supporting documents - bank statements with good amount of money, salary statements, employer letter that he gives you time off, ownership or property or cars etc. \nSo my supporting documents were including various papers stating that this is my husband, this is why and where we live in Middle East, his salary statements, letter from his company, his statement to cover USA trip expenses etc. \n\nHe didn\u2019t take my passport. I really don\u2019t think you have any idea how this works for 3rd world countries citizens.\n\n\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html"]}
