Because of this incident, you should carefully make an exit plan in case your husband tries to sabotage you again. Slava Ukraina <3", "NTA.  Give your husband no warning and *leave*.  Divorce him later, once you're safely in Canada.  The program that accepted you will probably have resources to help you adjust to Canadian weather, and can likely also connect you to resources for ending abusive relationships.", "NTA\n\n be careful of this man, he may be trying to isolate and control you. It could be why he went to a place where you would need his permission.\n\nGo to Canada and work hard, and make a good life for yourself. DO NOT ADD your husband to your bank accounts there!!!\n\nMake sure you have a network of friends and family that you can talk to. Don't ever suffer in silence or in secret.", "He\u2019s flying the red flags, OP! You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA\n\nyour husband is trying to control you using your visa status and other things. he's got you staying in the middle east where women have less rights and have to depend on a man for permission to do simple things like open a bank account.\n\nhe doesn't want you to come to the US or go to Canada because you will have more rights there and he won't be able to control you so easily. be careful, and secure your safety once you get to canada so that he cannot take your documents away again.", "NTA. Leave your husband, get divorce, go to Canada, stay there and be happy.\n\nPD: Your husband is probably hiding something that You can discover if you go to USA. .", "Fights happen but this level of denial is unacceptable. What did you do to raise much fury in him? Does he think you're using him for visa access ?", "NTA\u2026but he is definitely one. Was his plan to just leave you alone in the Middle East when he went home to visit? Who does that?", " NTA, As a Canadian welcome, and I hope you enjoy it here. If you want any ideas on fun things to do or places to visit let me know!", "NTA, but be very careful in how you go about leaving so he doesn't stop you/ withhold your passport", "NTA.", "NTA get away from him.", "OMG you won the lottery!

Your husband is though. He\u2019s controlling and abusive.", "NTA. Go to Canada and stay away from this man. Taking your documents is just the start. It won\u2019t get better.", "You rock! NTA", "NTA\n\nHe took your documents?\n\nTime to find a non-abusive spouse.", "NTA. Good luck!", "Go for it. Canada is awesome. And there's universal healthcare! Moved here from California when I was a kid.  \n\n\nIf he really planned on you becoming an American citizen, he'd want you to go there, want you to be learning what's required for the citizenship test, etc. Pretty sure he's gaslighting you, because it doesn't sound like he's helping you get citizenship at all.

This is an opportune time since Canada is letting a lot of Ukrainian citizens come here because of the war and I suspect there will be ways to allow you to stay.", "NTA at all. Go to Canada and get away from this man. He won't be able to try to apply for you again for a permanent visa to the US as he'd already had an application for visit visa and pulled the supporting documents. His and your name (together) are already in the system and are now red flagged. Time to divorce and move on and you'll be better off without him as his behavior would be way worse once he got you in the states for good.", "He literally tried to trap you like he owns you.

He\u2019s trying to control and manipulate you. Please take the opportunity and leave him. Don\u2019t let a USA visa be his power chip\u2014it seriously isn\u2019t that great over here. Good luck and hopefully good riddance.", "GIRL RUN AWAYgo to the ukranian consulate and try to go from there to Canada but dont stay one more second with him.

This is super controlling and abusive behavior", "nta. please please make it to canada!", "Go for it!", "NTA. \n\nDo it, come to Canada. There are large Ukrainian communities here (largest Ukrainian population outside Ukraine). \n\nWhat your husband is doing to you is abuse.

It is apparently similar in bleak flatness and freezing cold winters plus an affinity for growing wheat.   My mother left as soon as possible and ended up in Southern California eventually.   But it beats being stuck in the middle East with a husband who steals and hides your personal documents and denies you the chance to get a Visa.  NTA", "Please leave as soon as possible. This is all incredibly concerning behaviour. You need to get ahold of all your documents and leave.", "HUGE kudos to you for not waiting around and immediately making the application for Canadian documents. So many women on here have trouble taking those steps unless something incredibly drastic has happened and wouldn\u2019t have been able to act so decisively in the moment. Plenty of other people here have laid out what a huge issue his actions are and why, I\u2019m not going to rehash it. Take this exit ticket and make a new life for yourself in Canada.
