You don\u2019t know the colleagues or her daughter.   \n Go ahead, call it off. Go spend your graduation party with your friends or classmates outside. Your mom can decide where she stands.", "NTA.  A combined party for such unrelated events is a terrible idea.  Tell your mother a firm No.", "Your mom's saying that you're being a selfish person, yet:  \na) it's **your** graduation  \nb) you don't even know the lady AND the kid(s) that their birthday party is being \"shared\" with  \nc) you're being forced into something you don't want to do as it clashes with an event of some fair importance\n\nYou're absolutely NTA, and your mum is absolutely **THE** asshole for even downplaying your achievements and celebration that you've taken a fair amount of time to plan out.", "NTA. Just go hang out with your friends somewhere else. Your mom doesn't want to give you the party to celebrate your achievements. She doesn't deserve to be part of your celebration.", "NTA. This woman is rude and invasive. And your mother would be insensitive and inconsiderate if she let this happen.", "NTA - Who wants their 7 year old to \"party\" with a bunch of adults they do not know? The 7yo would be happier playing with her friends; are there going to be other kids her age their? Do you have a play gym or games for the 7yo? I'm assuming you early to mid 20s and the party will be generally child free as kids and college are difficult to balance.\n\nIm floored at why this woman thought it would be a good idea to try and make this a kids party also. \n\nIs this person very important to your mom, like her boss?? I'm surprised she does not have concencers about the massive age gap between you and the child. Or that this is a really important accomplishment for you.", "NTA. It's highly inappropriate for this woman to try to move her daughter's party into yours. Do you have a friend whose house you can have your party at? Or is there a public park where you can reserve a picnic site? Your mother is not being reasonable.", "NTA.\n\nContact your friends and tell them the party is moving. Even if its just lunch or whatever. Let any family expecting to celebrate YOU and not some random child that you are moving the party to xyz because none of them signed up for a 7 year old's party and that you understand if they can no longer make it, yadda yadda and THEN let your mother know plans have changed and she can just deal with the fallout. \n\nWanting your party to be about you isn't selfish. Its YOUR party and its not your fault this poor child's mother is lazy af. \n\nStart calling restaurants asap and check their outside food policy as it applies to cake(some will ok it some won't)", "NTA \u2014 Congratulations on your recent feats! Can you scout another venue?", "NTA. This sucks. Why should you share your graduation party with one of your mom's coworker's kids??? That makes no sense. Sorry OP. Hopefully, your mom will see reason here.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s YOUR party. This woman you barely even know wants to invite a bunch of little kids to YOUR house??? Ridiculous", "NTA. This woman is nuts to completely sweep in and take over your party. You don't even know this person! You absolutely deserve to be celebrated! Congrats on this milestone!\n\nMeanwhile, my sisters 15th birthday and my HS graduation were a merged party, which I  was totally fine with because: 1) clearly my sister and I knew each other 2) we are 2 years apart not 10+ years apart 3) we had family/friends in town from another state that weekend so it was nice for us both to get to celebrate with them. We each had our own cake and part of the decor. Edit: we had a say in the plans. That's the most important part!\n\nIn your situation 1) you don't know this kid or even this coworker 2) you have nothing in common with what a 7 year old would like to do at a party 3) you have no family or friends  in common. There is NO reason for your party to be merged with a 7 year old's except to make life easier for coworker.", "NTA - as a suggestion OP maybe consider sharing your special day with a bff or a small group get together since there's so many other events going on that month and make it a large celebration and then if your mom and other family wants to come then fine.  If not, then they lose out.  Otherwise just let them know it's not going to be a kid's b-day party.  You've missed out too much already all these years and you're going to have to finally keep celebrating your achievements from here on out since your family doesn't seem to have ever done it before.", "NTA: but what is wrong with your mom? Like this isn\u2019t a natural thing to combo. Why didn\u2019t she immediately say no and given propose this option to you. Sounds like the coworker just wants to use your moms house as party location. But your mom shouldn\u2019t have even brought this to you. \n\nMy advice here is to cancel the party and have a night at a cheap fun bar with your friends. Tell your mom she can host the kid\u2019s birthday party on that day and that you\u2019ll be at XXX bar with friends and any relatives that are any to join. \n\nYTA to both the mom and coworker.", "NTA. First, congratulations. Second, this is extremely rude of her, especially since you barely know her.  Does she plan to contribute anything other than cake and decor for her daughter?  It\u2019s your party, it *should* be all about you.  The audacity of some people!", "You've achieved a major milestone in your life that deserves to be celebrated. This is a big accomplishment and nothing else should be celebrated with this. What an assuming rude woman this coworker is. She wants to take over your party for her kid? NO WAY. You are NTA. Your mother is a big a$$hole for even considering this. Congratulations on your graduation! Go do something with your friends who know what it means. I'm sorrry your mother is being so stupid.", "The co-worker should decline the invite and send you a gift if she had planned to have her daughters party the same day. What world does this random coworker live in to ask to have her daughters birthday party at your graduation party. It\u2019s a ridiculous your mother is going along with this charade. It\u2019s not even family, even then it would be pushing it and I\u2019d still say no.", "NTA\n\nThis was a weird ask from your mom. You should ask her why she is having a hard time imagining celebrating your graduation. She clearly doesn\u2019t want to celebrate this big milestone of yours. If she had any interest in actually celebrating your college graduation then it would have never occurred to merge the party with a 7th birthday. It\u2019s time to set a very firm boundary here about what that party will be and who\u2019s invited. Your mom\u2019s  and 7y/o birthday girls should not be on that list. Your mom gets no say here.\n\nAlso that poor kid! I can\u2019t imagine the child or the child\u2019s parent wanting this. A kid should celebrate her 7th birthday with her own family and friends, not be shoved into a grown-up\u2019s graduation party. That is such an absurd scenario that I have a hard time believing that the child or the child\u2019s family had any part in this suggestion. That\u2019s probably why the woman hasn\u2019t contacted you. This is all about your mom.\n\nEdit to add/ highlight that if the party is at your house then it is YOUR party. So don\u2019t say you can\u2019t have it. You can always have your own party at your own house. You don\u2019t even have to invite your mom.", "NTA.\n\nThat's just plain weird, and your mother should have nipped it when her coworker brought it up.\n\nAnd yes, you do want everything to be about you.   It's your graduation party, it's *supposed* to be about you, not some random child you don't know.\n\nAnd honestly, if your college friends are coming, a lot of the parents might not be comfortable either, especially if there might be alcohol present.", "NTA- this is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

You'd rather spend it with ppl who give a rats ass about you. She cares more about pleasing other ppl. \n\nGoing LC for awhile with her might give her some perspective.

I would tell your mom if she won't cancel the kid going to your celebration you will do it somewhere else. The only person being selfish is your mom and her random coworker. \n\nWho even suggests that? Kind of seems like she wants to save money by piggy backing off your graduation party.
