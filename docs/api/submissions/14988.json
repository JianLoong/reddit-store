Tell your mother a firm No.", "Your mom's saying that you're being a selfish person, yet:  \na) it's **your** graduation  \nb) you don't even know the lady AND the kid(s) that their birthday party is being \"shared\" with  \nc) you're being forced into something you don't want to do as it clashes with an event of some fair importance\n\nYou're absolutely NTA, and your mum is absolutely **THE** asshole for even downplaying your achievements and celebration that you've taken a fair amount of time to plan out.", "NTA.

The 7yo would be happier playing with her friends; are there going to be other kids her age their? Do you have a play gym or games for the 7yo? I'm assuming you early to mid 20s and the party will be generally child free as kids and college are difficult to balance.\n\nIm floored at why this woman thought it would be a good idea to try and make this a kids party also. \n\nIs this person very important to your mom, like her boss?? I'm surprised she does not have concencers about the massive age gap between you and the child. Or that this is a really important accomplishment for you.", "NTA.

Even if its just lunch or whatever. Let any family expecting to celebrate YOU and not some random child that you are moving the party to xyz because none of them signed up for a 7 year old's party and that you understand if they can no longer make it, yadda yadda and THEN let your mother know plans have changed and she can just deal with the fallout. \n\nWanting your party to be about you isn't selfish.

This woman is nuts to completely sweep in and take over your party. You don't even know this person! You absolutely deserve to be celebrated! Congrats on this milestone!\n\nMeanwhile, my sisters 15th birthday and my HS graduation were a merged party, which I  was totally fine with because: 1) clearly my sister and I knew each other 2) we are 2 years apart not 10+ years apart 3) we had family/friends in town from another state that weekend so it was nice for us both to get to celebrate with them. We each had our own cake and part of the decor. Edit: we had a say in the plans. That's the most important part!\n\nIn your situation 1) you don't know this kid or even this coworker 2) you have nothing in common with what a 7 year old would like to do at a party 3) you have no family or friends  in common. There is NO reason for your party to be merged with a 7 year old's except to make life easier for coworker.", "NTA - as a suggestion OP maybe consider sharing your special day with a bff or a small group get together since there's so many other events going on that month and make it a large celebration and then if your mom and other family wants to come then fine.  If not, then they lose out.  Otherwise just let them know it's not going to be a kid's b-day party.  You've missed out too much already all these years and you're going to have to finally keep celebrating your achievements from here on out since your family doesn't seem to have ever done it before.", "NTA: but what is wrong with your mom? Like this isn\u2019t a natural thing to combo. Why didn\u2019t she immediately say no and given propose this option to you. Sounds like the coworker just wants to use your moms house as party location. But your mom shouldn\u2019t have even brought this to you. \n\nMy advice here is to cancel the party and have a night at a cheap fun bar with your friends. Tell your mom she can host the kid\u2019s birthday party on that day and that you\u2019ll be at XXX bar with friends and any relatives that are any to join. \n\nYTA to both the mom and coworker.", "NTA. First, congratulations. Second, this is extremely rude of her, especially since you barely know her.  Does she plan to contribute anything other than cake and decor for her daughter?

This is a big accomplishment and nothing else should be celebrated with this. What an assuming rude woman this coworker is. She wants to take over your party for her kid? NO WAY. You are NTA.

I'm sorrry your mother is being so stupid.", "The co-worker should decline the invite and send you a gift if she had planned to have her daughters party the same day. What world does this random coworker live in to ask to have her daughters birthday party at your graduation party. It\u2019s a ridiculous your mother is going along with this charade. It\u2019s not even family, even then it would be pushing it and I\u2019d still say no.", "NTA\n\nThis was a weird ask from your mom. You should ask her why she is having a hard time imagining celebrating your graduation. She clearly doesn\u2019t want to celebrate this big milestone of yours. If she had any interest in actually celebrating your college graduation then it would have never occurred to merge the party with a 7th birthday. It\u2019s time to set a very firm boundary here about what that party will be and who\u2019s invited. Your mom\u2019s  and 7y/o birthday girls should not be on that list. Your mom gets no say here.\n\nAlso that poor kid! I can\u2019t imagine the child or the child\u2019s parent wanting this. A kid should celebrate her 7th birthday with her own family and friends, not be shoved into a grown-up\u2019s graduation party. That is such an absurd scenario that I have a hard time believing that the child or the child\u2019s family had any part in this suggestion. That\u2019s probably why the woman hasn\u2019t contacted you. This is all about your mom.\n\nEdit to add/ highlight that if the party is at your house then it is YOUR party. So don\u2019t say you can\u2019t have it. You can always have your own party at your own house. You don\u2019t even have to invite your mom.", "NTA.\n\nThat's just plain weird, and your mother should have nipped it when her coworker brought it up.\n\nAnd yes, you do want everything to be about you.   It's your graduation party, it's *supposed* to be about you, not some random child you don't know.\n\nAnd honestly, if your college friends are coming, a lot of the parents might not be comfortable either, especially if there might be alcohol present.", "NTA- this is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

Then your mom can just independently and weirdly be hosting a birthday party for a child who is entirely unconnected to her, in front of her coworkers who were expecting to congratulate her daughter on an achievement.", "I think that the advice of talking to your mom one last time and letting her choose between having your grad party solely or having some random kids bd party is the way to go. Give her the 24-48 hour time limit for her decision but let her know it's one or the other but will NOT be both. If she chooses not to choose or doubles down on trying to guilt you into doing the joint party go ahead and reach out to other family members or friends who may be able to help you out by letting you have your party at their place or know of somewhere you can. Then send out mass texts or calls to all your family that you want to come and let them know that the party being held at your mom's house is a birthday party for her coworkers 7 yo daughter and if they would like to go to YOUR party then they should show up at x place on y date at z time. I personally would then start distancing myself from the mom. \n\nCongratulations on your graduation!! \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f\n\nEta: The other bit of advice I have would be then that if you have no other options for an alternative would be to tell your mom how you truly feel about what this party that was supposed to be for you turned into and that now since she wants to do this rando kids bd party then that's what this party is now all about and for. Then I would send out a mass text to all your family to let them know that your grad party has been canceled and that the party is now a 7th bd party for some rando your mom works with. Then just plan a hang party with your friends. It could even be something as simple as a BYOB bonfire for example.", "Firstly,  congratulations OP on your graduation.  That is a massive achievement and I hope you are super proud of yourself.  My suggestion, as others have said, cancel the party and go out with your friends. Your mum needs to grow a backbone and support YOU.\n\nYou are NTA.\nYour mother and her leach friend are massive AHs", "NTA. Your mom and her friend are bonkers. If you can't convince them not to do this, can you do it at a park or a restaurant?", "If her mother keeps putting other people not even close above op and lie to op the relationship is over as op can't trust the mother. Wheather op makes it official or not the situation is the same.", "Great idea. Then mom can look like the fool trying to explain how she chose to host a birthday party for an unknown kid instead of a graduation party for her own daughter.", "Being a human who has relationships with other humans means having complex relationships where you\u2019re going to be hurtful and in turn get your feelings hurt eventually. This is literally just one example. Not arguing with the situation. Ops mom is the AH. But your original comment lays out a game plan which culminates in a dramatic ending without room for discussion which frankly isn\u2019t warranted unless op has more examples and is making that decision for themselves.", "You re right but at some point after it happened over and over you are tired of being hurt and just distance yourself from that person so she/he can't hurt you anymore", "NTA.\nI don't need to read the story to understand what's going on here now that child doesn't deserve to share the party with you it's your graduation party not the child", "NTA. At first I thought it was your sibling's birthday and not even then you'd be the AH for not wanting to share the party. This is a stranger's child and your mom shouldn't call you selfish.", "Call that woman and just tell her, basically throw your mum in front of the bus. \n\nMaybe she doesn't even know. Also remind her that there will be booze and inappropriate music. Not the place for a kids party", "Because I'm an asshole, here is what I would do.  I would plan my party, I would hire some strippers and have them dressed as clowns.  I would let the strippers know once they got there to not disrobe and reveal anything a child shouldn't see cause you have to keep it legal.  I'm sure once the strippers started doing their thing, the kids party will leave and no  one will want to share a party again with you :)", "NTA. its your graduation and should be about you", "The petty in me would just plan another party elsewhere and let my friends and family (but not mom) know the change in plans and why. OR I would plot with my friends and get a keg or two and stock a full bar, turn on the heavy metal music (very loud, mind you!) and start partying like there is no tomorrow!  Make it as inappropriate as possible and make sure to start early so it's in full swing by the time the 7 year olds and your mom's coworkers arrive.  Have cars parked everywhere (including the lawn) so the birthday party can't be moved somewhere else.  \n\nMom knows exactly what she is doing - why else would she demand OP to stop \"being selfish and share the day\"?  She knows EXACTLY what she is doing is wrong but does not care, so why should OP care about her or her hurt feelings?\n\nThe appropriate thing to do would be to just plan the party elsewhere, enjoy yourself and move on with your life.  Time to move out (if you haven't already) and live your best life without mommy dearest.  AND I would ignore your mom until she apologizes for this nonsense (not that I expect she will - people-pleasers only care how they look to others, outside of their families).\n\nYou don't need people like that in your life - your parents should support you not expect you to let others walk all over you so they can look good.

Camping, picnic, BBQ, bowling, cinema, anything you want to do to celebrate. Get a table for you and a couple friends at a nice place if you have the money instead. Make some nice memories. Eat some nice food. It's YOUR celebration, after all.", "NTA. You should show your mom this post and replies from people. Maybe she'll realise that she's the one being selfish with how she's trying to make a party celebrating your accomplishment into something different. Or if she's under pressure from the coworker, maybe she'll release just how much the coworker is selfish with trying to push herself and her child into another person's party. I mean, what kind of person does that, ughh.\n\nShe should not give into that, she should say to the coworker that the party is for you, people coming are your family and friends, the party is for grownups, and if she can't come as just a guest, then too bad, but you all hope she and her daughter have a lovely birthday party... at their place. \n\nIf nothing works on your mom, then you should be sure that there is nothing selfish in not wanting to share this day. Tell your mom she just chose to celebrate with another kid instead of her own, and your party is cancelled. \nLike many people already sad, have the party with your friends somewhere else. If you can't afford a venue, just be outside. A park, a potluck, you can make it work even without  spending a lot. \n\nAlso, congratulations on your graduation, and I hope you have a great day despite all of this.", "I would plan a separate party with your friends.

If your mom is not willing to talk to her friend, just cancel and go out with your friends.\n\nThis sounds mean, but screw your mom's coworker and screw her kid - your grad party should be about YOU and YOUR accomplishment.

I would just cancel it, because this is ridiculous.", "OP, congratulations! Have a big hug from a random Reddit mom. \n\nNTA. Please sit your mom down and explain that you don't want a combined party. Explain why. If she insists, then you do what you want on your day.

On top of that, a kid you don't even know.", "NTA,\n\nYou don't know the women nor her daughter and they don't know any of your friends nor you also who tf invites their coworkers to their kids graduation party?\n\nAnd it's a stupid idea to lay two events like that together which have neither similarities, nor a relation or share an audience.\n\nHonestly this sounds just really weird for both you and the little girl and her friends, I don't think she'll like sharing her birthday either.\n\nEdit: Also the type of college age parties I've seen or attended aren't the type of thing 7 year old kids should be attending.", "NTA see if you can find a venue that is not your mothers house and tell her she's welcome at.your party.or the coworkers kids party but they will not he the same party", "NTA.

Do you have a relative or friend who can host the party at their house?  What a accomplishment,  I wish you the very best in life.", "NTA, but might I suggest you could work this in your favor.  Plan the kids party for earlier in the afternoon and plan your college friends for later. Ask for an increased budget since you are throwing 2 parties. Rent a bouncy castle for the day (preferably with a slide) and buy a keg. Set up a few tables for beer pong and flip cup. Kids play with water, then college friends use beer once they clear out.
