That is not a valid reason at all. You are not an emotional support animal.", "NTA you're not your sister's keeper, and she's acting her age or more immaturely by insisting you should be. If she needs a better support system while at home, she needs to be the one to find it with help from her therapist and boyfriend.", "NTA. You're not an emotional support animal.\n\nYou're entitled to live your life. Your sister can talk to her therapist and work out her own shit.", "Not only leave but u may need go Nc ur sister a narcissistic and gonna destroy u I have feeling", "NTA.  Both you and your sister have to realize that you are not a therapist and have no business trying to give her therapy.  \n\nShe is being selfish and thinking only of herself and not of your own needs and life goals.  Move out asap.", "Your her sister, not her therapist.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Okay, when I was younger I had a similar situation with my older sibling for different reasons. I begged him to not move out until I did because I didn\u2019t think I could handle our parents abuse without him. But, he had to do what was best for him, so he left. I forgave him.  \n\nIn this situation, you are not TA for moving out and starting your own life. However, to ease this, could you maybe go to a joint therapy session with her to try and aid in her talking to her therapist?", "NTA get out and run", "OP - your sister is doing emotional blackmail with you and the sooner you learn to put your mental health needs first the sooner you'll be able to spot it in other potential relationships as you go out on your own and learn to avoid sooner than later.  People will always do their best to suck you into their drama and leave you spending your energy with them.  According to you, your sister has some challenges emotionally and she has a therapist that she doesn't actually utilize to help herself, but she likes using you as a mental punching bag to put up with her immaturity.  There's no need to be beholden to her because any worthwhile relationship is never one-sided.", "You aren\u2019t her emotional support person she has a therapist for that.. Move ..get a life ..and enjoy it.. \nnta", "NTA - You should try communicate your feelings to her, and say that you\u2019re ready to move on and stop being her emotional punching bag", "NTA\n\nYou are nobody's punching bag or free therapist, leave as soon as you can. If she feels she cannot vent to her therapist then she has the wrong one and needs to change.", "NTA\n\nYou already have your own life to live and figure out, you have no particular responsibility in supporting your sister (emotional) life. At some point, she will need to mature and act her age.", "NTA. Sometimes when you leave a bad situation you realise that you loved the people in your life to keep from hating them.\n\nYour sister will not grow because you are or are not there. It's a choice she needs to make. \n\nLive your life. Don't let others live it for you.", "NTA your sister is abusing you. Good on you getting out of there, but you should start setting boundaries while you're still there.", "Therapists are literally there for the emotional support, that\u2019s what they\u2019re PAID to do. If she can\u2019t put her emotional needs into the hands of her therapist then she needs to rethink if they\u2019re the right one for them. \nI spent years being an emotional punching bag and I can tell you the feeling of being free from all of that is amazing! Look after yourself first and express your boundaries to your sister. She needs to reevaluate her choices if she\u2019s emotionally blackmailing you into staying in a situation that is unhealthy for you.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have an obligation to listen to your sister\u2019s problems, even though that sounds selfish, which it isn\u2019t.", "NTA, you can\u2019t live your life for others. Let your parents be concerned about supporting their daughter. You will always be her sister. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be manipulated by a teenager.", "NTA. So she is trauma dumping on you and is emotionally manipulative. Nope. Leave, OP. You can't live your life putting her first.", "It sounds like she is communicative about feeling and doing so with you. Which is a healthy while it seems like you just want to avoid which is not healthy causing stress. I feel like your calling her mental immature as a projection because you can not/ do not want to talk about feelings. As speaking about your feeling and thoughts show you are actually mature. When you talk about feelings that makes for healthy relationships. While her expressing things it may hurt you but have you expressed you\u2019ve been hurt ? Holding the things you do over/for someone is a form of control and narcissistic tendency.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She will avoid getting more healthy mentally if you are her emotional dumping ground!", "I do not think it is emotional blackmail. As having a sibling who refuses to acknowledged feeling and wrong doings and just wants to leave everything in the past without talking about it is unhealthy. It is called emotional avoidance when one party or both refuse to process issues. Which later let them more or less brew or bottle up leading to further stress and toxic relationships. Later leading to toxic out burst. While therapist help work with you to talk about things when the other parties will not accept or acknowledge what happened. Just remember a problem or wrong doing can not be solved unless it is brought to the other attention. So for instance icing them out or not talking to them is not healthy. Sometimes it the only choice when dealing a narcissist aka the grey rock method. To acknowledge a problem you calmly confront them yet passive aggression is a form of manipulation used my covert narcs. Yet as someone with cptsd I\u2019ve forgotten memories due to stress and trauma. So passive aggression is very unhealthy and very hard when dealing with narcissist who gaslight and lies. Yet it just shows telling a family member to talk to a therapist instead of you is emotional avoidance. If you can not health resolve an issues get a mediator. As I was always trying find way to explain feelings to others to get them to understand more than just their side."]}
