The ice was starting to crack. My 6 yr old has coordination issues  and was starting to have a meltdown so one hand no longer sufficed (she was dropping to the ground and refusing to get up without force) and I needed both my hands to help her get across and had to temporarily leave my 8 yr old in the middle of the pond (she can't ice-skate yet I was teaching her) telling her to hold still. She was screaming and crying but I got back to her quickly enough before the ice cracked. \n\nShe has been visibly shaken and reluctant to interact with me since. My mother (67f) is close with the eldest and thinks I should've been able to get them both across (I couldn't due to 6 yr olds meltdown and needed both hands to pick her up and get across) and that if I really couldn't do both I should've chosen the eldest because \"she's the one who has a chance at s future\" \"the youngest will never get better\" and \"your 8 year old is going to remember this for the rest of her life that she almost died and you still favored her sister\" \n\nThat was not my intention, I got her across first bc I believed the eldest could take the instruction to hold still til I got back (youngest is too developmentally delayed to do so). \n\nWife was not there with us at the time but agreed with my decision. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673727589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10by9kd/aita_for_helping_high_needs_disabled_daughter/", "score": 581, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This would have been stupid with two neurotypical children who both KNEW how to skate.

She very likely feels like she doesn\u2019t matter to you and that you\u2019ll always prioritize the youngest because of her various issues, even if her life is on the line as well. I know that\u2019s not what you intended, but I think it would absolutely make sense for her to feel like that. She\u2019s just a little kid and from her perspective, she just experienced her parent running away with her sibling to safety and leaving her in danger and I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll get over that any time soon, if ever. \n\nThere was a thread somewhere asking about what it was like growing up as the sibling of a chronically ill or disabled child and a lot of those siblings have had similar issues where they feel like their parents care more for the child that needs extra attention/help or that they\u2019ve been roped into being a caretaker for the rest of their life as well instead of being allowed to have a childhood of their own and it causes a lot of issues within the family. Honestly, you might all need therapy to help her process and heal from this.\n\nYour mother, however, is out of line for saying that to you about either of your children. What the actual fuck. If anyone\u2019s the asshole in this situation, it\u2019s her.

You end up in situations like this often and it sucks but it\u2019s part of raising two young kids, one of whom has a disability.\n\nHowever, there are some things you can do to prevent this in the future or minimize this. One of them would be to ensure you\u2019re taking them to an activity where both or one of them can handle the activity mostly on their own. If you\u2019re teaching your neurotypical daughter how to ice skate take her out on her own. The one on one time will be invaluable to her as well since I\u2019m sure she rarely gets it since her sister was born. Once she can ice skate well enough you can start bringing your other daughter (you could even be taking your other daughter on one on one ice skating trips as well). This way if something like this happens again your neurotypical daughter might feel empowered to step in and help or at the very least would be able to remove herself safely along with you and not have to be abandoned. \n\nI think you should also have a conversation with your neurotypical daughter about what happened, why it happened, and why tough things like this sometimes happen when you have a sibling with special needs. Take her to lunch one on one. Ask her how she felt. Really listen to her. Hear her out. Explain your side of things and tell her you\u2019re going to do your best to make sure she feels just as important in the future.\n\nSome people are shaming you in the comments but no one can even come close to imagining how difficult it is to be a parent to a child with a disability. You are doing the best you can. When you can do better you should. But that does not mean you are failing as a parent. \n\nAlso grandmothers comments were disgusting and insanely ableist. Keep an eye out for that and make sure she doesn\u2019t put anything into your neurotypical daughter\u2019s ear that could make her resent her sister. And make sure she doesn\u2019t get chances to put down your other daughter as well as she should only be surrounded by people who will empower her and see her life as one that is worthy and not lesser just because she was born different.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA.

But your child doesn\u2019t have that ability to comprehend. All she knows is that you chose your other child over her. You prioritized her sister. You\u2019ve taught her that she is the lowest on the totem pole, and that you don\u2019t value or love her as much.
