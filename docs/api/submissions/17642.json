How often does she thoroughly soap her leg hairs, are they breeding grounds too? But even so, for straight hair I thought the consensus by experts was don't wash too often.

Daily washing resets sebum levels and when they dry out, they go into overproduction. When I was younger I had extremely oily hair and initially washed daily. Then I read about how stripping oily skin of oils is counterproductive, and so I started shampooing once every two days - initially for a week or so, it became quite oily, but after that it adjusted and my hair didn\u2019t get so oily between washes.

If you would like a nice compromise, try wearing a bonnet while against her furniture. Its not expensive or very inconvenient. It sounds like y'all are close, so going out of the way slightly shouldn't be too hard. Your not gross though for sure, this is completely a mind thing of hers. I wash my hair every other day, sometimes skipping conditioner. As long as you don't sleep with wet hair it's not germy. If you are sleeping with wet hair, she's totally valid.

When your hair is washed daily, your sebaceous glands (oil producers) in your scalp over-produce because they're trying to replace what you're taking out.

It really doesn\u2019t matter how small the surface issue is, the bigger issue is you are a separate person, you are an adult who can live your life as you choose, and unless you ask she should keep her options to her self. I got to partly witness my cousin having the defining moment with her mom, it was glorious and hers was one of the bigger blow up ones because it also involved her mom overstepping with my cousin\u2019s child. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I would call it a defining moment, but one of the things that got my mom to realize I didn\u2019t have to do things the way she did was over my CUTICLES! Talk about small! All while I was a older kid and teen my mom was obsessed with my cuticles being pushed down. Finally at about 16 or so I was fed up, and asked why did it matter?!?

I looked into it and as I was already a wash my hair once a week person, decided to give it a try. There is definitely an adjustment period and really I noticed 3 times my hair/scalp adjusted over about a year and a half. I haven\u2019t used shampoo since. I \u201cwash\u201d with hot water about once every 1-2 months, more in summer because of sweat, but less in winter because dry air and make sure I rub my scalp vigorously to exfoliate.
