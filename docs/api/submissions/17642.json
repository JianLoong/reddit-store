That said, the idea of not washing it at least every other day makes me feel itchy. But I have fine, oil prone hair and scalp psoriasis. I can't imagine being able to go so long without it feeling horrible, even though I know it's not only possible but desirable to do so with curly hair.

Most people probably shouldn't wash their hair every day. I've got straight short hair and wash it every other day", "NTA - I would also suggest that your mom's hair is so oily because she washes it too often. This strips the hair of its natural protection system causing it to create more oil to try and replace it. You don't say how often she washes her hair so this may or may not apply. How often does she thoroughly soap her leg hairs, are they breeding grounds too? But even so, for straight hair I thought the consensus by experts was don't wash too often.

Curly hair is treated differently because it *is* different. \n\nShot in the dark - did your dad ever say anything about his family's hair care or what he did before he buzzed it off to your mom, or has she been playing guess and check with how to take care of you and your hair?

Since doing this my hair is the best it has ever been and everyone comments on it.\n\nWhen I tell none curly/textures peeps my routine they are shocked. A few have responded with a bit of disgust because I think for alot of people daily washing is so ingrained into them anything else is unclean.\n\nI guess you could try and explain the routine to her and why it works.
