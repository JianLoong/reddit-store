She always claims she loves them, buys them way too many presents, but doesn't seem to actually know what to do with them.\n\nShe is not my first choice for a babysitter but I had to work and desperately needed a sitter. MIL agreed. MIL has a newish boyfriend (about 6-7 months) We will call him Nick. Nick is a huge asshole.

I'm not a big fan and i don't even know him that well.\n\nThey day MIL was supposed to babysit Nick was over (which is fine) but I overheard their conversation and she was trying to pawn babysitting off on him. Nick was clearly saying no. He was even like why do you think I'm going to take care of these kids? Ask my ex wife how much I took care of our kid?\n\nMIL started guilting him about how he wants her to go to some holiday party with his work friends and she needs to get her hair and nails done. Nick responded that she didn't because his friend's wife looks like a soccer mom (see why I don't like this man???) MIL tried bribing him with sexual favors and then badly done fake crying. Finally I came out and let her know that I heard all of that. \n\nMIL tried to laugh it off and said they were just joking. I screamed at her that it wasn't funny and those are my kids she was trying to pawn off on some man child asshole. Nick snapped at me that he never did anything to me. I said just because she likes shitty men doesn't mean my kids should be subjected to him, and told her everyone makes fun of her for being with this guy. MIL said she would babysit and told me to calm down, but I refused. I said maybe I'll make it easy and she won't ever have to see her son or grandkids again.\n\nMIL began to get upset and Nick yelled at me for being ungrateful and being mean to her. I called in from work and ended up being fired, so now MIL is claiming that was manipulation and I did it to prove a point.

The boyfriend, while he's a total waste of space based on your description, was not in the wrong to refuse your MIL's request and probably didn't deserve your attack in this case.\n\nBut what gets me is that you really ramped up the drama here, and bad things are happening because of how you reacted. You need to get a handle on your reactivity. This kind of blow-up is not a good thing to have around your kids. \n\nSounds like you had your kid's wellbeing in mind, but in the heat of the moment you forgot to meter your own behavior for the same reason.

If I had to guess it might have something to do with your problem solving skills which apparently involve eavesdropping for way longer than you needed to in order to know what was up, and jumping out of hiding places and *screaming* insults and threats.

Also what  happened at work that you called in sick one day and they fired you ?? Were you on probation did you know that you would be fired if you called in?\n\nNick sucks because soccer mom comment and the ask my ex how much I watched my kids is he bragging about being a bad dad?\n\nMIL sucks a little because if I left my kids with someone I would at least expect a heads up that  someone else was going to watch my kids.", "ESH. I get the distinct feeling that there\u2019s a lot here that we\u2019re not being told", "You called out and got fired? There's more to that than you're telling. Either way, ESH, you all deserve each other from the sound of it.", "ESH, except for Nick.\n\nAnd it was *so* going to be N T A when I started reading. \n\nBecause if MIL agreed to babysit, then she needed to babysit, not pass off her duties to someone else (Nick) without your express, advance permission.\n\nBut you were a total asshole to Nick for no reason at all. You might not like him but he seems completely blameless in this interaction. He merely refused to babysit, and you called him \"some man child asshole\" and a \"shitty man,\" and told your MIL \"everyone makes fun of her for being with this guy.\" \n\nWhat the heck did he do to deserve that? Say that his friend's wife looked like a \"soccer mom\"? He's right, he didn't do anything to you.", "ESH\n\nNick sounds like an asshole for sure.  \n\nYour MIL handled that badly.  She isn\u2019t TA for not wanting to babysit.  Many people love their grandchildren but don\u2019t have the time or energy to babysit.  She\u2019s TA for agreeing to do it and trying to pawn it off on an unwilling asshole.  She would be TA for leaving them with with any third party (including an actual living Saint) without you and your husband fully agreeing.  However, she wouldn\u2019t be TA if she just admitted she isn\u2019t up for taking care of 3 year old twins all day.  \n\nYou are TA for threatening that she may never see her own son again.  That is 100% your husband\u2019s decision.  Whether she sees the children is something you would need to actually discuss with him.  I understand why you were angry but your reaction was ballistic.  It\u2019s every parents job to keep their children safe, mentally and emotionally, but this sounds a lot more like you used access to your children as a weapon.\n\nYou probably do need to evaluate what role Nick will play in your lives and set boundaries with MIL, of course.  When you find a new job, secure regular paid childcare.", "YTA. You WERE abusive to her and Nick. \n\nI would be just as upset if my MIL tried to pawn babysitting my kids off on her new boyfriend, but \u201cno\u201d is a simple answer. You didn\u2019t need to go off the rails because you disapprove of her relationship, which is frankly none of your business. Quite frankly, Nick refused to babysit the kids anyway, so she wasn\u2019t going to be able to pawn them off. But the correct way to go about this was to pull your MIL aside and inform her when you ask her to babysit her grandchildren, you are asking HER. And if it is such a problem, you won\u2019t ask her anymore. The threats were no necessary. Please act like an adult. And honestly, adding in that you got fired for calling out\u2026I mean one doesn\u2019t normally get fired for a one time call out, so this sounds like maybe it was a long time coming, and perhaps this is why you reacted so badly.", "YTA. Your question was AITA for threatening to never let my MIL see her grandchildren again. Yes, you are. What she did didn\u2019t warrant that kind of response. Agreeing to babysit should not be a condition of being allowed to have a relationship with your grandchildren. \n\nYour MIL should not have asked her boyfriend to take care of the kids without clearing it with you first, but you were cruel to poor Nick who did nothing wrong. As far as losing your job, well, that\u2019s your fault. Your anger got the better of you. MIL said she\u2019d babysit. You wrote you were already on thin ice which makes me wonder if you have a hot temper at work, too.", "ESH You're clearly leaving bits out of the story. I would bet anything you weren't fired because you called off one time, even last minute.", "ESH.", "Yta.... talk about shooting yourself in the foot. Can your family afford for you to be fired bc your ego got in the way?  \n\nNick might be an AH, but you're not dating him, and he doesn't owe you anything. Nor your kids. \n\nYour MIL is your MIL, you know what's she like. Choose to be around it or not.", "Honestly you were in asshole. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with anything nick said in that situation. He said no and rightly so. Props for him to for speaking up for his girlfriend. \n\nHe was right he did nothing to you", "You called off work once and got fired? Sounds like things weren\u2019t going to well at work. As for not letting your kids be watched by them, that\u2019s perfectly fine to decline especially since you actually heard the convo. As for telling Nick exactly what you thought of him, I wouldn\u2019t have taken that route. Simply stating that you won\u2019t be leaving your children with someone you\u2019ve only met a few months ago is enough. As far as her being the \u201csocial media\u201d type grandma in your opinion. Understand that some mothers are not the motherly type. Sone women get pregnant and take responsibility for the child by doing the things a mother does. But it never comes naturally. Once this type of mothers children are grown, she\u2019s in no hurry to repeat the child caretaker role (not even for a few hours). The issue comes up when said mom never admits this to herself so that she can counter others expectations. Loving grandkids doesn\u2019t always mean waning to care for or watch them. Her love language (Google it) may be \u201cgifts\u201d instead of \u201cquality time\u201d or \u201cacts of service\u201d. Now you are right to expect her yes to be yes and her no to be no", "YTA - You sound so childish in this! You got angry at your MIL over something so minor simply because you don't like Nick. As far as you've told us he hasn't actually done anything to you but you go off at him anyway. You made nasty comments to your MIL about what other people say about her and even after that she still said she would take care of the children... You verbally abused both of them then you got yourself fired when you didn't need to.\n\nSorry but you sound like the abusive one here. Nick may be arrogant but he's with your MIL and you have to accept it. She's a grown woman and can make her own choices of men. They did nothing to you but you blew up at them.... She was doing you a favour, she didn't have to agree to help you but she did.\n\nYou got yourself fired.", "Yta\n\n\nFirst as most have said your reaction was over the top. Nick isn't a nice person but he turned her down.\n\n\nIf your mother in law is so awful why didn't you come up with multiple alternatives. \n\n\nIn addition what does your husband have to say in all of this?\n\n\nYou being fired isn't because of this event. It's a long string of events with this being the final straw.\n\nAs a parent it's your responsibility to find proper child care. All you did was ridicule your mil of why she isn't proper child care material. Guess what don't use her.", "YTA Nobody owes you their time. Clearly MIL has a social life going on and she's not much into playing grandma. Some people are happy to hang around their grandchildren as much as they can and some are happy to see them once in a while but are done with child rearing. MIL is living her life and she shouldn't be required to put it on hold because of her grandchildren, she is done raising kids. She and Nick might not be nice people, we do not know, since we got only a very one sided account but they definitely didn't deserve to be insulted like that. You should have arranged for a paid babysitter.", "ESH, except maybe Nick. Your mom was being awful, Nick rightly said no. You were then being awful to both of them, while Nick didn't do anything wrong, you went off completely and were very mean to him.", "You called in from work and got fired and somehow that's her fault? You ear droped on your MIL and got into a fit because she had slightly other plans than sitting your kids and tried to find a solution that wouldn't let you hanging? Once? And you totally lost it? \n\nYTA. And you have problems. And MIL is probably not the reason you got fired.", "ESH but you\u2019re wild as hell. People tend to describe their own tone of voice much more calmly than how it comes across but you describe yourself as screaming.

Your MIL sounds bad and you somehow come off as worse in a story you\u2019re telling about her pawning off her grandchildren on a strange (not sure your kids\u2019 level of previous interaction with Nick) man. He sounds like a jackass but also the only one in the story with even an iota of self awareness", "ESH, except for Nick.\n\nNobody owes you their babysitting services, but pawning off a child you've promised to babysit onto someone else without the parent's consent is really bad, maybe even criminally so.\n\nHowever, blowing up about it the way you did was pretty mean.  That's not admonishing anymore, but just plain throwing insults to hurt someone.", "ESH, except Nick. \n\nYou don't like him.  We get it.  But the fact is, he is nothing to these kids and doesn't need to watch them, and the fact that you attacked him for not wanting to watch your kids makes you even worse.  \n\nMIL sucks for trying to get out of something you agreed to, but you are no angel either.", "YTA\n\nYou were eavesdropping on your MIL's conversation with her boyfriend, started to shout at her and then refused her offer of babysitting. \n\nAre you by any chance living at your MIL's house?

You were worse than both of them .", "MIL sucks for trying to pawn her responsibilities off to Nick and, trying to manipulate him in the process. \n\nYou overreacted. Like, majorly so.

You have all the reasons to be angry and want to cut her off.", "NTA. While you may have overreacted, it was understandable given the situation. Your MIL was trying to pawn off the responsibility of babysitting your children on her boyfriend, and even tried to bribe him with sexual favors.

He seems very self aware that he doesn\u2019t want to play doting step grandfather.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to like kids.", "No assumptions.... just what you wrote and why you don't answer questions \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you got fired on a maybe? \ud83d\ude36  you put your kids stability in jeopardy bc of maybe \ud83d\ude33", "The kids were never in \"danger\", Nick made it clear he wasn't going to watch the kids before you threw your little tantrum and got yourself fired from your job. And for the record just because he said someone looked like a soccer mom doesnt mean he's some baby killing maniac. Calm TF down and get over yourself.", "Not only is he self aware about not liking  kids but also self aware he wouldn\u2019t be a good child minder so I don\u2019t see how your kids were in danger by him", "YTA if she's unreliable and you don't respect her, why where you even leaving your toddlers with her?\n\nThey may be assholes outside of this situation, but in this instance you were the only asshole", "ESH", "INFO: If this woman is your MIL, where is your partner and why couldn\u2019t they take off to watch the children?", "Poor Nick, guy didn\u2019t do anything yet he still got cussed out", "YTA. Stop using her as free babysitting service. I hate people who feel entitled to have their in laws to take care of their children.", "YTA. MIL wrong for trying to get Nick to watch the kids so she could get her nails done, but you had no right to eavesdrop and then insult Nick nonstop. He didn\u2019t do anything to you. Then you went nuclear and threatened to take away the kids and her son. Why? What were you so angry about, and why were taking all your anger out on other people? Sorry you lost your job but it certainly sounds like that is no one\u2019s fault but your own. You have some issues you need to work on, and you owe Nick an apology for your rudeness.", "NTA  You were protecting your kids from jackasses.", "A great assessment of the situation.  Threatening that she\u2019ll never see either the kids *or her own son* again makes OP the asshole automatically IMO.  That\u2019s some ego trip she\u2019s on herself.", "3 year old twins", "> Read again what you told a free babysitting option\n\nShe was no longer an option because I couldn't trust her judgment. She tends to tantrum until she gets things, so he could have given in later, or she could just just snuck out of the house", "You exhausted all your other options???  If you knew you were on thin ice why aren't you paying a daycare to watch your kids?  And don't tell me it is so expensive.  I know, I am a single mom and pay a hefty amount every week so I can work to pay all the other bills.\n\nMost companies don't fire out of nowhere.  You get a verbal, a write up, a PIP.  Then you get fired.  You knew it was coming and did nothing to ensure you had consistent dependable daycare set up for your kids.  Don't try to blame others for you getting fired.  That is on you.", "And MIL doesn't let people say no to her, especially not men. If she kept going and wore him down? Or if she just slipped out of the house?"]}
