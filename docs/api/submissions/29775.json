The thing is she denies even doing it which has kind of left me at a loss.\n\nRecently I have decided to take a new approach. If I have to clean up an area, I have been tracking when, where and before/after photo of the area then sending it to my wife. This has obviously caused a bit of tension between us and her calling me petty and an asshole. However, since I started doing this I have also noticed a steep decline in messes made.

It was driving me absolutely insane, especially when I was the one who was expected to do the housework (because I had the pets). He'd go on random cleaning streaks (like once every several months), and get \"upset\" at the dog hair in a corner, but would be completely blind to the fact that he literally just picked up an entire mess of his own and proceeded to move it to another location and now thinks he's \"cleaned.\"\n\nThankfully we are just dating, and I got in a position to afford my own place again, and wow - I'm realizing just what a pig he is.

The reason you resorted to taking photos is because she denied it was her making a mess. Have a talk with her now and tell her you won't send any more photos, but you aren't going to be cleaning up after her anymore either. \n\nIt isn't fair for one person to make a mess and then expect someone else to pick it up for them. If someone sets an empty soda can down on a windowsill and walks away, who is it they think is supposed to pick it up and throw it away if not them?

What's her solution, if she denies doing it and you believe she's wrong?", "This one is tough - I would say NTA so long as you have a history of attempting to discuss it with her, you've allowed for some compromise, and she's refused to give any ground. I had to do similar documentation with my ex wife surrounding who did the cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. because she was beating it into me that \"I never helped\" and it made me go crazy - second guessing myself and my contributions. After I did that for a couple months it was clear I did by far the majority of the household work - but I didn't really bring my tracking forward like you did. Mostly it was helpful for my own sanity.", "NTA", "Sounds like this relationship is already over. NTA. If she is really this resistant to the bare minimum expectation in a nesting partnership that shared spaces be kept tidy, you should be seriously reconsidering things.", "NTA. Most of the time, when people outright deny there is even an issue, it is so that there is no way possible to be held accountable for it. Could be conscious or subconscious, but definitely keeping you from even starting to come to a resolution. By the time one partner is exhausted and gives up even trying to convince the other partner of the problem, the offending partner has won by sidestepping accountability. Infuriating.\n\nSetting these kinds of boundaries is really difficult and going to be uncomfortable, and likely going to start more fights, but it's necessary unless you want to leave the relationship. Stay calm and firm. And maybe, instead of spending your energy on proving that the issue exists, somehow find a way to put the responsibility and effect back on her. Like instead of cleaning up for her, move the trash to an area that would force her to have to deal with it before she could carry on. She'll get the message then, and if she huffs about it, you can say, well this is what I have to do every time I need to sit down at the desk to work, so I figured, if you didn't care to inconvenience me, you can be responsible for taking care of it before you can complete your task. Some people are incapable of seeing the effect their actions or inactions have on others until they are forced to.", "Love this lol might be as arsehole in your wife\u2019s eyes but crack on", "NTA. She doesn't like being called out, but it is working. Give her some positive, non self-congratulatory reinforcement that you see she is doing a better job at keeping things nice at home and you appreciate it. Don't go into how you're managing her or talk about 'messes' or 'progress.' Just say the house looks good, you see her efforts and appreciate her for it.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think this leads to bigger issues in other areas of the marriage, but just be aware. \n\nOut of curiosity I\u2019m wondering how the mess looks. Lol.", "NTA. Her denying she makes a mess is ridiculous and I've dealt with it before. Your approach is sadly one of the only ways she'll learn", "I once responded to an AITA by saying that both of my kids would have been oblivious to a car having been stolen from the garage.  Got a lot of ripping.  Regardless, I KNOW neither of my kids would have noticed (for reference, these kids are 20 and 21).  \n\nIts so much harder to address a behavior when they are literally oblivious to it.

These messes are in areas that I want to sit or need to use. If she is home and not busy then I ask her to clean it, but I am not sitting in a mess rather than cleaning it so i can be comfortable.\n\nMaids aren't free and this not a realistic option for most people.

My partner is not great at cleaning up after himself or doing chores either, and I know it can be intensely frustrating. It\u2019s taken about 10 years to get to a point where I\u2019m chill with it - I\u2019ve let some things go, and he\u2019s gotten better with some things. I\u2019ve learned which chores he will reliably do (empty the dishwasher, vacuum, bedding) and those are his. For the rest, if I ask him to do anything, he generally does it happily. He will never deep clean on his own but if I start doing it, he\u2019ll join me. Sometimes I remind myself of the other things he brings - this man will never cheat on me, he will do anything I ask with a smile on his face, he can fix anything, he puts up with my flaws with good humour. So I can change the empty TP roll and put his plate in the dishwasher, it\u2019s fine.\n\nSo it\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s pretty okay. \n\nBut that\u2019s how our situation worked out, a lot depends on personality style. If she\u2019s not willing to make any admissions of her failings, that\u2019s going to be a big challenge. If you\u2019re not willing to pick up the slack when she doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s going to be a problem too because I can all but guarantee you that she\u2019s never going to fully change, and you don\u2019t want to live in a state of perpetual pissiness. \n\nMaybe you need to sit down together and make a plan. Make it clear you\u2019re reaching the end of your rope and see if you can, together, sleuth out some solutions. Maybe counselling. Or maybe you need to decide what you\u2019re really willing to live with, and what you aren\u2019t. \n\nI do know that you can\u2019t go around making lists of how much your partner sucks. Because you might be cleaner than she is but I bet you suck in other ways and you wouldn\u2019t enjoy seeing them listed out on a regular basis."]}
