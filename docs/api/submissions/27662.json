I had him pull up his grades and he is failing everything again. I told him I am done. I will pay to finish this semester but I won\u2019t pay for college anymore.\n\nThis resulted in an argument where I told him I don\u2019t think he smart enough for college because he can\u2019t learn from his mistakes.

He's clearly wasting time and money being there, he has no interest in actually being a student.\n\nThe way you phrased it - that he's not \"smart enough\" probably did come across as asshole-ish. He was obviously intelligent enough to get accepted into the school, so it's not that. He might be awful at time management, unwilling to put in any effort, might have some kind of previously undiagnosed learning issue, or, most likely, doesn't know how to handle the freedom of being at college and is running wild. \n\nIt's a good opportunity for him to get a job and figure out where he actually wants to go with his life. Maybe in a year or two he'll be ready for college. Or maybe he'll discover he'd be better off learning a trade. Or maybe he'll go a completely different direction. All are acceptable, but none mean you have to just keep dumping money into an education that he's not receiving right now.", "NTA. I'd be so mad. My college was paid for by my parents, back when that was even possible, but nowadays, most families cannot pay for their children's post education. You gave him a gift and a chance, and he pissed it all away.", "So I\u2019ll go with NTA. It wasn\u2019t cool to tell him he isn\u2019t smart enough, but I get the frustration. It sounds like he isn\u2019t really ready for the independence part of the college experience. It sounds like he Might be better suited to get into a community college where he can still be at home to have some adult oversight, and perhaps a less pressure situation which he can explore different majors to find something he is actually interested in.    \n\n\nI was a terrible high school student and community college really gave me a great less expensive option to take some entry level classes of different majors and I found one that interested me and right away all my grades skyrocketed because I started to care.   \n\n\ngood luck to you both!", "That\u2019s an insane amount to pay for someone who literally doesn\u2019t give a fuck. I\u2019d have lost patience after the first semester", "People always spend thier own money more wisely than they do someone elses. If hes paying tor it himself, maybe he\u2019ll put a little more effort. NTA. Its great if you can pay for college and are willing. But he should show some gratitude and apply himself. Youre just subsidizing him going to parties right now", "No, I\u2019m sorry, while your wording may ave been harsh, the sentiment has merit. \n\nLook, there is book smart-and life smart. Flunking out and getting arrested?, (OP had to \u201cpick him up at the station\u201d), for partying points to a distinct lack in both kinds of smart. \n\nYou didn\u2019t sacrifice andy save money to put your kid through college so he can party his ass off and  flunk out. In the first year. WTF\n\nThe kid needed a wakeup call. And your ex can pay if *she* cares that much. Or your kid can put on his big boy pants and take out sone loans. Maybe maybe maybe, if one or both of them are footing the bill, your kid will take college more seriously. NTA", "NTA  \n\n\nYou're not the asshole for refusing to pay anymore; it's clear he won't put the effort it and there's no point paying towards it anymore. Maybe a little harsh calling him not smart enough though.", "NTA for refusing to pay for more college.  Your son is obviously not taking it seriously and there's no point in him attending classes if he's just going to fail them all.\n\nYTA for telling him he's not smart enough for college.  That's not what the issue is.  I guarantee you he's just not attending classes or doing the coursework; most people could at least manage passing grades if they did the bare minimum.  He's treating college like a big party and he's pissed that you're not going to bankroll his screw-around time anymore.\n\nI'm not generally a tough love kind of person, but that's probably what your son needs.  He needs to learn that you can't just waste all your time fucking around.  You gotta do at least the bare minimum first.\n\nEDIT: To all the people saying, \"No, he's just stupid,\" stop and ask yourself what the OP was accomplishing by saying that to their son.  Do you *want* this lazy kid to decide that he's incapable of striving for more than a dead-end job and living in his parent's basement?  His actions were clearly foolish and immature, but what's your goal by telling him that those actions define his maximum potential?  Too many people don't think their words through.", "**NTA**.\n\nPeople work multiple jobs to pay for University. Him having his University paid for was a privilege, not a right, and he blew it with his nonchalant behaviour.\n\nIf your ex has a problem, she can pay for it herself and see if she'll be as patient as you were when he was blowing his studies and you were paying for nothing.", "NTA. Do you have a community college near your house? Maybe he can go there. If it's a state school it shouldn't be nearly as expensive as a private one.

He is being stupid and needs to change that.", "Hard NTA and you could have said far worse. Everyone here arguing about semantics need to get over themselves. Idiot, dumb, not naturally intelligent son, whatever you want to call it fucked up not once, but twice ON THE MOM'S DIME!

Hell no.", "NTA\n\nYour son is the asshole, not you. You gave him a warning and he's not changing or taking the opportunity seriously. To continue to pay for him to go to college is (a) throwing money away and (b) enabling him to live a bad and unhealthy lifestyle. The average Redditor has skin about as thick as a Kleenex, so I can see that they're giving you a hard time for saying your kid isn't smart enough for college, but older generations heard far worse from their parents (I know I did). I may have hated my father for saying rude things to me when I messed up, but it was far better for him to be upfront, honest and not mince words rather than tap dance around to avoid hurting my feelings (sometimes people need their feelings hurt to see the truth of their shittiness). I guess the price you pay is that your son may hate you and may avoid talking to you as he figures out his life. This is for the best. Your son needs to grow up and learn that his actions have consequences. Regardless, you're being a good father by setting healthy boundaries.", "NTA.  Why would you continue to pay when he is failing?  He's not taking it seriously.  It sounds to me like he is not mature enough to be in college bc all he's thinking about it partying.   If he buckles down & gets serious that would be one thing, but paying or someone to go to college who is failing everything is futile.", "Have you actually really sat down and talked to him about why he's failing, without trying to you know, make it a fight? Just talk to him like another person?\n\nIs he struggling with depression or ADHD?\n\nWas there a life event - a break up, a lost job, a family member's death, a pet death, etc?\n\nWas he a \"gifted\" kid who never learned proper study skills because he never needed to, and is now struggling in college (I TOTALLY don't have experience with that one... that was sarcasm)\n\nIs he just overwhelmed with the workload? College is a big and honestly pretty scary life change, and it's very different from highschool. He might be having trouble adjusting to suddenly being expected to be far more independent (another one I'm pretty familiar with)\n\nIs he having trouble with teachers? Because let's be real, sometimes professors are assholes, and a professor can really be the difference between a student that does well, and a student that struggles.\n\nThis really feels like something that's worth trying to fix by talking with him, maybe going down to part time school, or moving to online classes, or helping him get more support from counselors or tutors, before we just assume that he's an idiot who doesn't care about his future.", "You shouldn't pay for his college. If he wants it he should work for it", "Tough love only works if they take your threats seriously. I'm a tough love kind of dad. I was always intentional with my words. If I said I was going to do something, I did it. My kids know not to test me when I'm serious.  At the end of the day, everything I say and do is out of love for my kids. Also, life is tough and unforgiving. It is important for kids to develop resilience.\n\nMy son failed a lot of classes in HS.  He was very smart but did not want to apply himself. It was pure laziness.  I told him he had options for college:\n\n1.  Join a sport and try to get a sports scholarship.  He didn't even try. \n2. Join the band. He is a gifted musician. Taught himself to play the piano and guitar.  He never joined the band or made any attempt to utilize his musical talents.  \n3.  Study and get good grades so maybe he could get an academic scholarship.  Instead, he failed numerous classes and started using drugs \n4.  Last option was to get a job and pay for college himself.\n\nI also told him if he got a partial scholarship or got decent grades, I would help him pay for college.  I just wanted to see him trying.  It was not fair for me to foot the entire bill and he did nothing to ease the burden of college tuition. If he was failing classes in HS, why would college be any different?\n\nAt one point I had enough. I told him if he didn't make an effort to do something with his life, I would drop him off at the homeless shelter. I wasn't joking. No bums allowed in my house.\n\nSoon after, he signed up for the Navy. Best thing he ever did. He's in shape, off drugs, and half way through an electrician journeyman's apprenticeship. \n\nHe's a different person now and I couldn't be happier. \n\nDownvote me all you want.

He will probably do the same with any job he gets sadly.", "NTA I would not invest my money in a failing proposition either.\n\nTell him to get a job.\n\nOf course, he'll probably get fired in record time but at least you won't be pouring your money down a rabbit hole.", "NTA.  Ok, maybe for saying he isn\u2019t smart enough for college, you didn\u2019t have to go there.  But 2 semesters, failing out, partying?  Nope, you should not be throwing good money after bad.

At this point just passing isn\u2019t even good enough for you to start paying again. He wasted your hard earned money. You have to literally do nothing and not show up to fail ALL classes.", "NTA.  My son did the exact same thing.  We financially supported him.  He did not have to get a job.  His only job was to go to class and pass.  He did neither.  After the first semester, we told him. Pass or we are done.  You will pay us back for every semester.  \n\nHe did not do any better.  He wanted to stay there and get a job.  We told him that\u2019s fine, but you get no money from us to support you.  Needless to say he did not last long there afterwards.  He came back home, got into trade school, and is doing excellent now.  But he did have to pay us back every penny we spent on his college.  We refused to give him any money after he basically flunked college.  He learned the hard way.

Harsh truth for many to hear and I'll likely be down voted but I too was told as a young person I could pay for my own college if I wanted to go because I wasn't smart enough to do it-from my own parents.

In other words, making it crystal clear he\u2019s got one semester to turn things around or you\u2019re done paying.  I had the same issue in college in the late 90\u2019s.  Got into a good college, but immediately my focus and only focus was partying.  Part of this was my own lack of self esteem and insecurity issues where I was desperately trying to reinvent myself as a \u201ccool guy\u201d after feeling very less than in high school.  I think much of it was also undiagnosed ADHD, where juggling being on my own, \u201cadulting\u201d, having poor willpower, and compulsive tendencies made carving out the time I needed for studying much more difficult.  I joined a fraternity, which made it much more difficult for obvious reasons.  After my first year, I was failing some classes and was put on academic probation.  My parents sat me down, expressed their disappointment and frustration, but then listened to me about what was going on that was making me slip up like that.  I switched majors (which I thought would upset them but they were very supportive) and the disappointment I knew they had fueled me to right my ship and I had a cumulative 3.85 GPA for my last 3 years.  Got into a top 20 law school after that (had to explain why my first year was truly an anomaly) and the rest is history.  If they\u2019d withdrawn financial support after my second semester (and trust me, they\u2019d expressed their discontent after my first semester but didn\u2019t threaten to stop paying) and I had to just drop out I have no idea where my life would be today.  Sometimes a black and white ultimatum that still gives the person time to fix things can work, so I\u2019d suggest considering that approach.  And while you\u2019re at it, apologize for telling him he\u2019s not smart enough.  That\u2019s how I felt after my first year, and if my parents said I wasn\u2019t smart enough it would\u2019ve crushed me.

I feel like maybe you meant to say that he is not making smart decisions for his future. But putting your kid down like that can lead to built up resentment. You appear to be supportive as a parent in encouraging his success, but I would say remaining patient and allowing him to experience the consequences of his actions is the best route. Tough love is one thing where you allow the opportunities for them to make their own choices and own up to their own mistakes, but putting them down or saying hurtful language typically results in creating rifts in the relationship. In my opinion, it sets a precedent that your love is conditional upon his success, or what you deem as success.\n\nThat being said, I only speak from a place of how I was raised, being childless myself.
