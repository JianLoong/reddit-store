I was initially planning on a surprise party but since I don\u2019t know all her work friends, I figured it was best to plan it with her. I wanted to make sure she had her input and have it just the way she would want it. I planned on a few surprises, such as, having her favorite band play there.\n\nWithin days after her 39th party, I told her of what I would like to do. She was thrilled. I asked her to provide me a ballpark guest list idea, so I could scope out venues to accommodate her friends and family, as well as, start working a budget on food, drinks, etc. This was step one in process as the venue determined date availability, band booking, etc. Once I had a list of venues, I could let her choose which one she liked.\n\nOver the first two months after her 39th bday, I consistently reminded her I needed a list, or at least a number of guests. She always said she was working on it. I stopped reminding her, and now fast forward 9 months my wife asked me how the planning was going. I told her it stopped because I never got the list/number. All the venues are now booked for the most part, and the band is not available. \n\nI offered a smaller party or trip for just us, but now she is upset she can\u2019t have the large party she planned on. She thinks I should have reminded her more or just booked something and she would\u2019ve adjusted her guest list. AITA?\n\nEdit for info: When I was thinking of this party and the amount of people, I was thinking of a hall rental. Something along the lines wedding venue (ish), but rather large.  From a budget perspective, I had $15k saved. $3-$5k for the band guesstimate. Then the rest for dinner and an open bar. If she would\u2019ve said 100 people then I would know to look for a venue with $100 a head, or if she wanted 150, then I would have to save more or adjust the per head cost. Venues this size are limited in my area, thus the need for advance notice to book.", "created_utc": 1673455404, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10998hu/aita_for_not_throwing_my_wife_a_40th_birthday/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You reminded her several times.  She isn't a child.  You have a back up plan (smaller party or trip).  If she still wants a big party, maybe you could have it but late.  It didn't sound like she was that into it, if she couldn't give you a number/ guest list.", "NTA. You reminded her several times, and she's the one that dropped the ball.  She doesn't get to blame you for screwing up, especially since you even proposed a plan B and it still wasn't good enough. If it was that much of a priority, then she should've given you an answer when you asked or she could have set herself a reminder.", "NTA - she is going to be 40 but acts like a 4yo", "NTA:  if I'm reading right her birthday is in one month.  Not sure how she believes the party is still happening if she never made a list of people to attend", "NTA; She\u2019s turning 40, not 4. You gave her a year\u2019s notice and reminders - even if she\u2019s overwhelmed and/or neurodivergent, she could\u2019ve gotten that info to you. A final warning would not have been the worst thing in the world, but if stuff is booked then what can you do?", "NTA she's an adult you should not have to keep reminding her.\n\nHad you booked a venue for only a certain number and then she wanted more people that probably would have been wrong too.", "INFO: did you tell her you stopped planning due to a lack of info on her part? I could see her being peeved because she assumed you'd been planning for the last nine months and didn't realize her lack of info was holding you up - preemptively I'm going to say ESH due to a lack of communication on both sides", "NTA, reminded her more? WTF is that?", "NTA. She's a grown up. You asked her several times for the necessary information. She failed to give it. You need not chase her around, begging for a head count. If it was that important she would have taken care of her end.", "NTA - I hate it when we ask people a very simple basic question and they can't be bothered to answer. You asked her more than once so this is all 100% on her. We all know that had you gone and booked a venue without the numbers it wouldn't have been good enough. 40th birthday..... I'd rather a nice romantic trip for two instead of a party. She clearly wasn't that invested in her party or she would have answered you the first time.", "NTA You asked for the info you needed multiple times and she didn't provide it. Because of that your original plan was no longer practical so you offered alternatives", "NTA", "NTA. I hate when people get angry at bad results when THEY'RE the one grinding the process to a halt. You shouldn't have to hound a 40-year-old woman just to get a guest list. Who knows if she would've followed through on any other important details?", "Tbh, I feel like some comments are infantilizing your wife. She\u2019s not a baby. You shouldn\u2019t need to remind her this many times for that long to do something so basic. That said, considering the big occasion and importance, I don\u2019t think you should have given up after 2 months, annoying as it would be to have to keep hounding her, so ESH.", "esh - she didn\u2019t give you a list of her work friends but i mean surely you could have planned soemthing including family, friends you do know?", "ESH.\n\nShe should have given you a list but you could have booked a place without a list. So what if it\u2019s not big enough? That\u2019s her problem and she\u2019d have to cut her list down.", "I'm going with YTA for a few reasons\n\n1. You wanted a guest list 10-12 months in advance (right after her 39th birthday) and gave up after *2 months*? I get that you need to plan ahead, but come on. You couldn't have reminded her at, gasp, 8 months away? 6 months away? \n\n2. If you couldn't get the list from her in advance, you still certainly could've guestimated and booked a venue. As she said, if her list were larger than the venue then she could have trimmed accordingly. It's your wife - surely you could anticipate a baseline of guaranteed guests (family members, closest friends, etc).", "YTA. When I planned my wedding the venue didn\u2019t need an exact number and detailed list until two months before. \n\nThat was a formal wedding. You surely had a rough idea in mind of how many people would attend? \n\nIf you were that desperate for an exact number, why didn\u2019t you tell her that planning would be put on hold until she gave you a complete list? Why haven\u2019t you bought it up in the last ten months?\n\nIt sounds like you did this on purpose to teach her a lesson.", "ESH but I feel your more of the TA. Yeah she is an adult and she should have given you a list. But it wasn't coming and there was no need to just sit and wait 9 month. You could have told her way early you stopped planning and it won't happen anymore or you could have made a rough estimate for people you DO know about or like she said book a venue and then told her the limit is now 100. I don't know I think it's still her birthday and announcing a gift and then doing nothing for a whole nine month seems overly comfortable to me.", "YTA\n\nYou gotta learn to set a boundary. \"If you don't give me a guest lost by X date, I will no longer be planning the party as there won't be time.\" is different than \"hey do you have that list yet?\" and then crickets. \n\nNow she's upset because she was looking forward to something that... oh yeah... you ended up making HER responsibility! You said you were gonna plan something for her and when it didn't go super easily you just abandoned it with no thought or conversation with her!\n\nIs this some sort of malicious weaponized incompetence thing, where you get to say \"well I tried to do something nice for you but you made it impossible! I just can't do it!\"??? Grow up man.", "Yta. \n\nWho has a guest list 1 year out.\n\nYou could have easily ballparked 40 people and been safe.", "ESH. She should have taken your request more seriously but the fact you didn\u2019t book *something* is odd. You could have just said ok I\u2019m booking a venue for 50, so that\u2019s the limit on the guest list now. \n\nI get asked to book events all the time at work. If people are vague or slow on the details I take it upon myself to book the space as they fill up and then we work around that. I don\u2019t sit around waiting for finer details otherwise nothing would get done. \n\nNeither of your are AH, though.", "YTA, you did not need a guest list of your wife's work friends to plan a party for her birthday. That was just the excuse you gave yourself to not do it. You have royally messed up here, not only have you disappointed your wife you have hurt her feelings deeply. By not following through you have basically shown her that she wasn't worth the effort. Good luck getting back into her good graces.", "INFO if she tells you now can the party still happen? She should have provided a list. When you officially stopped planning you should have said so.", "Soft, ESH. She definitely should have gotten back to you, but I wonder if she wanted you to take the initiative.  I planned a 40th birthday party for my husband and I did all the work, including the guest list. You couldn't figure out who her friends and family are? Maybe I am projecting, but women get stuck with a lot of invisible labor, even for things that are supposed to be for them.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think it would have been that difficult for you to roughly estimate how many people, you could have also asked her friends.", "YTA for attempting to plan it an entire year ahead of time and getting frustrated when she didn\u2019t have the information. The guest list very likely would need updating if you\u2019re trying to do it this early, this is entirely on you.", "ESH she didn't care enough apparently, but it was your (self appointed) job to take care of it. A simple \"let me know till day so and so or I won't ve able to book\" plus a reminder 2 weeks before that should have been the least.", "[deleted]", "You\u2019re the one planning the party, it\u2019s on you to make sure the party happens.

Instead, you put it on her plate to take the next step in planning her birthday party that you offered to throw for her, and when she didn\u2019t do it, you let the planning die.

Why is all of that mental load on him?", "She's an adult, why couldn't she have answered?

We have to compete with Weddings, other bdays, etc. I was thinking a hall or something so we had plenty of room for the band, tables, dance floor.  Also the year gave me time to put deposits down, get my money in order depending on what she wanted, and all that jazz. More importantly the headcount and it being accurate, would determine my cost per plate. Not to mention the cost for an open bar.

Probably would have to move from a Hall (100-150) people. To a restaurant (30ish), no band.  I offered to take her on a trip to see her favorite singer in a location we\u2019ve never been before with VIP tickets", "He was asking to start planning a year in advance, not finalize everything by then. He reminded her many times. It\u2019s easy to see how her procrastination could be taken as a sign of disinterest.

I don't know if your wife needs to ask for help or what but ultimately I'd say this comes down to communication.", "I don\u2019t think OP is at fault. With hindsight perhaps it\u2019s easy to see a better way but he asked her repeatedly. I\u2019d take that as a sign of disinterest myself.", "It's called 'being an adult.'\n\nTwo months of asking was too much.  Hell, the third time reminding would have been too much.\n\nHe shouldn't have to lay down hard deadlines for her to facilitate the things she wants.", "I think if it were me I would take the hint and assume she just doesn't care that much about the party. I guess she says she wants it now, but actions speak louder than words. When she was in a position to demonstrate that she wanted it to happen she showed no interest. The investment in time and expense is surely great enough that it would be wasted on indifference. \n\nI don't make it a habit to force others to explicitly reject my ideas. If they act like they don't care, I think it's best to just hear what they're telling me.", "That's exactly what I was going to say - OP should have told her that if the list isn't given by a certain date then the party planning can't continue. I'm still sticking with ESH because of the lack of communication and disjointed understanding of what was happening on both sides in terms of the continuing of party planning", "No, he wanted to plan a surprise party, but correctly concluded that this would be a terrible idea.\n\nSo he, per his submission, planned it with her.  He asked for a guest count.  She literally couldn't be bothered to say 'idk, 25?' and move on with her life.", "Never fails to amaze me the mental hoops people will jump through here to make it the man's fault.", "I had budget but the headcount was shooting from the hip.

It\u2019s a very popular cover band in my area, so their calendar fills up fast.", "He didn't ask for an exact headcount a year out from booking the party. But for many venues, you do need to reserve a date 9 month to a year in advance depending on if it's a busy season, headcount or not, and canceling can involve fees. I don't book huge birthday parties, but I know for my wedding venue we needed to book about nine months in advance, and that was during their less busy months. (I'm not giving you exact info. You can research wedding venues yourself if you're that curious.)\n\n>What if people from work got fired? Or new people start?\n\nThere's this nifty invention called a notebook.", "No I just know a venue of 40 would\u2019ve gotten me in trouble", "Yeah...I think the best thing to do now is to try to make up and move forward in a collaborative way to find something special to do for her 40th, whether it's a party with friends in a less-formal venue or a special vacation just for the two of you.", "It's still best communication to explicitly state a deadline.", "So\u2026 why didn\u2019t you just book them, then? The band doesn\u2019t care if they play to 10 people or 100. \n\nIf you have a specific budget, just set the headcount yourself and tell your wife she can invite x number of people.\n\nReading your responses, I feel like you were making excuses to avoid planning this party.", "I'm just saying he looked for an out.", "Ok whatever your number is. \n\nThen the convo would have been...\nH you can invite 50 people\nW why only 50?\nH Because you never gave me a guest lost so I had to guess to ensure we had a venue\nW Ok cool I'll make sure to keep it at 5p", "That\u2019s the plan. We are going to do the works. We are going to see her favorite musician in a state we\u2019ve never been to before. VIP tickets, first class flight.  I know the guest list for that..2 :)", "Of course it\u2019s best. Hindsight always tells us we could have done better.", "Because I didn\u2019t have a venue to book them into? Dates are a thing, the venue may be available but the band may not be, or vice versa. It\u2019s her bday, it\u2019s not up to me to dictate who or how many she can invite. The number of people lead to the venue, the venue to cost, the band to venue and the date. All starting with the number of people which is most important.", "You don\u2019t need a venue to book your favorite band, you need a date and a deposit. When you plan an event you start with the most important piece and work from there.\n\nI can guarantee, without a shadow of a doubt, that your wife would have had a nice milestone party planned out for her well in advance with ANY number of people, as opposed to a bunch of hype and no party at all.", "So if I booked the band for 5/7/23(made up date), she wants 200 people, the only places that can accommodate that many are booked for that date, then I\u2019m out the band deposit? What if there aren\u2019t any venues for that date? The most important thing here is the venue. Think better.", "No you book a venue for 100, then book a band for that venue, then tell her she can invite 100 people. The number of people you actually invite is the most flexible thing about this process."]}
