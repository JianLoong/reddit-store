I was initially planning on a surprise party but since I don\u2019t know all her work friends, I figured it was best to plan it with her. I wanted to make sure she had her input and have it just the way she would want it. I planned on a few surprises, such as, having her favorite band play there.\n\nWithin days after her 39th party, I told her of what I would like to do. She was thrilled. I asked her to provide me a ballpark guest list idea, so I could scope out venues to accommodate her friends and family, as well as, start working a budget on food, drinks, etc. This was step one in process as the venue determined date availability, band booking, etc. Once I had a list of venues, I could let her choose which one she liked.\n\nOver the first two months after her 39th bday, I consistently reminded her I needed a list, or at least a number of guests. She always said she was working on it. I stopped reminding her, and now fast forward 9 months my wife asked me how the planning was going. I told her it stopped because I never got the list/number. All the venues are now booked for the most part, and the band is not available. \n\nI offered a smaller party or trip for just us, but now she is upset she can\u2019t have the large party she planned on. She thinks I should have reminded her more or just booked something and she would\u2019ve adjusted her guest list. AITA?\n\nEdit for info: When I was thinking of this party and the amount of people, I was thinking of a hall rental. Something along the lines wedding venue (ish), but rather large.  From a budget perspective, I had $15k saved. $3-$5k for the band guesstimate. Then the rest for dinner and an open bar. If she would\u2019ve said 100 people then I would know to look for a venue with $100 a head, or if she wanted 150, then I would have to save more or adjust the per head cost. Venues this size are limited in my area, thus the need for advance notice to book.", "created_utc": 1673455404, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10998hu/aita_for_not_throwing_my_wife_a_40th_birthday/", "score": 435, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You couldn't have reminded her at, gasp, 8 months away? 6 months away? \n\n2. If you couldn't get the list from her in advance, you still certainly could've guestimated and booked a venue.

Yeah she is an adult and she should have given you a list. But it wasn't coming and there was no need to just sit and wait 9 month. You could have told her way early you stopped planning and it won't happen anymore or you could have made a rough estimate for people you DO know about or like she said book a venue and then told her the limit is now 100.

You said you were gonna plan something for her and when it didn't go super easily you just abandoned it with no thought or conversation with her!\n\nIs this some sort of malicious weaponized incompetence thing, where you get to say \"well I tried to do something nice for you but you made it impossible! I just can't do it!\"??? Grow up man.", "Yta. \n\nWho has a guest list 1 year out.\n\nYou could have easily ballparked 40 people and been safe.", "ESH.

That was just the excuse you gave yourself to not do it. You have royally messed up here, not only have you disappointed your wife you have hurt her feelings deeply. By not following through you have basically shown her that she wasn't worth the effort. Good luck getting back into her good graces.", "INFO if she tells you now can the party still happen? She should have provided a list. When you officially stopped planning you should have said so.", "Soft, ESH. She definitely should have gotten back to you, but I wonder if she wanted you to take the initiative.  I planned a 40th birthday party for my husband and I did all the work, including the guest list.

Also the year gave me time to put deposits down, get my money in order depending on what she wanted, and all that jazz.

When you plan an event you can start with the most important piece and work from there.\n\nEdit for people downvoting this: I was an event planner for two years, it\u2019s very rare to have a precise guest count when you\u2019re working a year out. In this case OP had a budget and a band, that\u2019s enough to get started. \n\nI can guarantee that your wife would have had a nice milestone party planned out for her well in advance with ANY number of people, as opposed to a bunch of hype and no party at all.", "So if I booked the band for 5/7/23(made up date), she wants 200 people, the only places that can accommodate that many are booked for that date, then I\u2019m out the band deposit?

She took no action for the following 9. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nI've worked in an area of event planning for several years. OP was correct that venues book 1 year out, and bands (especially a good one) books a year out as well. \n\nBudgeting is also a huge factor- I have had clients with major sticker shock and because they waited until the last minute to plan, their options were extremely limited and what was supposed to be a fun event to plan, has now become extremely stressful to them. \n\nIMO, most people should easily be able to pick a ballpark number of guests off the top of their head depending on their expectations for the event. However, I can see not wanting to over or underestimate. \n\nI would have however given her a measurable goal and said \"I need to know the estimated number of guests by xx date so I can plan accordingly.\" If she failed to provide that number by the agreed upon date then you wouldn't be asking if you're tah.", "Lol to 15k for a 40th birthday party.

The fact that she left you to your own accords shows she trusted you to make the decisions. \n\nI'm assuming you've been married to her for awhile and this isn't the first time where you've struggled to communicate on planning things.

A trip for just the 2 of you would've been amazing.", "ESH, assuming you didn\u2019t tell her that you were going to put plans on hold until you got the list.

I think you could have reminded her rather than thinking to yourself, \u201cmeh, oh well.\u201d\n\nI think you feel like you tried, but you could have done a bit more, especially knowing how excited she was with your original plan. \n\nBut\u2026not all is lost!\n\nWhy don\u2019t you plan something outdoors if it\u2019s warm enough?
