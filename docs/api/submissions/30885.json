I actually started saving for a house since I was 18. I bought a 3/2 house 3 years ago and while it's not the best house I am beyond blessed to own my own house and homeownership is everything I always hoped it would be. To be able to come home and have everything exactly where I left it, to be able to play video games all day and have no one tell me otherwise, it feels like I am free and in control of my own life which is all I've always ever wanted. \n\n\nAbout a year ago my older brother (36M) and his wife (30f) asked to move in with me because while they can afford rent they do not want to pay $2000 a month for an apartment. While I did not want them here I reluctantly agreed because I can't tell my own brother that he can't live with me when I have 2 empty rooms in my house knowing he would let me live with him if I had ever asked and I was also fortunate enough to have family to live with while I was saving to buy my hosue. I do not charge them any rent or ask for anything, but they give me around $400 a month to help out. \n\n\nMy brother and his wife had been trying to conceive a child for a long time and are finally successful in doing so. They are expecting in a few months. While I am extremely happy for them I also do not want them living with me. I did not buy my house for them, I bought it for me. I did not sign up for having my living room filled with baby toys and having my gaming room turned into a kid's bedroom. I did not sign up for my fridge being full of milk for a kid that isn't mine. \n\n\nThis leads to today where I have asked them to move out before the birth of their child. They were both extremely offended and hurt that I told them this. My family also seems to think it is wrong of me to ask them to find their own place when they are expecting a child. \n\n\nAITA for asking my brother to move out?", "created_utc": 1699873093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17u86yq/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_cant_raise_his/", "score": 653, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Living with a screaming baby is a NO DEAL.", "NTA.\n\nYou were gracious enough to allow not only your brother, but his wife to live with you for what I assume was a limited time. For them to try and force a child into YOUR living space is beyond entitled.\n\nPart of me feels like this was planned way in advance. They knew they would be able to save quite a bit of money by only paying you $400 in rent each month for the soon to be three of them, thus allowing them to save up enough money to care for a child the way they've been fantasizing about. Also, I'm sure if you don't put your foot down now about them moving out, they're going to take advantage of you in other ways once the baby is born. Suddenly you'll find yourself being the built-in babysitter, the errands \"gopher\", etc.\n\nNot to mention what some other commenters are saying about babies changing the dynamic of the household. Do you think when that baby is crying all hours of the day and night only your brother and his wife will be able to hear it?

You are NTA, but not very smart.", "NTA.    Sensible people arrange somewhere to live before activity trying to have a baby.    It\u2019s not reasonable of them to expect you to allow them to completely take over your home and turn it into their family home, and make no mistake a baby will take over your home.", "NTA\u2026..

You already gave the family a wonderful gift for letting them live with you for minimal expenses.  They need to get their heads out of their asses and accept that not everybody wants to live with an infant/child.", "Nta! They can afford to move", "NTA.  I bet they will struggle to both pay $2000 in rent and to pay for daycare.

For such tiny little things, the amount of room they take up is insane. Your bro and sister in law can afford rent, they just don't want to pay it. It's weird they even admitted that when asking to move in and pay excessively low rent, but to expect that sweet deal while you go to work tired because you've had 6 weeks of a newborn that isn't yours crying throughout the night?

Maybe help them move since she's pregnant but definitely b4 baby arrives.  They wanna \"have\" a baby they can't keep acting like babies.  Plenty of places cheaper than that even if they have to move further away.  If the other relatives are that bothered by your actions suggest they take them in. You've had them long enough.

Stay strong on this, OP.", "NTA\n\nworth sharing your concerns as they have the option to leave all the toys in the one bedroom, the gaming room should still be a gaming room, not your problem that they are having kids\n\nnot being able to afford an apartment, but being able to afford a kid ?", "Omg! They never should have been actively trying to conceive before they moved out! They never planned to leave, you will be forced out or made to be a live in babysitter if they stay!", "NTA", "NTA.  They're taking advantage of you, they've had a free ride for long enough. They also need their own personal space with the new baby, even if they have to pay for it.", "hard NTA", "NTA, why are they trying to bring a baby in the world when they don't even have their own place to live??? They can't afford rent, babies are expensive as hell. They should've planned better.\nPlus, it's your house. It's super inconsiderate to have a new born and live in a house that belongs to someone else. They cry a lot and, as you said, their toys and crap would be everywhere.\nSounds like they need to get their shit together.", "NTA. This is why people should learn to Always put a time limit of someone moves in with them. Never let someone move in indefinitely as they might not want to leave. Ever. Your brother and SIL seriously expected to bring a kid(s) into your home??? Didn't think you might want to have a familyof your own? Jesus.", "The timing of your request to them is insensitive and AHesque. You know they cannot afford to support two people and you wait till a third is on the way to make your pronouncement? Yikes. Speaks to extreme lack of empathy and understanding, and significant selfishness. Look, from the story you recite it seems that you have been extremely generous and selfless up until now. You have set aside much of your comfort zone for the sake of doing for your brother and his wife the same they would do for you. I agree with you that a convo and a plan are needed to get them to become independent and self supporting, especially at their age. But springing your demand on them at this moment is the ultimate in bad timing. Apologize to them for your insensitivity and then have the needed discussion about the future. Create a timeline together that allows them to get through the birth and new baby time without the stress of imminent deadlines. Kindness is called for here DESPITE WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE FOR THEM. Kindness. He will always be your brother, she will always be your sister, and you will always be Uncle J1995916. Be kind, gentle as you are communicating and cooperating towards the future plan. Good luck my friend and congratulations to all.", "Is there any chance that your brother s name is Alan? If so, I think you are in deep sheet", "NTA\u2026.. you\u2019re a fool, why are you not charging them rent? I bet there is no lease in place, they can stay there for as long as they want and you have no power to move them out.", "NTA.", "Agree with everything you said except for OP giving his bro warning *not* to have to baby -- *who* in their right goddamn  mind gets pregnant when they are bunking in with someone bc rents are too high? OPs bro and SIL sound pretty entitled, and I sure hope they don't make him go to the trouble of legally evicting them. I wouldn't put it past the type of people that would purposely get pregnant while someone else is doing them this type of *huge* favour. Beyond disrespectful, I think they are taking advantage of OPs good nature \ud83d\udcaf.  OP is NTA as long as he kicks them to the curb asap.", ">Plus if people are upset with you asking them to leave, then those people should house the soon to be family of 3.\n\nI would straight up tell those people that criticize OP, 'Thank you for caring so much about my brother and SILs living conditions. I will let them know you are open to housing them and their upcoming child, for free'. Then I would give the brother a list of all the supportive people who he could go live with.", "I agree but OP, INFO. Did you know they were trying oe did they recently just tell you?", "Exactly. If I were OP I would have set more parameters around the arrangement. Ex: you are welcome to stay for up to 12 months, this should give you an opportunity to build your savings and form a long term plan. Or, you two are welcome here, but no guests and if you want to have a baby you need to be out of here before it arrives. \n\nBut they are pretty entitled to think they could stay indefinitely and add a third person to the mix while apparently not forming any long term plan. NTA OP, but next time you open your home you need to set expectations to avoid this in the future.", "\u201cHey brother, life is changing for both of us and we need to come up with a plan. A baby changes the household dynamics and I\u2019m sure you will want to create your own environment. I plan on doing construction in five months, so I need to know you will be in your own place by then\u2026.\u201d", "Doesn't seem like poor planning but excellent planning. If it happens like some stories of Reddit, they might even push op out of his own house", "It\u2019s not 9 months it\u2019s a few months.", "They moved in a year ago.  Like someone else said, they used to pay $2k/month in rent, but are only paying OP $400/month.  That's over a year of $1600/month they should have been saving up.\n\nI got the feeling reading this that they just planned to stay with OP forever.", "Couldn't agree more with your comment. People should be properly set up if they want a child. If your dependent on someone else, like OP's brother, than your not properly set up.", "NTA. You\u2019ve kindly allowed them to stay with you til now, allowing them to save money.", "We all know they\u2019re gonna see OP as a free, in house baby sitter", "Well this comment took a dramatic turn.", "They can, they just don't want to. I bet their plan was to stay there indefinitely, and eventually kick OP out because \"they need it more than he does\". It's a very common story with childfree people, their lives are suddenly worth less.", "Yeah but he also agreed to let the two of them live with him, letting them save money while doing so. A baby is loud and makes sleeping quite difficult. It's not for everyone and he has to right to not have a baby there.", "The brother and SIL should have asked OP if it was okay to bring a baby into the house.  They shouldn\u2019t have assumed that it was okay to bring a baby in the house.  When did they tell him they were trying for a baby?  \n\nA baby changes everything.  It was rude and disrespectful to assume that they can raise a baby, that they can\u2019t afford under his roof.  I mean it\u2019s going to be you need to be quiet the baby is sleeping, 2:00a.m. baby wakes OP up crying because it is hungry, the baby is colicky and won\u2019t stop crying, asking could OP babysit the baby for a bit, etc\u2026.   They should have been able to save thousands living with OP and been able to afford their own place.", ">I'm leaning towards YTA if you didn't bring this up before they started trying\n\nWhat? It should have occurred to them that they're going to need their own family home before starting a family in someone else's. You're just trying to be different.", "Well they didn't forewarn him that they might be considering starting a family either when they moved in. Why OP would have to be the one to think of this I can't imagine. It's on brother and wife.\nThey've had a year of being able to save on rent, only paying 400 a month which would barely cover utilities and food. They should have been house hunting once they discovered she was pregnant if not before if this pregnancy was what they were planning. And had a conversation with OP about this as soon as they found out.", "Right. He's the asshole. Not for what he did. But for the timing of when he did it.", "Yeah I feel like if you can\u2019t afford rent and have to stay with a family member then you definitely can\u2019t afford to start a family, it\u2019s bizarre that they would even consider trying for a kid when they don\u2019t have enough money to cover the main and most important living expense. Were they just expecting to live there long term and raise a kid while OP subsidises them?", "As for the warning, I think it would've been better for everyone if OP told them ahead of time. You're absolutely right that it shouldn't be required, but it's better to say it than assume it's understood, because in this case it clearly wasn't.", "Nothing disrespectful about having a baby! That\u2019s a weird take. That said. OP has been very generous to have them love with him so far, and it\u2019s fine to tell them it\u2019s time for them\nTo get their own place, giving them plenty of notice, as he has. I suspect OP is from a culture where is it expected to have have family members live with you. But even so OP, there is nothing wrong with you choosing who lives with you in your house.", "I didn\u2019t even think of that. Clearly I have too much faith in people.", "You should read that post then. The OP was homeless, and none of the family helped him. He managed to get a camper and a great boss who let him park it on premises and use the facilities. He saved and bought himself a house but kept the camper. His brother and SIL ended up losing their house and were living with the parents. SIL gets pregnant and all four of them decide that OP is to give up his house, go back to living in the camper (that his parents refused to even let him park in their yard) and let his brother family have the house for free while OP still paid the mortgage and utilities on the house.\n\nI wish I had the link cause the entitlement and favouritism was infuriatingly strong in that one.", "Well damn. I never thought of that. \n\n\nKICK EM OOOOUUUTTTTT!", "OP notes that her sibling WAS paying 2k/ month at their apt but didn\u2019t want to because it was an apt.\n\nThey only pay her $400.00/month. They should have been putting away $1600.00/mo towards their own house. Her brother and his wife should have plenty of $ to either get their own place or buy a small house.\n\nIMO her brother and his wife have kind of taken advantage of her. To make it worse? They brought other family into it, trying to shame her.\n\nNTA, but I do think her family is.", "Yes, if they couldn't afford 2k a month rent for the two of them, where are they getting 2k+ a month to rent elsewhere with an extra room and pay for childcare? They assumed op would support them and likely assume she will babysit too.", "Right\nThey expect OP to move out once baby comes...because... Family", "Right?  The absolute entitlement and assholery of some people *never* ceases to amaze me.", "So should OP also inform them that having a baby is also a *big* responsibility?? one that they should prepare for and have their OWN place to raise baby? Why tf should OP have to educate his older brother on the basics?  C'mon....this is outrageous.", "I mean, I think it\u2019s polite to ask the person providing you with housing how the feel about living with a baby, but maybe that just me. \nIt would be a dealbreaker for me too. They shouldn\u2019t have assumed they can just bring a baby into an existing housing situation and the homeowner will be fine with it.", "Of course there's *nothing* inherently disrespectful about having a baby -- just *not* when you are staying with someone else (relative or not) and hardly paying any rent ffs ($400.00/mo barely covers anything these days!). It's a most ridiculous *and,*  Yes!\ud83d\ude44 very disrespectful!!  as well as entitled and immature. I'd go on but you likely get my drift.", "Nothing disrespectful about having a baby if you have your own place.
