I actually started saving for a house since I was 18. I bought a 3/2 house 3 years ago and while it's not the best house I am beyond blessed to own my own house and homeownership is everything I always hoped it would be. To be able to come home and have everything exactly where I left it, to be able to play video games all day and have no one tell me otherwise, it feels like I am free and in control of my own life which is all I've always ever wanted. \n\n\nAbout a year ago my older brother (36M) and his wife (30f) asked to move in with me because while they can afford rent they do not want to pay $2000 a month for an apartment. While I did not want them here I reluctantly agreed because I can't tell my own brother that he can't live with me when I have 2 empty rooms in my house knowing he would let me live with him if I had ever asked and I was also fortunate enough to have family to live with while I was saving to buy my hosue. I do not charge them any rent or ask for anything, but they give me around $400 a month to help out. \n\n\nMy brother and his wife had been trying to conceive a child for a long time and are finally successful in doing so. They are expecting in a few months. While I am extremely happy for them I also do not want them living with me. I did not buy my house for them, I bought it for me. I did not sign up for having my living room filled with baby toys and having my gaming room turned into a kid's bedroom. I did not sign up for my fridge being full of milk for a kid that isn't mine. \n\n\nThis leads to today where I have asked them to move out before the birth of their child. They were both extremely offended and hurt that I told them this. My family also seems to think it is wrong of me to ask them to find their own place when they are expecting a child. \n\n\nAITA for asking my brother to move out?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for all the replies. I am not one much for responding to messages, but I just wanted to let you all know I have read your responses and appreciate your feedback.

They knew they would be able to save quite a bit of money by only paying you $400 in rent each month for the soon to be three of them, thus allowing them to save up enough money to care for a child the way they've been fantasizing about. Also, I'm sure if you don't put your foot down now about them moving out, they're going to take advantage of you in other ways once the baby is born. Suddenly you'll find yourself being the built-in babysitter, the errands \"gopher\", etc.\n\nNot to mention what some other commenters are saying about babies changing the dynamic of the household. Do you think when that baby is crying all hours of the day and night only your brother and his wife will be able to hear it?

You are NTA, but not very smart.", "NTA.    Sensible people arrange somewhere to live before activity trying to have a baby.    It\u2019s not reasonable of them to expect you to allow them to completely take over your home and turn it into their family home, and make no mistake a baby will take over your home.", "NTA\u2026..

It's weird they even admitted that when asking to move in and pay excessively low rent, but to expect that sweet deal while you go to work tired because you've had 6 weeks of a newborn that isn't yours crying throughout the night?

Maybe help them move since she's pregnant but definitely b4 baby arrives.  They wanna \"have\" a baby they can't keep acting like babies.  Plenty of places cheaper than that even if they have to move further away.  If the other relatives are that bothered by your actions suggest they take them in. You've had them long enough.

This is making me think if bro and SIL would actually help OP out like how he stated bc their reactions give off \"We assumed you would let us and our unborn child and potentially other children to live in this house sense we can't afford it ourselves and you know this so out of the kindness of your heart you should ve letting us stay however long we want\". This also makes me wonder if OP parents housed him to help him bc they knew eventually they could use it as a weapon to make him help when they don't want to", "It's very possible that they did their budget with that $1600/month difference in rent overall versus staying with brother being how they can afford the kid. So to the \"parents\" it feels like rug pulling, but OP would've just been hounded earlier on to let them stay with a baby before they even concieved if they gave that warning.", "Agree with everything, but, if they can't afford to live on their own, they shouldn't be trying for a baby. That's incredibly irresponsible.", "Or at the very least be prepared to move once it does happen and have it as planned out as it can be.", ">who in their right goddamn  mind gets pregnant when they are bunking in with someone bc rents are too high?\n\nAbsolutely correct, but it also doesn't seem like OP was in the dark about this, either:\n\n\"My brother and his wife had been trying to conceive a child for a long time and are finally successful in doing so. They are expecting in a few months.\"\n\nLet's just assume that 'a few months' = 3 months, and so he's known for \\[about\\] 6 months...\n\n\"Y'all need to GTFO\" just seems like a hell of a thing to spring on someone so late in a pregnancy.\n\nIt just seems like something that would (should) have come up in conversation sooner.\n\nUltimately OP is NTA, but I also don't like to be all-or-nothing in my thinking, and have told other people in this sub stuff like \"NTA, but here's the one thing you could have done different, better, and/or been cooler about.\"\n\nNot that he is required to, by any means.\n\nMore along the lines of helping people answer this question:\n\n\"I'm NTA, but why is everyone else in this situation treating me like I am?\"", "100% this.\n\nOP, for everyone who gives you a hard time, simply respond with the above.\n\nOr:\n\n\"I will let Brother and SIL know that you plan to house them and their child at this juncture.

Maybe even raising more then one child down the road and just expected to never need to deal with housing costs again while raising a family at the expense of the younger brother losing his freedom in his home and losing some rooms to his older sibling and wife. \n\nLike a couple in their 30s shouldnt be just accepting wanting to live with a sibling as much as they shouldnt be wanting to live at home without at least working towards independence unless I suspect they were using the extra savings as a way to splurge on themselves and not even considering the future expenses.", "They were intending to conquer the house using tHe BaBy as both weapon and shield.", "Oh, no, they considered it. They considered that if they had a baby OP would never kick them out, and they house would be virtually theirs - a room for themselves, another for the baby, the living room and kitchen full of baby stuff...

He'd wake us up at 11 PM and complain they're out of diapers and formula and either my parents or I would have to drive to Walmart and buy them formula and diapers since neither of them had jobs. We didn't mind because we love the baby - she was the sweetest baby, lively and talkative, and easy to take care of.  \n\nIf you were just idling at home, they would throw the baby on you because 'you're not doing anything. watch the baby' and then go to sleep. They did this even to my 9-year-old brother who had a hard time saying no. My parents and I would get home from work and often find my little brother trying to do homework while soothing the baby on his other arm. It was wild having to argue with grown adults that they should wait until WE get home and then we'll watch the baby from there so they can get some rest.  \n\nIt got pretty bad when my dad made dinner and the both of them ate ALL OF IT without saving anything for the family, and that same day, they woke up my dad at 11 PM to get formula and diapers again.

That way, they could have decided for themselves to hold off or started planning to move out. They probably have their savings all earmarked for baby related stuff and now will have to hold off on buying the deluxe $1,000 jogging stroller because they will have to come up with a down payment on a house and/or an increase in a rent or mortgage payment (boo hoo for them)\n\nAlthough in the OP's defense, it probably didn't occur to him that his brother would have the audacity to raise a family while mooching off someone else and didn't realize it until he realized the baby's arrival was coming closer and closer and yet there didn't seem to be any plans for moving out.\n\nNTA OP. Honestly, I think you were incredibly generous letting them stay with you practically rent-free in the first place when they weren't destitute and homeless, and just simply didn't *want* to pay rent.
