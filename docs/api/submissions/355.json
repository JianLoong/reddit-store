Had lost of ups and downs that are pretty normal with planning weddings. For context my brother and I have a pretty good relationship. We are really close and I get along with his girlfriend.

Whenever he has a crisis they are always ready to jump at the opportunity to help him. A year ago he broke up with a girl a month before they would get married and things ended pretty bad, but not even a month later he found someone new. My fiance and I always held back with our news like engagement and wedding planning because of my brother that was supposed to get married and now 5 days before my wedding my brother asked his his girlfriend to marry him. He told us that they were going to keep it a secret until after our wedding (which is unfair towards his fianc\u00e9) but I still feel extremely disappointed that he couldn't even wait 1 more week. (for their 1 year anniversary. He chose the day they met). My mom and fiance is also upset about this, because we have spent so much time on my special day just for my brother to ruin it a week before the day. My dad says we are selfish, because it wouldn't matter, but if she wears her ring on the day of my wedding family and friends are going to ask questions and all the attention would be (yet again) on my brother.

It\u2019s not like he chose a random day to propose. He chose the anniversary of the day he met his fianc\u00e9, and is really sweet.

And SURPRISE, what the frick do you think guests at a wedding do all night? Sit and talk about you ONLY? Nope. They catch up with each other, talk about their lives, etc. NONE of those things take away from your wedding. It's not like him and girl are following you and hubs down the aisle the same damn day.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think he is either! \nAs long as he isn\u2019t upstaging your wedding and choosing not to announce until after the wedding which I believe is very fair. \nI get not wanting him to \u201cspoil\u201d your day but he proposed on his first year anniversary which was special to him too. \nNo one\u2019s the asshole here! \n\nCongratulations to both of you though.", "NTA. It sounds like your brother has a history of wanting to be the center of attention. It would be one thing if he actually proposed on their one year anniversary but it wasn't even that date. Also why does he need to propose within a year? He's already had one failed engagement, I'm surprised he didn't want to wait a bit longer to make sure this one doesn't end too.

You sound honestly so petty and immature. I'm \u2728\ufe0factually\u2728\ufe0f really close with my brother and I'd be SO excited for him if we were in a similar position. This post (& the comments) reek of jealousy and bitterness. Idk if its a \"thing\" in your family to make everything a pissing match in your family...whether it's a normal occurrence or not, the only thing that's at risk of \"ruining your wedding\" is your 'all about me' attitude. Your wedding is days away and instead of being excited and happy, you're wallowing in self-pity bc you feel like you won't be the star of the day.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People can be happy for more than one person at a time.", "Just to clarify. He was engaged before. Last year and was planning a wedding. He had his chance and it did not work out. We gave him the time to do his thing and he chose to end it. We only started planning our wedding this year. He decided he is in a rush to get married and started planning it and told family about it. Which we said it was okay.  His fiance is one of my bridesmaids and we get a long well. But because he couldn't wait a bit, we have to make sure the news does not get out on my day.", "We had a conversation with my brother where they already started telling family about their wedding and even booked a venue that they have been sharing information on. People were already over our wedding before it even started because of his previous relationship. We have postponed a lot of our stuff to accommodate him. We said that we could focus on him again and to just let the family be happy for me once. But he is a very impulsive person and just expects everyone to forgive him.", "They are in a rush to get married and have already given out a date to family members without the official engagement. We asked them to just wait until after the wedding to get engaged so that his fiance could have all the lime light. I also think it is very unfair towards her that he asked her at a time when she can't be happy and share the news with everyone. Like she deserves. This is the day they first met and a week after is they day he asked her to officially be his girlfriend.", "They are in a rush because they are older. My fiance and I are 25 and my brother is 28 and fianc\u00e9 29. So they are in a rush because of age. They have been talking about marriage a month after they started dating.", "They are in a rush to get married because my brother and his fianc\u00e9 are nearing 30 and time for kids are running out. His previous relationship was rocky since they were engaged for 3 years and couldn't make upt their mind when to get married and he asked us to give them their time to plan and stuff. So when the wedding did not happen we went ahead with our plans. He found someone else through blind date a month later (after his break-up) and decided to get engaged. They have been planning their wedding since they met and we had a conversation with them about it. They agreed to wait. My personal feelings is more towards the fact that since his girlfriend has waited so long for such an opportunity that I feel it was unfair to do it to her if he could have just waited until at least the day after. We told him he could even ask her right after we left the wedding on our honeymoon.", "You\u2019re being ridiculous. \u201cHe had his chance\u201d????WTF.", "People can be happy for more than one person at \u00e0 time.", "Oh no! I get why\u2019d you\u2019d be a annoyed, so I wouldn\u2019t really categorise you being TA in the full sense but I feel like he too has the right to propose as long as it\u2019s not on your wedding day. The limelight will not be really pulled away too much from your and your bride as much as you think so don\u2019t worry, and enjoy your wedding. \nSo I go with my initial statement.", "Maybe there's some cultural context I'm missing but that isn't exactly old. Unless they plan to have 12 kids and need all the fertile years they can get...\n\nRegardless, I think your brother's actions are at best thoughtless and at worst intentionally attention seeking. I suspect he's going to be verbally inviting people to his wedding at your wedding.", "Yes he was engaged for 4 years. They postponed their wedding date 4 time and not because of covid...because his ex fiance had commitment issues. So yes he had his chance and he found someone a month after he broke it off with the other one. They were already talking about getting married when they started dating. They have a venue and date booked already and started telling family about it...", "And? What's your point with any of that? \n\nI announced my pregnancy (something I never thought I'd be able to do) and then two weeks later my sister announced hers. I didn't act like a selfish b-hole when she did. Cool. We get to do this at the same time. \n\nSo what he'd been engaged before? So what if he met this girl 34 seconds after they called off the last one. What does any of that have to do with YOUR WEDDING? It doesn't. It's such a weird misconception brides get thinking that everyone everywhere is supposed to put their celebrations and lives on hold because you decided to get married. Your day is a celebration. It's truthfully ONLY SUPER IMPORTANT to YOU and YOUR FUTURE HUSBAND.\n\n Everyone else just wants to celebrate with you."]}
