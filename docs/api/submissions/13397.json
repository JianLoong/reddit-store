She might be sick right now, and treating every day like her last, and enjoying herself as much as possible are more of a priority to her than you. However, that's a lot of money. \n\nI'd say you should get her a reloadable card so you can give her more freedoms (because sure, maybe the first couple purchases were ok. Definitely not $500 though.) That way she'll still feel like she has freedoms... but can learn to budget a little better, and that she's not going to get more money just because she spent it all at once.", "NTA\n\nI'm very sorry for your daughter, but she's 16 and she knows how to add up.\n\nNo way she didn't realize she spent a lot of money. \n\nBetter to stop it now before it becomes a recurring event.\n\nI hope she's going to be ok.", "NTA.  Your daughter is going through a lot.  See if you can get her into activities she can do during her treatment.  Some therapy may be helpful too.  Look at this as a cry for help, not a teenager spending money she shouldn't have.", "NTA for not letting her make large purchases without your knowledge. It sounds like you handled it pretty reasonably. But it sounds like your daughter is going through a lot and needs something to relieve stress and feel better. Maybe work out with her if there's something specific she doesn't have now that would make her feel better, or if she needs help finding some other outlet for her thoughts/energy.", "NTA. I think, regardless of what she's going through, financial responsibility is an important lesson. It's awful what she's going through, granted, but I don't think you're the AH for saying not to BUY so much at one time. You didn't tell her she couldn't SHOP. Maybe she could start an online wish list instead and get things here and there while still having the fun of shopping and browsing things she wants.", "NTA. Boredom doesn't justify stealing, she could have asked before she used your card. Or just window shopped.\n\nIs she seeing a therapist?", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your daughter. I think you need to have a chat about the value of money with her, maybe give her tangible tokens she can trade you for credit card use.", "Nta. She knew what she was spending. \n\nIf she's getting bored then maybe it's worth finding some stuff she wants to do that you can organise with her, both with family and friends? Just approach the topic with you said you were bored and this happened, so how can we stop you being bored? Is there anything you'd like us to sort for you activity wise?", "NTA \nI'm so sorry OP... I couldn't in a million years say you're the asshole. This must be some of the hardest days of your lives that your daughter and your family are experiencing. \n\nIf money isn't an object, maybe look into getting her a bank card of her own? \n\nFigure out (somehow) what a good spending limit is? Definitely get her and yourself some counselling too, and go shopping together after? \n\nFUCK CANCER! <3 Sending hugs!", "NTA\n\nI have a child with a disability.  It's insanely hard and she has taught me the true meaning of patience.\n\nWhen my daughter was young she bought a bunch of stuff on the old days of the Kindle.  Honestly, I couldn't be mad at her because she was super sneaky and clever about it.  I was able to call and get a refund on those things when I called customer service.  \n\nSo we just put passwords on things and asked her to ask first.\n\nAfter that, she would ask and it all worked out, we were happy to get things she wanted we just wanted her to let us know and if we could financially or not.\n\nI think she feels really bad and is upset with herself.  Say you forgive her and ask that she check in with you next time.\n\nAnother option is to possibly return some things when they arrive etc.  She doesn't necessarily have to keep all of it unless that is OK with you.  If not, I don't see any harm in sending things back.", "NAH- she is going through something huge in her life and shopping is about the most normal teen thing she can do.   I'd get her a prepaid visa or gift card so she can buy things and you've set the limit. \n\nMight be a good idea to get her in some group therapy to deal with this situation and encourage her to be social.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to understand how to respect someone else's money. It's not hers. The fact that you allow her to online shop with your credit card at all is extremely generous. She sounds ungrateful.\n\nI sympathize with her illness but that doesn't excuse literal stealing.", "NTA, I know she is going through a horrendous time, but she is 16 and would know how much she spent and using the card without asking is wrong. even if money is no problem, she did steal. However she probably could do with therapy as cancer and her world changing at such a young age must be horrendous. And she is young and probably misses feeling \"normal\" Can you also maybe take her out using a wheelchair if mobility is an issue, and take her to do something maybe shopping, cinema. I think its not about shopping or money its probably about her mental health needing to do something.", "NTA, but would you be willing to give her some sort of compromise in order to give her something to do? It might be fun for her to have a little clearance shopping budget even for other people, like being in charge of some family birthday or Christmas gifts? There\u2019s a lot of groups on telegram that post really great deals (citycouponmoms, freebieguy, mamadeals). I set aside ten dollars for each person\u2019s birthday, but I tend to get nicer gifts (heated blanket for 6, shoes for 5, things like that). It\u2019s something that helped me through a time when I didn\u2019t have much left of my old self. I just liked feeling like I was a part of something and contributing in my own way. I hope your daughter gets better soon!", "NTA. This is a survivable form of cancer, and while your daughter is going through something traumatic, it's still important that she learns critical skills that will aid her in adulthood. Stealing someone's credit card and going on a shopping binge is a behavior that any parent should discourage and set consequences for.\n\nIt might be worth brainstorming more at-home activities she can engage in to take the edge off of the boredom. Perhaps you two can invest in some purchases that, unlike clothing, will help time pass for her while she's going through this.", "NAH. She went way overboard, but \"new cancer diagnosis\" gets her some slack, she's not an asshole she's probably just freaking out and self-medicating her stress with online shopping. You should probably take away her access to your credit cards for a while, or impose strict limits so she can't overspend. Instead, you could periodically give her gift cards in reasonable amounts to her favorite stores, so she can enjoy shopping in an appropriate way.\n\nShe's also going to need some better ways to handle boredom while she's going through treatment. Reading, playing games on a tablet, puzzles, a new TV series to watch, a journal to write in, something to help her occupy her mind other than online shopping.", "NTA - she shouldn't be taking anyone's credit card and using it without permission. You're not an AH for setting that boundary.", "NTA. How will she learn financial responsibility or financial independence if you don\u2019t teach her? The age of 16 is definitely old enough to know it\u2019s not okay to go on an online shopping spree with a parents credit card because you\u2019re bored. (My heart goes out to her for the medical stuff she\u2019s going through, so I\u2019m assuming this is new behavior from her, but she should still be treated like a \u2018regular teenager\u2019).", "NTA. $500 is perhaps affordable once, but if she is going to be bored for a long time, this can add up fast. If she is going to be recovering for a while, she is going to have to learn to cope without spending your money. What she is going through is tough for someone of any age, but she can\u2019t hurt you while doing it. The two of you will have to work together to figure something out.", "NTA. Boredom is no excuse for disrespectful behavior even if you do have cancer. Are there any hobbies she may be interested in taking up? Ones she can do from home.", "As someone who works with adult cancer patients who used to be childhood cancer patients.....NTA \n\nI'm assuming your goal is still to raise a responsible, accountable and healthy adult human. Giving in to everything out of guilt isn't helping anyone in this situation. If this wasn't an acceptable behavior beforehand it shouldn't be now.", "NTA - However you daughter seems to be struggling mentally.  She want from being very active to not being able to do much at all not to mention the Chemo.  \n\nI'd encourage you to find ways to spend her time and to be as active as possible.  Speak with her Doctors.  They may also be able to recommend a therapist to help her deal with whats going on with her body and health.  \n\nBest of luck to her and you!", "NTA\n\nShopping can add up pretty fast but it's not like she didn't know what she was doing or that cancer or boredom are an excuse. She just decided it was \"better to ask for forgiveness than permission.\"", "not an asshole but you need to teach your daughter the value of money", "Huge adjustments for sure, but what have either one of you done to help with the boredom? Why is she not social anymore? Can she not go out with friends? Can they not come over? Yes I know her immunity system is compromised, but surely things can be figured out so she\u2019s not so bored.", "NTA. This will be a good time for her to learn about finances? Would get her to stop being bored for a little while and she'll have a better understanding of money. You could do something like a type of game perhaps? Something she would find entertaining.\n\nEither way, you may want to teach her the value of a dollar sometime soon in the future. She'll benefit from it in the long run.", "NTA. She stole from you.", "Nta. It\u2019s extremely unfortunate she\u2019s going through this and i hope she gets better soon but that doesn\u2019t give anyone an excuse to buy stuff without asking. It\u2019s understandable she\u2019s bored though so that definitely needs to be addressed, maybe offer to buy her some craft stuff or something so she has a hobby", "INFO: Have you considered talking to your daughter about her feelings here? Regardless of who here is the asshole, if anybody, you cannot help her if you get upset when she's upset. It doesn't even seem like she's calling you an asshole, so I don't understand asking for our judgment here instead of just... talking to her and figuring it out.", "NAH. I think spoiling her a little right now is OK but you should be involved in the process since it\u2019s your money. You are not in the wrong at all for setting that boundary!\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s necessarily TA either though, as someone in their early 30s who also goes \u201cwell shit, where did all that money go this month?\u201d I can\u2019t hold it against a sick 16 year old for doing the same! Especially if she was sad/sorry for losing track of what she was spending.", "NTA. I am sorry she is sick.

It sounds like you have the money to the point where she was reasonable too. I don't think there is an actual conflict here. But I do wish only the best for you, and your daughter. I hope she is able to make a full and speedy recovery.\n\nSome mental healthcare is probably in order for your daughter as well. She is going through hell right now.", "Ooof. You are both in a hard place and trying to do the right thing. She wants to do something normal like shop. You want to ensure your child is raised with good financial awareness and doesn\u2019t use spending as a way to make herself feel better. You probably don\u2019t know how this cancer diagnosis will work out.  She probably knows you can afford her little spree. You aren\u2019t worried about money, just how your daughter is handling a tough situation. There\u2019s no easy answers. Just keep talking about all the difficult stuff like fear of a lifelong handicap or death. Don\u2019t ignore what she\u2019s saying, even if it\u2019s a shopping spree without asking first. That\u2019s a message too. Talk through the whys and the feelings.

Have a little grace for her.", "NTA, what she did is fraud, she's old enough to understand things cost money and that she should've asked first. I'm not heartless, I know she just got diagnosed with cancer but she needs to find better ways to process how she's feeling than spending money that isn't hers. Have you looked into getting therapy for her? A cancer diagnosis is rough, especially for someone as young as she is. If she doesn't want to talk to you about it, she still needs to talk to someone.\n\nIn the future, maybe the two of you could arrange a virtual shopping trip. Load up her favourite websites to shop from and the two of you could look through everything, basically as if you both were at the mall. Then you can buy her some of the things she likes.

Craft kits. For younger kids I would say things like klutz books but look on Etsy - candle making, sewing kits, crochet, cross stitch, weaving, and anything in that vein. Creating something tangible is really fulfilling when you're dealing with this especially as s kid that's used to being very active. \n\nStem and engineering type toys - think like updated Legos. Kits that are designed for slightly older kids ( but younger than your daughter) that are all about engaging those skills. I know I've seen ones that are like build your own table top pinball machine. \n\nIf she's a clothes person - maybe see if she can sell things online .

Without donated plasma and IVIG she wouldn't be here today. So...not to make this about my daughter...but to say, I get it, to a point.

My best advice to you, get both of you involved in a group near y'all of other Mom's and teenagers that are going through cancer. Why? Because those kids will GET IT!! Your daughters language is about to change too.

It makes me emotional! I am gaining weight!\" Then what I hated hearing was the kids comparing notes as the nurses accessed them then handed them, or at least the older ones, their meds in the syringes for them to administer the pre-meds themselves.

Went on fir about 6 to 8 months before I needed to get it looked at.    They went at it aggressively with chemo(inpatient and out patient with a take home pump) and radiation in preparation for an inevitable surgery.  Number one goal was to save me number two the leg.   Which they were able to do at first but with the bone and muscle tissue they had to cut away to clean up the cancer left me with about 30 to 50 percent use of my leg.   About a year later the cancer came back right behind my knee.  That time no chemo no radiation just surgery and the took the leg just above the knee with in weeks of the diagnosis.
