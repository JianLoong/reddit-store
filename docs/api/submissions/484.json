The other parties I went to were of my close friends'.\n\nSo here, my dad is  forcing me to invite Jack and James even though they are really small and the smallest person coming is Jen(F13).

I tried to talk to him that it is my special day and I should get to choose who to invite but he keeps saying if I don't invite them, then his reputation would be ruined(he is mainly reputed for sports in the neighborhood).\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:- Changed names from letters to fake names to make it easier to understand.", "created_utc": 1667216109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi96g4/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_some_people_to_my/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You invite who you want to invite. It's your day and your group of friends.\nFor sure it won't hurt to invite 2 more people, but if you don't want it you shouldn't be forced to have them there. If your dad wants a party with those 2 other kids then he can plan another party, not related to your anniversary, so the other kids can go.\nAnd just because you went to theirs party's, doesn't mean you have to invite them to yours.", "NTA,\nThey are a lot younger than you it be kinda weird them being at a birthday with a lot of teens and you said one of them will bring the mood down why invite someone who will just make your birthday a horrid day? Your dad needs to respect your wishes as 16 is a big step and he should start acknowledging you can make your own decisions as you are becoming an adult.", "NTA It's your special day", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
