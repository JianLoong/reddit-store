He was already living with my soon to be stepmother(now 49F). In my country it's common for people to live with their parents a bit deeper into adult life) \n\nAt first she was sweet. Around a year later my sister moved out and my SM and father got married. Right after that her behaviour shifted. She was treating me poorly behind his back and in front of him she would be a doll. So my father didn't understand when I started to avoid her and made assumptions that I was jealous which I was NOT.\n\nI tried to tell him that she was not being a nice person but he wouldn't believe it. \n She would play an evangelical song VERY LOUDLY outside my bedroom door saying \"GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, DEMON, GET OUT\". She once got to me laughing and said \" you are the little dog of the house, put your tail between your legs and obbey me because I own you\" \nShe convinced him that I took the devil home and this is what made my father lose a kidney.\n\nSo after awhile he threw me out because she made him chose between us. I went on to live alone. \n\nI was going through financial turmoils  Having had recovered the relationship with my mother she invited me to move in with her and my stepfather so I could save money for future plans.\n\nWe never had any conflict inside our home, and I both dearly. I reached out to my father and have been trying to rebuild a bond. \n\nSo I met and fell in love with my fiance (28M). We have a GREAT, sweet, and safe relationship.  Recently he received a job offer to another country and I knew I wanted to go along with him. So we are having a wedding to celebrate our love and to function as a farewell party. My mother approached me to say that she would be ok with me inviting my father to the wedding. \n\n Last week I arranged a meeting for him and my dad to meet. It was nice,  he said he was happy about all and and offered financial help with anything we needed (we declined). I decided to invite him. \n\nHe asked if the invitation extended itself to SM.\n\nI said that it didn't. And that I hoped he'd understand. He didn't. \n\nHe said that he wouldn't go without her. That I was being ridiculous about this situation, that what went on at his house was bullsh*t. I kept my foot down and he lost it. Started calling me ungrateful and listing all the things he paid for me along my life. He said that this would be the perfect opportunity for me to reconcile with his wife. \n\nI said this wasn't about them: It's about me and fiance. It's our wedding and we want around only people that love us. He said it's unfair that my mother can go with my stepfather and he would be alone.\n\nI kept my foot down. He made it clear he wouldn't go without her and that I am being childish and unreasonable. \n\nI am proud of myself for standing up but he IS my father, and asking myself if I'll regret this.

It is his decision to go to the wedding or not but if he doesn't, let him know that he will be missed.  Your life, future and happiness are your first priority.\n\nYou can always invite her but make sure she has no status at your wedding or reception.\n\nPersonally, I would stand by my decision to not invite drama at your wedding.  SM sounds very toxic. Tell him that you don't want a demon at your wedding. \n\nCongratulations and have a wonderful life.", "NTA. Why would you want someone who was mean to you, AND manipulated your father at your wedding?

He believes that you made all that up because you were jealous. Do you want to keep fighting this fight for the rest of his life? \n\nPlus, you're leaving the country anyway. Cultivating a relationship will take effort, on his side and yours. Given that his wife has convinced him to kick you out once, do you expect that he'll be willing to put in the work to develop a relationship while you're living your life abroad? Or will his wife convince him that going to visit you, or hosting you for a visit, isn't a good idea because you're still jealous of their relationship?\n\nabsolutely NTA.", "I'd be surprised if a single person thinks you're the AH here.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Your father already chose when he believed your SM over you and threw you out.

It's your wedding so it's your choice who is invited.", "NTA. Kicked you out of his house for his new wife. So he chose his spouse over his child. Why should you choose him over anybody?", "Nta he's being ridiculous it's your wedding you can have who you want there.\n\nJust go NC it seems SM has her claws in", "Definitely NTA.  \n\nIt's your father's fault for declining the invitation of coming alone.

Wish you loads of happiness \ud83e\udd42", "NTA\n\nThat man stopped being your father the moment he sided with his wife's treatment of you. Providing for you was his obligation, not a favour. \n\nWeddings aren't the place for reconciliations.

Then the onus is upon her to provide the apology for all the things she lied to your dad about doing to you.\n\nHave a lovely wedding.", "NTA", "NTA and you have nothing to feel regret for.
