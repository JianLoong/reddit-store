I happily obliged, as honestly I could use that break from socials. It went on for a few weeks, until one day I noticed he had a couple socials on his phone. When I asked, I wasn\u2019t angry, just confused, and he told me that sometimes he would download Discord to his phone while he was at work. Come to find out, he had been using all of the social media apps while at work then deleting them before he got home and pretending like it never happened. \nNow, to reiterate, I am not angry or upset at the fact he was using social media - I am upset at the fact he lied to me. He said that I\u2019m an asshole & that I am overreacting for being upset when it doesn\u2019t matter to me whether he uses social media or not.

He doesn't want his girlfriend to find out he got married.", "NTA. his request reeks of projection - he is being shady and wants you off because he assumes you would do the same as him. secondly he lied and broke the trust in your relationship and that is not easily repaired. you are right not to trust him, and its his own fault.", "NTA- This is isolating and potentially a red flag to abuse of behavior.\n\nIsolating your social media will limit your resources and access to friends and family.\n\nAnd he's not doing it himself.

You need to go get an STI panel done, and no sex until results are in and you choose next steps. If you want to try and work this out, you'll need couple's counseling at the very least. His actions have shattered any trust you have built in the relationship, and relationships only endure with trust.

I do agree that you are more calm about this then most other people would be. But I don't think his other partners were wrong to be angry either. \n\nAlso what he did  isn't just some dumb thing.

Isolating you from friends and family is classic abuser behavior, and it doesn't happen all at once. The fact that he didn't start behaving this way until you were married makes it even worse, IMO\u2014he waited to start limiting your contact with other people until after the point at which it would be a lot more difficult for you to leave the relationship.\n\nPlease be careful, especially if you notice things like him not wanting you to spend time with friends or family IRL. Everything you're experiencing right now is a big red flag.", "He wants to keep you off social media so you can't see what he's up to.", "He waited until he got you where he wanted you before he showed his true colors.

He\u2019s lashing out at you because he\u2019s projecting his own thoughts and behaviors and impulses on to you. \n\nNTA\n\nI\u2019d run far and fast. He is not trustworthy and is extremely manipulative.", "Am sorry for you... am sure it's a difficult situation for you right now. But trust is, in my opinion again the foundation of a good relationship. I do hope you he can change for the better and you both are able to work things out.", "If he's lying to his parents about stupid stuff that he has no reason to lie about, imagine what he's lying to you about.", "My ex started doing more and more drugs. He started with relatively innocent stuff I didn't mind (weed, shrooms, salvia), but when he found out I would have a problem with him taking lsd he just started doing everything behind my back. He ordered half a drug lab to our address and ended up addicted to alcohol and sleeping pills and tripping on lsd every 4 weeks. \n\nThe problem with lying and keeping secrets is that there's just no way to know how bad it is. I found out about the alcohol and almost a year later, when he was sober from that, found out it wasn't just alcohol. He'd only tell me about the stuff he knew I found out about, and just continue with the rest. I'll never know about all the stuff he was taking. \n\nYou will never ever know what he's up to. Doesn't matter what it is, unless he's absolutely sure you approve you will only know if you find out. And you will never find out about everything, you'll probably never know about 90% of his lies. And the more you find out, the less you will respect him. After a couple years, he will be a child to you. This isn't something you can repair. We went to couples counselling, therapist said we should break up but we were together over 10 years and in love. She ended up being right. Lying like that, you don't come back from it.\n\nHe would lie about everything by the way, not just the drugs, that was just the worst of it. He would also tell his friends he wasn't allowed to go out with them if he didn't feel like going, making them hate me without a reason. He once neglected to tell me when he was taking a trip with his friends untill 2 days before, so I wouldn't be able to take vacation days. I was invited to come, but he didn't want me there. It was his only vacation time during the summer so we just could not make any more plans together that summer..\n\nI'm so sorry to say this, but get out now.", "You can always get out before you start having children.", "Nope, that's some shady, shady behaviour.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019ll make sure to get on that.", "Thanks", "Also, and this is very important, try not to start a family with him too soon. That is another thing abusers do to make their partners stay in the relationship.", "Either that or he\u2019s purposefully trying to hide her from what he\u2019s doing online. Pretty easy to start having an affair when there\u2019s no presence of the wife online.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc", "I have imagined and it makes me nauseous.. I hate it here", "Holy cow. I resonate with your situation and I am so sorry you had to experience that. It\u2019s interesting you mentioned the other lies your significant other told, and it\u2019s crazy because mine tells similar lies. He tells his friends I\u2019m the reason he can\u2019t hang out, can\u2019t talk to them, etc. he wanted me to be a stay at home mom, yet lied to his friends about why I didn\u2019t work and said \u201cwell whatever makes her happy I guess\u201d.. it\u2019s interesting the more lies I am opening my eyes to just from hearing other people\u2019s experiences.  I agree. The more lies, the less respect\u2026 I\u2019m going to really think over this one.. thank you xx", "Good luck and stay strong! It was painful leaving him behind but I'm soooo much happier now. I had to start over at 32, you're even younger, you've got so many years left to spend happy (we both do). \n\nWhatever you decide, don't forget that you deserve to be happy.", ">he wanted me to be a stay at home mom, yet lied to his friends about why I didn\u2019t work and said \u201cwell whatever makes her happy I guess\u201d\n\nThis is also concerning. Why does he want you to be a stay at home mom? Are you a mom? Do you want to be a stay at home mom? When did you last work? Are you prepared to get a job in order to have the financial ability to escape if this thing goes south? \n\nIt sounds like he wants you to be dependent on him and is starting to isolate you from your loved ones, all while telling others you\u2019re the evil mastermind behind making him your sugar daddy who wants to cut him off from everyone. His true colors are coming out now that you\u2019re married and legally bound to him. If you want to or already have kids, do you want them to model your husband\u2019s behavior?"]}
