Might be the way to go if this crops up again. Can you requested a trained individual monitor the visits? You could sit in your car, or in a waiting room, and they'd get to see the child without you being in the room.\n\nFor years I worked at a childrens residential treatment center and many times had to go monitor a parent visitation. Most of the time that just meant I sat at the desk in the corner and continued on with my task involving auditing therapy notes, not really staring at the interactions. We did this because sure enough there were times when parents did or say abusive things, or showed up high or drunk and a social worker had to end the visit immediately.\n\nNTA - Sounds from here like you are those girl's guardian angel, doing what you need to do to protect them and help them thrive.", "NTA, but can\u2019t you sit in the hallway and if she has a seizure they can come and get you?
