{"id": 19263, "submission_id": "143yx8q", "title": "AITA for not babysitting my ex-husband\u2019s kid", "selftext": "Alt account for obvious reasons. My (30F) ex-husband (32M) and I have 2 children (4M, 2F). We have been divorced just about 6 months and he is now expecting a baby with his new girlfriend. I\u2019m admittedly not over him. We were together 10 years, my entire adulthood. It was and is a messy split. I\u2019m still bitter and hurt about it and he seems to have completely moved on somehow. When we had our oldest, neither of us wanted him in daycare (no judgement, we just didn\u2019t feel comfortable) so I stayed home and eventually started my own business that allows me to work 99% remotely. My parents are also local and retired and help me out as much as they can. This arrangement works for me and I get to spend time with both of my kids.\n\nNow, ex\u2019s girlfriend is 5 months pregnant and they got in a huge fight because she asked him to tour daycares and he said absolutely not, he wants her to stay home with the baby, none of his kids are to go in daycare (admittedly the ones here do suck). He called me to vent and I listened then he dropped the bomb. He asked if I would be willing to take care of their baby since I\u2019m home with our two and get help from my parents and when I have to take the kids to the office I can because I own it. He mentioned that I know how he feels about his kids in one of these daycares and I sort of lost it on him. It was a year and a half of walled up anger and hurt and I said some nasty things that I\u2019ve since apologized for. \n\nFast forward to 3 days later, new girlfriend pulled me to the side when I dropped off my kids to their house and asked why I was so ugly about it and why I thought my kids were better than hers and why her baby doesn\u2019t deserve the same things mine got. I never said that but apologized if anything I said came off like that, told her I\u2019m happy for them (I\u2019m not but, pleasantries) but was certainly not going to babysit their kid. She\u2019s a nurse so I get she can\u2019t work from home and doesn\u2019t want to give up her career but they should\u2019ve thought about that. \n\nI left before it blew up again but ex called me about 2 hours later and asked me to come get the kids because he and new girlfriend were fighting and he didn\u2019t want them around for it. I picked them up of course and ex texted me on the drive home and asked AGAIN if I would babysit for them for $200/week. I said no and he called me a bitter bitch and said I\u2019m being an asshole because I\u2019m hurt. I don\u2019t see it this way at all, I reiterated that the request is absurd and I would not be talking about it anymore.\n\nThis was yesterday and all day today new girlfriend has been texting me and having her friends and family review bomb my business. I\u2019m not worried about it, my clients know my work. Ex-husband hasn\u2019t said anything else but has been shorter with me in our conversations about our kids.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to keep my ex-husband\u2019s new baby?\n\nEdit/Update: Thank you for all the support in the comments. I probably can\u2019t reply to all questions but I will try to answer some as I come across them while I have some free time. A few of the repeat things I\u2019ve seen addressed below:\n\nIt looks like Google has flagged the influx of reviews for spam and I did call my lawyer to see what she recommends going forward. \n\nYes, my ex was cheating with his girlfriend for some time before we divorced, I don\u2019t know how long exactly and don\u2019t think I want to know. \n\nI\u2019m also a licensed professional so going against her nursing license is a sure fire way to make this worse, lawyer will advise on how to proceed. \n\nI don\u2019t mind if this is shared on social media, figured that comes with posting here.\n\nSecond and probably final update for now: Google is removing the reviews. Whackadoodle and her idiot family all have the same last name so it was pretty easy to see the reviews weren\u2019t genuine. The ones from her friends with different names were removed too because again, it was poorly executed at best. Ex has apologized for her behavior and apparently he is \u201ctaking some time away\u201d and she thought he was with me. I have no idea where he went after he left my house Tuesday night when the kids went to bed. He certainly is not staying here. We have only spoken to confirm pick up from swim lessons today. My parents had already planned to have the kids this weekend (ex has a graduation to go to and I am going to the beach with friends) so I don\u2019t have to worry about where they\u2019re going since ex is effectively homeless right now.", "created_utc": 1686197657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143yx8q/aita_for_not_babysitting_my_exhusbands_kid/", "score": 4619, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And be careful what you say or write to them - assume every single thing you write and say will eventually be read out loud in a courtroom.

Your ex and his GF are entitled, toxic assholes who are trying to extort you into taking responsibility for their child by threatening you and your livelihood.  This is the just tip of the iceberg of the issues you\u2019ll have with them, and the boundaries you\u2019re going to need to establish and enforce with them.  A therapist can help you organize your thoughts and develop a plan for that.  \n\nFinally, this is all a pretty big paradigm shift for you, especially since you don\u2019t feel completely \u201cover\u201d him yet.

They need to grow up and spend their time figuring this out instead of bothering you.\n\nYou may need to block their numbers and just use the parenting app. \n\nIf he's fighting with her in front of your kids, that's not your problem. Yes it affects the kids, but what happens when it's in front of his kid and your kids? Will he want you to take all of them? He needs to figure out how to handle his shit, be an adult, and learn some impulse control.\n\nI'm not sure how you can still love this guy, but he's using that to manipulate you.\n\nTalk to a lawyer and get a cease and desist letter about the business reviews. So her friends and family can \"help\" her by leaving fake reviews, but they can't help with child care?\n\nOne final note: narcissists control women by getting them pregnant and isolating them. Wanting you and her to quit working because of child care sounds noble, but it's isolating, and gives him control over the money. He did that to you, and you got away, and now he's doing that to her.", "Tell him you are pregnant, the new baby daddy is not in the picture, and you need him and his girlfriend to watch your newborn every second that they have your other kids so that you can run your business and have some alone time. See how he reacts to that.", "Yeah both of them are in the wrong. \n\n1- keep your cool. \n\n2- keep as many as your communications in writing as possible and maintain those records.  \n\n3- report the review bombs and save all the negative reviews.\n\nNTA and all of this is the beginning not the end. Prepare to save all evidence of well all of it.", "Your ex sounds like a lunatic and his crazy baby mama ain't playing with a full deck either.  NTA, his problems are not your concern.", "NTA.

He made the bed, it's time for him to lie in it.", "And if you\u2019re struggling to keep your spine shiny then picture this - you\u2019re at home dealing with a screaming baby with colic or reflux, that isn\u2019t yours and you don\u2019t care for. They\u2019ve taken the afternoon off, quiet glass of wine, music on, start making another baby for you to look after, having a right laugh at your expense! Keep that picture in your head every time they ask!!", "NTA ex and his girlfriend obviously living in a fantasy world. Expecting you and your parents to care for his second family is crazy.\n\nYou made a sacrifice for you child because it was what you and your ex both wanted. That doesn't not mean you have an obligation to provide the same for children he has with someone else.\n\nThis is up to them to find a childcare solution that works for them. You said no. that is a complete sentence.\n\nkeep copies of all the review and spamming her friends and family are doing incase you need to take action to stop their behaviour.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nTwo things:\n\n* Start preparing for the inevitable breakup between them. Document everything, especially custody changes (like you taking over because of their fight). Your ex got involved with somebody completely incompatible with, got her pregnant within a month after the divorce, and has already cheated on her. Obviously he's just using her for childcare. You're ex is going to introduce a revolving door of bang-nanny's into your children's life (+ the occasional half-sibling). Start documenting now and decide what to do about it later.\n* Stop discussing irrelevant things with your ex and your ex's sphere of influence, like his childcare problems, or his relationship problems, or what you think his new baby deserves. In fact, don't answer the phone and don't engage in in-person conversations at all. Let it go to voicemail, craft an email response, let it rest for a few hours, look over your emails response, delete everything irrelevant, and then send it. Don't justify, argue, explain or defend. You've already done a good job in the whole childcare discussion: despite nasty insults, you didn't discuss your reasons or motivation for refusing, but just said \"No\". If a girlfriend of him contacts you again, email back: \"Please don't contact me. All communication about the children of ex and me should go through ex.\"", "NTA, hopefully this entitled behavior by him and his new gf is helping you get over him faster.  Good for you standing your ground.  Would individual counseling or a support group help you move on?  A half dozen or so sessions helped me when I broke it off with my ex.  Also helped rip my blinders off where he was concerned.  I was able to develop healthier ways of dealing with him.", "NTA and get a lawyer to write a cease and desist letter. You are not obligated to watch your ex's new children. The fact that they're pregnant and can't figure themselves out speaks volumes about the quality of their relationship.", "Holy fucking entitlement wtf is wrong with some people. Keep all the texts, tell them to delete the reviews or you'll sue for defamation.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA.  Their childcare issues are not your issues,   You have no obligation here and they both need to get over being so entitled and greedy. $200 a week are they real.", "NTA. The fact that they even had the audacity to ask, let alone get mad at you for saying no is unbelievable.\n\n\nThe fact that they think this is a reasonable thing to ask of you is a good sign that it\u2019s past time you put some boundaries between you and them. Block new gf\u2019s number and only speak to ex if it\u2019s in regards to *your* kids. No more listening to him venting about his relationship because again, you are the least appropriate person he could be having those kinds of conversations with.

Turn notifications off from your ex for the next couple of days. It blows my mind how entitled some people are.", "\"Asked why I thought my kids were better than hers and why her baby doesn\u2019t deserve the same things mine got\"\n\nWhoa, stop right there. You rearranged your life to give your kids time at home with their mother, yourself. If she really wants her kid to have the same as your kids, she can rearrange her own life to give her kid time at home with its mother, herself. Or your ex can be the stay at home dad. \n\nFrom your wording of the divorce it sounds like he chose to leave you. You are not your exe's wife anymore, but somehow he's expecting that he can have a stay at home wife to look after this child, while also having a working wife bringing in a second income into his household. Ask them both, am I your wife? Am I part of a threesome here? Why are you, a single mother now, expected to work and raise your own kids and maintain your own household, but also contribute unpaid labour to their household to support their parenting choices and financial prosperity as well?", "In the UK professional childminders need background checks and are subject to inspection. Maybe it would help to point out all the legal and tax implications as one of the reasons why what they are asking is unrealistic.", "NTA", "NTA. But it sounds like you need to be more assertive.

I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "NTA. So your ex leaves you for another woman, knocks her up, and still relies on you for emotional support?

If you haven't already, you should definitely get a court order in place to protect yourself and your kids from their crazy. I'm sorry you're going through this when you're still not 100% over him, but he should not be venting to you about any of his partners/problems. This is crossing a line of him still relying on you emotionally when you clearly don't get the same emotional support from him.

You owe that baby nothing.\n\nPlease write a down a numbered list of of all the things he did and apparently still does to you. Every time you start to feel the fuzzies, READ THE LIST!\ud83d\ude21Feel THOSE feelings!!\n\nPlease reevaluate your coparenting style. The current one isn\u2019t helping you. \u201cBut the kids!?\u201d Yes, exactly!! Your kids need you! Not just physically but mentally and emotionally as well. You can\u2019t give your babies all of you if you still have feelings for the man that cheated, lied and hurt you.  He created this situation and he still gets to play daddy and head of household for two homes, two women, and soon two sets of kids/kid. You can coparent without going to this degree where he comes to your home. DO YOU TUCK YOUR KIDS IN AT NIGHT WHEN THEY STAY AT HIS HOUSE?!\nSet up more stringent boundaries. I understand your children are young and your heart breaks at what they\u2019re going through, but you\u2019ve both agreed to not yell in front of them. That\u2019s a great start! Many children don\u2019t even get that. Your kids already know there\u2019s another woman, another house, soon another kid. They already feel what they are going to feel. Stop ex from coming into your home. You can meet them at the door at drop off and say goodbye to him.This current situation plus him knowing you still have feelings for him is what is giving him permission to push boundaries (though not really, because where are the boundaries?). He complains about his mistress to the woman he left for her?! He asks you babysit the mistress\u2019s child!! \n\nLady!! The people in this comment section are on your side and yes, your babies\u2019 side. We want you to heal and grow. Become someone who people like your ex and his mistress, would never even let the thought to ask you to babysit ever enter their tiny minds because they KNOW. They know you are strong and mighty and would never be disrespected like that.\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\n\nI wish you peace.\ud83d\udc97", "All of this AND, if ex is saying nothing about what she and her family are doing then he must condone the harassment. \n\nOP, was your husband having an affair with this woman while you were married?  Divorced 6 months and she's already pregnant?  Seems a bit suspicious.  \n\nAnyway, the audacity of your ex and his new GF to think you would watch his new baby is mind blowing.  I think you've been quite polite about the situation. You owe neither of them nothing. I really hope this behavior helps you to get over him because it's obvious he's not worth a moment of your time.  \n\nNTA", "There's no one right answer, because everyone has different nuances. This person's take is bizarre to me, because I don't see how they think you're handling this wrong. You aren't fighting in front of the kids, or denying they're father access, or alienating them against their dad or his affair partner. You appear to simply be drawing a reasonable and healthy boundary. You aren't a daycare, you're a mother. If she wants her baby to have the \"same thing\", then she can make the same sacrifices you did.", "The best part, if the girlfriend wanted \"the same treatment\" for her kid/relationship then she should be expecting the next affair partner to come within a year or so. \n\nIs the gf so special she thinks she won't get cheated on?\n\nPoor OP, I hope she can get them scared straight and puts a health distance away from her ex.", "Oh, thank you, I did read that, I just didn\u2019t put 2 and 2 together.", "I bet someone a case of beer....Shiner Bock....that he is cheating on his pregnant GF. He isn't homeless, he is just hooking up with his new side piece.", "NTA but you need to end the joint account right now. He will start using the money dedicated for your kids for his new baby. Do not add money into this account any more. \n\nHe already thinks it\u2019s your responsibility to help with childcare so it\u2019s not far of a stretch for him to think you should help pay for his kid. \n\nYou sound like you are doing what\u2019s best four your kids and what is best for your self.", "In my area (NYC) its $200 *a day* maybe for an infant under 6 months. Not per week.\n\nAnd don't forget, OP has a 2 year old already. And a 4 year old - who might be in PreK but likely only for a few hours a day, so there's a  drop off and pick up to deal with, which means packing up the toddler for a walk. Adding a newborn is not an easy task.", ">since ex is effectively homeless right now.\n\nplease do not let that man stay in your home, keep putting yourself first bb", "NTA- it is not your responsibility to watch their kid. That\u2019s just like the celebrity couple now (the hip hop abusive couple.) he told his BM that he was taking the baby from Rock and she was going to take care of their baby and she said absolutely not. It is her baby that she will take care of. Rock never said anything about her doing this , it was Blue saying he was taking the baby away from her.  This is all wrong. You are not obligated to do that at all. It is their responsibility to take care of their child. Not yours.", "NTA but also you need to stop letting your ex vent to you about his current relationship. You probably need to only talk about your shared children. Eventually maybe you can be friends but not when it\u2019s all so new and raw.", "NTA. He should\u2019ve thought about how important it was to have his kids stay at home before making a kid with someone else. This is the consequences to his own\nactions, please let him suffer through them. If he doesn\u2019t want his kids in daycare, why doesn\u2019t he stay home with them?", "GF asked OP \"why I thought my kids were better than hers and why her baby doesn\u2019t deserve the same things mine got\"\n\nSimple answer to that question is 1. the reason that your kids are better is because you're their mother, and 2. it isn't your responsibility to make sure that their child has what yours does.  Maybe if GF learned more about the married man that she was sleeping with while THEY ruined his family, she would know what she would be sacrificing to have his child. \n\nOP NTA, and ex and GF are!", "It\u2019s no surprise that she has this entitled attitude. Because she sure felt entitled to you husband/ex when y\u2019all were still together. She is Homewrecking trash and has absolutely no empathy or care for anyone else. I\u2019m glad things have seemed to work out for you. Don\u2019t back down. It\u2019s not your responsibility to care for his affair baby. Maybe they should have thought about that while they were cheating.", "To cover your back legally, don't look after the kid.", "Oh, sweetie.  You need a hug.  If you did this out of spite, you would still deserve a hug.  Being asked to keep you ex's adulterous child is just wacky.   You are so lucky to be rid of him.  You need to just tell this people that they are batshit crazy to expect you to keep you ex's kid.  BATSHIT is the kind, mature word to use here.", "Such a good point here!! HE created the entire situation by impregnating her and then insisting no daycare\u2026then manipulated it so to new GF, it\u2019s OP fault!", "Absolutely not. He\u2019ll probably go to his dad\u2019s house or something.", "Omg not Blueface and Crisean. I\u2019ve blocked out all things related to their drama a while ago after my TikTok algorithm kept showing me their content.", "Him getting another girl pregnant within 6 months and then telling her she has to give up her career and stay home is both trashy, misogynistic, and controlling. Should help you get over him, sorry how things went down.", "y\u2019all need to only communicate about the kids, there\u2019s apps that are for this. your personal life and his is not something y\u2019all should be discussing", "Holy shit this guy is such trash. \n\nIf I was petty, I'd make certain she knew about that.", "NTA. Thank goodness you know in your heart you are \u2018done\u2019 with him and that what you and he once had together is gone forever. He needs to learn the same damn thing : The days when you jumped to accommodate his whims and wishes are DONE. He can\u2019t expect you to be his partner for anything other than co-parenting your children.  He can\u2019t expect you to provide childcare for his baby with another woman. Nor even to  run over to his residence to pick up your kids during his parenting time so he can have an argument with his girlfriend. He can\u2019t expect services or favors from you. He can\u2019t expect you to serve him a glass of ice tea nor expect you to let him chill out on your couch because his gf is mad at him. It can take a long time for both parties to adjust to new healthy boundaries for a relationship that has changed from spouse to co-parent.", "It is like he still expects you to take over all the work and responsibility for having kids, even when he is having one with this new partner, while he can just go around and f\\*ck around.", "ooooooo I hate him! I'm so sorry that this man has put you through so much and manipulated your feelings like this. Try not to let him continue to do so. I know it's hard and painful. Do what you need to do to protect yourself, your career, and your two children.", "OP, from the bottom of my heart, I'm so happy that you got out of this relationship. He was playing both sides. I'm sure he did have feelings for you still, truly, but he made some awful choices. I feel bad for the new gf. She's getting the short end of the stick with this guy and the relationship seems to have started poorly. Take the time you need. Hugs.", "You have a great attitude, I'm impressed!\n\nWith that said, start working on keeping your ex outside the home. He can do movie night at his house. You need to reclaim that home as your own. He can meet the kids at the door.", "It sounds like he's using his positive relationship to your kids as a foot in the door, to continue stoking your feelings for him in order to advantage of you. \n\nYes, your kids think he's great. But he is also trying to coerce you to take on the *newborn baby he's having with the woman who broke up your family*, and is totally okay with his gf harassing you, and her family review-bombing your business that is helping support his kids. \n\nYou are giving him WAY more respect for doing the bare minimum of *acting* like a decent dad to his kids (while not paying you support), and not seeing how he does not REMOTELY extend the same respect to you. He's stoking your lingering feelings for him and you're letting that blind you to how he's actually treating you.\n\nActions speak louder than words. Consider this exact scenario being played out with one of your friends instead of yourself, and how you might see it as an impartial observer. How mindblowingly CRUEL and CALLOUS it is for any man to make his heartbroken ex watch his AFFAIR BABY. How little regard he has for her feelings! How he stands by and allows his new partner and her entire family to publicly shame and bully the mother of his children, when he could stop it all by putting his foot down. How he is only offering her peanuts to watch a newborn baby (whose very existence breaks her heart) because that's how much her time is worth.", "I hate to be that guy, but he is not as good  a dad as you think.\n\nThe main job of a parent is to role model good behavior. He has already modeled cheating, name calling, manipulation, and complete lack of planning.\n\nHe is using you, and his new GF.", "You are naive and frankly dumb. What is the child support situation? I think you screwed yourself in the divorce and went way too easy on him. was sleeping with him up until two months ago when you found out that his girlfriend was pregnant. You are lucky you have parents to fall back on. Scorched earth is only way to deal with cheaters.", "Good. Whatever bed Ex ends up in, he'll have to lie in because he made it - all by himself. And GF deserves whatever your lawyer can hand her for the harassment she initiated against you. Keep your head high, OP! You and your little ones deserve none of this; in time, I'm sure better things will come your way.", "It reminded of me what they put on news two days ago. He said that on live with his BM and she was not okay with it at all. He can\u2019t take that child away from her anyway especially when he didn\u2019t want it to begin with. But he was dead serious about his BM taking care of their child and raising it. Like whatttt? Hell no. And you don\u2019t need to take care of your ex and his gf\u2019s child or babysit them. It is not your job or duty.", "You made some mistakes that a lot of people make during a divorce. I know I did. But as it seems you are, I smartened up and made sure I was taking care of my emotional health and not the cheating ahole\u2019s. Talk to your lawyer and they should give you the peace of mind that there is nothing he can do to take the kids from you. Good luck", "Also, a judge will not look kindly on this level of hostility. It could affect ex\u2019s visitation. He needs to get his life sorted.  NTA", "I suggest they both run off to Vegas and get married. Sounds like they deserve each other.", "Yes. I think having good communication and co parenting well is amazing and I wish my parents had done it but OP is, admittedly, not over him. I think having movie nights in the house with the kids and her blurs lines and makes things more complicated. I think he is overstepping and trying to take advantage of the situation and she is letting him because she has so many emotions here. It\u2019s probably also confusing for the kids. There should be more boundaries.", "Fair. I probably shouldn\u2019t have been so accommodating. I didn\u2019t intend for the divorce to be a fight, I just wanted a clean way out, still didn\u2019t get one but you live and you learn. I wasn\u2019t *sleeping* with him up until that point, we had sex ONCE. Once and never again AFTER we were divorced. I don\u2019t have parents to \u201cfall back on\u201d. I\u2019m self sufficient with my kids and my life. My parents love their grandchildren and only keep them if I need a weekend here or there or have an appointment for myself or something. Otherwise they are with one of us.", "I\u2019m not so sure about that. Of course he wanted that, but he also obviously wants access to her emotional and domestic labor.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he was trying to win her back through merit as much as simply feeling entitled to all of the benefits of their relationship and knowing that OP is bad at enforcing boundaries.", "You seem very grounded and mature in this and all of your responses. Well done.", "Prosecuted? This is not a criminal matter.", "Fair enough, but then the new Wife shouldn't be asking or expecting the previous Wife to watch her kid and becoming indignant when she doesn't want to. And a Research Nurse can easily make 100k a year and be completely distant from patients, it is possible. Maybe she doesn't want to do it, that is fine. But she shouldn't expect someone else to do it, especially the ex. Who would want a recent ex-spouse to watch their newborn? That makes zero sense.", "\ud83e\udd23 wow he played you like a fiddle. Even got a sweetheart deal on child support. no wonder he was playing you sleeping with you, getting your hopes on reconciliation.", "Please, please, please: Get rid of the joint account. He has repeatedly shown you that he cannot be trusted. Divorce is really fucking hard, but it\u2019s harder when you maintain those ties. Y\u2019all are now coparents, nothing more.", "It actually is, Google has and will prosecute folks who intentionally review bomb businesses. Especially if it is a competitor fraudulently attacking the business. Otherwise Google suffers because it cannot be seen as an accurate source of information.", "As the child of divorced parents, you need to get custody and child support in writing. Close the joint account. Things that need to be decided for child support - who carries medical insurance, how medical bills are split, school fees, extra curricular activities, clothes, any other things I\u2019m currently forgetting. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re doing your best to co-parent. There will be ups and downs in this journey. It\u2019s really best to have everything squared away from who gets the kids on birthdays/holidays to who pays for braces and prom dresses. \n\nYou\u2019ve said he\u2019s lied to his girlfriend about his finances and she\u2019s unhappy about things. You never know when she or someone else will convince him that he doesn\u2019t need to help with school supplies or something else in the future. They\u2019ll say they have an extra kid and you can afford it blah blah. Get it all ironed out now! It may be a headache to do it now, but it will save you from a migraine later on.", "I don't mean to drag you, it seems you've been in a tough spot and he's been toying with you. Hopefully this is a good wake up call and you focus on yourself and your kids as much as possible.", "And after she had an affair with OP's husband..."]}
