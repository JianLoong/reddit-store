My (30F) ex-husband (32M) and I have 2 children (4M, 2F). We have been divorced just about 6 months and he is now expecting a baby with his new girlfriend. I\u2019m admittedly not over him. We were together 10 years, my entire adulthood. It was and is a messy split. I\u2019m still bitter and hurt about it and he seems to have completely moved on somehow. When we had our oldest, neither of us wanted him in daycare (no judgement, we just didn\u2019t feel comfortable) so I stayed home and eventually started my own business that allows me to work 99% remotely. My parents are also local and retired and help me out as much as they can. This arrangement works for me and I get to spend time with both of my kids.\n\nNow, ex\u2019s girlfriend is 5 months pregnant and they got in a huge fight because she asked him to tour daycares and he said absolutely not, he wants her to stay home with the baby, none of his kids are to go in daycare (admittedly the ones here do suck). He called me to vent and I listened then he dropped the bomb. He asked if I would be willing to take care of their baby since I\u2019m home with our two and get help from my parents and when I have to take the kids to the office I can because I own it. He mentioned that I know how he feels about his kids in one of these daycares and I sort of lost it on him. It was a year and a half of walled up anger and hurt and I said some nasty things that I\u2019ve since apologized for. \n\nFast forward to 3 days later, new girlfriend pulled me to the side when I dropped off my kids to their house and asked why I was so ugly about it and why I thought my kids were better than hers and why her baby doesn\u2019t deserve the same things mine got. I never said that but apologized if anything I said came off like that, told her I\u2019m happy for them (I\u2019m not but, pleasantries) but was certainly not going to babysit their kid. She\u2019s a nurse so I get she can\u2019t work from home and doesn\u2019t want to give up her career but they should\u2019ve thought about that. \n\nI left before it blew up again but ex called me about 2 hours later and asked me to come get the kids because he and new girlfriend were fighting and he didn\u2019t want them around for it. I picked them up of course and ex texted me on the drive home and asked AGAIN if I would babysit for them for $200/week. I said no and he called me a bitter bitch and said I\u2019m being an asshole because I\u2019m hurt. I don\u2019t see it this way at all, I reiterated that the request is absurd and I would not be talking about it anymore.\n\nThis was yesterday and all day today new girlfriend has been texting me and having her friends and family review bomb my business. I\u2019m not worried about it, my clients know my work. Ex-husband hasn\u2019t said anything else but has been shorter with me in our conversations about our kids.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to keep my ex-husband\u2019s new baby?", "created_utc": 1686197657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143yx8q/aita_for_not_babysitting_my_exhusbands_kid/", "score": 1345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would no longer consider your co-parenting relationship to be amicable anymore, so you need to raise your mental and emotional drawbridge around them, and take some proactive steps to protect yourself and your kids. \n\nFirst, start by saving and backing up ALL communications you have with them from now on.  Avoid phone conversations and shift as much as you can to be over written forms, like texts and email.  If there is a call, start keeping a log of them.  Keep that log factual, not editorial (so date + time + name + summary of what was said, without adding any opinions in).  And be careful what you say or write to them - assume every single thing you write and say will eventually be read out loud in a courtroom.  Also assume that the court will eventually request and review all your financial records, and plan accordingly (like if you decide to buy something from somewhere you\u2019d prefer not to be publicized, like from an adult store for example, then pay with cash).\n\nThen make an appointment to talk to an attorney (the one that handled your divorce would be a good place to start).  \n1.

Have them send some scary-looking lawyer cease and desist letters to the brigaders.

Your ex and his GF are entitled, toxic assholes who are trying to extort you into taking responsibility for their child by threatening you and your livelihood.

He\u2019ll have a better option to nope out to if either you or her get too demanding. All the hassle and drama of a poly V without the benefits.", "Or op start going to your ex gf workplace and speak loudly enough for everyone to hear that you told her NO you are NOT babysitting her child and no matter how much she and her friends harass you and spread lies about your work you will not change your mind.\n\nA taste of her own medicine and embarrassment at work should get her a taste of reality. She's doing the same after all to you", "I think you\u2019re potentially ignoring major red flags about this man and not setting up boundaries that are now impacting your livelihood. His parental rights do not extend to having to unload his emotional garbage with his current partner on you.", "I believe that calling OP back on a whim to get the kids, all because \u201cof what you did\u201d, to be a red flag. OP is acting like the parent, while the father is acting like a babysitter. OP shouldn\u2019t be expected to shuttle the kids back and forth at the father\u2019s whim.", "Likely both", "Fair enough", "u/marsupialthin7679 is a bot.", "u/inner_surprise_1227 is a bot.", "Dude needs a vasectomy.\nAlso dude needs to hire a nanny (with full benefits)", "Oh no! The world would completely end if he had to lift his finger out his arse!! \n\n/s \ud83e\udd23", "Happy Cake Day!\n\nAlso yep! And the fact EX had sex with OP *while still with* the new girlfriend.", "Nobody decides to get a divorce and then *is* divorced by literally the next day. Obviously they were separated for a period of time before the divorce was finalized.", "My nieces get $35/hr babysitting\u2026 OP should hold out for that.", "Yeah a note from the lawyer to take down their comments will do the trick. They are AH, OP. Don't associate yourself anymore with them. You're better off with that ex.", "I feel like that would be a good child support case. He bombed my business, so now I can't feed the kids or pay bills", "I mean, look at the kind of people the ex and the new one are. I am not surprised the people around them are quicker to hurl insults than offer a hand.", "It's ridiculous, but OP needs to get further away from this trash fire, not wade deeper into it. Whoever these flying monkeys are, the real problem is the witch and the ex.\n\nSorting the problem through google may be low effort, but OP please get a legal letter sent. I'm a change management specialist - and one thing I know is, problems are only solved when everybody involved in making them go away feels some pain if they don't. If you don't make this attack bite her, she will do it again, or find some other way to vent. She probably has a lot of anger towards you, feeling you might steal her new love, that you're undermining them etc. The fact she has no boundaries to see their request you provide free daycare is ridiculous makes her more dangerous and makes it more important you push back at least a little.\n\nI'm sorry you are still hurting, and your ex f\\*\\*\\*\\*d this up so spectacularly. Have a separate (short) conversation with your ex about if he really wants the two families to fight, and what that would do to your shared children. Get him to put pressure on his new gf to stop with the harassment, so his children don't grow up to hate their father.", "Single hard working mom of two really young children as well!!! Her kids aren\u2019t older teenagers who are pretty much self sufficient, they are two and four years old! That\u2019s a lot of work right there already.\n\nOP definitely isn\u2019t TA.", "You can reply to the review, at least.", "I agree OP needs to set boundaries like yesterday. Only talk about the kids and leave it at that. This guy is trash and would play both of you if you let him. His new gf his new business. They both have no respect for you.", "Right! Well OP decided to stat home with her kids and start a business, if new girl or his side piece wants the same she can provide that for her kids. The fact that she thinks OP will watch their kid is absolutely delusional. Parenthood is her own responsibility and if she can\u2019t provide the lifestyle she wants for that child it\u2019s on her. OP you need to cut contact with them and specifically have contact with ex regarding YOUR OWN children.", "Honestly I feel like the answer to \"why do your kids deserve better than mine?\" should be, \"because they're *my* kids so *I* work to give them better. Why aren't *you* working to give *your* kid better?\"", "You are so arrogant making such sweeping statements based on so little data.", "I'm sure in OP's ex's view, he had a nanny with full benefits. Now he wants his girlfriend to be the same, and when he can't have that, he wants the benefits and for OP to be the nanny.\n\nI know that's not the kind of 'benefits' you meant, but I couldn't resist.", "I get this feeling he's too poor to afford a nanny tbh, that's why he's so focused on day care. Especially if he's only offering 200 a week. Cheap skate from hell.", "A vasectomy would cost money they could put to better use paying for professional childcare. I'd suggest a cheap, quick and far more painful process using a couple of bricks.", "Thanks!\nYa I just saw the comment before I got your reply \ud83e\udd22 this dude just keeps getting worse and worse. Such a manipulative ahole!", "More.  Tell him that he needs to cover insurance and changing the schedules and so forth.  About $75 an hour should cover it all.", "*withOUT that ex.\n\n\nFTFY :)", "Well, he did already call OP to pick up kids during his time just so he can have a conversation with his new baby mama. That is a major sign of using OP. HUGE manipulation. He has so much disdain and disrespect for OP, but OP is naive enough to think he did that because he cared about the children. There are others he could\u2019ve called.", "FR.\n\n$200/wk for a newborn is way way too damn little.\nDude still needs to be snipped, his whizzing in the gene pool is not good.", "Disagree. Not letting the kids listen to an argument can be a great reason. Glad he and OP are more mature about it than people in this thread."]}
