My (30F) ex-husband (32M) and I have 2 children (4M, 2F). We have been divorced just about 6 months and he is now expecting a baby with his new girlfriend. I\u2019m admittedly not over him. We were together 10 years, my entire adulthood. It was and is a messy split. I\u2019m still bitter and hurt about it and he seems to have completely moved on somehow. When we had our oldest, neither of us wanted him in daycare (no judgement, we just didn\u2019t feel comfortable) so I stayed home and eventually started my own business that allows me to work 99% remotely. My parents are also local and retired and help me out as much as they can. This arrangement works for me and I get to spend time with both of my kids.\n\nNow, ex\u2019s girlfriend is 5 months pregnant and they got in a huge fight because she asked him to tour daycares and he said absolutely not, he wants her to stay home with the baby, none of his kids are to go in daycare (admittedly the ones here do suck). He called me to vent and I listened then he dropped the bomb. He asked if I would be willing to take care of their baby since I\u2019m home with our two and get help from my parents and when I have to take the kids to the office I can because I own it. He mentioned that I know how he feels about his kids in one of these daycares and I sort of lost it on him. It was a year and a half of walled up anger and hurt and I said some nasty things that I\u2019ve since apologized for. \n\nFast forward to 3 days later, new girlfriend pulled me to the side when I dropped off my kids to their house and asked why I was so ugly about it and why I thought my kids were better than hers and why her baby doesn\u2019t deserve the same things mine got. I never said that but apologized if anything I said came off like that, told her I\u2019m happy for them (I\u2019m not but, pleasantries) but was certainly not going to babysit their kid. She\u2019s a nurse so I get she can\u2019t work from home and doesn\u2019t want to give up her career but they should\u2019ve thought about that. \n\nI left before it blew up again but ex called me about 2 hours later and asked me to come get the kids because he and new girlfriend were fighting and he didn\u2019t want them around for it. I picked them up of course and ex texted me on the drive home and asked AGAIN if I would babysit for them for $200/week. I said no and he called me a bitter bitch and said I\u2019m being an asshole because I\u2019m hurt. I don\u2019t see it this way at all, I reiterated that the request is absurd and I would not be talking about it anymore.\n\nThis was yesterday and all day today new girlfriend has been texting me and having her friends and family review bomb my business. I\u2019m not worried about it, my clients know my work. Ex-husband hasn\u2019t said anything else but has been shorter with me in our conversations about our kids.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to keep my ex-husband\u2019s new baby?", "created_utc": 1686197657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143yx8q/aita_for_not_babysitting_my_exhusbands_kid/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
