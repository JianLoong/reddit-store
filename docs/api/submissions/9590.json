Throwaway account!\n\nI (49M) have a son, Chris, who is eleven, and refuses to grow up it seems. He's entering middle school next year and it's starting to worry me that he has not figured out that Santa, the Easter bunny, elf on the shelf, etc. aren't real. My wife, Jenna 47F, assures me that it's not a big deal, since his sister Maggie (9F) hasn't caught on yet either.\n\nFor those who don't know, the Elf on the Shelf is essentially this tradition where an elf doll comes to watch the kids during Christmastime, and at night flies to the North Pole to report their behavior to Santa, and goes on Christmas Eve. We've been doing this since the kids were little, and I have always found it bizarre but Jenna thinks it's fun.\n\nAbout 3 years ago, Jenna found that there's a part of the Elf on the Shelf tradition where the elf can come visit for birthdays, according to their website. She bought a tiny party hat for the elf, and he has come to visit the kids on their birthdays for about since then, and brings a present with him.\n\nA week ago, Chris told us he wanted a very specific toy of the solar system and gave us the name of it. I googled the toy and couldn't find it on Amazon, eBay, Marketplace, or anywhere else. I did more research and it seems like the toy has not been manufactured since the late 90s or so, so I knew there was no chance he was getting it.\n\nThat night at dinner, Chris told us how confident he was that the Elf would bring him this planet model. Jenna tried to warn him that the Elf might have trouble getting it, to which my daughter said that Santa can get people whatever they want. I gave my wife a glance, but she shook her head.\n\nA few days before today, I ordered some glow-in-the-dark planets that hang from the ceiling off of Amazon.\n\nToday, when he woke up, the Elf was not there but Jenna assured him he would be there when he got home. While he was at school, Jenna wrapped his gifts including the planets, and put out the Elf with its party hat.\n\nFast forward to his birthday celebration with our family at night, it's time to open presents and Chris grabs the present next to the Elf, and opens it with excitement but to his horror he hasn't gotten the gift he wanted. He looks upset.\n\nJenna tells him that like she said, sometimes the Elf can't always get everyone what they want. He starts saying that he wanted the planet model he saw online and whining. I pull him aside into the other room, away from his sister, and quietly say to him that the Elf isn't real, nor Santa, Easter Bunny, etc., and that I tried looking for the toy online, and because of when it was last made it was probably impossible to find. He ran upstairs in tears.\n\nNow Jenna is pissed at me, saying I've ruined the holidays plus his birthday for him. I honestly feel kinda bad but I also don't want my kid going to middle school believing in Santa.\n\nReddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1675994070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yd2s5/aita_for_telling_my_son_the_elf_on_the_shelf/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I couldn\u2019t imagine how it would be feel to be told this abruptly AND on a day of celebration. I don\u2019t think you handled it right at all but I do think he had to know", "ESH \n\n\nYou're right. He's going to have trouble at 11 believing these things. I work in an elementary school and see my fair share of Santa arguments. He's definitely gonna hear kids talking about how their little siblings still believe. \n\n\nYour wife needs to understand that he's 11. There's a balance between making kids grow up too fast, and making them aware of some realities. He also needs critical thinking skills. There's nothing wrong with continuing the tradition, having \"presents from Santa,\" etc, knowing that it's all in good fun. I think Jenna isn't ready to accept this.\n\n\nBut you picked the absolute worst time. Pulled him away during birthday celebration. And without warning your wife, even if she didn't agree with you.", "NTA.  The whole Santa elf on a shelf stuff is pretty bogus. I told my kids that Santa wasn\u2019t real, just the spirit of Christmas and that people liked to dress up as Santa which was why there were so many different looking santas. At same time I also told them that if they met kids who believed in Santa they didn\u2019t need to tell them the truth.", "Ok here\u2019s my honest opinion\u2026 parents who work really hard to lie to their children that Santa is real are kinda AH", "YTA for doing it the way you did it.  But you aren't TA for doing it.  He doesn't need to grow up the whole way at age 11, but it's time to drop the Santa gig at that point and recognize that its his parents' hard work and care that puts presents under the Christmas tree.  Personally, I think going past the age of 5 or 6 is fundamentally wrong with regard to Santa.  It's important that kids understand the true nature of reality.  Parents who adopt the charade of Santa are doing it for their own selfish reasons instead of a desire to see their child grow up and trust and respect them.  Santa can be part of a fantastic myth -- but that myth should be explained clearly not long after a child is able to understand the difference between make-believe and reality.", "NTA- I found out those were all myths when I was 11. I agree with others here that it\u2019s best to find this out before middle school. By the time I was in 7th grade, everyone knew those things weren\u2019t real.", "NTA - It's always awkward to tell your kids you've been lying to them. It's just a weird part of the tradition. I found out when a teacher at school asked the class, \"does anyone here still believe in Santa?' That was a startling revelation.\n\nAnd while I'm at it, I think the whole Elf on the Shelf thing is freakin' creepy.", "NTA this bandaid needed to be ripped. No matter how he found out, it would been traumatizing.", "YTA. There is a sea of information out there on how to kindly break this news to kids, especially with a younger sibling in the picture. Instead, you made a snap decision to ignore your wife and punish his bad behavior by crushing his belief in magic\u2026on his birthday. \n\nYou seem eager to force your child to grow up at your pace and don\u2019t mind being careless with his feelings. It might seem dumb now because we\u2019re talking Santa and Elf dolls, but if you do this enough times at pivotal moments, you\u2019re cooking up a big batch of future resentment.", "Most kids know this at 7 or 8 years old...\n\nSo nta. Kid would probably be picked on if he still believes and shares that belief with his peers.", "If you hadn't already screwed it up, I would've said don't *tell* him they aren't real. He probably already knows, but enjoys the magic of them. Instead, invite his help to set up that magic for his younger sister... deciding where to place the elf, and hiding Easter eggs and that kind of thing. He'll get the message if he hasn't already, but in a fun way that allows him to keep playing with the concepts in a more adult way.\n\nSince you already messed up, I would still say give it time to the next holiday and then invite him into the setup end of the process. But do it tactfully, and don't take it personally if he doesn't want to. He may still be raw.\n\nYTA for doing it unnecessarily harshly, not for giving him accurate info.", "You are NTA. From experience (5th grade me arguing with a third grader that Santa is real), it will save Chris months of bullying. Through I found it to be lies by myself (and some convincing from the third grader), Chris still needs to grow up. (For me 11 is too old to still believe).", "NTA\n\n there have been a few young posters here asking if they were ass hole for blowing up at there parents for lying to them when they finally found out.", "YTA\n\nIt's the kid's birthday. Did you really have to choose that particular day to burst his bubble?\n\nSome kids take a little longer to figure it out, and even if you really thought it was time for him to move past these traditions - there are kinder ways to handle it.", "Why couldn't you tell him one was fake at a time? Like do it slowly. \n\nI have no memory myself of ever believing in Santa. I have a vivid memory of being in first grade and my friend, the same age, telling me his mom saw Santa flying in the sky. The mom glared at me not to say anything because I think she knew I didn't believe.\n\nSo I can't relate to that.\n\nBut I have taken a keen interest in cults (even wrote my college thesis on new religious movements), and from what I've gathered it takes a long time to process letting go of beliefs you thought you had when you leave a cult and you feel a great loss and conned. You start wondering what were you doing any of it for when it meant so much to you. It's a lot. And it hits you slowly. And thing after thing pops up: Was that real? Was that other thing real? It doesn't happen all at once.\n\nSo to lose all those creatures you mentioned all at once (the elves, santa, easter bunny, was there a tooth fairy?), that's a lot. \n\nI'd say YTA for information overload. Should have done it slowly with just one of these mythical creatures at a time. People coming out of cults need time to process, and sorry for the cult analogy, but I don't know about believing in Santa. My parents did do the tooth fairy thing, but I have no memory of ever believing it was anyone but them. I did wonder how they were able to put the money under the pillow without waking me up.", "NTA. It sounds like your wife wasn\u2019t ready yet, but it was time. Kids get mean in Middle School. Better he find out now and save him the embarrassment in class", "No matter the age, people's minds develop differently and at different paces. \n\nYou shouldn't be \"worried\" that your kid believes this stuff,  it's usually just a fantasy that kids don't want to let go of. \n\nHe would have come to you, probably when hitting high school, and told you that you were dumb to keep that tradition going. That would have been him saying that he doesn't believe it anymore, but he appreciates the fact you kept the ruse going for so long. \n\nGotta be honest mate, the fact you have an 11 year old that still believes it is a blessing! The amount of kids that know about things such a sex, let alone the tooth fairy isn't real, at ages like 7-9 is high, and you just dropped a bombshell on this kid that, in his eyes, was as heavy as an actual bomb. \n\nYou crushed his spirit for enjoying ANY of those holidays. \n\nYou're not an arsehole, just made a VERY poor judgement. It's obviously difficult to have those talks but always wait for him to come to YOU and ask why a kid in his class is saying Santa's isn't real. Now YOURE Krampus and he won't be able to trust you for a long time. \n\nFor the sense of the sub, YTA, but I think you need to take him out one on one and explain to him over ice cream or something, WHY you told him, and that it's still special to his sister and its a secret that you only trust him with. \n\n(I don't have kids so I'm going by what seems logical while dealing with young cousins in a similar situation, and hope that isn't manipulative info to give to a kid) \n\nIt will make him feel important and like an adult; which he will soon be (give it 2 years and you WISH he didn't know as much as he did) and he will not resent you for telling him as he will realise there are bigger things at play. \n\nEither way, now you have told him all of that (which was SO unwarranted, and you only did it to soothe your own insecurities) you now have to treat him like a teenager, in my opinion. \n\nGood luck OP; you fucked up majorly but I don't think you were an arsehole. Just a misguided man treating an 11 year old like a 16 year old. \n\nNow deal.\n\nEdit: I did not mean kids 7-9 shouldn't have sex education or know what sex is; I meant that a lot of children that age know about/watch porn/reference it, and also joke about wanking etc. Might just be the area of the UK I am in, but my main point is kids that age know WAY more than just sex education (which is important to learn obviously)", "It would be more understandable if the kid was around the age of almost becoming an adult, but you ruined the magic of holidays for a kid at such a young age\n\nSimply put, YTA", "Nta, gotta rip the bandaid off at some point, and he will appreciate you for the gifts like he should. 11 years seems like a fine age to do that", "YTA what's your rush to rip all the magic and fantasy away from the kid? Are you having a crap time and think everyone else should suffer too. Life just gets harder as you get older, what was wrong with letting the guy have a little magic for as long as possible. I get that you couldn't find the toy but there was a different way to handle this. \n\nOften times the magic in our childhoods is what gives us the strength to get though the sh!t we have to face as adults. Maybe you didn't have much magic as a kid, but I think it's a great shame that you're in such a rush to take his childhood away. I dont think it's the big favour that you think it is.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA. Because he didn\u2019t like your present you pulled him aside and shat on all of his holiday traditions in one fell swoop without introducing any new traditions on his birthday", "Probably a good idea for him to find out before middle school. NTA", "YTA, and you really messed up. At 11, Chris has undoubtedly been in many conversations with party-pooper classmates who insist Santa, etc., aren't real. Somewhere underneath his denial, he knows the truth. But he wasn't ready to give up the magic yet. You weren't prepping him for middle school; you were spoiling his fun.\n\nAnd you didn't even discuss it with your wife first.", "Yes yta.. you ruined the magical spirit", "Soft YTA\n\nYour timing was off and you should have talked it over more with your wife first. It would have been better to wait a couple of days after his birthday to have the conversation with your son.  The kid will have a mustache in a few years, so he is kind of late to the party on learning this- but maybe he already knows but is half-pretending to keep the magic alive. \n\nI personally would have just let it slide and not said a thing because he\u2019s bound to find out any minute anyway. However I think you could have tweaked a few of your actions and then told him the info to avoid the AH.", "NTA. My daughter was 4 years old when she figured it out. I hoped it would last a little longer, but it didn\u2019t. You don\u2019t want your son to be teased at school especially at middle school!!! He needs to know.", "YTA for telling your son that Santa and company are real in the first place. There's really no need to do that at all. \n\nBut if you'd like to argue that kids should believe in Santa, then YTA for not telling him the truth when he was much younger.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Geez.\n\nI get that you don't want him to be bullied. But here's the thing about bullies: they target kids who aren't sure of themselves. If your son were sure of himself, he might get teased a bit about believing in Santa, but he wouldn't get bullied. Now, do you think the way you told him, with your underlying belief that something is seriously wrong with him for still believing at that age, is going to help him feel confident about himself? No? Then you just made him a bully target. \n\nKids believe until they're ready to let go. If they ask is Santa real, and they're old enough to know the truth, ask them seriously if they want the truth. If they say yes, tell them that the spirit of Santa is real, but that parents (and kids who know the secret) do the work. If they aren't ready to know, they'll say they already know the truth, and drop the subject. So do that with your daughter.\n\nAfter my little brother figured out about Santa, Mom said to us all, \"Since you all know about Santa, I guess we're done with him, then.\" We all looked at her like she was nuts! And we continued to have Santa until we all moved out of the house. One year, my brother and I went in on a nice gift for our parents, and said it was from Santa!

Tbh your 9 year old is also too old to still be believing in Santa etc. Also their schools must be really lacking in non-Christian students. I had that spoiled for me when I was like, 6-7. \n\nSituations like this make me more firm in my belief that I won\u2019t be telling my future children that any of these things are true.

I have 2 small kids and they believe in Santa, but they also understand that not all their presents come from Santa. You see, I was the kid that Santa got one toy for and it was something cheap. When I would go to school, I would hear all the other kids talk about all the cool new expensive toys Santa brought them. I was very upset and wondered why Santa did not like me enough to bring me all these cool toys or even more than one present. My parents pushed Santa hard on us, so as you can imagine only get one present at Christmas total made my child self feel unloved. I want my children to have the magic of Christmas but I also want them to understand that not everyone has the same life as they do, so Santa only brings them 2 toys(one they really really wanted and one that is educational) every other present comes from their parents(my husband and I), their Aunt, or their grandparents. The way I see it is, let them have the magic while the are young, but also help them understand that there are others less fortunate than us who only get one present", "I second this.

When they remember him really well and have a ton of anticipation! Most kids I feel like do figure it out by about age 10. Which is a good age to me.

Toy manufacturers control the kindergarten rackets, so that's never going to make it onto the ground unfortunately.", "My husband's kindergarten teacher told the class that Santa wasn't real the day before Christmas break.

That could ruin a kid's academic future!\n\nIf you didn't tell him, someone at school would, and then they would all laugh their heads off at the boy who still believes in Santa...and he would travel home with some choice words for the folks who have been lying to him all this time. Reality check.", "Here's the thing though, everyone develops differently. if you just take something a kid believes in (especially something that makes them happy) and just straight up tell them it doesn't exist or matter, you're going to crush them. it'll just suck all that joy straight out of them.
