Even if that were true why are sister's needs more important than yours? You sister will be in school that day. How will your move prevent her from being in school? Worse comes to worse.

They can\u2019t change the day of your sister\u2019s first day of school, and they probably want to be there before and after her school?

The first day of school is definitely a big deal, but so is moving off to college? There are so many ways to make this work, have your parents come after dropping sister off at school, have only one of them take the sister and the other comes with you, take one car load of stuff and come back on the weekend for the rest, help the sister arrange school transportation aside from your parents (depending how she feels about it).

No one I ever knew had parents that made a fuss except for 1st grade. Weird.", "And they have plans that day. OP made their arrangements months ago, dad made his arrangements and neither parent noticed a conflict until now. That\u2019s on them to be organized. OP is NTA.
