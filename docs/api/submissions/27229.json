It certainly wasn't the easiest time in my life, balancing going to college (and eventually job hunting) with a baby. There would have been no way I could have done it truly alone and I recognize just how lucky I was to have such great friends and family there to help me out. There would have been no way I would've been able to finish college, let alone keep a roof over our heads without them. My sister (34F) is included in that. She helped watch my son on nights I had coursework to complete. \n\nTo make a long story short, or to condense a few very pivotal years of my life down into one paragraph: My husband was a grad student TA for a university class I was taking. I originally moved in with him as friends, finally able to get out of my parents place and pay half of an apartment rent bill on my own. We fell into co-parenting very easily even though it likely would've been complicated with anyone else. Now we're married, our son has a little brother, and we own a home.\n\nThis takes us to our conflict. My sister recently told us that she's divorcing her husband (34M). This is the father of her three children and someone I've known since I was about 15. To my knowledge, he's a good man and a great father. This came as a shock to our entire family. Still, I was being supportive and keeping my thoughts to myself because maybe there were parts of the relationship we didn't know about. That was until I found out that my sister had simply met someone new. \n\nI think my past experiences play a huge role in how I see fatherhood and relationships in general. Watching my oldest take to my husband so easily, getting to my husband love not just me but little human who is an extension of me as well... it's an indescribable feeling. I felt similarly when we went through the surrogacy process and had baby number 2 as well. There's a very specific love and adoration I feel for him when I look at him with our children that's hard to put into words. I just don't know how you give that up for someone else.\n\nMy sister asked me to watch her children last weekend so she could go on a date night with this new guy. She and her husband are separated so I wouldn't consider it cheating, but I still felt uncomfortable with the whole thing. I basically told her that I would do anything in the world for her, including watch her children, in any situation other than this one. I said I thought she was crazy for throwing away what she had for this new guy and felt uncomfortable being complicit in it. She said I was a dick for being unsupportive, and that she had done things for other people for years and this was the first thing she had done for herself in years. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695149432, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mz1mv/aita_for_calling_my_sister_crazy_and_not/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she's not in love with him and no longer feels the relationship is working, why is that crazy?", "YTA.  You have no idea what is going on with your sister's relationship with her soon to be ex.  You aren't privy to the day to day things which led up to this and stop projecting.  Be there for your sister.  She is separated and you are complicit in nothing.", "YTA. It\u2019s her choice, not yours, and you really have no idea what the relationship is like behind closed doors. You are passing judgement on her when she didn\u2019t judge you for having a baby when you clearly couldn\u2019t shoulder the responsibility on your own.", "YTA.  Even had your sister not been one of the many incredible support people during a very difficult time in your life, I think you being so judgmental and refusing to simply babysit your own nieces and nephews so she can go to dinner because you\u2019re on some high horse is ridiculous. If her marriage had been perfect, simply meeting someone new wouldn\u2019t have ended it. No one else is ever privy to what goes on in someone else\u2019s relationship.   Also you\u2019re acting a little high and  mighty and sanctimonious about \u2018how can she not view the kids dad the same way you view your partner as your spouse and coparent\u2019. Has she said he\u2019s a terrible father? Has she said she never wants the kids to be with him? She may likely still view him as an excellent father, but for whatever reason she has decided he is not her life partner anymore.  You\u2019re completely judging her because she does not currently feel the exact same way about her partner as you currently do about yours.", "YTA. Not because she babysat first or whatever, but because you\u2019re going to withhold something based on the fact that you don\u2019t believe your sister should be doing something that makes her happy. You full on admit you don\u2019t know everything about their marriage, just that he seems like a good guy and a good dad. You can be a good dad and not be the love of someone\u2019s life, and you shouldn\u2019t stay with someone just because they\u2019re a good parent if they\u2019re not your soulmate. Good parents stay good parents even if you get a divorce.\n\nYou love your husband and that\u2019s great. She didn\u2019t love hers, and she\u2019s doing the things for her that may lead her to the same place you found. That\u2019s also great. \n\nAs long as she\u2019s not keeping the kids from their dad, and as long as this guy isn\u2019t literally satan, it\u2019s honestly none of your business why she isn\u2019t happy with her marriage.", "YTA \n\nSit down. This isn't your relationship.", "YTA. You're projecting your own feelings onto a situation that has nothing to do with you.\n\nYou don't know what the relationship was like behind closed doors. It could have been loving and eventually they just grew away from each other, or it could have been incredibly toxic and controlling and they eventually realised they're no good for each other. Anything is possible.\n\nPoint is, your sisters choice doesn't need your judgemental attitude.", "YTA. This is super controlling of you. And also weird. As you said, you don't know what was going on in your sister's relationship, but her not wanting to be in it anymore is her own business. And it's super weird that you're just full on leaning into and even acknowledging your own biases, but not figuring out how to approach it without them. If you don't wanna babysit for your sister, then fine, but if the reason you're doing it is because you don't like what she's doing with her time then, yeah, that's an AH move.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nYour sister didn't judge you when you needed her help, repeatedly. And you can't babysit for one night?", "YTA. The only two people who know what's really going on in a marriage are those two people. AND! you benefited from years of support, seemingly judgment free even though you were a single mum with challenges etc. Now she needs some support. Who knows? maybe a date or two will give her food for thought about what she really wants? Not your business. Her journey. Get off your high horse and show her some love.", "YTA.  You said it yourself, you don't know what went on in your sister's relationship.  If people are unhappy in a marriage then they can leave - even when they are both perfectly nice people and there are kids involved.   Sometimes a relationship has been dead for years and it just takes some sort of catalyst for the final break.  In any case, your sister asked you to watch her kids for one night, she did not ask your opinion on her separation.  And I don't see where doting, loving fatherhood comes into the equation.  Divorced dads are still fathers.", "\"This is the father of her three children and someone I've known since I was about 15. To my knowledge, he's a good man and a great father.\"  -- He can be the greatest guy in the world, that does not mean that your friendship with him has to end, it does not mean either that they are compatible as a couple..\n\n\"She and her husband are separated so I wouldn't consider it cheating, but I still felt uncomfortable with the whole thing.\" -- You are being judgmental of your sister.

And a raging hypocrite. You have no idea what went on in their relationship. For all you know, he could have been abusive, cheating on her, or simply wants to follow a different path than her. She did you a solid and watched your kid so you could get your degree. And now you sit in moral judgement of her. Hope you don't fall off your pedestal, cause she won't be their to save your ass again.", "YTA. You're right. There are probably things you don't know about your sister's marriage. Therefore, you need to keep your opinions to yourself and refrain from moralizing. Your sister helped you when you were struggling, and you're the asshole for refusing to help her out in whatever way you can.  I'm glad you have such profound feelings for your husband, but other people are not you, and you have no right to expect them to be you.", "Sorry but I think YTA. Sometime relationships don't last. Ash you know, you really don't know what goes on in someone's marriage. She is separated and simply moving on with her life. You don't *have* to babysit, but I think your reasoning is BS and you're being judgemental. Support your sister like she has done for you.", "YTA - whatever the reasons, her relationship with her (ex)husband is over. You making childcare harder for her is not going to solve that. You were being unsupportive. How would you feel if she refused to watch your child because she has objections to you choosing to study X at school? It's absurd and penalizing her choices that aren't directed towards you. Apologize and make it up to her.", "YTA- you have no idea why they are breaking apart and divorcing. So stop forcing your views of them staying together on your sister. She isnt throwing anything away, if she was happy with her husband she'd not have been attracted to someone else.", "A soft YTA here. Your sister did a lot for you in the past, and you admitted it wasn't an issue to babysit for the night. You let your own opinions of the situation get in the way of supporting family. \n\nYou already mentioned that you don't know the full story of why they are separating - sometimes even a relationship that is perfect on the outside can be rocky for those in it. I'd apologize to your sister and offer to take the kids off her hands for a make up date.", "YTA. You don\u2019t know what goes on behind closed doors. You are being very judgmental towards someone who didn\u2019t judge you for the circumstances leading up to you being a single mother", "YTA\n\nWhether to stay with her husband is her call, and there could potentially be a lot of important info that you just aren't aware of.  You may think he's a good man, but that's just what you are seeing.  He could be cheating, abusive, etc. and you just aren't aware of it.  Or maybe they've just grown apart but it's not your call to tell her that she should or shouldn't stay with him, and when you needed her help, she didn't try to force her positions on to you.", "YTA.....you have no idea what goes on behind close doors", "YTA - you do not know the ins and out of her marriage. You are punishing her for moving on because YOU think her marriage was fine.  And honestly, who cares about YOUR experiences when it comes to HER marriage.  Be a brother who supports his sister.  Be there for her like she was for you.", "YTA \n\nShe said she finally was doing something for herself.  That sentence shows that her marriage was falling apart from neglect.", "YTA You think you're better than her because you are in a relationship right now?\n\nJudging your sister when you know nothing about her marriage. She supported you when you needed it and probably didn't say anything about you being a single mom. now she wants an evening out and it's going against you \"morals\"\n\nGet over yourself.", "Yta.", "Apologize to your sister. You are putting your emotional expectations on her. She is not living your life. You have no idea what she's been through. You do know, though, that now she is a single parent. You also know that you owe her for her years of helping you with your child. Reciprocity is a powerful motivator. Get motivated. At the very least, her kids could use your love and support at this time. This has to be difficult for THEM. YTA.", "So she didn't judge you for being a trashy sl*t and having a child out of wedlock, but you're judging her for ending one relationship and beginning another? \n\nSounds like you're trashy, judgemental, entitled and YTA.", "YTA.  \n\n\nRelationships don't have to end just because someone did something wrong. Sometimes people are just not right for each other. Your sister isn't doing anything wrong. She didn't cheat on her husband or treat him badly. She made an adult choice which she is allowed to do. Does it suck that your friend/her ex gets hurt. Of course it does.  \n\n\nBut it isn't your place to sit in judgement of your sister.  \n\n\nShe did for you when you needed it. So it\\['s time for you to do for her.", "YTA\n\nYour anger at your sister is what\u2019s motivating you to feel this way.

There could be a million reasons she left but surely she deserves to be happy", "YTA. You are judgemental and controlling. You also have no respect for your sister and don't trust her to do what's best for her. If your family acted the same way when you needed them, where would you be?\n\n It's not like she's asking you to cover up her affair, ffs!", "YTA because you\u2019re making your return of her favours contingent on whether or not you approve of a situation that a) has nothing to do with you b) isn\u2019t causing you harm and is consensual and c) is just a date night. I\u2019d be so disappointed if my sister was as judgmental as you in this situation.", "YTA.  Oh please...you would do anything for her...but the one thing she actually asked you to do.  Keep out of her divorce.", "YTA , like you said, you don\u2019t know what happens behind closed doors. You can have your opinions but you are trying to impose them on her. She could have ignored you for being a single mother too, getting pregnant instead of focusing on studies\u2026 every choice of ours, may be a bad choice in someone elses opinion, that doesn\u2019t mean they are right, we are wrong. Diff choices work for diff ppl. Help out and be there for your sister", "YTA. She helped you, and now you're refusing to help her because you're making moral judgments? You have no idea what her marriage was. She is separated, and getting divorced. Those were her decisions to make, not yours. Get over yourself.", "I coukd understand if your sister was asking you to watch the kids while she had an affair.\n\nBut shes been upfront and split with her husband. I assume she didnt chest before breaking things off?\n\nYou're right you dont know her relationship. I was with my ex for 8 years. My sister became very close with him too. But there were things she didnt know. I fell out of love with him and left him. She found it hard. But i didnt feel it was her business to know all the ressons i no longer saw my ex in the same light. He didnt do anything massive like cheat. It was his way of life and being that just wore me down over time.\n\nYour sister may have been the same. Fallen out of love over a thousand small things. And as a human being, as sad as that is when it happens, she is allowed to do that. We have no idea whether she tried to fix the marriage before finally moving on. But shes obviously found someone who, even if it doesnt work out, is making her feel good right now. Do you really think she would have broken her fanily up for no reason? I know some folks do it on a daft smitten whim. But you know your sister - would she?\n\nYou should have offered support. You can still have your feelings and expressed those. But youve openly said she has done so much for you. All she wanted was a few hours.", "YTA you don't know their relationship you say so yourself but you still think she's throwing something away?

Why is it ok for you to not be with your kids' baby momma but it's not ok for your sister to divorce?
