You might want to keep your distance from your sister for a while and just focus on a healthy pregnancy. She doesn\u2019t sound supportive anyway.

I hope you have a community in your life, homeschooling or neighbours, that\u2019ll support you. I found mine and it\u2019s been amazing. Chosen family can be more supportive.

I wish you sooo much luck in your pregnancy journey and the transition to having 2 babies.", "NTA. If the word you omitted is the word I think it is, she's lucky you only called her a bitch. I'd have seen red if she'd used that word about my kids. That's an NC boundary imo.", "NTA\n\nShe completely deserved it.

That\u2019s unforgivable in my book.", "Tell your mother you'll apologize for calling her a bitch the minute she publicly tells the entire family the things she said about your son, your future child, and you. Frankly, your family sounds like a toxic mess. Why your mother singled you out is baffling, to say the least, unless there is more to this story than meets the eye. Yes, you lost your cool, and shouldn't have called her a bitch, just as she shouldn't have said the horrible shit she said to you.

Did your mom also require your sister apologies for the names she called your children?", "NTA. It\u2019s extremely rude for your sister to even be expressing an opinion about your child\u2019s education. It\u2019s 100% not her business.

And to call your son a name so bad you can't even type it -- how dare she!

All that matters is that your son learns what he needs to know in a way that works for him. If homeschooling does that, great! Might wanna stay away from your sister for a while.", "NTA. Your kid your choice how to raise him. Sister can blow smoke. No apology needed. But she owes you one.", "Hmmm, maybe you shouldn't have called her a bitch.  But it sounds like she is one so yeah NTA, your parenting decisions are yours and your partners alone and she doesn't get a say.\n\nDon't understand why your sister is so against home schooling though, thousand of kids get home schooled and get well educated.  The only thing I would advise is to make sure is that your son does do activities that allow him to socialize with other kids his age.", "NTA this is your life let her own kids go to school. She cannot dictate your life and how it\u2019s run. She seems like she wants to be in control. You\u2019re a terrible mother or sister.

It\u2019s not as bad as doing something terrible. But two wrongs, however they\u2019re balanced, don\u2019t make a right. \n\nI think that you were wrong to invoke that word. I don\u2019t think you were wrong in any other way. I think you may owe your mother and sister an apology for your word choice. If you apologize, I would keep it really, really narrow. Because your sister is definitely a terrible, disrespectful, judgmental, bigoted and mean-spirited person, and doesn\u2019t deserve an apology for being called out on it. \n\nI\u2019ll give you a pass this time because I\u2019m loathe to give you the same judgement as your sister. Go forth and sin no more. NTA.", "Your sister is over stepping her bounds, and has done so many times.

I don't fault you for a second for getting defensive and your momma bear coming out and protecting your children after what she said.

Your mother needs to stay out of it. Was she not appalled at what your sister said about your children? If not, then she's just as much the problem!", "NTA.   \nYour sister is unhinged.   \nI've worked in disabled care.   \nI've homeschooled.  \nEven in districts with excellent reputations horrific abuses can occur.   \n\nHow would a could feel being sent off to school,  away from Mom and out of the house as soon as a sibling is born?", "I won't give any judgment since I really don't know the way of homeschooling since I am not from America ...but aren't there downsides from homeschooling? Like from googling real quick people can just create a diploma and act like their kid knows everything you would need to learn even tho they didn't teach their kid much of the curriculum? Are tests normal? Do you get them from a state Educational Department or do you make stuff up? \n\nOkay sorry anyway... back to the main topic of the post.\n\nDo you think you could manage a new born and to teach your son at the same time without it impacting him in a bad way? If so then I see no problem, if both children are treated right and it is legally allowed and you do a good job being mother and teacher. Maybe invite your sister to silently see your education first hand, or make a video (like a blog) of things you do with your son. \n\nYour sister **seems** worried and thinks that the public/private schools are better than to be home schooled and if she really cares about her nephew that much (tries to give him a school life) maybe you could at least try to educate HER about what goes into it. If that doesn't help maybe try to go low contact with her until she stops butting into your life as much.", "[removed]", "Wow. Sadly, this would have been the end of our relationship. You keep putting those babies first and go low contact with the hateful witch you got stuck with for a sister.", "NTA schooling an ASD kid is so difficult. You have to juggle so many factors and for all it can compound social difficulties, sometimes homeschooling lightens the other aspects so much that its the only choice.", "I feel sorry for your children.

People who are against homeschooling have no idea what homeschooling is. We homeschool.  My parents were against it. I think they thought we just teach the kids stuff thst we know and there's no structure? I had to explain we bought the curriculum and how it works. One of my sisters even came over to sit through a lesson to see what we do. My kids are thriving academically and are way ahead of their peers. Its because of the one on one attention, tailoring classes to the children specifically and being able to create a fun learning environment. Your sister (her calling your son that is unforgivable) comes across in this post as evil. If shes not always evil maybe invite her to sit in a lesson. If she's always like this I'd just cut contact. \nAlso it's absolutely possible to teach while having a baby. The beauty of homeschool!", "Don't apologise, I think your comment was justified.
