I had a large gap between the second child and the third child so I had some children in junior high years and some in preschool type years. The two youngest were reading at second grade level at the age of three. This was not with an overburdened hours long study. It took 15 minutes per day of sitting on dad\u2018s lap and going over some fun illustrated instructions. Three of my children work in a very successful company we/they started from the ground up in 2006; it grosses over $22 million per year. My oldest is coming up on the age of 40 and has a masters degree in music theory, currently working on his doctoral thesis. Their social life was so busy. I could\u2019ve found something for them to do every single day of the week if I chose. They were never isolated and I do not have a teaching degree. How could this happen? I\u2019ll tell you what, it can, and does. My children got individual attention, and when I did not know how to teach a subject, either my husband would teach it or I would farm out those things to private classes. Three of my children graduated from high school a year earlier than ordinary children. You can do it. Do not listen to your critics. If you feel bad about calling your sister a name, you can certainly apologize on that basis, but you can still set boundaries. If you wish to make those subjects off topic, read her this comment or the comments of other people who have homeschooled and done well with it. One other aside, one of the biggest criticisms of homeschooling is that people think the children of homeschoolers will turn out to be socially stunted. My children knew how to converse with adults from the age of two. It\u2019s simply a matter of intentional parenting. You will be fine, don\u2019t let anybody bully  or shame you into, thinking you are\u201dless than\u201d for choosing the best for your children.", "NTA. Scientific research shows a few things. \n\nFirst, in general homeschooled children do better on standardised testing. \n\nSecond there is little evidence of social difficulties as long as you increase social activities as well. \n\nThird, finding good schooling for kids on the spectrum is hard. \n\nFourth, every mean, stupid jerk I've ever met went to a conventional  school. Every bully I've met went to a conventional school, even just anecdotally anyone who went to conventional school knows they often suck. Hard. \n\nAll that being said, thats not what this is about. This is about your sister trying to raise your kids and im gonna assume dropping an awful hurtful slur. I mean she went to conventional school, and she's horrible to her sister and nephew.  It can't be that brilliant can it, if it turns out people like her. \n\nIgnore all the idiots who haven't researched shit and think anyone not doing something \"normal\" is bad.

I\u2019m leaning NTA, assuming you have some credentials.", "hey there howdy. \n   I was homeschooled most of my childhood. this decision was mainly due to the fact that I had two disabled siblings and it was easier to just homeschool us all instead of wrangling schools for accommodations.\n   so, this is just to say: I get it. parenting is tough and you're making the best decisions you can. \n   that being said... please consider checking out \nr/homeschoolrecovery . much love and luck to you.\n\nalso nta :)", "People say home schooled kids are weird but have you ever been to a public school?? That shit is weird and tbh detrimental to a lot of kids", "NTA \n\nWhile personally I wouldn't homeschool kids, I definitely understand some of the reasoning behind doing so, especially if conditions such as ASD is involved. Really the main thing is that the child should have access to education and have opportunities to interact with others socially to develop those skills they will need later in life.\n\nI've interacted with both the very good and very bad side of homeschooling while in Girl Scouts. On the good side, the mother was actively involved and made sure her kids were active in the community, not just in Girl Scouts but elsewhere too to get a variety. Also the girl was at least a full grade above her age/us so she definitely wasn't lacking in education either. She did do her last year in high school at a public school so she could get a proper diploma. She's turned out more than fine. \n\nThe other one though was... Yikes. Her mother didn't do anything so the girl couldn't read above kindergarten level despite being 4th grade age. Had very low social skills and they were very spoiled at home. Those kids had free reign of the house and the girl I knew dropped out of Scouts after a year so I have no clue what happened to her or her siblings. I can't imagine there was much improvement. \n\nSo homeschooling can be perfectly valid as long as the parent takes the responsibility to actually be proactive in their child's social and educational needs. It's very easy for parents to not take that responsibility, but doesn't mean they all will. This kind of thing is not often understood by those who aren't homeschooled because most only see the bad examples. So I get the sister's concerns.

I refused to go to school on a regular basis, crying and screaming most mornings, probably because I was so burnt out every single day there.

I felt guilty and shamed, and was mad at myself.\n\nOn the days I did stay home, I played with toys, made drawings and crafts, watched cartoons but also sometimes documentaries, read many books\u2026 and I caught right back up with my schooling peers even after a month of being out of school in around grade 4.
