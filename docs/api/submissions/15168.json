I had a large gap between the second child and the third child so I had some children in junior high years and some in preschool type years. The two youngest were reading at second grade level at the age of three. This was not with an overburdened hours long study. It took 15 minutes per day of sitting on dad\u2018s lap and going over some fun illustrated instructions. Three of my children work in a very successful company we/they started from the ground up in 2006; it grosses over $22 million per year. My oldest is coming up on the age of 40 and has a masters degree in music theory, currently working on his doctoral thesis. Their social life was so busy. I could\u2019ve found something for them to do every single day of the week if I chose. They were never isolated and I do not have a teaching degree. How could this happen? I\u2019ll tell you what, it can, and does. My children got individual attention, and when I did not know how to teach a subject, either my husband would teach it or I would farm out those things to private classes. Three of my children graduated from high school a year earlier than ordinary children. You can do it. Do not listen to your critics. If you feel bad about calling your sister a name, you can certainly apologize on that basis, but you can still set boundaries. If you wish to make those subjects off topic, read her this comment or the comments of other people who have homeschooled and done well with it. One other aside, one of the biggest criticisms of homeschooling is that people think the children of homeschoolers will turn out to be socially stunted. My children knew how to converse with adults from the age of two. It\u2019s simply a matter of intentional parenting. You will be fine, don\u2019t let anybody bully  or shame you into, thinking you are\u201dless than\u201d for choosing the best for your children.", "NTA. Scientific research shows a few things. \n\nFirst, in general homeschooled children do better on standardised testing. \n\nSecond there is little evidence of social difficulties as long as you increase social activities as well. \n\nThird, finding good schooling for kids on the spectrum is hard. \n\nFourth, every mean, stupid jerk I've ever met went to a conventional  school. Every bully I've met went to a conventional school, even just anecdotally anyone who went to conventional school knows they often suck. Hard. \n\nAll that being said, thats not what this is about. This is about your sister trying to raise your kids and im gonna assume dropping an awful hurtful slur. I mean she went to conventional school, and she's horrible to her sister and nephew.  It can't be that brilliant can it, if it turns out people like her. \n\nIgnore all the idiots who haven't researched shit and think anyone not doing something \"normal\" is bad.

I\u2019m leaning NTA, assuming you have some credentials.", "hey there howdy. \n   I was homeschooled most of my childhood. this decision was mainly due to the fact that I had two disabled siblings and it was easier to just homeschool us all instead of wrangling schools for accommodations.\n   so, this is just to say: I get it. parenting is tough and you're making the best decisions you can. \n   that being said... please consider checking out \nr/homeschoolrecovery . much love and luck to you.\n\nalso nta :)", "People say home schooled kids are weird but have you ever been to a public school?? That shit is weird and tbh detrimental to a lot of kids", "NTA \n\nWhile personally I wouldn't homeschool kids, I definitely understand some of the reasoning behind doing so, especially if conditions such as ASD is involved. Really the main thing is that the child should have access to education and have opportunities to interact with others socially to develop those skills they will need later in life.\n\nI've interacted with both the very good and very bad side of homeschooling while in Girl Scouts. On the good side, the mother was actively involved and made sure her kids were active in the community, not just in Girl Scouts but elsewhere too to get a variety. Also the girl was at least a full grade above her age/us so she definitely wasn't lacking in education either. She did do her last year in high school at a public school so she could get a proper diploma. She's turned out more than fine. \n\nThe other one though was... Yikes. Her mother didn't do anything so the girl couldn't read above kindergarten level despite being 4th grade age. Had very low social skills and they were very spoiled at home. Those kids had free reign of the house and the girl I knew dropped out of Scouts after a year so I have no clue what happened to her or her siblings. I can't imagine there was much improvement. \n\nSo homeschooling can be perfectly valid as long as the parent takes the responsibility to actually be proactive in their child's social and educational needs. It's very easy for parents to not take that responsibility, but doesn't mean they all will. This kind of thing is not often understood by those who aren't homeschooled because most only see the bad examples. So I get the sister's concerns.

I felt guilty and ashamed, and was mad at myself.\n\nOn the days I did stay home, I played with toys, made drawings and crafts, watched cartoons but also sometimes documentaries, read many books\u2026 and I caught right back up with my schooling peers even after a month of being out of school in around grade 4. It\u2019s not like kids learn much at school (in terms of math, English, etc.) at that age. Sure, maybe the days of staying at home kept me from developing social skills, but I can assure you it wouldn\u2019t have gone any better even if I was at school every single day (which would\u2019ve definitely driven me crazy!)\n\nIf homeschooling was an option for me and my parents, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve learnt a lot more both academically and otherwise.

I\u2019m in university now, and despite having gone to school (on most days) as a child, I still struggle with socializing with peers and in other areas. I\u2019m also struggling more with academics than before, probably because of the harder and more specialized material AND because I was never taught learning and coping strategies that suited my needs which structured homeschooling might have. I\u2019m doing okay honestly probably thanks to somewhat understanding parents that stopped forcing me to go to school every single day\u2026 LOL\u2026 and I still occasionally get nightmares from how I was treated by certain teachers in elementary and middle school.", "NTA\n\nYour sister called your child a slur and revealed her true self in doing so.

We have to keep actual records, examples of work, have plans - all the same stuff as teachers and we have to keep it for some many years.  DSS supervises everything - literally.  \n\nIn my area/state we have homeschooling groups that kids can meet up with and participate in different activities together, so they get the interactions with other kids.  There are dances, etc.  Also, local places such as the Y have a homeschooling gym class all kids can participate in. Local Zoos and Parks have teaching resources and host classes for home school kids.    There is a lot of enrichment and kids are able to have friends and interact within their community just like school kids.\n\nAlso, a lot of homeschool kids these days like mine - did online classes where it could be tracked, grades and then shown to DSS that class was in fact being taught as directed.  Our state regulates what classes and material must be taught along with anything extra the parents want to teach.\n\nThe problem is when DSS or whatever state agency that governs HS - does not do its job and it does not check on the kids and the kids are being abused - but that happens in public school as much as it does HS.  We have had several kids die while going to school because no one took allegations seriously or never even reported it.  We actually had one case where the parents were public school teachers - and because they were teachers and the child attended public school it took years for anyone to report it to DSS or for DSS to investigate. \n\nThere are negatives to public schooling, private school and homeschooling.

I did the whole request per federal laws for his disabilities - documented - he was seen weekly for treatment but because the school veto'd  a doctor's prescription/advice and he became w/drawn and just shut down - I finally pulled him and got him back up to speed - literally using the advice of his psychiatrist, psychologist and advice from the teacher they had thru that group and he improved greatly.  He rejoined in middle school and did just fine the rest of the time.  We tried private school, but it is not regulated as tightly as public or homeschooling.  He had a teacher who threatened him, me and several other peeps - the actual school was trying to fire him but had to jump thru hoops that they should not have had to jump thru, but I finally felt it was too unsafe for my son.  In our state you can be a teacher at a private school even if you could never be a teacher in a public school - only 50% have to have a teaching license in comparison to public and they don't have to have the background checks with private that they have with public.\n\nPublic schools' kids can be passed forward - even when failing because the school just gives all kids barely passing grades even if they do no work - a participate in class grade (which I have never understood).

This was before SeaWorld is bad was known, so my apologies - but when she was teaching him about the food web (I think it was, this was A While Ago), she took him to the nearby SeaWorld and zoo. When they were learning about medieval England she took him to a Ren fair to show him \"what it's portrayed as vs what it's actually like\". \n\nFrom what I remember, he had pretty severe ADHD and had diabetes as well as some other health issues I'm not sure about, both of which was why he was home schooled.

However, a parent doesn't have to provide more samples  (which is different from the initial sample the district does ask for) without a specific reason. But like I said, I live in one of the 2 states that have these  stricter requirements and regulations. I believe homeschooling should be regulated to ensure kids are actually actively participating in whatever education plan has been set. \n\nI've also heard from parents and seen actual evidence of some poor kiddos who struggled so much in the school system. Those are usually students with IEPs and either aren't getting enough attention, the school isn't following the IEP or whatever program, and even students who have been verbally abused and aggressively handled. When their parents started homeschooling, the student did so much better. It really depends on the household.\n\nSince covid lockdowns, in my district, it's something near thirty percent of students who are still absent from school. Nearly 3 years after lockdown ended. Our particular district, specifically the administration and not the teachers, struggle with the students they are in charge of.

Im a homeschooled autistic teen and I can reassure you being homeschooled was the best thing we could have ever done for my mental health, sensory needs, and my education. She\u2019s horrible for making that comment, im sorry you had to hear that.", "Does your kid have opportunities to make friends his own age? You\u2019re definitely not stunting him socially?", "My husband was homeschooled and he's one of the smartest people I've ever met. That was one of the things that attracted me to him was his intelligence. \n\nNTA she deserves it and you deserve better support!", "NTA. Your sister is truly lucky that all you did was use your words as a response to her thoughts on your second baby.  you are doing what works for you and your family she can kindly butt out. set your boundaries and keep them. I recently heard another reddit story where a husband and wife would \"put mom in a time out\" when she was disrespectful to the son or DIL. This is something you could do, when your sister ignores your boundaries simply do not see her for a set amount of time. you do not need to tell her that she is in a time out, but when she wants to get together just say that you are unavailable. \n\nif anyone needs to apologize it is your sister, and whoever lets her go on and on about how your choices for you family are wrong.", "Holy hell, your sister is pissing me off. NTA, she deserved it.", "Indeed. How on earth could you possibly socialize a child without setting her loose on a playground full of feral, undisciplined little assholes? Having another kid shove his hands down your pants, being told off for hitting him in response, being forced to stand in front of the class to explain *why* his actions made you uncomfortable, and then listening to his five minutes of excuses, self-pity, and anger over your retaliation is one of the foundational experiences of childhood!\n\nPublic school socialization can work if it\u2019s done properly, but a depressing number of schools fail to foster an environment that enables *healthy* socialization. I\u2019m not going to shame a parent who opts out of subjecting their child to half baked zero tolerance/restorative justice/PBIS/whatever fad is currently in to absolve school administrators of responsibility. As long as a homeschooling parent enables healthy socialization through other activities, the kid is probably going to be fine. Or even better off, depending on how terrible the previous situation was. \n\nYou can download Kodable or whatever other program for a homeschooled kid, which may the exact same thing that many public school students are using. (You wouldn\u2019t believe the amount of instruction that is now done via online programs in public schools nowadays.) You can\u2019t un-traumatize a child who has been actively taught by a dysfunctional school system that they need to quietly accept abuse from whatever kid is the biggest and loudest bully.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Very religious, the whole nine yards. But, they were extremely accepting and tolerant. They were involved with a group of homeschoolers, and did so much with the community and their church. Probably had more of a social life than I did in the public school system.\n\nEveryone is different, and I'm not at all trying to make your situation obsolete, just putting in different situation. It's possible to homeschool the \"right\" way. The parents just have to be in it 100% for the kids.", "Also homeschooled until high school and I fucking hate homeschooling and think it should be criminalized unless the parents legitimately have an education degree and are legally required to not teach that Jesus ran with the dinosaurs.", "I have several friends who decide to homeschool and they\u2019ve all just kind of gone off the deep end. Their kids have become very anti-social even though they attend Co-Ops and the focus has become on political agenda against schools and a lot of religion.", "I don't homeschool, but I get the temptation., I think it is really different now from what it used to be, at least where I am. It seems like there are a ton of programs and resources for families, and a strong community of homeschoolers so there isn't much isolation. Definitely something you want to do right, but honestly, the public schools in my city are such a mess, I think about homeschooling a lot.", "My son is autistic and intellectually disabled.  Public school has been a godsend for him.  We have been lucky to have amazing teachers and resources for him that homeschooling wouldn't have provided.  I don't know how to teach him mathematics and reading the way a special education teacher does because he doesn't learn the way most kids do.", "I've been working in special education for 20 years and I have never seen ABA in a school setting.
