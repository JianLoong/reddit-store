But it ended and I learned that she had gotten pregnant with our daughter. She was not willing to co-parent and so to see my daughter we needed to have it out in court. I won equal custody but within a year of that she was hardly ever around. Then she became pregnant and her son was born with no father in the picture. She was not stable and did not give a crap about him at all. It got to the point where she was willing to drop him off with someone else, anyone else, and just leave him. I told her I would raise him. But she decided I should pay to get him. This became another court battle and ultimately, she was too unstable with him to keep him so he became my son. I adopted him very soon after.\n\nI raised my kids together, alone, and I've done my best to give them a good life. They didn't see or hear from their mom for years. Now both are in their teens and she's back, with two more children. She expected me to take in her other two kids but I said no. I told her I was not going to start raising and being responsible for all the children she had. She didn't ask about my kids at all. She was just focused on the younger two. She doesn't even want the same arrangement with them. She wants to raise them but for me to act as a father and pay for them like they're mine.\n\nNow she has started to show up with her kids and pushes them on me. They have called me dad every time they have seen me and have asked why I don't want them. I'm not sure how old they are, both are definitely younger than 8.\n\nI told my ex to stop using her kids that way and that I would not change my mind. She didn't listen.\n\nThe last time she showed up with them was at my son's sport game. Her kids came to sit by me and started calling me dad and saying they loved me. I decided that it had gone on too long and took them aside and told them I was not their dad, that their mom was mistaken and that I was sorry they had been led to believe something that wasn't true. They got upset and my ex raged at me and told me it was not my place.

She is messing with their heads mentally and coaching them on what to say to you. As well as making them believe you \"the father\" don't want them. Get her toxic self away from you, your children and call whoever you need to so those babies can get some help.", "Absolutely NTA and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been put in this position. It\u2019s strange their mum isn\u2019t pursuing their actual father to be a dad to them but I suspect coming to you because you stepped up before (which is commendable and your 2 children as so fortunate to have you). You must seem like an easy target to her. \nI hope she realises that this behaviour will traumatise her kids, and I hope you get some peace soon.", "NTA\n\nCan someone tie this woman's tubes the next time she gives birth? \n\nLike, she's lucky you took in one child that isn't yours. She's being ridiculous!\nGet a restraining order.\nIt sucks those poor kids had to learn the truth in a hard way but the needed the truth.", "NTA.\n\nAnd have you considered a restraining order? I assume you already have sole custody of your two kids, but even if she wanted shared custody, that can still be done with a restraining order in place.\n\nI find this rather comical, in a sick sort of way, that it's apparently \"her place\" to tell two children that ***aren't*** yours that you're their father, but it's not \"your place\" to tell these misguided children that you're ***not*** their father.\n\nTo say nothing of the fact that she wants to treat you like the divorced parent of her two kids, complete with child support. The presumption of this woman! I'm assuming she also wants alimony. Given her entitlement, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nOne minor quibble I have is that you told the kids that their mother was \"mistaken.\" She's not \"mistaken.\" She's lying. She might not be certain as to who the father(s) of her latest children are, but she does know it's not you.\n\nI'm very concerned about her two newest children, though. I realize it's not your problem, and consequently, not for you to be the solution. I wouldn't ask you to take these two kids in, but perhaps CPS? Those kids need the authorities to intervene.", "NTA you explained the situation to them in a age appropriate way and really that's all you could do but I'm not gonna fault her for thinking she could get you to take care of the new kids because you took on her other kid. In her mind that's what you do \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA, your ex needs to start taking some responsibility for her children. What a weirdo.", "NTA, adopting your son was an incredibly generous thing to do for him but that doesn't mean you have to take care of all the kids your ex pops out.\n\nYou were right to tell those kids you're not their dad. You've saved them a lot of hurt and confusion in the future even if they don't understand now. \n\nI very much hope CPS finds those kids somewhere else to live. Your ex is the reason I think mandatory sterilisation should be a thing until you pass a test proving you can parent.", ">She accused me of saying they weren't good enough since I stepped up and raised my son when he wasn't really mine and her younger kids should not be different. \n\n>AITA?\n\nHell, NTA!", "NTA, the fact you chose to take care of the first two already shows how good of a person you are, it may seem harsh to some people but telling them was better than going with the lie.", "NTA, you raised your daughter and her (step)sibling and I applaud you for that. \n\nYou're not responsible for your ex's inability to raise kids. She couldn't raise the first two so why did she get pregnant again? She didn't learn. She does not want to learn. Those other  two are not yours biologically you are not responsible for them and your relationship with her ended years ago.\n\nIt's an AH move from her to force responsibility on you but you stand with your boundaries and I hope you continue on doing so.\nI trust you are a good father to your two children. Raising one is hard enough, let alone two. You did your part.\n\nIf I'd be in your shoes I'd get the police involved so that she can't come to your house anymore. I mean she never showed up for years, she's not a mom for your kids, just an egg donor tbh.", "NTA\nJesus Christ! What the hell???\nYou are an admirable person for taking care of the son.\nMaybe consider getting a restraining order?", "Bloody hell is this real? This woman who apparently wants no kids at all keeps having kids and trying to get her ex to raise her children?? It sounds like the plot of a soap opera or something. \n\nRefusing to raise or support the younger two definitely doesn't make you an AH, what's to stop her from showing up every few years with more kids and dropping them off with you or expecting you to be responsible for them..? \n\nUltimately NTA but it's not the kids' fault either, maybe there was a better way of handling it for their sake? Like warning your ex that you'd tell them if she tried to force them on you one more time? *How* you told them is important but not in the post too, these reasons make me slightly lean towards E.S.H.", ">my ex raged at me and told me it was not my place\n\nNot your place? Not your *place*?!?\n\nEither you are their father and therefore get equal say in what the children are told (and equal responsibility for the consequences) OR you are not their father and therefore have no obligation to play along with her manipulative game\n\nNTA\n\nI feel really bad for those children. Their mother is a huge AH, and her manipulations are going to cause them issues with trust and attachment for the rest of their lives.\n\nYou may want to report the situation to CPS... Your ex is clearly unstable and is looking to unload her kids. At some point, she's going to recognize that it's futile to keep pushing you, and I'm really concerned what her backup plan might look like. She genuinely might abandon them or leave them with someone truly unsuitable", "INFO:\n\nWhat efforts have you made to get her to stop showing up to your house?

But \"look kids, your mum is lying, I have no idea who your dad is but it's not me and I want nothing to do with you\" is quite cruel; although I don't think the person who agreed to raise two children on their own knowing one of them is someone else's would handle it like that. But apparently and understandably OP was on edge because of this AH of an ex and it all happened in public presumably in front of the friends of the older kids and their parents, so it might have come out less than delicate. \n\nAlso, from the younger kids' perspective, their own dad rejected them, refused that he's their dad and probably lied to them to get rid of them because he doesn't love them as much as he loves the older kids. That's most likely what they thought in that moment, which is what I was considering.", "Good. \n\nAt this point, you've done everything that is within your power to do: the proper authorities know, you've told the kids the truth, and you've informed your ex that you will not take them. \n\nYou can give yourself permission to stop engaging with her: don't let her in if she shows up on your doorstep, don't answer her calls, don't respond if she approaches you in public.
