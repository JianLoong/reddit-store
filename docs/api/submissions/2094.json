Given her entitlement, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nOne minor quibble I have is that you told the kids that their mother was \"mistaken.\" She's not \"mistaken.\" She's lying. She might not be certain as to who the father(s) of her latest children are, but she does know it's not you.\n\nI'm very concerned about her two newest children, though.

She said we can do injectable BC instead and it won't have those side effects! I again stressed, are you sure? Because for some reason I *do not* react well to BC but also I do not want to be pregnant, so that would be great! \n\nShe skimmed over the possible side effects, telling me this BC ws temporary and was better than surgery because \"you might change your mind\". Brushed aside how badly I react to BC. Told me \"you might gain weight but that's manageable! This won't cause the side effects you're worried about, it isn't the same type of BC.\" I let her inject me because I explained, over and over, how badly that BC affects me and she reassured me, over and over, this shot wouldn't do that. I trusted her to understand why the medication I listed affected me and that this shot did not have a chance of doing these things. \n\nI had the side effects mentioned. I ended up losing nearly half a year of my life to managing the side effects and not being able to do anything else, including work. It was life threatening. They were exactly the symptoms I described because there was nothing different from this shot, she just didn't think it was as bad as I said it was. \n\nShe didn't take any responsibility. Even in the middle of all that when I said, \"This is why I kept trying to tell you how badly BC affects me, I want surgery\" she told me that \"We haven't tried every option of temporary BC yet, give the next one a chance.\" I don't blame her because it's a very common problem in America that women's reactions or the side effects from BC is severely under-reported and under-studied, so it's very common to dismiss these kinds of problems. But it makes it hard for myself and others, thousands of others, with the same story to trust the next doctor, the next, the next.

Sounds like you need a restraining order. She\u2019s harassing you.", ">my ex raged at me and told me it was not my place. She accused me of saying they weren't good enough since I stepped up and raised my son when he wasn't really mine and her younger kids should not be different.\n\nPlease tell me that you laughed in her face when she said that. Like tell her it is obvious that taking care of the child that isn't yours gave her the impression that you are someone she can choose to take advantage of whenever she chooses but she's not entitled to make any decisions about who you choose to parent. \n\nYou just have to keep telling her that she doesn't get to decide.", "Nta , it was a different situation with the child you adopted. It\u2019s been YEARS . U don\u2019t owe her new children what you gave to her son . You were coparenting with her at the time it made sense to take in her son . It seems like she has some issues that she needs to work on and CPS needs to be notified .", "NTA \u2018nuff said", "NTA.  This is so awful:  her behavior is flat out abusive.  I don\u2019t know the right thing to do.  You certainly aren\u2019t obligated to adopt all of this woman\u2019s children.", "Im sorry, im still stuck on how she offered to fucked sell you her child. How is she not in prison for human trafficking? NTA but you need to call CPS", "Yeah, OP *seriously* needs to start some CYA. Hell, he should\u2019ve started the CYA years ago after getting the second kid. A restraining order would be a good first step. He should also consider paternity tests, to prove that he isn\u2019t the father. Otherwise she\u2019ll likely try to tell the courts that he\u2019s a deadbeat father and sue for child support. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll spin some kind of story to try and garner sympathy. Courts *have* ruled in the past that father *figures* can be made to pay child support, even if they aren\u2019t a child\u2019s father. OP needs to do everything he can to avoid this, because otherwise he\u2019ll be on the hook with this toxic woman for the next decade.\n\nNext, OP needs to call CPS and alert them that she\u2019s trying to abandon her children. That she\u2019s manipulative and emotionally abusive. The children have *clearly* been led to believe that OP is their father, in an attempt to guilt him into accepting them. She\u2019s toxic and is using her own children as manipulation tools, at the cost of their own emotional well-being. These poor children likely don\u2019t even realize anything is wrong with the situation, because it\u2019s all they know.", "She can petition for child support but it doesn\u2019t mean the father(s) will pay, or even keep their legal/well paying jobs where their wages can be garnished. \n\nI agree though with the other comments though, OP already took in a kid that\u2019s not his, she probably thought he\u2019d be enough of a sucker, or even have the financial capacity to do it again for 2 more kids. \n\nIt\u2019s probably not JUST the money, raising kids is a lot of grunt work and child support generally doesn\u2019t cover all expenses for a thriving child.", "Yeah what I meant by the daughter is the fact he raised her alone", "Like trying to smell the number 9\u2026", "CPS needs to know that mom is telling these kids he's their father. And the kids are being used and manipulated and lied to.", "That\u2019s bull, at least partly. Why can men so easily get it done? Why have my friends been asked what their husband thinks? Why can I get multiple boob jobs, a nose job, any other plastic surgery, lasik, but not get approved for sterilization EVER? If it was just what you said, it wouldn\u2019t be so damn hard. It\u2019s about seeing us as incubators, not humans. It\u2019s about how people can\u2019t fathom some don\u2019t want what they want most- children. It\u2019s about not respecting our life decisions.", "Do you know what episode of law and order that was?", "> If I remember correctly, she found out she was pregnant again either during the trail or on her way to prison.", "[removed]", "A slim majority", "That's the difference between should (more of a recommendation) and needs to (more of something enforcable), as far as I can tell.\n\nI'm definitely not arguing forced sterilization here, but would recommend that woman does get sterilized.

[Here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNy6F7ZwX8I) if you haven't. If it's trying to explain the fucked up justice system, it's purposefully doing so from a cop's eye view. Unfortunately, this has influenced the way that Americans view the police.", "Hormones can horribly mess up some women, and which set of hormones does what varies widely. Some women can\u2019t use any hormonal bc. Some can use one but get sick (mentally, physically, or both) on another. Some have severe emotional instabilities and even violent tendencies on certain bc. And some have beneficial side effects and love the stabilization it brings to their mind or body. It\u2019s really a crapshoot and many women have to try multiple types of bc to find the right one. So just mandating one on people could really mess her up.", "NTA. Honestly you should call child protective services on this psycho.", "NTA. I am sorry for the kids but you are NTA in this situation. Make sure she hasn't tried to put you down as a POC at school or other locations or indicated that you ARE those kids father.", "Your ex is hurting those kids. NTA", "NTA", "I\u2019m livid! I\u2019m sorry if she is mentally unstable but it\u2019s incredible selfish and disgusting to manipulate those children just to get your money, you did more than enough by raising the other kid she left. \n\nYou need to take matters to CPS or get a freaking restraining order because that\u2019s literally harassment.", "NTA. School of hard knocks. In this case better sooner than later. Can only hope mother deals with it therapy or gives them up.

I would try and get a restriction order on the woman though.", "I agree that WBTA if you didn\u2019t report and get a restraining order. I was also in an abusive home for 8 years until I was put into the foster system and found an awesome family. Thank you for helping those kids and for taking care of your son and daughter. You saved them years of trauma and deep rooted issues", "Sounded to me like he told them this info pretty angrily, but that's an assumption. I probably would have started by telling them that sometimes people lie very horrible lies in order to get what they want, and tell them gently.\n\nBut I'm not sure that's much better. He was really put between a rock and a hard place.", "I thought given he took them aside to say it so they wouldn't be embarrassed he probably told them as gently as one can that he's not their dad.

Like, what is she doing with these other guys? Poor kids. Hope she finds a way to the responsible path and stops birthing kids she clearly doesn't want. No child should suffer that.", "NTA. She is seriously unstable.", "This was really hard to read. The poor children.", "Yes, ex needs some help. Something mental is going on in her brain. She is not stable to raise any children. Go to CPS. Get a lawyer for good measure, incase she trues any funny business, but you seem to have a good chance of taking the kids away from her toxic behavior. They need a better home with people who live and can care for them 24/7", "I'm not 100% certain house CPS works on things like this, but perhaps they will find the children's true fathers and maybe they will step up for the children.
