But for someone like this woman,  who is clearly not capable of caring for her kids yet keeps having more, not to mention how abusive she is, I would honestly be in favour of it. However unethical it is to force sterilization, it's for the sake of the kids and unborn kids. No kid should have to grow up under such circumstances.", "I don't doubt you at all. I was more trying to make the point that things that we all recognise need to be done, we should try to get done. I wasn't saying the system in your country is already great and we should model more things off that.", "I would be too, but we come into a slippery slope territory. Re: Eugenics.", "Sure, no one in any position of power has ever used laws that\u2019s seem ok on the surface but can be twisted to their own wants and eugenics policies have only ever been enacted in nazi Germany. Go ahead and sterilise anyone you deem should be.", "Of course. It's something to debate in theory, that should never reach practice."]}
