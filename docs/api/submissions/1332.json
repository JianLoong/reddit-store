Josh shouldn't be dishing it out if he's not able to take it.\n\nI'd go low contact with him. No need to apologize. Just don't engage with him in any capacity other than a nod of \"I see that you're here\" when in a group setting with him. No one needs a person like him around. There's a difference between joking around and just being mean, Josh sounds like he's just mean.", "Somewhere in between NTA and ESH.\n\nMaking fun of someone's major is an asshole move in general. In isolation, it's an asshole move for sure.\n\nBut given the context of how mean he has been, it's understandable. Like, did OP make fun of him with malicious intent (ESH) or was OP just pushed to a breaking point (NTA)?\n\nAnyways, OP has the right idea of cutting off this guy who clearly sounds like TA (both in this situation and in general). But imo OP's main problem is the roommate who wants OP to patch things up. That sounds inconsiderate of the roommate.", "Nta but if you keep being a pushover I'm gonna call you one .

Why does she insist you befriend your bully?", "NTA, Tell him in front of everyone next time that every time he attacks someone in the group, you're going to fight back. And if she says something, fight back until she realizes that actions have consequences, and you talk about her too.

Josh is an ass and had it coming.", "NTA\n\nYou gave back what you've been getting. But, why are you around this group at all? They all very clearly support him and his behavior and not you. Had someone like that join my friend group once. Said something around the lines of what he says. My entire group couldn't get rid of them fast enough. The fact that he remains means it's time to find new friends. \n\nYour other friend had a break down over you cutting this guy off but not over how he treats you. How he's treated matters more than how your treated. Why put yourself through that?", "NTA. I don't understand why anyone is your group hangs out with him.", "NTA \nIt's hard and work to make new friends, but I don't think anyone here is actually your friend. If they were, they'd call out his shitty behavior too. And the girl crying over it can get over herself. She feels the need to center herself in your pain, that's manipulative.", "Cut him off. Cut off any friends that demand you hang around his and his abuse for their sake. They ALL suck. \n\nDid you point out that he constantly crosses lines with you? Why are you friends with any of these people? Make new friends at your college. And find a new room mate. Your current roommate is ridiculous. She's crying because you won't tolerate an abuser???", "Josh is not your friend. Your roommate/friend's crying about that argument is manipulative. Does want to date him or something? \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHe had it coming. Also you do need a better group of people to hang out with.", "NTA but I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019ve remained friends with someone who is so mean to you??", "NTA.\n\nJosh is not a friend, but a bully. It doesn't matter why he is doing this; he is still being cruel. He can dish it, but not take it.\n\nHonestly, your insecure friend is forcing you to spend time with someone who is abusive to you. I understand not wanting to hurt their feelings, but at the end of the day it is between you and Josh.\n\nDon't apologize.", "Why do you call him a friend? Why do you spend any time in this person's presence at all\u203d He's a cruel person gaslighting you by claiming he's \"joking\". Why are you putting up with this bs?", "NTA\n\nClassic bully can dish it out but can't take it. Don't put up with it - squash him every time he gets offensive. Keep demanding he be respectful or leave the group.", "NTA\n\n\"I wasn't joking, I was trying to hurt you. You are a bad person and you deserve to be treated the way you treat other people.\"", "She says she understands why I don\u2019t hang out with him anymore but that she wishes we were friends again. We three were like the three musketeers until recently. She has issues with abandonment and being socially inadequate.", "NTA \n\nThis is really good advice. You will never be able to \"fix\" or \"stop\"  your bully, his manipulative enabler or your indifferent posse. \n\n\nBut you do have control over who you let into your life. If they are an unavoidable presence, which could happen at a small school, make them aquaintances with whom you are polite and neutral without making plans together.  Instead, reach out to the larger arts community by attending openings and talks. Enter your work into shows. Hang it at the local coffee shops. Find out about internships, mentoring programs, volunteer teaching, etc. Artists' cooperatives are a good place to start because they are usually the most supportive of new artists because they've all been where you are.  In other words, surround yourself with people who share your interests and values.", "I\u2019m not the only one he does this to. Josh attacks everyone in the group for something about them except the guy he has a crush on. He just does it most towards me and the others chime in with \u201cwhy are you trying to make fun of her for her major? what is wrong with you?\u201d He laughs about that. I left out how up to this point I would respond with \u201cwhat do you go to this school for exactly?\u201d He makes fun of one girl for majoring medicine. He laughs and the insults are so jarring that others don\u2019t take it seriously. He attacks me on everything else in private so they have no opinion on other stuff.", "No Josh is gay lol", "More like he\u2019s a packaged deal with the friend group. We are all part of a club and hang our afterwards. Most people in it go home on weekends since they live locally and work during the week so this is the one day we can all hang out together. Josh is friends with them too.", "I put friend in quotes for that reason. I only see him in group settings and this is one of them. I like everyone else in the group and the rest are on my \u201cside.\u201d", "Be that as it may, Josh is a bully. You don't have to, and shouldn't, spend time with him. You can assure her that you're still her friend and remind her that her mental health likely would be in a better place without him being mean to her and her friends all the time, but don't let her anxiety be the reason you stick around to be abused.\n\nDo you have any idea what happened to make him start behaving this way?", "Her issues shouldn't impact your mental health, though. She's being thoroughly unreasonable.", "Then why is he still in the group? Who actually enjoys being harassed all the time? I'd start talking to people about removing him from the group.", "Really doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s worth it. Everyone just lets him berates and craps all over them? What do you really get out of this friend group?", "Maybe you should decide if you want to hang out with a group of people who are ok standing by while someone verbally and emotionally abuses you. Real friends would ditch someone who treats you the way this guy does.", "It started recently and we\u2019ve been hanging out for almost 2 semesters. This is new for them, not for me", "It\u2019s something he has recently started doing and everyone fires back at him and he takes it as a joke, he only has a problem when I do.", "He does it to everyone except one person and he has a crush on them. We all respond with the same thing \u201cwhy are you attacking people\u2019s majors?\u201d and \u201cwhat do you do exactly\u201d I\u2019m the first person to actively throw it back", "It isn\u2019t joking if he\u2019s the only one laughing. I wish that every single time he verbally attacks someone, they respond loudly and firmly with phrases like \u201cwhy would you say such a mean thing?\u201d \u201cAre you trying to be hurtful?\u201d \u201cYou are being unkind\u201d. Call him out every single time that he is being inappropriate. If he mumbles it is only a joke, tell him firmly that it is cruel and he needs to stop.", "Why do any of you put up with this shit? He's demeaning to all of you so why do any of you hang out with him? The more details you offer the more ridiculous it sounds that anyone in your group associates with this guy."]}
