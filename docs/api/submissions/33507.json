Since we've been kids we always hung out together, shared friends groups/hobbies/interests and genuinely liked being around each other. However, she recently got a new gf (29F), Trisha, and our dynamic has changed. \nI don't care for Trisha at all. She's not really rude or unpleasant, but I just don't vibe with her and think she's a bit annoying. I've expressed this to Sam which resulted in one of our biggest arguments to date. I understand that my opinion doesn't matter in their relationship, but I just don't enjoy being around Trisha, so Sam and I have seen each other less and less, and have been getting into more and more arguments.\nI recently moved halfway across the country for my job and Sam asked if she can come and visit. I excitedly said yes, as I wanted to show her all the new hiking spots by me and I genuinely wanted to have Sister Time again. However, she then asked if Trisha could come along as well. I don't really have the space or means of hosting at my new place, and despite Sam saying they would happily sleep on the floor or the couch, I just really didn't want to be \"On\" while she was around. I told my sister I really just wanted it to be her and I hanging out and exploring this side of the country, and thus began another argument. Eventually I told her \"either come alone or don't come at all\" which I half assumed would put an end to the visitation plans, but later she agreed she would come alone. \nFast forward to when she was planning on visiting, I'm getting excited and have a whole plan for the week mapped out. Sam texts me when she leaves her place and since I know it's a 15 hour drive (yes, she chose to take it straight through) she would be arriving at my place around 10 pm. 10 pm rolls around and she knocks at my door, and I open it up to both Sam and Trisha.\nI didn't even know what to say or do, I was so shocked. Both of them looked happy to see me, but I just couldn't understand what happened. Eventually, the anger and embarrassment caught up with me and I refused to let them in. Things got a little heated and frustrating and it resulted in me telling them angrily to find a motel somewhere or drive home. They both chose to get a motel, after many curse words and yelling, which is where they are right now.\nMy family is furious with me for making them look for a motel so late at night, even though it's a pretty highly populated area with many options around. I'm quite embarrassed and worked up over the whole thing, but don't think I made the wrong move considering I set my boundaries pretty clearly earlier? I feel like I mightve overreacted, as I genuinely don't think Sam or Trisha will ever speak to me again. I just can't believe my entire relationship with my sister has come to such a screeching halt over a gf she's had for just over a year.

Is it worth blowing up your relationship with sis for?", "NTA for setting boundaries and sticking to them. Your sister tried to pull a fast one on you and is now paying the price of a hotel room for it. \n\nUltimately, however, you will need to decide if losing your sister is worth it. This relationship may or may not last, but the hurt you just caused will be something she remembers for a long time. If you want her in your life, you need to have a one on one with her and let her know how you felt when she lied about coming alone, and also springing someone she knows you're not fond of on you and into your personal space.", "Is this issue really just that you don't vibe with her gf? Cause that seems like a crazy thing to lose your sister over. What if they get married or they stay togther forever without marriage? At one point do you say oh well we'll never be sisters again cause i don't like the vibes. You're allowed to have boundaries but your reasoning for not liking her gf is shaky. Your sister should have kept the trip the way y'all planned it, but you need to go ahead and let her know you've decided that if she dates people and wants to be in your life then she has to make sure you give final approval on future partners and once she breaks up with her gf you'll be ready for her apology and the keys to her life.", "NTA. Nobody should show up with an uninvited guest and expect them to stay in your home. Your sister is an AH for trying to force another person into your home.\n\nHowever, working out a reasonable solution (such as not hosting them but getting to know your sister's gf while they stay nearby) would have been a good way to work this all out ahead of time. Your sister should have pushed for this, rather than lying to you that she'd come alone. You could have offered this instead of refusing any contact with your sister's SO.\n\nThe relationship between you and your sister has been seriously damaged, by both of you, at this point. I hope you get to talk it out with her, and that she's sorry for lying and bringing an uninvited guest--and that you're sorry for rejecting someone your sister loves (originally, not as a houseguest because that's fine) based on not \"vibing\".", "INFO: Has Sam had other serious partners before this one, and how did your dynamic change with them? Have you had serious partners and how did they get along with Sam?\n\nYou didn\u2019t mention comparing Trisha to anyone else so it immediately made me think this is Sam\u2019s first serious relationship. If that\u2019s the case, you sound like a jealous little sister. It\u2019s normal and natural for siblings to spend less time one on one as you grow up and have families of your own. \n\nIt was unquestionably terrible of Sam to lie about coming alone and surprise you with Trish. But it sure sounds like you were being unreasonable first. \n\nAt this point you\u2019ll have to decide which is more important, not having to see Trish or seeing your sister. They\u2019re a package deal. I don\u2019t like my brother in law very much but I\u2019m writing this comment from his couch right now as I\u2019m visiting for Christmas. They live far away and have kids so if I wasn\u2019t willing to put up with him sometimes I\u2019d literally never see my sister again. So I paste on a smile and deal with it. All-or-nothing is not a very realistic approach to adult sibling relationships.", "Ugh, I feel I am going to get downvoted by the \"but your boundaries\" crowd, but here we go... ESH.\n\nSam absolutely should not have surprised you by showing up at your door with Trish.  She set up a situation rife for drama and embarrassment for both you and Trish.  She's an AH.\n\nThat said, I really think refusing a family member entry to your home and making them get a hotel in the middle of the night should be reserved for relationships with a lot of history and drama--in other words, something more than being \"a bit annoying.\" I also think it's a bit selfish of you to demand your sister travel cross-country to see you but not be allowed to bring her girlfriend. You're essentially saying \"use your limited time and money and PTO only for me\" when it's reasonable and even expected that these things would also be shared with the person's significant other.\n\nBottom line... you admit that Trish is \"not really rude or unpleasant,\" and yet, you were exactly that to Trish and Sam.", "ESH. You had every right to say Trisha wasn\u2019t welcome but the way you handled the conflict in the moment has ensured that you\u2019ll never speak to your sister again unless and until Trisha does something horrible to her and their relationship ends.  The thing to do was let them stay the night then send them on their way in the morning. \n\nYour reasoning for disliking Trisha doesn\u2019t line up with your extreme animosity toward her visiting you. Typically we put up with an annoying wife/girlfriend of our siblings. It\u2019s a charitable thing to show our family we love them. If she\u2019d stolen from you or said awful things to you or about you that\u2019s different but you and she just not \u201cvibing\u201d doesn\u2019t grant you the moral high ground to behave as you did.", "ESH your sister for lying to you, you for being so dismissive of her partner.

Like what did you expect her to do break up because you think Trish is 'annoying'?", "Either your sister flat-out lied to you or Trisha is manipulative and controlling...maybe both.\n\nYou told your sister you wanted time alone with her. She *chose* to blindside you by showing up with her gf and trying to force you to accept the consequences of *her* decision. Not cool.\n\nWhat they did was rude and entitled. Frankly, I'd tell them to enjoy their stay and ignore them. If they can't respect your request to have some one-on-one time with your sister, that's on THEM. Don't let any flying monkeys try to make you feel guilty for sending them to a motel. They are 100 percent responsible for that outcome.\n\nI'm so sorry your sister couldn't be an adult and come to visit ALONE, as she said she would. Gentle hugs.", "NTA. I started reading this and it seemed you were kind of jealous, which is valid but not exactly a valid reason to not suck it up (it's her gf not yours etc.)\n\nBut now I think you downplayed your initial feelings. It's not \"we don't vibe together,\" you must have smelled something off with her and/or her relationship with your sister.\n\nIt is not normal for someone 29ish to impose herself like this and definitively not normal for your sister. Yes you made it big but it seems this needed to be addressed", "I see quite a few e s h but considering Trisha was happy to see op its very possible the sister hasn't told her that op doesn't  like her just the siblings are AHs", "Info: Why are you constantly arguing with your sister? You say you don't vibe well with the GF but I don't see why you can't still have a rational conversation. Are there other, specific issues with the GF that causes these arguments?

You said it yourself, she\u2019s not rude or unpleasant, so what\u2019s the beef here? Why do you hate her so much that you\u2019re fighting with your sister all the time over her?

It was messed up of her and naive, knowing how you felt, but still\u2026\u2026. sucks that you really hate this girl enough to turn your sister away like that. Just really cold.\n\nAlso think, they\u2019ve been together for just over a year. If they stay together for longer, are you really never gonna get used to Trisha?

Honestly, we were probably married a few years before she did like him, and even 10 years into our marriage, he still does a lot of things that rub her wrong. But, she decided upfront that she loved me more than she disliked him. So she tolerated him. Then she got to know him and found activities they could both enjoy.

Why should OP basically be forced to house someone she doesn\u2019t like, and who doesn\u2019t really like her? NO ONE should be made to feel uncomfortable in their own home.

It's simply inacceptable to agree to a plan and then changing it secretly and forcing it on the other person.\n\nIt's not like OPs sister couldn't have known after OP explicutly told her to come either alone or not at all, it's as clear as it gets.", "OP did not \"force\" family to get a motel room in the middle of the night, sister had plenty of time to plan the trip (and a room near by) and tried to ambush OP in the middle of the night.\nOP is NTA", "Exactly.

First, shutting the door on them right then.  She could have let them in and told them that tomorrow they'd have to leave.

Second, deciding that she finds a sister's gf \"annoying\" and is willing to use that as her hill to die on.  I mean, really?  She never spends time with annoying people?

Because \"hey we can visit, the two of us can hangout one on one and then I'll go out with gf\"\n\nLike zero attempts to compromise from sister, OP doesn't even talk bad about gf yet you are all trying to demonize them just cause they are unwilling to hang out with someone they dislike, lol", "If the reason she did so is homophobia, then it's absolutely an easy YTA.\nI'm giving OP the benefit of the doubt and assuming she's not bigoted, but doing something otherwise OK because you're a bigot makes you a giant flaming asshole.", "She did not destroy her relationship \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and even if it was strained, OP's sister really thought just bringing her along after being told not to was a good idea? They're both at fault the same amount up until her sister decided to explicitly go against what she said. Another part of being an adult is respecting the boundaries of others, especially when involving their home and who they say is or isn't allowed to be there. I love how yall will sit here and fight tooth and nail to say the sister is an ass for not liking her sisters gf even if the reasons aren't what you would like to hear. You're 100% allowed to not like someone just off intuition or gut feeling. She's not going out of her way to be rude or hostile towards her sis's gf. Just doesn't want to be around her. Also, relationships are a two-way street. Either sister can reach out.", "In this case? Absolutely. \n\nCome alone or don\u2019t come. \n\nShe came with an unwelcome guest. \n\nThey are in an area with ample arrangements to go elsewhere and get a room. \n\nThere is no scenario here where I blame OP at all. Even if I wouldn\u2019t have done the same. They were very clear in the expectations.", "We don\u2019t know if the sister has ever relayed anything to her GF that\u2019s been said or gone on between the two sisters. GF may be completely in the dark about the whole arrangement. I\u2019ve been in that position before where I didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t invited to a particular family function (my in-laws and I have a wonderful relationship but this was for immediate family only) but my boyfriend-now husband-didn\u2019t tell me. SUPER awkward until I sussed out the situation and removed myself. Now it\u2019s a running joke we make.", "Depends what sister told Trisha.", "No, it\u2019s controlling to refuse to accept your sibling\u2019s or close friend\u2019s SO in the first place (to the point she\u2018s been having lots of fights with sister) simply because you don\u2019t \u201cvibe\u201d with them. Doesn\u2019t mean she had to house Trisha, but it\u2019s weird that she absolutely wouldn\u2019t when there\u2019s no real explanation of the bad blood and she misses her sister. I\u2019ll allow it\u2019s an attitude anyone is entitled to have and set firm boundaries around, but don\u2019t be surprised when refusal to have any relationship at all with the SO blows up your relationship with sibling or close friend.", "I don't disagree. Not going to jump to conclusions based on baseless assumptions. Off the information given shes NTA in my opinion.", "You can be \u201cnot a doormat\u201d and \u201cnot an asshole\u201d at the same time.  Fuck reddit is full of inflexible uncool aholes.  \nI hope she enjoys the ruined relationship with her sister.", "You\u2019d think OP would care about her sister  not taking a 15 hour road trip by herself. I\u2019d certainly feel better if my sibling had a companion.", "You sound like a very selfish person.  That will get very lonely one day.", "I've never ever heard of arguing with a friend about their partner. How does this happen?", "I mean this section at the end also indicates OP sees it as \"your gf or me.\" I really don't think it's such a stretch.\n\n> I just can't believe my entire relationship with my sister has come to such a screeching halt over a gf she's had for just over a year.", "> No, it\u2019s controlling to refuse to accept your sibling\u2019s or close friend\u2019s SO in the first place\n\nHard disagree. Your place, your rules.", "How is it controlling? She doesn't have to want to be around anyone. She's not trying to stop her sister from being with her gf she's simply saying she's not spending time with sister's gf. I think trying to force gf on OP is doing more to blow up the relationship than accepting gf and OP won't be besties.", "What exactly are you suggesting? Because either OP let them stay (doormat) or didn't (asshole, according to you). I don't see a middle ground, here. There's no compromise other than what they ended up doing, which was getting a motel. \n\nSam's the one who decided to flex on OP and these are the consequences.", "You don\u2019t know anything about me. I even said I wouldn\u2019t have done this. But while I would not do what OP did I would NEVER consider for a second doing what their sister did and putting them in that position", "I have friends who have had partners who have pulled some unacceptable shit, if I hear about it then I'm going to voice my thoughts on it. Sometimes it's resulted in disagreements depending on how strongly we've felt about it. The couple of times it's happened it's been sort of like 'hey you need to tell them to cut this out' or 'they should treat you better', etc. \n\nSome of them have worked past those issues with their partner, some of them are now exes, but I've never asked or expected them to break up because of it.", "That could easily just be OP referring back to how their relationship is having trouble, and it's wild to me that people are ignoring the fact that maybe that's because Sam is doing asshole things like lying to OP and then showing up on her doorstep expecting OP to just be a doormat and give way to her. If she's willing to do that imagine what she's doing the rest of the time.", "I dont know. If her sister isn't willing to visit without her gf then she's at least partly the one making it all or nothing. OP might be making it gf or me but sis is also making it both or none (as shown by lying about gfs presence on this trip).", "Whatever. This sub rewards assholes as long as they claim \u201cboundaries\u201d.  I can be annoyed at something without going nuclear.  Most normal people can.", "Right, I never would have gone to visit my miserable sister in the first place.", "Not ignoring that at all, I think it's ESH and Sam should never have brought an explicitly-unwelcome guest.\n\nI just also think OP's reasons for disliking the gf do not justify the apparently relationship-destroying fallout she's brought on herself, and she needs to accept people start their own families.", "I'm gonna politely say that in other words, it's clear you just think that OP should be a doormat. I disagree, because I know from experience that's the way you teach someone like OP's sister (who obviously thought she was going to get her way) that stunts like this work. The *only* way to stop them from doing it again is to actually put your foot down and be firm. \n\nIs it fun? No. Does it make them mad? Yeah. Do they learn? Not always, but more often than if you give in."]}
