After a week or two i asked her out on a dinner date, she wanted to bring a friend along. I hesitated at first, not becuase i don't want to pay for 3 people, but i don't want to be the 3rd wheel. However, i agreed, thinking she would feel more comfortable with her friend on the date.\n\nI made reservation at a casual restaurant that is build over a large man-made pool, open-air, nicely decorated, good food. The table i reserved is in the more private area where couples usually dine. In short, the place is casual enough for 3 and romantic enough for a date; and if the date went badly, at least the food is good.\n\nOn the date night i went to pick her up just to find out that she invited another of her friends without telling me, so there are 3 of them in total. Obviously, I was flabergasted. They greet me and jumped in my car. There were just talking among themselve the entire way to the restaurant, i might as well be an uber driver at that point.\n\nWe had to move to a bigger table, the restaurant wasnt fully reserved, so we dint have to wait for long. The girls were having a blast, they ordered expensive dishes, went nuts on drinks. I was pretty much excluded from their conversation, anything i say would be ignored, none of them even make a glance towards me. It seems like i don't exist then.\n\nIt was very clear to me that she and her friends are on girls nightout and i am a sucker thats gonna pay for them. With that, i ordered the most expensive steak and other dishes piling up the bill, stuffing my face, then excused myself to the washroom, get in my car and drove back home.\n\nOn the way back i got 20ish calls that i didn't bother to pick up. When i got home, i was bombarded with messages and was called asshole and more.", "created_utc": 1678585639, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11p1tvn/aita_for_bailing_out_on_dinner_date_without/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He isn\u2019t an asshole because he is a \u201csore loser.\u201d Not by any means, honestly. How is he supposed to make conversation with his date with her nobodies constantly talking?", "False! Haha. He isn\u2019t a gold digger. They were all going to make him pay for the date, obviously. And she had 0 right to bring additional people on the date. Yes, he probably should have paid for his own, but she sucks more. There\u2019s no misogyny here, that word is being thrown around.", "Did she being friends? Did she expect him to pay?
