However, i agreed, thinking she would feel more comfortable with her friend on the date.\n\nI made reservation at a casual restaurant that is build over a large man-made pool, open-air, nicely decorated, good food. The table i reserved is in the more private area where couples usually dine. In short, the place is casual enough for 3 and romantic enough for a date; and if the date went badly, at least the food is good.\n\nOn the date night i went to pick her up just to find out that she invited another of her friends without telling me, so there are 3 of them in total. Obviously, I was flabergasted. They greet me and jumped in my car. There were just talking among themselve the entire way to the restaurant, i might as well be an uber driver at that point.\n\nWe had to move to a bigger table, the restaurant wasnt fully reserved, so we dint have to wait for long. The girls were having a blast, they ordered expensive dishes, went nuts on drinks.

It seems like i don't exist then.\n\nIt was very clear to me that she and her friends are on girls nightout and i am a sucker thats gonna pay for them. With that, i ordered the most expensive steak and other dishes piling up the bill, stuffing my face, then excused myself to the washroom, get in my car and drove back home.\n\nOn the way back i got 20ish calls that i didn't bother to pick up.

And leaving someone else with your bill makes you a huge ah. I hope she takes you to small claims court. \n\nYou should have asked if its (still) a date when she invited the first friend. Ppl usually don't bring a \"safe\" person on a date when the date happens in a restaurant, only if its a more private set up.

You're meant to do the right thing for the sake of doing the right thing & your own soul. \n\nExacting petty revenge, is not the right thing.", "Not to mention, even though they're not supposed to, restaurants will sometimes force the server to pay for tables who refuse. Realistically, most places don't actually do anything to the table that refuses to pay (except banning them from returning) - they write it off or they blame the server, because it's actually pretty hard to get that money from the customer once they've refused. Literally that's why it's more common now to make people pay before they eat.\n\nSo there's a solid chance an innocent person ended up suffering the consequences of their actions, *not* the people who actually wronged him.", "Didn\u2019t even think about the tip to the server. The one that probably got most screwed was the unfortunate person who had to wait on them. \n\nThey all suck.", "Because he absolutely owed for what *he* ate. He could've sent the same message without sinking to their level, by just paying his portion and letting them pay their own. \n\nNot to mention, some restaurants will actually make the server pay the cost if a table can't or doesn't pay. They shouldn't, but they do. So by intentionally inflating the bill further, OP made that scenario far more likely to occur (by making it more likely that the others wouldn't be able to afford it alone) - *and* increased the amount the server would have to pay, if it came to that. \n\nAll it would've taken for OP to be *completely* blameless would've been him paying for his own part. But he became just as bad as the others.", "No, he agreed to the meet up. It was his own free will to pick them up and also didn't said something when they all jumped in his car, at this point even he had to realise that's not a date. For me when reading it it was clear thats not a date when op mentioned that she told him early on she invited a friend. You don't bring a friend to a date in a restaurant where ppl are around and there is no danger. They misscommunicated and instead of acknowledging it, op decided to punish her."]}
