However, i agreed, thinking she would feel more comfortable with her friend on the date.\n\nI made reservation at a casual restaurant that is build over a large man-made pool, open-air, nicely decorated, good food. The table i reserved is in the more private area where couples usually dine. In short, the place is casual enough for 3 and romantic enough for a date; and if the date went badly, at least the food is good.\n\nOn the date night i went to pick her up just to find out that she invited another of her friends without telling me, so there are 3 of them in total. Obviously, I was flabergasted. They greet me and jumped in my car. There were just talking among themselve the entire way to the restaurant, i might as well be an uber driver at that point.\n\nWe had to move to a bigger table, the restaurant wasnt fully reserved, so we dint have to wait for long.

It seems like i don't exist then.\n\nIt was very clear to me that she and her friends are on girls nightout and i am a sucker thats gonna pay for them. With that, i ordered the most expensive steak and other dishes piling up the bill, stuffing my face, then excused myself to the washroom, get in my car and drove back home.\n\nOn the way back i got 20ish calls that i didn't bother to pick up.
