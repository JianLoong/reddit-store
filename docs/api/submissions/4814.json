Shouldn't your husband talk to his daughter about this? \n\nI do feel you are a bit dismissive of your stepdaughter.

Also I notice how you said three bedrooms; If you & your husband have one room together, what's the second room for? Please don't tell me it's for a child that you have with your husband, because that's even worse trying to exclude Jane.

Leaning towards YTA. People move back home sometimes. Also in college there is often a lot of moving even when you're not in student housing, so it's nice to have additional spaces to store some of your stuff. If she's not taking summer classes it's common to leave student housing empty over the summer and just pay the rent (that's what I did at least. & some of my roommates.)  It's nice to have options. I can't think of a reason why guests would be offended using \"Jane's\" room but if I was Jane I'd be hurt by not having my \"own\" room if there is space for a guest room. Maybe say she can decorate it if she wants but she doesn't need to and that it'll also be used for other guests when y'all have them over and she's gone.\n\nI moved back in with my parents 2/3 of my way through my masters, children are unpredictable.

They\u2019re not victims.", "And the same could happen if a guy the same age was in a car accident. Age gap issues are about power difference and the potential for abuse.", "He\u2019s going to be pushing me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No where does it say the kid graduated. It says she's not in student housing. Usually after the first year or two kids move out of the dorms (student housing) into a nearby apartment with roommates. That said, with today's economy your kid needs a landing place. My judgement is NAH - too little information. Does the daughter even want a room or is this just the husband? Sounds like Mom's place is home.", "OP says their current house with Jane\u2019s room isn\u2019t working bc she has disabilities, so that\u2019s why they are looking to purchase this new home. The part about why they are moving is in the main post.", "Ahhh- and you find that someone with disabilities shouldn't be supported by their spouse in a house that accommodates that.  Gross.", "Don\u2019t put words in my mouth. OP deserves a house that accommodates her, but it\u2019s unfair to wholesale dismiss her husband\u2019s concerns about his college-age daughter losing her room. We don\u2019t know anything about plans when Jane graduates, and news flash, OP also needs to recognize that the dad\u2019s concerns about his daughter and her feeling like part of his new family are valid. It bears further discussion.", "He would be the ah if they had plans and didn't tell op.", "How about because it\u2019s not just up to dad and certainly not up to the daughter. Op is his wife and the bread winner. Adult step kids don\u2019t take priority lol", "How is that putting words in your mouth?  Also- OP is actually the bread winner.  Jane's plans after graduation are her own. It's not up to OP to accommodate her living arrangements.... I would say that OP is actually recognizing her husbands concerns by having the convo.  \"His New Family\"??? Thats a weird statement......"]}
