Leaning towards YTA. People move back home sometimes.

If she's not taking summer classes it's common to leave student housing empty over the summer and just pay the rent (that's what I did at least. & some of my roommates.)  It's nice to have options. I can't think of a reason why guests would be offended using \"Jane's\" room but if I was Jane I'd be hurt by not having my \"own\" room if there is space for a guest room. Maybe say she can decorate it if she wants but she doesn't need to and that it'll also be used for other guests when y'all have them over and she's gone.\n\nI moved back in with my parents 2/3 of my way through my masters, children are unpredictable.

She's on the point of pissing on her husband to show possession.\n\nOP can check in the with the daughter and sort it together as adults to make a room she feels happy in and also practical for guests. What's wrong with having her stepdaughter's choice of duvet cover in the linen cupboard to tow on when she comes to stay?", "It depends on the families. In some families there'd be an expectation of having a place (even if not used fulltime) at the parent's until marriage, for instance. Apparently here the father expects her to have her own place to go home to whenever she likes, and that's what matters.", "Quite the opposite, I left at 18, not that it matters here. But clearly she has a different situation with her mother, and the father had an expectation of her having a room in the new home. It's the stepmother who's not on the same page as everyone else here.", "Exactly my cousin is going to be staying in my 50 year old dads child hood room at my grandmas should he be upset", "21 and roommates does not mean established and stable... most likely school is involved and maybe she might wanna come home still, why does new wife get to set the rules for everyone?\n\n2 other people are mentioned here but neither of their opinions are considered...", "How DARE this woman want to decorate her home?  lol My god- all the title needs to say is \"Stepparent or Stepdaughter\" and its an automatic AH- so dumb", "I think it differs between cultures and upbringings. My grandparents still have my dad's and uncle's room. My parents still have my room.", "No age limit, but yes my grandmother on my mom's side always had room for the kids (my mom, aunt and uncles, all except for one were married/living outside of the family), and while she couldn't financially afford to have extra space near the end, she always reminded us every time we came over that it was home prior to her passing and encouraged us to stay over as much as possible. My grandparents on my dad's side don't lock any of their doors and tell all family to come in and stay over whenever. It's just how it's always been. I intend to do the same if I start a family. As I said, practically the room does exist as a guest room but with the items of said family member stored there (ej. my room at my mom's home has my stuff, my deceased dad's stuff, a bed for guests, some of my hobby stuff, etc.) and I live in a different continent on the other half of the world and have for almost a decade.", "> Should your parents keep a room for their adult married children?\n\nif they want to, they should.", "No. I make more than my husband does and will be likely be contributing more though probably not *significantly* more. The third bedroom is for my office", "Thats my bad. Huge brain fart", ">James and I are looking to purchase a home togethe\n\nIt doesn't matter whether OP initially moved into her husband's house. This will be their new house, purchased together at a time when his daughter is 21 and living independently. She's not asking to take over the daughter's preexisting childhood room.", "Which is the reason why OP is YTA.  Instead of supporting her husband, who sounds like he's buying a house to accommodate OPs disability, she's making him decide between his wife and his daughter.  The husband clearly struggled with the separation and probably has some guilt about it.  Thanks to OP, the husband will have to sort out his own emotional and psychological problems.  Apparently all OP needs to be happy it's a guest room.", "1) I honestly don't think she'll want to. it's a 6 hour plane ride just to come pick out some furniture and paint. \n\n2) I have accessibility concerns for both my parents and my in laws. Beds can't be too high, no rugs, etc. I would listen to her input but she's a big maximalist and not too concerned if it's functional or not", "I think James should but I haven't because that feels like dragging her into an argument between us and that's not really sitting well with me", "I don't necessarily think his thinking is all that weird. I see this as him just wanting to make sure his daughter knows she'll always have a home with him, no matter what happens in her life.", "Its wrong because Jane has her own place to pick out as many duvet covers she wants.  If you think Jane should be allowed to decorate a room in someone else's home should Jane also foot the bill for the decor?", "Jane is a guest. It\u2019s not her home. Wow the loss on this is fucking incredible\u2026..", "As a 21 year old woman who has recently moved out of her parents home for real (meaning in my own apartment rather than on-campus housing that I could only stay in during the school year), you're being absurd. The only reason I still have a room at my parents home is because: I've only been moved out for about 5 months, my parents are busy and haven't had a chance to decide what to do with my room (much less actually do anything with it), and they are still considering moving (and why repurpose a room if you might move soon). I won't be hurt at all if and when my room gets repurposed. I fully expect that if they move I will not have my own room in the new house. I don't live there. Why would I need a room? That's dumb. They should use the room in a way that benefits them. \n\nYou say they're putting the daughter in the status of guest rather than daughter. Do your parents have a designated room in your home that is their room? If not, are you putting them in the status of guests rather than parents? They're family, not just guests, right? So by your logic, you need to have a room for them in your home or you're treating as if they're not a part of your family", "And you had to ask HER if SHE is the dense one?  Scroll through- you are actually the one who is not on the same page here.  Both Janes Bio Parents need to start treating her like the adult she is.  No wonder kids act so damn entitled lol", "Except she wouldn\u2019t be decorating her house she\u2019d be decorating her dad and stepmoms house. The daughter has her own place, not student housing. She is a grown woman", "~~This is the first im hearing about it being for an office. I could see why he would be mad if its there's not even going to be a guest bedroom. If 4 rooms are in the budget, you might want to at least consider it.~~\n\n~~I know most older couples living alone don't need that much space but the difference between 3 and 4 room cost is not typically that substantial. Most 3 beds already have two baths.~~\n\n~~Maybe this is unreasonable but that where my head went when I heard about this office.~~ \n\nIgnore this. I own up to my mistakes.", "OP isn't saying Jane isn't welcome, she's saying it's not really practical for her to have her own room when she's already an infrequent visitor to her father. If James needs a presence of Jane there's always things like photos on the wall and side tables.", "> Thanks to OP, the husband will have to sort out his own emotional and psychological problems.\n\nand this is a bad thing...why?", "lmfao you serious? OP is an asshole because an adult will have to manage his own adult emotions?", "Tell your husband you need a new pull-out sofa for HIS PARENTS to sleep on when they visit.  Maybe that will get his gears turning.\n\nI'm betting that neither he nor his daughter is going to spend a lot of time and effort on furnishing or decorating this room.  So let them take the lead, and possibly throw in a suggestion if things are going in the wrong direction.\n\nBut seriously I expect Jane will let you furnish it and you can pick a few personal items of hers or decorations she chooses and everyone will be happy.", "So consult her online, it's dead easy to give her a couple of choices of paint colour and ask if the bed you've picked out suits. So easy. It's a name, call it her room and let her know it will also be for guests too. Ffs our furnished basement is called grandma's room. \n\nYour replies definitely show you are making a stand here and it's not becoming. Work with your husband and his daughter here, they've known each other for 21 years.", "Meh, Jane's parents might simply have different values or cultures than the people here. Or even some leftover issues from the separation. Doesn't matter. The fact of the matter is, if Jane has her own room at one parent's but not the other, she'll be more likely to spend time at one house over the other. It can't be dismissed as a simple \"entitlement\" issue, especially since the argument was with the father, not Jane herself.", "i think it was sarcasm.", "Ever heard of a couch?", "What planet are you on? This is a grown adult woman living 6 hours away. It's ridiculous for OP to be expected to dedicate a room in her own house for this person. This is crazy talk.", "I find your comment unbecoming. OP is not taking a stand, just trying to be logical. They also own this house.\n\nI don't think it is appropriate or necessary for Jane to have a dedicated room in a house she no longer lives in - she lives 6 hours away for Christ's sake. I don't want my own room in my parents place. \n\nI think OPs husband is just having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that his baby girl is gone and will not be coming back. \n\nI think some gentle understanding and a bunch of direct communication could tease this out. NTA.", "Are you for real?", "Jane is an adult- having a room in a parents house shouldn't dictate her spending time with family.  It is entitlement 100%- everyone here expecting SM to maintain an UNUSED room in HER home is called entitlement.", "Lol.\n\n~~The big takeaway here is the fact that she is planning to turn it into her office but has mentioned this nowhere in the original post. This is a huge piece of contributing information that was just omitted.~~\n\nBig dyslexic train crash on my part. I kept forgetting about the 2nd room out of 3.", "Wow this has really hit a nerve hasn't it? I'm so sorry that I've upset you so much. \n\nDoes the young woman in question even know about this big argument? She may not even want a room decorated on her behalf. Just because it has an imaginary label of 'Xs room' doesn't mean it can't be used for other guests.", "And that's why I say it's NAH.  OP has married this guy, he has an adult daughter. Doesn't mean she is off his hands completely though. Dad may have his own issues detatching but OP can forge a loving connection with her stepdaughter. No need to alienate her for rhe cost of some paint and a duvet cover", "Look, it's clearly important to her father (and to her mother, since she has her own room there too). It doesn't matter what YOU think Jane should be doing, and really I see little indication in OP's post that even Jane wants it. The conflict is with the husband, and he thinks it's important that his DAUGHTER has a place at their new home. The stepmother trying to go against that is the problem, regardless of our own preference in this situation.", "Pull out couch in the office. Not a big stretch lol", "I think the downvotes show you've hit a nerve with more than just me. The \"young woman in question\" had no business knowing or inserting herself into the situation. I would never expect my parents to maintain a room for me after I've moved out. That's crazy talk.", "But OP is not alienating her step daughter? This is something the husband wants, not Jane. From OPs comments, it seems like Jane would be on a similar page to OP already", "So just to help you out here- this is SMS house just as much as Dads lol welcome to Reddit - it\u2019s about opinions and what people think. Jane us too old to have a room solely dedicated to her. \ud83d\ude44", "I was operating on only half my brain when I came to my non conclusion. Somehow 3 rooms in my head was only 2. Dyslexia is a thing. \n\nI still however do not understand how she would not be the asshole in a scenario where father and daughter always had plans for her to move back in after college. (Unverified despite asking).  People are quick to downvote on here.", "Yeah I agree- this is for Jane and OP to sort out together. That's why there are no assholes,", "It's THEIR house, but Jane is still HIS daughter, a bond OP should be mindful of.", "No, it's for OP and the husband to discuss. They both own the house, not Jane. \n\nJust not sure why you were putting the onus on OP to placate Jane when it is not even necessary, and saying their behaviour was 'not becoming'. There is nothing wrong with how OP has gone about this.", "So by \u201cmindful\u201d you mean give an adult that doesn\u2019t live there a designated room? Lol"]}
