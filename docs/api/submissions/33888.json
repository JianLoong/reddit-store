I just think you're taking it too far.\n\nI bet she won't forget again, after this, but you could bring something to eat just in case, and only pull it out if needed.

I'm not sure how it was an oversight in this scenario. \n\nAs a chef, she should know better than most how to practice safe food handling which includes proper preparation of meals for anyone with a food allergy. \n\nAt the end of the day your health comes first.

The fact that she let you go hungry suggests that there is more to this story, and I wouldn't blame you for not going back to her place. I find it interesting that your BF expects trouble as a result -- he knows something about her that you may not yet. \n\nAs a person with dietary restrictions, it is always a good idea to be packing an energy bar or two, or something that keeps well for such emergencies. But I can certainly see that in this case you didn't expect to need such a thing. \n\nThere's an underlying emotion current in your story. This is not just about the food. Why did you stay quiet?

However, she apologized and tried to rectify her mistake. It clearly wasn\u2019t an intentional oversight and she genuinely does feel bad about it. The only thing she could have done differently is offer to order take out for you, but that\u2019s sort of a moot point, since you rejected your bf\u2019s offer to order pizza.

Really think that one thru.", "NTA. This was intentional from the get-go. The selection of a seafood theme for a dinner party when she knows about your allergies was cruel.  She did not forget.

As well, she expressed regret and offered to make it up to you, thereby showing her contrition.

Yeah, many chefs are like this, they feel their \"art\" is above the needs of others, their allergies or even just their preferences; they would flat out refuse to deviate from their ideal course. \n\nSo, I personally doubt that was an \"oversight\".

Your hostess was very well aware that she was setting that up.\n\nSorry, but you have a BF problem.  He doesn't have your back ,he would rather placate his sister.  Think about whether this is OK with you.\n\nNTA.", "Question: Are.you saying all \"7 fishes\" were  shellfish?\n\nNot very imaginative for a chef then, and NTA if so.", "Nta she did this and she meant to do it. You reminded her and she ignored you. Your boyfriend is not being supportive of you and only thinking of his family.", "I think you have to decide if this is worth your relationship. If it was sincere, I think you need to let it go. Don\u2019t start trouble where there wasn\u2019t any- your boyfriend will resent you, his family will resent you and you will seem petty. If this happens repeatedly- yes absolutely then refuse to continue to go, but right now I think just keep your cool. My sister is allergic to shellfish and we do fish every Christmas Eve. Usually people with a shellfish allergy can eat fish just not shrimp, crab, etc. Maybe your bf\u2019s sister truly did think there would be more that you would be able to eat and it sounds like she really did feel bad. If it bothers you, have your boyfriend have a heart to heart with his sister and tell her that you offered to bring something because you were worried there wouldn\u2019t be anything else to eat- if nothing else, maybe it will help her be more understanding of someone bringing their own dish when they have an allergy.", "Is there something going on with you and this lady? The whole debacle definitely comes off as not entirely innocent, particularly since you brought up the specific issue ahead of time and offered to bring alternative food for yourself. The fact that out of 7 dishes, you could only have dip makes the chef seem suspect af.\n\nI think you might buy yourself more trouble than you\u2019re looking or by refusing to go to any future events based on this alone though. You guys are 25. If you stay together, you\u2019ll be dealing with a future SIL that you based the future decades off of one night and I can see that story making things uncomfortable for you. Even if you lay it all out, the reasonable reaction right now is probably going to sound like an overreaction after a significant amount of time has gone by. I think you\u2019d save yourself the grief if you attended the way people might attend a spouse\u2019s colleagues events or a date you\u2019re not feeling great about I.e. go into it with zero expectations of satisfaction and an exit plan. Attend either having eaten or with a backup meal. Discuss it with your partner and have an escape plan, either one that involves your partner or a good friend (much like the \u201ccall me with a family/medical emergency so I can escape a sketchy date\u201d scenario). Depending on how often you feel the backup/exit plans were actually needed, re-evaluate the situation and decide if your initial desire to cut these out of your life is still warranted and proceed accordingly.", "NTA but i would have ordered the pizza", "this isn't \"oversight\" this is a deliberate snub. nta. don't go back to another one of these parties", "NTA- you checked in with her regarding your allergies because the theme sounded like something that would not meet your dietary restrictions. This not an accident, or misunderstanding, that's on purpose. Especially since this is a common allergy, and a professional chef is trained on things like cross contamination and what specific ingredients are a danger for people with common allergies. (Plus shellfish allergies are pretty straightforward. Even an average home cook could've handled this one.) \n\nShe cared more about her theme than making sure all of her guests were fed and having a good time together. Honestly that's a little sad.", "NTA; she knew your allergy, checked with you, and said she\u2019s definitely have you covered when you offered to bring your own food so she wouldn\u2019t have to worry. And then didn\u2019t. In an extreme way. Every dish but one was off limits. I really do not see how that\u2019s an oversight. It feels intentional. The drama is very necessary.", "Honestly if I cooked and someone couldn\u2019t eat 99.99% of the food because I \u201cforgot\u201d to accommodate their known allergy I\u2019d have been mortified and ordered you pizza. Oversight my ass. You told her. She said she had you covered. What happened? Bf needs to work that out with his sister because she\u2019s the one causing drama with her \u201coversights\u201d not you. NTA", "NTA. You've attended enough parties she hosts for her to be well aware of your allergies. You even inquired what would be served and reminded her of your allergies.  In addition, you offered to bring dishes that you could eat so there would be no additional work at her end. She not only declined, saying specifically not to bring anything, but told you that she had you covered. \n\nAll guests are sitting at the table and you are the only one not eating?  How exactly did she not see this? How did no one else not notice you weren't eating?  Did no one ask why you aren't eating anything? Are you eating in a different room by yourself? \n\nYour bf sister did not care even a little. There's absolutely no excuse she can give.  Plus if your bf thought of ordering pizza , his sister should have thought of that herself.\n\nNo one else at the dinner seemed to care either.  And if they were your bf's family members, cousins,  etc. this is worse. This situation told you exactly who they are and what they think of you. \n\nWhy didn't your bf stand up for you?  Its his family,  he should have dealt with this.\n\nYour bf is right about one thing - avoiding his sister will cause family drama.  And your bf does not want to deal with that. He wants you to ignore and forgive everything so he doesn't have to deal with anything.  He rather you be miserable so his family is happy.\n\nFace it.  She deliberately made sure there was nothing for you to eat.\n\nShe only apologized on the way out and in front of her brother so she could say \"but i said i was sorry\". Offering to cook you a special dinner was only to make herself look good in front of her brother your bf. She was relieved when you said no thank you. \n\nThis will happen again because had she truly felt apologic she'd have made something quickly for you (even if just a sandwich),  order pizza delivery,  or ordered from Grubhub. Instead she watched you go hungry, starve.\n\nIt appears your bf sees nothing wrong with the way she treated you. Interesting he insists you go to future events and is so sure it won't happen again when he don't believe that. \n\nCall your bf out. You'll go (always take your car) and agree to leave together if necessary.  If she again serves you nothing you can eat you can leave at any time, with out without your bf.", "NTA the real problem here is bf doesn't care atall that you were very clearly snubbed and excluded", "So many questions:\n\n1) how long have you two been together?\n\n2) You don't say this has happened before, so why do you not feel it was a genuine oversight? Has something happened between you two before this?\n\n3) Can you not reach out to SiL in private and have the conversation? you don't need to be rude or cold or anything. You can just say I was disappointed because you always make the most amazing dishes and I know that my allergy creates more work for you, but that is why I appreciate you more, for going that extra mile. I was sad to see everyone enjoying your lovely meal and I couldn't join in, is all. Is there anything we can do together, to make the next event more enjoyable for everyone?", "ESH...\n\nYes, she really disrespected you, it was unacceptable...\n\nBut unless you've been disrespected in other ways, this appears to be a one-off... if so, you need to try to let it go... I mean, you're only 25, are you going to hold this grudge for the rest of your lives? That'll be dozens of events, for decades to come, that you'll create drama at...\n\nHusband is right, you really need to let this go... you should accept the dinner offer to make it up to you...", "NTA. Firstly, she chose the theme knowing about your allergy. Secondly, you reminded her. Thirdly, you offered to bring something and she refused and told you you were covered.\n\nBut this is the nail in the coffin for me. Imagine what a truly great chef would do with a \"seven fishes\" theme and a shellfish allergy. What would Anthony Bourdain have done? Mario Batali? Alain Ducasse? Julia Child? Heston Blumenthal?\n\nGordon Ramsay would have thrown that wench out of her own kitchen with a barrage of f-bombs for what she did, and then made an amazing feast from her leftover ingredients that every single person invited could eat. \n\nYou say bf's sister is an amazing chef. She's really not. She sorely lacks professionalism, attention to detail, planning ability, communication, creativity, generosity, improvisation. She let a diner at her table go hungry and made no attempt to rectify it. That is not a great chef, or even a mediocre one. That is a bad, bad, bad chef.\n\nWhat she did was 10000% on purpose to exclude you. There is no other explanation.", ">BF did at one point offer to order pizza delivery, which I declined because it felt rude to his sister and honestly a bit embarrassing for me.\n\n\"Check with your sister. I offered to bring food for myself but she didn't want me to bring \"off-theme\" food so was going to take care of it. Pizza would be too off-theme. Of the seven fishes, I mean. It would be on the theme of everyone being able to enjoy food together as a family.\"\n\nThis was intentional. And your boyfriend continuing to feast is upsetting, too, to be honest.\n\nYWNBTA", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't an oversight. This was deliberate. It was also at a major family holiday dinner, the sort you don't generally refuse (if you're looking to avoid that \"unnecessary drama\" your bf is worried about), so it was extra shitty of your bf's sister to do this at a family event you would feel obligated to attend. Family should have been the hosts first priority, not her theme.\n\nI don't understand why your bf is upset with you for \"unnecessary drama\". His sister is the source of the drama; she hosted an event that specifically excluded one of the guests. She's a terrible host and definitely not good at dinner parties. The entire point of the party is the guests should feel wanted, not for the host to show off past the point of basic manners.", "\"She knows about my allergy and I know it\u2019s not the easiest theme to work around that, so I asked what I could do to help or if I could just bring a few dishes I can definitely eat. She said all was handled, please don\u2019t bring off-theme dishes\"", "Scandinavian here. Bread stuffed with fish? The only thing i can think of is fish on top of bread. Though, norwegian Gravlaks is god tier fucking delicious with a mustard sauce on.", "She specifically said Don't bring anything because she didn't want to ruin the theme. It was definitely intentional, her aesthetic was more important than her guests.", "Right? Seems like a weird over reaction if its a one off...\n\nI can appreciate being this pissed in the moment... but gotta calm down and let it go...", "Biologist here... It's pretty common to be allergic to shellfish and not fin fish because shellfish are so distantly related to fin fish.\n\nIt's like being allergic to peanuts (a legume related to beans) but not almonds (seeds of a tree fruit related to peaches).\n\n Fish, sharks, eels, etc. are vertebrates. \n\n \"Shellfish\" are marine/aquatic invertebrates, mostly arthropods (shrimp, lobster, crayfish etc ) , molluscs (clams, oysters, etc.), and cephalopods (octopus, squid, etc ). They're much older branches on the tree of life than vertebrate fish. \n\nFrom what I know of the Feast of the Seven Fishes, there's no reason not to have at least one course that's only fin fish. It's not like she made Chinese or Southeast Asian food where all the sauces included oyster sauce or shrimp paste, and she wasn't sure if the \"anchovy based fish sauce\" wasn't contaminated by shrimp at the factory. \n\nA professional chef can avoid cross contamination and make a separate course for a guest with an allergy. Being off theme shouldn't be as offensive as leaving someone hungry.", "It wasn't an accident, it was selfish. The OP even tried to discuss it with her ahead of time.\n\n\"She knows about my allergy and I know it\u2019s not the easiest theme to work around that, so I asked what I could do to help or if I could just bring a few dishes I can definitely eat. She said all was handled, please don\u2019t bring off-theme dishes,\"", "Good solution here...", "I don't believe the apology was sincere. It happened only at the end of the event when they were leaving. The sister could have apologised in the beginning, offered to make or order something so the op would be included, instead of sitting there hungry for a couple of hours. I think the sis thought if she didn't acknowledge the issue, no one would say anything and her \"perfect dinner host\" image would be maintained. An apology at the end and the offer/opportunity to host/show off to op at a later date is having her cake and eating it too", "I know someone pre-med or whatever you call it, just before they come a Dr, that constantly hosts extremely elaborate trivia nights and things. You can be successful and good at your job and make time for other things. Not sure if that\u2019s the point to make", "Hard disagree. OP declined the offer to order a pizza because she didn\u2019t want to draw extra attention and embarrass herself further. That\u2019s not even a little bit the same as BF\u2019s sister refusing to provide OP with a suitable meal, considering she knew of OP\u2019s allergy. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s provided meals she could eat in the past, because she didn\u2019t do it this time.\n\nAlso your last sentence makes no sense. Of course OP would be extra annoyed that this happened at Christmas (anyone would), but that doesn\u2019t invalidate any frustration at this clear disrespect. And again, just because the sister has actually provided for all of her guests in the past (aka the bare minimum for the host of a dinner party), that doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that she blatantly refused to do so this time.\n\nBF\u2019s sister is clearly more concerned with making these events about her \u201ctheme\u201d than the people she\u2019s supposed to be feeding. NTA", ">due to her massive eff-up\n\nShe didn't f-up. It was intentional. The fact that she wouldn't even let them bring their own food proves that.", "This...\n\nIf this was a one-off, accept the dinner offer to make it up to you and move on...\n\nElse, ESH...", "SIL didn\u2019t want off-theme food on the table so let OP starve. There\u2019s no way that was an accident, especially since she specifically forbade OP from bringing \u2018off-theme food\u2019. SIL seems controlling & smug, I could never trust her again. OP is BTA but her SIL is a huge one.", "\"Oh no. I made a mistake and added something that will kill you to every dish. Also I said under no circumstances bring your own food because it will ruin my theme. So starve for the next 6 courses. Order you food you can eat to apologise? Create something you can eat and serve that so you don't starve? Why would I do that? I'll just say sorry at the end.\" \n\nShe made the mistake of adding an allergen to everything, and then made 6 mistakes by not caring for every course past the dip. \n\nAlso. It's a feast of the fishes. Shellfish are closer to snails than fish. Why was there shellfish in everything?", "Maybe they mean the meat pastries with a ground meat and rice filling, \"lihapiirakka\", and made into a fish shape?

They are indeed Finnish. Looks delicious. Thank you for mentioning it!", "No problem! And nicely recognized, I'm a Finn myself so those two came to mind. Never tried kalakukko myself but there's even a song called Lent\u00e4v\u00e4 Kalakukko (freely translated as \"flying fish rooster\", altho the kukko in the bread has nothing to do with roosters lol)", "Listen you dont know what happened. She very well could have intended to make more dishes op could have eaten, and then just forgot in the chaos of planning a large themed meal. I think thats very likely what happened.
