I just think you're taking it too far.\n\nI bet she won't forget again, after this, but you could bring something to eat just in case, and only pull it out if needed. She certainly doesn't have a leg to stand on at this point to not \"allow\" you to bring something you can eat.\n\nI guess it depends on whether you think it could get serious with BF. If not, then go ahead and skip her fantastic dinners - you'd only be hurting yourself, and possibly hastening your breakup with BF. \n\nBut if she might become your SIL, then maybe don't draw that line in the sand.

From the sound of it you've attended enough of your boyfriend's sister's dinners for her to know about your food allergy and also for her to know with certainty that her brother's girlfriend with health related dietary restrictions would be in attendance. I'm not sure how it was an oversight in this scenario. \n\nAs a chef, she should know better than most how to practice safe food handling which includes proper preparation of meals for anyone with a food allergy. \n\nAt the end of the day your health comes first. If you don't want to attend her dinners anymore because you've lost confidence in her ability to prepare meals that will be safe for you to consume then I think that's fair and reasonable.", "She may have forgotten, so perhaps you should give her another chance, especially if she is fantastic a cook as you say she is.

Especially after you had asked about bringing something for yourself beforehand. There can be no excuse whatsoever for her -- any kitchen can produce an omelet or a sandwich! The fact that she let you go hungry suggests that there is more to this story, and I wouldn't blame you for not going back to her place. I find it interesting that your BF expects trouble as a result -- he knows something about her that you may not yet. \n\nAs a person with dietary restrictions, it is always a good idea to be packing an energy bar or two, or something that keeps well for such emergencies. But I can certainly see that in this case you didn't expect to need such a thing. \n\nThere's an underlying emotion current in your story. This is not just about the food. Why did you stay quiet? Why did she not feed you something, anything? Why is your BF anxious about upsetting her? Are there racial/bigot vibes here? Whatever it is, NTA.", "NTA.

It's quite possible that she thought you could eat more of the dishes than you actually could. She's the AH for not providing more options for you.\n\nAs such, I'd take her apology as sincere. If she does it AGAIN, then I'd consider her the only AH.

No problem, just pop in some microwave popcorn.  Then accidentally burn it for some extra petty stinkiness.", "INFO: have there been any other issues with SIL?

And if something like this happens again I would certainly order food for yourself and then tell your boyfriend no mas in the future.", "ESH. She screwed up big time. However, she apologized and tried to rectify her mistake. It clearly wasn\u2019t an intentional oversight and she genuinely does feel bad about it. The only thing she could have done differently is offer to order take out for you, but that\u2019s sort of a moot point, since you rejected your bf\u2019s offer to order pizza. At this point her only crime is not being perfect. You\u2019re not perfect either.

You have a serious allergy. Your sil being a chef is capable and encounters this daily, it\u2019s not some foreign concept to her.

But if it happens a second time, then I would stop going.", "NTA - BF's sister is the one who's being inflexible (not making food you can eat and not letting you bring food you can eat) and she's the one who caused unnecessary drama in her own family - and she just is testing to see what you will put up with.  \n\nThe fact that she did this to you - and he's pissed at you - would have me gently suggest that you might want to really question whether your boyfriend cares about you and respects you - if he thinks any of this is acceptable - and that the only recourse is for you to \"suck it up when treated like crap.\"  Please.  Really think that one thru.", "NTA. This was intentional from the get-go. The selection of a seafood theme for a dinner party when she knows about your allergies was cruel.  She did not forget.  It is not possible for someone who's that focused on the details of her events to forget such critical information.\n\nWhat else is going on here?  There is a backstory.", "INFO:  \nAbout your allergy - are you allergic to all kind of fish or just the shellfish?   \n\n\nIf you can eat fish, she could easily make a dish or two for everybody, which you also could eat. A salmon baked in pastry, fish soup, fish burgers - whatever.", "YTA. Yes you were 'disrespected', but it was one event over a course of several, and its your partner's sister, not some rando.  As well, she expressed regret and offered to make it up to you, thereby showing her contrition. You have not written anything to make us think she has a dislike for you, or that shows a pattern of 'disrespecting you'. You are indeed introducing unnecessary drama into your boyfriend's life, and putting him in a situation where he has to choose you or his sister. Because of one event.\n\nGive her a chance to demonstrate her regret, before making so drastic a decision.", "NTA\nYou reminded her multiple times, asked if you could help or bring your own food \nand she vetoed: god forbid you deviate from the theme I guess?

Ugh", "YTA. You said yourself she usually has plenty of options. The one time she doesnt (and also apologized) you gonna be like that.

That's not an oversight, that's intentional.", "Agreed", "You can have a seafood themed dinner without shellfish. She was told and assured op it was taken care of.  How could she have forgotten that?

Can\u2019t imagine treating someone like that.", "\"Please don't bring food that's not in theme\"\n\nTbh the conversation about the allergies happened before the event.

For her to just let you watch everyone else eat and just apologize.....my midwestern manners are in shock", "Question: did she only serve fish or did she prepare something other than fish, but you didn\u2019t eat it because of some other concern, like cross contamination? The reason I ask is because sometimes hosts will prepare alternative meals for guests with dietary restrictions, but they don\u2019t prepare them properly and the guest ends up not eating it. I\u2019m just trying to figure out exactly what she did.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Got a point. Definitely a little ehs but i still think op is being extreme in not going back. From what i read host seems like a pretty dang generous and accomidating person most of the time. She had one bad night. Which, again, she apologized for. Even offered to make it up to them.

Give me a fucking break with that excuse dude.", "Because op's allergies were incovenient to her theme. The apology and atonement can be summarized with, \"it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission\". Much easier to say \"ooops, sworrry! Totes forgot!

SIL said I got you. She didn't want anyone going off theme. She knew she didn't have her when she said that.  She knew what she was making.  It wasn't an oversight.", "[deleted]", "You\u2019re right, by being informed of an allergy and telling the gf not to bring food because her allergy is covered and then actually not is a total complete unforeseen oversight.
