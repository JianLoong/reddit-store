It's the thought that counts, but his effort wasn't good enough.\n\nBy saying that you want something from the store _instead_, though, you are sending the wrong messages: one, that his efforts are futile, and he should just give up, and two, that you only value the product and not the thought.\n\nWhat you ought to say is that you appreciate the attempt, but  you can't wear it, unfortunately. Don't ask for a different gift as a substitute. Just accept that this gift didn't go according to plan, and maybe the next one will turn out better, whether he makes another homemade attempt and perhaps improves with experience, or he realizes he's not cut out for jewelry making and takes your advice. Or, if he's willing, see if he thinks he can fix the issues with this current gift. It's okay to criticize his skills, but don't give up on him. That's very demoralizing.", "INFO: Can we get a pic of the bracelet? I feel like going NTA but a pic can make it much easier to judge.", "Nta/info. Gauging by your response and his, I'm gathering you're not a family who does homemade gifts as a habit, and I imagine if he asked for a new chair/game/shirt/watch/ring, you wouldn't expect to make it and have him cheer, right? Also, you're not particularly broke as a couple right now either, right? \n\nThe fact that you mention he's never done this before, nor took a class or learned this before, plus the jagged pieces that would cut you? Now, curiosity also makes me ask- if you were to put on (with a long glove or sleeve I guess?) that bracelet and wear it around his family/peers/friends, would he be proud of that gift? You mention he said it's about the effort, so not sure how much effort this shows, but perhaps this is a larger question- is he usually one who shows effort for you? Who cares about what you value or want as gifts or even in everyday?", "I need a pic to judge", "NAH, I absolutely understand the thought and effort behind hand made gifts but there is a bar you have to hit, and that\u2019s \u2018safe to be used\u2019. \n\nIf he instead got into glass cutting and made her a cup by cutting the top off a nice wine bottle (I\u2019ve seen this as a hobby people sometimes get into) there is still an expectation that he has to sand it down to make it safe to be used, because risking injury every time you use someone\u2019s gift is just not the point of the gift.

As a creative person, I can tell you that making something which is sneered at is taken more to heart than a rejected bought item.

Hours of research, buying materials, frustration, YouTube videos, and probably several moments where he thought about giving up but kept going to give her something straight from his heart and hands... only yo have it shit on.\n\nYes it sucks royally that it's unwearable... but like... there are SO much worse things. This just seems so trivial when all you had to do was love your partner for thinking enough of you to be vulnerable in a way most men wouldn't dream of being.\n\nIdk. In a country where people get divorced like they wash their hands I think it's way more important for couples to try new things, be romantic, be supportive, love each other, show genuine effort. I can order my own jewelry. \n\nThis post and these comments just made me really depressed and if I was OPs husband I'd be crushed because I know how much of myself I'd have put into that probably shitty piece and how much all I'd want is for a kiss on the forhead like my mom gave my bad after that terrible mug...", "ESH - Him for gifting an unfinished piece that needs work to be functional.\n\nYou for not encouraging him to finish it or keep trying, but instead telling him to just buy your jewelry at a store.

And it is understandable that he was hurt as you were unappreciative of his efforts. You both need to find a way to set aside you hurt and discuss what you're perspective of events was. Perhaps consider Couples counseling to discuss the issue and see if you can come to a compromise.

For Valentine's one year, he made me a box of chocolates.  Went to the craft store and bought molds, bought some (pretty cheap) grocery store chocolate, and stayed up for hours melting chocolate and pouring it in the molds, wrapping it in paper and boxing it.  I was so disappointed and unhappy with the misshapen, almost tasteless candy he got me.  I thought a cheap box of Russell Stover would have cost the same and tasted better and he knew I was disappointed.  \n\n\nNow, 43 years into our marriage, he buys me four or five boxes of the most expensive chocolate  you can get...he really does it up on Valentine's.  And it takes effort and love, no doubt, to go to all the different stores and pick out the cholocates I'd like, but honestly...I look back at our youth together and would absolutely adore it if he made me a box of crappy chocolate one year.

SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HANDMADE GIFTS AND THAT'S OK! It's up to the gift giver to know the recipient well enough to know if they would even like the gift. And if it's a new experience for both the giver and recipient, then the giver needs to understand that the gift may not be liked or appreciated in the way they want.

It doesn't have to cost anything, but it also doesn't have to be expensive.   Stop projecting with that gold-digger nonsense.   You can buy demi-fine jewelry for under $100.  At least, it wouldn't warrant a tetanus booster.", "It's not a gift for *him* though, is it? It was supposed to be a gift for his wife. Something she would like, to celebrate her existence on her birthday. He gave her something useless and painful, and expected gratitude. He is a selfish immature excuse for a husband, and I suspect all the men defending him want A plus credit for D minus effort.", "There's a lot of ungracious gift getters in this thread. I can understand being disappointed in the gift but everyone advising to absolutely tear into this guy seems so off base. \n\nWho's to say if he had gone to a jewelry store the gift would have even been something OP liked? There's a lot of tacky jewelry out there and I'd rather be disappointed in a handmade gift than take a chance on getting some heart shaped monstrosity that cost 10x more. \n\nBottom line? You want nice jewelry, get it for yourself.", "What gifts?? This is something that he made her, who would actually hurt her if she wears it. It would've been better if he drew her a picture. Still a lousy non gift, but at least wouldn't damage her health.", "Everyone is entitled to not be in physical harm for no reason, lmao.", "I mean honestly we are truly asking for bare minimum. I mean bar is on the ground bare minimum for a 5 year old.", "In the case of the dancing story, unless there's something specific he wants to see in his wife's dancing, no feedback is necessary. She's taking classes. While what she's doing is not great, the problems in her dance will sort themselves out as she continues to practice, and the feedback is honestly better delivered from her dance instructor rather than her husband.\n\nNot to mention, OP didn't actually give any feedback to her husband. He could just tell by her face that she wasn't as excited about the present as he thought she'd be.", "I don't think the judgement would be any different if a woman made something for her husband that would hurt him.\n\nThere's a world of difference between \"swallow feeling awkward so your partner can practice their craft without feeling bad\" and \"let yourself be injured so your partner can practice their craft without feeling bad\".\n\nIf the jewellery was just kinda ugly, I'd say she's TA, but the fact that its *actively harmful* really changes the situation.", "I'm sorry but if I gift someone something I made myself I make damn sure it's as nice as I can probably can make it. This sounds more like he worked on it a bit then looked at it and said 'good enough' without even checking himself. If it is as bad as she described it these are issues he should've seen.", "I bought a solid silver ring for \u00a320, you don't even have to come close to $100", "Subjectively terrible. Let's not be overly dramatic.", ">I suspect all the men defending him want A plus credit for D minus effort.\n\nAnd I suspect all the women that critisizing him is a gold digger.", "Right? I don't know how saying \"I can't wear this unless you fix it because it causes physical harm\" is being too negative. That's the absolute minimum requirement for being able to wear jewelry. If she can't wear it, then it's a useless bracelet.", "I got so mad and then realized you were making a joke about how it\u2019s ten.", "I would agree if people actually cared about the hurting part . People aren\u2019t concerned about that section of it . If this was just bad made jewellery the sentiment would still be the same in this sub", "Jewellery that will injure you if you wear it is not subjectively terrible.", "Op said it's so poorly finished it would cut her if she wore it. That's objectively terrible.", "A gold digger for expecting a functional gift on their birthday that looks nice and doesn't cut their skin?", "There's way too much discussion on this jagged piece as if it were an attempt at murder.  How bad could it really be?"]}
