It's the thought that counts, but his effort wasn't good enough.\n\nBy saying that you want something from the store _instead_, though, you are sending the wrong messages: one, that his efforts are futile, and he should just give up, and two, that you only value the product and not the thought.\n\nWhat you ought to say is that you appreciate the attempt, but  you can't wear it, unfortunately. Don't ask for a different gift as a substitute. Just accept that this gift didn't go according to plan, and maybe the next one will turn out better, whether he makes another homemade attempt and perhaps improves with experience, or he realizes he's not cut out for jewelry making and takes your advice. Or, if he's willing, see if he thinks he can fix the issues with this current gift. It's okay to criticize his skills, but don't give up on him. That's very demoralizing.", "INFO: Can we get a pic of the bracelet? I feel like going NTA but a pic can make it much easier to judge.", "Nta/info. Gauging by your response and his, I'm gathering you're not a family who does homemade gifts as a habit, and I imagine if he asked for a new chair/game/shirt/watch/ring, you wouldn't expect to make it and have him cheer, right? Also, you're not particularly broke as a couple right now either, right? \n\nThe fact that you mention he's never done this before, nor took a class or learned this before, plus the jagged pieces that would cut you? Now, curiosity also makes me ask- if you were to put on (with a long glove or sleeve I guess?) that bracelet and wear it around his family/peers/friends, would he be proud of that gift? You mention he said it's about the effort, so not sure how much effort this shows, but perhaps this is a larger question- is he usually one who shows effort for you? Who cares about what you value or want as gifts or even in everyday?", "I need a pic to judge", "NAH, I absolutely understand the thought and effort behind hand made gifts but there is a bar you have to hit, and that\u2019s \u2018safe to be used\u2019. \n\nIf he instead got into glass cutting and made her a cup by cutting the top off a nice wine bottle (I\u2019ve seen this as a hobby people sometimes get into) there is still an expectation that he has to sand it down to make it safe to be used, because risking injury every time you use someone\u2019s gift is just not the point of the gift.

Hours of research, buying materials, frustration, YouTube videos, and probably several moments where he thought about giving up but kept going to give her something straight from his heart and hands... only yo have it shit on.\n\nYes it sucks royally that it's unwearable... but like... there are SO much worse things. This just seems so trivial when all you had to do was love your partner for thinking enough of you to be vulnerable in a way most men wouldn't dream of being.\n\nIdk. In a country where people get divorced like they wash their hands I think it's way more important for couples to try new things, be romantic, be supportive, love each other, show genuine effort. I can order my own jewelry. \n\nThis post and these comments just made me really depressed and if I was OPs husband I'd be crushed because I know how much of myself I'd have put into that probably shitty piece and how much all I'd want is for a kiss on the forhead like my mom gave my bad after that terrible mug...", "ESH - Him for gifting an unfinished piece that needs work to be functional.\n\nYou for not encouraging him to finish it or keep trying, but instead telling him to just buy your jewelry at a store.

And it is understandable that he was hurt as you were unappreciative of his efforts. You both need to find a way to set aside you hurt and discuss what you're perspective of events was. Perhaps consider Couples counseling to discuss the issue and see if you can come to a compromise.

For Valentine's one year, he made me a box of chocolates.  Went to the craft store and bought molds, bought some (pretty cheap) grocery store chocolate, and stayed up for hours melting chocolate and pouring it in the molds, wrapping it in paper and boxing it.  I was so disappointed and unhappy with the misshapen, almost tasteless candy he got me.  I thought a cheap box of Russell Stover would have cost the same and tasted better and he knew I was disappointed.  \n\n\nNow, 43 years into our marriage, he buys me four or five boxes of the most expensive chocolate  you can get...he really does it up on Valentine's.  And it takes effort and love, no doubt, to go to all the different stores and pick out the cholocates I'd like, but honestly...I look back at our youth together and would absolutely adore it if he made me a box of crappy chocolate one year.

SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HANDMADE GIFTS AND THAT'S OK! It's up to the gift giver to know the recipient well enough to know if they would even like the gift. And if it's a new experience for both the giver and recipient, then the giver needs to understand that the gift may not be liked or appreciated in the way they want.

This is the first piece I made and I want you to have it.\"", "We shouldn\u2019t stop encouraging people\u2019s artistic endeavors but there\u2019s a difference between \u201cI\u2019m happy you enjoy this and would love to hear about it and look at your work\u201d, and \u201cyes please continue to give your low quality attempts to me as gifts\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s the part where it\u2019s a birthday gift that makes the husband an AH. He\u2019s putting OP in the awkward position of having to support and try to do something with a poor piece of work which is meant to be FOR HER. If it was just a spur of the moment gift and didn\u2019t happen all the time then I\u2019d agree that OP should be kinder and offer to support as he polishes his craft - but on this occasion he\u2019s used the occasion of her birthday to force her to be a part of HIS hobby. At the very least he should get her jewelry from the store, which she wants, and also something he made.", "No? It\u2019s called being a decent human being? It\u2019s called having empathy and not acting entitled? It\u2019s called appreciating the incredibly nice gesture of hand making a piece for their loved one?", "As a nosy human being, I would like to know what it looks like", "It's more like gifting your mom a bunch of pralines for her birthday when she's allergic to nuts.", "I made a bracelet, look at it glisten!\n\nDoesn't matter if it breaks your skin,\n\nGratitude is what you should bring in.\n\nWait, you mean store-bought is fine?\n\nI tried really hard, now you'll hear me whine.\n\nYikes yikes, baby", "Not objective enough. We have 1 person saying it's great and we have 1 person saying she hates it.", "Until changes were made to the post, it sounded like the problem OP had was that it wasn't an expensive piece of jewelry.   We have no idea if they told their partner the first statement they told us (which would be terribly crushing) or if they pointed to real things that cause issues (which were not mentioned to us until we asked for clarification, so don't actually seem like the real reason OP doesn't like the bracelet.... why would \"I can't wear it without pain\" be an afterthought if OP would accept a beautiful, non-painful homemade bracelet?  It wouldn't be.  It would be the only issue.", "If you dont get why this sucks for her. Then it isnt worth the time attempting to explain it to you.", "Right? i Guess I read OP\u2019s post differently. To me, it sounded like the husband mentioned jewelry beforehand because he was excited about trying to make something special for her. It sounded like he was upset that he\u2019d put real effort into her gift, and she said effort doesn\u2019t matter because it was messed up in some areas. I said NAH because I could also absolutely understand why she could be upset that his gift wasn\u2019t what she was hoping it would be. I personally don\u2019t like to hurt the folks I love, so said I\u2019d recommend trying to spare his feelings in the future, and folks were Uber pissed about that, like trying not to hurt our loved ones is a bad thing. I dunno? I was raised that you didn\u2019t expect gifts, and if you were given one, you thanked the giver - gifts were just that, a gift, not something I was entitled to. If you didn\u2019t like the gift, you let the giver down gently, and let them know that you still appreciated and loved them for trying. My hubby is the same I guess. Some gifts we\u2019ve given have been great, others less so, but we\u2019ve always been thankful. We\u2019ve been together for decades, so I guess that\u2019s working for us. Different strokes for different folks. I also couldn\u2019t understand why folks were making it out like he\u2019d given her a live grenade. In any case, I hope that OP and her hubby are able to work it out and wish them the best.", "Genuinely people here are extremely entitled. They lose nothing from having a gift they don\u2019t like, yet they act like it\u2019s the end of the world. They\u2019re acting like he was trying to fucking murder her with the bracelet. They have absolutely zero empathy, they\u2019re acting like being a decent human means you\u2019re coddling the other person like they are a child.", "As an autistic demigirl, I three wanna know what it looks like.", "xD love it", "Then it's not silver. Or it's super thin.", "Nothing someone makes for others to appreciate is objectively terrible, that\u2019s just the definition of objective. It is strongly subjectively terrible though lol.\n\nReally though not to be a pedantic ass but i would still love a piece of jewelry made by my SO. Hell my ex wife\u2019s dad made our rings (out of a really nice polished wood with gold inset) and mine was the totally wrong size. So i just took it and made a necklace of it!\n\nI guess all i\u2019m getting at is despite this gift being terrible artwork that may injure you if used properly you can totally appreciate him trying and failing horribly while he obviously thought he succeeded. I do think she should have handled it differently. I would have been like \u201clol dude, this is cutting into my wrist you silly man. Very sweet of you to get me a gift though!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s just something off to me about a grown adult opening a gift that no one is required to give you and being sour about it. Man, i just appreciate my SO existe and is a wonderful and sweet woman. That\u2019s enough for me on any holiday, so oftentimes we just don\u2019t do gifts (but sometimes we do and it\u2019s nice :)", "Well, he's her husband. He actually IS required to give her a gift. And she IS allowed to be sour about it because he's an adult and not a 3 years old."]}
