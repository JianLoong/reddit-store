Yes, they made it for you but it got a hole in it you can't use it. The effort is nice but if you can't use it what's the point? It is more of a look I tried than a real gift.\n\nNAH", "Can you take it to a jewellery shop and get it touched up. \n\nOr\n\nTell him about the jagged edges/ polishing Ona constructive way for him to fix", "INFO: did he put real thought, time and effort into handcrafting the jewelry or does it seem like he just slapped something together to save money?", "NTA\n\nHe should have finished it properly instead of giving you something that is going to catch on your clothes and potentially cut you! \n\nThere\u2019s grace in gift receiving but there\u2019s also grace in gift giving.

You don\u2019t need to praise him for a piece of trash he made, or thank him for the dead mouse he left.

It's the thought that counts, but his effort wasn't good enough.\n\nBy saying that you want something from the store _instead_, though, you are sending the wrong messages: one, that his efforts are futile, and he should just give up, and two, that you only value the product and not the thought.\n\nWhat you ought to say is that you appreciate the attempt, but  you can't wear it, unfortunately. Don't ask for a different gift as a substitute. Just accept that this gift didn't go according to plan, and maybe the next one will turn out better, whether he makes another homemade attempt and perhaps improves with experience, or he realizes he's not cut out for jewelry making and takes your advice. Or, if he's willing, see if he thinks he can fix the issues with this current gift. It's okay to criticize his skills, but don't give up on him. That's very demoralizing.", "INFO: Can we get a pic of the bracelet? I feel like going NTA but a pic can make it much easier to judge.", "Nta/info. Gauging by your response and his, I'm gathering you're not a family who does homemade gifts as a habit, and I imagine if he asked for a new chair/game/shirt/watch/ring, you wouldn't expect to make it and have him cheer, right? Also, you're not particularly broke as a couple right now either, right? \n\nThe fact that you mention he's never done this before, nor took a class or learned this before, plus the jagged pieces that would cut you? Now, curiosity also makes me ask- if you were to put on (with a long glove or sleeve I guess?) that bracelet and wear it around his family/peers/friends, would he be proud of that gift? You mention he said it's about the effort, so not sure how much effort this shows, but perhaps this is a larger question- is he usually one who shows effort for you? Who cares about what you value or want as gifts or even in everyday?", "I need a pic to judge", "NAH, I absolutely understand the thought and effort behind hand made gifts but there is a bar you have to hit, and that\u2019s \u2018safe to be used\u2019. \n\nIf he instead got into glass cutting and made her a cup by cutting the top off a nice wine bottle (I\u2019ve seen this as a hobby people sometimes get into) there is still an expectation that he has to sand it down to make it safe to be used, because risking injury every time you use someone\u2019s gift is just not the point of the gift. People don\u2019t generally want you to get hurt using their gift, cuz then everyone feels bad.", "Make him a piece of clothing-very badly- and tell him it's the effort that counts.

You, however, are just a materialistic asshole.", "[deleted]", "Soft YTA- Why not just thank him for the gift and gently bring up your concerns so he can fix it. He probably wouldnt mind sanding the rough edges and evening out the polish. Sounds like he worked hard to make the bracelet just for you", "YTA. What he gave you had every moment of his love for you embedded in it, from just thinking about it, to planning it, to making it, and to giving it to you as an expression of his love. You could have graciously accepted it, and later asked him to modify it if it really was painful to wear.", "ESH, I guess. Him for giving you a hazardous bracelet, you for saying something from the store would be better. Something from him would be better *if* he executed it correctly. Can he polish this same item until it's safe?", "No you are def the A hole.

Because that's what you do when someone gives you a gift.", "Find a jewellery making course nearby, buy him a session/course for Christmas,  bday, anniversary,  whatever. \n\nSoft Yta, because your question doesn't specify a badly made handmade piece, which just makes me feel that even if it was perfect you still wouldn't like it. As a creative person, I can tell you that making something which is sneered at is taken more to heart than a rejected bought item. He obviously put a lot of thought into it, get him a course/kit to encourage that.", "YTA\n\nYou could ask him to smooth it or something, but come on, a cool handmade bracelet? It's an awesome gift.", "He went out of his way to make you something and you behave like a spoiled child ....wtf if wrong with you? \n\nYou can say that you like better the ones in a shop , after a few days , but dont have to diminish such a big effort to get you something . \n\nI can promise you everyone will say you are the AH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Fundamentally he gifted you something you did not want and had none of your wants or needs considered in it. It's irrelevant how poorly made it was, when from the start it was gift that did not center YOU, the recipient, at the core of the thoughtfulness or specifics of the gift.

One day you will likely have children coming home from school with a beautiful painting they made just for you.
