And also people like her fianc\u00e9 and his family can go take a big old flying f*** to themselves.", "NTA maybe Cassie shousn't be marrying a homophobe", "No. No no no no no. \n\nNTA. \n\nJust no.", "Yuck. Cassie clearly rather support and get money from homophobes.", "NTA and i think it's important that you stick to your gut and don't go. This is an adult woman who was loved and cared for her whole life by you and now is expecting you to hide so she can marry an AH", "The most galling part of this is that Sean\u2019s parents don\u2019t want this blah blah, they\u2019re basically the same age as you (give or take). Would you accept anyone else in your same age bracket treating you like this?! No you\u2019d tell them to fuck off their tiny minds to Bigotsville.  It\u2019s some patronising condescending controlling shit. I don\u2019t know what the right answer is here re wedding attendance - there probably isn\u2019t one, but Cassie needs to step up here and grow a spine else she sets herself go to be manipulated and controlled from here on in.", "Nta. \n\nLet everyone know she is marrying a bigot and asked for you and your SO to conform to their bigotry.", "YWNBTA. Cassie should be ashamed of herself for siding with and pandering to homophobes. The fact she\u2019s \u201cdevastated\u201d you\u2019re not going is mind boggling. What did she think would happen after she do eagerly shat on your marriage for her homophobic fianc\u00e9 and future in-laws. Gross.", "NTA. Ask your niece what will she do if she has a gay or trans child. Would she ask them to hide? Will she make them feel ashamed. Because that's what she is marrying into", "NTA - you don\u2019t have to pander to homophobes, ever, for any reason. If your niece cared about you as much as she says, she wouldn\u2019t be taking the side of the people who refuse to acknowledge that you exist (including her own fianc\u00e9e, from the sounds of it). \n\nYou & husband are right to be pissed off. Your niece is an asshole for enabling these people. Sean & his family are gigantic arseholes for their Stone Age views.", "Wow. NTA. Opposite sides of the banquet hall? They are deliberately going out of their way to clearly, overtly and publicly dishonour your relationship, and claim control. You do not have to cede moral control to a bunch of bigots.", "She chose to not hurt her homophobic and bigoted soon to be in laws' \"sentiments\" over her uncles who loved and supported her. OP's relatives chose to support her and her soon to in laws by extension and supported homophobia and bigotry. I feel bad for OP and his husband but they should go LC/NC with all those who supported this decision. OP and husband YWNBTA if they choose not to attend this event. This niece doesn't deserve to have guncles in her life.", "YWNBTA If  Sean's whole family cant support their own brother, it's no wonder Cassie is the same. The nut doesn't fall far from the tree.", ">it's starting to make me feel like we should just reconsider and go\n\nNo, you should be reconsidering whether Cassie has any place in your life from here on out. \n\nYou need to be paying attention to your husband and what he\u2019s saying and feeling. He\u2019s who is important. He is who you promised to love, honor, and protect. He comes first.   \n\n\nWhen you decide to marry a bigot and knuckle under to his bigoted family, then you become a bigot. Cassie is not who you think she is. Open your eyes.  \n\n>we've been bombarded with messages and calls from Sean's brothers and sisters telling us that Cassie is devastated and heartbroken\n\nOh, Cassie is heartbroken, is she? Yeah. All about her isn\u2019t it?    \n\n\nSHE IS NOT THE WRONGED PARTY HERE.   \n\n\nYTA if you attend the wedding. Think what message you\u2019ll be sending your husband.", "If Cassie doesn't stand up to the homophobia, she shows herself to be homophobic. I would just not attend and go NC. \n\nYWNBTA", "Exactly. They\u2019re demanding you respect his family and their new marriage whilst offering you absolutely no respect for your relationship and marriage in return.", "NTA, It's funny because the Pope has spoken out against homophobia. He still doesn't approve gay marriage. He urges that gay people should be treated with tenderness as God does with all his children. \n\nUnfortunately he still sees homosexuality as a sin but not a crime, but he says that its also a sin to lack charity with each other. \n\nThe church has a long way to go to catch up with society.", "What about matching lumberjack shirts if Op and husband fancy something casual? With matching jeans, maybe glitter laces on their boots for that subtle shimmer? I don\u2019t actually think they should go but if they do, I think going full fashion diva stereotypical \u2018what idiots think the gays wear\u2019 Priscilla Queen of the Desert with a giant shoe on top of the bus is the way forward.", "What if one of those ten kids is gay, to boot?  Cassie might want to think about how her children would be treated differently.", "Spoiler: She won't.", "She is.         \nShe\u2019s standing up for her future bank account", "Of course the in laws want to pay for everything. It means that they have control of everything. They get a say on it all. Its all about control. I mean Op and his husband seem to be huge parts of the nieces life and she is letting them do this because they are paying", "I know. Honestly. I would engage \u201cmy friends and family\u201d and ensure everyone has something \u201crainbow\u201d or gay pride on them somewhere. \n\nIt\u2019s like the Big Day Out that the Australian Govt banned anyone wearing the Australian Flag after some riots. They said the police would remove anyone with a flag on or a sticker of a flag. 99% of the 55,000 attendees wore flags. I have never ever seen so many flags in my life.", "I\u2019m betting it\u2019s because the fianc\u00e9s family has money", "It's close to a real-life *Birdcage* situation.  So wrong.", "I hope she is able to come through and stand up for them.", "Well christianity as a whole (not talking about any particular individuals here to be clear - there are obviously plenty of non asshole christians and plenty of assholes of other or no religions) has been acting TA to many people for a couple of millennia now so I guess it's not too surprising.", "Even if, there are lots of real people with that mindset out there. I grew up catholic, those stories sound all too familiar."]}
