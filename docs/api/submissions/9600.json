It's ridiculous that people love to still hide behind their religion to excuse their racism and bigotry.  It's just sad.

I'd be telling Cassie that you'll be booking your own room to stay together and that you expect to be seated together at the reception. And that this is the only compromise you'll settle for. (She probably doesn't want to have to go back to the parents and explain why you no longer need the accom... Which is weak. But alternatively, just agree and book your own accom anyway). \n\nYou can still be in family photos, just tell the bride and groom you refuse to be in photos with his parents as you find homophobic people highly offensive and not in line with your ethos. \n\nI mean, we literally had a referendum that proved to all the bigots his parents are wrong and gay marriage and partnership is strongly approved of in Australia. \n\nFuck I'm angry right now.

I wonder what else she'll be restricted to and whether she will be expected to have 10+ children if they are so strictly catholic.\n\nI'd want to go to see Cassie married but then I'd set the cat amongst the pigeons at the reception and talk about your relationship to everyone at the table.

I am not saying this to excuse her behaviour. I mean that if she\u2019s naive on this then she thinks it\u2019s just the wedding but she will have controlling bigoted in-laws in every part of her life from now on.
