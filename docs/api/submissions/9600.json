I made it very clear to family, day one, that one off handed remark about any of my friends, and I'd kick them out of the wedding and I'll walk myself down the aisle. I did a lot of other \"non-traditional\" things for my wedding as well, and my threat stood for those too. My dad came close, as expected, but everyone managed to keep their opinions to themselves, and the wedding was absolutely perfect. (My friends compromised with not cursing as much lol). The point is, Cassie is an adult, and if she doesn't stand up against bigots now, for people that apparently helped raise her, then she never will, and she's a biggot herself. And the family and fiance will think they are justified in dictating others lives forever. F her feelings, OP is NTA.", "Well said.", "Lmao", "And I will bet actual dollars that the people telling Sean and OP they should just be quiet and pretend they\u2019re not a couple would be LIVID if asked to do the same with their heterosexual partners. \n\nNTA, OP, but you and Sean just learned something awful about most of Sean\u2019s family, and I\u2019m so sorry.", "She had a close relationship with her uncles.

Ask them how would they like it if this was asked of them and what would be expected at future events that her fianc\u00e9 and his family are at. Ask his niece why if she think something like this is ok and if she understands what she\u2019s truly getting into by marrying into his family because if he\u2019s asking for this now what\u2019s he going to ask for in the future.", "From their mention of Perth, I'm assuming this takes place in Australia. So luckily, Op won't be forced to be around them as much as we don't do 4th of July or Thanksgiving.\n\n\nAlso Perth is one of the world's most remote cities and if op doesn't live there with his family it would mean much less chance of drop ins, kids birthdays, BBQs (we don't have cook outs either). It's faster and cheaper to fly to New Zealand from the east coast than to Perth.", "Oh you\u2019re completely right - I totally misread that. I\u2019ll edit.", "Got it in one. If I was her, I'd tell the fiance and his family to go fuck themselves and enjoy hell because despite being Catholic it's where they will end up for their disgusting views.", "I think you're right due to the fact they're paying for hotel rooms for the bride's family, some they haven't even met.", "When wearing rose tinted glasses, red flags just look like flags...", "You cannot force someone further down the path of enlightenment if they are not ready.", "Agador!!!!!!", "\"I can *change* him!!1!\"", "Yup, my vote would be to crash the wedding and be flaaaaaming.

Is Cassie prepared to have to cut her uncle and his husband out of everything for the rest of her life?", "Oh yeah. The full story.\n\nThe story of how he's not like that. But it *is* his family.

She should be editing the guest list or telling her bigoted future in laws how to behave. I hope she does the right thing.", "Flaming flapping sphincters... I lost it \ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso, NTA obviously!", "Honestly, if their niece is marrying into this kind of family; and expects her uncles to play \"straight\" for the night, there is something seriously wrong with her!
