Do they report to the police, and she gets the new charges anyway? Does the new babysitter accept your sister\u2019s suggestion of leaving the kids alone and whatever happens to the kids happens?

Although I would send her another voicemail and text message saying, she has to call you in 10 min and be home in 20 (and that is not negotiable!) or you are going to call the cops because of child abandonment. If she still choose to not responde, don't care it is her fault and she can not blame you, if she looses her children. She is an \"donkey\" for what she is doing here, but it would be the nice thing to do to give her this last change of a few minutes.", "NTA jeez your sister is not a good mother at all.
