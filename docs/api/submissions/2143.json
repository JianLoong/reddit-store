I've had more abusive choir teachers.\n\nFrom  the post: \" I wasn't there but my parents and sister have told me,\" so she has second-hand knowledge in addition to her bias and age, so there's no way for us to know for sure how the grandmother actually treated her sister.", "She was told she had no future if she didn't learn how to treat people. I feel that's a comment that needs more information before deciding if it was bullying. Sister bullying op, or being cruel 100% something that needed to be said. Sister did something thar could be considered disrespectful because of boundaries or something- like the family that say its rude not to get hugs - 100% grandma was a bully. Like.
