That\u2019s not okay, autism or not. It\u2019s only doing him a disservice in the long run.", "Maybe OP should've left the BF.", "Ew. Then she should have just written that she went to boyfriend's family's gathering.\n\nThey are not married. They are not in laws. Its not her nephew in anyway. OP should dump the family if it's a real story. \n\nESH.", "Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one day OP got home and the boyfriend had taken the dog to \u201cvisit\u201d the nephew, depending on how much access he has to her home.", "Yeah definitely get it chipped.", "*They* are going to make her life a living hell.", "you'll be diagnosed as a manic pixie dream girl and like it \ud83d\ude21 \n/s", "From what I understand, the boys are more likely to manifest the \"visible\" symptoms: the meltdowns, the rigidity, the obsessive interests. Girls tend to manifest inward and that is much more likely to get ignored in a prek-grade school setting.", "Had delays my entire childhood but was only diagnosed at almost 30 years old...after all 3 of my kids.", "Lovely story, glad it worked out so well", "Yessss my cat is just a regular (beautiful, amazing, loving) cat adopted at 3yrs and he comforts me when I\u2019m upset and helps me regulate my feelings and emotions \ud83d\ude0a I could never ever ever hurt an animal. He really helps me recover from meltdowns, also cheers me up in that post-meltdown exhaustion.", "same its very frustrating to say the least", "That makes me so sad \ud83d\ude14 I couldn't imagine doing that to one of my furs. My puppy is spoiled to me rubbing his gums at bedtime and I wouldn't have it any other way.", "Subscription GPS tags are better. I haven\u2019t had much luck with AirTags being able to locate my dogs.", "If they're in the USA most shelters have adoption parties where cats and dogs are really cheap if not free to adopt. As a puppy owner tho they may need to get a dog out of the teething stage lol", "Which is code for \"Whe should've left the puppy\". There are exactly two sides in this story:\n\nBeing appalled for them asking and leaving the puppy there. There is no middle ground.", "How does OP suck here?", "YES MOM\nSORRY MOM /s", "While I understand, I had both meltdowns and shutdowns and still was missed. Because they are often written off in girls as other things (dramatic, sensitive, manipulative) and not taken as seriously", "My boy got missed till he was 10 cos his meltdowns are internal, it was the other signs that finally got it noticed even though our entire family and close friends knew since he was 2", "I'm a guy and my diagnosis was missed because most of my symptoms manifest younger other than rigidity", "I had meltdowns so bad as a toddler that I would turn blue from holding my breath and passed out, still missed the diagnosis", "Girls are taught to mask and boys will be boys. Got it.", "Very common and I\u2019m sorry to hear that. I only generalized above as that\u2019s what research *says* but as we all know (as autistic females who got missed), most females with autism will get missed regardless of delays.", "That's how it was with my ADHD. Smh I'm seeing a therapist and he started asking random questions then was like why has no one diagnosed you with ADHD yet..", "Exactly! My cats can *feel* when I\u2019m getting overwhelmed and overstimulated and immediately apply pressure or come close. When I\u2019m already shutting down or melting down they give me space until it\u2019s over and then help in recovery.", "Doesn't say BF age or nephews age. Doesn't say how long they have been dating for. Sounds very attached to a very toxic relationship. \n\nIt makes 0 sense why bf would want his family to watch a new puppy for the night or weekend. Does BF have any ownership of the dog?\n\nShe does not mention anything about dumping him. She is being emotionally bullied and she is the AH for putting up with any of it.", "Same here, I'm having a huge light bulb moment. I will literally stutter or go fully nonverbal and still get told I don't \"seem autistic\"", "Is that an autism trait? Fuck, that explains a few things", "I wasn't even \"smart\". I was simply put in the smaller \"easy\" classes, but because I wasn't one of the class clowns I didn't get any of the help I needed. The teachers aids were always too busy dealing with the trouble makers to even think to help us few quieter kids in the class. It felt like my entire education was swept under the rug and deemed unimportant.", "Look up ADHD-PI.", "Honestly that sucks and I\u2019m sorry you were essentially gaslit over this. It\u2019s such a horrible feeling being convinced you\u2019re \u2018crazy\u2019, but equally such a relief when you realise you\u2019re not and it all makes sense and your experiences are real and valid. Best feeling in the world is meeting other autists and vibing and unmasking with them \ud83d\ude0a", "My apologies for offending you. I multiple family members and friends who are autistic, as well as knowing several folks with autistic children and having worked with them personally, and this is a distinction all make it a point to speak out about so I was going based off their preferences!", "No one is required to provide us ages unless the person posting deems it relevant or simply wants to say. In this case, it\u2019s not relevant. The length of their relationship means nothing because romantic timelines are different for everyone. What should happen at Month 6 for one couple, might be perfectly timed at Month 22 for another. Also, it\u2019s just not relevant here. They could be 5 weeks or 5 years in and it makes little to no difference. His mom might react that way and hate OP no matter when it happens.\n\nNothing about this relationship seemed toxic until the boyfriend\u2019s last comments. So OP isn\u2019t wrong for being attached to her boyfriend prior to knowing he\u2019d be willing to give away her dog because his mother and sister are annoying him. OP doesn\u2019t have to tell us if they want to dump him, because that\u2019s not relevant to the story.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think you read the post that well. They visited with the dog, they don\u2019t drop him off with strangers.\n\nCalling someone an asshole for \u201cnot dumping an ah\u201d when the question is not about whether or not to have a break up at all is the exact opposite of what\u2019s supposed to happen in this post. That is why so many people outside this sub hate it.", "Yeah, I guess it's not even always a \"stutter\", but it's like I just trip on my words and sometimes they'll even come out sounding like complete gibberish, if they even come out at all. It's beyond frustrating when you work in customer service.", "Man the whole \u201cyou don\u2019t seem autistic\u201d thing pisses me off no end. I like to think I\u2019m fairly eloquent and people seem to think that means I can\u2019t be autistic. Because I\u2019m academic and good at communicating (not even all of the time) It\u2019s like people expect me to be really simple.", "I feel like it\u2019s common enough among us that it could be, especially since we take longer to process speech usually. I\u2019m AuDHD so it could be different from someone who\u2019s only autistic, but that\u2019s my experience! It usually means I\u2019m getting overstimulated and need to chill/stim/remove myself before I have a shut down (more common these days for me than meltdowns)", "How frustrating? Did you eventually get the help you needed?", "I realized I put way too much detail in my last comment that\u2019s too much to read haha\n\nBut yes thank you!", "Could it be clustering? It's the other half of fluency disorders that stuttering falls under.", "I'm currently on a wait list to get the help I need. A 6 year wait list. There's a big health care shortage going on where I live right now.", "I 100% understand why OP would say that. As someone who has no kids and doesn't plan on it, I can't spot the difference between a meltdown and a tantrum, don't know the difference, and if I see a kid coming completely unglued in a hysterical way I'm extremely likely to use the 2 terms interchangeably."]}
