I recently got him. We traveled out of town with him, to see my in laws and my bf\u2019s autistic nephew was there he immediately took to my puppy and they spent most of the trip hanging out. His mom and MIL said they\u2019ve never seen him take to an animal like that and that him and my puppy have something special. Well when we were leaving he had a complete meltdown because he knew we were taking the puppy. His mom suggested we could let him stay and get a new puppy and MIL agreed. I said absolutely not because he\u2019s mine and I picked him out. If they want him to have a puppy they can go get him one. They said it\u2019s not that easy as my puppy is calm and they took to each other, which they did, but still he\u2019s mine. My boyfriend told me on the ride home his mom was saying a lot about me being selfish and cruel and he was wondering if we should\u2019ve just left him.
