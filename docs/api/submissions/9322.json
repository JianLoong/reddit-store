Even if she is a stay at home mom (which Idk bc it doesn't say in the post), her \"job\" is from 9-5 or whenever you're at work.

She's not asking you to care for the children 24/7 on the weeks you're at home, it sounds like she's doing half of it, meaning she's doing 75% of childcare. She needs time to herself, everybody does.

You get your fill of real alone time, but she gets nil.\n\nIs there any part of you that wants bonding time between dad and the kids instead of seeing them as something to divide and conquer? You know, since you're already missing half of their lives?\n\nNot only are YTA, but you're an idiot for wanting a life where it's not easier on your wife when you're home than when you're not.\n\nAlso, clean the damn kitchen after she cooks for you.

Your OWN children? You have to be a DAD? Without the teamwork of your wife??? Oh no! Shocked Pikachu face. And THIS is why moms get angry at their partners.

Do some laundry, run the vacuum, and send your hard working wife to the bedroom for some peace and quiet. She deserves it after hearing 10000+ questions a day with no way to escape.
