You didn\u2019t make him anything; he did that himself. I\u2019m shocked about how late he told you about the eviction. I\u2019ve worked for property management for a couple years and with the crisis of homelessness here and residual covid policies, it\u2019s timely to file the paperwork needed for an eviction notice and have it approved. Even if it\u2019s different where you are, he would have had to know about the eviction quite a bit before he served you. He could have told you earlier. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nBusiness is business indeed, but as your friend, he could have been a lot more lenient on you during a difficult situation. Especially if you really have been nothing but a good tenant during that time. I'm really not sure what he expected the outcome to be, giving a couple with a premature child just a month to find somewhere else to live. \n\nThe fact that the rest of your friends are siding with you says a lot. I'd wager that your landlord friend is only lashing out because he genuinely didn't expect this kind of backlash, and was only thinking of himself and the profits that he can make. \n\nHe's the one who has to grow up and face the harsh reality; if you don't treat a friend with kindness and respect in a tough situation, then don't expect to have friends for much longer.", "Definitely NTA. I can't imagine how stressful it is for you and your wife right now, and I hope your little girl is getting bigger and stronger every day.\n\nI've seen actual real estate agents act with more compassion. Considering you have been good long term tenants and the current state of the rental market, it's really quite cruel and an AH move to ask someone to move out like that, legal or not. Considering he's supposed to be your friend, would know that your wife was expecting, and then to have the emergency c-section on top of that - how does it come as a surprise that everyone would judge him for it?", "NTA\n\nHe made his choice to put his finances ahead of your comfort.  His right to do, but it\u2019s also his consequence that some people value community more than money.  You did nothing to him, he\u2019s reaping what he has sown.\n\nBusiness is business after all.", "It doesn't sound like you badmouthed him in your friends group, you just presented your situation to seek their help. So NTA.", "NTA - he prioritised business over friendship, and is now surprised he doesn't have friends. That's the end of it.", "Business is business. Unfortunately, once they realized what his business was, most of the friend group saw him for what he was.\n\nNTA. Dirtbags who are surprised at the consequences of their own actions are unlikely to change. Especially if they don't realize/admit the consequences are their own fault.", "NTA\n\nHe tried to evict you a week before your wife gave birth. That is not something a friend does. He fucked you over when he didn't have to.", "NTA. If he didn\u2019t want to be treated like a monster, he shouldn\u2019t have acted like a monster. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever be able to forgive him if I were you.", "Luckily for you, you get to see his true colours now rather than later and your other friends have good morals! His loss, good luck for your family !!!!", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t make him the monster, he IS the monster.\n\nEven if the law allows his actions, he is still the asshole.", "You didn\u2019t wash the dirty shit with your friends. You asked your friends for help when you were in a dire situation, which you were entitled to do. Your friends made their own decisions based on the information they had at hand. Your former landlord is angry that he\u2019s been cast aside for being a shit friend.", "NTA.  His choices in words and actions are the reason he finds himself where he is today.  I know what it's like to have pregnancy complications and deliver by emergency C 2 months early.  Best to you and your wife and baby daughter!  I'm glad you have good friends who care and support you.  Don't waste another thought on the guy.", "NTA. You didn't go badmouthing him. Your friends are just smart enough to tell and decide on their own. Either way, you don't need to deal with him anymore.", "NTA. He doesn't sound like a friend though.", "Eh. NTA.\n\nI would try and look at it from his situation though. Delaying and extending it would probably cost him thousands of dollars having to pay people who were scheduled to work. Also something to consider was if he ever really gouged you on rent, did he raise it significantly during the time you were a tenant? If he was good to you all these years and now he has a deadline coming that isn't fully under his control, maybe something to look at. Still don't think you're the asshole but I don't think it's all him being a greedy heartless bastard, I could be wrong, but I think there's room in the situation that it's possible that he's under the gun from other circumstances and he doesn't want to burden you with his problems.", "NTA. Landlords gonna lord the land and all.", "NTA. People who say \"business is business\" or \"nothing personal\" are liars. It is always personal. Accommodations can always be made.

With friends like this, you don't need enemies.", "His logic doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nYou didn\u2019t tell the realtor or future buyer what he did. You told your friends. You needed your friends help. That\u2019s what friends are for. \n\nDid he expect you to sleep on the streets to save his reputation? If he was a stranger landlord, you would have acted the same way. Why should your actions change because he was your friend when he won\u2019t give you the same courtesy??", "NTA\n\nHe made himself the monster of the situation. There was absolutely no need for him to be so cruel, except that he legally could. But there's legally right and morally right. They are very different things. And if you want to maintain friendships, being legally right is meaningless. It's your morals that make all of the difference. You and your friends realised that he is a bad person who will reduce friendships down to legalities. So you did the same. He did that all by himself."]}
