You didn\u2019t make him anything; he did that himself. I\u2019m shocked about how late he told you about the eviction. I\u2019ve worked for property management for a couple years and with the crisis of homelessness here and residual covid policies, it\u2019s timely to file the paperwork needed for an eviction notice and have it approved.

Especially if you really have been nothing but a good tenant during that time. I'm really not sure what he expected the outcome to be, giving a couple with a premature child just a month to find somewhere else to live. \n\nThe fact that the rest of your friends are siding with you says a lot. I'd wager that your landlord friend is only lashing out because he genuinely didn't expect this kind of backlash, and was only thinking of himself and the profits that he can make. \n\nHe's the one who has to grow up and face the harsh reality; if you don't treat a friend with kindness and respect in a tough situation, then don't expect to have friends for much longer.", "Definitely NTA. I can't imagine how stressful it is for you and your wife right now, and I hope your little girl is getting bigger and stronger every day.\n\nI've seen actual real estate agents act with more compassion.

NTA.\n\nI would try and look at it from his situation though. Delaying and extending it would probably cost him thousands of dollars having to pay people who were scheduled to work. Also something to consider was if he ever really gouged you on rent, did he raise it significantly during the time you were a tenant? If he was good to you all these years and now he has a deadline coming that isn't fully under his control, maybe something to look at. Still don't think you're the asshole but I don't think it's all him being a greedy heartless bastard, I could be wrong, but I think there's room in the situation that it's possible that he's under the gun from other circumstances and he doesn't want to burden you with his problems.", "NTA.
