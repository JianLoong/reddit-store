I'm really not sure what he expected the outcome to be, giving a couple with a premature child just a month to find somewhere else to live. \n\nThe fact that the rest of your friends are siding with you says a lot. I'd wager that your landlord friend is only lashing out because he genuinely didn't expect this kind of backlash, and was only thinking of himself and the profits that he can make. \n\nHe's the one who has to grow up and face the harsh reality; if you don't treat a friend with kindness and respect in a tough situation, then don't expect to have friends for much longer.", "Definitely NTA.

Also something to consider was if he ever really gouged you on rent, did he raise it significantly during the time you were a tenant? If he was good to you all these years and now he has a deadline coming that isn't fully under his control, maybe something to look at. Still don't think you're the asshole but I don't think it's all him being a greedy heartless bastard, I could be wrong, but I think there's room in the situation that it's possible that he's under the gun from other circumstances and he doesn't want to burden you with his problems.", "NTA.

If it was personal, they at last maybe perceived some reason to dislike you, whether you actually deserve it or not, whereas business is \"I never actually liked you enough to think of you as anything more than an asset I can use and discard when its convenient\"", "Surely he\u2019d have actually known months in advance. NTA! He doesn\u2019t like that others know how he behaved. What an AH he is. I hope your wife and daughter are ok. I\u2019m so sorry.", "[removed]", "Shitty people always demand a hundred times more courtesy than they'd ever be willing to give out.", "IMHO it's not even a matter of \"business is business, but as your friend...\". If a friend of mine was a landlord and I heard they kicked out people in OP's situation, even if I had never met the tenants, I would have a tough time staying friends with them.", "It\u2019s as he said, business is business. But being a strong-headed businessman doesn\u2019t exactly endear you to your friends, who don\u2019t expect such cruelty from those they\u2019d call a friend. He can\u2019t have it both ways. OP and their friend group are NTA, and I hope his friend pulls his head out of his ass before he ends up completely cut off from the group.", "It's not even business over friendship. It's business over humanity. If he did that to a complete stranger I would still be horrified and would definitely end the friendship. I've been a landlord before. I would never do what he did, especially to a good tenant of 6 years.", "\"Business is business\" this dude really thinks he's Michael Corleone or something.", "Business can and constantly does make people assholes.", ">His family should never have done business with you.\n\n\nOkay. \n\nAnd it was at that critical time that he chose to remember that?", "Or, hell, money ahead of \"decent human\" things. I don't think I've had a single landlord who wouldn't have extended a month under these circumstances. Act like a soulless greedy cooperation, get treated like one.", "[removed]", "I'm a landlord (just because my work took me abroad so I have to rent our london flat). \n\nI wouldn't do this even to new tenants, regardless of the law. \n\nFFS we have one time at life. Why would anyone behave like this? \n\nWhen I die I want to feel like I was an OK person. I'm not Buddha by any fucking means but I will always do whatever I can within my capabilities to help others out. \n\nWow. NTA by any means.", "[removed]", "The landlord filed paperwork and informed his tenant knowing full well he intended to evict a woman that would have been 8 months pregnant had the complications and emergency c section not taken place.", "As Jack Donoghue said on 30 Rock:\n\n> Never do business with a friend, never be friends with a women, and never go with a hippie to a second location.\n\nAt least 2/3rds of that is good advice.", "[removed]", "When my landlord wasn\u2019t able to renew my lease, I think he let me know 10 months in advance. \n\nOP\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d is trash.", "Tinfoil hat, he wanted them out before the baby was born. Pick a reason but the timing is short and suspicious.", "Exactly. Just stating the bald facts in this situation would be enough to piss off anyone with the least bit of empathy.", "I actually kind of hate the \"business is business\" expression and idea.  Business doesn't have to be cruel, and \"I want to extract every penny from this situation that I can\" doesn't make a shitty action more excusable or less shitty.  \"Business is business, it's not personal,\" like are you kidding, this is my home here.  Just because you don't feel any kind of way about evicting me doesn't make it less personal *for me*.\n\nOP and all the friends who ostracized this dude are NTA.", "Oh it\u2019s way too late for that. He could\u2019ve made OP and his very pregnant/ready to give birth at any day wife homeless without another thought. No one in that friend group is going to want to associate with someone like that.", "Exactly!  Take out the friendship part and it\u2019s still wrong!  Given the situation most landlords would extend the the deadline given he is a good tenant and the extenuating circumstances.  \n\nIt\u2019s human decency\n\nTheir friends rallied around OP and helped him when needed based on the situation the friends had to find out what happened", "Exactly, I came here to say I've had some shitty landlords but I don't think a single one of them wouldn't have extended a month for this reason.", "That got me as well...what was so damn important about postponing by another 30 days?", "I was renting from an acquaintance of my mom (their daughter and I lived in the unit together). I was supposed to move out April 1 in 2020. March 28th, I got a call that I'd been exposed to COVID at work and had to completely isolate  for 2 weeks. I called my landlord and he had absolutely no issue with me staying in the apartment for my isolation and then moving out (his daughter had already gone home mid-March when shit hit the fan). I offered to pay rent for half of April and he refused and just told me to stay safe and clean up before I left. You can bet I cleaned the *heck* out of that apartment", "I extended notice by multiple months more for my tenants for having a death in their extended family. OP\u2019s former friend is the worst kind of person. Hiding behind it being \u201cjust business\u201d ignores that their relationship was much more than just a business relationship. And frankly I wouldn\u2019t want to know anyone that would treat a random tenant like that either, whether or not they knew them better.", "Comment stealing bot", "Comment stealing bot", "Bots stealing from bots.", "And the fact that he wouldn't give him an extension even when the wife and baby were still hospitalized? Nope. \n\nMy guess is that someone (or some landlord forum) told him that once a tenant had a baby that was living in the rental it would be 'so much harder to evict' or something. So he let that advice get in his head and he forgot how to be a human being with compassion. He's only upset now because his other friends also realized that he forgot how to be a human being with compassion and now he's left with the cold comfort of 'business is business' now that he's been shunned by his friend group.", "Yup this NTA op that \"friend\" is a greedy pig", "> Business doesn't have to be cruel\n\nEh. The more cruelty, the more profit. The fact that certain economic systems incentivize cruelty, and make cruelty inevitable, is basically why many people have anticapitalist politics.", "not with over two weeks notice it wouldn't have.", "It's funny, though \u2014 if they weren't friends, the answers here would have been pretty evenly split. *Sometimes* this sub distinguishes between \"legally right vs. morally wrong,\" but a lot of people take the \"your house, your rules\"/\"business is business\" mindset when property ownership and tenancy is concerned.\n\nTruth is, evicting a family experiencing a major medical crisis is always a deeply harmful and selfish thing to do. Because the landlord in question is some guy instead of a corporation, and because the tenant in question is his ex-friend in a mutual friend group instead of a stranger, this particular shitty landlord will at least experience some small portion of the deserved consequence, in the form of social ostracism.", "K bro. The entirety of construction and the meme of delays causing problems with housing clearly doesn't exist because everyone is in the same schedule with 2 weeks notice. I think you do not realize the amount of moving parts involved with what renovating a property entails.", "Its almost like the two situations which are grossly similar can actually be quite different when the fine details are considered..."]}
