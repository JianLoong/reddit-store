Dad is the asshole.", "NTA. Since you paid for it, there is no reason why you should have to give your bird to her, especially if your mother told both you not to trade birds. She made a bad decision in which birds to take, it may not be her fault but it is her responsibility.", "NTA - you paid for the bird yourself and Mom set the not trading rule in the beginning. Honestly your dad is the A-hole for trying to make the younger one happy at your expense.", "NTA.\n\n>My Mom explicitly told her that she may not trade birds once we get home as I paid for mine and she paid for hers\n\nVery clear and simple. Nice title by the way.", "NTA. Your parents are total assholes for seemingly not doing their homework on birds. Birds scream and bite because they are in some sort of distress, and it's on the owners to manage their interactions with the bird to cut down on that distress/behavior. I really hope they aren't expecting a 6 year old to understand how to manage the birds \u2639", "NTA \nTwo birds for a 6yr?? I\u2019m hoping your family has had birds before or has done enough research.", "Based on the information you provided, it seems like you're not the one being mean in this situation. You followed the agreement that was made by your parents, which said that the birds couldn't be traded once they were chosen. Plus, you didn't have any control over the behavior of the bird your sister picked, which turned out to be aggressive and bitey.\n\nIt's understandable that your dad wants to solve the problem by suggesting that you give your bird to your sister because it's nice and well-behaved. But it's important to remember that you made your choice based on your own likes and dislikes, and it wouldn't be fair for your dad and sister to push you into giving up your bird.\n\nMaybe you can have a calm and respectful chat with your parents to explain why you made the decision you did. Let them know that you followed the initial agreement and that it's not your fault that your sister's bird turned out to be a handful.\n\nIn the end, it's all about finding a fair solution that works for everyone. Good luck!", "NTA\nGo back to the pet shop they will probably let her exchange", "NTA but I hope, for the sake of your sister's birds, that you help her take care of them. Not a great gift for a 6-year-old kid. Hopefully when they're less stressed out (from being kept in a box for hours!) they'll be less bitey and screechy.", "NTA. It sounds like your mom is the actual parent, and your dad just comes up with these ideas as he is unfamiliar with the dynamic.", "NTA since dad wanna be a AH and teach your sister to trade and get other peoples stuff tell him to pay u for the bird u brought....\nMom should tell him off...\nSister new the rule dad is a total AH and will set your sister up to learn the hard way in the future", "Info: did your family did some research? They are not toys. If not, your parents are the assholes.", "It'd be a nice thing for you to do, but you're NTA for keeping the one you chose and paid for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

End of story. It was basically a lucky dip. You can\u2019t swap out the prize if you\u2019re not happy with what you got. All fairness aside, what kind of bird is it? I keep small parrots and even though they are hand reared, my 5 year old knows better than to touch. The only time she\u2019s allowed to hold the birds are when she\u2019s calm, sitting down, and we go through the rules of no sudden moves and no loud sounds. If your sister was making the regular excited squeals of a 6yo, the birds would\u2019ve bitten as a fear response.", "NTA birds are living creatures not Pok\u00e9mon cards, you can't trade them. That bird is yours.", "Wait what? NTA", "Yeah, make sure to tell your Mom if your Dad keeps pressuring you. NTA", "Yep...\nAlthough some birds just bite because they're jerks. One of mine sits behind my beck and bites for fun. His buddy will fly over, bite me and leave unless he wants attention."]}
