In order to house 3 budgies, a cage must be **at minimum** 23\"\u00d723\"\u00d723\", but ideally would be taller. Cages should be made of stainless steel (otherwise they'll rust, or have been coated in a hemical finish that's toxic for birds), the cage bars should be vertical with the spacing between them being 1/2\", cages cannot have an exposed wire bottom, and need to have a variety of toys and perches for the birds. Many of the toys sold for budgies aren't actually suitable for them however, and can have toxic materials, or have other dangers. Avoid toys with nylon, rope that isn't plant based or is too tightly bound, mirrors, sandpaper, woven materials that they can get their feet stuck in or pull apart, the list goes on.

My sisters love them. (My oldest sister did have an incredibly smart, awesome bird). Im not saying they dont make good pets for some ppl, just not my cup of tea.

This goes for *any* pet.", "Lmao they got *one* bird, and another two are in the house. Birds should never be alone. That alone is cruel. Its insane they discuss about such petty things while everything is totally fucked up. So you can safely assume, nothing you wrote will be done. They just don't care. They only care about their drama.", "Your sister simply chose poorly and now has to work on training her birds.", "I'm guessing OP will be taking care of their own bird, while the parents will be taking care of the sister's bird. Dad wants to deal with the easier of the two.", "Could be the daughter is younger and the boy is more mature to domesticate an animal and won't man handle it or be scared of it if it bites. \n\nI am not justifying it by any means. This is why animals don't make good gifts for children.", "I mean, we don't need to jump to favoritism over this. I think that's just putting doubts that almost certainly aren't there into OP's mind. OP is 15, the sister is 6, I can see the logic for giving her the \"calmer\" animal. It's not fair at all, but I can see the logic behind it.", "I can see the logic of *picking* a calm already trained animal for a 6yo,  I can not see the logic of invalidating the daughter's choice after the picking was allowed to happen\n\nI do agree, small children and animals do not mix well", "I agree that a cat would be a much better choice for a child's first pet and as a family pet in general. My heart breaks for all of the small pets that are purchased by people who don't really care about their lives and just give them to their kids as casually as they would give toys. I know kids will beg and push relentlessly for a pet, but ultimately, it's up to the parents to make the right choice for their family.", "> I can not see the logic of invalidating the daughter's choice after the picking was allowed to happen\n\nThe logic is \"I'm gonna have to take care of the daughter's bird, I don't wanna get bit\" lol.\n\nBut yea, this whole thing is a disaster in the making. I'm getting the impression that no one in this family is really well equipped enough to care for birds.", "I just heard an item where there was an experiment on socializing parrots via zoom.\n\nFound the link.\n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-taught-pet-parrots-to-video-call-each-other-and-the-birds-loved-it-180982041/", "Can confirm on the vet care.
