In order to house 3 budgies, a cage must be **at minimum** 23\"\u00d723\"\u00d723\", but ideally would be taller. Cages should be made of stainless steel (otherwise they'll rust, or have been coated in a hemical finish that's toxic for birds), the cage bars should be vertical with the spacing between them being 1/2\", cages cannot have an exposed wire bottom, and need to have a variety of toys and perches for the birds. Many of the toys sold for budgies aren't actually suitable for them however, and can have toxic materials, or have other dangers. Avoid toys with nylon, rope that isn't plant based or is too tightly bound, mirrors, sandpaper, woven materials that they can get their feet stuck in or pull apart, the list goes on.

My sisters love them. (My oldest sister did have an incredibly smart, awesome bird). Im not saying they dont make good pets for some ppl, just not my cup of tea.

This was a bird that I had been trained to sit on my shoulder and have cuddles and after the cage dropped I had to move him to the avery with my other parrots (I used to breed African Love Birds) because he would freak out and got aggressive when anyone came near him even though the drop happened while my dad and I were at work. I managed to get him to come up to me on the avery side, but he never let me hold him again.

People don\u2019t realise what a commitment birds really are and how long they live for. One of the most dumped pets that people have. Especially when they realise after the fact that they make a lot of noise. They can live for years and years. Is a 6 year old, 15 year old or parents committed to caring for these for potential decades? Just encouraging the pet trade and creating more demand for pet stores animals that suffer greatly."]}
