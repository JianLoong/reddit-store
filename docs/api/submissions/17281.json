Dad is the asshole.", "NTA. Since you paid for it, there is no reason why you should have to give your bird to her, especially if your mother told both you not to trade birds. She made a bad decision in which birds to take, it may not be her fault but it is her responsibility.", "NTA - you paid for the bird yourself and Mom set the not trading rule in the beginning. Honestly your dad is the A-hole for trying to make the younger one happy at your expense.", "NTA.\n\n>My Mom explicitly told her that she may not trade birds once we get home as I paid for mine and she paid for hers\n\nVery clear and simple. Nice title by the way.", "NTA. Your parents are total assholes for seemingly not doing their homework on birds. Birds scream and bite because they are in some sort of distress, and it's on the owners to manage their interactions with the bird to cut down on that distress/behavior. I really hope they aren't expecting a 6 year old to understand how to manage the birds \u2639", "NTA \nTwo birds for a 6yr?? I\u2019m hoping your family has had birds before or has done enough research.", "Based on the information you provided, it seems like you're not the one being mean in this situation. You followed the agreement that was made by your parents, which said that the birds couldn't be traded once they were chosen. Plus, you didn't have any control over the behavior of the bird your sister picked, which turned out to be aggressive and bitey.\n\nIt's understandable that your dad wants to solve the problem by suggesting that you give your bird to your sister because it's nice and well-behaved. But it's important to remember that you made your choice based on your own likes and dislikes, and it wouldn't be fair for your dad and sister to push you into giving up your bird.\n\nMaybe you can have a calm and respectful chat with your parents to explain why you made the decision you did. Let them know that you followed the initial agreement and that it's not your fault that your sister's bird turned out to be a handful.\n\nIn the end, it's all about finding a fair solution that works for everyone. Good luck!", "NTA\nGo back to the pet shop they will probably let her exchange", "NTA but I hope, for the sake of your sister's birds, that you help her take care of them. Not a great gift for a 6-year-old kid. Hopefully when they're less stressed out (from being kept in a box for hours!) they'll be less bitey and screechy.", "NTA. It sounds like your mom is the actual parent, and your dad just comes up with these ideas as he is unfamiliar with the dynamic.", "NTA since dad wanna be a AH and teach your sister to trade and get other peoples stuff tell him to pay u for the bird u brought....\nMom should tell him off...\nSister new the rule dad is a total AH and will set your sister up to learn the hard way in the future", "Info: did your family did some research?

End of story. It was basically a lucky dip. You can\u2019t swap out the prize if you\u2019re not happy with what you got. All fairness aside, what kind of bird is it? I keep small parrots and even though they are hand reared, my 5 year old knows better than to touch. The only time she\u2019s allowed to hold the birds are when she\u2019s calm, sitting down, and we go through the rules of no sudden moves and no loud sounds. If your sister was making the regular excited squeals of a 6yo, the birds would\u2019ve bitten as a fear response.", "NTA birds are living creatures not Pok\u00e9mon cards, you can't trade them. That bird is yours.", "Wait what? NTA", "Yeah, make sure to tell your Mom if your Dad keeps pressuring you. NTA", "Yep...\nAlthough some birds just bite because they're jerks. One of mine sits behind my beck and bites for fun. His buddy will fly over, bite me and leave unless he wants attention.", "Send the poor birds back and do some research first. Pets are not toys. Your parents are the ahs in this case.", "NTA.\n\nA 6 yo should not be a primary pet caregiver.", "NTA, but I feel so sorry for those birds\u2026", "NTA - but as a bird owner, not many 6 year olds are great bird owners.\n\nThey aren\u2019t dogs or cats, trust is won slowly and even the most loving bird will bite. They have no other way of saying, no, not now.\n\nAnd also sometimes they just feel like being dicks.\n\nAs human owners we have to just always have gentle hands regardless.\n\nYou might end up with 3 birds is what I\u2019m saying.", "NTA\n\nYour sister choose first, and you paid for your bird.\n\nYour father was TA io get involved.", "Absolutely NTA", "You are NTA ---- but I hope that your family has done a boatload of research before procuring these birds because these are _very_ demanding pets and it sounds like y'all may have bit off more than you can chew.  If you use TikTok, Bird Tails is absolutely mandatory viewing as they do such a wonderful job of giving you tips, tricks, and rules for caring for your flock. \ud83d\udc26\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f", "Nta. Get a pitbull instead.", "NTA.\n\nDad should domesticate sisters awful birds since he cares so much.", "NTA and you never say what kind of bird. Some species live for decades and become generational pets passed down in a family.", "NTA but your sis and dad are. So sorry he\u2019s trying to guilt trip you.", "NTA. all animals scream and bite if you take them out of their usual habitat (in this case the store). you have to leave them alone for a few days so they can settle a bit, they're scared and stressed. get some research done, don't just buy a pet.", "NTA", "Is there any chance sister was shaking her box?", "Yay, go mums\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "Most birds kept as pets aren't even inherently domesticated even if they are captive bred. They're not like dogs or cats which are mostly domesticated.", "Sister is 6 and has no responsibility. Treating her as if she should be able to cope with the unsuitable birds she chose is bad parenting; telling OP to give up his choice that he bought with his money is also bad parenting.\n\nSister is too young to be responsible for her own pet. She needs to learn how to deal with pets and how to deal with a pet not being textbook fluffy under the guidance of her parents.", "Also, her being 6, I bet she chose the most hyperactive birds. Their personalities can be really wide ranging. We had a parakeet that was incredibly sweet and a rescue cockatiel that was traumatized and angry, but we eventually bonded. Animals respond to the person!", "Thus. NTA", "That's what I said in my comment.  Why the hell would the parents be cool with their children getting birds on a whim --- especially birds from a pet store.  I really don't care for anything about this scenario as I'm willing to bet good money that little (if any) research was done before getting the birds.  Extensive research should be done before getting any kind of pet, nevermind a bird that lives for 20-50+ years, has a very unique personality/body language that needs to be understood, and is VERY expensive to care for.", "YES YES YES.  I really do hope that pet store has a return policy because there should be a MINIMUM of 12 months of extensive research into bird ownership before procuring a bird.  The fact that the pet store sold 2 birds to a family that is absolutely clueless about bird ownership is the exact reason why I have a love-hate relationship with pet stores.", ">A 6 yo should not be a primary pet caregiver.\n\nI wouldn't trust a 6 year old to care for a pet rock --- nevermind a pet with high needs like a bird!  Hell, I religiously follow bird TikTok and I know for a fact that I could never own a bird!", "No, OP shouldn't help her sister take care of the birds unless OP *wants* to do so. **The parents who decided it was a good idea to give a six year old two birds** should help the six year old take care of them. OP is also a child, and while arguable old enough to take care of her own bird, the parents are ultimately responsible for that bird too.", "Yeah I wouldn't expect my 11 year old to care for a cat or dog impeccably, let alone something more demanding and specific like a fucking bird. And six year old got not one...but two. \n\n\nI want to know what these parents are even thinking.", "Yep, daughter is getting a dog (she\u2019s 10), I\u2019m under no illusion that it won\u2019t be me doing most of the looking after. She wanted a bird first, I said \u2018nope, nope and double nope\u2019, I know absolutely zero about looking after a bird, it\u2019s not happening.  One thing is for certain there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be leaving all the looking after to her, I suspect he may end up being my dog\u2026"]}
