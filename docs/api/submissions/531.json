She is a friend of mine in uni. She is moving on with her study as said, and I heard from my professor that her roommate is also getting the help she needs, although they are still not talking. Asking me to post this on Reddit for honest opinions)\n\nMy roommate of 2 years and I got along well since the day we first met on the first day of university (we even called each other our best friend). It\u2019s now our 3rd year, although we aren\u2019t really as enthusiastic about each other (as \u201cbest friends\u201d would), we each have our separate lives outside our dorm, but we were always on good terms.\n\n3 months ago she started her gaming addiction, staying in her room 24/7, I heard gaming noises, keyboard smashing and foul language. I thought it was nothing at first as I also had siblings who grew up with games. She would still respond if I ask for her, and we had dinner every night together.\n\nBut it was getting worse with time. She wouldn\u2019t leave her room, stopped attending lectures and doing work. Food delivered to her bedroom door. She only came out to use the bathroom, barely said a word to me.\n\nIt was the last straw, when I started finding small bugs everywhere. When I took out a book from my shelf, there were 10-20 bugs on the ruined pages, I screamed and threw it on the floor. And a foul smell, they were all coming from her room. I put up living with a literal parasite, but it has gotten to the point where it\u2019s affecting me too, especially in this important stage of my academic life.\n\nFinally I decided to take matters into my own hands because she won\u2019t. I got surgical masks and gloves, and starting cleaning out her room. Piles of half eaten take-outs was the source of the bugs and smell, it was a literal bio-hazardous wasteland. Underneath the food was her gaming merchandises (posters, cut-outs). I tried to keep what was salvageable, but they were broken and moldy.\n\nWhen she came back to find 6 trash bags outside our dorm, and her room completely different, she freaked out, and started yelling and crying at me. I expected this, and decided that enough was enough. I told her that it was for her own good, I couldn\u2019t see her self-destruct like this and it\u2019s affecting me too.\n\nWe both moved out of our dorm, reporting it as a bug infestation, nothing else. I got a different roommate and never saw her again (but she\u2019s still in the same uni). I started getting messages from some of her other friends (who knows where she got them) calling me an AH for throwing her stuff out without her consent, or saying I could have just asked the university for another dorm. First of all, if I reported her to the university, she would already have been kicked out. And until this day, I left it as a bug infestation, nothing else, when they(staff) asked me how did I let it get this bad, i mentioned nothing about my roommate\u2019s addiction.\n\nI felt like I did the right thing, but the respond is just making me doubt myself. I  just need someone to tell me before I leave this is behind to focus on my study, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667153441, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhlizj/aita_for_cleaning_out_all_my_roommates_things/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your ex friend is. She's clearly going through something and whatever it is, it will catch up to her. Ignore her friends.  Worry about yourself and your schooling. They're not worth it.", "NTA.  You cleaned up an obvious mold and bug problem that had escaped her room and didn't tell the university about her mental health issue, which yes, would have had her likely expelled.  More than generous.    \n\n\nUnfortunately, I have firsthand experience with this living in my undergrad co-op.  In my case, his parents sent him the tuition check, which he spent on anime and gaming.  He stopped attending classes and barricaded himself in his room.  His parents had to fly in from California and we had to threaten to call the police to break his door in.  There was quite a mess to clean up.", "You passed over many opportunities to do something less drastic. It was wrong to throw out her stuff, even if you thought it was for her own good, without first trying to talk to her. Even if you didn't think it would change anything, it would have been the right thing to do. You could have even given her an ultimatum: she needs to get rid of the trash and moldy things right now or you'll talk to the university because it's affecting your own health and wellbeing.\n\nI sympathize with you, and I DON'T think yta, but you could have handled that better.", "ESH.\n\nYour roommate sucks for letting it get so bad her room became a biohazard, but you for throwing out her stuff behind her back. That was not the way to go about handling this at all, and honestly probably made things worse.\n\nDid you try to confront her about her habits at all before it got to this point? Or contact student housing to intervene? Most unis have RAs for exactly this reason. \n\nWhatever is going on with her is clearly pretty serious and well outside of what you are able to fix - people don't change that drastically without a good reason. She needs professional help, not a roommate turning the one space she has upside down \"for her own good\". \n\nYou'd be fully within your rights to call her out, try to get her help, move out or even report her... Any of those may have been the wakeup call she needed, but violating her trust and privacy is not ok. 2 wrongs don't make a right.", "YTA she was your friend, she was clearly having a mental health break down, you should have reported her your RA in the dorm. You NEVER should have touched her property, even if it was moldy, bug covered, and smelly without informing the dorm managers to the issue.", "ESH (you more than her).\n\nObviously, she's also an adult who shouldn't have let it get this far. But after living with my fair share of roommates, I feel pretty comfortable saying that some people really just have horrible hygiene protocols and trash/dirt/cold/etc. doesn't phase them. \n\nMaybe you missed adding it here, but it seems like you went from 0 to 100 - there's no mention of you talking to her, working with her, asking about next steps to make the space work for both of you. You just say you put up with it then one day decided to go nuclear. Had you decided it wasn't a good fit and moved out - or taken any action to get her help - then you wouldn't be an AH but you went too far, violated her space, and threw out her things. That's not ok.", "A gentle ESH (towards you)\n\nObviously your roommate is TA for her behavior and lifestyle and it's affect on you.\n\nBut with a situation like hers, going in and cleaning out everything like that-even though you had good intentions- makes situations like hers worse.  Her problem isn't that she's gross, it's that something happened and the being gross is a symptom of that. No one wants to live that way. I hope she was able to get help.", "NTA. She should get her shit together and stop living like an absolute slob.", "YTA with good intentions.  You should have gotten ahold of a colleges crisis counselor and reported the mental health issue.  You did her no favors by protecting her damaged state of well being.", "If your intention was to help your friend, there were many steps to be taken before reaching the point of taking the most extreme action (which was to violate her privacy and throwing away her possessions without her consent). If your intention was to do something to protect yourself, which is understandable, there were better options, the most obvious and easiest of which being moving out. YTA.", "YTA.\nI mean you are not that bad. You cleaned her stuff which is considered a good job but imo you shouldn't have.\n\nWhile I lived with my parents during covid lock down, my mum had this habit of coming in my room when I'm not there and clean / rearrange stuff. That was so frustrating for me. Let me explain why. We all have a different organization system. If I have placed something somewhere, in the back of my mind I know where it's kept. So even after weeks or months if I want that something, I can easily locate it.\nMy mum's interference made it difficult for me.\n\nNow I know she did it out of care and I love her so no, she isn't an asshole but yeah she did inconvenience me a lot.\n\nThis must be one of the things your roommate might have felt too.", "YTA, because all you did was kick the can down the road and do what was easiest for you. I would have said not if you had reported her to the ra or uni, then she could have gotten help.", "NTA...\n\nWhen it gets to the point that her behaviour in her room is affecting the hygiene of your space as well as the common area, going into her room and throwing out half eaten take out is not an AH move.\n\nHowever it was an unnecessary one, since you should've just moved out of that dorm ASAP instead. She's going through something that clearly you cannot help with.", "NTA\n\nShe could make your life difficult. I hope you took photos because if/when this morphs into you trashed all of her worldly possessions, you have proof that you only threw away actual rotting garbage.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
