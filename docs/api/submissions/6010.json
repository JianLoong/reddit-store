We have been together for 4 years and have lived together since the early days of our relationship until I had to move several states away for medical school.\n\nI currently have $110k on student loans so far since I started and by the time I graduate I probably will have $220k total in loans. When I had to move to a suburban area with limited public transportation options, I looked into buying a car and initially was looking to get a used car within the $15-20k range. He told me to instead buy a newer, more reliable vehicle but as I explained to him I was limited by my loan budget. He then offered to subsidize my car loan payments by giving me downpayment money of $10k.\n\nFast forward to a few months later, the new car got delivered to the dealership and I signed all the paperwork myself. It ended up costing $31k OTD at a good interest rate (i think) at 3.9% over 4 years. I told bf about finalizing the deal and he immediately sent me the $10k. What he didnt know was that I loaned the whole amount and instead put all of the downpayment money on a brokerage account and bought some stocks and mutual funds. He found out about my lie when I visited for the holidays and we were in bed one day watching funny cat videos on my phone and saw an email pop up on my phone about the auto pay payment coming up. He realized that the math didnt add up and confronted me about why i never paid the downpayment he gave me. I said it was a bad idea since I got a low auto loan rate and thought he wasnt gonna understand since he\u2019s never cared about investing anyways (he doesnt even know what a 401k or a Roth is).\n\nHe has since then given me the cold shoulder since after Christmas and my family thinks im an AH for lying to him though i thought i made a good financial move. Reddit, AITA?\n\nETA after reading all of the comments here I will be talking to him after he gets off work tomorrow (he left at 5am this morning and I was sleeping). Someone suggested making it a joint or make it hus account if he doesnt want me to liquidate. Short term capital gains tax is huge and waiting out a few more months we will get tax advantages", "created_utc": 1672408391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz12jm/aita_28f_for_lying_to_my_boyfriend_30m_about/", "score": 575, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stop trying to justify it by talking about how little your BF knows about investing.  If you were as financially savvy as you think, you wouldn't have gotten a $30K car from a dealer when a cheaper car would get the job done.  More importantly, you took advantage of your BF's generosity.  Makes me feel all icky inside.", "So basically you stole the money he gave for a specific purpose and you wonder why he is mad and if you're the AH?\n\nGuess what?  YTA\n\nYou do realize he could take you to court for this?", "YTA - he didn\u2019t give you the money to invest. He gave it to you to have a safer car than you said you could afford. Then you didn\u2019t talk to him about it.", "YTA - I would dump you for this.", "That $10k was for the specific purpose of allowing you to get a new car at a lower rate - not a gift for you to do whatever the heck you chose with it.\n\nFurthermore, your bf having less student debt than you has *absolutely* no relevance here. The fact that you've included this information strongly implies that you feel somehow entitled to this money, because you have debt and he doesn't.

Hope you have plans to give him his money back now.", "YTA Thats a breach of trust, and a breach of a financial compact between  you.", "YTA\n\nIt would be difficult for me to trust someone who did something like this. If I did get over it, I\u2019d never comingle finances moving forward. \n\nBut knowing what I do now having been married to someone who did shady shit with the money I gave them? I\u2019d be done. No second chance on financial abuse.", "YTA. Now, he has no reason to trust you with money. A simple conversation would have been much better", "Of course YTA. The 10k was to go towards a car, not for you to invest in. If you weren't going to use it for a car you should have returned it. No wonder your bf is giving you the cold shoulder, I would too if someone did this to me.", "YTA. You're a 28 year old who doesn't understand that when someone gives you that sum of money for a vehicle, you're not supposed to go and do something else with that money?  Are you up?  When are you paying him back then.", "YTA \n\nYes, you got a good rate.  Your partner offered 10k to allow you to get a new car while still spending within what you budgeted.  $10k down would have significantly lowered your monthly payment and overall interest.\n\nAt 31k you\u2019re probably paying about 680/month with approx $2400 paid in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nAt 21k your payments would have been below $470/m with approx. $1600 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nInstead of using the money for the specific purpose it was given you invested it.  \n\nBanking 101: unless the investment is guaranteed to earn at a higher rate than the interest you\u2019re paying, put the money on the loan.\n\nHuman 101: when given money for a specific purpose, use the money for the purpose given.\n\nPs - in the current market my (fairly diversified) 401k lost 19% last year.\n\nEdit to fix calculations", "YTA, of course.  The issue isn't whether you made a \"good financial move\" the question is whether you lied to your boyfriend about a large amount of money that he gifted to you for a specific purpose.", "YTA. You lied to him.", "Yta. If you want to make \"smart financial  moves\" use your own money. Not money  loaned to you for a specific purpose. You knew what you were doing was wrong. Which is why you didn't tell him. Yta and deceitful one at that", "YTA. That money was for a down payment on a vehicle. If you didn't intend to use it for that you should have given the money back.", "You\u2019re going into surgery eventually, aren\u2019t you? \n\nAsk me why I think this. \n\nYTA and stay glad far away from patients as possible.", "He gave you that money with a clear understanding of what you were going to do with it. You decided to use 10k of his money to do what you want instead and then keep him in the dark about it - if I was him, I would be LIVID and would rethink a lot of thins about this relationship.\n\nYTA no matter how much you try to justify it. \"good financial move\" does not mean \"keep my partner in the dark about HIS money that he gave me for a car\"", "YTA- he gave you that money for the car, you decided to use it on stocks. He gave it to you for a specific purpose. If you wanted to invest, you should\u2019ve used your own money, not the money he gave you to help you out.", "YTA 100%!!! If you were not using the money for the car in the end, you should have returned his money immediately, This is deceitful, irresponsible and downright disrespectful to your boyfriend.", "YTA, pay that money back right now. You shouldn't invest loaned money.", "YTA. Further, there's no chance you are earning as much on your $10K \"investment\" as the interest accruing on your $110K of loans. So, you basically ruined your relationship to get further into debt and pay more interest on a car and student loans because you consider yourself financial savvy; yet have not ever supported yourself.", "YTA. Totally. He did a nice thing for you (but clearly defined what it was for), and you decided to spit on that and do what you thought was best. Then you somehow turned it around on him and insulted his money management, which is just wild. \n\nI think you know that this is wrong, too, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have hidden it from him.", "YTA.  If your bf wanted you to invest his money, he would have asked you to do so. You lied to your bf and stole from him.", "YTA, great, you were able to finance the car, now that isn't your money. Your bf was extremely generous but that was a down payment he was sending, not open ended gift.", "Yep, you lied and stole his money, that makes YTA. He loaned you the money because he presumably assumed you couldn\u2019t afford a newer car without his help.\n\nAnd then to make matters worse, you\u2019re shitting on his financial knowledge as if that makes this ok. \n\nhE dOeSnT eVeN kNoW wHaT a 401k iS\u2026", "YTA even if it was a good financial decision (I have no idea about that), you misused the funds and hid it from your partner.

Financial Advisor here, under no circumstances would I ever recommend for someone who is already $110k in debt, and planning to double that in the near future, to purchase a car well above their means as OP has done here. \n\nYour boyfriend gave you the $10k specifically so that you would spend the same amount of money you were planning previously ($15-20k) and get a safer car, it was not a $10k free for all gift. I guarantee that the interest you\u2019re paying on your student loans and the car loan is higher than the return you\u2019re making on the investments you made, especially in this market, so your excuse about being more financially savvy doesn\u2019t work here either. \n\nYou\u2019re incredibly selfish and financially irresponsible, your boyfriend should get out while he can.", "YTA - This was very dishonest of you.", "Wow you are a thief, a liar and a coward. Exactly who we want in the medical field. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou suuuuuck", "I would absolutely break up with you over this. \n\nYTA", "Please update us when his \"cold shoulder\" turns into breaking up with you. He deserves way better than a unethical, untrusting, lying girlfriend.", "You could always sell your Rolex if you are in such dire financial straits. But why would you do that when you have a sugar daddy? It\u2019s all about you, isn\u2019t it?", "YTA if you didn't need the money you shouldn't have accepted it. I'd be fuming if I was your partner and demanding the money back. He only gave it you because he thought you needed it.", "Ok, YTA because you basically stole money from him. At the very least you\u2019re being dishonest about money, which is a huge relationship killer. \n\nAlso, your financial choices don\u2019t make sense. 15-20k is too much for a used car, straight up, especially when you\u2019re going to have this much school debt. You\u2019re probably using PLUS loans too, which will accumulate interest once the federal freeze ends. Your interest rate is almost certainly above 3.9%. I hope you have good enough grades to get into dermatology, because if you\u2019re going to primary care route then you will NOT make enough money to live a baller lifestyle and pay back your debt. My fianc\u00e9 is a pediatrician, so I\u2019m pretty familiar with the going salary. \n\nAlso, you invested in a brokerage account instead of paying down your debt. This is stupid because you don\u2019t have an income right now, so you have no other way to pay down your debt. With the market how it is right now, even with relatively safe investments, you will not make enough money on dividends to pay for your car or your loans or whatever. You throw shade at your boyfriend because he doesn\u2019t know about retirement accounts as an excuse to hide your brokerage activity. Brokerage accounts are not tax advantaged and not really comparable to retirement accounts, so that\u2019s not a great comparison. \n\nLastly, I struggle to believe you really know your way around finances either. A \u201cRoth\u201d is just a type of account. I assume you meant Roth IRA v 401k, but the way you wrote that sentence makes it clear that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing very well either. \n\nHope your bf finds someone who doesn\u2019t just use him as an ATM. Good luck on Step 2.", "YTA\n\nIn today's market, why in the world would you invest? Either way, your bf didn't give you the money to invest. He gave you the money to put as a down payment on your car. You didn't have the right to just use it as you wish.", "YTA. Let\u2019s see, you lied to him, hid this from him and he had to find out through a pop up in your phone\u2026 yeah no, if you are still here asking if you\u2019re in the wrong here when it should be pretty obvious.. best luck on this relationship.", "YTA for lying about the finances.  Not a good way to go about a relationship as finances are a huge factor in our lives.", "YTA. He loaned you that large sum of money for a specific purpose. You absolutely do not have the right to use it for a different purpose behind his back.", "YTA.   \nThis isn't about the money. It's about integrity, and you've shown your bf that you have little to none when it comes to money. This is an issue, and you'll probably want to work on that. He trusted you to use the $$ for a car, not to invest in your retirement from which there's a good chance he'll never benefit (because if you can't trust your partner, the relationship is doomed).   \n\n\nAlso, you have no immediacy about the crushing debt you're under. That's got to scare him--you are broke, and instead of minimizing your debt, you're playing with stocks.", "Yeah that\u2019s an easy YTA, he sent the money for one thing and one thing only", "YTA.\n\nYou broke the trust.  You should have asked first.\n\nHe loaned you a lot of money so you could have a reliable car, probably because he was concerned for your safety and ability to get to work on time reliably.  He's a resident himself, and so knows this road already.", "YTA. You misappropriated the money that was meant for a different purpose, abused his generosity, and lied by omission when you did not make sure he was on board with you diverting the funds.", "For him this 10k might of been the best money he ever spent as it\u2019s shown him what kind of person you are. You will never be trusted again and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he is making arrangements to gtfo.", "Wow. Just because you go to medical school doesn\u2019t mean you know common sense. YTA you stole money for a specific purpose, using it for anything other than that purpose is stealing and sounds like fraud.", "Looking at your comments, it seems that this has to be spelled out like you\u2019re 5 years old. \n\nHe gave you the money for a car so your monthly fees aren\u2019t so high. You took that money and used it for something else and then you didn\u2019t tell him about it - that\u2019s lying by omission. He then finds out by seeing your monthly costs are high so you therefore just took 10k from him for nothing. \n\nIf you want to invest money you either get his permission to invest his money or you use yours. You don\u2019t use money that\u2019s specifically for something else and then never say anything about it. \n\nYTA and I can\u2019t believe you need anyone at all to explain this to you.", "Not only are YTA but how are you paying for these car loans if he pays for everything? The point of the down payment is to lower your car payments. \n\nIf OP didn\u2019t put the down payment and invested the whole $10k then where are you getting the money to pay for the car? And how did you not think he wouldn\u2019t find out? He makes the payments the simple math lines up that you didn\u2019t put it where it belongs he was always going to find out. \n\nI think you\u2019ve grown to accustomed to someone else paying for your life (or \u201cinvesting in your future\u201d as you like to put it) If he sticks around long enough to see you become a doctor I hope he does the same back to you ya know \u201cinvesting in his own future\u201d with your money. Maybe you\u2019ll see why this wasn\u2019t okay when he pulls the same thing.", "YTA\n\nYou were given the money for a specific purpose, you used it for something else therefore you stole it.\n\n\"i thought i made a good financial move\" - if you are going to go into fantasy realms of good financial moves surely paying off part of your massive student loan would make more sense", "Yta. How is this even a question? You're a liar. He gave you TEN THOUSAND dollars and you LIED about what you did with it? Even if the decision you made is beneficial to both of your futures, you are still deceitful and wrong.", "YTA. He gave you money understanding that you would use it for the car and then you used it for something else. 10k is a lot. Personally I\u2019d break up and press charges over something like that. Even if he\u2019s not going to do that, your dishonest actions have shown him he is in a relationship with a dishonest person. Of course he\u2019s giving you the cold shoulder.", "I wouldn't go with YTA, but registering it as my vote anyway. Are you a bad person and criminal, yes, asshole imply at least a level of ignorance for me, but you just knowingly and willingly committed fraud against your BF who was being kind. \n\nI meen yea, taking a strangers kindness and extorting it is kinda expected, but a loved one is a little far, even by US standards.", "Uh, yeah. YTA. Misusing funds is called fraud. If you borrowed money from a lender to buy a car but decided to use it for other stuff, and the lender found out, you could be in some deep shit. \n\nGod I hope you\u2019re required to take an ethos course or two with your medical degree.", "YTA- I have a feeling you just caused the death of your relationship. What you did will 100% shake his trust in you.", "YTA and your actions are very unethical. I pray I never have to be a patient of yours.", "YTA. Don't they teach ethics in medical school? This seems pretty obvious.", "YTA", "YTA Why did you not tell him what you were doing? Because you knew it wasn't want he wanted? He is a grown man who is entitled to decide how to spend his money. Spending \u00a310k to avoid 3.9% APR charges probably seemed like a good investment seeing as it is guaranteed. If you are borrowing money at that rate to invest, you better make damn sure you know what is best to invest, because you could make a loss in the current climate.", "YTA", "Yea YTA. He gave you a very large chunk of money to help you but a car, not to buy stocks. You completely broke the trust he had in you. This was something you most definitely should of told him, or should if not taken his money if you didn\u2019t want to you it for the purpose intended. I suggest finding a way to pay him back!", "YTA. You look down on him (\u201dhe wasn\u2019t gonna understand\u2026he doesn\u2019t even know\u201d). And you lied about a lot of money to an intimate partner. I wouldn\u2019t trust you again. For me that would be the end of the relationship - because of a lie of that magnitude, the long-term continued subterfuge, and the condescending attitude you use to justify it.", "YTA. He gave you money for a specific purpose and you used the money for something else, didn't tell him at the time, and got caught. Yes, he hasn't asked for the money back, but since you don't need the money for it's original purpose, you need to give him the money back to make this right. \n\nAnd maybe buy your BF a book about retirement.", "YTA.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he gave you money for the money for electricity bills and you instead spent it all on a new dress and a pair of shoes, it would be the same.", "Why ask for people\u2019s opinions if you\u2019re just going to argue the point? YTA he offered you the down payment and instead you build an investment portfolio, if you\u2019re so confident that you did nothing wrong then why didn\u2019t you tell him what you were actually doing with it?", "Op why did you post here if all you\u2019re going to do is argue with everyone\u2019s opinion? You keep reiterating the same thing \u201che hasn\u2019t asked for it\u201d maybe just GIVE IT BACK and tell him you\u2019re sorry. If you had money and extra jobs and enough leftover to consider investing that you should\u2019ve said something before he even gave you the money. YTA", "You're an AH for lying to your boyfriend. Also, your strategy of borrowing the $10k for 3.9% and putting it into the market doesn't make much sense given the declines in the market.  The money you borrowed is now likely now worth only $7 - $8k now...", "YTA. He gave you money for one thing, and you spent in on another without even discussing it with him. Of course, he is upset, you just violated his trust. Why exactly couldn't you sit down with him and try to discuss what you thought were the best options for that money?", "Yta\n\nAt least they learnt not to give you more money for x, as you will use ut for something else", "You're absolutely the AH and I hope he never helps you financially again, this would be a deal breaker for me because trust would be gone.", " Without a doubt YTA: \n\n He gave you the 10k (a very generous amount and offer given your financial circumstances) for a dedicated purpose to make your travel time more practical and instead you put it into stocks that may not even pan out in the long term.

If you didn't need the 10k, you should give it back, not invest it for your own benefit. And you obviously knew it since you didn't tell him.", "YTA.

Given what the stock market has done this year and is projected to do next year, you not only bought more car than you should have, have a huge 30k loan hanging over your head and probably lose half of that 10k in the next year.\n\nEta: now you have an additional $700 a month payment instead of a $475 a month payment. Do you really have the extra $225 a month for the loan or will you be going into more debt or asking him for even more money?

We have been together for 4 years and have lived together since the early days of our relationship until I had to move several states away for medical school.\n\nI currently have $110k on student loans so far since I started and by the time I graduate I probably will have $220k total in loans. I will then have another 6 years of postgrad residency training for which I will be paid roughly $60k-$70k while working min 80 hours a week. My partner is in residency currently making $71k (had $0 loans from med school) and still has 6 years of training left, but he will finish his training a few years ahead of me.\n\nWhen I had to move to a suburban area with limited public transportation options, I looked into buying a car and initially was looking to get a used car within the $15-20k range. He told me to instead buy a newer, more reliable vehicle but as I explained to him I was limited by my loan budget. He then offered to subsidize my car loan payments by giving me downpayment money of $10k.\n\nFast forward to a few months later, the new car got delivered to the dealership and I signed all the paperwork myself. It ended up costing $31k OTD at a good interest rate (i think) at 3.9% over 4 years. I told bf about finalizing the deal and he immediately sent me the $10k. What he didnt know was that I loaned the whole amount and instead put all of the money on a brokerage account and bought some stocks and mutual funds. He found out about my lie when I visited for the holidays and we were in bed one day and saw an email pop up on my phone about the auto pay payment coming up. He realized that the math didnt add up and confronted me about why i never paid the downpayment he gave me. I said it was a bad idea since I got a low auto loan rate and thought he wasnt gonna understand since he\u2019s never cared about investing anyways (he doesnt even know what a 401k or a Roth is).\n\nHe has since then given me the cold shoulder since after Christmas and my family thinks im an AH for lying to him though i thought i made a good financial move.

A lot of doctors suck at things like finance, politics, etc because they literally don't have time to pay attention to such and devote their life to their career.  And it is DEVOTION so if you think things get better ----- get out now and go into business since you're fighting against what so many are telling you trying to defend your decision.
