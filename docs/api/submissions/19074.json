Fucking nasty.", ">NTA - but also stop dating 3rd graders.\n\n3rd graders? \n\nMy kids new how to wipe and wash by the time they started kindergarten!", "Hey, my 3rd grader would be insulted! He washes his hands after using the the bathroom.", "And their phones!!!!! Least cleaned, most used.", "He's one of those \"touching your butt is gay\" guys, isn't he?", "Great now going out in public today. gonna bathe my hands in sanitizer after touching any surface, just in case I somehow come across this ahole. \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e", "For real. My husband actually prefers to jump in a quick shower before we get frisky. And this guy can\u2019t even wash his nasty hands. OP, if you read this, you deserve better.", "Yeah like even if he does wash his hands from here on...this kind of guy prob isn't clean in general. I wouldn't want his unwashed ding-a-ling anywhere near me", "OP, this dude would literally rather that you just keep getting painful infections than to try using soap. A thing they teach you in preschool.", "NTA! JFC It\u2019s stupefyingly easy to google \u201ccan unwashed hands cause UTIs?\u201d\n\nLike, is he asking you to prove your point? He can\u2019t say \u201chuh, okay, let\u2019s take a look at what a doctor might say about this.\u201d\n\nAngst angst angst\n\nI hope he never has to piss blood and then shit his brains out after a series of antibiotics. But if that day ever comes, your schadenfreude will be 100% justified.", "The wisdom in this comment", "I squeezed my knees shut and I\u2019ve got a dick!!!", "UTIs and BV. OP needs to stop letting gross stuff near her at all \ud83d\ude2d", "Omg this comment made me laugh so hard I peeped myself a bit. And then immediately washed my hands. LOL", "I know, this is what I immediately thought. If I found out my husband didn\u2019t wash his hands after pooping, he would never touch me again.", "It makes me want to vomit, quite frankly.", "If this fact alone did not gag me, the final thought of\u2026 what ELSE doesn\u2019t he wash!, did. BLERP!\n\nYou are only in danger of infection and being an A H IF you continue to allow him access to your temple covered in E. coli.\n\nOP, do you really want to be with Poop Hand Luke?   \n\nHe does not respect you. It shows by his slovenly behavior and blatant disregard for your health. He demeans you by Only agreeing to believe REDDIT responses. \n\nOP, you deserve better from a lover. (Please tell me he does Not work in healthcare or food service!)", "The first instance and I'd be out the door.", "I don\u2019t know if everyone understands what a UTI is. I\u2019d had a couple over the years, but they were apparently mild. ONE DAY I got a UTI that had me peeing what looked like straight blood. It was awful. I know exactly who I had sex with the night before and that\u2019s the only possible cause. Fucking disgusting when I hear of women who get REPEATED UTIs from a partner. What the actual fuck?", "It could also be caused by an STI, that btw you cannot catch from a dirty toilet at their scummy workplace. Just saying. (Maybe a little deep seated trauma haha).", "Fr, I saw my boss piss and not wash his hands in the bathroom and I told him that\u2019s disgusting and he shouldn\u2019t be touching anyone or anything. His response was this his dick was as clean as the rest of his body when he took a shower that day\ud83d\udc80", "I don't shake hands with anyone anymore. Fist bumps only.", "NTA, are you seriously considering a long term relationship with this child?", "DTMF!", "I am not sure his dick should have privileges either. Partly on principle, but also partly because - is he washing his dick ever? Or, washing it after touching it with his poopyhands?", "Not to mention gastroenteritis\u2014which can be spread via the fecal-oral route.  Not washing hands after pooping is NASTY", "Mr Feces Feeler", "That was my thought too", "Yup\u2026 after he learns to wash his hands, perhaps the next thing will be to learn colours and shapes. \n\n(Kindergarten teacher\u2019s voice with hand claps) YAY!!", "The bar is obviously in Hell. \n\nI don't care if he looks like Damson Idris. He is INSTANTLY unattractive if he can't be bothered to wash his hands properly.", "For future reference, dicks too can get UTIs so the reaction is even more valid.", "ngl I am proud of both of us for this one", "I agree. I've only ever had a UTI once and it was not pleasant. I don't recommend for anyone to continously put themselves in the position for repeated UTIs from the same cause. OP's partner is nasty and should not be touching her at all. What the actual fuck indeed!", "I\u2019ve gone to the emergency room in so much pain I thought I was dying only to find out the problem was a fucking UTI. If you are someone who has never had to worry about UTIs, please know that they are no joke.", "I agree completely.", "Is that 'dump that motherfucker\"? I'm not OP but I agree.\n\n\nEdit: misspelling.", "I actually gagged reading this. That's the most disgusting way you could've described it", "Pull out the poop knife and just gently scrape the tough spots.", "The bar is in hell & the Devil is currently doing the limbo under it.", "That's a direct quote from a buddy of mine. He broke wind, and it sounded particularly sloppy. So we asked him if he needed to go wipe. Then he hit us with that gem."]}
