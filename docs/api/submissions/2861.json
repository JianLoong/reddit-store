There's no right and wrong in grieving and celebrating her life. While I understand their reluctance towards the story being published, I understand your side too as it is a celebration of her life. And what could be a better celebration than to share the story of how amazing your mother is to others through your writing?I hope your dad and brother can see that you're making sure that her memories will always be alive pouring it into book, that you're making sure not only people that knows her will remember her but also readers that will be touched by her stories.", "Info: Did the two angry with you only found out now that you sent it to a publisher? Or did you let them know before?", "NTA and your father i think isn't intentionally TA here. He is just still grieving and in different pain than you are.", "NTA, but I kind of think no-ones the AH here. You're all dealing with grief and loss and that looks different for everyone.", "When grieving you're always looking for someone to blame for your grief. Keep doing what you're doing.", "NTA. You are not selling your mother's death or her life. You are selling YOUR life experiences. Update us when your book comes out", "NAH.\n\nYou are welcome to publish a semi-autobiographical novel about your mother (and presumably the rest of your family), but they are welcome to feel however they want about it.\n\nYes, this is how a lot of major works were written \u2026 and how a lot of famous authors became estranged from their family and friends.\n\nThree years is not that long, and this is grief that everyone is still processing, which makes this more complicated. Often these things are written, say, 20 years later, when the death feels more like the past than the present. It\u2019s pretty hard to deal with a published book out there when you are still processing the grief.\n\nRather than asking if you are an asshole, think about whether you want to get estranged from family as a result of losing one family member.\n\nEDIT: I would encourage you to read Bad Writer Friends to get a feeling about the level of messiness that can happen with publishing personal and family narratives. It is messy being this type of writer, and you have to really weigh if publishing now is worth what you will invite in.\n\nTry to see what this must feel like for your father, to have a child publish a narrative about his late wife. I\u2019m not naive about the publishing industry, and I know it\u2019s very unlikely that something like \u201cmy mom was an angel and we all miss her\u201d would get picked up - there is usually conflict and drama involved.\n\nI think about Crying in H Mart which is along these lines, and I have to wonder that it must have been very difficult for surviving family with a high-profile conflicted account out there.\n\nI see suggestions out there to wait and/or to change it so much that only the emotional truth remains, but they are absolutely unidentifiable to family and friends, and I think that would be wise.\n\nEDIT 2: I thought about it: I also keep a very intimate journal and yeah I sure as hell would avoid publishing anything based off that in the wake of grief. There\u2019s such thing as too much honesty too soon.", "Nta", "I agree and you never know how this book could help someone else. Maybe using a portion of the proceeds to set up a foundation or making a donation to a charity your mom cared about could help the family come around. It could be a nice way to honor her", "Thank you very much for your answer, I think I needed something like this. I just want to say that actually there is a lot of drama involved, but it is mostly about me and my mother. It's mostly about how I got in a lot of troubles (some of them serious), and my mum stayed with me, even when I was a very difficult teenager. Then she publicly defended me against the neighbours when I got out of the closet (where I live, not being straight is not illegal, but still a social problem). I tried to keep the rest of the family out of the book while possible. Obviously, it was not always possible.\n\nI have to think about it a bit more and speak to them. I would want them to read the final version of the book and tell me exactly what things they want me to remove or rewrite, but they don't want, and I can't blame them.", "They read the first draft (before I was thinking of publishing it, it was way different back then), and they refuse to read the new version, even when I'm actively trying them to, so they can tell me exactly which parts they feel less comfortable about and I should remove.", "I\u2019m a mom and writer. \n\nIf I dropped dead I would be aware that one family member publishing a highly intimate and public account of the family would probably tear the family apart, and I wouldn\u2019t want to leave that behind.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason that many writers destroyed their correspondence, diaries, etc.  with impending death, or had a trusted person destroy everything. It can be nice to have mementos and memories, but they can also wound deeply.", "I told them my intentions before sending it to the publishers, and they didn't like it but never told me anything until a publisher answered positively. I think they believed I wouldn't be able to publish it.", "Informing them before sending it means you had it finished and ready to go already? ESH honestly. They are overreacting, especially when you changed the names and all. But if you already had it finished there wasn't much they could do but hope it wouldn't get published. It's a weird situation because your way of grieving is obviously different and to them it probably feels like you carry their story all out for the world to see. If you would have asked them before writing they might have been more open to it. Maybe sit down with them and try to explain again?", ">But if you already had it finished there wasn't much they could do \n\nI am a writer and this is weird. Writing is what we do. We don't beg permission to write. You just write. Your inspiration is your inspiration.\n\n>If you would have asked them before writing they might have been more open to it.\n\nAgain, why? Was it not his experience too. What if he wanted to write about this childhood, does he needs to run it by his father too? If he wants, okay but it is his experience. \n\n>Maybe sit down with them and try to explain again?\n\nExplain what?", "Yeah sorry but it's not just her story. And the father and brother maybe don't want the mother's story dragged around the world and that's understandable. So OP literally gives no f about their feelings and just did what she felt was right. She went \"Here I wrote this book about mom and will publish it\". She easily could have told them in advance that she plans to write a book about her relationship with mom, what do they think about it. She didn't. Hence OP sucks too.

Good luck with the book  :)", "NAH\n\nI've had a character based on me, and a lot of my family's history is out there in a very identifiable manner, some of it talking about some dark and private stuff.\n\nEven when it's not identifying it can be really uncomfortable reading something based on you or someone you care about. Disconcerting, embarrassing, exposing. \n\nIt's your grief and your story and you have a right to tell it, but they can definitely feel it's invasive and their story also. Add in grief and tempers can run a bit high for reasonable people too. \n\nCan you give it a bit of time and chat to them again? Talk about how it's your way to honor your mum, and keep another part of her alive? Ask if there is anything that particularly upsets them. Listen, and try to see a bit their perspective.
