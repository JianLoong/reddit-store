You are selling a book based on the experience you had when your mother died.\n\nIf you feel bad about, change it some more. There's no downside to that - it never hurts to make another version of a book - quite the opposite.

Pouring you heart out onto a page is nothing to be ashamed of, you aren't *selling the life of your mother*, you're telling the story of her life and how it helped you become the person you are today.

And sorry for your loss.\n\nI can understand your brother and father being a bit upset, especially if they didn't know you'd be writing it and the announcement came out of the blue. \n\nBut the reality is that you're not \"making money from your mother's death\" - you're celebrating your life and your experiences with your mother. And it's your way of dealing with the loss of a loved one.\n\nIf it gets picked up by a publisher, it could become a book that helps future generations deal with the loss of loved ones - which is a great and powerful thing. \n\nHave your father and brother (the one angry with you) read the book at all? \n\nMaybe they don't understand /realise the full context of your writing. They might think it's just a story that \"abuses\" your mother's memory. But if they read it and realised it's from your perspective and shows the emotions and experiences you had with your mother and your way of expressing your grief, then maybe (just maybe) they'd understand and be more supportive.", "Nta but they might still be grieving and they are expressing it by blaming you for selling", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's no right and wrong in grieving and celebrating her life. While I understand their reluctance towards the story being published, I understand your side too as it is a celebration of her life. And what could be a better celebration than to share the story of how amazing your mother is to others through your writing?I hope your dad and brother can see that you're making sure that her memories will always be alive pouring it into book, that you're making sure not only people that knows her will remember her but also readers that will be touched by her stories.", "Info: Did the two angry with you only found out now that you sent it to a publisher?
