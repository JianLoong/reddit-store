How is your son suppose to ever relax or feel comfortable with someone he has to call Sir all the time?", "NTA \n\nSomething important to acknowledge here is that regardless of anyone\u2019s intent in agreeing to this arrangement, Grant and mom are creating an even greater power imbalance in their home than already exists in the dynamics of children/adult and parent/child.  Now there\u2019s 3 kids living in the house who call their father \u201cdad\u201d and according to comment it looks like they refer to ex wife by her name. So they all address both of your familiarly and intimately, which fosters the relationship between everyone. Then there\u2019s 1 child living there who must refer to Grant as \u201csir\u201d at all times unless he decides he\u2019s comfortable calling him dad. There\u2019s zero intimacy or familiarity in this dynamic and as a step child myself, it would definitely not make me feel that my step dad was trying to create any kind of genuine familial connection with me. Regardless of anyone\u2019s intent, it defaults your son as an \u201cother\u201d in their home. \n\nThen there\u2019s the double standard in the home. Either Grant believes that 1) his wife as an individual doesn\u2019t deserve to be respected by his children for some reason and he\u2019s fine with them blatantly disrespecting her each time they address her, or 2) he is the sole authority in the home, the one in charge, and his new wife is just another person in the home who should submit to him. Either way he\u2019d made it clear he does not see his wife as his equal to some degree. \n\nI\u2019d be curious to ask you son if he really feels okay with this dynamic and it really works for him, or if it\u2019s just easier than trying to come up with an alternative that Grant feels is \u201crespectful\u201d enough to answer to. He\u2019s flaunting his authority and tailoring his home environment to feed his ego. Plus the longer the situation stands, the weirder it is. Ten years from now when he\u2019s an adult living on his own will he still be forced to say \u201cmom and sir\u201d when he talks about his family? Your son may not be offended by it or uncomfortable right now, buts it\u2019s almost a guarantee that he will never see Grant as family or feel like he is family to Grant in the future. And quite possibly Grant\u2019s children by extension, especially because your son is the youngest of them all and with what they\u2019ve been taught by their dad it\u2019s very possible they see themselves \u201chigher\u201d in status in the home than he is. But of course that is all speculation. \n\nHaving said all this, I\u2019ll also say don\u2019t let yourself become the asshole. Having the feelings that you have and regularly checking in with your son on his new home dynamic and his feelings about it does not make you an asshole. Escalating a situation that all/other involved parties jointly attempt to deescalate, or even just ignore, could make you an asshole. Especially if your son is just trying to keep the peace by accepting the rule and he ends up seeing you as the one who disrupted the peace, regardless of your good intentions. Because your son is the one that will deal with the consequences of however you choose to handle this situation and it could very easily turn into Grant saying \u201cyou can run to your dad for every little thing, this is my house, my rules, etc\u201d and then somehow your son will still end up being the disrespectful one for discussing this with you, even if he isn\u2019t the one who brought it up in the first place. \n\nIdk I\u2019m obviously can\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on in everyone\u2019s heads and hearts here, but I know this makes me feel squicky thinking about it in terms of me and my step father. He\u2019s always felt like an always-present authority I had to submit to, like he owned and ran the home and I just lived there. I counted the years and months until I could move out. I visit very little now and my relationship with my mother has unquestionably suffered because of the new home dynamic introduced when she married her husband. I don\u2019t feel like she\u2019ll stick up for me or take my side when necessary because I\u2019ve watched her submit to him for the last 15 years, stay quiet and out of the way when he\u2019s clearly in the wrong, and basically let him dictate what their beliefs are. If shes never taken up for herself l\u2019ll never feel confident that she\u2019ll take up for me. That\u2019s very possibly the future your ex wife is looking at if this \u201cfamily\u201d dynamic keeps up. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your son is in this situation right now, he sounds like a cool and kind kid.", "Soft AH...your son is 13-years old living under another roof.

That's what her husband, friends, or coworkers call her - her peers. But we are not peers. She literally *created* me. That is a unique relationship. Nobody else on the whole planet can call her \"mom\" - that is reserved for me alone. So why would I even want to call her by her first name? To do so would be to purposely drop an intimate title only I am even *allowed* to use - I can see why it would offend her. Mind you, this type of thing isn't just with parents, either. I almost never refer to my own wife by her name, or vice versa. At the end of the day, the only purpose of a given name is to distinguish you from other people. But there are some relationships in life that are deeper than that, where only your title or pet-name reflect the true familiarity you have.\n\nThat said, my stepdad came into my life when I was already a teenager.

I certainly admire him and love him, and he proved to be a wonderful father, but the way we refer to each other became habit early on. Given my distaste for \"dad\" and the fact that my wife and I are infertile, I will likely have my adopted children call me by my first name as well.

I would agree that imposing a title against someone else's will (say, if the stepdad insisted on being called \"dad\") is clearly uncool, but I admit that I'm bothered if my wife calls me by my name in private - that usually means we're in an argument because it represents a conscious decision to drop the more intimate, familiar titles and start going by our given names.

Basically where I live, Sir is a word not just to be polite and respectful but used by someone debasing themselves as lesser than whom they are speaking to.

They're not friends nor family so why act in a personal manner? Also, can be quite sensitive as it's been a racist action for whites to call minorities by their first name without hesitation. Making those treated like children or lower caste, not a comparable peer. Reason why many in the black community gave their children 'Duke', 'Count' names to get that respect.\n\nI was raised as well as many from certain families & regions believing in showing respect by using sir, ma'am or even *Miss* 'lady's name' (Miss Irene).\n\nNo one would ever consider calling their parents by their first name. There are many that do, can't argue that for them it's not okay. Typically, it's the upper-middle-class liberals who could be different in raising their children as their friends/equals.\n\nRationale for the respect is that they aren't older friends, but rather the parents who created them, saw them naked as an infant, & potty trained them, then monitored their safety & reckless thinking until they were able to fend for themselves. Even older people (elders) should be given respect & recognized for their age not called by their first names unless given permission.\n\n**2nd Part:**\n\nIDK based on the description we have no knowledge of how the household dynamic consistently is. If son confided in him, he wasn't comfortable or felt like an outcast I'd be chomping at the bit to do something. Son stated \"he does not have a problem with it at all\". Why push it?\n\nIs it abusive? Is it a scenario from the movie 'The Great Santini'? That's the key that not only would the stepfather be a strict disciplinarian but abuses the power. We don't know that only that he wants the stepson to call him sir. Explanation was it wasn't 'dad' or form of, but rather used for him to respect & still define who he's talking to or about. What's the harm?\n\nNor do we know about OP & his style of parenting along with personality. Is he the type that is rebellious & is anti-establishment? Does he prefer his son have no strict guidelines & be whatever he feels he wants to do? Does he not know about the use of sir as respect? I don't know that either.\n\nWhat I do know is that unless he has a solution, he's asking them to remove this without giving an alternative. Son shouldn't be calling Grant dad, daddy, father or any form if not comfortable with doing so. Shouldn't be calling him by his first name as he's not a peer but an underaged minor.\n\nDad is projecting something he's unaware of onto his son. Whether or not he likes this 2nd husband Grant. The minute he stated his son was more respectful and disciplined I knew it was more than that. It's about control & being involved more in son's life. Arguing over whether or not use a respectful term because he doesn't like its use is more about concerns of control than ignorance of respectful terms.", "I find it very strange.
