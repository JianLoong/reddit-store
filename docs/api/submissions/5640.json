They didn't want to pressure Eric into calling Grant dad or something like that, so generally calling him \"Sir\" in a respectful manner was the solution.\n\nI said that this must stop.

You stated that you son is ok with this so just let it go. Have you ever consider that maybe your son likes to call him sr because is not forcing any kid of proximity but is just a respectful way of referring to him? Don\u2019t barge into something that is not your business. If your son and his stepdad decides that they want to call/be called something else is up to them! \n\nBy the way, I always referred to my parents as sir and ma\u2019am. I love them, they love me and it\u2019s just a polite way to talk to older people, specially those who we are not that intimate to be calling by their first name.", "YTA. Your son made it clear that he doesn't mind it at all so why are you so torqued up over it? Would you rather force your son to be uncomfortable and call him Dad?  \n\nGrant's not comfortable having kids call him by I his first name so he and your son came up with a solution they're both comfortable with. Why is that bad?", "YTA.\n\nThis is not something that is harmful to your son, and you do not have control over parenting decisions made by your ex wife or by his step-dad. \"Sir\" is a totally normal way to refer to an adult in a position of authority or responsibility.\n\nYou do sound like you are being extremely annoying about this.", "YTA. Everyone seems fine with it but you. You said your son is now being \u2018respectful and disciplined\u2019 - oh what a tragedy! Out of curiosity\u2026what would you like your son to call his stepdad? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s something super respectful, right?", "NTA \u201csir\u201d etc. belongs in the dark ages. It\u2019s like the son so below on status that a title is required like he is  a servant. \n\nStep dad only demands it for himself like he\u2019s the rulers. Yuck.", "YTA. If your son is completely fine with it, leave it be. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it.", "YTA.\n\n\nSeems like your wife, her husband, and your son came up with their own compromise.

So your son is perfectly fine showing respect to an older adult male figure, and you have a problem with that? Grow up.

Never thought I would ever hear or read about a parent having an issue with their child being respectful and disciplined. Why should you have say in what your sim calls his stepfather.

It's good that you can talk to your son about this sort of stuff, keep doing that", "YTA. if your son doesn't have a problem with this compromise, it doesn't matter what you think. Also, many parents raise their kids to respond to all adults as ma'am and sir. It's hard trying to combine families. Stop trying to make it harder.", "YTA.  Your son has no issues with it and he is not being treated any differently than Grants birth children in this case. However, this would be a huge red flag to me as people who insist children respect adults by calling them sir often have no qualms about \u2018discipline\u2019, physical and emotional, that is really abuse.", "Let me get this straight.

Your opinion doesn't matter, your son's opinion does.

There is nothing wrong with this. You yourself said your son has no problem with calling your wife's new husband sir.

I personally think you are attemoting to make something out of nothing.", "Do y\u2019all live in the south? Is he from the South? Have a military background? \n\nMy husband was born and raised in Charleston, SC where we met. Sir and ma\u2019am we\u2019re expected. (You could also use Ms./Miss in certain circumstances.) \n\nWhen we moved to northern states ppl acted like my kids were plotting their deaths when they said it. It drive me crazy bc those were the standards WE set for our kids and ppl were actively telling them not to do that. Don\u2019t undermine what other ppl expect of their kids. I\u2019d hear my kids call an adult by their first name, they\u2019d get yelled at by us, but they were told to do that by the adult. Terms of respect can be regional/cultural. \n\nThe percussion director for my 13 yr old insists on being called by his first name. I absolutely refuse and make my 13 yr old call him Mr. First Name. It\u2019s just not appropriate to call an adult in a position of power over you by their first name- it\u2019s not. \n\nI honestly still cringe when kids call me by my first name and don\u2019t put Miss in front of it. I don\u2019t say anything bc that\u2019s how they were raised but I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s my problem, not theirs. \n\nYour son is OK with it, that\u2019s what that house requires, and I\u2019m willing to bet the bio-kids use it, too, even if you haven\u2019t seen it. My kids still use it with us- and we use it with them. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am!\u201d is something I find myself saying a lot. ;) \n\nI\u2019d have a talk with your son. Tell him if it ever makes him uncomfortable then he can tell you about it and you can advocate for him. I\u2019d also put him and yourself in therapy to help navigate this big change in both y\u2019all\u2019s life bc it sounds like it\u2019s hard for everyone. \n\nESH bc it\u2019s so normal to some but others see it as a big deal. You can\u2019t win here so go with it as long as your son is OK with it.", "YTA. You dont get to dictate to your ex what the kids call her new bf. Or new husband. That\u2019s overstepping. Only exception if they\u2019re forcing them to say mom or dad since that\u2019s purely up to the kid. But theres no harm in this.

Your son told you he doesn't have an issue with it.", "NAH, but if your son has no problem with it I'd leave it alone", "nta.  I would not be thrilled with this.  Grant has a name, he can be called Grant.  He is not above your son simply because he is an adult.", "YTA. Not your house, not your rules. If you didn't want your son being partly raised by another man, in his house, with his rules, I guess you shouldn't have gotten divorced.", "Considering so many step parents forcing relationships too soon on kids having your son call step Dad \u201c sir\u201d sounds like a minor issue. Kid is ok with it and not complaining, maybe Dad has authority issues and is projecting on son.  Leave kid navigate his own relationships with step family and quit being the AH. You are making problems were there are no problems.", "Nobody is an asshole. Grant doesn't allow his own children to call him by his first name, likely preferring Dad or father, so it would be odd for him to allow his new stepchild to do that. Sir may be a bit awkward, but it is a compromise: Grant doesn't have to let a kid call him by his first name (something many people find disrespectful, I would absolutely never call my mother by her first name) and your son doesn't have to call him \"Dad\". I think you may just be a bit sensitive here, but your son clearly isn't bothered by it so I wouldn't worry over it.", "OP says his son has never been this respectful and disciplined before and because the step dad, who isn\u2019t forcing ops son to call him dad or father, won\u2019t allow him to address him by his first name, you presume he\u2019s an anal retentive AH. Op also states that calling him sir was the solution which sounds like it was agreed upon by all except op. Additionally, ops the only one with an issue about it.", "How is he an anal retentive jerk?", "I remember my mum telling me about a teacher asking to be called sir instead of his name when she was in high school(British in 1970's) and her mum told him that unless he had been knighted by the queen, he was not a sir and would be called Mr ........... because he would not feed his self importance using her child.\n\nIf he doesn't want the child to call him his first name but wants child to respectful then child should call him Mr..........\n\nSir sounds like an employee to their boss", "Seriously! Being addressed in a respectful manner that they all agreed to could be an issue later. Super-Authority figure? Dude won\u2019t let his kids call him by his first name and isn\u2019t showing preference to his step son. Op also states his sim has never been as respectful and disciplined as he is right now. Again, never though someone would complain about a kids having structure and discipline in their life. Your assumption of him being a super authority figure and how calling him \u201cSir\u201d could be a precedent for red flags is something else. Only person with an issue is Op", "No", "Well of course the son doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, because Mister wouldn\u2019t like that. \n\nI always referred to my stepdad as Sir. Yes, sir. I understand, sir. I\u2019m sorry, sir. \n\nDid I ever protest? Of course not. Who am I to protest? I am just a little boy, powerless and weak. One day, I will be Sir. But for now, I sit and I listen. I nod and I say \u201cyes sir\u201d. \n\nI understand I am biased. But simply \u201cbelieving\u201d kids are okay with those who have authority over them is madness, no? \n\nThe people with authority are purposefully constructing language such that those beneath them are always aware of their authority. And you truly believe the son is silent out of joy, and not compliance?", "YTA\n\nIf the son had a problem then of course back up your son. But he seems fine. I live in an area where kids will sometimes sir/ma\u2019am for their parents depending on the convo. Not a big deal.", "Right? Everyone is fine with it except OP.", "Surely if someone insists/asks you to just use their first name, then ignoring that and deciding you know better is significantly more rude and inappropriate? Adding a Mr/Miss isn't a sign of respect if doing so actively disrespects a direct request from the person involved.", "I'm not calling the stepfather an AH. I'm calling him dour. There's quite a difference.", "I wouldn't feel comfortable at all with my own kids calling me so stiffly. I would in fact feel horrible.", "I think everyone's mileage is gonna vary a LOT here depending on how formal their day to day environment is.\n\nMine growing up was pretty informal, us kids were calling all of our aunts and uncles by  first name (no aunt so and so, just first names) and used informal pronouns with them. Ditto our parent's adults friends.\n\nThe mere fact the stepdad has a problem with a child of the family calling him by his first name would have raised a few eyebrows. Because dude, what's the big deal?\n\nBut the wanting to be called \"sir\" instead? That would have come off as either a massive power trip or as a massive rejection\\* of the stepchild, or both.\n\n\\*There are two components to formal form of addresses. One is rankings, and yeah, \"sir\" is appropriate for an authority figure, but another is how close you are to the person. In my neck of the wood, \"sir\" is for strangers and maybe your bosses if you're in a more formal field, not relatives.", "Apparently, you are getting downvoted by people who don't like their children being taught manners. My grandfather was in the military and he raised my father and uncles to be respectful of their elders within reason, so that's hiw my father and uncles raised their kids. Calling people \"sir\" and \"ma'am\" is NOT a red flag, UNLESS Eric was getting singled out. It sounds like \"sir\" was just a happy medium since the stepdad didn't want to impose a \"dad\" label onto Eric.", "In that case, tentatively NTA. How much do you know about Grant's character? Is he one those sorry excuses of a man that gets a kick out of being deferred to by a much younger wife and her son? If he were actually interested in respect as a general matter, you would think he would have told his own children to show his wife the same courtesy that he expects from her son. And if she had had any forethought about making some semblance of equilibrium in their house, she would have insisted on it. And suppose your son is comfortable calling Grant sir, he would definitely not be an AH if he told Grant to call him sir back.", "Do his kids call him \"Sir\"?  Does his new wife?", "Either way your knocking the step dad for what? Not letting the kid call him by his first name? Not forcing him to call him dad? Coming up with an agreeable solution that only the op has an issue with? I mean you can call him what you want, it\u2019s your opinion, just seems little off to me. Cheers!", "Well the child here doesn\u2019t mind and neither does his mother. I\u2019m sure if the child\nFelt horrible this would be a different conversation", "I know several parents who raise their kids to call all adults ma'am or sir.", "In many cultures calling someone older than you by their first name is considered incredibly rude. I would never call my mom by her first name and I call her husband uncle (what I would\u2019ve called him if they weren\u2019t married anyway)", "Yeah, but this is a compromise where he doesn't have to submit to a child calling him by his first name (something many parents considered disrespectful, including mine) while also not expecting the kid to start calling him Dad. I'm not saying the tradition of referring to your parents solely by their parental title isn't a mostly obsolete holdover from a more formal time, but the practice is still very much alive. At the end of the day, as long as the kid isn't bothered then the dad should chill out.", "It sounds like his kids call him dad (or some version of it). The stepson is calling him sir because their relationship doesnt merit the title of dad hut he also doesn't want to be on a first name basis with the kid.", "I was raised the same way, along with \"please\" and \"thank you\" and other basic manners. To me it just seems like common courtesy, and I'm going to sound old af right now (im in my ewely 30s), but there are a lot of kids that could use a dose of manners."]}
