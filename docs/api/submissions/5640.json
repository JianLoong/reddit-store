How is your son suppose to ever relax or feel comfortable with someone he has to call Sir all the time?", "NTA \n\nSomething important to acknowledge here is that regardless of anyone\u2019s intent in agreeing to this arrangement, Grant and mom are creating an even greater power imbalance in their home than already exists in the dynamics of children/adult and parent/child.  Now there\u2019s 3 kids living in the house who call their father \u201cdad\u201d and according to comment it looks like they refer to ex wife by her name. So they all address both of your familiarly and intimately, which fosters the relationship between everyone. Then there\u2019s 1 child living there who must refer to Grant as \u201csir\u201d at all times unless he decides he\u2019s comfortable calling him dad. There\u2019s zero intimacy or familiarity in this dynamic and as a step child myself, it would definitely not make me feel that my step dad was trying to create any kind of genuine familial connection with me. Regardless of anyone\u2019s intent, it defaults your son as an \u201cother\u201d in their home. \n\nThen there\u2019s the double standard in the home. Either Grant believes that 1) his wife as an individual doesn\u2019t deserve to be respected by his children for some reason and he\u2019s fine with them blatantly disrespecting her each time they address her, or 2) he is the sole authority in the home, the one in charge, and his new wife is just another person in the home who should submit to him. Either way he\u2019d made it clear he does not see his wife as his equal to some degree. \n\nI\u2019d be curious to ask you son if he really feels okay with this dynamic and it really works for him, or if it\u2019s just easier than trying to come up with an alternative that Grant feels is \u201crespectful\u201d enough to answer to. He\u2019s flaunting his authority and tailoring his home environment to feed his ego. Plus the longer the situation stands, the weirder it is. Ten years from now when he\u2019s an adult living on his own will he still be forced to say \u201cmom and sir\u201d when he talks about his family? Your son may not be offended by it or uncomfortable right now, buts it\u2019s almost a guarantee that he will never see Grant as family or feel like he is family to Grant in the future. And quite possibly Grant\u2019s children by extension, especially because your son is the youngest of them all and with what they\u2019ve been taught by their dad it\u2019s very possible they see themselves \u201chigher\u201d in status in the home than he is. But of course that is all speculation. \n\nHaving said all this, I\u2019ll also say don\u2019t let yourself become the asshole. Having the feelings that you have and regularly checking in with your son on his new home dynamic and his feelings about it does not make you an asshole. Escalating a situation that all/other involved parties jointly attempt to deescalate, or even just ignore, could make you an asshole. Especially if your son is just trying to keep the peace by accepting the rule and he ends up seeing you as the one who disrupted the peace, regardless of your good intentions. Because your son is the one that will deal with the consequences of however you choose to handle this situation and it could very easily turn into Grant saying \u201cyou can run to your dad for every little thing, this is my house, my rules, etc\u201d and then somehow your son will still end up being the disrespectful one for discussing this with you, even if he isn\u2019t the one who brought it up in the first place. \n\nIdk I\u2019m obviously can\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on in everyone\u2019s heads and hearts here, but I know this makes me feel squicky thinking about it in terms of me and my step father. He\u2019s always felt like an always-present authority I had to submit to, like he owned and ran the home and I just lived there. I counted the years and months until I could move out. I visit very little now and my relationship with my mother has unquestionably suffered because of the new home dynamic introduced when she married her husband. I don\u2019t feel like she\u2019ll stick up for me or take my side when necessary because I\u2019ve watched her submit to him for the last 15 years, stay quiet and out of the way when he\u2019s clearly in the wrong, and basically let him dictate what their beliefs are. If shes never taken up for herself l\u2019ll never feel confident that she\u2019ll take up for me. That\u2019s very possibly the future your ex wife is looking at if this \u201cfamily\u201d dynamic keeps up. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your son is in this situation right now, he sounds like a cool and kind kid.", "Soft AH...your son is 13-years old living under another roof.

That's what her husband, friends, or coworkers call her - her peers. But we are not peers. She literally *created* me. That is a unique relationship. Nobody else on the whole planet can call her \"mom\" - that is reserved for me alone. So why would I even want to call her by her first name? To do so would be to purposely drop an intimate title only I am even *allowed* to use - I can see why it would offend her. Mind you, this type of thing isn't just with parents, either. I almost never refer to my own wife by her name, or vice versa. At the end of the day, the only purpose of a given name is to distinguish you from other people. But there are some relationships in life that are deeper than that, where only your title or pet-name reflect the true familiarity you have.\n\nThat said, my stepdad came into my life when I was already a teenager.

I certainly admire him and love him, and he proved to be a wonderful father, but the way we refer to each other became habit early on. Given my distaste for \"dad\" and the fact that my wife and I are infertile, I will likely have my adopted children call me by my first name as well.

I would agree that imposing a title against someone else's will (say, if the stepdad insisted on being called \"dad\") is clearly uncool, but I admit that I'm bothered if my wife calls me by my name in private - that usually means we're in an argument because it represents a conscious decision to drop the more intimate, familiar titles and start going by our given names.

What I think you fail to recognize is that just because you have experience that gives the word \"sir\" a very specific context, doesn't mean it's that way for everybody else. Just look through these comments. Most AITA posts are all YTA or NTA, but this one is far more mixed because different people feel differently about the term. I, as a civilian through and through, don't see the term \"sir\" as anything more than common respect. I call my stepdad \"sir\" if he asks me to do something, I call customers at work \"sir\" when greeting them, and I say \" pardon me, sir\" if I bump another man on the street. I see the word no differently than I do \"ma'am\", which I also use in all those same circumstances for women.", "Where do you live that children get to decide what they call the adults in their lives? Were you calling teachers by their first names when you were a child? Your elderly neighbors?", "I mean\u2026 it\u2019s established by at least his mom that his stepdad is an authority figure. Idk where you\u2019re getting that he just stomped in and demanded the kid call him sir or else. It says the mom and stepdad recently got married, but we have no idea how long they\u2019ve been together or how long he\u2019s been around them. So it\u2019s a pretty big assumption that he\u2019s just some stranger demanding to be called sir.", "Fair enough! Some people are more formal than my family I suppose so that might just be my upbringing.\n\nSame to you!", "Well, I call my mother \"Mum\", my aunts \"Aunt (name)\". Different ways of being respectful and loving.", "It\u2019s cultural. I moved south at 23 and learned to say \u201csir?\u201d or \u201cma\u2019am?\u201c instead of \u201cwhat?\u201d when I hadn\u2019t heard someone. \u201cYes/no sir/ma\u2019am\u201d is expected when in direct conversation as well.", "I don't know if it makes it better or worse to you, but I have heard my sister (who lives in Alabama where sir/ma'am are absolutely required) say it back to her kids, not every time, but sometimes. \"Mama, may I have a ___?\" \"Yes, ma'am, you sure can.\"\n\nIt's just a cultural thing in the south. I live in Texas, so it's kind of borderline here. Some families teach it, others don't, so in public people don't get too offended either way.", "What did they call their teachers then? Just their last names or? I just used their first names when I grew up", "As a Canadian, do you say \u201cthe South\u201d to refer to all of the USA?", "Yup.", "Yeah I think without knowing for sure that the son is okay with calling him sir, it's hard to make a judgment. Stepparents always make the dynamics a little trickier.", "I\u2019m sorry you interpreted that as a blanket statement. I thought the context was obvious considering the conversation, but I digress. \n\nYou missed my last point, which is the important one. If you asked a private whether he was comfortable with calling his authority Sir, of course he will say yes. Undoubtedly. \n\nBut, perhaps, the power dynamics fuel that answer. You get what I mean? \n\nThe son has a rule set in place that he must call his step dad sir. Not step dad, not first name, sir, that is the rule. \n\nAre we really shocked the kid says \u201cyeah I\u2019m okay with the rule\u201d? Not to mention\u2026 what kind of person would set such a rule? \n\nDo you think a person who would set such a rule would be peachy with people questioning them? \n\nI, for one, would NEVER set such a rule for a step kid. Nobody I can think of would either. These are things we have to consider.", "Can confirm I was raised in a more formal family. It's wild how many cultural differences there can be even within the same general population. So, it sounds as though we can agree on that at least \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Oh, totally. It\u2019s definitely a southern US thing. My husband is from the Northwest and thinks it\u2019s absolutely crazy that I ask our kids to call us \u201cma\u2019am\u201d and \u201csir.\u201d Didn\u2019t mean to imply that using \u201cma\u2019am\u201d and \u201csir\u201d is the only way to be respectful\u2014just building on the comment of the previous commenter who made the 7-11 clerk point about how southerners call literally everyone \u201csir.\u201d", "I don't mean that they wouldn't call them by their honorific and name (Mr. Johnson) but that a teacher would ask a student to do something and the student would not respond \"yes, sir\", which I found very different to my school in Florida.", "I mean the dad, who clearly doesn't like it, directly asked the son how he felt about it and he said he has no issue with it. I think the kid probably realizes that it's an alternative to \"dad\" that gets him out of a potentially awkward conversation about what he's to call his new stepdad. I imagine this was done in private, so he had a chance to voice his honest opinion.", "> I\u2019m sorry you\n\nNo good sentence ever started that way. If I mistook your meaning, it was because you phrased it as a blanket statement in a comment that did not reference any specific context or other riders. I can acknowledge that you did mean it in this specific context, and will move on accordingly.\n\n>But, perhaps, the power dynamics fuel that answer. You get what I mean? \n\nI actually do hear what you're saying here, but he was asked by his actual biological father who is clearly bothered by the practice. One would assume that this was asked in private, and it was certainly asked by someone willing to advocate for him. He had a very clear chance to voice any dissent, and he said he was fine with it.\n\n>The son has a rule set in place that he must call his step dad sir. Not step dad, not first name, sir, that is the rule. \n\nI think it's less a rule than it is a mutually agreed practice. The stepdad has other children who only refer to him as \"dad\", so it wouldn't just be potentially uncomfortable for him to have a stepchild who referred to him by his first name, but it would set an uneven standard between his biological and adoptive children. I can certainly see how it sounds a bit awkward, but I get the impression that the word \"sir\" is simply a compromise to avoid the above described situation without pressuring the kid to call him \"dad\" - and I think the kid gets that, based on what was written in this post.\n\nIntegrating separate families is awkward at the best of times, but it sounds to me like the kid and the stepdad have an understanding.", "ooh I see", "I wonder how long ex and step were together before they married.\n\n'Cause like, if you'd asked me at 13, even in private where I could be completely honest, I would have told you my stepfather is a wonderful guy who treats me great and is basically my dad and I love him and he loves me. Absolutely *none* of that was true - he was an abusive alcoholic and drug addict. But I couldn't tell anyone that no matter how many times they asked.\n\nObviously I'm not saying that's the case here, just... I'm more on the cautious side when it comes to kids being a little out of character around their stepparents."]}
