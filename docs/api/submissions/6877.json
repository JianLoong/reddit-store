This got me mad because ever since she was 3 it was my responsibility to care for her. Our parents were too busy with work so whenever she was crying i was expected to handle it. If she needed food or needed attention i had to be there, when it was time for bed I\u2019d be trying to make her sleep everyday for almost an hour or two. \n\nI was only 8 years old but basically had to act as if my little sister was my child, and it sucked because my parents stopped caring for me, they didn\u2019t care how exhausted i was, i just had to do everything for my sister. I would get yelled at if i left her crying for more than 10 minutes. i love my sister but i feel like my childhood got ruined because of  her. Because ever since i was 8 i had to be her parent. It\u2019s like our parents just handed her to me the moment she turned 3. I mean when i grew up i was 18 working mainly for my sister because her food, presents, clothes were all from my paychecks now. Our parents did give her stuff, but it was like 3 gifts every year, to remind her that they loved her. I was working at a Mcdonald\u2019s though, so it hurt when she was sad she didn\u2019t get a expensive gift, but i tried. i still fed her, and i learned how to cook at 12 because my own dad said i would be raising her now, because \u201cwork is too demanding.\u201d\n\nSo, when we had this argument it conspired because my sister made a joke about how i never did anything for her. When i retaliated by saying \u201cyeah right, i did everything for you\u201d she told me to explain how. I explained how i was basically her parent growing up because i had to do everything to keep her safe and take care of her. She then said i was lying because mom told her i never wanted a sister and complained all the time. \n\nI was shocked, so i told her that was a lie and she began getting upset, i have to admit i didn\u2019t handle this well, because younger me would have talked it out, but i began getting upset as-well. We yelled at each other until i said \u201cyou were never grateful of me! Now i do wish i never had a sister!\u201d this hurt her since  she began crying, i felt horrible because i didnt behave like a good big brother, i just didn\u2019t understand how she didn\u2019t know how much i did for her. I just don\u2019t know if i\u2019m in the wrong, because it feels like years of gentle \u201cparenting\u201d as her big bro has gone to waste because she never noticed what i did for her.

Best of luck to you both.", "NAH for you and your sister.\n\nI'm so sorry you had to start parenting at such a young age.  Your parents are the AH, for leaving her in your care and then your mom trying to manipulate your sister against you.  First, many 16yr olds can say mean things to their parents.  And many teenagers and adults don't realize the things our loved ones do for us.  \n\nI bet your sister does know what you've done for her, she may not realize how hard it was, and probably doesn't realize that it was unfair that the work was dumped on you.  It's not fair, but that's the only life she's known.  It's also normal for siblings to lash out at each other, especially at this age. I've said mean things to my brother when we were in that age range.  We're best friends today.\n\nReach out to your sister.  Tell her you love her.  \n\nYour parents are AHs.  If you can, get some counseling or therapy for the trauma and abuse you've been through.  (And yeah, this is abuse, even if it wasn't physical.)", "NTA but if you want some healing on the matter I would encourage you to get into therapy immediately.

You deserve to heal and overcome this part of your story. \n\nOn the upside, your sister didn\u2019t ask for a brother either. \ud83d\ude1c \n\nY\u2019all love each other and you\u2019ll find healthy ways to move forward if that\u2019s what you want.

I believe in you.", "NTA. \n\nBut you should have had this conversation with your parents not her. \n\nYou can just talk to her and explain that you love her greatly, but that you were always the one who cared for her Do not worry, this was probably the most sibling fight I ever heard. You aren\u2019t a bad big brother, you are just a normal big brother, without the responsibility of a 3rd parent now. This is very sibling behaviour, and that is ok. Just talk to her and apologize.", "I am so sorry that you have been put in this situation. It sounds as if your mom has preemptively blamed you by using what you have previously said, and telling your little sister, so that your little sister doesn\u2019t really realise just how bad her mom\u2019s parenting was. (Ditto for her father). \nShe is still a kid and is being conditioned by your parents. So it may be really hard to get her to understand the full situation. Instead maybe just focus on letter her know how you have shown her love over the years. Well done for all that you have done for her.", " NTA\nYou may want to look up something called \u201cparentification trauma complex PTSD\u201d because you may have it.

You were \u201cparentified\u201d, meaning, you had to take on parenting duties of a younger sibling, by your parents.  That\u2019s a shame and I\u2019m sorry that you had to grow up so fast.  But, that is your parents fault.  Not your sister.  It\u2019s not really fair of either of you to say you didn\u2019t want a sister.  I\u2019m sure a sister would have been fine.  You didn\u2019t want to be a parent.  Big difference.  \n\nAs for your sister\u2019s comments about you not doing anything for her\u2026I can see why that is upsetting for you.  Parenting is a thankless job and children by nature are self centered.  A 16 yr old isn\u2019t going to be able to appreciate the way you took care of her yet.  As she gets older and realizes how hard it is to \u201cadult\u201d, her attitude will probably change.  For now, you kind of have to accept that she is a kid and doesn\u2019t get it.  Kids should be allowed to be kids.  Im sorry that you weren\u2019t given that chance, OP.", "ESH.  You should not have said that but I do understand you were pushed to your limit but it was over the line.  Having said that, her ungratefulness is certainly disconcerting.\n\nWhat surprises me is that she has no memory of you doing all of this stuff for her is what I don't get here.  I know that human beings are inherently ungrateful and forget the good deeds done for them, but this is her entire childhood we're talking about here and she has to question what you did for her especially in light of the fact that the parents weren't even present most of the time?", "Boy, this is messy. Mostly NAH if we\u2019re scoping this down to you and your sister. You are danger close to YTA though. \n\nFirst of all, forcing kids into parental roles that early is really bad. 8 year olds aren\u2019t supposed to raise kids, full stop. You\u2019re probably traumatized and resentful in all kinds of ways you don\u2019t even realize yet. In the kindest of ways, you and your sister want to consider therapy when you can, to expedite the healing process. I know that \u201cget therapy\u201d has become a lazy Reddit catch phrase, but \u201cmy parents expected me to raise my baby sister\u201d is well within the wheel house of a good therapist. \n\nSecond, your sister is certainly being unfair to you, but do remember that she\u2019s still a kid. Even in healthy households is super common for teenagers to fight with their parents like this. It\u2019s not an easy phase of life for anyone. And worse still it sounds like your mom is manipulating her, you\u2019ll need to tread carefully. \n\nAs an aside, I\u2019m incredibly uncomfortable with the idea of \u201cungrateful\u201d in kids most of the time. *Kids don\u2019t choose to be born*, and it\u2019s decades before they can fend for themselves. Ideally you\u2019d want kids to be grateful for the work their parents put in, but I think their existence puts more of a duty on others, it\u2019s not a gift. I\u2019ll grant that it\u2019s more complicated in this case, because you didn\u2019t have a hand in her coming into the world.  That being said I don\u2019t think telling anyone that they\u2019re \u201cungrateful\u201d for parenting has ever worked, ever. \n\nThird, please understand that kids in abusive and neglectful situations can have wildly different experiences purely based on where they were in the birth order. It\u2019s nothing inherent to you as people, you just lived wildly different lives based on random chance. Not only did she get to have a childhood when you didn\u2019t, she probably doesn\u2019t remember or understand most of what happened. You\u2019re five years older than her, so you probably remember her birth. You certainly remember being handed her at eight and being told \u201cgood luck\u201d. She won\u2019t remember that, nor might she have any framework for the fact that her upbringing was both unusual and hard on you. It might be years before she understands this. She might never understand it depending on how your relationship with her grows and changes. \n\nAnd finally, I think it\u2019s entirely fair for you to feel somewhat complicated towards her, given that her birth meant your childhood ended. But saying that to her is well on your way to AH status. She didn\u2019t choose this either, and you are the older sibling saying some pretty mean shit to your teenage sister. I think you need to apologize for losing your cool, and *start* the process of explaining what her childhood was like for you. Start. \n\nAlso, therapy. Highly recommend therapy.", "NTA.", "Yta, your sister didn\u2019t ask you to take care of her, your parents made you do it. You\u2019re taking that anger out on your sister when it should be aimed at your parents. Can be really damaging to say something like that to a sibling", "ESH. You ended up confirming her worst fears. Your parents are massive ah for the parentification, and you should have left home much earlier. Your sister needs to learn about your parents, and your efforts is making the shortcomings invisible to her. She is 16, and it is strange that she should be unaware of this, but you do not know what your parents have fed her. \n\nPlease sit her down and let her know what is happening and LEAVE.
