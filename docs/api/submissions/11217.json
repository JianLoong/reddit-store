Between my SIL and my Husband (26M), SIL has always been the golden child of the family. Growing up my in-laws coddled her and gave her everything that she wanted while my husband always got the shitty end of the stick. She was always the popular girl in school, cheerleader, lots of friends, all the boys loved her. While my husband was always a little more nerdy and got picked on quite a bit, even my in-laws would give him a hard time about this and say he needed to be \"more like his sister\".\n\nWhile fast forward to today, both my husband and I went to tops schools, got our degree's and currently have very well paying jobs in tech. I'm not trying to sound braggy, this is just for context, but we live a very, very comfortable life. SIL still currently lives at home with my in-laws where they foot all of her bills, she had my niece (4F) with her ex and is currently on marriage #2. \n\nThis past weekend I was invited to this fancy upscale restaurant in my city for my SIL's bachelorette party (she just wanted to do a nice dinner). There were 8 of us in total. At the end of dinner the bill comes out and the waiter hands it to me...\n\n I'm sitting there confused for a second until SIL speaks up and is all \"my parents and I were talking and were thinking you and my brother can handle the bill for this, as a wedding gift, since you're not financially contributing to my wedding\". I stared at her shocked for a moment and the was like \"and you didn't think to bring this up to me before hand?\". She started going off about how we're so well off so what's the big deal, and she's sure her brother wouldn't have an issue with it. I asked her why her fianc\u00e9 doesn't foot the bill, or my in-laws, and where in her right mind she thinks it's okay to spring this on me?\n\nShe started going on about how we're the wealthiest in both her and her fianc\u00e9's family and that she didn't think I would act like this and would say yes. I told her \"well sorry but I'm not your parents, don't expect hand outs from me\". She called me selfish and I called her and entitled brat, paid for my half of the bill and left.\n\nWell as expected my MIL, SIL, and even some of the cousins and aunts on my husbands side have been absolutely furious with me and are expecting me to apologize for the comments. I told them over my dead body. Husband is 100% on my side, and we are debating on not going to the wedding. I was talking to my mom and she thinks I took it too far with the comments, and should just apologize to keep the peace.

She is an entitled brat who yet again is being enabled by family. You were only invited to be the person to pay, that\u2019s it.  What she did is incredibly disrespectful and disgusting.

You did the right thing.", "Not even close ot being TA. I hate your SIL, and all I heard was this story. She sucks.", "NTA. I wouldn't have paid it either. You don't spring something like that on someone regardless of their finances.", "Huge NTA! She's an entitled brat, to spring it on you and to call you out for not contributing to financing the wedding (why would you!? It's not your wedding, that's what a wedding gift is for) is so far beyond entitlement, it's rude and unreasonable. She's also taking away your choice to give a wedding gift how you choose to. She's a huge AH.", "I would take a luxurious vacation with my husband instead of attending her wedding and post all the amazing pictures during the wedding. Like your instagram stories will look like a college girl discovering a foreign country for the first time. Let her simmer in her nastiness.  Do not apologize even if people want you to \"not rock the boat\". People like your SIL do things like this testing boundaries of how much BS people will take, and the more you take, the more she will give. Stay strong and away from that horrible event. \n\nObviously NTA.", "You spoke the truth and no one liked it.  You and your husband have worked hard to be well off financially, and they don't even want to respect your accomplishments or (*gasp*) **ask** you for a gift of the meal.  Good for you.  Skip that wedding too.  NTA!", "NTA. If it's her bachelorette party, I understand paying for her, like, everyone pays her portion. But the key is everybody. \n\nShe also knew you'd say no, that's why she didn't say anything before hand.", "NTA OP. Don't attend the wedding and don't apologize for peace. F*ck their freaking peace. You and your husband's peace of mind are way more important.", "I spent the first paragraph really confused about who was who's spouse and sibling and whatnot but whatever either way, no NTA, she should've asked beforehand. You don't get to dictate what someone's gift to you will be?", "NTA\n\nYou were not ASKED before hand, you were VOLUNTOLD at the very moment the bill arrived.\n\nI'd have gone with, \"Well it's nice that you decided that WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE, but I didn't bring my credit cards with me.\" and I'd LEAVE.", "NTA\u2026 She totally ambushed you, why would you take kindly to that kind of manipulation!

Return the gift you guys bought if you already did. Make a plan to be out of town for the wedding and cut these entitled weirdos and the rest of the family off. Do not apologize because its way past time someone spoke to your SIL like this. \n\n1k bill plus tip....yeah no f all these people", "NTA\n\nShe invited you to stick you with the bill.\n\nPlease don't attend her wedding.\n\nAnd please cut off contact with your in-laws.\n\nThey're all using you and your husband for money.", "What the actual f&\\*k?! \n\n\"because you're not contributing to my wedding\"\n\nIn what world does a sibling contribute to a wedding?!\n\nShe sounds insanely entitled and anyone backing her is delusional.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA. They were counting on you just paying it to avoid a scene. You speaking up embarrassed them and that\u2019s why they\u2019re making a huge deal of it. \n\nI would honestly consider not even going to the wedding.

She hoped the social pressure would be enough to make you pay.", "NTA.  While sure, it was a bachelorette party and she shouldn't have to pay, her portion of the bill should have been split between the remaining 7 people, NOT the entire thing dumped unknowingly on one person.", "NTA. They purposely put you in an awkward spot and are upset you didn't fold and let them have your way to avoid confrontation like they expected.", "NTA - No, no, and no! The best thing about what you did was to ensure that SIL will never try that *ish with you again. Since you\u2019re the wealthiest family members that she knows, you should now tell her that you and husband are considering not coming to the wedding\u2026which means no gift\u2026and that you\u2019ll be taking all of her actions before the wedding (and the actions of others on her behalf) into consideration when you make your decision.", "NTA. \n\nI *guarantee* you were only invited as a set-up to try and make you pay. \n\nDon't go to the wedding and I'd honestly consider how much contact you want to maintain with SIL and your in-laws moving forward - it's clear they see you two as nothing but an ATM.", "NTA, she is an entitled brat and has no right to tell you and your husband what you should pay for her wedding. I for sure wouldn\u2019t go to the wedding and I would start to distance myself from them. They all will be looking for you and your husband to pay for stuff for them soon. Don\u2019t start down that road, you will become the family bank.", "NTA\n\nI hope you didn't pay half the bill I hope you just paid for your own meal.\n\nYour SIL and her family's behavior was gross and you handled it as kindly as you could.", "NTA. The \"you've got money and a nice life you can do this for me\". No, just plain no. She's a spoilt little princess who needs a wake up call. And you're not contributing to the wedding? Would that be because it's not yours? All the upset relatives can get stuffed as well. Entitlement at its worst. Oh and springing it on you - an indication of what the future holds. She expects access to your money. I'd run.", "NTA - Given past history, I think the meltdown once you refused the role of ATM for her little shindig, I likely would have stood up and, in a clear, carrying voice, announced, \"Hey, everyone, SIL name just told me I'm supposed to pay for everyone at this table because I'm rich and she's a broke-ass moocher!\"  Then dropped money for my share on the table (with a good tip) and walked out.\n\nIt really sounds as if you and your husband need to shut down much of any interchange with his family going forward.  Certainly would not recommend attending the wedding because the lack of a very expensive gift will likely be the subject of her next tantrum in the middle of the reception.", "NTA. Don't go to the wedding. The expectation that you contribute to her wedding in anyway is fucking absurd. Furthermore, the wedding party pays for the bachelorette party .", "Why would you want to keep the peace with any of these people? I'd skip the wedding because that's not a relationship I'd care about because once the hand in your pocket starts, it doesn't end. NTA.", "NTA. Anyone who says you are can pay the restaurant bill!", "You were invited to this dinner, correct?  You didn\u2019t throw this party and host it?  On what planet does a guest get handed a 1k bill for a party they were invited to???  \n\nThe entitlement is strong with her and your husband\u2019s extended family.  It\u2019s time to go NC for a while and definitely do NOT go to that wedding.  There\u2019s no way that would turn out well for you given how this family has behaved.  Send a generic wedding card wishing them well and nothing else.  It will make the point for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nDon't apologize. No matter how much money you make, you are not expected to:\n\n1) Contribute to your SIL's wedding (wtf)  \n2) Foot the bill for an entire bachelorette party that you were attending as a guest  \n3) De-escalate her temper tantrum once she didn't get her way\n\nThe burden of payment for a bachelorette party usually falls on the Maid of Honor and Bridesmaids (and arranged for ahead of time!!!) or the Bride.", "NTA. You have zero obligation to pay a dime to that moocher.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t tell you ahead of time because she knew you would (rightly) say no. She thought you would cave if you were put on the spot, so GOOD FOR YOU for not giving in.", "NTA. Since you\u2019re not financially contributing to the wedding???  Well, why the hell would you?  It\u2019s not your wedding. It\u2019s not your child\u2019s wedding.\n\nI hope you go NC with all of them.", "NTA- Why should you pay the dinner bill? They are way too entitled.", "NTA. Show up to the wedding and move on. They know where you and your husband stand. Let them make the next move.", "NTA", "Jesus. NTA don\u2019t go to the wedding and maybe forget that side of the family.", "Am I reading this right that you paid for half of this $1000 party?  She thought you should pay for the entire party as a wedding gift and you paid for half so there's her wedding gift.  \n\nAnd it should be the last gift she ever gets from you and her brother.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - You have zero obligation", "Why on earth should she foot the bill and be \u2018graceful\u2019 to someone behaving so classlessly? I doubt she will be getting a gift or contributing in any way now anyway. 1k to be \u2018graceful\u2019 is a lot", "Excuse me? ! People do not get to spend other people's money ever.

Bs \n\n\n\nOp nta and don't go to the wedding. Personally no gift and no contact if your husband is good with it. That family is disgusting.", "No, paying a bill like that turns you into a doormat who has opened the door for more instances of being used for money. \n\nOP set a boundary. This was the healthiest thing to do. Her SIL needed to have her ridiculous and greedy expectations called out and stepped on before they turned into something more.\n\nNever let people use you.", "Insane to think that anyone could possibly be an asshole for not paying a large, frivolous bill they weren't told about ahead of time,.  Unrelated question, wanna go out for dinner with me this weekend?", "Not to mention it's a second wedding.  Second weddings typically aren't the big frilly to-do that first weddings are, because second weddings mean \"been there, done that, returned the t-shirt\".  A lot of second weddings are funded by the couple BECAUSE they're smaller weddings. \n\nThis expectation of a handout just blows my mind.", "I was more clear on who was what relation to OP in this post than a lot of the ones I've read here. There's OP, OP's husband, and OP's husband's sister. I agree, NTA.", "A younger sibling, at that!", "Hahaha that\u2019s my favourite bit of the movie", "A second wedding, at that!", "I missed 2nd wedding. WOW!"]}
