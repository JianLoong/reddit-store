Between my SIL and my Husband (26M), SIL has always been the golden child of the family. Growing up my in-laws coddled her and gave her everything that she wanted while my husband always got the shitty end of the stick. She was always the popular girl in school, cheerleader, lots of friends, all the boys loved her.

I'm not trying to sound braggy, this is just for context, but we live a very, very comfortable life.

There were 8 of us in total.

I stared at her shocked for a moment and the was like \"and you didn't think to bring this up to me before hand?\". She started going off about how we're so well off so what's the big deal, and she's sure her brother wouldn't have an issue with it. I asked her why her fianc\u00e9 doesn't foot the bill, or my in-laws, and where in her right mind she thinks it's okay to spring this on me?\n\nShe started going on about how we're the wealthiest in both her and her fianc\u00e9's family and that she didn't think I would act like this and would say yes. I told her \"well sorry but I'm not your parents, don't expect hand outs from me\". She called me selfish and I called her and entitled brat, paid for my half of the bill and left.\n\nWell as expected my MIL, SIL, and even some of the cousins and aunts on my husbands side have been absolutely furious with me and are expecting me to apologize for the comments. I told them over my dead body. Husband is 100% on my side, and we are debating on not going to the wedding.

The \"you've got money and a nice life you can do this for me\". No, just plain no. She's a spoilt little princess who needs a wake up call. And you're not contributing to the wedding? Would that be because it's not yours? All the upset relatives can get stuffed as well. Entitlement at its worst. Oh and springing it on you - an indication of what the future holds. She expects access to your money. I'd run.", "NTA - Given past history, I think the meltdown once you refused the role of ATM for her little shindig, I likely would have stood up and, in a clear, carrying voice, announced, \"Hey, everyone, SIL name just told me I'm supposed to pay for everyone at this table because I'm rich and she's a broke-ass moocher!\"  Then dropped money for my share on the table (with a good tip) and walked out.\n\nIt really sounds as if you and your husband need to shut down much of any interchange with his family going forward.  Certainly would not recommend attending the wedding because the lack of a very expensive gift will likely be the subject of her next tantrum in the middle of the reception.", "NTA. Don't go to the wedding. The expectation that you contribute to her wedding in anyway is fucking absurd. Furthermore, the wedding party pays for the bachelorette party .", "Why would you want to keep the peace with any of these people?

On what planet does a guest get handed a 1k bill for a party they were invited to???  \n\nThe entitlement is strong with her and your husband\u2019s extended family.  It\u2019s time to go NC for a while and definitely do NOT go to that wedding.  There\u2019s no way that would turn out well for you given how this family has behaved.

Contribute to your SIL's wedding (wtf)\n2. Foot the bill for an entire bachelorette party that you were attending as a guest\n3. De-escalate her temper tantrum once she didn't get her way\n\nThe burden of payment for a bachelorette party usually falls on the Maid of Honor and Bridesmaids (and arranged for ahead of time!!!) or the Bride.\n\nEDIT: And a far more common occurrence is that everyone pays their own way but chips in for the bride so that she is taken care of, but again, that's settled way ahead of time!", "NTA. You have zero obligation to pay a dime to that moocher.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t tell you ahead of time because she knew you would (rightly) say no.
