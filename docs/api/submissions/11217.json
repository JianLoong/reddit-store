Between my SIL and my Husband (26M), SIL has always been the golden child of the family. Growing up my in-laws coddled her and gave her everything that she wanted while my husband always got the shitty end of the stick. She was always the popular girl in school, cheerleader, lots of friends, all the boys loved her.

I'm not trying to sound braggy, this is just for context, but we live a very, very comfortable life.

She started going off about how we're so well off so what's the big deal, and she's sure her brother wouldn't have an issue with it. I asked her why her fianc\u00e9 doesn't foot the bill, or my in-laws, and where in her right mind she thinks it's okay to spring this on me?\n\nShe started going on about how we're the wealthiest in both her and her fianc\u00e9's family and that she didn't think I would act like this and would say yes.

She's an entitled brat, to spring it on you and to call you out for not contributing to financing the wedding (why would you!?

Like your instagram stories will look like a college girl discovering a foreign country for the first time. Let her simmer in her nastiness.

The \"you've got money and a nice life you can do this for me\". No, just plain no. She's a spoilt little princess who needs a wake up call. And you're not contributing to the wedding? Would that be because it's not yours? All the upset relatives can get stuffed as well. Entitlement at its worst. Oh and springing it on you - an indication of what the future holds. She expects access to your money. I'd run.", "NTA - Given past history, I think the meltdown once you refused the role of ATM for her little shindig, I likely would have stood up and, in a clear, carrying voice, announced, \"Hey, everyone, SIL name just told me I'm supposed to pay for everyone at this table because I'm rich and she's a broke-ass moocher!\"  Then dropped money for my share on the table (with a good tip) and walked out.\n\nIt really sounds as if you and your husband need to shut down much of any interchange with his family going forward.  Certainly would not recommend attending the wedding because the lack of a very expensive gift will likely be the subject of her next tantrum in the middle of the reception.", "NTA. Don't go to the wedding. The expectation that you contribute to her wedding in anyway is fucking absurd. Furthermore, the wedding party pays for the bachelorette party .", "Why would you want to keep the peace with any of these people?

On what planet does a guest get handed a 1k bill for a party they were invited to???  \n\nThe entitlement is strong with her and your husband\u2019s extended family.  It\u2019s time to go NC for a while and definitely do NOT go to that wedding.  There\u2019s no way that would turn out well for you given how this family has behaved.

Contribute to your SIL's wedding (wtf)\n2. Foot the bill for an entire bachelorette party that you were attending as a guest\n3. De-escalate her temper tantrum once she didn't get her way\n\nThe burden of payment for a bachelorette party usually falls on the Maid of Honor and Bridesmaids (and arranged for ahead of time!!!) or the Bride.\n\nEDIT: And a far more common occurrence is that everyone pays their own way but chips in for the bride so that she is taken care of, but again, that's settled way ahead of time!", "NTA. You have zero obligation to pay a dime to that moocher.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t tell you ahead of time because she knew you would (rightly) say no.

Oh hells no. If she was expecting you to pay she should have discussed it with you first. She doesn\u2019t get to say how you spend your money just because you make more than her.

Well done!  \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nToo many people let the entitled AHs get away with awful behaviors in the name of keeping peace.  We should all aspire to be more like OP.", "[removed]", "\"And there's no world in which it's okay to pick an expensive location, invite someone as a guest, order (almost certainly) more than you would if you were footing the bill yourself, then expect one guest to pay the whole bill on the spot.\"\n\nWell, if there is such a place, then someone needs to tell me about it quickly because I have reservations to make and invitations to send!", "Same on every stag I've ever been on. We all pay our way, plus our portion of the groom's expenses.\n\nOP is definitely not the asshole.", "Seriously!", "In my discombobulation while writing my initial comment, I completely forgot that paying your own way was an option, lol. \n\nAt the three bachelorette parties I've attended, everyone paid their own way but we all chipped in for the bride.", "[removed]", "I hosted a bachelor party dinner at a restaurant in downtown Disney (we spent the day in Disneyland but went to the dinner in a place where anyone could join even if they couldn't go to Disneyland). When the check came we basically passed it around, and anyone could put in any amount they wanted to and nobody would know. They could pay for their own food and drink, or their own plus some of the groom's, or none, or just what they could afford.  I paid the rest and did not let the groom see or touch the bill. We did have drinks and shared appetizers and desserts, but it wasn't a fancy restaurant. \n\nThe total I paid was at least $1200, and that was with a lot of people pitching in and it not being a fancy restaurant.", "I have never heard of one doing that, but if you offered that is completely different!", "I contributed to my bro's wedding by catering the food for them.  My siblings & parents pitched in money as well.  I offered to make the food to save them money (single parents of 4 kids with deadbeat exes) & they gave me a budget of $250 for 75 people.  That wasn't happening.  So we all pitched in to make sure they had a fantastic reception.  But that's a far cry from someone just expecting family to pay for their wedding.", "that\u2019s what happens when you raise a child to think the world must bend to their every whim. you have to teach a kid to be kind, but also that as amazing and important and special they are to you, they aren\u2019t that to everyone else. that everyone has people that they value and people they don\u2019t; and if you want people to value you, you have to build relationships with them. if SIL had been raised right instead of being raised to believe she was perfect and amazing and deserved the world for \u201cjust being her\u201d, she wouldn\u2019t be this way. they didn\u2019t bet on the wrong child, they failed at parenting her. she is an adult now and needs to do the work to change, but its no one\u2019s fault but her parent\u2019s that they are stuck with an entitled brat who thinks her long lost pretty privilege absolves her of any responsibility.", "Hahahaha. Touche. But you gotta figure that by then OP will be fully no contact with SIL because of her... dynamic personality.", "Then why comment?", "I don't disagree with you at all. I would been pissed if I was her", "Right! I was reading this and i thought: i would have paid. Op handled it perfect!!!", "Comment stolen from u/proud_didi", "They can always catch the third wedding!\n\nGolden child status didn't quite work out for her, huh?", "I took the kid's soccer buddies to In n Out the other day and it was like $1,000 /s/ \n\nBut point being $1,000 aint nothing these days for a party of 8", "Yep - I contributed to my SIL's wedding by making all the cakes. It was a home-made wedding, and all family chipped in with food, pot-luck style. Ditto for my best friend. But all that was arranged and de-conflicted with other \"in-kind\" contributors. Expecting a $$$ contribution, let alone forcing one? That is next level entitlement and a-holery.
