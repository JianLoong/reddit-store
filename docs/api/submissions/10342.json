I think this is a follow your heart situation, you are the one that it will impact most. I think it\u2019s admirable to be thinking critically about these sort of complex matters. But colleges are tough right now, and as long as you are just checking a box reflective of your true ethnicity, I don\u2019t personally find fault in that. I would feel differently if you wrote an essay playing it up like a huge part of your identity if it\u2019s not. The reason why even small percentages of Native American ancestry \u201ccount\u201d is because of the immense amount of struggle and genocide caused by white colonizers. Even if it\u2019s a small percentage of you, if a college recognizes that a reason to give you money/acceptance I wouldn\u2019t feel bad about it. \n\nI just can\u2019t find anyone hugely at fault here.

One can argue about how effective they are at this goal but in the very microsense they will help some individuals get in who would otherwise have not gotten in due to such discrimination.  If you feel that you have not faced such discrimination it would be unethical to leverage some advantage away from someone who has faced such discrimination as it somewhat of a zero sum game. It may however have no such effect on your admission chances.  \nJust put what you feel is true to yourself.  The only way to be the asshole here is to put an answer specifically to game the system.", "Ots up to you, but the things the western world did to our indigenous people still hurt people today. If you feel your mother was any less able to support you because of this intergenerational trauma, I believe you are fully entitled to compensation.", "NTA but I want to challenge whether or not the choice was ethical.  \n\n\nWhile you may not have a direct connection to that family, the reason these actions are taken into place are because of more systemic issues. Native American people had to go through more struggle and hardship than white people in the United States. This happened for generations, and while each generation may have advanced out of those hardships, the end result is that, on the whole, Native Americans (and many other minority groups) have not gotten as far as other groups that were not as discriminated against.   \n\n\nI.e. if all of your family was white, on average, they would have more opportunities, because their parents had more opportunities, and their grandparents had more opportunities, etc. I don't know what you or your family's situation is, but I think either choice is ethical. It's not necessarily about whether or not you are close to your Native American roots, but how much it as impacted your potential through the generations of people before you.", "NTA. Though it's weird to not maximize your chances of getting into the schools of your choice. And what a thing to write about for an essay, your doubts and conflict would be gold! There's nothing wrong with taking advantage (I use that loosely here) if your heritage here. Think of it as a way to contribute to your culture and enable others to have a path forward.", "NTA. How can you be ashamed of something you aren't?  According to you,  you don't involve yourselves in the culture, practice its traditions or languages etc. It's like doing a dna test and finding out you're 1/8 Guatemalan.", "You're not exactly an ah for doing it the way you did, but you are being a bit foolish in not using every advantage you have.

You better believe I check the Hispanic box whenever I have the chance.", "NTA because if your parents haven't really made much effort to connect you with the culture and you haven't seen them since you were 7, they can hardly blame you for not feeling that connection. The piece of paper isn't going to mean much if it isn't actually the culture you were brought up in. If you did apply as native and got asked questions you couldn't answer, it would be really uncomfortable. I think you did the right thing.", "NAH, but consider that the programs and policies intended to benefit Native students aren't at all intended for only the Native students that are in tune with their culture and heritage. You have a Native bloodline, and that entitles you to certain privileges as far as reparations go. Personally I'd recommend that you utilize those privileges as often as you can.", "NTA \n\nYou should just go with your feelings and how you feel like you identify according to the purpose of having ethnicity in the college application. I would personally consider whether or not I am taking opportunity from those who need it or not and whether or not you need it. That's all up to you.\n\nThis reminds me of a scene from Switched at Birth. Idk if you pass as white but there was a character Daphne who was white, but grew up in a Latina family bc the hospital gave the family the wrong baby\n\nWhen it was time to apply to college, they had this debate. Daphne wanted to go for a Latina scholarship bc she grew up Latina essentially and the characters debated whether or not she should. Of course, Daphne was Latina having grown up Latina just not ethnically Latina. \n\nSo Daphne qualified for the scholarship, but she felt bad when she meant other applicants who were all ethnically Latina and spoke on their experiences and struggles from being ethnically Latina specifically - so she felt bad bc she didn't experience anything like that and I think I remember she felt like she didn't need the scholarship the same way \n\nPersonally I would just examine what you feel you need and how you identify bc you're valid either way. If you do pass as white it doesn't make you not native American. It's all up to you", "NTA.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm white. But I grew up in a region with a lot of First Nations and Inuit people, and have heard thoughts on this sort of situation from First Nations classmates & coworkers, including people who were still directly involved with their tribe & traditional culture, and those who weren't.\n\nYour reasoning for not citing the Native vein of your family history feels very fair. You say you're 1/8 Native and not connected with the culture; in your shoes, I'd feel uneasy about listing myself as Native under those circumstances too. I know people who are half First Nations who don't check the box because of cultural disconnect. It's down to each individual person to do what feels comfortable and honest to themselves. Which you did. You don't have an emotional or experience-based connection to this side of your heritage, so it feels disingenuous to selectively identify like this. That makes sense to me.\n\nPeople in the comments are saying you should take advantage of any boost you can, and that universities want 'diversity applications'--and that's true. But I don't know... a lot of colleges/universities and workplaces tend to hit their quota of 'diversity applicants' and then start rejecting people pell mell (unfortunately something I've seen irl), and in your position, I'd be worried that if I checked the box it might contribute to the shouldering-out of someone who's more immediately connected with their tribe and culture and had to grow up dealing directly with the racism & systemic oppression that in all likelihood you haven't had to contend with yourself.", "i was literally you a little over 20 years ago, one of the biggest mistakes of my life.  so much of the admissions and financing side of college is a giant shit heap, you're applying ethics to a situation that doesn't call for it.", " NAH\u2014 I\u2019m 1/8 African and I note my heritage as white because I benefit from white privilege and don\u2019t feel connected to the culture of the country that part of my family is from (they are not descendants of enslaved people but immigrants from Africa), so I definitely sympathize, but I also get why your mom feels how she does about it. Honestly I don\u2019t think you would be wrong however you decided. It could however help your family out if you could apply for special scholarships that you are entitled to.", "That was dumb.

There are lots of advantages to applying to college as a native american including help with tuition. Whether or not you feel part of the native culture doesn't really matter, because truthfully, you ARE actually native. You don't have to live on a reservation or even be part of the community tbh. You're depriving yourself of a lot of advantages which just seems silly. Good luck and maybe when you're older you may want to explore that part of your heritage a bit more.", "You guys have to put your ethnicity when applying to colleges in America? Why?", "NTA.\nJust for my information, are they allowed to ask about your lineage? Really? That feels so very wrong to me (don\u2019t want to use big words, but I have a lot of bad associations with it). Are you expected to keep track of your complete family lineage? For how long? Schools in my country once tried asking parents education level (good intentions, extra money for children that may need extra help) and it was NOT appreciated. I can\u2019t imagine asking about ethnicity.", "Assuming you are 7/8 white, it would be more fitting to apply as white.\n\nAmericans really have a habit of identifying with their 0.006% \"interesting\" heritage, whether it be native or Irish or Italian, it looks rather silly.\n\nThe silliest thing of all of course is having to put race on college applications", "It would be interesting to see if college apps have a definition of race. The US Census definition of Native American does in fact include being \"one who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment\".  The definition of white is so broad it includes many individuals who are perceived in society as non-white based on skin color.", "Hijacking your comment because I agree with you.\n\nI understand this on a different level....\n\nI'm part aboriginal (Australia), my Dad is half, his Mum was full. I used to get bullied for it. So in high school I didn't really tell anyone outside of my friends who knew. I remember a couple of friends from other schools found out and gave me shit for it but I just ignored it and laughed along. \n\nThen I thought who gives a fuck and fuck everyone who says negative things about it. Then I got a bit older and was like double fuck it, I'm taking advantage of my heritage. Lots of places have a quota of indigenous spots regarding work etc and they need to tick that diversity box and some even get paid by the government to employ us. I thought why not take advantage of that?! So I started putting it on my resume. If I can have an advantage not everyone has or something that sets me apart from the group, why not use it? We even get cheaper home loans and free/cheap medical schemes because they're trying to bridge the gap between us and white people. \n\nSo I totally understand your dilemma, but seriously, take any leg up you can get! I'm not extremely close to my indigenous side, culture wise and my Grandmother was an elder of where I live, so I get that you feel bad but most people who could use it to help them would, so why not do it? You're not loosing anything by claiming your heritage and you can't change it. Be proud of who you are regardless of what % of native blood you have in you.", "Completely agree.  Whether the rules are right or wrong is not relevant, what is important is getting into a college and claiming a rightful heritage does impact decisions especially if you claim to be a native because they do need to ensure proper representation within the school rolls. Take every advantage you can get.", "Not just America, Australia and New Zealand as well", "In New Zealand the census has two questions: one asking whether you're M\u0101ori and one asking whether you have M\u0101ori ancestry. The first one's not *quite* the same as requiring active community attachment, because you can totally be M\u0101ori while being disconnected from the culture, but it's on the same scale in that it doesn't rely solely on blood quantum and ignore identity.", "Considering that they too suffered the consequences, yes, they are", "YTA.

They\u2019re your people even if they\u2019re distant. Also, your parents are right, because there are often scholarship opportunities and admissions quotas for Native students.

You're allowed to have a complicated relationship with your heritage and not be willing to be open about it. \n\nI'm with your parents here, but why you did what you did is pretty clear.", "NTA", "NTA but you should consider applying to others as native/indigenous\n\nCollege is transformative and crazy expensive in the US, so whatever get you can get *for the truth* of your lineage is absolutely fair.\n\nI would even talk about that in your essays - college could be where you find your voice as someone who isn't connected to that side \n\nIt's normal for ppl of mixed heritage to not connect to it until older, bc when younger you are so focused on just fitting in and NOT being different in any way.", "Look, you have documentation. Wether you feel connected or not, you are eligible for everything offered as a native american. It is hard enough to get ahead in this world. Take advantage of this opportunity to get ahead.

Cash it in", "NAH, but it sounds like you should explain your motivation a little bit better to your parents. You applied as white to avoid taking \"undue\" (in your view) advantage of your lineage. But they may be interpreting it as that you see being Native as somehow bad. You should make it clear to them that you don't have a problem with *being* Native, only with taking advantage of being Native for college applications.", "NTA.\n\nYou are clearly a very good person at heart and it really makes me happy to see that.\n\nBut as other people are saying, grab every legitimate advantage you can get.", "NAH", "NTA but you have hurt your chances at being accepted and getting financial assistance", "NAH, but I want to point out that ethics mean nothing in this situation. Universities are not ethical themselves. Why not claim your ancestry and take the opportunity to reconnect and learn more? Literally every Native person I\u2019ve ever met enthusiastically supports reconnection\u2014it\u2019s one of the ways to keep a culture alive and it has nothing to do with reservations\u2014there are city Natives too. I have a close friend who is enrolled but didn\u2019t grow up in the culture and was actively worried about the fact that his enrollment might have been a lie\u2014now he works with his tribal elders and in his community, has taken research trips back to where his grandmother originally had a plot of land and learned more about himself, his family, and the struggles that Indigenous people face today.", "NTA - it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole but your parents are correct.", "NAH I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re the asshole, but maybe a bit naive. It\u2019s not unethical to give yourself every chance at success, especially considering the debt you\u2019ll accumulate and the potential recession that could affect the job market when you graduate. \n\nIt\u2019s a dog eat dog world out here, kid. Don\u2019t shoot yourself in the foot because you don\u2019t want to take advantage of this opportunity. \n\nYou are just dollar bills in the eyes of these schools at the end of the day. I think it\u2019s admirable that you don\u2019t want to claim something if you don\u2019t feel connected, but you are Native American in the eyes of the law and in this context, there\u2019s no ethical gray area here.", "NAH.  But as another poster put it, there is nothing wrong with taking advantage of any and all advantages you may have.\n\nHowever, while I understand your hesitation due to what fraction Native you are coupled with your experience with the reservation, I offer that you consider it for no other reason than this country (USA) owes a huge debt to Natives.  As such, the least you can do for your ancestors is to exploit any advantage for their sake.  I am not trying to admonish your decision, just offering a different perspective to consider that runs a little deeper than the logical rationale you have.\n\nRegardless of your final decision, best of luck to you.  And you did not come off as ashamed of your heritage.", "You 100% have a better chance getting in as a minority.

It's nobody else's business.", "OP, I'm not sure how much history you've gone into on why someone with some native American Ancestry may be removed from the culture but let me be clear. \n\nYou can totally choose to use it on applications or not. That is your right. But the only person youre hurting is yourself by not using it. You aren't lying by claiming it. You aren't knocking someone else out who \"deserves to be there more\" your telling the school all the factors of your application. \n\nIf they want to judge you more worthy because your recent history is tied to this country's abuse that is their choice.", "Have you checked with any native American subreddits? I've seen a lot of them say that even being partially native makes you native, due to the unique genocide of native Americans. You should check to see if your guilt is unfounded", "NAH. I think it's not only important to acknowledge your heritage, but also take advantage of what's available to you. Your mother and her family endured a lot, and you should let the govt make it up to you. As ypu improve ypur situation, you're undoing the generational trauma inflicted on your family. I say this as a person who's also 1/4 native, but didn't grow up immersed in the culture because of my grandparents' trauma and shame. Take advantage of what you can, then think of ways to use your privilege to help your tribe. Good luck with everything, I know how complicated it all is.", "I think you should reconsider. If I\u2019m not mistaken you can get scholarships and even get into more schools.", "It's not about bragging about being diverse. Wow. Just wow.\n\nThey have actual goals if not set standards.", "I totally get where OP is coming from.  My dad's side is mixed Latino and Native, and when I was applying to colleges I ticked \"White\" or declined to disclose, because I didn't feel connected to that side of the family or that heritage at all.  I don't speak Spanish, I've never been to a reservation, and I mostly grew up with my mom's very WASPy family.  It felt dishonest to me, and I wanted to succeed on my own merits, not due to what I perceived as an advantage I wasn't entitled to.\n\nLooking back now as an adult, however, I can see the impact that race has had on my family for generations.  My grandmother could tell stories about her and her husband being itinerant fruit-pickers, but folks barring them from towns because they were \"taking jobs\" from white laborers.  Schools assumed my dad couldn't read because of his race.  When they moved to Chicago, redlining was still a very real thing.\n\nWas I alive for any of that?  No.  But as an adult I can look back and say, \"Oh, grandma wasn't allowed to live here, so that pushed my dad into a worse school system\" and so on and so on.", "I have never heard of anywhere having a quota for disabled people, do you have any further info on that?", "It\u2019s because they desire culture of their own, but we don\u2019t got any.", "What happened to Natives is multi generational. When you erase entire families, cultures, histories, and so many atrocities that go undocumented. You create a pain that can take centuries to heal.\nThere are people who are born into wealth because of what they stole from Natives.\nEven today, there are tribes that can\u2019t even get clean running water because the government doesn\u2019t support building infrastructure to their land.\n\nCheck your privilege.", "I don't think people are as un-\"involved\" as you think.  In the same way that descendants of massive wealth have different privileges that they had no hand in creating, descendants of massive trauma have disadvantages that are passed on to them, and that they had no hand in creating.", "My grandfather attended a residential school in the US and the abuse he endured got passed down to my father, and then to me. So yeah, we're still involved.", "That\u2019s because explicit racial quotas were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court decades ago. This is a bad comment.", "Why? Isn't that a bit rude to ask?"]}
