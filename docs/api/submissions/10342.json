You refuse to... tell the truth", "NAH\n\nYeah, checking \u201cNative\u201d on your applications would probably give you a little edge when trying to get into schools\u2026 because those schools like being able to brag about their diversity.  It\u2019s all a big messy situation.  \n\nWhat you put on your application is up to you.  If you feel wrong using 1/8th heritage on applications just to have a better chance of getting in, then don\u2019t do it.  On the other hand, if you want to go ahead and check \u201cNative/Indigenous\u201d on the applications, you aren\u2019t lying.  There\u2019s no correct amount of attachment you have to have to your ancestry to be able to claim it, especially for something like a school application.", "Either way, you're telling the truth. It just comes down to your feelings. Your parents want to maximize your odds of getting accepted, but who can say what admissions offices are looking for.\n\nNAH", "NTA - but - you may be reducing your chances of getting into your top choices by NOT claiming your tribal membership on your application and in your essay.\n\nColleges want that diversity and so does the federal government which is why you qualify for numerous scholarships and small business loans because of your documented tribal lineage.\n\nThat would be like a Princeton alum NOT stating their a legacy applicant. You can do it but you're just hurting your own chances by not leveraging this additional advantage.", "NTA\n\nIf you feel it is ethically wrong to apply as Native because you are not connected to the heritage and do not identify with it, then don't do it. \n\nYour parents want you to have the best chance of admittance, but in the end you are the person who has to be able to live with yourself.   \n\n If you feel like you do have a connection with your tribe then you should go for it without guilt.", "NTA. But just one white dudes perspective... sometimes the injustice that has been served to a community takes many generations to heal. Sure, you may not be actively participating in the tribe activities, but that doesn't mean that your not owed something for the injustice served to your community. It also doesn't mean that you wont change your mind as you get older and want to be more in touch with your heritage. Ultimately it's up to you which box you check, but don't feel bad for getting what is given freely to you.", "NTA: There's being Indigenous and then there's having Indigenous ancestry. It seems like at this point you are being quite truthful to yourself. Even though you can claim it you don't want to because you recognize how far removed you are physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually from your people. Perhaps one day you'll connect more with them and their original ways and you will establish yourself as Indigenous but at this moment it definitely sounds like you are a person that simply has Indigenous ancestry. Better to leave the opportunities for the Indigenous people that have that connection and experiences. No need to take opportunities away from them.", "NTA.\nYou are 7/8 not Native American. You are what you feel you are", "Info: are you white-passing? Is your name white sounding? \n\nIf you look biracial or have an indigenous name, you're probably facing bias whether you realize it or not.  checking the box for indigenous heritage would be appropriate to ensure you're considered, especially at colleges that are just checking diversity boxes but prefer white students. \n\nIt's admirable that you want to be ethical here, but even if you haven't seen that part of your family in many years, and lack a cultural connection, your ethnicity could be relevant.", "I might leave this up for natives to answer, but you're actually more likely to get into college if you're white. As for the rest, I have a cousin who is similar (except her 1/8 is Latina), and I would be surprised if she applied anywhere as Latina, tbh. I think there's a complexity here, also, about whether or not you benefit from white privilege.", "I don't think you're an asshole but some schools, like the public university system in Maine, offer native American's free tuition and others offer a tuition credit. From a financial standpoint, you may qualify for a program that will reduce the overall cost of your education.", "NTA And that is a interesting and frankly beautiful way of looking at the world. What I can add though is that \n1. Not speaking to a certain side of the family doesn t mean you are not part of it.\n2. Especially when you live in the USA, almost no one is \"American\". You just have to go a few generations back and everyone is from somewhere else. IMO you are as much Native as you are \"American\", it should only be your choice of what you feel right that matters", "You are silly for not using your native American heritage to your advantage. Most colleges and places of work, now have a quota of non white heritages to fill and / or a quota of non abled bodied people.", "Thai doesn\u2019t sound like an asshole non asshole problem. I do think you did the right thing", "definitely NTA\n\nIt's up to you how you want to represent yourself to the world.\n\n\nIMO though, it's a dog-eat-dog world out there and you should take advantage of the 'system' to help yourself, whether that is college admissions, govt. handouts, job opportunities etc.", "NAH - however, this special consideration for First Nations (and Native Hawaiians in my case), exists because of the fact that our lineage was almost completely eradicated due to the actions of the US Government at the time. \nIt exists as a way to propel our rare bloodline into opportunities that could potentially afford better education, and potential for change in our chosen career.\n\nYou may not feel culturally Native, but your existence and quantum - one drop even - are rare in this world. \n\nPlease consider this a potential for change.

I think this is a follow your heart situation, you are the one that it will impact most. I think it\u2019s admirable to be thinking critically about these sort of complex matters. But colleges are tough right now, and as long as you are just checking a box reflective of your true ethnicity, I don\u2019t personally find fault in that. I would feel differently if you wrote an essay playing it up like a huge part of your identity if it\u2019s not. The reason why even small percentages of Native American ancestry \u201ccount\u201d is because of the immense amount of struggle and genocide caused by white colonizers. Even if it\u2019s a small percentage of you, if a college recognizes that a reason to give you money/acceptance I wouldn\u2019t feel bad about it. \n\nI just can\u2019t find anyone hugely at fault here. Your mom might also be having some complicated feelings like you rejected her heritage\u2026..and wanted you to have the best opportunities. You are grappling with tough issues about your identity only you can really answer. Best of luck.", "NAH.\n\nAny increase in your acceptance changes due to race would be down to programs are designed to combat those who have faced structural discrimination due to their ethnicity.  One can argue about how effective they are at this goal but in the very microsense they will help some individuals get in who would otherwise have not gotten in due to such discrimination.  If you feel that you have not faced such discrimination it would be unethical to leverage some advantage away from someone who has faced such discrimination as it somewhat of a zero sum game. It may however have no such effect on your admission chances.  \nJust put what you feel is true to yourself.  The only way to be the asshole here is to put an answer specifically to game the system.", "Ots up to you, but the things the western world did to our indigenous people still hurt people today. If you feel your mother was any less able to support you because of this intergenerational trauma, I believe you are fully entitled to compensation.", "NTA but I want to challenge whether or not the choice was ethical.  \n\n\nWhile you may not have a direct connection to that family, the reason these actions are taken into place are because of more systemic issues. Native American people had to go through more struggle and hardship than white people in the United States. This happened for generations, and while each generation may have advanced out of those hardships, the end result is that, on the whole, Native Americans (and many other minority groups) have not gotten as far as other groups that were not as discriminated against.   \n\n\nI.e. if all of your family was white, on average, they would have more opportunities, because their parents had more opportunities, and their grandparents had more opportunities, etc. I don't know what you or your family's situation is, but I think either choice is ethical. It's not necessarily about whether or not you are close to your Native American roots, but how much it as impacted your potential through the generations of people before you.", "NTA. Though it's weird to not maximize your chances of getting into the schools of your choice. And what a thing to write about for an essay, your doubts and conflict would be gold! There's nothing wrong with taking advantage (I use that loosely here) if your heritage here. Think of it as a way to contribute to your culture and enable others to have a path forward.", "NTA. How can you be ashamed of something you aren't?  According to you,  you don't involve yourselves in the culture, practice its traditions or languages etc. It's like doing a dna test and finding out you're 1/8 Guatemalan.", "You're not exactly an ah for doing it the way you did, but you are being a bit foolish in not using every advantage you have. I'm Latino, but was adopted by white people so my name is European and I do not speak Spanish. You better believe I check the Hispanic box whenever I have the chance.", "NTA because if your parents haven't really made much effort to connect you with the culture and you haven't seen them since you were 7, they can hardly blame you for not feeling that connection. The piece of paper isn't going to mean much if it isn't actually the culture you were brought up in. If you did apply as native and got asked questions you couldn't answer, it would be really uncomfortable. I think you did the right thing.", "NAH, but consider that the programs and policies intended to benefit Native students aren't at all intended for only the Native students that are in tune with their culture and heritage. You have a Native bloodline, and that entitles you to certain privileges as far as reparations go. Personally I'd recommend that you utilize those privileges as often as you can.", "NTA \n\nYou should just go with your feelings and how you feel like you identify according to the purpose of having ethnicity in the college application. I would personally consider whether or not I am taking opportunity from those who need it or not and whether or not you need it. That's all up to you.\n\nThis reminds me of a scene from Switched at Birth. Idk if you pass as white but there was a character Daphne who was white, but grew up in a Latina family bc the hospital gave the family the wrong baby\n\nWhen it was time to apply to college, they had this debate. Daphne wanted to go for a Latina scholarship bc she grew up Latina essentially and the characters debated whether or not she should. Of course, Daphne was Latina having grown up Latina just not ethnically Latina. \n\nSo Daphne qualified for the scholarship, but she felt bad when she meant other applicants who were all ethnically Latina and spoke on their experiences and struggles from being ethnically Latina specifically - so she felt bad bc she didn't experience anything like that and I think I remember she felt like she didn't need the scholarship the same way \n\nPersonally I would just examine what you feel you need and how you identify bc you're valid either way. If you do pass as white it doesn't make you not native American. It's all up to you", "NTA.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm white. But I grew up in a region with a lot of First Nations and Inuit people, and have heard thoughts on this sort of situation from First Nations classmates & coworkers, including people who were still directly involved with their tribe & traditional culture, and those who weren't.\n\nYour reasoning for not citing the Native vein of your family history feels very fair. You say you're 1/8 Native and not connected with the culture; in your shoes, I'd feel uneasy about listing myself as Native under those circumstances too. I know people who are half First Nations who don't check the box because of cultural disconnect. It's down to each individual person to do what feels comfortable and *honest* to themselves. Which you did. You don't have an emotional or experience-based connection to this side of your heritage, so it feels disingenuous to use it for your advantage. That makes sense to me.\n\nPeople in the comments are saying you should take advantage of any boost you can, and that universities want 'diversity applications'--and that's true. But I don't know... a lot of colleges/universities and workplaces tend to hit their quota of 'diversity applicants' and then start rejecting people pell mell (unfortunately something I've seen irl), and in your position, I'd be worried that if I checked the box it might contribute to the shouldering-out of someone who's more immediately connected with their tribe and culture and had to grow up dealing directly with the racism & systemic oppression that in all likelihood you haven't had to contend with yourself.", "i was literally you a little over 20 years ago, one of the biggest mistakes of my life.  so much of the admissions and financing side of college is a giant shit heap, you're applying ethics to a situation that doesn't call for it.", " NAH\u2014 I\u2019m 1/8 African and I note my heritage as white because I benefit from white privilege and don\u2019t feel connected to the culture of the country that part of my family is from (they are not descendants of enslaved people but immigrants from Africa), so I definitely sympathize, but I also get why your mom feels how she does about it. Honestly I don\u2019t think you would be wrong however you decided. It could however help your family out if you could apply for special scholarships that you are entitled to.", "That was dumb. You should have been honest. Does not matter where you live. You should use advantages when you can.", "^this. I agree 100%", "I don\u2019t think anyone who wasn\u2019t involved is owed anything", "This is my advice too! OP you should take every advantage available to you. There is nothing unethical about accepting a benefit that you qualify for."]}
