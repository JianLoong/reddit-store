My girlfriend has met my parents but only knows what they tell her.\n\nLast Saturday we went on a date to this fancy bakery with plans to go for dinner later. So we're waiting in line and I offered to get desserts for after dinner and she suggested that I get one for my mom. I saw a small tart that I know she'll eat so I was going to order it for her.\n\nMy girlfriend said that my mom would probably like this strawberry cheesecake more. I said, no she doesn't like cheesecake. She said \"if she tried this one, she'll like it\". I repeated myself again and again my girlfriend argued that she would change her mind if she tried this bakery's cheesecake. After about 1 more round of this, I snapped (not yelled) \"my mom doesn't like that stuff, just leave it alone\". She was quiet after that.\n\nOn the ride back from the bakery, I apologized for snapping. I said that I snapped because I told her that my mom wouldn't like it and I could have handled it better. All she said to me was \"just take me home\". So I took her home and haven't heard back in about 8 days now. I texted after a day, saying we should talk about this but all I got was radio silence.\n\ntl;dr: Girlfriend kept insisting that I get my mom a dessert that I know she'll hate. I snapped after my girlfriend kept pushing for me to get the dessert. I apologized in the car but now she's ghosting me and I'm starting to think I did something that's a dealbreaker.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695772100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16t4bsd/aita_for_snapping_at_my_girlfriend_in_public_over/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think the dealbreaker is *eight days* of the silent treatment when you are in a 2 year relationship. That is in no way commensurate with the argument you had.", "NTA\n\nYour gf is thin-skinned. What you did was in no way a deal-breaker. There may be something else going on with your gf, some past history, trauma, I don't know, but what you did wasn't anything egregious.

You have apologized, but if she won't talk with you, what else can you do?", "Eight days of [silent treatment](https://psychcentral.com/health/the-silent-treatment#is-it-abuse) because you got a bit snappy with someone who repeatedly refused to listen to reason...\n\nThere's an asshole here, but it ain't you OP. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Why would she think that she knows your mom better. It was sweet of her to recommend something but that\u2019s that. She should\u2019ve left it be and not stop pushing it. Maybe she wants to be on your moms good side and really wanted to give her something from her? But, at the same time it\u2019s just not right for her to be ignoring you after that, why is she making you feel bad about getting a dessert you knew your mom would like? That\u2019s quite literally your mother, someone who you know best.", "NTA. Im not sure why she thought she could change your moms mind about something she flat out doesn't like. You tried to be calm about it multiple times but she insisted so you assertively told her to drop it, You even apologised. The fact that shes been ignoring you for OVER A WEEK because of this is absolutely wild. Has she had problems with communication in the past? Also, have you tried going to her house to confront her about ignoring you for so long over something so small?

She turned it into a fight, not you.\n\nWhen things are calmer it might be worth trying to find out why your GF was so set on an option you knew wasn't appropriate.", "NTA - it sounds like she didn\u2019t understand that just because she thinks it\u2019s amazing cheesecake, not everyone is going to enjoy it. I\u2019m also not a cheesecake fan - if you brought me that, it wouldn\u2019t really feel like a thoughtful treat. \n\nI\u2019ve had people do this to me with other things, for instance I do not like musicals or plays at all. Been to a bunch, never enjoyed them at all. But every now and then someone is like \u201cOh, but have you seen THIS one? I bet you\u2019d like THIS one. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d And I\u2019ll reply \u201cNo, it just isn\u2019t my thing.\u201d Do they let it go? Nope.

Hope it's soon!", "NTA it\u2019s good to put her in her place girls loves it", "NAH for either of you. Just a small disagreement and no it is not a deal breaker. You should try to set up a time to talk about what happened so you can understand each others perspective on what happened. Maybe she really wanted your mom to try cheesecake because she likes it and wants your nother to also try it. She shouldn\u2019t have pushed it and you didn\u2019t need to snap, but it happened and now you guys just need to discuss and move on because this is not a huge deal unless other things are also happening. If she makes it a big deal after you try too talk it out then she would be the asshole.", "She was sweet for suggesting it in the first place. Just give her a chance to explain why she\u2019s so hurt. She\u2019s sensitive but based on this considerate as well.", "ESH You don\u2019t have a girlfriend anymore.", "NTA. This could definitely have been handled better on both sides, as it wouldn't have killed you to by a slice of cheesecake. But of course your GF gets the brunt of the blame for insisting so much.", "YTA. You could've explained in a polite tone. Your gf probably knows the stuff at that bakery and just like for your mom to try it.", "YTA.  I get why you snapped at her.  But your apology was garbage.  You basically said, \u201csorry, but you made me do it.\u201d\n\nShe was being annoying.  That doesn\u2019t give you the right to snap at her, embarrassing her in public.  But people make mistakes.  The fact that you took no ownership over your actions when apologizing is what sucks.", "NTA yes maybe you could have handled it better. I wish you would have thought to let your girlfriend be the one to give your mom the dessert of her choosing \u201chi I got this for you, I thought you\u2019d like it \u201c", "She seems immature and you definitely shouldn\u2019t have snapped at her. You have to apologize for snapping like that, but she also should listen better. 8 days of silence just sounds like lack of communication skills. I think you both should apologize to eachother and recognize that you both should communicate better.", "Strange argument but NTA\n\nOut of curiosity did you ask if SHE wanted the cheesecake?", "Lol girls like this are ridiculous and can\u2019t handle the the smallest amount of confrontation which isn\u2019t healthy at all. And here I full on scream back at my 6ft man lol", "YTA this literally couldve been resolved with just getting both for your mom and entertaining your girlfriend's suggestion of gesture to your mom. Also whether you did more than youre saying or not when you snapped doesnt change the fact that youre aware of her trauma and gave a really shitty apology after embarrassing her (at minimum) in public over cheesecake. You need to apologize better and just entertain her thoughts. Her persistence sure is annoying but this isnt worth damaging a mostly fine relationship over (if thats the case) especially with a partner that your parents enjoy and are close with.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Perhaps just get both desserts, let her give it to your mom because she was \u201cthinking of her\u201d then save the tart for later. \n\nAlthough you did apologize. She\u2019s ghosting you now. Is this a normal thing for her? If so, wait it out. If not, you might want to reevaluate the relationship.", "Also hate cheesecake & have heard too many times \"you'll love this one\" \"this one is different\". They are all nasty. But guessing something else is going on because recommending the cheesecake is normal, but that should have been the end of it with a mental note for her for next time to not buy cheesecake for any future family dinners.", "yeah, the ghosting has been getting progressively worse the last year or so.\n\nMaybe her ghosting is a good thing.\n\nE: honestly it could have cut both ways. She could have asked \"what does your mom like then\" but I have no clue why she was so insistent on the cake.", "It seems you have some things to work out. I hope she stops ghosting you so you can, but if she doesn\u2019t just take the loss and move on."]}
