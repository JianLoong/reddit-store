My bf added me to the group chat about a month ago, I guess as an invitation or to let me know they were all wanting to go.

I don\u2019t have the PTO. Bf keeps saying to just take unpaid time off and that\u2019s what the higher ups do to take their long vacations anyways. This is my first real job and it took me 1.5 years to land it after uni, so I\u2019m hesitant to do anything that might get me fired.\nI asked some basic questions. Where are we staying? How and when are we going and how and when do we get back? What are we going to eat? All met with \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\nSpontaneity is fine, though not preferred. Money isn\u2019t the biggest issue. Based on my calculations, if I went for the only day I can go, it would\u2019ve costed around $500. The problem for me is the timing and the language barrier. Everyone can speak English, but they prefer speaking in their Native language, leaving me feeling like a third wheel. When they speak english, it\u2019s just to me. I\u2019ve discussed this language barrier with bf as this isn\u2019t my first time feeling left out and his only solution is if I just learn his language to be able to talk with everyone.\nFor these reasons, I said I didn\u2019t want to go but didn\u2019t stop bf from going. Bf didn\u2019t want to go without me and now everyone has canceled the trip because of me and kicked me from the group chat.\nAt the end, bf asked me why I couldn\u2019t just get along with his friends and asked why him being there with me wasn\u2019t enough.

Why is there a need for two trips so close together? And during the holiday season no less, when everything gets jacked up price wise. It sounds like they\u2019re completely inconsiderate, bf included. It\u2019s good that you stood your ground! Dont second guess yourself simply cause bf said it was your fault when it wasnt. If the whole trip was actually cancelled just because you said no, it sounds like it was more counting on the money youd put in than wanting to spend time with you as a person :(", "Why can't bf go without you?", "NTA,\n\nYou didn't want to go, you shouldn't have felt forced to.  There was no reason the rest of them had to cancel their trip nor should they lay that at your feet.", "NTA. Being overwhelmed by the language barrier aside\u2014not that it isn't important to your decision\u2014you are being rushed to accept a plan that has been changed last minute from a date that was acceptable to something that would now be a worry to you. You are fine not going\u2014and don't worry about being kicked from the group chat. You weren't being considered anyway, or they would never have sprung a last minute change without checking with you first.", "NTA - you said he could go and he didn't want to. Don't let boyfriends tell you what is okay for you to do at work. It's not professional to just not come back when you say you're going to be there. Maybe the higher ups do it - but, they are higher up. They don't do it at my job. Often the longer you are at a job, the more vacation you earn. Higher ups are there longer, they earn more vacation.\n\nThey are rude to speak in a language you don't understand, especially if there is a common language they can speak.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You'd be too tired to come in the next day / be tired from driving back from the trip.\n\nThey could have gone without you.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nThat's the joy of an invitation.  It isn't a requirement.  So when you bow out (you don't throw a massive fit) and your BF's group cancels the trip and kicks you from the chat, you think *you* are being dramatic???  Oh honey....", "Originally it was a planned trip in February, but they spontaneously wanted to move it to tomorrow. Counting on my money isn\u2019t something I considered before, but now I\u2019m concerned.", "He says everyone going is going as a couple. He also wants me to hangout with his friends. It\u2019s a bit difficult for me to bridge the conversation gap though.", "They got into a couple group calls before making the change to tomorrow.

I just learned my bf doesn\u2019t get PTO, which is probably why he\u2019s suggesting I take unpaid time off.", "Okay so its the same trip moved closer, it\u2019s still weird though. To be so impatient to move a trip closer than before? As far as the money goes, unfortunately its how lots of adult trips are, things are split financially between the people attending and prices go up the less people there are. However, when these trips are initiated, theres usually LOTS of communication among everyone because everyones paying a portion (i.e transport, flights, location, bnb or hotels) Do you have any of those details or was it more of \u201cyou pay $x\u201d? If the latter I would definitely consider you more of a wallet than a friend attending.", "And if he were single, he wouldn't go on this trip? I don't think his intentions are bad, but you going to this thing \"is not that serious\". Unpaid PTO to hang out with his friends? Come on.", "We\u2019re sharing the costs, but none of the details weren\u2019t even answered this afternoon. Bf is my only useful translator at this point, but I\u2019m not getting much outside of \u201cWe\u2019re gonna figure it out.\u201d So if there\u2019s actually a plan, I wouldn\u2019t know.", "Then yeah id be careful with your money :( think of it as an investment, you would want details before you put your money into it. What happens if something goes wrong and all your money is just gone, it\u2019s also very telling bf is willing to wrap you up into it", "That\u2019s the main reason I don\u2019t really like spontaneous trips, especially this sudden."]}
