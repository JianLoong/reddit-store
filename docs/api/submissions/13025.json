I\u2019m autistic with a neurotypical girlfriend, and we sometimes run into the same conflict. \n\nLet me help you see the other side of the issue: constantly having to explain yourself is exhausting. Life already requires so much thinking as it is. Why should I have to spend my time explaining to you why I do things the way I do them?

You say you ask other ppl questions and they just say idk or because i wanted to. those do not actually explain reasoning or basis behind decision making. yet you expect your gf to provide similar responses? but then you would still not understand her action? you do not gain anything from asking anyone these questions, so why do you keep asking them? i would likely get upset if i were her YTA", "YTA you sound exhausting.", "YTA.

Why is your post only one paragraph?\n\nYou might think that these questions can just be brushed off, but whenever you ask your gf questions she has to pause a bit to wonder if you are actually concerned what her answer would be or if it's your usual shallow questioning that means nothing (you really don't care what her answer is, you're just blurting out words without thinking) and is wasting her mental energy to have to respond to.\n\nBut it's obvious she (mistakenly) thinks you are asking about things that mean something to you, so she has to think of the meaning behind your questions and why you are asking her about the things she does.
