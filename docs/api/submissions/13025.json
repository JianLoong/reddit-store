I\u2019m autistic with a neurotypical girlfriend, and we sometimes run into the same conflict. \n\nLet me help you see the other side of the issue: constantly having to explain yourself is exhausting. Life already requires so much thinking as it is. Why should I have to spend my time explaining to you why I do things the way I do them? Unless what I\u2019m doing is negatively impacting you in some way, just let me do what I do and let me be me. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. You sound insufferable tbh, and yes, it is 100% criticism not just innocent questions.

She doesn't want to have to justify or explain herself over trivial things.\n\nShe asked you to stop, you aren't stopping, YTA", "All your example questions are absolutely judgmental. They're also based on the way you, a neurotypical person, would do things and come off as criticizing the way she, someone on the autism spectrum, does things as if your way is right/normal  and her way is wrong/abnormal. More importantly,  she asked you to stop which should be respected. YTA", "YTA. That sounds annoying and exhausting. And you know she doesn't like it, so fucking stop. It sounds like it's probably annoying to other people as well, but it doesn't bother them as much because they don't spend as much time with you. Let her be without questioning every little thing she does.", "YTA. The implication is that if you didn\u2019t find the behavior strange or abnormal, you wouldn\u2019t need to ask about why she\u2019s doing it, so since you\u2019re asking, it\u2019s a veiled criticism. Either let her be herself without the interrogation, or find ways to move on. Everyone is different and no one owes you any explanations.", "Why are you asking so many questions like that anyways? id get pretty pissed if someone was questioning and judging every single thing i\u2019m doing. Maybe it\u2019s your tone when you\u2019re asking that makes her feel that way too. Also it may come off as condescending as if you think you\u2019re better than her.

You say you ask other ppl questions and they just say idk or because i wanted to. those do not actually explain reasoning or basis behind decision making. yet you expect your gf to provide similar responses? but then you would still not understand her action? you do not gain anything from asking anyone these questions, so why do you keep asking them? i would likely get upset if i were her YTA", "YTA you sound exhausting.", "YTA.

You failed on that mark.  Also, the fact that she's autistic she just does things a certain way that might be different and can't explain why.

It sounds like you're asking her a lot of questions, and while it may not be your intention to criticize her, it's understandable that she feels like you are.

You should try to be more mindful of how you phrase things and be aware that she may interpret your questions differently than you intend them.", "YTA so you're asking a lot of simple questions as in you question her every move? Just imagine for a second you're not in the picture and she goes about her day doing whatever however and is getting along, everything is good. Now there's somebody in her ear making it seem her every move is somehow not \"normal\". Intention aside it's just not ok to making somebody explain (justify) everything they do and how they do it. The fact that the questions are so \"simple\" makes it actually worse. Like she can't even cross a street without you making it seem weird.

How would you feel if you never asked the question and just accepted that people do things differently than you? Would it be upsetting to you?\n\nIf there was truly, honestly, from the bottom of your soul, zero judgment - why do you call the things she does 'strange' or 'questionable' ?

Neurodivergent people can\u2019t always articulate the \u2018why\u2019 behind our actions.

It sounds like you\u2019re talking to an unreliable child. I wouldn\u2019t stand for it.", "YTA \n\nAll these questions imply that she is doing something wrong. Especially since they are not even formulated in a factual and neutral way. \"Always so many\", or directly attaching an unasked alternative to it etc. Your questions are factual criticism and that others don't take them personally but go over them doesn't change anything.\n\nBut it is even worse not to stop even after she has expressed her displeasure and you know that she has a background where she is more affected by such things.", "YTA for not valuing your partner\u2019s feelings.

No one expects or even wants the Spanish Inquisition when they are just living their lives.", "YTA. Why are you doing something completely unnecessary that you know upsets her?

Just stop it.", "YTA imagine for a minute that you view the world different than almost everyone around you. Say for example your version of purple is everyone\u2019s green. Now say your GF asks you why do you always wear green with red and not black? Why do you always pause when the light turns green. \n\nYour girlfriend knows she views the world from a different lens. For a lot of ND persons this is filled with shame. Many of us want nothing more than to be normal. So when people question us on why we do this or that it feels like added judgment. It also feels like the people we love can\u2019t accept us as we are because she aren\u2019t good enough to be like everyone else.\n\nSo ask yourself if you had a friend you knew was color blind would you constantly ask questions related to their choices involving color?

You really should be able to stop asking the questions since you know they bother her. Do you even like her?", "YTA. What you\u2019re doing is completely unnecessary.

For one, it's annoying having people ask you why you do something especially when it's mundane things. Why do you need to know those things? Why does it matter to you where she chooses to walk or what she chooses to carry?\n\nI get it if it's asking just once in a while but based on the fact that she feels you're criticizing her, I'm guessing it's pretty frequent.

Why do you type \"I'm\" as \"im\" and \"don't\" as \"dont\" without an apostrophe? Why didn't you use the correct \"it's\" instead of \"its\"? Why did you use an apostrophe in \"they're\" and \"she's\" but not elsewhere? Why is your post only one paragraph?\n\nYou might think that these questions can just be brushed off, but whenever you ask your gf questions she has to pause a bit to wonder if you are actually concerned what her answer would be or if it's your usual shallow questioning that means nothing (you really don't care what her answer is, you're just blurting out words without thinking) and is wasting her mental energy to have to respond to.\n\nBut it's obvious she (mistakenly) thinks you are asking about things that mean something to you, so she has to think of the meaning behind your questions and why you are asking her about the things she does. Unfortunately the easiest explanation is that you think what she does is \"the wrong way\". That for you to accept what she does, you need her to explain to you the reason she did it that certain way, forcing her to defend herself every time you ask.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

He's observed me do things differently than other people since we met and he never understood the reasoning behind them. Sometimes he's just curious why I do things differently. He also likes to hear how I think about things because it is different from other people and it teaches him new things and gives him an alternative viewpoint.\n\nI don't think it's inherently wrong of you to ask those questions because it makes sense for you to ask questions when you notice something done differently than how you usually see it done. It's just human curiosity and a lot of people do it about a lot of things. If people didn't ask questions, there would be no Google.\n\nHowever, when it gets to the point when she tells you it bothers her, that's when you need to stop. It's not the questions that are the problem, it's going past her established boundary.\n\nAnd please understand that as an autistic woman, she probably does get questioned all the time about little things she does and unlike when you ask, sometimes people do actually ask those questions as a way to condescend her. I have been made fun of my entire life for doing things differently than other people and typically when anyone brings it up, it's to make fun of me. So understand that you also have to consider her history / experience with people asking questions about inconsequential things she does.\n\nAlso, I saw some of your other comments and I think you might want to get evaluated yourself. In my experience with neurotypicals, they don't usually have that child like curiosity and they tend to follow unspoken social rules more strictly, or at least understand them better. The way you are innocently asking people questions here, continuously asking your girlfriend questions about things you're curious about, that you say you speak in a monotone, those are symptoms of some autistic people. Please do not do the online quizzes, you need to get properly evaluated if you are interested in following that path.

(Asking questions at a conference doesn\u2019t make the questioner judgmental. Nor would asking a question of a bartender to understand what they\u2019re doing.) It could be argued though that the fact he\u2019s asking so, so much is evidence for judgment.", "I just don't see it as nitpicking or judgmental and I don't know if I'm going to change my opinion based on this thread. I would probably have to explore this idea deeper and come to my own conclusions in order to change my opinion on it, rather than just changing it because of what other people are saying. I know a lot of people say impact over intent but I've never really understood that because for me, intent is part of the impact. I've been in this girlfriend's shoes and it bothered me until I understood why it was happening, and then it didn't bother me anymore.\n\nI'm autistic and I believe my husband is too, he's already diagnosed ADD when he was a young child but I believe that could be wrong, as it was wrong for me. And he and I do have that back and forth with questions. It's just part of our relationship. My husband is a very intense \"why\" person and it did feel like judging for a long time, until I realized that he likes to understand things, he's a researcher and a tinkerer and he needs to dive deep into things to understand them because that's just how his brain works.\n\nMy husband still asks me a lot of questions but we've had more open conversations about it and he knows they bother me sometimes and he has also communicated to me that he's asking questions about me because he cares about me and he wants to know why I am the way I am. Him asking questions has made me pause and think, which is part of the reason I got evaluated in the first place, among other things. But he also told me that it's how he shows love, if he wasn't interested then it would mean he didn't care. He loves my idiosyncrasies, so personally don't see a problem with him asking questions.\n\nI understand that OP could be coming at this from the same place that my husband does it, which is why I'm trying to defend OP a little bit. The girlfriend is justified too, I just don't think anyone is being intentionally malicious here.", "Yes, I'm not disagreeing with that. It's not the curiosity that's causing the problem, it's the fact that she has told him to stop and he keeps doing it. When someone says no or stop and you keep doing that action repeatedly, that is bad no matter what the action is. His girlfriend has a right to consent to any of their interactions, whether they are physical or verbal or sexual or whatever.", "I agree on the difference in intent. I'm autistic and I can't always read everyone's intentions clearly but I have learned through experience that NDs ask questions out of a genuine curiosity to completely understand how everything works around them. I usually scare away NTs before they start asking a lot of questions but the ones who have asked me questions did have a different tone and diction than the NDs I've been around. I am not sure how they meant it but the tone definitely felt condescending.", "I'm not diagnosing him or trying to diagnose him, I'm informing him that his behavior could be a small part of a larger picture that might be worth investigating, in case he's never heard that before. I wish someone had told me I might be on the spectrum when I was his age, it would have changed my life.\n\nI don't think people being steadfast, stubborn, inconsiderate, obstinate, whatever other word you want to use, is automatically nerdivergent. I do think it's offensive to automatically assume someone has a condition because they're acting like an a******, because yes that does lump the rest of us in with those people. Personally, I hate the notion that autistics lack empathy, it's not true scientifically and it is dehumanizing.\n\nI said this in other comments but they probably got buried in the thread, but I see more nuance than that in this situation. I see OP's behavior and it immediately makes me think of why he might be acting that way, which I've seen first hand in my personal life with an intimate partner. My husband is a \"why\" person. It's not the question asking or being rude and violating boundaries that makes me think he might be autistic, it's his inability to stop and understand social cues, and shut down his own morbid curiosity. It's the inability to control it that makes me think something else. Kind of like most people drink alcohol at some point in their lifetime, but if you're unable to stop drinking alcohol, that is when you're considered an alcoholic. It's not drinking the alcohol, it's being unable to stop drinking it.\n\nOn its face, yes, he is the AH. But I spent the first 28 years of my life being the AH because everyone assigned incorrect motivations to my words and actions, and thought I was doing things intentionally. Everyone thought I could just turn it off whenever I wanted, that I was in complete control and that I was choosing to negatively impact those around me. People saw the word or the action and they applied their own line of thinking to it and blamed me as a result. It took 27 of those years for me to realize that other people can control those things and I cannot. It wasn't until after my diagnosis that I could adequately communicate to my loved ones that I was suffering alongside them because I was not in control, I was not doing those things intentionally because if I could turn that part of me off, I would have done it years ago. So that is what I'm recognizing in OP. And I'm responding to it because he's getting shredded and I know what it's like to get torn pieces for doing things that bother other people even though you can't stop yourself.", "I'm not neurotypical, so I wouldn't know.

What are they going to do to you?\"\n\nI said \"dude, that's not your business\" and kind of dragged him away.

What was your actual score? The results are given as a number and the classifications are a range, so were you in the middle of your range, at the bottom, at the top? Have you ever considered that you might be ND in some other form?

I didn't mean to make any of my comments sound like I think he should keep asking her the questions. Whether it's asking questions or XYZ, once the other person withdraws consent or expresses discomfort, it's time to stop, no matter what it is. So it's not the asking the questions that's bad, it's the going past her established boundary that's bad.\n\nAnd yes, maybe this will be the forum that not only gets him to stop berating her but also gets him to take a more introspective look at himself and look into whether or not he might also be autistic.\n\nI don't want to assign YTA here because I think it's nuanced. If he truly was neurotypical, I'd say YTA, quit picking on your autistic girlfriend. But his language screams ND to me, so I don't want to be harsh on him. If he's pushing these boundaries for fun, he needs to stop because that's wrong. If he truly can't control it, then it gets into a different area.", "I was also diagnosed at 28, I realized I might be on the spectrum when I was 27 and it took me about 9 months to find someone who tested adults. I became great at masking, which is very common not only for females but for people who were diagnosed later in life, as you mentioned. But OP could be taking off the mask in front of his girlfriend and that is what's causing this issue.\n\nBecause I can empathize with where he's coming from. I recognize in his post some of the behaviors my husband has also exhibited, much to my dismay and the discomfort of many people around us in the past, and when I learned why he's like that, I was able to give him more compassion and it didn't bother me as much. I know I have been that thorn in everyone else's side many times in my life, just like OP is now to his girlfriend. And I think if we all shut him down, he could miss an opportunity to understand himself better.\n\nIf he truly is neurotypical, he should be able to take the feedback from this thread, learn something/gain an alternative viewpoint, and implement it immediately. He should be able to just stop asking those questions. If he can't and he keeps doing it even though he knows it's wrong, then I think it's indicative of something else.\n\nI want to say, because I've mentioned it in other buried replies but it may not be obvious here, I understand where the girlfriend is coming from. My husband used to do the same thing to me and it drove me absolutely insane and yes, it did make me feel like I was being criticized for everything. I didn't realize until much later that my husband loves that I'm different, because it did feel like he was judging me the same way everyone else has judged me.\n\nAsking questions is not bad, violating someone's boundaries is. I don't think the question part is the problem, I think continuing to do it after she has revoked consent and expressed her discomfort is the problem. I'm not saying there's not a problem here, I'm saying this conflict could be arising from him displaying ND traits and not understanding himself well enough.", "Are you saying that that autistic traits probably don't differ based on assigned sex at birth but rather how gender is perceived and treated within a society or family unit, and how someone's experiences shape them? I don't think science knows enough about autistic females to understand if it actually affects them differently as the root cause or if they display the symptoms differently as a result or effect of their upbringing. From the few articles I've read on gender as it pertains to social interaction in children, it seems like it has been very difficult to isolate children enough to fully understand if it is innate or cultural. I think it's probably cultural. The \"study\" I'm thinking of was when a sociologist homeschooled his child in a gender-neutral environment with gender-neutral toys, gender-neutral everything, and the first time the child came home from public school, she wanted a Barbie doll.\n\nI am also an autistic female. I consider myself a woman but mainly because I don't give a shit either way and that's what I grew up with. If I woke up as a dude tomorrow, it wouldn't bother me. If my husband woke up as a woman tomorrow, it wouldn't bother me. I truly don't care either way.", "It's not common sense. I basically got punished for nearly 30 years every time I acted autistic.

Saying things like \"why would you do xyz\" \"why do you always have so much stuff\" \"why would you do this not that\" are judgmental questions! In therapy I learned that saying stuff like \"why do you always /never\" any kind of absolute like that is not helpful and leads people to be defensive. That's what you're doing. You're even using the absolutes. \n\nThese types of questions have an implied idea of what you think is the right thing and criticism of what the person is doing and doesn't lead to positive communication. Plus, you've already admitted that you find her behaviors strange so is it that confusing that if you're asking someone questions because you've already deemed their behavior weird, that the questions themselves would reveal this???\n\nWe all can be annoyed so ask judgmental questions, but the issue is denying it and acting innocent. I know when what I'm asking is from an annoyed place and if my partner is hurt by it, I can at least reflect and am self aware enough to say yea, I was confused and irritated by them doing XYZ so my question probably came off that way. The frustration and what can feel like manipulation is trying to feign complete innocent and neutrality and acting like the other person is crazy or too sensitive when your questions are in fact judgmental and asked at times when you're clearly irritated by them. That you confessed this part is reason enough to own that your questions might not be as innocent as you're making them out to be. \n\nI suggest you think more about either learning what curiosity and truly open questions are versus judgment and criticism framed as questions. And also, perhaps think about why you're constantly asking these questions. If your gf bothers you that much that you ask such questions often, perhaps be with someone else, as no one wants to feel like their partner is constantly annoyed or confused by them and is constantly questioning them about every little thing. And if you're doing this to your family and friends and they brush it off, perhaps also wonder why you've chosen this style of communication that seems to alienate others.", "My sister does this.

Will there likely be a logical answer to my question and not just an \"idk that's just how I do this thing\"? Will asking this question and receiving an answer truly satiate me? If so, tell your gf why you want to know. Even try phrasing it in a better way than an interrogation: \"Wow, I never would've thought to do it that way. That's interesting!
