They have been together for 8years know and his girlfriend are great frinds, she is extremely nice and has helped me through so much. Last year my cousin , who we'll call m, and his girlfriend, who we'll call h, came over to my house while my parents were out with my siblings, they did that often and still do. While they were over h complimented the ring I had one saying it was gorgeous.\nI got the ring from my nan, my mum's mother, my cousin is in my dad side so he has never met my nan. My nan is still with us but she lives very far away and before she moved she gave me the ring for my birthday. It's a beautiful ring with a gold band and an intricate pattern madew ith diamonds.\n\nLast week m came to visit and while we were eating dinner he asked if I could give him the ring to propose to h with. I said no. Again, it is a beautiful ring but I wouldn't consider it an engagement ring. I asked why he thought it was okay to ask to have it and he said it was because of that time h complimented it. I explained that I would not give hime the ring and he started yelling at me.\n\nAfter he left I started getting calls from my dad's side of the family telling me I was a terrible cousin, turns out he lies to my family but after my parents explained what really happened they apologized. My grandma told me that she didn't think by I would do something like that but my grandad, who is much older then her and losing himself a bit, did. I don't blame him.\nToday h came over and said she broke up with m because if what he did and how he was talking about me after what happened.\n\nMy cousin's friends are mad at me for breaking up the relationship but I really don't know.\n\nAITA for not giving him the ring?\n\nUPADATE:\nI would like to thank everyone in the post for support and kind words, it does mean a lot.\n\nI would like to add some things. First off, my cousin could more than afford a nice ring for h as he makes just over 150k per year and h (after a recent rais) is making 190k a year. They had a savings account together and separately. H has taken her share of that after they broke up. Another thing, he told the family that he bought me the ring and let me borrow it for a dance (I've never been to a dance) and then I refused to give it back to him.\n\nThe ring was given to my nan by her late partner, he was gifted it from a young lady who lived where he was stationed during WWII.\n\nAs far as I'm aware m didn't have a lying problem growing up but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nLast thing, h seems much happier out of the relationship and has promised she'll still be a part of my life, I have a few major events taking place next year so I really want her to be a part of them.\n\nAgain thank you to everyone for support!!", "created_utc": 1670815324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjl9vk/aita_for_not_giving_my_cousin_a_ring_i_got_from/", "score": 180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a sentimental piece from your grandmother, who is not also his grandmother, idk in what world he thought you'd just hand it over to him. Just block anyone who is trying to make you feel bad, you don't owe him anything.", "NTA. He is not entitled to your ring.

This was a gift from your grandmother and he had absolutely no right to it. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why your dads family started insulting you? What did your cousin say to them?\n\nBut OP. You didn\u2019t break up their relationship, your cousin did with his manipulative, cheap and evil behaviour.", "NTA  that's not how engagement rings work. You don't get to pick a ring someone else owns because you like it and demand they hand their ring over. It even weirder than he's not related to your nan and is asking for a ring she gave you.  It's unclear if it's an heirloom, but he has no rights to it either way.", "NTA\u2014 if Nan is your grandmother, she passed it down to you\u2014a direct female descendent.  \n\nThe ring was never your cousin\u2019s to give to his Girlfriend.

If he couldn't afford to go to a store and purchase a ring then he had no right to propose to someone to spend his life with them.

Your cousin is trying to manipulate you into giving them an heirloom that was never meant for them. \n\nIf you gave in, he\u2019d keep trying to take from you, some people feel entitled to things that aren\u2019t theirs. \n\nKeep the ring, your Nan wants YOU to have it", "He can't afford a ring, wants to recycle the first thing H randomly complimented on, get's mad at the fact that this isn't working, starts to spread lies out of spite and then blames a teenager for \"ruining his relationship\"?

It\u2019s nice that he was paying attention to what his gf likes, but it\u2019s an insane stretch to then feel entitled to then ASK FOR THAT OBJECT. I like my cousin\u2019s house? Should my bf ASK THEM FOR THEIR HOUSE FOR MY CHRISTMAS GIFT? My guess is he was paying attention to any mentions she had about jewelry, went to go find one in store, realized he couldn\u2019t afford what she liked and decided to hit up HIS TEENAGE COUSIN FOR THEIR RING. NTA at all for turning him down and clarifying his lies to the rest of the family. It\u2019s probably for the better, this type of entitled, greedy, lying behaviour showed his GF enough red flags to back out early.", "NTA. This was one of the easiest ever. If he can't get her a ring other than pressuring his 14 yr old cousin for it, he shouldn't be proposing.

If your nan was his grandmother as well I could see MAYBE being justified in ASKING nicely if you would let him propose with it but even that is a stretch. But since he had absolutely no connection whatsoever to the ring it\u2019s just insane that he felt so entitled to it.\n\nI suspect this behavior was not the only reason H decided to end the relationship. He\u2019s probably displayed behavior like this around her before and this might have been the final straw.", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t break up the relationship \n\nShe left him because he wanted to propose to her with a \u201cfree\u201d ring that he bullied off his 14 year old cousin showing she was worth exactly $0 of his effort! \n\nThis was obviously not the first time he showed her what he thought of her\n\nNot on you!", "NTA. Your cousin can buy his own ring and you\u2019re not responsible for breaking up his relationship. He\u2019s pretty entitled thinking that he could get a ring from the side of your family he\u2019s not even related to!", "NTA.  Your cousin broke up his own relationship by being a total jerk.  Sounds like H had a narrow escape.", "NTA.\n\nIf you complimented his car/house is he then obligated to give it to you?", "Absolutely not!!! It was your ring given to you by your grandmother because she loves you. It has nothing to do with him. He can save up and buy an engagement ring just like everyone else does. He is not entitled to your ring just because he wants it.", "Honestly, what? Messy chaos you do not need", "NTA. Make sure that your parents thoroughly spread the truth that the ring is a MATERNAL heirloom so there is no way a PATERNAL cousin could have gotten it for you. Make sure BOTH sides of your family know this has happened for in case there is another connection between the families other than your immediate family. Since it did come from your nan, who does not have any relation to that cousin, perhaps you can ask her to hold on to it for you for a time. Let her know that you are afraid that your cousin will try to get that ring from you, perhaps by force or by breaking into the house to steal it, so you are asking her to keep it safe for you for the time being and that you will ask for its return once you feel safe and comfortable that you will not be losing that ring. I get that means that shipping the ring from one place to another will be involved, but that would be preferable to losing the ring completely to someone undeserving (your cousin). Whatever you decide to do, make sure that ring is completely inaccessible to your cousin whenever you and he might be in the same space. Be it a family reunion, or other event you both may be attending, do not have the ring but keep it in.a safe deposit box or somewhere similar that the cousin will not have access to it or even know where it is. In the event that you may end up in a situation that you didn't know he would be there, perhaps take to wearing a chain that you keep tucked inside your shirt so that no-one will question your wearing the chain and then slip away to take the ring off and put it on the hidden chain. If there are ANY family members that are believing and siding with your cousin, do not have the ring accessible to them either, because they may also try to take the ring from you on your cousins behalf. As for your cousin's friends, ignore them or tell them the truth about the ring although they will undoubtedly believe your cousin over you since they are his friends. Leave it to your parents and the rest of your paternal family to correct the friends. If ANYONE tries to gaslight you about the ring (saying this wouldn't have happened if you had just given him the ring, or to just give him the ring and everyone will stop bothering you, etc.), tell them it's your ring and not theirs so back off and leave you alone. If gaslighting does happen, tell your parents about the incident(s) so that they can throw their weight as your parents behind you.", "NTA\nYour cousin seems to be crazy.", "NTA. H is sweet. Deserves better than your cousin. It\u2019s a good thing they broke up. He was too cheap to buy a ring and wanted to take yours.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin is not entitled to a gift your gran gave to you that was clearly intended for you.\n\nOh, and look, his \"love\" broke up with him over not getting this ring?!?!?!?! You did the boy a favor. Good riddance.\n\nOn top of that, he clearly has some maturing to do before he gets married.", "Seriously, I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around how he thought it was okay to come and demand a ring that was not even from his side of the family just because his girlfriend complimented it once. The only reason I can think for doing this is that he cant afford a ring. But even if that\u2019s the case, it doesn\u2019t excuse his actions. op, Nta.", "Or his IQ apparently", "As far as I'm aware he told them that he caught me the ring recently", "The ring was a gift from her late partner, not married but my mother's father when they first started dating, he died long before I was born. The ring was given to him while her served in the second world war from someone where he was stationed", "Thank you for your input and I'm happy to say that even just a few days out of the relationship h seems much happier", "After he visited he tried to come back to the house, he had a key, but my mum was home so we've taken his key and changed some of the locks. I'm also wearing the ring most of the time and as I'm on school holidays at the moments I'm hanging out at friends houses most of the time so I don't think he'll be able to get to me. I also don't think he's the type of person to try and hurt me for it and as his relationship has ended he has no use for the ring. Thank you for the advice though!!", "My father, his uncle, has put some space between us but as this is still very recent I'm not sure how this will play out", "She didn't brake up with because of the ring but what he was saying a bout me, she is a very close friend of mine and when she was at my house she said she wouldn't have accepted that ring from him. Another thing, he has an extremely good job for his age making about 150k per year so I believe he has more then enough money to buy her an amazing ring", "I don't know exactly what he told people as my parents haven't told me much but as far as I know he told them that he had caught the ring for me last year and he decided that he wanted it back to propose saying he would replace it. My dad's side of the family didn't know I had the ring at the time.", "I think she broke up w/ him for being an AH and asking for the ring in the first place, not b/c he was unsuccessful in getting it.", "I think the ex GF broke up with the cousin because of him asking for it in the first place and because he was bad mouthing OP. If anything, she helped the ex girlfriend to realize this guy isn\u2019t who she thought he was. Agree otherwise, though. He\u2019s too immature to get married. \n\nNTA, OP. You don\u2019t owe your cousin anything and especially not a ring purchased for you by your maternal grandmother, who he has no relation to. He\u2019s being absurd and childish.", "He probably just doesn't want to spend money on a ring when he could bully his much younger cousin into giving him one for free.", "What? I don't understand what you wrote.", "Huh??", "Do you mean he \u201cbought you the ring recently\u201d?", "What a lovely story. Enjoy your ring and all the history behind it.  Ignore your cousin.", "Then he\u2019s clearly poisonous.", "Kid. You are fourteen and he lied to people to harass you to get a ring. He started screaming when you didn't give him the ring.

Just because he is not together with his girlfriend does not mean he won't try to get it because you said no.", "Take pictures of the ring. Also ask if it's possible to get the ring appraised and insured.", "It's best you two don't see each other for a while. Also, hide this ring somewhere safe.", "Thats bizarre..... but your friend had a lucky escape", "Caught? Do you mean \"bought?\"", "So yeah, not much like reality.

Currently he is with his grandparents in him father's side. I don't know them. It's about 7 hours away from my house, he doesn't have a car but he does have more then enough money to get a bus or a car if he really wanted. Thank you for the advice you've given.", "He has gotten in some legal trouble before but he was a dumb teenage who wanted some excitement so I don't believe he has a lieing problem, but in the other hand we do have a large age gap and my family obviously doesn't tell everyone everything", "Wait what kind of jobs do M and H have where they're making 6 figures for their age?? That's a lot...and where can I find such jobs??", "I hope everything is okay. But please don't trust this cousin anymore. And if he shows up and you are alone, call your parents and don't let him in.", "NTA", "NTA and you saved your friend from marrying your punk of a cousin! I hope you both are life long friends\ud83d\udc9a", "I'm not completely sure what they do but I know h graduated early and did extremely well for herself, m only told how much he made when he was accused by my parents if not being able to afford a ring. He's after owns his own business but as his parents has her when they were in their Kate 50's he's given most of the company to her.", "I'm coming into this after the edits and you are definitely NTA! But I just want to say that both you and H seem to be grounded, caring, and supportive young women and H sounds like she'll be a positive influence on you moving forward. Wishing you both all the best!", "NTA\n\nThe edits make your cousin out to be an even worse AH.\n\nAlso, giving someone a compliment on their possessions doesn't necessarily mean the person wants it.", "NTA\n\nI have seen several of these types of posts where a relative simply demands something, and then turns the family against the victim when they refuse. This is always shocking and unacceptable.\n\nFrankly it reminds me of Sm\u00e9agol killing D\u00e9agol when he won't relinquish The Precious. How does one become so entitled as to sacrifice their own integrity and someone else's well-being over such a small thing?", "Good on her", "If it\u2019s finance or tech, it\u2019s very possible.", "Become the next 'Mr Beast' or be sexy enough for OnlyFans.
