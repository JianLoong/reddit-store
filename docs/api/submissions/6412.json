I also have friends with dogs that I get along with because after I get to know a dog, my fear dissipates. The interactions I've had with many dog owners has made me distrustful of owners I don't know. This guy was definitely an asshole, but because of his aggression, not because he didn't want a dog on his property. Maybe he's had to clean up someone else's dog shit one too many times? Thing is, too many dog owners literally do not care about non-dog people. Your post, saying anyone who doesn't like dogs is clearly untrustworthy is case in point.", "Hate to break it to you, but it's more about breed and individual physiology. My male dalmatian had very destructive pee, while with my female husky it took over a decade for her favorite pee spots to show any damage.", "This also happens with male dogs.", "My male Pekingnese left burn marks where he peed. OP is TA for having his dog pee in other people's yards.", "And? \n\nSomebody who doesnt have a dog and maintains a lawn for his own benefit has no duty to cater to your dog.  If you own a dog in an unconvenient neighborhood, thats your problem to solve and not to impose it on others.", "My curb is not public property.  It belongs to me.  The city has an easement on *my property* but thats for the city's usage and not for anyone else.  I pay taxes on that land.  I dont beleive in soiling up other people's yard with my dog's waste.  The fact I have a dog doesnt grant me the right to use their property as a dog ground, this is a position I would never feel entitled to adopt.  Moderately sized cities have parks and dog parks, areas designated for this purpose.", "It\u2019s about how they pee. Most females squat and release all at once. Most males lift leg go a little in as many different spots as they can do it\u2019s not concentrated.", "It\u2019s because when a female dog pees they\u2019ll squat down and release it all in one spot so it\u2019s very concentrated. When a male dog goes they spray in multiple spots on the walks so it\u2019s not concentrated.", "You sound like a fun person to have as a neighbor.", "Its your right to feel how you wish with your own property.  You're the one taking care of it, paying taxes on it and have to look at it.  Whatever suits you is fine with me.\n\nI ask that you reciprocate and let me do the same with mine.  I dont like dead patches on my lawn and as the property owner, Im entitled to feel that way.  The dog repellant has done a remarkable job, I apply it every few weeks and after rain."]}
