Shes very supportive and kind and she has shown that. Anyways,\n\nLast week, My SIL was coming to town for Christmas. My parents and my Fianc\u00e9's parents are very close, and I have known my SIL and fianc\u00e9 almost since childhood. When she came, my fiance basically planned a dinner with me, her and my SIL, in a very expensive restaurant, way out of my budget. I ultimately thought and one of them was going to pay, because my fiancee knows my financial situation. I was happy to see my SIL because she usually never visits town because shes studying computer science and usually stays at her university for most of the year. Anyways, we enter the restaurant and we booked a table for 3. My SIL and fianc\u00e9 ordered their meals, but my SIL ordered few of the most expensive meals on the menu. I obviously thought they were going to pay for it so I didn't think much of it, and I just got myself a $25 dollar steak. We ate the meals and were happy across the whole meal, talking about how my SIL's university is and everything about that topic. When the bill came, it totaled to around $300, way out of my budget, as I said. My fianc\u00e9 indicated for me to pay with my card, and I nodded my head no, and she started squinting her eyes, and she looked clearly frustrated. We also barely go to any restaurants and even if we do, we just split 5050, and then that's what I asked the waiter, before my fiance cut my words and said \"he will be paying full.\" and then my SIL said that \"(my name) pay for it this one time.\" After she said that, I stormed off the restaurant and drove off to our apartment. She blew my phone up with calls and texts, but I didn't respond to any of them. She came home 35 minutes later and started arguing with me about why I didn't pay and it was embarrassing for them, and it was childish about how you ran off.\n\n\nAITA? I know I was a jerk and it was childish of me storming off but expecting me to pay over $300 for a restaurant bill was too much for me.\n\nJust for any confusions: I left $25 and a $2 tip and before leaving, I said to the waiter serving us that they will pay, and then I left. \n\n\nAlso, tipping here doesn't have a percentage nor is it encouraged. this was not made in the US, i just made the money converted into US dollars. \n\n(This is also a decoy account because my fiance has reddit but she doesn't follow AITA)", "created_utc": 1702559845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18i8f3f/aita_for_storming_off_after_i_didnt_pay_for_my/", "score": 2295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ve noticed that people who haven\u2019t had money troubles or don\u2019t understand why someone might not want to go into debt for a frivolous reason with credit cards often think it\u2019s cheapness. As in yeah, she might know on the surface that you don\u2019t have much money, but her value system is different so to her, you should want to make the gesture of paying now and again even if the money has to be paid off or you sacrifice something else. I\u2019d get this sort of difference in values resolved before marriage - time for premarital counseling! Or else you will be one of those spouses who get surprised with a giant credit bill that their partner doesn\u2019t think is a big deal to have because \u201ceveryone\u201d has credit cards and they don\u2019t want to miss out on the next fun thing.", "$300 is no chump change.

Did you ask your fianc\u00e9 why she chose such an expensive restaurant? It sounds like a communication issue.

Walking out was not the most mature move but I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t let her financially fuck you especially after the SiL ordered one of the most expensive things.

It seems like the fiance wants to impress friends or family from out of town, and show what a \"good provider\" or \"successful man\" they are engaged to.  And they expect you to pick up the bill because \"you're the man.\" \n\nOr it may be a test of a different sort, to see if they CAN control you and finances in this way, going forward into the marriage.  You may have been childish to run off, but she was much more calculatingly childish to set you up like this.

That aside, if you normally pay for yourselves, *that* would still be the go-to. But throwing an entire bill onto one person with NO forethought or discussion?? If I was you I would be telling her that if she pulls that again you will be backing out of the relationship.\n\nYou do not need to be steamrolled or bullied, regardless of your parents being besties. No one needs to be tied to a selfish jerk that behaves that way, and who allows others (like her sister) to treat you that way.

WHY did they think you'd put it on your card? \n\nWhy was there no discussion about paying beforehand?\n\nSeems a lot of grown folks are scared or unwilling to speak up before a dinner and agree on how things will be paid afterwards. Part of adulting is being able to state what you can afford and what you're intending to pay. Is it awkward? Maybe, if your friends and family are weird about money, but it's absolutely necessary when you are personally strapped for cash! Better to have a tough convo before you eat rather than getting stuck with a big bill you cannot comfortably pay afterwards.\n\nIf we can't have this discussion with the people nearest and dearest to you, then we really need to check if these people truly care for us (and want what's best for us long term, and not just to stuff their face with free food), and what skills we need to build to be able to advocate for ourselves. \n\nSpeaking up beforehand and reaching an understanding BEFORE you order ensures that everyone goes onto order what they can cover, or they agree to share or whatever.", "NTA.

I absolutely hate going to group dinners unless it's with friends who we have established norms such as this, and for that reason I will always make a point to say upfront to the server that my spouse and I are on a separate check and make sure others hear it.

Not only did you motion NO that you weren\u2019t paying the whole bill, your fianc\u00e9 STILL tried putting you on the spot saying you would pay for it. And her sister\u2019s remark, was gross. Expectation and entitlement is gross. Everyone saying that y\u2019all should have had this conversation beforehand, why!? Yes it would have been helpful but why is it normalized that it\u2019s ok for people to expect?! I know I would never assume that someone was paying for the whole bill or my portion, especially if it was my idea to go out to eat at an expensive place.

I almost wonder if this was a setup to see how you would react? Clearly even your SIL knows you always pay 50/50, so for them to choose an expensive restaurant expecting you to pay raises some flags. I'm not saying you were being tested, but it sounds like a real possibility.\n\nYour response was way overkill and childish. You had an opportunity to discuss in advance who would pay for dinner with your fiance just to be super clear, but you didn't. The other two, however, put you on the spot and tried to pressure you into paying for a very expensive meal when you hadn't budgeted for that, and thats not right either. I think everyone's the asshole here.", "I have the feeling this was your fianc\u00e9e's attempt to show off or improve her family's impression of you, which you totally fucked over.\n\nIt's also going to be an uphill battle to get your fianc\u00e9e's family to like you after this, because her sister is going to tell EVERYONE that you pitched a fit, stormed out of a restaurant, and drove away, abandoning her sister. They will care fare more about that than you not being able to pay. They will think you're abusive or something for that level of reaction.\n\nI suspect that either: 1) Your fianc\u00e9e wanted to make a show of this nice dinner and you paying to leave a good impression, and would have paid you back privately afterwards, or 2) she has gotten sick of the budgeting, treating you, and the 50/50, and decided to force you to treat her for once. Or both. Like, she wanted to see if you'd do it, and if you did, then she'd have paid you back.\n\nHopefully, you don't stay engaged much longer: you don't seem like a good fit. Your communication is garbage, and neither cares how the other feels. She doesn't care about/ understand your money stress, and you don't care about her reputation with her family.\n\nI'm going ESH. Your fianc\u00e9e should have cleared the matter of payment beforehand....but you should have, too (don't think I didn't notice that you assumed they'd be treating you, without you double checking if that was the case. That's just as bad as your fianc\u00e9e assuming you'd be fine paying). And storming out was very childish; you need better control of yourself.", "Does no one on Earth talk to each other?\n\nESH\n\nYou were childish storming off.\n\nYou fiance was thoughtless in assuming you were paying.\n\nYour SIL took advantage of the situation.\n\nPay the bill and later have a conversation with your FUTURE SPOUSE regarding communication and finances.", "ESH.  Everyone assumed everyone else was paying.  This should have been discussed beforehand.", "NTA\n\nWhy are you so scared of your fiancee?? What a terrible existence. Decoy account lol.", "ESH, close to NTA. Next time discuss how the bill will be paid before going there, instead of making assumptions on your own, especially since you were involved in planning the dinner. This entire situation could have been prevented with some proper communication, instead of making assumptions and having those blow up in your faces.\n\nSince your fiance knows your financial situation and that the restaurant is way out of budget for you then her trying to force the bill on you without discussing that in advance is an asshole move. Her getting embarrassed is also mostly her own fault, she too should have discussed who would pay the bill in advance.\n\nSo I finally went with ESH, but it's also very close to NTA, because the both of you need to work on how you communicate in your relationship.

Neither of you would be in this position if you would just TALK to each other.

We also barely go to any restaurants and even if we do, we just split 5050. \n\nWhy? Why is it always a split bill? I mean, going out to dinner is a date. You really shouldn't be double dutching (term for when you split the bill). At the very least, you both should take turns paying the tabs at restaurants. Just my personal opinion. Otherwise, you can't really call it a date. \n\n2. my fianc\u00e9 cut my words and said \"he will be paying full.\" and then my SIL said that \"(my name) pay for it this one time.\"\n\nI feel like this speaks to something deeper going on here. Do you and your fianc\u00e9 ever have dates where you pay for dinner? Or is it always 50/50 and/or She Pays? I'm thinking that perhaps your fianc\u00e9 is struggling with the feeling like a friend, and not your girlfriend, when you guys go out to dinner. I'm not saying a boyfriend has to pay all of the time for dates. But you ought to at least make an effort once in a while to make your girl feel like she's more special to you than the normal friends you have in your life. That's just common sense. Paying for a dinner out once is easy to do if you budget for it.\n\n3.  I obviously thought they were going to pay for it. ;  My fianc\u00e9 indicated for me to pay with my card.\n\nCan you really get mad at your fianc\u00e9 and SIL when they literally made the same assumption you did about dinner?

Being mad about this is having a double standard, and makes you hypocritical.\n\nI say ESH because there is clearly a major of lack of communication within your relationship with your fianc\u00e9. You said you were part of the dinner plan conversation. Why didn't you speak up about the restaurant if it was out of your price range? And why did none of you discuss the business of who was going to pay for said dinner during this planning time? Again, assumptions made assholes out of everyone involved because of poor communication skills. \n\nAs for how you handled things? You should have stood your ground. Your fianc\u00e9 isn't your momma. When she interrupted and said, \"he will be paying in full\", you should have said to her \"Excuse me, but we ARE splitting the bill, and if you're mad, I'm sorry. But we can discuss it when we get home. But I am not paying for all of us, and that is final.\"  Might have been a little uncomfortable and awkward, but it would likely have avoided a scene and any embarrassment.\n\nIf I may, it sounds like you and your fianc\u00e9 might need to have some in depth conversations in the future about finances, communication, and what expectations you each have for this relationship.
