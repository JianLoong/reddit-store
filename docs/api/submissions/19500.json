She\u2019s not being reasonable. If she insists, simply drop out, as is your right to do!", "NTA Your friend is absolutely in the wrong", "NTA.\n\nMy late friend had T1D. When she was first diagnosed, she was quite self-conscious about doing the things she needed to (pricking her finger, injecting with insulin, etc.) in public. She was worried people would stare at her. She felt she needed to go off and find a bathroom to do it in private, and of course that wasn't always going to be possible, or the bathroom might not be clean enough.\n\nIt was a diabetes educator at the hospital who finally convinced her: *do not hide*. Diabetes management is a routine fact of life for someone with T1D. You don't need to make a big song and dance about it and wave your needles and lancets under people's noses and shout \"Look what I'm doing!\", but *nor do you need to hide it*. It's nothing to be ashamed of. If people are uncomfortable, that's their problem. They can just look away.\n\nSo from that point onward, she began managing her diabetes while sitting at the lunch table with us. And honestly, most of the time, I barely even noticed. I only ever remembered she had T1D when she'd start to act a little oddly, e.g. not making sense, or getting upset over nothing. Then I'd say \"Have you checked your BGL?\", and she'd check it, and it would be a bit low, so we'd get some sugar into her.\n\nYour friend is being an AH. Your sensor is essential medical equipment, and it's no big deal. It won't spoil her fucking wedding photos. Honestly, this is on a par with not wanting someone in a wheelchair to take part in the photos. It's ableist and cruel and stupid. In your case, it's also dangerous. Being forced to wear a jacket or sweater on a hot day is a stupid idea which could endanger your health.\n\nTell your friend you will not be covering up your sensor, and if she doesn't like it, she can get someone else to be her MoH.\n\nI'm betting she'll get the photographer to photoshop it out, which is still ableist, etc. but at least it won't involve you spending the day in a position of discomfort and risk.", "NTA at all. \n\nThis is a situation that you can\u2019t control.
