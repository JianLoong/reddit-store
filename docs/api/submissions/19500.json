I was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and wear a small sensor on my arm to monitor my blood sugar (Dexcom G7). We were talking about the wedding one day and she brought up me wearing a small jacket or cardigan to cover the sensor, not wanting to see it in the pictures. It surprised me because if I stand at a certain angle you can\u2019t even see it. Since the wedding is during the summer and she wants it outside, I know it\u2019s going to be really hot and heat can already effect my blood sugar so I don\u2019t want too, but she\u2019s adamant that I wear one.\nSo AITA for refusing to wear a sweater at my friends wedding?\n\nETA: I just wanted to add because I see it a lot in the comments asking if I\u2019m able to put it anywhere else. The only other places I\u2019m allowed to put it are my hip, thigh, and butt; and with my work uniform it would be very uncomfortable to put it in any of those places since I would have to deal with it for 10 days. I am looking into patches that would blend in with my skin to cover it and I\u2019ll bring it up to her, like I said I was just diagnosed so I didn\u2019t even know they made those. \n\nAlso, my friend and her finance don\u2019t have a lot of money due to family issues, so I know they\u2019re not going to higher some fancy photographer for the pictures. It\u2019s a somewhat casual, but still fancy wedding (I bought my maid of honor dress at a thrift store and she loved it if that makes any sense)\n\nAnd I\u2019m not ashamed of this, if people see or ask about it, I\u2019m willing to talk about it to help them understand more.

She\u2019s not being reasonable. If she insists, simply drop out, as is your right to do!", "NTA Your friend is absolutely in the wrong", "NTA.\n\nMy late friend had T1D. When she was first diagnosed, she was quite self-conscious about doing the things she needed to (pricking her finger, injecting with insulin, etc.) in public. She was worried people would stare at her. She felt she needed to go off and find a bathroom to do it in private, and of course that wasn't always going to be possible, or the bathroom might not be clean enough.\n\nIt was a diabetes educator at the hospital who finally convinced her: *do not hide*. Diabetes management is a routine fact of life for someone with T1D. You don't need to make a big song and dance about it and wave your needles and lancets under people's noses and shout \"Look what I'm doing!\", but *nor do you need to hide it*. It's nothing to be ashamed of. If people are uncomfortable, that's their problem. They can just look away.\n\nSo from that point onward, she began managing her diabetes while sitting at the lunch table with us. And honestly, most of the time, I barely even noticed. I only ever remembered she had T1D when she'd start to act a little oddly, e.g. not making sense, or getting upset over nothing. Then I'd say \"Have you checked your BGL?\", and she'd check it, and it would be a bit low, so we'd get some sugar into her.\n\nYour friend is being an AH. Your sensor is essential medical equipment, and it's no big deal. It won't spoil her fucking wedding photos. Honestly, this is on a par with not wanting someone in a wheelchair to take part in the photos. It's ableist and cruel and stupid. In your case, it's also dangerous. Being forced to wear a jacket or sweater on a hot day is a stupid idea which could endanger your health.\n\nTell your friend you will not be covering up your sensor, and if she doesn't like it, she can get someone else to be her MoH.\n\nI'm betting she'll get the photographer to photoshop it out, which is still ableist, etc. but at least it won't involve you spending the day in a position of discomfort and risk.", "NTA at all. \n\nThis is a situation that you can\u2019t control.

Your CGM should be celebrated not hidden\u2026 besides a sweater would be more out of context than a little box on your arm.", "NTA but what Cgm are you using?", "NTA. Your friend is being extremely inconsiderate to your needs. You have a literal medical condition and she\u2019s worried about it disrupting the aesthetic of her wedding? There are a million other far more important things for her to be worried about on her wedding day lol. I think it\u2019s absurd to put your health at a greater risk for such a superficial reason. IF you\u2019re able to put the sensor on your hip or thigh it may be worth the discomfort just to get your friend off your back about it, but I honestly don\u2019t think you should have to. \n\nNow, I have done some wedding photography and have a few comments from that perspective. Firstly, any photographer who is mindful of posing can direct their subjects to hide things like this, if needed. Wedding photographers constantly have to ask people to take phones/wallets out of their pockets (you can usually see the outline), sunglasses off heads, etc lol. It\u2019s just part of the job. You mentioned that if you stand at a certain angle you can\u2019t see it. All your friend needs to do is make the photographer aware of this and ask them to pose you in such a way that it can\u2019t be seen (if you\u2019re okay with that, of course).\n\nSecondly, this seems like it would be super easy to edit out of photos. I looked up the sensor you mentioned to see what it looks like/the size and it seems to be roughly the size of a quarter, maybe a little larger? In most cases, this would be a very quick and easy edit. However, some photographers absolutely will not do extra editing (even something as seemingly minor as this) and it\u2019s never cool to assume the photographer can/will do extra editing, so it\u2019s something she will have to bring up to the photographer, preferably before hiring them, to make sure they\u2019re on board. But if she ends up with a photographer who won\u2019t edit it out, she could easily find a photo editor who will do it, and since this is such a simple thing to remove (and it\u2019s unlikely it will be visible in ALL the photos) it probably wouldn\u2019t cost much. If she doesn\u2019t want to pay, she could even get a free trial of Photoshop (or any photo editing app with a blemish removal/spot healing tool) and do it herself if it really means that much to her. \n\nBottom line: YOUR HEALTH COMES FIRST. I understand wanting your wedding photos to be perfect, but compromising someone\u2019s health for such a thing is ludicrous to me. I guess the bright side is you guys have adequate time to figure something out that works for both of you, and maybe in that time she\u2019ll come around and realize that she\u2019s being unreasonable. I hope you guys can come to an agreement and please stay safe!!!", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nIt can just be photoshopped out later if it's that big of a deal. But really it's not.

I am 51 and haven't been to a young person's wedding in a while.", "Yeah, my mom and mother-in-law were both somehow confused when my response to what to wear was suggesting something they liked that would be fun for dancing, that was in 2014.", "Honestly yes, though I\u2019ve noticed MOB/G dresses take a more \u201cbridesmaid but make it matronly\u201d look to them, than usual wedding guest dresses.", "One of my friends ran into a similar problem.  They sewed a simple slip cover for the back of her chair to match her dress.  It looked super cute.  \n\nShe didn\u2019t need to cover it, but sometimes even her noble steed likes to be fancy.", "I dislike the number of wedding related posts here. Mostly SO repetitive.\n\nBut your story made my morning.", "NOT THE MAMA!", "OP already stated it would be uncomfortable with her work clothes if she wore it in an alternative position. OP should not have to suffer discomfort while working for 10 days for an even that will last a few hours. That\u2019s not fair and it\u2019s definitely not right. \n\nNTA, op. Stand your ground and offer to wear a sensor cover but then it\u2019ll look like a giant bandage and more people will ask about that than the tiny beige or white sensor on your arm.", "You\u2019d think someone so obsessed with the photoshoot would select a photographer skilled enough to edit out a tiny medical device.", "This. But assuming there are bridesmaids in addition to OP as MoH, make sure the sheer shawls are provided for bridesmaids too. After all, we wouldn't want OP to look different to the rest of the wedding party in the photos would we?", "Honestly, my (now estranged) mother used to want me to \u201close the crutches\u201d for photos, and she would never take a photo of me in my wheelchair.  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude44\n\nOP u/Anotherweddingask you are absolutely NTA.  I would just say \u201cYou either want me as MOH or you don\u2019t.  My sensor and I are a package deal.\u201d  WTF is wrong with her?  You\u2019ll draw more attention by boiling to death and collapsing than you will just wearing your sensor where it\u2019s comfortable.", "Yep, in the UK it\u2019s more common for the bride and groom to pay for the bridesmaid dresses. Not sure about the groomsmen\u2019s suits, but those can be rented for cheap. I\u2019ve lived mostly in the US, but my parents aren\u2019t from the US (or the UK). If you have a wedding you pay for everything.", "Yeah... I don't see an issue with it.  My parents and in-laws didn't match my wedding colors per-say, but they went with the general vibe of the wedding.  We had a summer garden party type of venue.  Our colors were shades of pink and purple with dark green.  I told out parents the colors and let them pick outfits that fit.  My mom wore a champagne colored dress that she picked and my dad wore a light grey suit with a light pink tie that complimented my moms dress.  My MIL wore a royal blue dress and my FIL wore a light grey suit with a royal blue tie.  They looked especially well coordinated with their sons in the pictures.\n\nWhen you are going to take lots of pictures it is nice to have people coordinate, and you can do it while letting people pick the style and colors they feel nicest in. I had my bridesmaids pick their own dresses from the company I picked, I just gave guidelines.  I picked a color that everyone would feel nice in.\n\nI think everyone appreciates how lovely and cohesive they look in pictures.\n\nBut to be clear... OP is NTA.  Her medical device will not detract from pictures.   The bride in this case is the AH.", "A wild GRANDMA\u2640\ufe0fhas appeared! \n\nGRANDMA uses TACKLE!", "Ya we don\u2019t do that. We would pay for everything and host you. And then as a bridesmaid you\u2019d probably give a larger monetary gift to \u201ccover the cost of the dress\u201d. But that would be way less than paying for everything else in a North American wedding. \n\nBut I find Canadian culture different in that it\u2019s very host-focused and not guest-focused. Lack of food, cash bars, etc. Not trying to be judgemental, it\u2019s just different."]}
