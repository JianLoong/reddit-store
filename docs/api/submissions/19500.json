I was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and wear a small sensor on my arm to monitor my blood sugar (Dexcom G7). We were talking about the wedding one day and she brought up me wearing a small jacket or cardigan to cover the sensor, not wanting to see it in the pictures. It surprised me because if I stand at a certain angle you can\u2019t even see it. Since the wedding is during the summer and she wants it outside, I know it\u2019s going to be really hot and heat can already effect my blood sugar so I don\u2019t want too, but she\u2019s adamant that I wear one.\nSo AITA for refusing to wear a sweater at my friends wedding?\n\nETA: I just wanted to add because I see it a lot in the comments asking if I\u2019m able to put it anywhere else. The only other places I\u2019m allowed to put it are my hip, thigh, and butt; and with my work uniform it would be very uncomfortable to put it in any of those places since I would have to deal with it for 10 days. I am looking into patches that would blend in with my skin to cover it and I\u2019ll bring it up to her, like I said I was just diagnosed so I didn\u2019t even know they made those. \n\nAlso, my friend and her finance don\u2019t have a lot of money due to family issues, so I know they\u2019re not going to higher some fancy photographer for the pictures. It\u2019s a somewhat casual, but still fancy wedding (I bought my maid of honor dress at a thrift store and she loved it if that makes any sense)\n\nAnd I\u2019m not ashamed of this, if people see or ask about it, I\u2019m willing to talk about it to help them understand more.

She\u2019s not being reasonable. If she insists, simply drop out, as is your right to do!", "NTA Your friend is absolutely in the wrong", "NTA.\n\nMy late friend had T1D. When she was first diagnosed, she was quite self-conscious about doing the things she needed to (pricking her finger, injecting with insulin, etc.) in public. She was worried people would stare at her. She felt she needed to go off and find a bathroom to do it in private, and of course that wasn't always going to be possible, or the bathroom might not be clean enough.\n\nIt was a diabetes educator at the hospital who finally convinced her: *do not hide*. Diabetes management is a routine fact of life for someone with T1D. You don't need to make a big song and dance about it and wave your needles and lancets under people's noses and shout \"Look what I'm doing!\", but *nor do you need to hide it*. It's nothing to be ashamed of. If people are uncomfortable, that's their problem. They can just look away.\n\nSo from that point onward, she began managing her diabetes while sitting at the lunch table with us. And honestly, most of the time, I barely even noticed. I only ever remembered she had T1D when she'd start to act a little oddly, e.g. not making sense, or getting upset over nothing. Then I'd say \"Have you checked your BGL?\", and she'd check it, and it would be a bit low, so we'd get some sugar into her.\n\nYour friend is being an AH. Your sensor is essential medical equipment, and it's no big deal. It won't spoil her fucking wedding photos. Honestly, this is on a par with not wanting someone in a wheelchair to take part in the photos. It's ableist and cruel and stupid. In your case, it's also dangerous. Being forced to wear a jacket or sweater on a hot day is a stupid idea which could endanger your health.\n\nTell your friend you will not be covering up your sensor, and if she doesn't like it, she can get someone else to be her MoH.\n\nI'm betting she'll get the photographer to photoshop it out, which is still ableist, etc. but at least it won't involve you spending the day in a position of discomfort and risk.", "NTA at all. \n\nThis is a situation that you can\u2019t control.
