She\u2019s not being reasonable. If she insists, simply drop out, as is your right to do!", "NTA Your friend is absolutely in the wrong", "NTA.\n\nMy late friend had T1D. When she was first diagnosed, she was quite self-conscious about doing the things she needed to (pricking her finger, injecting with insulin, etc.) in public. She was worried people would stare at her. She felt she needed to go off and find a bathroom to do it in private, and of course that wasn't always going to be possible, or the bathroom might not be clean enough.\n\nIt was a diabetes educator at the hospital who finally convinced her: *do not hide*. Diabetes management is a routine fact of life for someone with T1D. You don't need to make a big song and dance about it and wave your needles and lancets under people's noses and shout \"Look what I'm doing!\", but *nor do you need to hide it*. It's nothing to be ashamed of. If people are uncomfortable, that's their problem. They can just look away.\n\nSo from that point onward, she began managing her diabetes while sitting at the lunch table with us. And honestly, most of the time, I barely even noticed. I only ever remembered she had T1D when she'd start to act a little oddly, e.g. not making sense, or getting upset over nothing. Then I'd say \"Have you checked your BGL?\", and she'd check it, and it would be a bit low, so we'd get some sugar into her.\n\nYour friend is being an AH. Your sensor is essential medical equipment, and it's no big deal. It won't spoil her fucking wedding photos. Honestly, this is on a par with not wanting someone in a wheelchair to take part in the photos. It's ableist and cruel and stupid. In your case, it's also dangerous. Being forced to wear a jacket or sweater on a hot day is a stupid idea which could endanger your health.\n\nTell your friend you will not be covering up your sensor, and if she doesn't like it, she can get someone else to be her MoH.\n\nI'm betting she'll get the photographer to photoshop it out, which is still ableist, etc. but at least it won't involve you spending the day in a position of discomfort and risk.", "NTA at all. \n\nThis is a situation that you can\u2019t control.

That sensor is now part of your body, it's like asking someone who has too big boobs to get a reduction so she could fit in her bridesmaids dress..... I've also heard of people asking their bridesmaids to lose a few pounds so they don't stand out too much in the pictures, and for people who have the audacity to ask bs like this, I ask you: \n\nHow self centered do you have to be to hear yourself making these requests and not think it's unfair or unreasonable? Let people be, stop focusing on some obsessive redundant details and have fun at your wedding/party. Literally nobody cares about people's medical devices, no one thinks they're an incumbent on good party vibes.... Maybe one or two people will ask about it, not having seen one before, but how insecure do you have to be to think a curious question directed at someone who's not the bride or groom will take away from your thunder.", "If she can\u2019t accept that, maybe you should reconsider friendship.", "[removed]", "Think about how she would react if you had a leg brace or something.", "Just tell her not to use it.

From my understanding, she was going to be transitioning to a walking cast in a time frame where she wasn't sure she'd be out of it in time for the wedding, at all.
