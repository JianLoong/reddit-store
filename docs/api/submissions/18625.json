What this means is she's dressing up her extreme insecurity and need for total control in what she thinks are the accoutrements of respectability. If you tell her this is crazy, unhealthy, etc., she can turn around and call you a monster for being so uncaring. Same could potentially be said of any non-insane pet owner, as far as she's concerned.\n\nObviously you need to leave. She has serious emotional problems that go way past the ordinary stuff that makes life difficult for the rest of us, and I really doubt you can help her work past them. For that matter, I *am* sure that you shouldn't try. Even if you succeed, this is not the kind of thing most people consider the foundation of a marriage.\n\nOne last thing: She has done you one very big favor by showing you what her approach to parenting is going to be.

It's so odd that he got to know her well enough to propose but didn't know she has anxiety over her pet or hasnt' done anything to address it.", "YTA love me love my dog or get out.  She should seriously reconsider being with you, you sound resentful, I wouldn\u2019t trust you with a dog.", "NTA in this case but could there be a bigger issue? Did your fianc\u00e9e go through any trauma when she first got the dog, that would make her extra clingy to him?\n\nI myself went through a horrible break-up (mental abuse, not physical) when I got my furbaby and I clung to him much like your fianc\u00e9e is doing, to the point where he got separation anxiety.\n\nYes I've worked with him, over the last 6 years, my current partner helped a lot with that, he explained I was treating my poor baby as an emotional trauma helper and wasn't letting him be a proper dog.\n\nAlso you mentioned you had a bad experience with dogs as a kid, so could you be afraid or even jealous of the dog in some way?\n\nI personally think you need to sit down and have a serious chat with your fianc\u00e9e and get to the bottom of her attachment, I'm glad my partner did as we are going 6 years strong and, him and my baby are inseparable, he prefers his dad's pats to mine \ud83d\ude02.\n\nHope this experience can help you guys moving forward, best of luck.", "For the first half, it did seem like you were about to be the AH but after reading it all nah", "Going against the gain. Slightly ESH. \n\nYou knew who she was about her dog. This can't be a new thing that just started bothering you. So, why are you surprised and just walk out like that? I mean, you're the least Ah, but still...\n\nI love my dogs, and if someone didn't message when they said they would, then I would be concerned, but 2 hours is a bit too much for me, too. If that's her thing, though, then I wouldn't care IF I expect it. So, I get the frustration. Again, though, you knew she was like that, so why did you expect something different...?", "RUN!", "NTA. I get it dogs are like family but what an unhealthy relationship with your dog. That is ridiculous", "Run for the hills bro and don\u2019t look back - NTA", "NTA\n\nOP, this is an incredibly clear red flag waving in your face and you need to pay attention and end it with her.\n\nShe is clearly in the wrong. She loves that dog more than you and she always will. If you have gotten engaged with her then I am certain you have ignored many red flags before now.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, just realize that marrying her is NOT going to solve any problems. It\u2019ll only make them much much worse and you and her will almost certainly separate anyways and you will be much worse off for it.\n\nDo yourself a favor and break it off now. Find a woman who is going to care more about you than she cares about her dog on your engagement celebration dinner.", "NTA. Usually it\u2019s the dog that has the separation anxiety. Here, it seems to be your girlfriend. I would reconsider the engagement until you guys can figure something out here so that getting married to her won\u2019t mean planning your life around her dog. If she is able to work out a way to live a bit less closely attached to her dog or something it\u2019s not worth throwing the whole relationship away over. I\u2019m also incredibly attached to my dog, I am very bonded to him and he has been with me through some of my worst times, so I understand it can be difficult to entrust another person with his care but that\u2019s just something you have to do as a dog owner sometimes.", "This is probably the only comment that made sense", "Yeah but that's only because she can keep her eye on the actual dog that way rather than getting distracted by looking at OP", "Always smells like peanut butter.", "He knows she's like that though because he writes he has reservations about her turning down jobs, how she texts him asking about the dog only during the daya he works  from home and he also discusses his bad experience as a child with dogs. So he knows. He still asked her marry him and did a trip then pouted when she was herself.  Kind of silly actually especially if the dog was there first.", "\"Fido on his back, all four legs in the air\"", "I have a fiance. Our dogs are our children. We don't have human kids by choice.", "Dog will be the ring bearer at their wedding!", "Same. I'm married with dogs and a cat.  I've never wanted kids, and will never have any"]}
