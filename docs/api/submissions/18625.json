I work from home 3 days a week and she only texts asking how the dog is. \n\nI planned this very nice trip last weekend to celebrate our engagement. I booked a nice hotel and made reservations at a nice restaurant. One of our close friends stayed with the dog. My fiance asked her to text with an update every two hours.

When we arrived at the restaurant, we had to wait 30 minutes for a table to open. When we sat down, my fiance spent the entire dinner on her phone trying to get ahold of the friend. I paid for the meal and got up from the table telling her that I was going to wait in the car. She came out 20 minutes later screaming at me for leaving her at the table alone. \n\nI yelled back that she ruined our engagement trip for putting the dog over us.

He had every right to expect his fiancee to put the phone down.", "Asking for updates on her dog every 2 hours is OTT, come on! Yes she was concerned but her fianc\u00e9 made all this effort FOR HER and she could only think about the dog. She could have tried to enjoy her dinner and then reach out to her friend. There\u2019s many innocent, innocuous reasons for why her friend didn\u2019t update every 2 hours (phone on mute, battery drained, she forgot / got distracted, etc.).

Replace \"the dog\" with \"her child\" in the story and no one would argue she was wrong for being worried about not getting updates as she asked for and for trying to reach the sitter. The fact that it is \"just a dog\" simply reinforces everything I said about his lacking of caring for her feelings.", "I agree that every 2 hours is excessive but that's what she wanted and he was aware of all this before hand. It's not like it was a secret. \n\nI also agree that at best their relationship is liable to be a very bumpy one since they are pretty far apart on their feelings here.", "Fair enough and agree", "Why do his feelings not matter?\n\nI am a dedicated dog owner. You can't replace \"the dog\" with \"her child\". These aren't comparable.\n\nHer dog was being cared for. Not being present in the moment was a bullshit move. Period.\n\nIn a balanced relationship between well-adjusted people, both parties' feelings and expectations carry equal weight. \n\nExpecting a romantic partner to get ready on time and to put their phone down at the dinner table isn't asking too much.", "You are right, his feelings do matter - so I *guess* you could convince me to side with ESH"]}
