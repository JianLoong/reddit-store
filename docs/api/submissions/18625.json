What this means is she's dressing up her extreme insecurity and need for total control in what she thinks are the accoutrements of respectability. If you tell her this is crazy, unhealthy, etc., she can turn around and call you a monster for being so uncaring. Same could potentially be said of any non-insane pet owner, as far as she's concerned.\n\nObviously you need to leave. She has serious emotional problems that go way past the ordinary stuff that makes life difficult for the rest of us, and I really doubt you can help her work past them. For that matter, I *am* sure that you shouldn't try. Even if you succeed, this is not the kind of thing most people consider the foundation of a marriage.\n\nOne last thing: She has done you one very big favor by showing you what her approach to parenting is going to be.
