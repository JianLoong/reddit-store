They go to the same school as my kid, 6F and I work flexibly and from home so it was easy to pick the kids up and watch them for a few hours.\n\nI was always paid for my time as was my husband who helped but i quit after Claire accused my kid of stealing. She said with no evidence or anything that since her daughter\u2019s favourite doll was missing, it was obvious my daughter had stolen it since it was last at my house. I asked my daughter, she said no and I believed her. She said she saw my niece leave with it and I believed her. I even searched my whole damn house and couldn\u2019t find it. I told my sister all this and she said that my daughter is a liar and a thief and that I\u2019m enabling her and she expects me to pay for a new doll. I was so angry and incensed that she was being so nasty and horrible that I just said to her \u2018my daughter is no liar and thief and you know what? I\u2019m done. Find someone else to babysit cos it certainly won\u2019t be me and hung up.\u2019\n\nI got 5 missed calls from Claire before I blocked her. She sent panicked messages and tried calling my husband and he blocked her too. We have learnt from my parents that Claire is panicking because she really needs help with the kids and I\u2019m the only one with a sort of flexible routine to do so. She also said that she had found her daughter\u2019s doll, and said that thighs are okay now but not once has she offered any sort of apology for what she said about my kid.\n\nMy parents think I am screwing her over by not helping and that she made an honest mistake and is just stressed and everything due to her marriage split. They have said that perhaps I should take the higher ground and move on from this and don\u2019t seem to understand that my kid was accused of something she didn\u2019t do. I see it as I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s shitty to me, but definitely if it\u2019s about my kid and she hasn\u2019t once said sorry for accusing my six year old daughter of being a thief. She disrespected my kid and no amount of bad situation or stress is preventing her from saying sorry and smoothing things over.\n\nETA: I should have added, my niece never said my daughter stole her doll. She just said something along the lines of \u2018mummy I can\u2019t find my doll\u2019 and never said any other context to that. So my sister just assumed it meant my daughter stole it rather than believing it could have just been somewhere in her house.\n\nI quit babysitting because she was rude, nasty and bitter and is expecting things to go back to normal just cos she found the doll. She isn\u2019t admitting she messed up and I would be happy to babysit again but ONLY if she sincerely apologised, but she isn\u2019t so here we are.", "created_utc": 1693383145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1658kv0/aita_for_screwing_over_my_sister_by_immediately/", "score": 285, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think I misunderstood what my daughter was telling me when it went missing, I\u2019m so sorry I made those accusations.  The stress lately may be getting to me a bit, I really behaved badly.\u201d  But to do that, she\u2019d have to act reasonably and take responsibility, and I\u2019m noticing a bit of a theme here, aren\u2019t you?\n\nIt is her own fault that she is now lacking a babysitter.

She hasn\u2019t apologised and my daughter deserves one.", "Want forgiveness? Then take ownership of what you did instead of trying to sweep it under the rug. When you bite the hand that feeds you its on you to make amends. Not the person you bit.", "Her daughter (sister\u2019s daughter) told her that she lost her doll/can\u2019t find it not that her cousin (ops daughter) took her.\n\nShe threw delusional accusations to a person and a little girl who is helping her which in my opinion is unacceptable.", "Forgive someone who refuses to apologize? That's not forgiveness, that's just letting yourself be bullied.", "How was she escalating it? She accused OP\u2019s daughter of being a thief, didn\u2019t apologise after and just assumed everything\u2019s ok. Sounds to me there was a conversation and the sister accused OP of enabling her daughter.", "Kids leave shit all over. You'd expect shevwould know that having 2 of them.", "I'd explain this to your parents \"she was incredible disrespectful and mean to my daughter, she has yet to apologise or make amends for her appalling behaviour, and until she does such, I will not reward her for making baseless false accusations and hurting my daughter, by helping her\" then as you said elsewhere if she apologises sincerely and makes am ends then help her again, but she needs to learn not to treat people that way.", "It doesn't seem like the daughter even knows what happened. No reason to bring her into the nonsense unnecessarily.", "I SAID she should demand an apology.", "This. She is apparently desperate and panicking, but not enough to say \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019.", "To accuse a child aka her niece, is showing what she thinks about her.\n\n\"Normal\" peolpe would ask you, to look if the toy is somewhere, without calling thief and liar.\n\n\nBeing the bigger person it's always on the side of the offended/innocent one's....never for AH", "> I was so angry and incensed that she was being so nasty and horrible that I just said to her \u2018my daughter is no liar and thief and you know what? I\u2019m done. Find someone else to babysit cos it certainly won\u2019t be me and hung up.\u2019\n\nOP reacted out of anger and basically cut her sister off and then refused to answer her calls. \n\nBoth parties need to grow up"]}
