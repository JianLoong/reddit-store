They go to the same school as my kid, 6F and I work flexibly and from home so it was easy to pick the kids up and watch them for a few hours.\n\nI was always paid for my time as was my husband who helped but i quit after Claire accused my kid of stealing. She said with no evidence or anything that since her daughter\u2019s favourite doll was missing, it was obvious my daughter had stolen it since it was last at my house. I asked my daughter, she said no and I believed her. She said she saw my niece leave with it and I believed her. I even searched my whole damn house and couldn\u2019t find it. I told my sister all this and she said that my daughter is a liar and a thief and that I\u2019m enabling her and she expects me to pay for a new doll. I was so angry and incensed that she was being so nasty and horrible that I just said to her \u2018my daughter is no liar and thief and you know what? I\u2019m done. Find someone else to babysit cos it certainly won\u2019t be me and hung up.\u2019\n\nI got 5 missed calls from Claire before I blocked her. She sent panicked messages and tried calling my husband and he blocked her too. We have learnt from my parents that Claire is panicking because she really needs help with the kids and I\u2019m the only one with a sort of flexible routine to do so. She also said that she had found her daughter\u2019s doll, and said that thighs are okay now but not once has she offered any sort of apology for what she said about my kid.\n\nMy parents think I am screwing her over by not helping and that she made an honest mistake and is just stressed and everything due to her marriage split. They have said that perhaps I should take the higher ground and move on from this and don\u2019t seem to understand that my kid was accused of something she didn\u2019t do. I see it as I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s shitty to me, but definitely if it\u2019s about my kid and she hasn\u2019t once said sorry for accusing my six year old daughter of being a thief. She disrespected my kid and no amount of bad situation or stress is preventing her from saying sorry and smoothing things over.\n\nETA: I should have added, my niece never said my daughter stole her doll. She just said something along the lines of \u2018mummy I can\u2019t find my doll\u2019 and never said any other context to that. So my sister just assumed it meant my daughter stole it rather than believing it could have just been somewhere in her house.\n\nI quit babysitting because she was rude, nasty and bitter and is expecting things to go back to normal just cos she found the doll. She isn\u2019t admitting she messed up and I would be happy to babysit again but ONLY if she sincerely apologised, but she isn\u2019t so here we are.", "created_utc": 1693383145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1658kv0/aita_for_screwing_over_my_sister_by_immediately/", "score": 8920, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Id also worry that she may blame them for things her kid did as most kids don\u2019t own up to playing with stuff they shouldn\u2019t or drawing on a wall. President has been set on what she thinks of your child and that she seems to automatically blame them even if she doesn\u2019t say it out loud. \n\nAny mother is used to their children misplacing stuff and always default to searching your own home first and asking your child where they left it.  Yet she jumped to this without any reason and without even looking and that\u2019s the most concerning part of this as it shows her true feelings. Shes a mother she knows this is common place. It\u2019s also her blaming you as a thief to as surely you\u2019d know if your daughter took a doll that wasn\u2019t hers home. You\u2019d see it as you get them ready to leave.

How awful would that feel if she accused either of your children to their faces and tried to tell them off. Nothings is worse for a child than being blamed and punished when you\u2019re innocent. It would be different if her daughter had said they seen your daughter with it and that she had searched the house first. The fact she just jumped to that is what\u2019s making this more concerning to me.   \nIt is clear she still feels justified since she is refusing to apologise even though she knows she needs you. \n\nHaving a crappy sister myself I know my Sister would then go about hiding things and blame my kids just to prove she was right and pretend to find them in their coat pockets.

That is BULL and it\u2019s frustrating as heck as it\u2019s always the wronged party being told to fix things. It\u2019s them not willingly admitting their daughter was in the wrong. Divorce or not it\u2019s not an excuse to treat others crap especially a child. The fact they\u2019re telling you to be the bigger person shows they know no matter how wrong she was that she won\u2019t apologise or admit she was wrong, so they default to blaming the victim for not putting up with it. They don\u2019t care she caused this they just want the boat to stop being rocked so hold it against the victim even when her sister is the one running back and forward trying to tip the boat.   \nJust to add never bite the hand that feeds you.

I think that it is your response that is honestly preventing her from doing so. You immediately went to full defensive mode instead of trying to work through the problem. I don\u2019t know much about your sister\u2019s relationship with her ex, but in a lot of failed relationships, there is usually someone immature that is trying to be controlling and abuse the situation. Your sister might have just triggered a fight or flight response because that\u2019s all she can rationalize right now. It\u2019s not going to make it easier for her to forgive you to take a long time to work with her and forgive her. \n\nI think that you acted rationally at the time, but since she does seem willing to apologize and reconcile with you, it becomes vital that you reach out and make amends. I think that the longer you take to recognize that you completely cut her out of your life over a misunderstanding, the harder it will be for you to rebuild that relationship with your sister.

I imagine this is left over sibling rivalry making a mess of things. Similarly you need to act and not react emotionally.
