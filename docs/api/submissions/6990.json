My husband was not the first born and isn\u2019t named William, so I didn\u2019t think the \u2018traditional\u2019 naming would be passed on to us.

Yeah, you both should name the baby whatever y\u2019all choose to, but yelling at your MIL about it was probably uncalled for. You couldn\u2019t just calmly say that you and your husband will decide on a name together bc that\u2019s your family\u2019s tradition? Also, if she\u2019s trying to talk to you, she might have come to here senses, but you\u2019re just ignoring her. Is your plan to just ignore her forever?", "ESH, you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her, but family traditions like that are a little outdated so I understand not wanting to carry on with it, especially not of it will encourage someone to believe their dead child has been reincarnated into your child, that doesn\u2019t sound healthy.", "INFO: Did this issue never come up before, when you and your husband first started talking about getting married, or raising children together, or planning the gender reveal party? \n\nWhen did you discover that the tradition would be \"passed on\" to your husband?", "ESH.  You, for yelling, when it was clearly an area of sensitivity for her.  And her for trying to force a decision upon you which doesn't belong to her.  The issue of reincarnation also opens the door to her having an unhealthy relationship with her grandchild, in believing it is her own, again.  \n\nSo she needs to acknowledge the child as being their own, independent, individual.  And you need to be nicer about painful issue of her losing a child.", "Info - why was this not discussed ahead of time?", "As others have pointed out, the manner in which you addressed this might make you the AH here.  Was this an issue that has been discussed previously?  Have you made it known to your MIL that you were not going to participate in this tradition?  She's a bit presumptuous for thinking that you will, but someone should have had this discussion with her.  If you have, then you're not an AH.  If you haven't, blowing up at her makes you an AH.", "I'm gonna with NAH. Yeah, you yelled at her. Yeah, she's going through some emotions.  However, you're carrying this baby, you're probably hormonal and of course going through the physical ramifications of carrying the baby. I can understand where you're coming from.\n\nIn regards to your MIL, it's clear she hasn't had any kind of therapy or healing, so I can see why she would've wanted this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope your husband takes your side on other problems between you and your mom and won't always side with his mommy though.", "INFO\nDid you ever discuss the naming tradition with your husband?\nHow does HE feel about the names?\n\nAmazingly this isn't only your child.\n\nYou suck for yelling at your MIL, ESPECIALLY in front of a bunch of people in her own home.\n\nShe sucks for the weird 'reincarnation' thing.  Could be a cultural thing but it still is a weird vibe.", "I think NTA, because your MILs thinking will be extremely unhealthy for your child. I assume they will have same names like her dead kid and it will make it only worse just. Not sure the yelling was necessary but I would have been shocked to hear that too. If it's just about the name I'd say you're overreacting but this \"through your baby mine comes back\"\nis seriously disturbing.", "I'm going with NTA, but I'm missing something - \n\nWhat conversation did you and your husband have with respect to names?  You both have equal say in this (and I'm a firm believer in \"two yeses or one no\" when it comes to picking names).\n\nYour MIL is out of line and sounds a bit crazy. I'll pardon her based on grief, but she's still in the wrong.", "I believe in reincarnation but I absolutely can't stand when people think their passed loved one is their grandkid/niece/nephew/etc. That isn't really how reincarnation works. It honestly sends alarms blaring when that happens.\n\nYou, dear, are NTA. I would even say that for your child safety that you don't use those names at all just to remind you MIL that this is, in fact, not her child in any way or form. I know she's probably still grieving, but she'll definitely use the name to trauma bond and it wouldn't surprise me if she were to try and take on parenting roles and undermine your relationship with your daughter.\n\nIf your husband is really dedicated to following the tradition, you could try to modernize it or make it a middle name, but I think naming your daughter \"Diana\" would do a lot more harm than good.", "ESH, but close to N T A\n\nYou shouldn't have yelled, but MIL is incredibly out of line. Claiming that your unborn child is the reincarnation of her dead daughter is incredibly abusive. MIL needs to sort herself out before she starts inflicting this nonsense on your child.", "YTA for yelling at her. You could have just told her you were picking a different name.", "So your MIL let you use her house to host a party, she was going through some emotions because she was reminded of the child she had that died... and you yelled at her.\n\nGee. I wonder why your husband thinks yta. (he is right btw)\n\nYou are right to think it's your decision to name your child what you and your husband want. But your behavior was definitely not cool.", "YTA, strictly for the yelling.  Dont get me wrong, name your kid what you like. And yeah MIL has some issues possibly. But you yelled at her, I'm assuming infront of friends and family which is an AH move. You should have had calm discussion afterwards.", "YTA for how you said it, not what you said. Name your kid whatever you want. But try empathy and perspective over aggression and you'll have better results.", "ESH you shouldn't have yelled but I agree your MIL is overstepping", "YTA. I get it, you don't like the name, but as soon as this happened you \"lost it\" and yelled at your MIL? It doesn't even sound like there was a discussion. Further, your MIL \\*might\\* and I can only assume since you don't say, want to talk to you to either try and persuade you (which might be a bad idea) or apologize for upsetting you. \n\nYou have the right to name your child what you want, but that doesn't mean you get to fly off the handle and start yelling at people. And what if your husband likes the name, are you cutting his input out as well?", "ESH \n\nDon\u2019t be yelling. And don\u2019t follow her tradition if you don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s your kids, so name them what you want. \n\nOr go get a pet and name it William or Diana and call your new fur baby your first child.", "YTA for handling it the way you did. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to name your kid that but also don\u2019t trash a name that means so much to her due to her dead kid. Clearly she\u2019s emotional and you shouldn\u2019t have even had the party there knowing that this tradition and her beliefs would be so present. \n\nAlso, why did she even still think you\u2019re following the naming tradition? Your partner has had months to clear that up with his mom prior to this event.", "NTA. This is not her child, it is yours. I would actively remove that name from the list even if I otherwise liked it.", "Yta for how you handled it.", "NTA\n\nNaming a child takes two yes, yours and your husband's. You have all the right to veto any name you don't want.\n\nAlso, it's utterly sick to name a child after a deceased one and treat it as a reincarnation or something. It's a different child. Even if you liked the name, I strongly advise you not to.", "YTA for how you handled yourself and upsetting your MIL who was already emotional.\n\nBut I agree with the naming thing. Don't do it. As soon as the in laws started trying to get me to name my child something in their family, that was it, all family names were off the table to make a point.", "YTA. I don't disagree with you, but can you not articulate yourself without yelling? It just sounds like you went from 0 to 100 here.\n\nAlso no need to insult the name Diana.", "NTA.\n\nDo not allow your child to live in the shadow of someone else\u2019s dead kid. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA\n\nNo doubt you're hormonal and this is Your baby.\n\nBig nope on someone else naming baby after dead person.", "Names should be decided by both parents together, as it's their baby. Your MIL overstepped by insisting on this naming tradition. That being said, Diana and William are lovely names that are still popular, and you went too far by yelling at your MIL when she was clearly reliving grief that you seem to dismiss the severity of. You're also an AH for not allowing your MIL to reach out. **ESH**", "YTA -\n\nWhether or not you want to go with that name is irrelevant - you handled things very poorly. \n\nPeople grieve and deal with the loss of a child in many different ways but no one ever truly gets over it. I pray you never know that pain. You could been a lot more sensitive and waiting until after the party to discuss the baby's name. \n\nBTW - You can always follow the tradition but use the baby's middle name as what you call her. \n\nEither way, you really should apologize for how you reacted. I get your hormonal and pregnant (I've been there) but that is not an excuse for poor behavior.", "I think you're NTA. But I think that if you're willing to compromise, then you could give your daughter the middle name Diana (insert actual traditional name here). The only caveat I would say is apologize for yelling at MIL, but that your words stand strong.", "Mildly yta. Listen, just name the kid whatever you'd like, but you won't come off looking great losing it on somebody missing their dead child. It's weird that she's making it your problem, but just chill and go about your business.", "YTA. Girl why did you yell at her like that? Literally why? You shouldn\u2019t be having a fucking kid if your first response is to yell when you don\u2019t like something. I feel sorry for your unborn child wow.", "YTA.", "YTA for how you handled this and honestly for throwing shade at what is most likely a lovely name, especially compared to some of the vowel/consonant salad that are \u201cnames\u201d nowadays like \u201cKhayte\u201d (that\u2019s pronounced \u201cKate\u201d) and \u201cMadysyn\u201d and \u201cAppyl\u201d and all the rest\u2026 Not saying you have to use the name, but some tact wouldn\u2019t be amiss.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

On purpose!) and you yelled at her. What's up with that?\n\nYou do have to eat crow and apologize because you behaved terribly and were so mean to her. \n\nYou don't have to name the baby Diana.", "While you are well within your rights to name your child whatever you want yelling at your MIL was not the best way to handle this..Your DH needs to talk to his mom and make sure she realizes this child is not MIL' s reborn child.  This child is her grandchild.  I would be worried about MIL' s mental health.  You and DH need to have a calm discussion about the name. This why gender reveals suck..ESH.", "ESH.", "ESH. I can understand that you don't want to follow the tradition, but yelling at her is a bit too much imho.\n\nAt least if that occasion was the first time she mentioned it.", "I completely understand not wanting to follow through on a tradition you have no affinity for. But what about using it as a middle name?  It honors the husband\u2019s family tradition and your child will still have the first name you choose. Or middle name. My youngest has two middle names.", "ESH- MIL shouldn\u2019t have assumed she would choose the name especially without broaching the subject with you first. Second, you knowing about the tradition should have made an effort to have a discussion before the gender reveal about your intentions for the baby\u2019s name instead of laying in wait to throw a tantrum at the reveal. Everyone needs lessons in communication skills here.", "YTA.\nCall the baby what you want,  but don't yell at your husband's family.", "If you told them before that you don't want to name your child like that, I would go ESH, but I guess you would have mentioned.\nThat's why YTA. No one attacked you but you blew up at your MIL who had an emotional moment. Sure, her problems aren't yours, but that doesn't justify your rude behavior.\nBesides, I would really be interested in your husband's opinion on the names. After all, he has as much say in this as you do.", "ESH. How was this the first time this came up? You didn\u2019t need to yell that to someone already having a hard time. You have the right to name your child whatever you want but so does your husband. Did he want to follow the tradition?", "NTA but you probably could have handled that better. \u201cThank you for the suggestion but I\u2019ll pass\u201d", "ESH because, at least based on what you've said, it doesn't sound like you ever had a proper discussion about baby names with your MIL or husband. MIL is presumptuous to just assume the name will be Diana, but it sounds very much like you yelled at her almost unprovoked during a sensitive moment for her.\n\nIf you have indeed already discussed this with her though then NTA and you shouldn't be held to that family tradition. These are the names of your children, not some hand me down heirlooms, and it already seems unhealthy and red-flag-y that MIL would have this level of attachment to your child.", "YTA. You chose to have your MIL host your huge party but you didn\u2019t talk to her about these passed on names before? You knew she was going to have feelings about this, but neither you nor her husband chose to have a conversation in advance. I had to scroll up to find your ages again because you handled this like a teenager.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. You for flipping out on your MIL in what sounds like a very nasty way, your MIL for assuming you were going to follow this tradition and for making your baby \u201chers\u201d but most of all your husband for not making it clear to his mom ahead of time that you are not following that tradition so mil could temper her expectations.", "NTA. Your MIL will see her deceased child in your child. And this will make her become mentally ill. It's not a joke. My grandma got severe depression after losing her baby many decades ago and when I became a father her depression came back when she saw my child. And the worst is she got violent with my kid. She said: \"Come to mommy(Not even grandma)\" and my kid was reluctant to go she started grabbing her in an aggressive way. Like I told you to come to mommy. \n\nPlus, you are 7 months pregnant and your hormones are on fire. So anyone saying things like that about your precious baby would make you lose your cool.", "YTA. You could have explained it to her like Dumbledore did in the book instead you responded like Dumbledore did in the movie.", "Can someone tell me what ESH means? Everyone stupid here?", "YTA. You jump straight to yelling? Maturity at its finest \ud83d\ude44", "NTA.\n\nYour mil is delusional.  Yelling at her is fine.  She has no business interfering or inserting herself in the naming, and you need to make your boundaries CLEAR.  Do not discuss the naming with her again.  Don't try to convince her, don't argue, if she tries to talk about it, end the conversation.  Do not allow her to insert herself in the naming conversation.  Your husband doesn't like it?  Well, if had done his job, your mil would not have opened her mouth about the name, and this would not have happened.", "I have to laugh at \u201cnaming traditions\u201d. My mothers family passed down the name as the middle name. My mother hated her middle name and refused to give it to me.\n\nI just did the family tree for my mum, and discovered that what my mum had been told was \u201cthe family name\u201d wasn\u2019t. Her mother hated it so used HER given name as the replacement. My family name should have been Eleanor and not Grace. I think if my mum had known that I would have been the bearer of Eleanor as a middle name and not the one my parents chose instead.\n\nI (and my daughter both) LIKE Eleanor and would have been happy to have had that. Why my maternal grandmother hated it is not known. My daughter has said that IF she ever has a daughter (unlikely as she is now 42 and childless) she will be reinstating it.", " NTA", "Idc what everybody says, NTA. At all.\n\nIf you CANNOT comprehend that everyone has a breaking point, do not even begin judging in AITA reddit posts.\n\nThe child is YOURS and your HUSBAND's. It is to no one else to name YOUR kids. \n\nDo not expect the chat or your MIL to grow up any time soon \n\n \"Not everyone is ready to be unplugged\" quote by morphius in the matrix movie - (means not everyone is ready to accept reality, the truth of how the world is and always has been).", "NTA, this is how you lose contact with your grandchild - by being an overstepping grandmom. So sorry your husband wouldn\u2019t stick up for you.", "NTA. Your mother in law thinks your carrying her reincarnated child and your husband the baby\u2019s father thinks your the one that being an AH. I would be very clear with your husband that you and he made this kid with the sex you had and your the one carrying the kid you both created. At no point did your mil have anything to do with this and implying this is her kid is beyond sick and twisted. Be very clear you won\u2019t stand for this and if he is willing to then he also has some serious issues.", "NTA. Could you have handled it better, absolutely. But in the moment, when your MIL was saying those things, you let go. Talk to your MIL now though. Let\u2019s hope things work out. Congrats on the baby.", "Not to mention conveniently \"forgetting\" to bring up to anyone that she doesn't plan on continuing the family naming tradition so she can have a big party at MIL's house. Did OP really think it wasn't going to come up?\n\nI also think OP is a bigger asshole for making me so fucking curious what this \"old victorian name\" that's so awful and ugly is now lol", "How do you get 7 months into a pregnancy and not have this conversation?! Surely names have been spoken about.", "When she was crying over her dead daughter was probably the worst time to bring this up. I can\u2019t believe neither OP nor her husband foresaw this happening \u2014 the husband especially since it\u2019s his mom. OP can obviously do what she wants, but MIL isn\u2019t necessarily the AH because no one told her the naming tradition wouldn\u2019t continue, which would have given her the chance to grieve in private \u2014 and this WAS a very emotional moment for her. People aren\u2019t always rational when something like this is sprung on them, much as I would also hate being told what to do if I were OP.", "YTA \n\nfor how you said it, not what you said. Name your kid whatever you want. But try empathy and perspective over aggression and you'll have better results.", "I was thinking the exact same thing. MIL will try to take over parenting this a baby to relieve her grief over losing her own daughter. MIL needs therapy and OP should definitely use a different name. I also find it awful when parents try to guilt their adult children into naming their own child something of their choice. You had your turn to name your children, now it\u2019s theirs.", "Yeah, I cringe whenever I hear someone pronouncing that someone, especially a baby, is the reincarnation of a loved one who's passed. Uh, no, they're their own person first. Maybe reincarnation is real in some ways, like people experiencing past life memories (Personally I've had some really weird dreams that I can't connect to my own life at all. Maybe they are memories of a past life, who knows?) but regardless, everyone has their own life and personality FIRST. Unless the MIL gets some serious therapy, I would be wary of letting her be alone with this kid. Who knows what kind of nonsense and wishful thinking she'll spout at her?", "The actual names are beside the point. I'm curious too of course but you know if OP specified the names then 75% of the comments would devolve into arguing over whether the names are actually old fashioned or poised to make a comeback, and whether they'd really lead to bullying or not", "I'm guessing it's something akin to Edith, Maude, Whilemmina, Prudence, etc. None of which are terrible or extinct, but are definitely far less common now than in my great+ grandmother's era.", "William and Diana aren't even the old style names. Seriously, it's less about the names and more of OP just fighting against tradition.", "The old Victorian name got me too. OP chose fake names, and maybe it's just because I'm a Brit and there's a lot going on with our monarchy this week, but Diana and William, really?! They couldn't come up with a better, more apt example? It just makes me think the real name isn't that old sounding. Besides which, aren't traditional names making a comeback because they're \"unusual\"?\n\nNot that any of this matters. I'm just intruiged. Still ESH. No one handled this well. Apart from the poor psrty guests who had to awkwardly stand around eating cake but absolutely told this story to everyone at work Monday morning.", "The only gender reveal party I have ever liked was a diaper keg/gender reveal and the announcement was she colored in pink on a hershy bar.", "100%. That's one of the main topics during pregnancy???? Doesn't matter if you know the gender picking names for a boy or girl is discussed before you know.", "My thing is that I believe in reincarnation. Soon after I lost my son, one of my best friends got pregnant. I didn't sit there thinking that it was *my baby* and he just mommy hopped to someone in my life to be close to me. That's very selfish thinking. For all I know my son was reincarnated in Korea as some kid named Il-Jeong Seoul and I understood that.\n\nThis definitely needs therapy. I don't say that to be undermining what she's been through, but it can definitely help her process grief and understand that her way of thinking is *not* okay.", "[deleted]", "Yeah, I would be completely freaked out. Yes, it was rude of OP to yell at her, but I would be angry and a little scared, too, if someone told me that my unborn child was the reincarnation of THEIR deceased child, especially at a celebration. Uh, no, let's stop that crazy train right now.", "Weird to admit that you're as emotionally unstable and easily triggered as OP, but okay.", "She said those were fake names she was using as examples.", "There is no reason to tolerate offensive stuff", "Good point. I missed that. But if they were horrible or outdated, why not specifically mention that or give as examples?  I think there is a way to compromise with MIL to honor tradition but not burden the baby with a first name that OP doesn\u2019t like. Many children have family names as middle names. Many children also have more than one middle name.", "That\u2019s why they should have discussed it during a calmer moment when emotions weren\u2019t running high."]}
