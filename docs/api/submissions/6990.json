My husband was not the first born and isn\u2019t named William, so I didn\u2019t think the \u2018traditional\u2019 naming would be passed on to us.

Yeah, you both should name the baby whatever y\u2019all choose to, but yelling at your MIL about it was probably uncalled for. You couldn\u2019t just calmly say that you and your husband will decide on a name together bc that\u2019s your family\u2019s tradition? Also, if she\u2019s trying to talk to you, she might have come to here senses, but you\u2019re just ignoring her. Is your plan to just ignore her forever?", "ESH, you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her, but family traditions like that are a little outdated so I understand not wanting to carry on with it, especially not of it will encourage someone to believe their dead child has been reincarnated into your child, that doesn\u2019t sound healthy.", "INFO: Did this issue never come up before, when you and your husband first started talking about getting married, or raising children together, or planning the gender reveal party? \n\nWhen did you discover that the tradition would be \"passed on\" to your husband?", "ESH.  You, for yelling, when it was clearly an area of sensitivity for her.  And her for trying to force a decision upon you which doesn't belong to her.  The issue of reincarnation also opens the door to her having an unhealthy relationship with her grandchild, in believing it is her own, again.  \n\nSo she needs to acknowledge the child as being their own, independent, individual.  And you need to be nicer about painful issue of her losing a child.", "Info - why was this not discussed ahead of time?", "As others have pointed out, the manner in which you addressed this might make you the AH here.  Was this an issue that has been discussed previously?  Have you made it known to your MIL that you were not going to participate in this tradition?  She's a bit presumptuous for thinking that you will, but someone should have had this discussion with her.  If you have, then you're not an AH.  If you haven't, blowing up at her makes you an AH.", "I'm gonna with NAH. Yeah, you yelled at her. Yeah, she's going through some emotions.  However, you're carrying this baby, you're probably hormonal and of course going through the physical ramifications of carrying the baby. I can understand where you're coming from.\n\nIn regards to your MIL, it's clear she hasn't had any kind of therapy or healing, so I can see why she would've wanted this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope your husband takes your side on other problems between you and your mom and won't always side with his mommy though.", "INFO\nDid you ever discuss the naming tradition with your husband?\nHow does HE feel about the names?\n\nAmazingly this isn't only your child.\n\nYou suck for yelling at your MIL, ESPECIALLY in front of a bunch of people in her own home.\n\nShe sucks for the weird 'reincarnation' thing.  Could be a cultural thing but it still is a weird vibe.", "I think NTA, because your MILs thinking will be extremely unhealthy for your child. I assume they will have same names like her dead kid and it will make it only worse just. Not sure the yelling was necessary but I would have been shocked to hear that too. If it's just about the name I'd say you're overreacting but this \"through your baby mine comes back\"\nis seriously disturbing.", "I'm going with NTA, but I'm missing something - \n\nWhat conversation did you and your husband have with respect to names?  You both have equal say in this (and I'm a firm believer in \"two yeses or one no\" when it comes to picking names).\n\nYour MIL is out of line and sounds a bit crazy. I'll pardon her based on grief, but she's still in the wrong.", "I believe in reincarnation but I absolutely can't stand when people think their passed loved one is their grandkid/niece/nephew/etc. That isn't really how reincarnation works. It honestly sends alarms blaring when that happens.\n\nYou, dear, are NTA. I would even say that for your child safety that you don't use those names at all just to remind you MIL that this is, in fact, not her child in any way or form. I know she's probably still grieving, but she'll definitely use the name to trauma bond and it wouldn't surprise me if she were to try and take on parenting roles and undermine your relationship with your daughter.\n\nIf your husband is really dedicated to following the tradition, you could try to modernize it or make it a middle name, but I think naming your daughter \"Diana\" would do a lot more harm than good.", "ESH, but close to N T A\n\nYou shouldn't have yelled, but MIL is incredibly out of line. Claiming that your unborn child is the reincarnation of her dead daughter is incredibly abusive. MIL needs to sort herself out before she starts inflicting this nonsense on your child.", "YTA for yelling at her. You could have just told her you were picking a different name.", "So your MIL let you use her house to host a party, she was going through some emotions because she was reminded of the child she had that died... and you yelled at her.\n\nGee. I wonder why your husband thinks yta. (he is right btw)\n\nYou are right to think it's your decision to name your child what you and your husband want. But your behavior was definitely not cool.", "YTA, strictly for the yelling.  Dont get me wrong, name your kid what you like. And yeah MIL has some issues possibly. But you yelled at her, I'm assuming infront of friends and family which is an AH move. You should have had calm discussion afterwards.", "YTA for how you said it, not what you said. Name your kid whatever you want. But try empathy and perspective over aggression and you'll have better results.", "ESH you shouldn't have yelled but I agree your MIL is overstepping", "YTA. I get it, you don't like the name, but as soon as this happened you \"lost it\" and yelled at your MIL? It doesn't even sound like there was a discussion. Further, your MIL \\*might\\* and I can only assume since you don't say, want to talk to you to either try and persuade you (which might be a bad idea) or apologize for upsetting you. \n\nYou have the right to name your child what you want, but that doesn't mean you get to fly off the handle and start yelling at people. And what if your husband likes the name, are you cutting his input out as well?", "ESH \n\nDon\u2019t be yelling. And don\u2019t follow her tradition if you don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s your kids, so name them what you want. \n\nOr go get a pet and name it William or Diana and call your new fur baby your first child.", "YTA for handling it the way you did. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to name your kid that but also don\u2019t trash a name that means so much to her due to her dead kid. Clearly she\u2019s emotional and you shouldn\u2019t have even had the party there knowing that this tradition and her beliefs would be so present. \n\nAlso, why did she even still think you\u2019re following the naming tradition? Your partner has had months to clear that up with his mom prior to this event.", "NTA. This is not her child, it is yours. I would actively remove that name from the list even if I otherwise liked it.", "Yta for how you handled it.", "NTA\n\nNaming a child takes two yes, yours and your husband's. You have all the right to veto any name you don't want.\n\nAlso, it's utterly sick to name a child after a deceased one and treat it as a reincarnation or something. It's a different child. Even if you liked the name, I strongly advise you not to.", "YTA for how you handled yourself and upsetting your MIL who was already emotional.\n\nBut I agree with the naming thing. Don't do it. As soon as the in laws started trying to get me to name my child something in their family, that was it, all family names were off the table to make a point.", "YTA. I don't disagree with you, but can you not articulate yourself without yelling? It just sounds like you went from 0 to 100 here.\n\nAlso no need to insult the name Diana.", "NTA.\n\nDo not allow your child to live in the shadow of someone else\u2019s dead kid. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA\n\nNo doubt you're hormonal and this is Your baby.\n\nBig nope on someone else naming baby after dead person.", "Names should be decided by both parents together, as it's their baby. Your MIL overstepped by insisting on this naming tradition. That being said, Diana and William are lovely names that are still popular, and you went too far by yelling at your MIL when she was clearly reliving grief that you seem to dismiss the severity of. You're also an AH for not allowing your MIL to reach out. **ESH**", "YTA -\n\nWhether or not you want to go with that name is irrelevant - you handled things very poorly. \n\nPeople grieve and deal with the loss of a child in many different ways but no one ever truly gets over it. I pray you never know that pain. You could been a lot more sensitive and waiting until after the party to discuss the baby's name. \n\nBTW - You can always follow the tradition but use the baby's middle name as what you call her. \n\nEither way, you really should apologize for how you reacted. I get your hormonal and pregnant (I've been there) but that is not an excuse for poor behavior.", "I think you're NTA. But I think that if you're willing to compromise, then you could give your daughter the middle name Diana (insert actual traditional name here). The only caveat I would say is apologize for yelling at MIL, but that your words stand strong.", "Mildly yta. Listen, just name the kid whatever you'd like, but you won't come off looking great losing it on somebody missing their dead child. It's weird that she's making it your problem, but just chill and go about your business.", "YTA. Girl why did you yell at her like that? Literally why? You shouldn\u2019t be having a fucking kid if your first response is to yell when you don\u2019t like something. I feel sorry for your unborn child wow.", "YTA.", "YTA for how you handled this and honestly for throwing shade at what is most likely a lovely name, especially compared to some of the vowel/consonant salad that are \u201cnames\u201d nowadays like \u201cKhayte\u201d (that\u2019s pronounced \u201cKate\u201d) and \u201cMadysyn\u201d and \u201cAppyl\u201d and all the rest\u2026 Not saying you have to use the name, but some tact wouldn\u2019t be amiss.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's kinda the same experience I have when people try to show me their grandchildren on Facebook at work.", "You're missing the \"I want an excuse to start a massive forest fire that will cause millions in property damage\" type of people.", "The original gender reveal party was a blogger who was celebrating finally carrying a pregnancy to the 20-week mark and being able to find out the gender (after multiple miscarriages). She regrets starting the whole thing and it turned out her kid is trans/nb so the gender they revealed didn't fit anyhow.", "Also that child has since come out as non-binary I believe, which is TRULY the icing on the  metaphorical cake \ud83e\udd23", "Same. I'm not big on gender reveal parties as a concept, but I am a huge proponent of happiness and free food, so I'll gladly celebrate the gender of your unborn child for the sake of fun and food.", "I hope you and your partner got a healthy baby.

Some of them have ended up with people injured or killed.", "I'm not really \\*into\\* the concept of gender reveal parties as a whole, but I can't really argue with an excuse to celebrate and have cake, so I'm not opposed to those kinds of gender reveal parties. As soon as I started hearing stories about gender reveal parties with explosives, I decided I was completely over the concept.\n\nAnd I also hate when a gender reveal party where one or both parents is upset with the result goes viral. You're having a kid! Just be happy with that! I'd be devastated if I was that kid and I found out about that.", "It\u2019s at least partially cause of the wildfires and deaths that gender reveal parties have caused", "I don't remember if the kid is actually nonbinary or just doesn't conform to gender norms. Last I heard the kid still identified as a cis girl but didn't conform to female gender norms, but even that was enough to change the originator's views on gender.", "Awe!! Yay!", "YTA for yelling. You could have just calmly told her no and softened the reason.", "YTA - I see where your coming from with not naming your child as per tradition. \n\nBut YTA for how you handled this.

It's no one else's decision.  MIL needs therapy.", "ESH...you didn't have to freak out.  You could have just let her ramble on and then name the baby whatever you want when it's born.  MIL needs some therapy...but you need some anger management classes.", "ESH.\nGender reveals are stupid and you're an AH for having one.\nYour MIL needs therapy.\nYou yelled over this?", "Insensitive you are. Put yourself in her shoes and be as kind as you wish you were treated in her position. With love you can help her understand. You marry her son, if you love him the relationship with her HAS to work, he loves the both of you, and will love you more if you are kind to her", "NTA - you and your husband have to agree on a name, you have already said no to Diane and that's that.", "NTA.\n\nYour MIL needs to understand that she's your baby, not hers. Beyond that, my dudedette, you're pregnant. Could you have handled this better? Sure. But again, you're pregnant which means sometimes, the baby hormones do the talking - or the yelling. Your MIL should have stepped back and waited for a better time to have a discussion", "ESH", "Why did you yell at her? Why are you not talking it out with her\u2014calmly explaining your point of view rather than yelling at her?You are NTA for not wanting to give your child a name you don\u2019t like. But you are definitely TA for yelling at her and refusing to talk to her about it. Why did you not discuss this with her from the very beginning of your pregnancy rather than let her go 7 months believing you would follow tradition?", "We dont meet Agathas anymore for a reason - justifiable double barrels", "\n\nShe's 7 months pregnant. And why should she have to be calm? Great that the family has traditions, but this is not her MIL's kid.

She had one of each, a boy & a girl.", "Nothing wrong with either of those names. I know a couple of Vincents that go by Vinny, never heard of them having issues.", "This is the important comment. I'm not really worried about the naming tradition so much as MIL thinking this is her reincarnated child. That's just messed up.", "I wonder what these attention seekers would have done before ultra sounds were invented & nobody knew the child's gender until it was born.", "Thank you. And yes ... and yes (although my partner is still oblivious that the cat is a foster failure).", "Two dogs with excellent theme songs", "Even more then that. We know they live AT LEAST that long. Parrot husbandry has come a long way in recent years. My Macaw was at least is his late forties and spent the first thirty of it in smoke filled bars eating peanuts and who knows what else.
