Their father is also a volatile, scary guy. \n\nHer cousin\u2019s kids had behavioral issues I have never seen before. 4M is selectively mute and 3F has raging tantrums, and the weirdest triggers. Ex. My gf took off the kids socks for bath time, so she ran and hid under the coffee table, screaming and crying uncontrollably for 4 hours. Turns out 3F does not allow anybody to see her bare feet. \n\nThe first month was hell. The mute boy was mischievous, and the raging 3 year old was always shrieking. \n\nBut my gf had a plan: establish safety and build trust. Her theory was that these kids were acting out because of anxiety and trauma, and they associate grownups with pain and fear. Therefore, their behavior would change once they felt safe and protected in their new environment. She implemented rules for grownups in her house, and I follow them religiously. They were the same rules she\u2019s had since before I met her, but now they're written down on a whiteboard in the kitchen.\n\nAnd it worked. It\u2019s been 6 months, and the last tantrum was months ago. Moreover, they finally got in with a trauma therapist who was so impressed with my gf and he validated everything she implemented. I need to make this woman my wife lol. \n\nAnyway, my best friend visited for the first time in 8 months. He hates kids. He needed a ride home and my gf was taking all the kids to the park, and offered to drive him. \n\n15 minutes later, he\u2019s calling me, screaming about how my gf threw him out on the side of the road. \n\nThe full story is that the toddlers started to cry, and my friend turned and screamed \u201cZIP IT!\u201d So my gf kicked him out a mile away from his house, and went to the park. \n\nI told my friend that\u2019s fair, everybody knows my gf does not tolerate shouting, she\u2019s trying to show two traumatized children that they are safe with her, and you screamed at her kid, while she was doing you a favor and driving you home. If you scared her kid, and she tolerated it and kept driving you, it would show the kids that she tolerates dangerous, short tempered people. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like taking care of 2 traumatized children with behavior problems, so \u2026 respect the rules. \n\nBut now the entire friend group is against us, saying my gf is raising \u201cspoiled woke sissies\u201d. That the real world doesn\u2019t follow her neat little rules. gentle parenting doesn\u2019t work. everyone gets yelled at, they have to deal with it. And ofc, everyone thinks she was crazy and cruel for kicking him out of her car and that i\u2019m a simp, wrapped around her finger\n\nIt\u2019s not like she left him on the highway. he was a mile from home, and he\u2019s fully able bodied. Stop screaming at my kids and get some exercise. \n\nExcept now I have no friends, which is making me second guess myself", "created_utc": 1681592214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nidd5/aita_for_letting_my_girlfriend_kicking_my_best/", "score": 2178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I smiled when you said you should marry her haha, so nice that you can see what a great human you have in front of you. 6 months isn\u2019t that long and it is easy to traumatize children that have already been traumatized.

It's kind of a relief honestly.\n\nEdit: There were times where my mom would later apologize to me though and then forcefully hug me while I'm sitting there feeling upset and I wouldn't reciprocate either.\n\nEdit: Thing is, I'm also a hugger too.", "u/malin65 100%. Like I teared up reading your comment. World needs more normal people, OP needs to find his people.", "yes i would if they were behaving like a toddler - toddlers randomly cry and aren\u2019t emotionally stable, why would i need to shout at an adult whos not throwing a tantrum but probably letting out their true emotions", "ye why would i be around uncontrollable kids with incompetent parents lmao", " Wow. Stay away from children if you can\u2019t handle them acting like children without screaming at them.", "Please stay in your moms basement as much as possible. Most people need to touch grass, but for public safety reasons please don\u2019t.", "Ah there it is.   \n\n\nOPs girlfriend has proven her competence here. And it's \\*never\\* acceptable to yell at someone elses' children.", "\"uncontrollable kids\"- \"traumatized children\"  \n\"incompetent parents\"-\"people adopting a specific plan of action to rectify a terrible situation\"  \n\n\nHonestly, sounds like you'd fit right in with OP's buddies here. Perhaps you need to mature a bit so you can stop taking \"random shit I think\" as some sort of authoritative way that others need to conduct themselves around all important YOU.", "At least on the competence point\u2026if the bsf knew nothing about it it would just seem like bad parenting. He shouldn\u2019t have yelled but thinking it\u2019s bad parenting wouldn\u2019t be his fault.", "if you read my comment before that, you would know i am not implying op\u2019s girlfriend\n\nand yes it is. it really is. holy shit it so fully is. there are many instances where it is.", "Clearly you didn\u2019t actually read their response and just went off. This is from the POV of the friend who presumably knew nothing about the past trauma. Yelling was way over the line, I agree, but it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that these were uncontrollable kids if they had no context.", "Yeah there are instances to yell at a child like \u201cdon\u2019t touch that!\u201d If they are in immediate danger. Yelling \u201czip it!\u201d at a crying toddler is never acceptable let alone a toddler that is not yours. It\u2019s laughable that you think this fully grown adult deserves more grace than a child \ud83d\ude02 if he knew he was that bothered by children why ask for a favor from someone with kids? Take an Uber and control yourself", "No. Not at all. Not a fucking THREE year old.", "I'm aware what point of view it's from, dumbfuck, try reading a bit better next time? I'm stating that it's not their place to decide what constitutes \"uncontrollable kids\", especially if as you say, they don't really know anything about why that might be the case. This individual has no responsibility in the situation. They're not his fucking kids, it's not his fucking place to say what should or shouldnt be happening. And likewise, because he has no responsibility and no actual information to justify conducting himself like that, he should shut the fuck up (just like you should with your dumb \"clearly you didn't read\" bullshit) . But for the sake of argument, what if they're \"uncontrollable kids\" in actuality?\n\nNo one appointed him judge of whose kids are controllable or uncontrollable, no one asked him to \"try and make these kids more controllable\", no one asked him to do fucking anything about anything, so my suggestion is, maybe he should shut the fuck up and not unduly \"take it upon himself\" to sort what the fuck ever out. Much like you didn't need to \"take it upon yourself\" to trundle out here in these comments, trip and fall at the starting line and make a complete ass of yourself.\n\nJust shut the fuck up, that's ALWAYS an option, nobody cares about your appeal to the \"objective concept of uncontrollable children\" and what you or anyone else thinks about how \"they should be handled\", you didn't crack the code, you don't know more then everyone else about how to handle THEIR shit, and no one has to fucking listen to you just spouting off saying whatever fucking bullshit you think as though it contains some universal fucking truth that everyone should stop and nod their heads in agreement over your vaunted sensibilitity.\n\nAnd since you can't god damn read the thread here, let me tell you their actual argument, \"since grown adults also act impulsively, the kids should be held to a higher standard in regards to their \"uncontrollableness\" in comparison to the adult who presumably has had a lifespan to learn how to deal with their impulsiveness which manifests itself as yelling at children and it's actually totally reasonable for an adult to act this way\"."]}
