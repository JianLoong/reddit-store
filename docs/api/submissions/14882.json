Their father is also a volatile, scary guy. \n\nHer cousin\u2019s kids had behavioral issues I have never seen before. 4M is selectively mute and 3F has raging tantrums, and the weirdest triggers. Ex. My gf took off the kids socks for bath time, so she ran and hid under the coffee table, screaming and crying uncontrollably for 4 hours. Turns out 3F does not allow anybody to see her bare feet. \n\nThe first month was hell. The mute boy was mischievous, and the raging 3 year old was always shrieking. \n\nBut my gf had a plan: establish safety and build trust. Her theory was that these kids were acting out because of anxiety and trauma, and they associate grownups with pain and fear. Therefore, their behavior would change once they felt safe and protected in their new environment. She implemented rules for grownups in her house, and I follow them religiously. They were the same rules she\u2019s had since before I met her, but now they're written down on a whiteboard in the kitchen.\n\nAnd it worked. It\u2019s been 6 months, and the last tantrum was months ago. Moreover, they finally got in with a trauma therapist who was so impressed with my gf and he validated everything she implemented. I need to make this woman my wife lol. \n\nAnyway, my best friend visited for the first time in 8 months. He hates kids. He needed a ride home and my gf was taking all the kids to the park, and offered to drive him. \n\n15 minutes later, he\u2019s calling me, screaming about how my gf threw him out on the side of the road. \n\nThe full story is that the toddlers started to cry, and my friend turned and screamed \u201cZIP IT!\u201d So my gf kicked him out a mile away from his house, and went to the park. \n\nI told my friend that\u2019s fair, everybody knows my gf does not tolerate shouting, she\u2019s trying to show two traumatized children that they are safe with her, and you screamed at her kid, while she was doing you a favor and driving you home. If you scared her kid, and she tolerated it and kept driving you, it would show the kids that she tolerates dangerous, short tempered people. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like taking care of 2 traumatized children with behavior problems, so \u2026 respect the rules. \n\nBut now the entire friend group is against us, saying my gf is raising \u201cspoiled woke sissies\u201d. That the real world doesn\u2019t follow her neat little rules. gentle parenting doesn\u2019t work. everyone gets yelled at, they have to deal with it. And ofc, everyone thinks she was crazy and cruel for kicking him out of her car and that i\u2019m a simp, wrapped around her finger\n\nIt\u2019s not like she left him on the highway. he was a mile from home, and he\u2019s fully able bodied. Stop screaming at my kids and get some exercise. \n\nExcept now I have no friends, which is making me second guess myself", "created_utc": 1681592214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nidd5/aita_for_letting_my_girlfriend_kicking_my_best/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope Karma repays her well in life.  She so nice, she even stopped the car to kick out your friend.  I wouldn't have stopped.", "> Except now I have no friends \n\nThat\u2019s okay, you need better ones and now you have a clean slate.\n\nNTA \n\nYour girlfriend sounds like a gem.", "NTA, its better to loose friends like this than putting up with them because they do not understand what others go through in life. What your gf is doing is saintly and not something most people her age would do. Whatever happens, that lady is a keeper and its rare to have someone like that in one's life. Cherish every moment you have with her and life will be a whole lot fulfilling. Wish you well.", "NTA. Follow your heart and marry this woman. She is an amazing mother and your friends are TA. He\u2019s the true example of No good deed goes unpunished. It\u2019s laughable for him to call anyone spoiled if he expects rides.", "NTA. It\u2019s so much easier to continue traumatizing your children instead of unlearning habits that your parents taught you. Your gf is an angel seriously. I smiled when you said you should marry her haha, so nice that you can see what a great human you have in front of you. 6 months isn\u2019t that long and it is easy to traumatize children that have already been traumatized. She showed them that she will always have *their* back which is so important. People who complain about children being \u201cwoke\u201d or \u201csissy\u2019s\u201d, & especially people that complain about gentle parenting, would not be people I would care about losing in my life. You guys are creating and keeping a safe home for those children, be proud of yourselves. \ud83e\udd0d", "NTA - you did the right thing and respected your girlfriends boundaries with this. She is doing an absolutely AMAZING job in such a hard situation and your best friend could have put that in jeopardy. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong ag all.", "NTA, You don't need friends like these.\n\nIt sounds like your girlfriend is doing an amazing job creating a loving and safe environment for these children. You're right to support her and she needs you more than you know.", "Wowwww y\u2019all need new friends. NTA", "NTA don't second guess yourself, second guess your friends. Adults who have no compassion for traumatized children are not good people and if you are going to make a life with this wonderful woman, these friends are not going to fit in that life. They are like jigsaw puzzle pieces that don't match because the picture has changed. Perhaps talk to your friends individually, state your case and confirm with them that they are OK with grown men shouting at traumatized kids. If they really are, do you want them in your life?", "NTA. Your girlfriend is a much better human being than your best friend or any of your other friends that are on his side. There's no reason to insult children like that, this immediately shows how immature they are. I know it sucks to lose friends but do you really want friends that treat kids (and your significant other) like that?", "NTA As a grown up (55) now, fighting PTSD because of childhood trauma, I would have given everything for such an adult in my life. And you are pretty awesome too for standing up for her", "NTA As you said, you have a truly amazing girlfriend who is focused on making life better for the children and is clearly succeeding. You chose not to support an entitled arsehole and you were absolutely right. Your friends need to grow up.", "NTA Your friends are horrible. It was time for new one. I guess you had them since college and they never grew up. \n\nBtw, i don't like children. Especially screaming or crying is horror for my misophonia. I would never scream at them or say anything mean to them. This is a me-problem. To scream \"zip it!\", just wow. What an AH!", "NTA \n\nEven without the traumatic background, if you scream at my kids, I\u2019m dumping your ass on the side of the road.", "NTA.  These children have been through hell.  They need a safe protective environment in place in order to heal from trauma.  Your friend sounds like an immature AH.  Who yells at someone\u2019s kids when that someone is doing them a favour?  Even without the kids issues this would be an AH move. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your friends don\u2019t understand.  Their comments about \u2018woke sissies\u2019 tells me a lot.  You should find new friends.\n\nYou and your girlfriend sound like amazing people.", "I\u2019d scream \u201czip it!\u201d the next time you\u2019re with your friend group and when they aren\u2019t expecting it and see how quickly they jump. Then point out having that happen as a child with a trauma history. If that doesn\u2019t work I\u2019d get rid of the friends and make her a fianc\u00e9. NTA but YTA if you don\u2019t put your friends in line", "NTA. Do you want just any friends or friends who understand the importance of not screaming at an abused THREE YEAR OLD. Quality over quantity my dude.", "NTA, your friends sound like complete assholes with no idea how to raise children. Is it true the real world doesn't really care about your feelings? Yeah, but they are 3 and 4 years old, who it sounds like spent their entire lives in fear of their father. Nevermind losing their mother on top of that, and moving to a strange place. They are allowed some time to adjust, and 6 months is a short time to already be making good progress. Raising them to be happy and healthy, and then worrying about the real world is still a good way away.\n\nAnd it sounds like your gf has a big heart and she is stepping up for these kids when she has no obligation to do so.", "NTA\n\nY'all need to take care of those poor kids and now they know that you both will 100% stand up to anyone acting hostile towards them. It'll help them feel safer and be more calm.", "NTA - Your group of \"friends\" suck for not understanding the impact of child abuse.", "NTA\n\nYour friends s*ck, with the emotional capacity of a toddler. Marry that girl and find new friends.", "NTA.\n\nYour \u201cbest friend\u201d thought it was acceptable to scream at two tiny humans - survivors of *abuse* - who have been through more trauma in their *incredibly short* lives than anyone should have to deal with ever\u2026 and you and your girlfriend are the problem?\n\nYou need new friends.", "NTA \nScreaming in moving vehicles is idiotic. Sound amplifies and echos due to glass can make it dangerous for the driver. Sudden unexpected sound can cause them to jump and turn wheel.\n\nThat aside what psycho immediately goes to yelling at someone else's kid. The guy should've  let your girlfriend handle the crying kid. At most he could have just asked your girlfriend if that's usual. He couldn't put up with it for 1 mile even. He was so wrong.\n\nFind better friends. Also propose to your girlfriend . \ud83d\ude06", "NTA, and those \"friends\" blatantly showed you they are absolutely not your friends. Your best friend was completely out of bounds regardless of the situation, as unless there is a dangerous situation/emergency, no one should ever scream at someone else's children (or their own).  \n\nI think this has opened up a great opportunity for you to find better friends who will truly be there.", "NTA - stick with your gf - she's an amazing person. Your former friends are all jerks especially your \"best friend\".", "NTA times a million. I wish I had people looking out for me like that when I was little. Please tell your gf to keep being wonderful to those little kiddos. And also, marry her ASAP. Y\u2019all clearly needed new friends. The trash tends to take itself out.", "NTA you never had any friends to begin with if they'll abandon you because you're trying to keep children safe.", "NTA. Your friend hates children but is a complete infant himself. He can't handle the consequences of his actions and dragged others into his pity party. Wow.", "NTA. \n\nYour girlfriend is an excellent, thoughtful, highly competent and loving human. \n\nYour friend is unfit to kiss the hind end of a gonorrhea afflicted mandrill.  I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a non-human species on earth that would accept a creature that knowingly terrorized abused children.  Why do you even consider it?", "Dude. You and your gf are awesome. Wear your capes proudly and tell your various friends to zip it. \n\nNTA. I love you guys. \u2665\ufe0f", "The second I read that your \u201cfriends\u201d called a 3 y/o \u201cwoke\u201d I knew the whole story. They\u2019re not your friends, they\u2019re red neck losers that only care about themselves. Get new friends. NTA.", "NTA. And you\u2019re both incredible for giving those children a safe and caring home to heal and grow.", "NTA! And omg your GF is a Saint. How amazing everything she is doing for those little ones. \n\nYour friends clearly have no clue about children in general and especially ones that have been through such trauma. They are all a**holes!", "NTA your girlfriend sounds like am angel and the type of advocate everybody needs. Get new friends.", "NTA.  Frankly, you need a new friend group if they think taking proper and loving care of traumatized children is a sign of weakness.", "NTA sounds like you are now aware your friends suck and aren't actually your friends.", "NTA\n\nNow you have no friends that think it\u2019s okay to verbally abuse traumatised children. That\u2019s not a loss, it\u2019s a win! \n\nIf you\u2019re in your 30\u2019s then you\u2019re reaching the age where the phrase \u201cyou\u2019re judged by the company you keep\u201d really comes into play. Do you want to be judged as someone who\u2019s like them or as someone who\u2019s like your GF? What kind of person do you want to be?\n\nGo make new (better) friends, and start saving for a ring!", "NTA and no one needs friends who would torture children. You can disliked children, but when you\u2019re willing to lash out at a child for doing child things you\u2019re an abuser in need of a victim. He knew and your friends know the rules and any person with an ounce of empathy would understand the why of them. Don\u2019t mourn those people.", "Nta. Get new friends", "NTA and your friends suck you should find new ones. They aren\u2019t kind people. Taking care of traumatized children has nothing to do with raising \u201cwoke sissies\u201d but your friends are showing you the kind of people they are with those words. You can do better. Your girlfriend is amazing", "Phewwww NTA! \ud83d\udc96", "NTA but also\n\nINFO: does your friend know her and the kids are like that? Us humans naturally get angry or annoyed at things we hate, especially loud unwanted noise. Did she tell him to not do that?
