She's the one who should be apologizing.", "ESH. Your mother needs to rein that temper in asap. No excuses about being Italian.\nHer never having been pregnant actually has nothing to do with this at all. Plenty of women go through pregnancy without experiencing any complications as demonstrated by how you apparently struggled to get a diagnosis. \nYour mother was out of line, yes, and good on you for defending your wife, but what you said was honestly worse.

Your mom knew perfectly well, she just wanted to be a bully to a pregnant woman, probably out of jealously that she can't be pregnant, and then turned on the water works to victimize herself when she was caught so she wouldn't look like the giant asshole she actually is.

When you apologize, you can say (sincerely) that you are sorry you said something that was so painful for her. You can add that, on reflection, it had nothing to do with her not having been pregnant.
