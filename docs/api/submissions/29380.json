{"id": 29380, "submission_id": "17d04cl", "title": "AITA: For wanting to remind my husband of our vows?", "selftext": "Around 2008, I (49F) was diagnosed with Occipital Neuralgia after my neck froze my chin to my chest and the pain was so intense that I couldn't stop screaming. I've had multiple hospitalizations (up to three weeks at a time), surgeries to burn the nerves (radiofrequency), and injections into the base of my skull to help me in between flare-ups. A few years later, I was told I also have Fibromyalgia and you can bet that I have pain somewhere in my body from the time I wake up until I go to sleep. And pain wakes me up all the time, too. I'm always tired from never resting well.  \n\n\nIn 2012, a stranger came into my house and committed a crime against me so I also have severe PTSD as a result because he was never found. I still live in that house with my husband (53M) and sometimes I cannot even be in the living room where it happened. It's like I relive it.  \n\n\nAs a result of this, I'm on a plethora of narcotic meds, have zero energy, and I'm incredibly depressed.  \n\n\nI pretty much stay in bed most days because the pain is unreal. The meds, even though I don't take them as often as they are prescribed and only once per day, are exhausting. But if I skip them entirely, the pain becomes so hard to manage that I can't even breathe and will wind up throwing up.  I will readily admit that this has affected my ability to care for our house and do stuff for myself the way I used to. My husband works a full-time job. I ask him to bring me drinks before he leaves for work because going down the stairs in the house alone scares me. I've fallen more than once. (I also have Meniere's Disease so I stay pretty dizzy and the meds don't help with that, either.)  \n\n\nAfter 30 years of marriage, my husband is tired of my limitations and inabilities. I'm just as tired of it so I completely understand. It's a crappy way to live and this isn't where I expected to end up. He pulls more than his fair share of the weight in our marriage at this point. I try to push and do things and will wind up throwing up from the pain or needing a wheelchair which upsets him. AITA for wanting to tell him that this is what 'in sickness and health' meant in our vows? I can't help this. It isn't my fault. I don't want to be this way at 49 years old. I hate it. But I can't do what I can't do.", "created_utc": 1697886405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17d04cl/aita_for_wanting_to_remind_my_husband_of_our_vows/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And absolutely you can't help it. However, I still definitely think YWBTA if you approached him like that. His struggles aren't coming from any desire to ignore his vows. Instead, he's just overloaded, and is struggling to cope mentally and/or emotionally anymore. \n\nThis sort of burnout happens routinely to carers. It's just an all-round unfortunate situation, that isn't anyone's fault. So 'reminding' him of his vows would be wrong. It would likely be seen as an attempt to guilt him; suggest he isn't trying hard enough to cope or be a good husband; it also shows no empathy for his emotions, etc. It would likely be seen, as just telling him to just 'suck it up'. \n\nBut he CAN'T just 'pull himself together', anymore than you can. The human brain isn't designed to constantly carry far more than their fair share for years and years (even when it's not your fault, either). Indeed, by guilting him, you would arguably be ignoring the 'sickness and health' vows yourself. Carer emotional health and wellbeing need adequate attention and empathy, or they end up unwell themselves. \n\nInstead, he needs his struggles constructively acknowledged. And some solution that at least reduces the impact (on you both), needs to be found. You need to work together, rather than allow a wedge to be driven between you. For example- can you not move houses? Or would multiple home security cameras potentially help, so you can check nobody has entered the house (when you want to go downstairs)? \n\nIs anything available in your area, to help take pressure off carers/allow them a break (or indeed, is anything available to help support you with your trauma and medical issues)? Have you checked with carer networks, to see if anything is available you weren't aware of? Is therapy any option? Can a cleaner be hired? Can anything more be done to treat your depression?\n\n I'm so sorry you're going through this, but don't turn on each other. Both of you need support and understanding, rather than debate over who isn't living up to their 'obligations'.", "NAH. You have medical needs, clearly that is no one\u2019s fault. But I\u2019m surprised you have stayed in a house that causes you so much distress. Have you considered moving to a single storey home so the stairs are not a problem, might this also relieve your distress from the incident/crime you experienced? \nYour husband is NTA for feeling the full weight of being the care giver and financial provider. Carer burnout is very real.  Can you get any home help to assist you and take the pressure off your husband? Can he get away for a break to refresh and feel better?  Shouting about vows isn\u2019t going to solve any problems. You both need to support each other.", "Yta, you\u2019re thinking of him as your caretaker not as someone you love. \n\nIt sounds like he is at the end of his rope and you guilting him isn\u2019t about him and his feelings, just you. I do feel like if you loved him you would be able to see what he has sacrificed and work to get more supports so he can have a life he enjoys.", "Yes, I know this sucks to hear, YTA.\n\nDo you really think he's not aware after around 11 years of it being this extreme, that this is definitely the \"in sickness part\" of a relationship/marriage?\n\nHe's been there for you, you even admit that he pulls more than his fair share, simply because there's no other option.\n\nAllow him to vent at how unfair life has turned out at times, you're not the only one in pain due to the shitty situation, he could easily halfway into this simply have said \"no more\" and left you, chances are he would have had a better quality of life after getting over the people calling him an asshole.\n\nAll that being said, I really wish you both good luck in a difficult situation.", "YTA- look, what you\u2019re dealing w is awful. To be in that much pain day in and day out, I can\u2019t even imagine.  But you have to realize that it is not just happening to you, you\u2019re husband is dealing with this as well. My husband has multiple medical issues that leave him in chronic pain,  let me tell you this- watching the person that you love be in excruciating pain and not being able to do a damn this about it is agonizing and soul crushing. And we know that as hard as it is for us it is a million times harder for you so we try and be strong and put on a brave face. And on top of that he is working g full time and managing the home. Like I said before, what YOU are going through is awful, but what your husband is going through is awful as well and he is allowed to be exhausted", "Why are you still living in a home that triggers you, could be the target of violent crime, and is actively unsafe for you to go to the kitchen? That doesn\u2019t seem to be great for him either.", "NAH, but also NAH for your husband. I don\u2019t think reminding your him of your vows is going to do more than pushing guilt onto him which can feel manipulative, and might not result in the outcome you think it will. Instead maybe think of what you can say or do to show him he is appreciated regularly. I\u2019m very sorry to hear the amount of pain you are in daily, I genuinely know how hard that is, and I greatly empathize with you. \n\nPs: If RF\u2019s and injections don\u2019t work long term, and if you haven\u2019t considered it yet, see if there is an option for you to trial an occipital spinal cord stimulator for your neuralgia.", "YTA. Basically he is doing everything and his life is miserable, and now you want to guild tripping him.", "I\u2019m not diminishing your pain when I suggest this, because I can relate. There\u2019s a strong link between trauma and storing emotions in the body. Have you sought help for your trauma and do you have a way to express your feelings? \n\nI\u2019m also going to guess you\u2019re peri-menopausal and there is an established link between decreasing estrogen and musculoskeletal pain (even triggering fibromyalgia) so you might want to look at HRT if you are a candidate. \n\nYou may already know that stuff, but if not I just wanted to try to help with your medical issues. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a tough time with your body and your marriage. It\u2019s a crappy situation for both of you. It sucks for everyone. Maybe a therapist can help you guys find a way forward.", "NAH, but most people don\u2019t really give a ton of thought to \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d because they don\u2019t have the foresight ponder what that might really look like. If you\u2019re not getting what you need in the relationship, get a divorce.", "YTA. Come on, everyone knows love is conditional. Unconditional love is only for children and pets.\n\nEveryone has limits on what they\u2019re willing to put up with in a marriage, and that\u2019s okay. A person is not obligated to spend the rest of their life in a marriage that is not working for them.", ">AITA for wanting to tell him that this is what 'in sickness and health' meant in our vows?\n\nYeah. YTA. He knows. He's stayed with piece of meat with eyes for 30 years.  He understands his vows. You don't need to remind him. That would not go over well.", "NAH.\n\nYou need to move and you need a professional carer. This is too much for your husband.", "YWBTA because it sounds like your goal is to give him a guilt trip and make him feel even worse than he already does. \n\nYou can't change the reality of your lives right now unless you move houses or one of you leaves the other. If your husband is understandably burned out by the unexpected turn of your lives, and you drop this \" sickness and health\" shit in his lap it's like you're diminishing the devotion and loyalty he has shown you for so many years. He's holding up his end of the bargain pretty damn well from what you write. Through circumstances out of your control, you aren't. Those feelings are yours to figure out and come to terms with, ideally with a telehealth therapist. \n\nHow terrible would you feel if he held your vows in front of you and told you what you aren't doing to love honor and cherish him, etc etc? Would that 1) change your abilities or 2) make you feel better or worse about your current situation?\n\nWeaponizing your vows may just make him want to throw them all away.", "I\u2019m recently disabled myself (last 2 years) and YTA. Burnout is just that, you\u2019re burnt out. My mom is already burnt out after less than 2 years helping me out and you\u2019re trying to guilt trip the only person helping you, instead of having a proper heart to heart conversation.", "YTA I work as a caregiver I get to clock out and go home decompress so I don\u2019t burn out. Your husband is honoring his Vows he is burnt out and may need some help and a break. Your health issues affect him as well just different.", "Wow, perfec response wish I could have said it so eloquently.", "Upvoting this because it is good advice. And I don't know if I could have said anything better. \n\nNAH for me, unless you try to guilt your husband about your issues.", "This is a compassionate thoughtful answer.", "Yes, he is basically doing everything.  Yes there is the in sickness and in health but there is also the fact that marriage is a partnership.  Unfortunately it might be better if you went into a assisted living facility.  Caregivers burn out a lot and that is just when they are taking care of someone.  The husband also has to work full time, take care of home maintenance, and other household chores.  I don\u2019t know what all OP can do physically.  He might have to step back so he can take care of himself physically and emotionally.", "Also supportive of the suggestion here if moving from a home that brings triggers and limitations with stairs! make life easier and more enjoyable for the both of you!", "Holy shit this is a sociopathic take lmfao", "Same goes for him too then.  He doesn\u2019t have a wife or a partner anymore.  He has been doing this for over 15 years of being the breadwinner, her nurse, her maid etc\u2026.  He is probably not even getting close to what he needs in a relationship.", "She's most definitely a \"YTA\".\n\nIf he weren't aware of the \"in sickness and in health\" he would've left her a long time ago to have a much easier and probably happier life.\n\nHe obviously loves and respects her enough to stand by his vows, allowing him to vent about how unfair \"life has been to them\" (yes them) is the least she can let him do.", "Jfc \u201ca piece of meat with eyes\u201d? You are not qualified to offer anyone advice about anything. She\u2019s been disabled for 15 years, she\u2019s still a human being. \n\nAnd as unfortunate as her husband\u2019s role as caretaker is I am sure he would not trade places with her so he could be in pain 24/7 and feel like a burden at the ripe old age of 49.", "This. It takes a LOT out of the caretaker to pretty much have to take on everything. It's not fair, but humans can only do so much. I don't think your hubby doesn't want to help abd support you, but he's only one man and burning out fast. Please look for outside help.", "It's an honest one that she needs to see/hear.\n\nHer pain and problems are making her blind to the fact that his life is all about ensuring that she'll be as okay as \"possible\" for as long as the situation exists, which is most likely the next 30 years or so.", "But not an inaccurate one.", "Her lack of empathy to her husband burnouts is closer to your accusation than my comment.", "Obviously", "Okay. I stand corrected. 15 years, not 30.   \nThe point is, a lot of people would Nope right out of this situation, because while she's alive, she's not really living. She's a captive in her own body.  \nI'm not saying it's her fault, but 15 years is a long time to be a caretaker for someone so limited. He is taking his wedding vows seriously, and there's no reason to use them as a bludgeon when he shows signs of being worn down. It's insensitive and completely unnecessary.", "Yeah and reminding him of \u201cin sickness and health\u201d would be shitty.  He has been there all theses years.  It seems like OP is so focused on herself that she has no empathy for her husband.  She doesn\u2019t seem to understand that her husband is sick in his heart and worn down.  What OP is going through is horrible but her husband is there too.", "Not at all. It is absolutely mental you think this.", "Tell us you've never dealt with a chronically sick family member without telling us...\n\nMy dad and family went through this for years before my mom passed. Her pain was absolutely real and of course she couldn't help it and didn't want to be that way, but that doesn't negate the 15 years my dad spent of his able bodied life working his ass off and coming home to take care of his wife. He was frustrated, depressed, sad, lonely. If she had gotten upset with him and started going on about vows he would have lost it. \n\nThis entire post is about OPs struggles and whole they are very real, her husband's problems are also real and valid. A marriage is a partnership and clearly he's doing what he can. She absolutely needs to see his side and be more empathetic to him in this situation. She's not the main character here just because she's in pain. \n\nThey need to seek in-home care, and serious respite for the husband. Sickness and health doesn't mean he should be sacrificing 100% of his life to working and caring for his partner.", "I have with my mother. But I get that you think the entire world experiences life the same way you do."]}
