I said \"I'm sorry, I don't even know your name, why would I let you drive my car?\" He kind of looked at me weirdly and says \"I have to get to the grocery store.\" Now, mind you, there was a public bus stopping 2 blocks from our house that went *to the grocery store*, but I guess he was above public transportation? Who knows. So I go, \"Well, the bus stop is down the road, it'll take you right there.\" He just gave me a dirty look and went back upstairs.

It's your personal property and management can't order you to loan it to her, if they tried and after you refused, they retaliated in some way you'd probably have grounds for a lawsuit.
