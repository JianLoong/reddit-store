I've never really talked to Laura before, so I was a bit taken aback by her request. I politely declined, explaining that I don't lend my car to people I don't know well. Laura didn't take it well and started yelling at me, calling me selfish and inconsiderate. She said that she really needed to run these errands and didn't have any other options. I tried to explain to her that I didn't feel comfortable lending out my car to someone I barely knew, but she wouldn't listen. She continued to berate me and even threatened to report me to the apartment complex management. I held my ground and didn't give in, but now I'm wondering if I was in the wrong.

You don't have to lend your car to a stranger, no matter what their address is.\n\nYou might tell apartment management that she was yelling at you for not lending her your car, and ask if other residents have reported similar problems.

That was enough to validate your decision. NTA", "NTA I applaud you actually because that had to take a lot of courage.", "NTA. \n\nHHAHAHAHA, her reaction tells you everything you need to know.  If she wrecks or damages the car, do you think she'd reimburse you?

She better use Uber, Doordash, or Instacart.", "NTA.\n\nI wouldn't lend my car to a good friend, let alone a random neighbor. Laura can call an Uber or Lyft if her errands are so important.

We said hello to the groups living in the other two units, but we weren't friendly with them and didn't hang out together. One day, there was a knock at the door. I answer it and it was one of the upstairs neighbors. He goes \"I need to borrow your car.\" Not \"Hello, how are you\" or anything like that. I said \"I'm sorry, I don't even know your name, why would I let you drive my car?\" He kind of looked at me weirdly and says \"I have to get to the grocery store.\" Now, mind you, there was a public bus stopping 2 blocks from our house that went *to the grocery store*, but I guess he was above public transportation? Who knows. So I go, \"Well, the bus stop is down the road, it'll take you right there.\" He just gave me a dirty look and went back upstairs. For the remaining 2 months we lived t here, the guys wouldn't talk to us and gave us dirty looks. WTF?\n\nDid this guy *really* think I was going to give the keys to my car to a complete and total stranger? People are absolutely delusional.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Can you imagine what it would be like if she got in an accident?! 100% do not. I would actually inform the apartment management about her, and her threats to report you.

Who knows, maybe she\u2019s done this to other people in your apartment complex too.", "Nta she could take an uber", "NTA  Hell no you don't lend your car out to a strange neighbor who thought she could bully you.  Heck there's very few friends I would lend my car to.  You should be approaching your building management and report her for harassment.", "NTA\n\nShe was probably going to go buy drugs or do other shit you wouldn't want your car associated with.  Hell, maybe even sell your car to get a fix.  Someone that asks a stranger to borrow their car and then gets mad when denied is a few crayolas short of a pack.", "LOL what on earth would she report you for? No one can make you lend or give away your possessions without your consent. And you said no in a nicer way than I would have.

I would not let her borrow anything. after that.", ">  She said that she really needed to run these errands and didn't have any other options. \n\nIf she's already got a lifetime ban from every taxi company, Uber, Lyft etc in the area, then I think that's plenty reason not to lend her your car even if you DID know her well... which you don't.\n\nAnd if she doesn't have those lifetime bans, well... she does have other options.\n\nNTA. You should absolutely NOT lend her your car.", "NTA\n\nIf she didn\u2019t have insurance, that could risk your car being seized if she had been stopped by the Police. For all you knew, she might not have a licence to drive, or have a bad driving record.", "Keep some type of security camera or dashcam for your car.", "NTA. Hell, you don\u2019t need to feel obligated to lend your car to people you DO know well. Her need for transportation is NOT your problem. You\u2019re not selfish and have no reason to feel guilty. If something like this comes up again, you can just say that your insurance won\u2019t cover other drivers and it\u2019s out of your hands.\n\nI would definitely report this harassment to your apartment management (via email) in case she harasses you again or in case she goes of the deep end and vandalizes your car. It\u2019s not about retaliation, but just making them aware of the behavior. Also, it\u2019s best to have some sort of record with a third party that this happened.", "Heck no! NTA. Some people I know won't let ANYONE drive their vehicle.", "NTA. Obviously.\n\nReport her to the apartment complex management first. Because they are more likely to side with whoever spoke to them first.", "NTA. Wonder why she couldn\u2019t get an uber.", "NTA and also, why the hell would management care if you refused to loan her your car?  It's your personal property and management can't order you to loan it to her, if they tried and after you refused, they retaliated in some way you'd probably have grounds for a lawsuit.  I would have told her to go ahead and report you because management would probably tell her to get the hell out of their office.", "Nta\n\nWhat would she have reported you for?

Your neighbor is unhinged and harassing their clients. \n\nNTA", "A stranger, with no boundaries, poor judgement, and aggression asked to borrow your car. \n\nEven assuming you can afford a new car, what if she killed someone? \n\nNTA for denying it, you would have to be simple to let her drive it.", "NTA and seriously, \u2018F\u2019 her and her audacity.", "NTA. Depending on your insurance, if she got into an accident the insurance typically follows the car - regardless of the driver. \n\nYou made the right choice, OP.\n\nThe audacity of her to even request such a thing from someone she barely knows is beyond belief.", "NTA - No no no plus if this is USA don't you guys have insurance issues if something happened to the car while she was driving?", "NTA...  Never let anyone borrow your car.  What happens if she totaled?", "First NTA ! Second, no offense, but are you really this much of an easy person to walk all over you ?

Good luck !", "NTA\n\nReally, you would lend out your car to a stranger?  I don't lend my car out to friends nor family.\n\nInsurance follows the car.  If anyone is in an accident driving your car, your insurance pays for it and your rates go up, there is a ding on your credit score.  Don't lend out your car.\n\nThe woman verbally abused you and now you think maybe you should have given in?  I suggest therapy for you, so you can see normal boundaries.", "NTA. She can take public transport or pay a taxi/rideshare. Fucking ridiculous ask from a stranger. You are foolish for even thinking you did the wrong thing and posting on here.", "Anxious to hook up with her drug dealer, maybe.", "NTA. And you do t have to loan your car to someone you do know!", "Thanks for the advice but I'm nervous about reporting her. As you might have got from the post I'm quite nonconfrontational but I'm worried something similar will happen in the future.", " You could probably get this from the post but I don't like confrontation but I'm worried a similar incident will happen if I don't.

And also, it\u2019s not a confrontational thing to advise the apartment manager of what happened. All you need to say is that you wanted to give a heads up that neighbor from \u201cx\u201d apt approached you to borrow your car and when you politely declined they didn\u2019t take it well and she became confrontational.", "You have to report her. She will vandalize your car.", "NTA, and it was smart of you not to just hand over your car to her.", "By NOT addressing the problem now, you're virtually ensuring it gets bigger.\n\nLearning to assert oneself takes practice, but it gets easier with experience, and the more willing you are to assert yourself, the less necessary it becomes. People can tell if you're easy to manipulate. \n\nAs to letting her borrow your car - think about the trouble at your door if she hides drugs in your car, wrecks it, or simply steals it.\n\nThere is a lot of trouble she can cause. Head this off by appropriately alerting people about her behavior.", "NTA, and, of the two, I think you'll be less damned if you just let them know\u2014they need to know so they can see if there is a pattern of her doing this. If she went off on you so easily, I bet you aren't the first."]}
