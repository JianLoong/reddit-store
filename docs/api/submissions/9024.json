More important, you\u2019re a published writer. Why is your husband belittling you?", "If you\u2019ve been published you\u2019re an author. Can people go buy your books? You\u2019re an author. I don\u2019t get why some people are so hung up on things like this.\n\nStart your own Wikipedia page and list yourself as an author on it.

Gosh, it's not a hobby if you're been publishing.\n\n\"You don't do it for a living\"??? Wow. Maybe if a certain husband supported his author spouse, maybe the books will have a bigger audience and will give bigger royalties. Idk.\n\nHe's probably insecure. But that's just my opinion.", "It's not a hobby if you are getting paid and you consider yourself an author.  I think your husband clearly has some insecurities about your success.  In his shoes I would be bragging about you to anyone who would listen.  NTA.", "NTA. People don't always list all their careers when they have multiple just the one they are best known for or most want to be known for. Think of all the actor/model/writer/singer/dancer's there are or people working two jobs because the first one doesn't quite cover all their expenses. You get to pick what you want to list your main career as.", "NTA - you were an author before your first book was published, and it is really troubling that your husband is so unsupportive. He needs to shift his mindset - because it is clearly impacting how you view yourself. Why is he doing this? Is primary financial support his only metric? I am sensing this as a red flag or controlling thing, but not sure if I'm over-interpreting.\n\nMy younger son is a musician and video producer, but his primary income comes from being a producer at our local news station. That is what funds his passion, but what fuels his fire is music and cinematography. I would never introduce him as anything else ... because I support WHO HE IS.", "NTA. So I read the post about the pilot guy. He didn't even have a pilot license let alone actual fly time. He didn't do anything that would be necessary to actually be considered a pilot. Literally just read expensive books and flew virtually. \nYou on the other hand have written 7 whole ass books. That requires so much time and commitment. Most importantly, you finished. On top of that, you had six books published. You've done everything necessary to be considered an author so I say you are one and your husband can get over himself.", "NTA\n\nfirst, yu've been published and paid, that makes it professional.\n\nsecond, *most* authors don't earn enough to make it their full time work.

You always will be an author even if you never write again. The title has nothing to do with whether or not it\u2019s your full-time job.", "NTA, I think the moment you get a book or piece of writing published you\u2019re an author, having done it 6 times over and being well known enough to be at book fairs definitely cements it. Besides that, this isn\u2019t one of those things where a nurse claims to be a doctor or a student claims to be a doctor etc where there could be real consequences to giving someone a title you don\u2019t think they\u2019ve earned. Even if we give your husband the most unbelievable level of benefit of the doubt, and that he truly holds that standard, (which he doesn\u2019t.) there is 0 downside to giving your wife a compliment she may or may not have earned. Couples do that all the time, when my girl wants to butter me up she starts talking about how big and strong I am, is that, strictly speaking 100% true? No I\u2019m not a strong man or anything, but it makes me chortle and that\u2019s enough for her to want to say it. That should be your husband\u2019s feeling, \u201ceven if I genuinely don\u2019t think this is technically true, I want to say it because it\u2019ll make my wife smile.\u201d The fact that he\u2019s not even close to that is a bit alarming.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re an author. I am just getting close to finishing my first book so 7 sounds incredible!! Congrats on your success!\n\nThe average writer makes 10000-20000 dollars a year. Yes, the New York Times best sellers are comfortably living off their book money but a very large chunk of published writers are out here working day jobs because they\u2019re not making enough to pay the bills without it.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd honestly, as a former literary agent, my eyebrows are currently somewhere up in my hairline and I'm seriously side-eyeing your husband because I don't think he understands how any of this works. You are the very realest of the real kind of published author there is, my dear, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself, because what you've accomplished is rare, not easy, and a big deal.\n\nYou need to explain to your husband that with the VERY rare exception of a SMALL HANDFUL of international bestsellers, the vast majority of even the most accomplished authors in this day and age have day jobs. The traditional publishing industry has been hit HARD thanks to everything from Amazon undermining it (long story), the tidal wave that is easy self-publishing (don't even get me started), and the biggest publishers all devouring each other and turning into mega-conglomerates that have destroyed competition. If you're not Stephen King, Margaret Atwood or the like, and already have an established audience of literally MILLIONS, you have a day job, because you CANNOT earn a living just selling books. And most of their money comes from selling TV and movie rights and adaptations.\n\nMy point is, again: you are absolutely, 100% a professional author, the realest of the real. You have been traditionally published, your manuscripts selected by editors at publishing houses, contracts were signed, and your books published, marketed, and distributed in stores. There is absolutely nothing substantive that differentiates you from a Margaret Atwood or a Stephen King other than perhaps sales numbers. One of my dear friends is an acclaimed author whose book was recently shortlisted for one of the top literary awards here in Canada and she has an Etsy shop on the side, LOL. Many of my clients were teachers (I represented mostly children's authors and illustrators), or worked as freelance editors themselves! \n\nYou are NTA for wanting your husband to acknowledge that you are an author, because THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE, by any objective measure. He's just . . . wrong. And you can take that from a longtime former publishing professional.", "NTA. You\u2019re literally a published author who is paid for their books.  You\u2019re clearly an author. You should be proud. A supportive husband would be proud of that. \n\nHow is this even a question for your husband??? It\u2019s not at all like the \u201cpilot\u201d who had never had a flying lesson or ever flown a plane. There are pilots who don\u2019t fly planes for a living, and they are still pilots, but they actually do fly planes.", "NTA for now refusing to say it. On face value I get where he is initially coming from. I refer to my wife as a therapist because that's a current job, not as an actress because that's what she was when she was younger and I always felt that was a side job. But if she asked me to refer to her as that, I would absolutely do that which is what your husband should.\n\nOnce again. I don't think your husband initially did anything wrong. He referred to you as the main job he sees you do everyday. But once you made your request he should have then followed that instead of being dismissive.", "NTA but out of curiosity what\u2019s the genre? Is it something he\u2019s embarrassed about and therefore doesn\u2019t want to mention it?", "Almost all authors do not make enough money to live on. They have a job to provide a roof and food and cover the costs of their writing career. \n\nAs an author of 6 published books, especially as these are published by recognised publishing houses (you get a royalty check from them) and not vanity publishers (where you pay to have the book published) then I would class you as an author.\n\nYour husband should be proud of your success. And it IS a success.\n\nNTA", "Almost no authors make enough to live on solely from their book sales, so ... Your husband can stfu about you not making a living means you're not an author.\n\nYou wrote SEVEN books. That is seriously impressive. That's not just a lil side hobby, that's dedication to your work of BEING AN AUTHOR.", "NTA. If you\u2019re published a book, you\u2019re an author.

I hate this idea that in order be something creative; a musician, an author, a painter, etc. You have to be able to support yourself from that income. \n\nI am a singer and cabaret host. I get paid to do this work (and it is work). Can I support myself solely from this job? No. Does that lessen the value of that work? No. Honestly, even if I didn't get paid, I would still consider myself a singer. \n\nYou have written, published, and been paid for your work. Therefore, you are an author. You are also something else. You are also many other elses. People contain multitudes dammit!", "NTA, it's not a hobby if you're getting paid, it's a second job.

He has done book signings and things like that.  That said, he works in marketing as his career, even if he has made money (not a ton, but some) from writing.  If he started demanding that I refer to him as an author and not what he actually does with his time, I'd probably do it, but would also think he was being a bit overbearing about it.  \n\nSimilarly, I know a guy who on occasion does gigs as a voice actor.

Sorry if I came off too judgmental.  \n\non reddit, of all places...    :)", "To give him the benefit of the doubt, he sounds like maybe a rigid, black and white type thinker(maybe engineer type?), so I can kind of see his logic of answering that way because that is your main source of income. \nHowever, especially in this day and age, lots of people have side hustles, and you is actually really cool and interesting. NTA. \nIt isn\u2019t \u201cjust a hobby\u201d If you get paid for it. It\u2019s a job, and a cool one at that. \n\nWould it be that hard to say, \u201cmy wife is a government employee and writes books as a side gig?\u201d", "Corrected myself in an another reply.  Maybe \u201caspiring full time writer\u201d is another option but that sounds clunky.", "I mean, I\u2019m not saying OP isn\u2019t an author, but being ***published*** these days isn\u2019t as big a deal as you are making it out to be. With the advent of self publishing and other publishing mediums, most anyone can be a published author these days. \n\nDoesn\u2019t mean anyone can be a ***quality*** author, but anyone can be on none the less.", "Ok then she\u2019s a \u201cburgeoning writer\u201d \n\nPoint is she\u2019s not making her living from it yet. So to say she\u2019s a writer when explaining what she does for work or a living wouldn\u2019t be accurate.  \n\nHowever that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t mention it or refuse to mention it like husband is.  She is a writer, she just also works for the government until such a time when she can focus on her writing full time. \n\nI wish her success", "Yea then What you asking for is totally acceptable. Your husband should be proud of your accomplishments.  \n\nNTA", "Exactly this. I\u2019m also a musician, and maybe the top 5% of musicians don\u2019t also have a \u201cday job\u201d. That doesn\u2019t make them any less of a musican. Same with you, OP. You\u2019ve had seven (!) books published that generate income. You are absolutely an author, and congratulations on your success!", "\ud83d\udc9c", "You are 100 % right. I need to be more proud of what I did and still do. I also won one award, and was nominated for three other ones. I often forget that. 30 books is amazing! Good for you! I hope to there at some point.", "It might be different for english publishers, but the norm for french one is 10 %.", "Close, he works in IT security. \ud83e\udd23 Thank you for your comment.", "Quite a few actual canonical authors didn\u2019t make a living out of writing. Daniel Defoe, Henry Fielding, Samuel Richardson, Jane Austen, non of them supported themselves full time through writing. And they were quite successful.", "The awards count. It is also an honor just to be nominated! List your accomplishments. The person whose pride and respect matter most is YOU.", "The next time this comes up tell him that he should respect the fact that you continue to get paid for this so you are in fact an author."]}
