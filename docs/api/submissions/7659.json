We desperately wanted to fight for our son but since initial confrontation he had been avoiding us. We decided we would to take the advice and call the police to press charges. However we wanted to let our son know before doing so.\n\nHusband and I decided to show up at his office since he had been ignoring our calls and texts. I know this might sound boundary crossing to some but we desperately wanted to talk to our son. Initially he got angry and asked us to leave but he calmed down and agreed to hear us out. We told him our side of the story and to say the least, he was SHOCKED. He apologised profusely, cried a little and begged for forgiveness. He told us he was blinded by love, working 14 hours a day and under the impression we had gifted his GF the money.\n\nHis girlfriend had apparently told him that we wanted to spoil her, as our future DIL and that we gave her carte blanche to buy herself nice things as a way to welcome her to the family. And that we\u2019d since changed our minds on spoiling her and now wanted all the money back knowing she can\u2019t afford it. She had told him we did that as a manipulative way to force her out of his life, to try and control him. He was also under the impression she\u2019d spent maybe 3-5 K and not 17 K. He was livid and was actually the one who in the end convinced us to pursue legal action. He actually helped us call the police right then and there at his office after our talk. We then went with him home and helped him pack up all her stuff before she came home. She wasn\u2019t on the lease, living rent free so kicking her out was no issue. We offered to stay with him for the blowup, but he wanted to handle it on his own. From what he\u2019s told me she didn\u2019t take this lightly.\n\nSo our sons EX has now been pressed with charges and we\u2019re awaiting further information. Like some of you pointed out its a sufficient amount and she\u2019s been pressed with criminal charges. Our bank has also been informed and we\u2019re told we\u2019ll likely get our money back. She blew up on the entire family, but no-one but our other DIL is taking her side. Other DIL is a whole story, for another time perhaps but we are now glad to officially announce that we are thief free in the family!!!\n\nWe appreciate all your feedback, advice and engagement.", "created_utc": 1674063207, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fda7s/update_wibta_for_suing_my_dil/", "score": 193, "replies": ["> So our sons EX has now been pressed with charges\n\n#GOOD.", "I'm sorry your son had to find out who his fianc\u00e9e was the hard way - but better that than not at all. All the best moving forward.", "Well, I want to hear about the other DIL. Keep the updates coming :)", "Glad it worked out. Thank you for the update.", "Seems like you saved your money AND your son. If she's already behaving like this, can't imagine what she would do 5-10 years down the line.", "Happy to hear that this didn't irreparably harm the relationship with your son and he heard you out.", "I\u2019m very suspicious about the son still. What\u2019s this about him not knowing? Changing his story? First he said she spent the money because she was stressed? Now he didn\u2019t know the amount? Now he wants to kick her out? Boy knew all along and didn\u2019t care. I wouldn\u2019t give him a free pass so easily. OP, I\u2019m so happy that woman was charged and out. But I\u2019d keep an eye on your son. Because you either have a liar, or an idiot running his own law practice. None are good.", "I'm sorry for what happened, but glad to hear she's now the ex.", "Excellent news.  Of course your son was lied to about the situation.  I was thinking it was so weird that he was a lawyer and blowing off such a massive and blatant illegal choice by his SO to steal that much money from you.\n\nHope you get ALL your money back and she spends some sufficient time behind bars to learn a freaking lesson about all this.", "\ud83d\udc4d good job!", "Wow I'm glad your son came to his senses.  Just imagine if you didn't go to his office to talk to him, he would've been still in the dark to her shenanigans'.\n\nNTA", "Good for you.I am glad you stopped her from doing anything else.For the other DIL, she has no actual reason to justify the others actions.Could you explain about her more and if she starts more problems?", "I\u2019m glad it worked out and she didn\u2019t steal your son too.", "Better to have her Do it now. And be exposed for what she truly is.  Than down the road when she was married to your son with kids.   See it. As a blessing in disguise and know you handled it correctly.    Also good on your son for realizing his mistake and owning up to it.  You did well.", "This is the feel-good post I needed today!", "Excellent - I hope she goes to prison.", "Yay! It's great to see an update like this", "wow that's good to hear and your son dodged a bullet.also why is your other dil taking her side i would love to hear about her too.", "I almost always cringe when people talk about suing family members ( although she\u2019s not one, yet), but in this case you wouldn\u2019t be in the wrong.  The bigger question is will this eliminate your son from your life?  Even if you\u2019re son is in the wrong, it would be hard to not have contact.  A tough situation, sorry you\u2019re dealing with this.\n\nEdit- should have read all of the updated post before commenting, I read the original post, sounds like your son has seen the light, although I\u2019m not sure why he was ok with it when he only thought it was $5000, that\u2019s still a huge problem", "Interesting. I was sure the police would say this is a civil matter but I am in a different country so perhaps we have a different criminal code.", "Good to hear. I'm happy your son listened and understood what she did was 1000000% wrong.", "Willing to bet that other DIL also saw her in laws as cash cows and is now pissed", "Same here!", "Same!", "I feel like once the son saw they were serious about the police he changed his tune.\n\nFrom original post:\n\n\u201cWe've gone to our son and he's offered to pay us back even though he actually cannot afford to.\u201d", "Yes, probably. Or is this made up and a way to introduce the next chapter? I don't know anymore. I don't believe anything on Reddit these days...", "Yeah it's getting worse. \n\nThere are trends as well, I've noticed. One wedding story with someone disinvited or kicked out hits the top posts, there's a dozen more coming through that week.\n\nSame with weird stepsibling inheritance entitlements (saw a few where widowers new spouse wants their kid to get a cut of widowers first in laws' family business etc)\n\nI've posted a couple of times and been told they're non-issues, but hey. They're true.", "I assume most things on Reddit are lies anyway. But I come to AITA for the gossip and drama, so as long as it\u2019s not redundant or totally out of the realm of believability, I don\u2019t mind", "I know. I understand of course that crazy stuff can happen, because I've gone through some pretty unbelievable things myself. But I agree, patterns are starting to show and it's almost impossible to shake the feeling of being taken for a ride.", ">It could be that when someone sees a 'wedding story\" or an \"inheritance story\" here, it inspires another person to post.  \n>  \n>Like when someone is talking to a bunch of friends, and says.  *X happened today and it was weird*.  And a friend says,  *I had something like that happen to me too*.  Neither is made up, it's a way of connecting, or realizing their event has validity too.", "I know, me too", "When post 2 is more farfetched than post 1 and usually includes randoms blowing up their phone at the end, I'm calling BS."]}
