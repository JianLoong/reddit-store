We desperately wanted to fight for our son but since initial confrontation he had been avoiding us. We decided we would to take the advice and call the police to press charges. However we wanted to let our son know before doing so.\n\nHusband and I decided to show up at his office since he had been ignoring our calls and texts. I know this might sound boundary crossing to some but we desperately wanted to talk to our son. Initially he got angry and asked us to leave but he calmed down and agreed to hear us out. We told him our side of the story and to say the least, he was SHOCKED. He apologised profusely, cried a little and begged for forgiveness. He told us he was blinded by love, working 14 hours a day and under the impression we had gifted his GF the money.\n\nHis girlfriend had apparently told him that we wanted to spoil her, as our future DIL and that we gave her carte blanche to buy herself nice things as a way to welcome her to the family. And that we\u2019d since changed our minds on spoiling her and now wanted all the money back knowing she can\u2019t afford it. She had told him we did that as a manipulative way to force her out of his life, to try and control him. He was also under the impression she\u2019d spent maybe 3-5 K and not 17 K. He was livid and was actually the one who in the end convinced us to pursue legal action. He actually helped us call the police right then and there at his office after our talk. We then went with him home and helped him pack up all her stuff before she came home. She wasn\u2019t on the lease, living rent free so kicking her out was no issue. We offered to stay with him for the blowup, but he wanted to handle it on his own. From what he\u2019s told me she didn\u2019t take this lightly.\n\nSo our sons EX has now been pressed with charges and we\u2019re awaiting further information. Like some of you pointed out its a sufficient amount and she\u2019s been pressed with criminal charges. Our bank has also been informed and we\u2019re told we\u2019ll likely get our money back. She blew up on the entire family, but no-one but our other DIL is taking her side. Other DIL is a whole story, for another time perhaps but we are now glad to officially announce that we are thief free in the family!!!\n\nWe appreciate all your feedback, advice and engagement.", "created_utc": 1674063207, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fda7s/update_wibta_for_suing_my_dil/", "score": 4612, "replies": ["> So our sons EX has now been pressed with charges\n\n#GOOD.", "I'm sorry your son had to find out who his fianc\u00e9e was the hard way - but better that than not at all.

If she's already behaving like this, can't imagine what she would do 5-10 years down the line.", "Happy to hear that this didn't irreparably harm the relationship with your son and he heard you out.", "I\u2019m very suspicious about the son still. What\u2019s this about him not knowing? Changing his story? First he said she spent the money because she was stressed? Now he didn\u2019t know the amount? Now he wants to kick her out? Boy knew all along and didn\u2019t care. I wouldn\u2019t give him a free pass so easily. OP, I\u2019m so happy that woman was charged and out. But I\u2019d keep an eye on your son. Because you either have a liar, or an idiot running his own law practice. None are good.", "I'm sorry for what happened, but glad to hear she's now the ex.", "Excellent news.  Of course your son was lied to about the situation.  I was thinking it was so weird that he was a lawyer and blowing off such a massive and blatant illegal choice by his SO to steal that much money from you.\n\nHope you get ALL your money back and she spends some sufficient time behind bars to learn a freaking lesson about all this.", "\ud83d\udc4d good job!", "Wow I'm glad your son came to his senses.  Just imagine if you didn't go to his office to talk to him, he would've been still in the dark to her shenanigans'.\n\nNTA", "Good for you.I am glad you stopped her from doing anything else.For the other DIL, she has no actual reason to justify the others actions.Could you explain about her more and if she starts more problems?", "I\u2019m glad it worked out and she didn\u2019t steal your son too.", "Better to have her Do it now. And be exposed for what she truly is.  Than down the road when she was married to your son with kids.   See it. As a blessing in disguise and know you handled it correctly.    Also good on your son for realizing his mistake and owning up to it.  You did well.", "This is the feel-good post I needed today!", "Excellent - I hope she goes to prison.", "Yay! It's great to see an update like this", "wow that's good to hear and your son dodged a bullet.also why is your other dil taking her side i would love to hear about her too.", "I almost always cringe when people talk about suing family members ( although she\u2019s not one, yet), but in this case you wouldn\u2019t be in the wrong.  The bigger question is will this eliminate your son from your life?  Even if you\u2019re son is in the wrong, it would be hard to not have contact.  A tough situation, sorry you\u2019re dealing with this.\n\nEdit- should have read all of the updated post before commenting, I read the original post, sounds like your son has seen the light, although I\u2019m not sure why he was ok with it when he only thought it was $5000, that\u2019s still a huge problem", "Interesting. I was sure the police would say this is a civil matter but I am in a different country so perhaps we have a different criminal code.", "Good to hear. I'm happy your son listened and understood what she did was 1000000% wrong.", "Willing to bet that other DIL also saw her in laws as cash cows and is now pissed", "Same here!", "Same!", "I feel like once the son saw they were serious about the police he changed his tune.\n\nFrom original post:\n\n\u201cWe've gone to our son and he's offered to pay us back even though he actually cannot afford to.\u201d", "Yes, probably. Or is this made up and a way to introduce the next chapter? I don't know anymore. I don't believe anything on Reddit these days...", "Yeah it's getting worse. \n\nThere are trends as well, I've noticed. One wedding story with someone disinvited or kicked out hits the top posts, there's a dozen more coming through that week.\n\nSame with weird stepsibling inheritance entitlements (saw a few where widowers new spouse wants their kid to get a cut of widowers first in laws' family business etc)\n\nI've posted a couple of times and been told they're non-issues, but hey. They're true.", "I assume most things on Reddit are lies anyway. But I come to AITA for the gossip and drama, so as long as it\u2019s not redundant or totally out of the realm of believability, I don\u2019t mind", "I know. I understand of course that crazy stuff can happen, because I've gone through some pretty unbelievable things myself. But I agree, patterns are starting to show and it's almost impossible to shake the feeling of being taken for a ride.", ">It could be that when someone sees a 'wedding story\" or an \"inheritance story\" here, it inspires another person to post.  \n>  \n>Like when someone is talking to a bunch of friends, and says.  *X happened today and it was weird*.  And a friend says,  *I had something like that happen to me too*.  Neither is made up, it's a way of connecting, or realizing their event has validity too.", "I know, me too", "When post 2 is more farfetched than post 1 and usually includes randoms blowing up their phone at the end, I'm calling BS.", "> His girlfriend had apparently told him that we wanted to spoil her, as our future DIL and that we gave her carte blanche to buy herself nice things as a way to welcome her to the family. \n\nWooooooowwwwww", "I know of someone who served 5 years in prison for using $550 on a credit card that was not theirs. DIL might (rightly) be facing some serious consequences. I am shocked she spent so goddamned much. I don't condone stealing on ANY level, but that is an unfathomable amount on her part. Absolutely disgusting. \n\nDefinitely NTA and I sincerely hope you're able to recover that money. She is appalling.", "When people are caught stealing and then they act like they are the victim my desire for justice increases exponentially.\n\nThank for the update!", "So your son believed you were allowing his girlfriend to spend thousands of dollars of your money on herself, and he never said anything about it to you? Not one mention? Not a, \"Wow, that's way too generous.\" Or even a \"Thank you.\" Just never discussed it with you at all?\n\nHmmm.", ">She wasn\u2019t on the lease, living rent free so kicking her out was no issue.\n\nFYI; neither of these things matter for establishing tenancy. If she was willing to make an issue about it, given the information we have she would absolutely win a lawsuit for wrongful eviction.\n\nNot very likely she would try, but something to keep in the back of your mind.", "> She wasn\u2019t on the lease, living rent free so kicking her out was no issue.\n\nWhere do you live that tenants have zero rights and can be evicted with zero notice? I hope your lawyer son isn't opening himself up to legal ramifications here.", "If this is in the United States I think the manner of kicking DiL out of the residence she shared with the son might constitute an illegal eviction.", "This is such a good update. It\u2019s awful that this has happened to your family but it is such good news that DIL showed her true colours and your son hasn\u2019t been sucked in to the point he took her side.\n\nIt will be hard for your son but he has had a very lucky escape before their lives were inextricably linked. \n\nGood luck to you all!", "sounds like your son ended up being grateful to get away from such a manipulative spouse\n\nThe theft charges also help him the divorce and he'll likely be able to walk away fairly painlessly", "Please keep us posted with future updates!", "Even if you don't get the money back, consider it a relatively cheap way to get a trash person out of your and your son's life.", "Y\u2019all gotta go back and figure out what happened when they were learning how to pick partners. Something went wonky there, lol", "Yeah\u2026 yikes. Better now than later but it makes wonder how much she\u2019s racked up in CC bills tied to your sons name. Sounds like she was just hoping for a sugar daddy lawyer.", "Very pleased to hear this!!!", "I'm so glad that your son took the time to hear you out and has removed that woman from his life. Good job, all around.", "Good update although I find it hard to believe that your son didn\u2019t know how much she stole from you plus I thought you told him, well I am glad justice wS found.", "Whew. I might be the only one who feels this way, but the best part of your update is that your relationship with  your son is still good. Whether or not you get your money back, he's safe from her and your relationship with him is still strong.", "Happy ending", ">She blew up on the entire family, but no-one but our other DIL is taking her side. Other DIL is a whole story, for another time perhaps\n\nLooks like your kids have some pretty bad taste in SOs.", "Thank goodness you got that thief out of your lives... imagine what she would have done to your son (and his livelihood) if she kept up with this? I'm glad he saw reason, and you still have a good relationship with him. People like her don't stop until they are stopped, so thank you for being the person to stop her from preying on other people.", "Thank you, too many people let this stuff slide because \"it's too much hassle\" and then the thief does it to someone else and that person ends up in a state where they can't solve it and loses more.", "Great otucome! Happy for you because you were able to reconcile with your son.", "Overjoyed to hear this! I'm glad your son saw reason and you didn't lose him \u2764\ufe0f", "Color me shocked she told your son a completely different story. I\u2019m glad he heard you out and that DIL is now an ex. What a rotten human.", ">She wasn\u2019t on the lease, living rent free so kicking her out was no issue. \n\nThis is probably incorrect - if she had established tenancy then this is an illegal eviction.", "My guess (pure speculation) is GF got to son first and spun this elaborate story in case it blew up in her face.  My guess, she had laid the groundwork for a while. \n\nFacts: Parents had enough money to loan the son money to start his own law firm at 25/26.  That\u2019s not cheap (office, insurance, other indirect expenses, etc).  Mom didn\u2019t notice $17,000 leaving her account.  That leads me to believe they have significantly more money than most. Likely talking upper class. \n\nTypically in the US - you graduate undergrad at 21, plus 3 years of law school so done by 24. Then you need to pass the bar, 6 months - 1 year. So he basically graduated law school, passed the bar, and wanted to start his own law firm.  That\u2019s ambitious even for connected established people.  Going out on a limb that he has enough family cushion that failing wouldn\u2019t be disastrous like it would for the average person. \n\nIf the son feels guilty for his wealthy upbringing - conscious or not, it wouldn\u2019t be hard for someone to capitalize on that.  Enter GF who spins a story of \u2018parents won\u2019t accept me\u2019 and \u2018woo is me, your parents hate me, I grew up with nothing\u2019 behind the scenes because she\u2019s not on the same step of the social ladder - the son would automatically be more defensive of her. Thus far, he loves her and has no reason to doubt what she says.  If anything parents doing that might reinforce what GF says behind closed doors. So it further validates what GF says.  GF convinces son to cut contact due to how she is treated so he never hears their full story with proof. \n\nSo many books and movies have been written about these troupes because it actually happens more often than we care to admit.  There are two here - the gold digging SO who plots behind the scenes to separate a person from the family and the waspy parents who sabotage a love interest because they aren\u2019t of the same social standing.", "I'm guessing it's because this story is fiction. \n\nToo many contradicts, coupled with the fact that the son never even discussed what his parents were supposedly doing (according to the GF). Real people would have at least mentioned it to their parents, either to tell them it's not neccessary or to thank them for being so generous.", "If he's working 14 hour days while she lives off him free and has been trying to cause a wedge between him and his parents (whom she's stealing from), I can see him not knowing. He wants to come home and have peace, and he doesn't know what she's doing since he's barely home, and he hears her side first and probably thinks his parents are making his life harder when he's tired and just wants to come home and sleep and have time with his fiance.\n\nOnce he heard the amount and his parents side, I'm glad he woke up. Especially considering a thief for a wife around his accounts could ruin everything he worked for for YEARS. She needs a record so anyone she dates in the future who does a background check is warned. \n\nBut the fact that he didn't want his parents around to witness the fight MAY be because he knew she was charging (and didn't want his parents to know he knew) and was shocked she lied about the amount.", "And to find out she was working to put a wedge between him and his parents. What a malicious person.", "Sure, but when you're facing charges for a class D felony aka up to 7 years/10k fine I don't think you'll have time to worry about it. Plus laws vary a lot, not sure if the theft would be grounds for eviction or not.", "Over $500 is considered Grand Theft and one generally serves time for such a charge in the US, I believe.", "This is what I'm thinking too, if she DEFENDED her STEALING $17k. WOW!!!", "No one graduates law school  and immediately starts their own practice even after practicing for 1-2 years, it's incredibly stupid. There is also the fact that even though she wasn't on the lease she still has legal rights and we are supposed to believe that this lawyer just kicks her out. Like I can get over the parents not knowing that pressing charges is a myth but maybe the son is a moron and that's why he's starting a private practice at 26 and just kicks her out.", "It can very well be fiction. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised. But I know rich people like OP and husband who give free passes to their idiot kids so it can also be true. The only reason why it\u2019s probably fake is that rich people like them don\u2019t come to AITA.", "Also, it doesn't matter if someone is on a lease, or not paying rent.  You still have to legally evict them. You can't throw them on the street with no notice.  Of course, GF may not know this so she may have just left, but it always amuses me when people think that they can make someone immediately homeless just because they aren't on a written lease.  That's just not how it works.", "Here if you have ever provided someone access to your account such as giving your PIN number, it\u2019s not a criminal offence if they continue to use it.\nYou would have to sue", "Class D felony theft is $750-$25000 and carries up to 7 years and a 10k fine.", "> I don't believe anything on Reddit these days...\n\nThe store finally had 3-way light bulbs in stock today.  You can believe that.", "I agree. This story never added up for me. They're wealthy and aloof enough to NOT NOTICE $17,000 missing for months, but they take to Reddit to ask how they should proceed? Honestly makes no sense.", "If he's paying for everything, she has no evidence she ever lived there.", "Saaame. Its miserable when you're the one involved with the drama, but other people's can be some fantastic entertainment", "It\u2019s crazy how much time I can spend in one AITA thread just reading all the comments. Very entertaining!", "Not taking Ex gf side at all, but I feel like a piece of mail in her name to that address is all the proof she would need ? \n  \nSomething does seem fishy tho. The whole thing is probably fake LOL", "If they all \"just happened\" that makes me suspicious too. Seeing a post on a topic and being reminded of a similar incident in the past makes sense to me. Not five events with similar circumstances all occurring in the past month.", "Or when post 2 tries to be identical in every way except for a gender switch. You know there\u2019s somebody out there standing in front of a mirror practicing their ah-HAH\u2019s.", "This sounds like a bunch of nonsense honestly. How did your son not notice 17k worth of purchases? He thought you guys just gave her freedom with your card and never thanked you or asked you about it? Is this something you have ever done in the past? Giving your card to someone for unlimited purchases? Why would he not question that? \n\nSeems like he knew exactly what was happening and sank her under the bus as soon as he realized the seriousness of everything.", "I'm wondering what she was buying that would add up to $17,000.  Was she buying and reselling stuff?  Does she have a drug problem? Was the son in on it??  This behavior was just too over the top to be normal.  Call the cops!", "Hey on the bright side - she won\u2019t have to pay rent in jail either!", "Really glad your entire family is United on this and you are pressing charges. Also glad you found out now rather than after things went further between them.\n\nBest of luck and I hope you get your money back", "WOWZA!!  I'm so glad it's working out, and it sounds like your son dodged a HUGE bullet!", "Glad to hear your son backed you 100% in what his thieving ex-gf did.  And she absolutely deserved criminal charges for stealing 17K dollars.", "I'm so happy your son got the full story and is now taking the matter seriously.  When I read your first story and you commented he was an attorney, I was really concerned about his response.  As any good lawyer (even ones just starting out) would be very concerned about such behavior and wouldn't take it lightly.", "So glad your son was informed of the truth too. Your other DIL another AH", "Thank goodness your son was just misinformed he could have torpedoed this relationship with and his entire career he's been killing himself to build if he didn't listen. So glad this had a good outcome and its very good he helped report it as it could have had bearing on his standing as a lawyer down the line. \n\nI hope she gets what's coming to her and y'all get the money back or as much as possible, what a crazy woman.", "This was for the best.\n\nImagine they had gotten married? Had kids together? If she wasn\u2019t remorseful was spiteful, and lied now, yikes to the future. Thank goodness your son realized that.", "Saved your son a huge headache down the road.", "Bollocks. If your son believed you had given her a  card to use for anything and everything he would have mentioned it in conversation with you. I would be very very careful around him and money.", "Good update, I wanna hear how this ends for her.", "What a positive update and a good ending. \n\nBut the other DIL, oh Reddit friend, bring it to us. Inquiring minds want to know\u2026", "this was very satisfactory to read.", "How do you get your money back if it was spent? Like where does it come from? If she bought a burger the resources to make that burger have been used and can\u2019t be returned right?", "We need more boomers on reddit.", "...and then everybody clapped?\n\nCome on.", ">thief-free\n\nThe only way to be. I'm sorry it happened but glad you were able to get thru to your son", "Yikes.\n\nI'm so happy for that this ended about as well as it could have! You have your son, he hasn't been poisoned against you, and hopefully he'll be a little more careful about choosing partners in the future.\n\nThank goodness!", "So glad son has opened his eyes and kicked the criminal out. I hope she is convicted and learns a big lesson.", "\u201cSo our sons EX has now been pressed with charges\u201c\n\nAMAZING", "Hate to break it to you but you still illegally evicted her, even without a lease or rent payments. And your lawyer son should know that.", "Right? I've never met any family THAT welcoming!", "Do you think she would want to take a lawyer to court for damages, considering he would likely counter sue and win?", "No BUT just proved she was kinda gold digging.", "Thief DIL probably bragged to DIL #2 and bought her stuff off the \u201cfree\u201d card", "I'm not sure the original post even said his age, only hers.

What other reason is there to end on a cliffhanger when the story has already concluded?

Chiiiillllll... Because they're all lies and they're all true. It's Schr\u00f6dinger's stories.\n\nAnd the only way to treat the cat is to not care either way. Nice story. Cool.", "Unless you have a ton of money to fall back on and family connections to pull people in.  That\u2019s the only way I can see that working but the kicking her out is fishy.

Most government offices require proof of residency and some, like Human Services, often has a way to verify this either by driving directly to the address listed(Livingston County, New York does this) or by sending a letter to the landlord/property manager requesting confirmation of residency. DMV wants bank statement or other official mail from government offices or a copy of the lease with your name on it(At least here in North Dakota).\n\nPoint is, I can have mail sent, like a bill, to any address in the USA.
