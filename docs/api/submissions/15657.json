Said 31 year old man has a 29 year old sister who lives about 20 minutes away.\nShe lived with us in the past for a year (paid no bills, bought no groceries, didn't watch the kids, was very inconsiderate and very ungrateful). She has been living on her own since September of 2021 but still has come over to our house to do her laundry and wash her car amongst other things. Last night me and my husband were talking about our new washer and dryer delivery for later this week. I told him \"while we on the subject, I'd like to talk to you about something\", I proceeded to explain to him that when we get the new washer and dryer I do not want his sister washing clothes at our house. I explained that the last two times she has come over, there has been a discussion about her doing laundry at our house in my presence without anyone even asking me for my opinion or permission on the matter. This has been a problem for me for a while now but I have no spoken up until last night because I know he is very protective over them. Long story short he called me selfish and said that he doesn't agree that she should be able to do her laundry at our house and that I shouldn't do tit for tat and \"two wrongs don't make it right\". His sister does not do anything for us, we asked her once last year to watch the kids (Friday & Saturday for 3-4 hours) so I could go back to work. The nanny was not able to do those days so we asked her, two weeks in she texted him asking when were we gonna find someone else to watch the kids because she wanted to join a gym and do yoga, I had to quit that job because we couldn't find another nanny to do it. I haven't really talked to her much since then (approx July 2022) but she comes over just about every weekend.\nMy point to him was why is she allowed to come to our house and run our bills up when every time we need her, she can never come through. She is a very entitled individual who expects things but can never help anyone else in return. I am fed up because its been going on for far to long so I am planning to file for divorce.\nAITA for not wanting her to continue to run our bills up?\nI am so exhausted you guys...", "created_utc": 1682433464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ylaoo/aita_for_not_wanting_his_sister_doing_her_laundry/", "score": 244, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not the laundry. And it's not the childcare. It's the fact that SIL took a lot out of your family, and she did it with an air of entitlement, and with no reciprocation.  In fact, it's just getting worse because she is still invading your family's space and using your family's resources and you had no say in what happened in your own home. Your husband has put her feelings over yours. I bet you feel like it's always you that has to give - Your privacy, your car, your job, your husband's support/loyalty. I get it. I hope you can find a way to be at peace.", "Well thanks everyone for your comments whether you think I'm the asshole or not.\n\nI have decided that I will be filing for divorce because I am honestly just tired and fed up.\n\nThere's bigger issues than the laundry.\nBut to add in for clarification, she has this issue everywhere she goes. She has been kicked out of her grandfather's house, her mom's house and her father's place. I am not trying to drive a wedge in between him and his sister. She is literally the one who drives the wedges. She was causing issue between her grandfather and his wife, she caused issue between her mother and her husband, and she caused issue between her father and his girlfriend. She ended up in our house because she had nowhere else to go after her mother kicked her out in 2020.\n\nSo maybe I am the asshole, Idk but this is not how I want to live the rest of my life..coddling and providing for someone else's 30 year old child.", "Looking at your previous post you are justified. If this was his mother doing this everyone would say NTA and to 2 card him. He is putting his sisters wants and needs before his family. You are NTA. Entitled sister needs to find a laundromat but I guess the laundromats don\u2019t feed you or give you money to pay your bills.", "NTA. Your SIL is a parasite, and you are under no obligation to let her take advantage of you and your husband. So ban her from using your stuf, she can get her own washer.

Otherwise the mods will remove your post faster than you can say the word \"asshole\"", "Sounds like she was a freeloader, moved and still ... give her the old washer and dryer.", "NTA - its your privacy !!", "NTA. \n\nClearly this isn\u2019t about the laundry, but about your home and family time being consistently invaded by an inconsiderate person. \n\nYour husband is not setting appropriate boundaries with his sibling and it\u2019s crossing too many lines for you over a long period of time. \n\nAt this stage of your life, it\u2019s perfectly normal to want your own space in our own home with your own family, particularly on weekends. It seems your husband disagrees, or isn\u2019t prepared to do this, and it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not accept to live like this. Good luck with your own life.", "NTA relationships have give and take, if you're living rent free you help out, doing chores, babysitting every now and then, that's not unreasonable.\n\nIt sounds like you've checked out of your marriage because you're not getting the support you should be \n\nGood luck OP", "If you\u2019re already considering divorce, you have bigger problems in your marriage and are trying to pin it on someone else.

No. But most people would want to return a favor when someone helped them that much.", "OK, listen: You're obviously under a lot of pressure, and I'm NOT going to call you an AH. But really, the laundry thing doesn't seem like that big a deal to me. I mean, as an adult, I've always lived in apartments/condos. Not all of them had laundry rooms. So it was almost a joke that ... into my 30s ...whenever I visited my parents, I'd do a load of laundry. I think this is a pretty common experience. \n\nOf course it's your house and of course you have the right to say to someone, \"You can't do laundry here.\" And I get that that you feel like you're always giving, and your SIL is always taking. But really, your ask that she babysit every Friday and Saturday for 3-4 hours so you could go to work was a HUGE one. Much bigger than the ask that someone do her laundry at your house. I totally get why your SIL wasn't up for it long term. \n\nI can't believe that these issues alone are leading to you wanting to divorce your husband, and break up a family with children. I hope you find a way to manage the laundry situation, but it seems like there must be other stuff you and your husband have to work on. Best of luck to you.", "NTA I would hate that, and from reading your other post, she sounds very immature and entitled.", "NTA - The fact that she has come to your house to do laundry for almost a year and you\u2019ve barely spoken says she isn\u2019t thanking you or showing any gratitude or appreciation. She sounds extremely selfish. But in all fairness do you want someone like that watching your kids anyway?! It\u2019s your house as much as it is her bros but IMO this is between you and hubby and him lacking boundaries that support you, your marriage and home. Obviously this isn\u2019t your only bone of contention so therapy would be my first suggestion. If that\u2019s not an option and you don\u2019t mind her watching your kids suggest an exchange - laundry for her time. Like, sure, you can do laundry every ____ and while you\u2019re here we\u2019d like for you to watch them during that time. Then use that time to do what you need/want. Or just start turning off the water and hide the laundry soap! /s\n\nI can\u2019t believe all the comments supporting her freeloading - seems very entitled. Sorry OP. Frustrating for sure.", "NTA\n\nYour house is not a laundromat.

If anything your doing your husband a favour because it looks like divorce was always inevitable \n\nI guarantee if this was vice versa your husband would have no issues letting one of your siblings do laundry or anything equivalent, especially since you went of your way to be nice to his for the last couple years (which turned out to be fake love)", "NTA.  She's a grown-ass woman and there are such things as laundromats if she can't afford her own washer/dryer.  I'd be super annoyed too!

But if we\u2019re even *considering* divorce over this\u2026 like imagine explaining to somebody that you divorced your husband over someone else\u2019s laundry.

If you honestly cannot for the life of you try to get along with her then probably get a divorce bc this is his sister, you\u2019re not going to win that \u201cit\u2019s me or her\u201d fight.
