They didn't really need to confront you like that.\n\nBtw, sometimes kids get into private schools based on scholarships, generous relatives, or their parents scraping up all disposable income.

And it isn't just the movie ticket.  All the other siblings will also want soda, popcorn and candy.  So you've put some parents in a position where they are forced to spend money to not look like the asshole.  \n\nI'm going to go with a light NTA, but I don't think you considered the impact this \"treat\" would have.", "Soft YTA - I grew up poor. I didn\u2019t go to a movie at all until I was 7. We went to maybe one a year. As a teenager I had to use my babysitting money for movies. This would have been a huge burden for my family. Especially with the free pop and popcorn because we never got treats like that ever. So, if other siblings were involved they would have begged for things we couldn\u2019t afford. Realistically my mother probably would have taken me, got my grandparents to babysit my siblings, then told me to lie to not upset my siblings. I would have been 5 and messed up then there would have been resentment. \n\nI also really don\u2019t like the comments on how all parents take their children to movies. They really don\u2019t. It is like such a large indicator of how your privileged and don\u2019t know it. Unless your kid goes to an expensive private school with no scholarships you put someone in an awkward situation.

Obviously I think they were out of line, there's no question about that so I won't waste time discussing that.\n\nBut unless these kids are old enough to attend movies without an adult, you've created an obligation, not given a gift. Kids that young don't cost a lot to take to the movies individually, so the adult ticket to accompany the kid might cost them more than your gift was worth in the first place. Nevermind if they have to bring along other kids for logistical reasons (no free childcare available) and end up feeling they should get their other kids food at movie theater prices to be fair and not have to listen tk the other kids whining and fighting during the movie. Or the nightmare of the logistics of herding a bunch of little kids into the movies just being an exhausting pain in the ass.\n\nIt's also a problem that you handed it out to the kids, so if the parent doesn't take them to the movies, they're the ones framed as the bad guy because the kids had the whole day to get excited about it.\n\nThis would be a sick gift for 12 year olds, it's a terrible gift for 5 year olds who.\n\nAnd while obviously it's valid to want to take kids to the movies, do keep in mind how expensive the activity could ultimately be for an experience the kid probably won't remember at that age, when they could comfortably just rent the movie from home and the kid will enjoy the movie just as much.", "Qqaaaaq\u00d7pp8ppl7l794jko ppllllppppppp]PPPPPPOO8aa7y 7pm you up 8 up\u2070", "This is the comment right here.

Whoever sees a problem with this can ignore the gift and move on.", "Or...shocking suggestion...just take some time to take that one kid to the movies, I still remember the time my Dad took me to a showing of 101 Dalmatians, just me and him!

Sometimes one of us got something that the other didn\u2019t and while we probably whined about it to our parents, we eventually got over it. Sometimes it meant quality time with just one parent while the other was taking my sister somewhere.\n\nSome of the responses here act as though kids shouldn\u2019t have to handle any kind of disappointment (if the parent were to just ignore the coupon) or that putting a parent in the position of having to say \u201cno thanks\u201d is unreasonable.  \n\nI agree with everyone else that thinks most kindergartners will focus on the candy. And one of my dad\u2019s favorite stories from when we were really little was when someone gave us a gift certificate to Chuck E Cheese, and not wanting to deal with the annoyance of taking us, told us it was a \u201clibrary card\u201d \ud83d\ude02 and gave it away. \n\nIt was a nice gesture, OP.

How dare you!\"", "I think most parents take their kids to movies don't they?  When I rent out a theater and let my kids invite their friend I usually fill it up. These three women in particular I know have brought their entire families. I did an event for the League of Superpets and we had a couple of hundred clients and kids.", "Yeah, I agree with this. I don't think OP is obligated to get movie tickets for everyone's entire family, but if the kids aren't old enough to go to a movie alone or with each other, then the parent has to spend money to use the movie... a movie, popcorn, and drink for the price of just the adult ticket is a good deal... unless you don't have it in the budget (or time and energy!) to go to a movie regardless. Nevermind if there are other kids involved who will have to be brought along due to logistics (can't leave a kid alone while the parent is at the movies!) or due to perceived fair treatment of multiple kids to bring the cost up.

Maybe they bought the house and cars, and then someone lost a job.  Maybe they are scraping to get by until new employment comes.  Maybe they've had health problems that have drained their safety net.  Maybe they are taking care of parents.  Maybe they had lots of money invested in Facebook/Meta and are terrified that their life savings is disappearing.  Maybe they have a business that is failing, or maybe one of them got addicted to coke, hookers and gambling.  There are many things that can happen to financially secure people to make them no longer financially secure.  \n\nAnd in all of these cases, they may be trying to keep up a front that everything is fine.

It's not like they can ask for more time to do this or for OP to turn back the clock. With the added cost and time commitment, all they can do at this point is recoup the cost by getting more vouchers, so I can see why they might focus on it. TO BE CLEAR, I'm not saying those parents are in the right! I think they're being rude and way overstepping asking for more vouchers. My point is just that you can't assume none of these parents are annoyed about the hassle of going to the movies. Hell, this is just the three parents that started shit. Who knows if any of the other parents of the other 14 kids are privately annoyed about this, but not going to say anything out of politeness.  \n\nThe issue is not if those three parents were rude or not. The question was if OP \"may be the asshole because (they) didn't take into consideration the amount of money and time people would have to spend to claim the ticket.\" Which, again, I think is true. OP didn't consider the time and money this could cost the other parents, who may be understandably annoyed at this gift.

Surely all the parents were eventually planning to have their kids see a movie at some point over the course of them being young enough to use a child\u2019s pass. Just save it for that time. Nobody is forcing them to use it ASAP. I would be thrilled with a free movie and snacks pass.

Usually parents trying to not give their kids a ton of fast food, who then have to deal with even more protests and arguments from their kid about it.

They get over it.", "WTF? No. If they have hardships, they can drop their kid off with the friends who also got vouchers. \n\nSee that? No expense to the families. It\u2019s complete and utter bull that this woman did anything wrong.", "My mom had financial hardships most of my childhood and would still have used the coupon for me. She would have left my siblings with family and taken me to a matinee and snuck her own popcorn in in her purse. She tried to teach us that we all can\u2019t always have or do the same things. Think about it, is it \u201cfair\u201d when one kid gets invited to a super cool bday party and not their siblings? No. But you also wouldn\u2019t keep the kid who got the invite from going. \n\nPersonally, I can afford to take my kids to the movie but I would probably use the coupon as an opportunity to send one on one time with my kid or make a fun event out of it for all of us. \n\nOP - NTA.

A) Make time and spend $$$ taking all the kids to the movies. B) Make time and take just that one kid to the movies, still spend $ on your own ticket, have to deal with explaining to your other kids why they're not going, and potentially pay $$$ to hire a babysitter if you're a single parent.
