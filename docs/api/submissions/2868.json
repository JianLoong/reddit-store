My MIL is extremely dependent on her son (my husband, she literally will scan every mail document and make my husband translate it). My MIL has no concept of the law here, does not know how to pay bills, doesn\u2019t speak English. \n\nAnyways, she (prior widow) recently got divorced (2 year marriage) from her second husband. She decided to \u201csue\u201d her ex husband to teach him a lesson in divorce settlement. We all told her to please not do it. Me, my husband, my mother (who is her friend), etc. She decided she can handle this, hired some lawyer off the chinese news paper, and it was a disaster. Nothing was listed correctly, bunch of pre-martial asset was counted as marital asset and bunch of marital asset was counted as her ex husband\u2019s pre martial asset. Anyways. She really screwed up, her lawyer also screwed up. She had no idea to even review the documents despite she specifically found a chinese speaking lawyer. So instead of getting her ex-husband to pay her, she now owes her ex husband 70k. SHe didn\u2019t tell us until near the end, no one had a chance to review the documents.\n\nShe does not have that much cash and is asking me to lend her 50k. I asked for a promissory note prior to doing so. \n\nHere is why she and my husband thinks I\u2019m an AH (and maybe I am). Back in our mid 20\u2019s, we were looking at buying a townhome. She lent us 185k in cash so we didn\u2019t need to take on a mortgage. At the time, I suggested we make a promissory note for that - they declined it (mostly because it\u2019s too much work for them and they got lazy, and \u201cno need to keep tab on family\u201d). I was also unhappy about this entire event as well for multiple reasons (it\u2019s also hard for me to just cash out 50k, it would almost deplete my entire emergency savings). They though I was an AH to not return the generosity and trust my MIL bestowed on me.\n\nAm I an AH for not just giving her 50k without any hestitation, promissory notes, or any documentations of this? (I also KNOW that IRS will likely audit me in the next 3 years, my income is about to quadtriple).\n\nQuick edit: She tried to pull a fast one on her ex. Her ex gave her 30k to help buy a house in china. SHe transferred the house to be under HER mother\u2019s name (my husband\u2019s grandmother), then claimed in court that 30k was a gift to his MIL and therefore cannot get it back. despite it was a property purchased during marriage. So if somehting happened, I don\u2019t want it suddenly to be \u201cYou owe me 185k, you just gifted me 50k, so you still owe me the full amount\u201d.", "created_utc": 1669013012, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0rwm7/aita_to_ask_my_mil_to_write_me_a_promissory_note/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They aren\u2019t even legally obligated to pay her back the 185k at all, because the MIL made the stupid decision to trust an AH like OP to pay her back.", "I could but if we\u2019re divorced, who knows which side my husband would take. WE are ok but i have seen divorce change people\n\n I don\u2019t want to have any confusion or be dragged to court and deal with this.", "That\u2019s not what i said but cool", "But, he is entitled to half of that.", "Her owing the ex half the 185k is not your problem. She did that to herself. You owe 185k and can give her 50k but require a document accepting that the 50k is towards the 185k she borrowed you... Where the money goes afterwards is not your concern, only your debt is your concern.", "I don't blame her, seeing as she loaned you a huge sum of money, interest-free, for a decade, without documentation.", "She'd have to convince a court of that, and it seems unlikely they'd accept that her loan was a loan but your repayment was a gift.", "If she did that, you could just claim the 185k was a gift. \n\n\nStop accusing her of being untrustworthy. You\u2019re the only one in this situation that\u2019s demonstrating that trait.", "So what you actually want is a receipt? That I can understand. But you would have evidence you'd paid her from your bank transaction listing.", "You need to document it anyways, promissory note, loan, or else", "That's not a promissory note, that's a receipt.\n\nAlso, you stated several times that you'd be \"loaning\" the money to her, which is very different from paying back money that she loaned to you", "Yeah, this sounds like a really big legal issue here. Likely one that would land both sides in trouble if the IRS gets involved.", "Idk. It\u2019s a giant mess.", "Fyi\u2026 i wanted to set up a payment plan but she and my husband said no. So instead i invested the extra cash. To suddenly need to pull out 50k in this market is worse than if i just took on a mortgage at 3-4%\n\nShe\u2019s the kind who thinks she\u2019s always right despite not knowing anything", "I wanted a back then too. I was the one saying, hey let\u2019s write a promissory note saying e owe you 185k to be paid at the time we sell the house. She didn\u2019t want to.\n\n(I didn\u2019t mention that i also didn\u2019t ask her for the 185k loan)", "True but I\u2019d rather just avoid the court and have it in paper in case god forbid she gets dementia or tries to waste my time in court in the future.\n\nShe attempted to do just that during this divorce court settlement. Which I\u2019m angry about for a whole different reason.\n\nIn general, I can just rant on and on about her for a long ass time but i have never been disrespectful in front of her due to my culture", "Pretty sure she and my husband said it was loan, so somewhere it was probably written in some email vs text that it was a loan", "I don\u2019t want her to risk claiming this was a gift. And it won\u2019t be applied to the 185k balance", "...that **she's** created. Either she wants some of her money now and faces the consequences of collecting, or she figures out a way to wait til the divorce is done. She seems very dishonest and shady, so cover your butt no matter what!\n\nYstillTA for not paying her a dime back all this time, but NTA for the spot she's trying to put you in now because she messed up. \n\nGiant mess indeed. Sincerely, I wish you the best of luck here. What a nightmare.", "Fair enough... I'll change my vote to NTA because it seems like you've done everything you can to do things right here.", "But you did accept it on those terms.", "You pay her 50k, and put the bank tranfer note to be: \"Partial repayment for house loan, 135k to go\".", "Why not sell the house now, that would give her back her 185k and mean you wouldn't have to worry about the 50k.  This would also mean she wouldn't be able to say the 50 was a gift and that you still owe her the 185.", "Ok?\n\n So just send her an email saying you agree to pay her 50k of the 185k loan, and stop trying to pretend that the person who gave you a 185k interest free loan with no formal documentation (because she trusts you) is the untrustworthy one here. \n\nWhat\u2019s going to happen when you sell your house and have the full amount to pay her back, but she doesn\u2019t want to sign some form about it? Are you going to falsely accuse her of somehow trying to rip you off and refuse to pay her back then too?\n\nYTA pay the woman and stop insulting her.", "OK, I can ses that. Have edited my judgement.", "I mean tbf it seemed like MIL gifted that money to her and even said that since they\u2019re family they don\u2019t need to keep tabs. She can\u2019t sing another tune now just because she\u2019s put herself in deep shit also why must it only be OP who has to cash out 50k? That\u2019s so fishy to me especially since it\u2019s both HER son and OP who used the money for the house. MIL is extremely irrational to just expect anyone to loan her 50k at random now that she needs it, if she \u201clent\u201d OP and her husband 185k that\u2019s because clearly she was able to. I hate people like this. OP get something in writing even if she complains and if she refuses then simply don\u2019t pay anything.", "My husband did. \n\nBy the way, she tells everyone it was a gift and it entire Chinese society is like \u201cwow you\u2019re mil is so nice to buy you a house for your wedding gift \u201c.\n\n I\u2019m like\u2026 what? Asked husband to clarify, he said it was a loan. (Which I\u2019m fine with)", "Because we are moving next year. I don\u2019t want to move twice in 8 months. Plus it takes time to sell the house. She needs the money within 1 month.", "She tried to claim her ex gave her mother 30k as a gift\u2026idk how true that is.\n\nHow am i going to prove to IRS when I get 50k back this situation?", "I think you need to add to your post as an edit that the agreement was to pay it back in a lump sum on the sale of the house and the fact that your husband accepted the money. It will affect the judgement. It won\u2019t count in The original character limit."]}
