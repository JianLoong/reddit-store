If she really is your friend, you could simply remind her that getting famous as a pop star is about 1% talent and 99% a combination of marketability, connections, timing, and luck, and she'd be better off if she had a backup plan.\n\nYou, who are not a pop star either, elected instead to punch down at her.\n\nTo quote one of this country's greatest songwriters: \"when you punish a person for dreaming [their] dream, don't expect [them] to thank or forgive you.\"", "YTA.

You could have easily counseled her about having a safety net/backup plan but you decided it was necessary to be vicious. I guess it was uncomfortable for you to see her so happy going after a dream when you lost the opportunity to go after it yourself, but punishing her for it makes you a bitter asshole.", "YTA. If you make one rule for yourself in life, it should be, \"Don't shit on other people's joy.\" Is she terrible at this? Probably. Will she fail? Probably. But who the hell are you to crush her dreams before she even tries? She's excited to pursue this. She's happy about it. This is an adult, I assume she's capable of understanding the risk in quitting her job and spending her savings. HER JOB. HER SAVINGS. Ultimately, her CHOICE. ALso your opinion is not everyone's opinion, so it's better to keep it to yourself unless someone actually ASKED you.\n\nUnless your friend is in physical danger or about to be scammed by someone, you don't interfere. You support. Your job as a friend is to be a supportive cheerleader. You don't have to lie to her, but you also don't have to tell her she will never succeed. You don't even know that it's true, you just don't believe in her. It's not wrong to feel that way, but telling her outright was super harsh. You told her that she doesn't have the talent. That she'll fail so hard that she'll end up homeless? Who does that? Not someone that I would call a friend. That's not tough love, you basically told her to quit even trying to get better because she sucks so bad it's hopeless. And you're surprised by her reaction? \n\nMy friends would tell me that they are nervous for the risk I'm taking, but they are behind me, period. And that would be it. Let this adult woman make her own decisions. You've somehow convinced yourself that you were doing her a \"favor\" or \"had her best interests at heart,\" but all you did was hurt her and show yourself to be cold and cruel. You owe her an apology, but she may not want to hear it. Take is as a learning experience... support your friends. Give your advice when they ASK for it.", "YTA. There are so many famous people out there that say \u201ceveryone told me I couldn\u2019t do it\u201d. People have to be allowed to dream.

It's one thing to enable delusion, it's another thing to be mean to someone that is already hell-bent on doing something stupid. The detail of how you used to be a singer just makes it sound like you're jealous she's giving it her all and you can't because of an injury. I don't know why else you would include that if you weren't bitter.\n\nI think that bitterness is why you staged that intervention, not genuine concern for a friend. Because friends don't go out of their way to push their friends down. It's not like she came to you for advice, you offered unsolicited advice that was, in reality, just cruelty. Particularly because the only way an untrained singer can get better is through lessons, which is what she's doing. But it seems you actively *want* her to fail.\n\nYou didn't mention at all that she was forcing you to listen to her or entertain her delusions or that she was asking you to enable or validate her decisions. That's why your \"tough love\" wasn't love, and it wasn't tough, either. It's just bitterness.", "You could try saying she should start small in open mic sessions to gauge an audience reaction to her talents.", "YTA - her finances or talent level is really none of your business. It's not your place to kill her dreams. Her vocal coach should be the one to tell her this, *if she's really that bad*. In addition to that, you and other friends should be supportive, even if you think she may fail, rather than talk about her behind her back.", "YTA. She is putting hard work and money into her passion. Do you know anything about vocal pedagogy or technique to truly judge whether or not she's improving? If you think she'll be unsuccessful, you should keep it to yourself. Imagine your friend thinking you're an awful singer and telling you, to your face, \"you have zero talent, will never find success, and are going to be homeless soon.\" I don't imagine you would enjoy that very much. You should never talk to your friends the way that you described in your post.", "YTA - why yuck her yum? How is this impacting you? \n\nAnd having sang in a local band doesnt make you the authority on talent.", "That's not her tough love works. You didn't had any love. You didn't care about her or her dreams at all. You didn't have a professional advice, you just pooped all over dreams. YTA", "YTA, not for believing she has no future in it beyond karaoke or a local jam band. But because you had little tact addressing her decision to go for broke with it. It\u2019s her dream, let her live it (even if it\u2019s not the right financial decision). Not your money, not your work that earned it, not your consequences when it fails.\n\nYou said you yourself were in a rising local band but injury stopped you. You got your shot at your dream, let her have hers. There\u2019s a reason LA and NYC never have a shortage of service industry workers; all the people who didn\u2019t make it in the entertainment industry.", "I agree that financially it is a huge risk and not a smart idea, obviously. Chasing passion SAFELY means to chase them after work and on your days off, or if you have someone who is willing to support you through the process (parents, partner, etc). Most people aren't lucky enough to become famous overnight, and most of them have to put in tons of hours and effort to make it. The friend here needs to assume she won't be that lucky and needs a safety net to support her while she works toward her dream.\n\nI think she could benefit from a perspective shift. As opposed to telling her she's not good enough, tell her what she IS good at. Has she explored different, less conventional methods of singing that she might excel at, or other similar avenues that might use her strengths more? A lot of vtubers aren't great singers, but their personalities get them a lot of fans who still support their singing because they are invested in the streamer as a person. Could she go a similar route, with or without the anime avatar?\n\nIf she's really set on the one thing, there's nothing anyone else can do to change her mind. Dreamers are frequently told to cut out the naysayers, and that's exactly what she did. She doesn't need negativity; she needs a friend who is supportive, who cares about both her passions AND well-being.\n\nYTA for your approach, and for looking down on her for pursuing something you think she's bad at. You could have been caring, you could have focused on the positives and on her strengths, but instead you approached it like you just wanted to squash her joy. As an adult who is ALSO pursuing unlikely dreams, I'd have blocked you too.", "YTA not for trying to help her and tell her the painful truth, but for the way you did it.\n\nA real friend will convey the painful truth, and you tried to do just that. It's actually a noble thing to do, especially if your friend is risking her financial stability and everything that follows it. But you should have done that in a more subtle way. If you did it but it didn't work, at least you would knew that you tried. In fact, by doing it so bluntly you are likely to achieve the opposite result- put her on defence, make her think that you're jealous and don't want her to be happy, and as the result- possibly lose your friend. Finally, the world is full of people who have been told that they won't achieve something, yet they did. You simply can't know for certain that she's never going to achieve the success as a singer- even if moderate one.", "You sound very jealous of your friend. Since your career in singing has failed. And you are unhappy with yourself so you wanna be a nasty ugly person to the friend who is starting her career in singing. This a you problem that needs to be fix before you end up hurting yourself.", "YTA. While she needs to hers the hard truth you could of handled this wayyy better than you did. Or you could of keep your unsolicited opinion to yourself. Either way the way you went about it was pretty cruel and insensitive.", "YTA.  It sounds like this is something she has to learn on her own.  Back off, and learn how to help by being kind and supportive. Lady Gaga's classmates told her she would never be famous.

I could quibble with your delivery if I wanted but considering you seem to be the only one who's spoken up, good on ya.", "Sometimes you have to let people make their own mistakes and find their own way back to stability.  And the AH judgment here isn't so much for what you said as how you said it, the way you portrayed it here came off incredibly insensitive.

Stop wasting energy on this person.", "OP, don\u2019t listen to all these self-important, judgmental douchewads on here telling you YTA. I swear, they are really pissing me off to the point of anger. \n\nAfter reading your post and all your comments, I am convinced you have your friend\u2019s well-being at heart and you are in a good position to have a worthy opinion of her prospects in the music business. Screw those nay-sayers, who suggest you are trampling on her dreams. You are being a damn good friend to her by helping her to see the reality of the situation before her life goes to total shit. Someday she will come to you and totally thank you and apologize for not accepting your wise counsel.\n\nNTA.", "No I agree, but there should have been a middle ground. Another commentor broke it down better about how to approach this without being a dick about it.

There is a much kinder, considerate way to word those concerns. \"Hey, I know you have been working hard toward your goal of being a singer.

It's not nice to hear but there's nearly always a good reason.", "If you've already given your hand at helping, it's time to sit back and let her make her own decisions.

As a friend, you should be supportive of her in all her endeavors, even if you disagree with them.", "Name fits.  You fail to realize what you say has no bearing so stop saying it.

It's like that Brazilian deaf transgender woman that sang Whitney Houston for X factor or whatever show that was. They had no idea that everyone was laughing at them but it was tragic to watch a musically handicapped person sing and no know they're embarrassing themselves. People set this person up for failure by not being honest with them. That's an asshole move. Obviously not the same situation, but the principle still applies.", "I agree about the hint of jealousy. OP is not wrong but is the asshole. If you decide to take on the duty of being the asshole that looks your friend in the eye and crush her dreams by telling her she is not good enough, then you knew what you were getting yourself into. OP decided to be the asshole. If OP knew anything about what it takes to make it as a star then OP would know that there is a whole internet full of people ready to crush her friends dream in the coldest way possible. OP could have said her friend needs more work and if her friend didnt want to listen and posted a singing vid or something then she wouldve gotten some honesty real quickly. A good friend would try to help improve their friend ability and dismantle her naivety without being cruel because the industry will do all the cruelty. there is such thing as constructive critisism and this was not it.", "\\[tl;dr OP isn't \"enabling\" friend by refraining from being a jerk; the market will dictate her potential success quickly.\\] \n\n  \nFirst--if she's really serious about being a pop star, she's eventually going to be going to auditions and seeking representation--and, believe me, she'll find out pretty quickly when she's going through that process whether or not she has what it takes to be marketable.  \n\n\nSecond--look, another person mentioned in a different comment that it is often the truly clueless performers that are most convinced they are the bees' knees, and that is very, very true. But there are certain things you can't hand-wave away once you get in front of people--*if* you can get in front of people.\n\nThird--the idea of \"I want to be a pop star and, thus, I'm going to chase my dream\" is so wildly anachronistic at this point that anyone willing to chase it in the way she is probably has to learn this lesson in the most brutal way imaginable. Pop stars are very meticulously curated, cultivated, and marketed--nobody \"accidentally\" makes it anymore, and the ones that do often do so in ways that have virtually nothing to do with their talent. There was [this article in Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/pro/record-labels-adjust-expectations-pop-stars/) the other day about how major labels are despairing over their inability to break new pop stars--*people aren't really into that kind of thing anymore*, or at least they're not going to spend money on it.  \n\n\nFourth--regardless of all that, it's not OP's call what their friend does with her life.", "Look. Is she tone deaf? Because if that\u2019s what you mean you should put that in the OP. There\u2019s a difference between subjective differences in vocal tastes and someone who can\u2019t hold a pitch and I think all the ytas are getting confused by that. \n\nYou can have a not so great voice and sing certain genres and be fine- death metal, punk, anything where auto tune is cool. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying based on the comments. \n\nSomeone who is completely tone deaf has no place as a singer unless it\u2019s as a novelty joke act from the blooper reel from early aughts Idol.", "My heart always breaks a little for those people, like damn they don\u2019t have even one person who will be real with them but I guess this is the flip side, some of the wannabes will just never accept it, they\u2019re delusional.", "professional vocalist here. I disagree with this. I think most people are able to learn how to sing decently well. Especially if they are dedicated and willing to learn and practice and take criticism. yes there are rare cases that some people may be tone deaf and unable to hear the correct notes, or they have conditions with their sinuses, or their throat may have nodes but these are all situations that would not apply to the majority of people who attempt to sing. Even people with nodes are able to rebuild their own voices. taylor swift and selena gomes both dont sing that great TBH and are famous...I love Taylor by the way but yeah I dont think having the most amazing voice would be enough to bring fame. its not about the talent or ability, its also the drive and the hunger. Kid cudi is no brilliant singer and again same with selena...there are other elements here that make someone fame worthy."]}
