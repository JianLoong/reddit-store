We've been together for 6 years, all good stuff, no issues - it's all good there.\n\nMy conundrum comes from my family side. I grew up in a small family, just me, my mum and an older sister for the majority of my life as my dad wasn't around. My mum got remarried when I was about 19 and I'm close with my new step siblings. I have never been close and I actually haven't spoken to my mum or sister (with a couple of exceptions) in the last 5 years after a big bust up that had been brewing for years. I have however, always been very close with my grandparents and am still in contact with my wider family.  I've never badmouthed my mum, I've not even really gone into detail as to why I don't want contact with her as I'm concerned it will cause a wider issue with the family as she would come out in a bad light.\n\nNow to the issue - my family and friends know I'm not close with mum/sister and the question was always whether or not I'd invite them. This wasn't a difficult decision surprisingly as I've always maintained that I would not make a \"thing\" about it and would be civil with them whenever I came across them so they would be invited. I thought this would avoid a crisis but during my weekly dinner with my grandad (grandma has passed), he mentioned that the family has decided they will not come to the wedding if my mum doesn't feel comfortable going. There was no wider explanation of what would make her comfortable however and I'm not about to cause an argument with my grandad by pushing him.\n\nThis topic now comes up quite a lot at our weekly dinners, and it came out today that it stems from our mentioning that we would have a top table at the wedding, featuring my partners parents, best man, maid of honour etc but my mum wouldn't be there. Effectively the demand from the family is that if my mum isn't sat at the top table then she wouldn't feel comfortable as it's a public snub (despite our estrangement not being a secret)  and therefore the rest of my family wouldn't go. They're saying I'm being unreasonable and putting demands on the family by sitting her at a \"family\" table.\n\nI want my family to come to my wedding, but I cannot sit next to that woman on my wedding day. I'm feeling a bit upset about all this, so I'm querying whether or not I am TA.\n\nAnyway, any direct feedback would be appreciated (sorry for the long post).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Thanks everyone for your comments. I've spoken to my grandad, explained everything to him and he's now feeling quite bad. Basically his confusion has come from my mum has been telling him she has no idea why I don't want to see her and there's been a lot of background chatting about it in the family. Because of this I've said I'll happily sit down with them all (primarily my grandad, auntie, mum, sister) and explain everything in detail and that it's there decision not mine. I reiterated that this is not me putting demands on them, it's them putting them on me. Not sure if this meeting will happen, but I've said I'll do it so the balls in there court.

Polite and professional, but to the point. Something link this.\n\n\"Good day to those who may recieve this message, it has come to my attention that many relatives feel the need to boycott my wedding due to my mother not being at the top table despite the condition of our relationship. I would like those who feel strongly about this to contact me directly as I have made a decision that may affect these specific people.\n\nFrom (enter name here)\"\n\nOnce I figure out who feels strongly about sending out a mass email to those specific people with just a blunt message.\n\n\"You no longer have a seat at my wedding for not respecting how I conduct my STRAINED relationships. Have a pleasant day.\" \n\nAnd then I'd just text my mum \"you are not welcome to my wedding\". (I would only do this if my mum was actually the type to do stuff like this, I'm lucky enough to know she isn't)\n\nAgain, this is just me!!! Do what you think is right, but do not be guilted into this just because your family care more about appearances.", "You have to accept that your family will not be at your wedding. Period.", "op=NTA\n\nIt's your wedding, your choice.\n\nIt seems you have been kind, not exposing the reason for your low contact.  Honestly, at least for Granddad, I'd tell him the truth.  Let him make an informed choice. (checked comments--looks like you've told him).  Consider telling the family more of the truth too.\n\nAlso saw comment about mother making scenes, if she chooses to attend as a guest--I'd suggest seating a friend next to her that is prepared to walk her butt right out of there if she goes off script.", "NTA\n\n\nBut I think this can be easily resolved by only having the bride and groom along with the wedding party sitting at the top table. \n\nAll family members and non-wedding party members seated at separate tables.\n\nThis is actually a pretty standard setup for many weddings. \n\nWith this setup, there is really no reason for people to take a offense", "NTA. And I\u2019m sorry for the hurt it\u2019s going to bring but they don\u2019t get to give ultimatums for your event. They can come to the wedding,\u2019or stay home. But I would probably air out the laundry so they make their choice with all the facts. Your mom is absolutely spinning her own version and not trying to keep any peace, Because no one else would even think of table seating without her stirring the pot. If she can do that to you, on your wedding day,\u2019you don\u2019t need to protect her image", "NTA. just tell them that they made their choice and uninvite them and downscale if you can. i\u2019d honestly say im a bit disappointed that youve brought this up to me rather late in the wedding planning i would have made different plans if i knew i had such an unsupportive family.", "We just did a sweetheart table for myself and my husband and let everyone else sit where they wanted. It was a lot easier to let people pick their own seats than try to figure out the politics of a seating arrangement.", "Sweetheart table ftw. I loved it because it let everyone in the wedding party sit with whoever made the most sense (family or various friend groups). And it had the effect of making people feel more comfortable coming up to talk to us during the meal because they weren't interrupting a huge number of people.", "It sounds like your mother has had plenty of time to work on your relationship since the \"big bust up\" 5 years ago. You were more than generous to invite her to your wedding.\n\nBut that wasn't good enough for her. It sounds like she is more concerned with what other people think about HER that what YOU feel.\n\nNTA.\n\nETA: I would make sure everyone has heard your version of events and then let them decide. I rather doubt they heard the truth.", "My sister did this as well and it was great. She's the youngest so we all were in her wedding party but got to sit with out kids. Perfect solution to OP's problem.", "i'm so sorry, it sounds really stressful", "You aren\u2019t wrong for not wanting her apart of your special day. If she\u2019s a danger to you and you had to go NC than she\u2019s a danger to other children. And abuse doesn\u2019t just mean physical her being manipulative is a form of abuse so again your mother is an abuser. I know you want your families support but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to give it to you without knowing all the facts. You either go NC with your whole family for trying to force things with a women you want nothing to do with or you explain why you won\u2019t reconcile with her(you don\u2019t have to share every detail hell a simple her mistreatment of me caused mental issues and it\u2019s unsafe for me to be around her). It\u2019s your wedding you and your love should have everything your heart desires so when you look back on that day you have no regrets.", "I wouldn't do that unless you also make sure they know the truth.  If they know the truth and still take her side then cut them off, but don't dump them if they only know what she's told them.", "No. Stop blaming women for men\u2019s bad behavior. Your grandfather told you that he and the family won\u2019t attend your wedding if your mom isn\u2019t comfortable. Take your blinders off. Your grandfather is an AH too.", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m blaming women for men\u2019s behaviour, I think that\u2019s a hell of a stretch especially when we\u2019re talking about specific people", "NTA. I\u2019d personally tell anyone that doesn\u2019t come that you\u2019ll take that as the end of your relationship with them. \n\nIf they\u2019re choosing to side with her and actively help her pressure you into giving her an honor at your wedding that she doesn\u2019t deserve, then they are not a good person in your life. If they choose her side, you should let them go. \n\nI suspect that will also include your grandfather who is close to you. I\u2019d suggest telling him that he\u2019s making a life decision. If that what he chooses, you\u2019re not going to make a scene, you\u2019re not going to beg or try to convince him. But you\u2019ll thank him for all his support over the years but if his path is to stand with your mother, then this is where you go your separate ways.", "This is exactly the reason why I didn\u2019t have a wedding and opted for the courthouse. You\u2019re NTA but there\u2019s no version of this that ends well.", "NTA, but this is the prize won by \u201cnot playing dirty\u201d and not \u201cairing laundry\u201d.", "NTA", "Nta. Stop protecting your mom. Tell everyone why there is a problem, then let them know this is why she will be sitting where you put her!!", "NTA\n\nis your wedding. simply as that. it's weird how they are trying to manipulate you into doing something that will make you uncomfortable. they should respect your feelings. on top of that, it isn't like you are leaving your mom out or anything, you just would make her sit at a different table. what's the big deal?\n\nidk if this is the right thing to do, but i'd just send the invitations and make them sit where you want them to sit. that's your decision and they should respect it. if they don't want to go then that's on them. although i kinda think that they would go anyways, seems they are just using that to make you feel guilty or smth.", "INFO: to determine your answer here, we need to know why you cut off your mother and sister. If it was a justifiable reason you\u2019re not the ass, if not, then you are one.", "NTA. If you\u2019re interested in trying to find a compromise tho, might I suggest doing a sweetheart table instead? My ex insisted that we invite the little brother of his best friend/best man. This same little brother had been dating one of my bridesmaids long before the wedding & had been broken up for at least a year but the little brother was still hung up on her. She was bringing a date with her who knew no one else so he would\u2019ve been odd-man out at any table I put him at which didn\u2019t include her. I was like \u2018f**k, how do I make this work?\u2019\n\nI had several guests who I view as surrogate brothers (they\u2019ve all known me since I was 15 but they are ultimately my older brother\u2019s friends.) I didn\u2019t want my bro stuck at a table without his friends just as much as I didn\u2019t want little bro & his ex to be at the same, or the date to be by himself for the reception since he was for the rest of it by nature of her being in the wedding.\n\nEnded up having ex & I at a sweetheart table near the center, then just sat everyone else with who I thought they should. I put my older bro & SIL at the table with my surrogate brothers & their spouses, the bridesmaid & date at a different table than little brother, & let the parents decide who they wanted at their table (my ex-MIL for example wanted to sit with her daughter & fam who were all in the wedding, so I put them there, my Grandma wanted to be with her siblings so I did that, etc.) \n\nDoing it that way gave me a lot of leeway in seating & placated most people in the end. If you do decide to this, just make sure if you ask who they\u2019d want at their table that it\u2019s not a guarantee, it\u2019s simply you asking for an opinion that you may or may not be able to work into your plans. \n\nUnless you\u2019re dead set on the high table because it\u2019s simply what you want, or keeping it just to spite someone/make a point (might be petty but I\u2019m not above that myself!) then keep it & still NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s ultimately your wedding, so do what you & your partner want.\n\nAlso, Congratulations on the upcoming wedding! Make sure to take some time to stop & actually enjoy the day when it comes!", "NTA", "This is very similar to the approach I took, just updated the post with the latest but yeah, thanks, I agree", "True, I completely get this. I tried to post that originally but it kept getting deleted as it broke the rules with the description of it so I am unfortunately unable to be specific", "Not a bad suggestion. However I\u2019d actually have a proper \u201cbreak up\u201d with anyone who says no.", "Brilliant!", "Can you safely ask your grandpa why your comfort is less important than your mother's at your wedding?", "But by doing that, you allow her to get the whole family to ostracise you. Give your invites, tell her no, explain to all the family your reasons and let them judge the whole picture.  If they refuse to come after that, draw your lines.
