The plan was to help her finish university, and then let her work for a year to save money and get a bigger place before I move out. However, I have had my fill of abuse and disrespect, and I want to leave soon.\n\nShe\u2019s also in her last year, and my intention is to move out\u00a0 as soon as she finished her course.\u00a0\n\nLet me give you examples of the kind of disrespect and abuse I mean:\n\nI babysit my nephews almost every day and do the school runs, and when they make messes, I ask them to tidy up and they disobey, roll their eyes, and argue. I take away their toys, and when their mother comes home, I let her know what happened and she gets emotionally manipulated by the kids, she tells me off in front of them and gives them back their things. As soon as she comes home, they fake cry and act like they've been wronged.\n\nShe\u2019s shouted and insulted me several times when she\u2019s in a bad mood (which is often), in front of her kids. She\u2019s done it so many times that not even the kids respect me anymore.\n\nMy authority with my nephews has been undermined so many times. They\u2019re very unruly and misbehave badly, they get excluded often from school and when I take their games away or make them do chores, she immediately comes in the room, and literally tells me off, hugs them and lets them have their toys back.\n\nThey\u2019ve witnessed her  disrespect me numerous times in ways I am not allowed to mention. And almost every time she apologises, yet a few days or weeks later, her aggressions begin again.\u00a0The loss of face and humiliation in front of the kids amplifies the way I feel.\n\nI\u2019ve moved out before, and she cried and begged me to come back, and like a overly empathetic younger brother, I always came back and within weeks the disrespect returned. I felt sorry for her situation, being alone with those kids and having to juggle education and home life.\n\nShe\u2019s unaware of my intentions. But I will go earlier than we agreed. Right now, she thinks we\u2019re cool and has no idea I\u2019m making arrangements to find a place.\n\nMoving out will be a huge setback for her. But I think it\u2019s overdue. I plan to let her know soon, and I feel like an idiot for staying a few more months just so she at least finishes university and gets her degree, but I am not cruel.", "created_utc": 1682269726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wig4y/aita_for_planning_to_move_out_and_break_my/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's okay to leave an abusive situation, even if it leaves your abuser in a tough spot.\n\nI hope you are successful in beginning the next chapter and that you have support from a friend or therapist to manage the fallout of when you leave and keep you grounded if she tries to gaslight you.\n\nEta: auto-correct issue.", "Absolutely NTA. She had the kids, she can parent them. You\u2019ve taken this for far too long. Tell her everything you just told us, and let her lie in the bed she made", "NTA. I see why sis has no man (besides you) in the picture. You have already gone above and beyond, and sis shows no respect or gratitude. You should just tell her you're moving as soon as you find a place and why so she can make other arrangements. Stay calm, but don't back down. She brought this on herself, but she will get ugly about it. All the more reason to look after yourself and get on with your own life.\n\nETA there are always relatives/friends who think you should do more. I say it's time for these relatives to step up then.", "NTA - you made it clear that you are not okay with how things are. She even apologized for behavior yet has not changed. She has this coming, don\u2019t back down.", "NTA - Sure sounds like she is using you as a live in nanny.", "NTA as you are giving her sufficient notice so she can be prepared. You could just show her this  post and tell her your moveout date.", "NTA. You stepped up and helped more than most people would. She'll have to figure it out.", "NTA. You need to learn how to not pay attention to her manipulation and cut ties. \nRun fast and far", "NTA.

You should have BEEN gone.", "Update when possible\nPlease \n\nNTA", "This is a tough one, but I\u2019m leaning towards NTA. Everything you\u2019ve said here leads me to believe that you\u2019ve gone above and beyond. Yes, you made the promise, but you didn\u2019t take into account the abuse you\u2019d be receiving. I\u2019m especially concerned about the \u2018not allowed to talk about\u2019 stuff. This smacks of a domestic abuse kind of situation, and even though you are the man and not a spouse, you have every right to keep yourself safe. I feel for the kids, but you seem to have given her every opportunity to address her behavior, and she hasn\u2019t taken it.", "NTA\n\n I didn't even need to read it. You're not responsible for your decade older sister or her kids. Move out and live your life.", "Typically I'd want a little more info here. Like did you guys ever discuss how to raise the kids? Because it kinda sounds like she just never wants to be the disciplinarian so the kids love her more or something. That's my bias from witnessing situations (yes multiple situations) like that first hand recently.   \n\n\nI'm going to say NTA. Regardless, you were there trying to help her get her life together.

It is harder but your relationship might be better in the long run. Just make it very very clear this is your final decision. If she gaslights you, threaten to leave earlier.

The decision to leave is the right one, but we shouldn\u2019t discount the difficulty of coming to that decision.", "I'll say NTA it's really commendable that you stepped up like that, shows you're a really good and responsible person, apparently not many would do that.\n\nBut if your sister really wanted you to co-parent, the two you must have a united front for the kids. Insted, she makes you out to be the \"bad cop\" and the scapegoat, while she gets to play the kind and compassionate mommy. She's spoiling them rotten and teaches them that actions don't have consequences, she's a horrible mom. It might be worth kindly and with compassion pointing this out to her before you leave. Or to someone she actually listens ro, because it seems like she has no respect for you.", "Well then you're both still in the wrong. You were 19 and asked to \"be a father.\" But then she has parenting expectations that don't line up with your preferences. You're a babysitter not a parent. She's the parent and should communicate her expectations, you're jumping in unprepared."]}
