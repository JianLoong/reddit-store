The plan was to help her finish university, and then let her work for a year to save money and get a bigger place before I move out. However, I have had my fill of abuse and disrespect, and I want to leave soon.\n\nShe\u2019s also in her last year, and my intention is to move out\u00a0 as soon as she finished her course.\u00a0\n\nLet me give you examples of the kind of disrespect and abuse I mean:\n\nI babysit my nephews almost every day and do the school runs, and when they make messes, I ask them to tidy up and they disobey, roll their eyes, and argue. I take away their toys, and when their mother comes home, I let her know what happened and she gets emotionally manipulated by the kids, she tells me off in front of them and gives them back their things. As soon as she comes home, they fake cry and act like they've been wronged.\n\nShe\u2019s shouted and insulted me several times when she\u2019s in a bad mood (which is often), in front of her kids. She\u2019s done it so many times that not even the kids respect me anymore.\n\nMy authority with my nephews has been undermined so many times. They\u2019re very unruly and misbehave badly, they get excluded often from school and when I take their games away or make them do chores, she immediately comes in the room, and literally tells me off, hugs them and lets them have their toys back.\n\nThey\u2019ve witnessed her  disrespect me numerous times in ways I am not allowed to mention. And almost every time she apologises, yet a few days or weeks later, her aggressions begin again.\u00a0The loss of face and humiliation in front of the kids amplifies the way I feel.\n\nI\u2019ve moved out before, and she cried and begged me to come back, and like a overly empathetic younger brother, I always came back and within weeks the disrespect returned. I felt sorry for her situation, being alone with those kids and having to juggle education and home life.\n\nShe\u2019s unaware of my intentions. But I will go earlier than we agreed. Right now, she thinks we\u2019re cool and has no idea I\u2019m making arrangements to find a place.\n\nMoving out will be a huge setback for her. But I think it\u2019s overdue. I plan to let her know soon, and I feel like an idiot for staying a few more months just so she at least finishes university and gets her degree, but I am not cruel.", "created_utc": 1682269726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wig4y/aita_for_planning_to_move_out_and_break_my/", "score": 263, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m especially concerned about the \u2018not allowed to talk about\u2019 stuff. This smacks of a domestic abuse kind of situation, and even though you are the man and not a spouse, you have every right to keep yourself safe.

Insted, she makes you out to be the \"bad cop\" and the scapegoat, while she gets to play the kind and compassionate mommy.
