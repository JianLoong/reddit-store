But after a few months it never got mentioned again, until I was visiting and they said it was getting a bit expensive to get you a room to yourself so we've had to book it we were missing the cheap deal window. No contact no effort...\nThey don't even mention it to me when they go away now and when it finally gets out its some excuse like 'we thought you'd struggle to get a week off', 'we planned it last minute got a good package deal'. \n\nWell last night I was staying with my family, and my 2 younger sibs were suprised that they were flying to Greece tomorrow morning. Right in front of me. My dad said 'we thought you'd atuggle to book a week off work' like I mentioned, I work full time and have no other serious commitments so hooking a week off with a few weeks notice would be fine, i have savings which they know and could've easily paid for myself Inc spending. The last time we went away was 2018.\n\nAfter my sibs went to bed, I told my parents that I know they didn't think I was part of the family anymore, they don't include me in 'family' dinners, gatherings, holidays, or days out. Its easy for me to get time off I have holiday for a reason at work, I can pay abd their excuses are just lies because they don't want me there. I started crying I was so mad and drove home. I'm currently no contact, I don't know what to say to them. They haven't reached out to me but I'm sure I won't have tainted their holiday experience. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my family for going on holiday?\n\nEDIT: Any 'go on holiday on ur own' or 'you're an adult and should be independent' comments are just going to be ignored, I have clearly stated I want to be included, here and to my family i.e I was soo excited to go on the cruise. They were going to pay for me and I'd send it back so everyone's cabins would be together. I don't have a friend group, only my partner but not been together very long. I still want to be a part of MY family events...\n\nUPDATE: I would like to thank everyone who has commented today. I feel so filled with emotion but more importantly support from people I've never met. I will decide what to do while my family away as I want to clear my head. Some have suggested NC, but I dont think thats the right move for me, yet. I still love them a lot as badly as I have been treated. It's hard to accept so I will have some thought.

Find your words like a big girl and talk to your parents. What you are feeling is hurt and you need to talk to them about how you feel instead of shrieking or refusing to speak to them at all.

Your siblings still live at home, so they go where your parents go. \n\nTheir lives continue even when you are not there. So dinners, trips, all those things still happen. \n\nWith the cruise, did you make any effort to book it? Do any research? Ask them when they are going? Since you were paying your own way, you would have bought your own ticket. You should have been corordinating with them. \n\nIf you want to part of the daily activities they do, you have to put some work in, as you live out the house.", "NTA\n\n What if, now hear me out, you go on vacation without them. You say you haven't had any other commitments and only do work, if that has been true since 2018 then you really need one, and get this, they aren't required to be there for you to have one! And if you don't wanna go alone, perhaps invite your siblings (assuming you can pay for them). Life is too short to wait for an invite that will never come, so make your own invitations.", "I left college at 18 after my a-levels and never went to university, I was meant to do as my family are super driven on education but never ended up going at all", "Because I still want to spend time with my family. I don't have a friend group, only my boyfriend and don't particularity want to solo travel. I don't know why u would assume because I'm a young adult I don't want to go away with them", "I'm the one that maintains contact, I phone few days, my dad will phone me maybe every 2 weeks if that. I'm not going no contact I just haven't spoken to them since last night..", "NTA. That's a very unkind behaviour from your parents. I can understand why you would feel so hurt after 3 years of that treatment.", "What are you doing for work? Is it minimum wage? Does it involve physical labor? Would your family consider it \"beneath them?\" Did they have a specific idea about what you should have studied? None of this would justify their behavior obviously, but it sounds like they may think otherwise. (Sorry for so many questions)", "Loads of people don't go to uni, and with it being that you have to be in education or apprenticeship until 18 now, many people go that route after college (not uni). I mean, I personally regret not going to uni but did well in college and got a job in that field straight away. Uni isn't for everyone! Plus, if so inclined, \"mature\" students are incredibly common/open university etc. And in this climate \u00a313 an hour with no commitments is pretty good! My kids dad is on less than that and he's hugely qualified and experienced in his field of work! How are you with travelling single? Or 1 of those companies that does trips abroad for single/lone travellers? It seems they are completely ostracising you, which is sad. Are you social much?", "As stated - most people your age would prefer not to be around family for vacations.  This is the stage of life where you leave the nest and go find your life and identity with new experiences of your own.  I\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t want you around but rather that they\u2019re giving you space to do what twenty somethings typically do.  You might be being hard on them.  Some of us wish our parents would have trusted us that much to give us those freedoms.  Think about it that way.  The outcome of great parenting is an independent child who can cope with life without you at adulthood.  Clearly, they did a good job - or they think they did.", "How much effort are you putting in to these vacations? Did you ever look at booking the crusie yourself? You ever ask your parents for an update? When the planned date was? \n\nHave you told that you want to be included on all family vacations?\n\nYou live out the house but seem to want to spend everyday with them, which is fine, but are you just waiting on them to call you, or are you actually doing anything to be part of their plans?", "I'm a supervisor at a restaurant, pay is decent nearly \u00a313 an hour, but still a 'normal' job to them. I suppose they do think bad of it, my mum went to university got her masters in maths but my dad works manual labour. My siblings are doing really well in school where as I was very middle of the road, passed my GCSEs but very average grades", "I'd say NTA.\n\nMy family doesn't include me either usually, so I just go do stuff on my own. No friends. So I just go places by myself. Not as nice as what they get to do, but oh well, I still enjoy my time.", "NTA\n\nI would've gone no contact before this.  But is sounds like this last thing was the final straw.\n\nYou have been shown time and time again that your 'family' do not consider you to be part of it.  They don't include you in anything.  They don't even speak to you unless you contact them.\n\nWhen you were younger and still at home... were you by any chance parentified and spent a lot of time looking after your younger siblings?  And you moving out wrecked your parents free time and they are now punishing you.\n\nIf there is a big age gap between you and the next siblings...  because I would question whether you and your siblings are actually half siblings?  Or are their traits that your parents don't like about you.. like standing up for yourself and like the littler kids better because they are still under their control.\n\nBut basically you can't change your parents words, thoughts or actions.  You can only change your response to them.  You also don't owe them anything just because they are your parents.\n\nIt may be of benefit to you to see a therapist over this.  But pick one that's good with narcissism (not saying your parents are narcissists, it's just you want a therapist that won't automatically tell you that you have to make up with your parents because they are your parents but look at the full picture).\n\nAnd surround yourself with people who appreciate you and want to spend time with you ie your boyfriend, his family and your friends.  They will make you feel good about yourself... your parents do not.\n\nYour siblings may be collateral damage but you can't change that.  Whether you have contact later when they are adults depends on what your parents are saying about you and what they believe.\n\nThe best revenge is living your best life surrounded by people that care about you.  You have no obligation to your parents.  If they want your help as they age and need support... then just tell them you'll spend as much time with them as they did supporting you... and that would then be a big fat 0.", "NTA.

You offered to pay your own way for the holiday, and your family never tried to communicate with you about it getting expensive. They made the decision on your behalf, and assumed for you.\n\nThis is an all round sucky situation. I know if I had kids and my grown daughter left my house to drive back to her place crying, I\u2019d have driven after her, or at the very least phoned her.", "NTA it sounds like they\u2019ve cut you out of the family.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry.\n\nNo this is not normal. Most families have the opposite problem\u2026 demanding all their adult kids\u2019 vacation time. You are not insane to be hurt. I do not know why your family is doing this.\n\nIt sounds like you will have to build close relationships elsewhere.\n\nI am so sorry.\n\nBut I hope you can find a close friend or cousin to go on that cruise", "NTA that'd incredibly cruel of them, I have a 25 year old I always want them to come on holiday with us.   \n\nFamily holidays are special and time to make memories.", "NTA.\n\nYour family (parents really) are the AHs here.\n\nAnd you are right, they have essentially removed you from the family.\n\nQuestion - do they put much stock in what their family and friends think? \n\nIf they do, as a last parting shot before you completely block them, while they are on their current holiday make a post on social media, tag enough family etc so it gets out, and sarcastically blast them for excluding you from the family since you were 18. \n\nTheir holiday will likely be ruined, and then they will have to deal with the aftermath when they arrive back.", "NTA, simular thing happened to me and I can fully relate..it blows big time dear..It's a dick move with the whole wanting to take advantage of cheap deals remark being a load of donkey shit. It's not about going on solo holidays it's about wanting to spend time with your fam..In direct response to your question NTA. By way of advice for helping you move fwd, I'm still adjusting to my own terms so don't want to be a hypocritical guy and suggest anything that I'd not do myself. Good luck, ps you sound lovely wanting to spend time away with your family at your own expense when allot of folk your age are A )still living at home or B) on holidays with their mates instead away from family..Hope you get there xx", "Fuck them.

Exactly I can do things on my own but it's not as enjoyable, I still want to maintain contact with the people who raised me!", "Yeah I don't think they really consider me a full member of the family, it happened shortly after covid when I moved out. I actually wasn't like a 3rd parent surprisingly like a lot of people would think, maybe once every few weeks which was fine. My sister is 15 and brother is 7. But we are full siblings. It always feels like they have been favoured, they got a lot of things I didn't growing up like days out, weekends away etc. Unfortunately I yhink this is just the way it's going to be now until sibs are a lot older, esp the youngest. I doubt my sister will be this excluded when she's my age though which makes me more upset about thinking about..", "I would cut all contact with them. NTA.", "That's not the way I read it.  There appears to be some blatant favoritism going on in that household.  The younger siblings might be the favored ones.  I suspect.  I admit I could be totally wrong on that.", "Ignore this comment OP. No contact is completely valid in this scenario.", "I do sometimes regret going to uni, I'm actually considering going next year, because I am passionate about the course I want to study and was always good. I got an A* in English a level and 8 at gcse so I know I can do it, whereas everything else I was very average at. But I dont want to seem like I'm going for them\n\n Yes I'm really lucky I got in with a small family run pub brewery with generous pay they look after us well! Job security isn't there but I work 40 hour work weeks so money is good Inc tips and bonuses, but I get good holiday days as well so work has never been the issue. I don't think I could travel alone, I'm very nervous in general, even going to the cinema by myself I feel looked at and out of place never mind a new country! Maybe a company could be good, I never thought about going through something like that. I am social with co workers and my bfs friends, but I dont have my own friend group.", "If that's the case, they're making a lot of assumptions about a person who has repeatedly expressed a desire to be included, and it's not hard to just ASK if they want to join in.", "We agreed that they would book for everyone (my auntie uncle, nan and 2 nieces were going to come along) and then we would all pay my parents so that we would have cabins together, everyone woukd have the same package etc. I told them to let me know what I needed to pay. Got sent a few pics of the cruise, itinerary etc. Never heard anything about it after that.", "I don't regret going to uni at 18 but I ended up changing careers entirely in my mid twenties and having to stress about how I'd pay for a masters so I could do that. It's really sensible of you to wait until you're sure about what you want to do.\n\n\nIf you can prove you've been financially supporting yourself for the last three years then you don't need to tell your parents anything about going to university if you don't want to. It sounds like you have got a great handle on things so you've probably done this already, but it's worth making sure that you understand exactly where you stand with student finance. The system is stupid but as you're under 25 you need to prove your parents don't support you.\n\n\nIf you like where you work you could talk to them about progression routes. Would there be an opportunity for you to stay there and progress into a business or management role, or something technical? You might not want to stay there long term but it's worth considering.", "What did your aunt and nan say", "NTA, but your edit is troubling. It doesn\u2019t matter (unfortunately) that you want to be included. They aren\u2019t going to include you because they don\u2019t want you there, so the people telling you to find your own friends or travel on your own are 100% right. You\u2019ve been telling your \u201cfamily \u201c how you feel, and they don\u2019t care, so it\u2019s time to stop wasting your energy on them and try something new since that\u2019s clearly not producing the desired results.", "NTA: Before I left the country for a new job, I worked a retail one. One Christmas my family decided to go on vacation without me. They said I couldn't get off work. And they decided even if I could it wasn't worth waiting around to see. \n\nI was alone in the whole house during Christmas. I got a present as a \"make-up\". I remember making the most I could- making chili and watching some of my fave programs without judgement. \n\nBut it stung. It hurt a heck of a lot. It was lonely. And I could see their pictures and social media updates. And it hurt all over again.\n\nI've been in a different country now- across the sea. We barely talk. I tried but am used to not really getting a response. Its a cycle of blips here and there before a legit conversation then back to blips. I am planning on visiting for the first time in 6 years. In the almost decade I've been here this will be the second time I've returned \"home\". \n\nIt hurts. It happened to me only once and OP just reading how it happened to you *multiple* times brought tears to my eyes. I am so sorry. I think this is justified to freak out. My thoughts are with you. And I wish I could give you a big hug.", "NTA. It seems you are just not the favorite child.", "NTA.\nI understand you are feeling left out. This wasn't about if you could pay for yourself or not.

I would just be honest with them one last time without getting too personal and if they don't acknowledge you, then I guess you'll have to accept it.

Then you can tell your family about all the adventures you had without them.\n\nHope things work out for you OP", "NTA. My family is very close and we would go on vacations as adults. There is no excuse for them excluding you. I\u2019m sorry they are treating you this way. When they try reach out because they need something do not answer.", "Hmmmmm...... Unpopular but I would say YTA because I find it concerning that you have no friends and only a boyfriend outside your immediate family. Are you very clingy and your family would like you to have more social life outside your family group. Yes, it sucks not being included but there is no other solution that to carve your own life and experiences. Sometimes there are no reasons as to why you are being excluded and you need to protect your own mental health rather looking for answers where there may be none (since you have already tried to talk to them about this).", "Sounds like you\u2019ve upset them somehow.\n\nI tried to put myself in your parents shoes.\n\nI think they may be pissed you blew off college (I would be furious) and maybe they are taking out their anger this way.", "INFO: what was their response when you said they don't consider you anymore?", "Did your family always take many vacations? Have you considered it might be finances?  It\u2019s usually way cheaper to travel with four than five. On a cruise it\u2019s two to a room\u2014for you to go it would be a single room which is much more expensive. Your parents would need your money upfront to book it. If you can share a hotel room with your siblings it\u2019s great but otherwise it\u2019s an extra room. Rental cars are made for four\u2014otherwise it requires a much larger vehicle at more expense.  If you really can afford all the extras then great. You need to be more proactive in voicing your wanting to go with them and then really research what it would cost you. \n\nAnd I\u2019m hoping your happy but getting a college degree would be worth the extra salary in the long run.  I\u2019m sure you could probably manage online courses and work also. Alternatively look into management training within a company.", "Nta and I\u2019m so sorry op.

It can also be difficult to plan family activities with such large age gaps between the kids.

It does confirm it.", " Tell them you want to and tell them Mom and Dad don't bother asking and leave you out every time.", "Awh that's so sweet, that's all I want like u did for ur brother making him feel included even tho u know he couldn't do it.", "I'm very nervous about travelling alone. I don't really want to travel I want to holiday if u know what I mean, I don't really want to be in hostels I'm wayyy too introverted for that kind of lifestyle as lovely as it would be. I've heard of solo cruises my bfs dad is going on one so maybe I'll ask him how it is. I do like being alone so it wouldn't bother me so much but I would like the social aspect of it also .", "Did your family's circumstances change dramatically in the last 10ish years? My brother and I are 8 years apart and had wildly different childhoods due to circumstances like layoffs, parent illnesses, etc. Basically, family was in a good place when I was a kid and then dire situations when I was a teenager. It was flipped for my brother. My parents did their best for us the whole time but the things out of their control definitely had an impact on both of is differently due to our ages at the time they happened.\n\nIt seems really weird that your parents would go from supportive to this shitshow without some kind of catalyst.", "I wonder if the missing info is that the op is miserable to go on vacation with, and the rest of them want to have a good time.", "Exactly, and I promise you OP that that is not too much to ask of your family!!", "I'm really sorry, I think you're a scapegoat for something and I don't know what. No one treats their kid this way. They're deliberately mistreating you. You're wise to go NC with them. You deserve better. I hope you find your chosen family, you deserve that much. NTA Keep away from them and don't do anything for them.", "I understand how you feel. My family really sucks. I've always been the outcast but something I learned a long time ago was that family mostly just means that you can be treated like shit but is ok because you share some DNA.

No one treats their kid this way,", "They can easily plan 1 to 2 months in advance so you can ask for time off in advance.", "NTA. I'd strongly review the relationship you", "Plus remote uni... I know that people are overexaggerating the educational implications and it's perfectly fine to get educated that way, but it's meant people have done uni with no networking and no social life. Which makes the qualification basically meaningless in the job market.", "Did you pass your A-levels?", "Small group travel, like the person above mentioned.  G Adventures,  which has UK offices or Intrepid might be 2 to look into.

I got an A* in English a level and 8 at gcse so I know I can do it, whereas everything else I was very average at. But I dont want to seem like I'm going for them\n\nDon't deny yourself to spite your parents. A subject you're passionate about that will get you a good career is way more direction than I had in my (US) college experience. It's perfectly okay to not go if you don't want to, but if you think you *do* want to, don't let your parents be a factor in that decision.", "You'd be surprised, sadly.", "Yeah CCA*", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry that they seem to be cutting you out of family events.

At this point I would straight out confront your family and ask them what is going on. Something is absolutely off with them here.", "NTA. I am sorry that you are in this situation.", "Well you at least know they won\u2019t be able to turn to you for help later on.  May be a good move to go on holidays yourself.  Expand your world and experiences.  That will help shrink the room this takes up in your head and heart.", "Personally, I would not contact them. Let them contact you. If they don't, you know where you stand in your family. Sorry you have to go thru this. Also,  I don't think it will affect their holiday in the least bit.", "NTA. The same thing happened to me as a young adult, not with vacations but family get togethers. And the thing is I lived with one of my adult sisters. I\u2019d have a day off work and she would be out somewhere, and I would find out on social media or when she got home that she had been hanging out at my parents house with them or out doing something with them, and they never invited me or even checked to see if I could make it. You have every right to be upset.", "This is a problem for first born kids, as we start working or going to university we have different holidays than the younger kids and parents are often further in their careers and have more money and holidays. I've been there where you are, you told them how you felt but you need to start booking your own vacations and realize you are not going to be included. It hurts but it's how things are, so move forward and decide what you want from your family, what relationship you want to have with them. \nNTA", "You're NTA for your feelings but I do have to say that it's really hard to work 5 people into a cruise. You can fit 4 in one cabin (not every cabin will even take 4) but with 5 you do have to get two cabins or a deluxe suite. So if you had the separate cabin near theirs, you'd have been paying nearly as much for your cabin as they would have with one for 4 people.\n\nSay they have a balcony cabin. It's $1500 for the first person, $1500 for the second person, and maybe this is a special where kids sail free or sail for $150 each or something. So their expenditure for 4 people is $3000-$3300. Then you have the next cabin over, also a balcony. You'd be paying the first person's share (you), the second person's share (whether there was a second person or not, ie the dreaded 'single supplement') for a total of $3000 for 1 person!\n\nPlanned further ahead, you could have an inside across the hall from their balcony cabin (for instance), and pay less because your cabin is less posh. But would that hurt your feelings, too? It's just that the number \"5 people\" is hard to fit on cruises, if that makes sense.\n\nGreece makes no sense at all. Of course they could have and should have invited you. And frankly, pay your way.", "It\u2019s not about the trips though really, it\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re leaving her out", "Wow I'm so sorry that happened to you.

My parents paid the entire cost then the family paid my parents struagjt away (I have mentioned this on other posts bit forgot my uncle oops). It was to ensure everyone got the same package, cabins together etc. Again I was very willing to pay myself no matter because I really want to go on a Caribbean cruise and going with the people I care most about I was sooo excited. They did send me pics if the cruise and thr itinerary and after that I never heard ab it until they came back. The last thing I said was 'let me know how much I owe you and when, can't wait!!'  and that was it. I knew they were planning quite a bit in advance so never questioned it when I never heard anything for about 6 months but turns out they had already paid, been and come back without my knowing.

We all did stuff together, of course as it was just the 3 of us, and it's probably my favourite holiday to date. They planned so many things that I would like (like going to see the set of GOT, one of my favourite TV shows) and really put a lot of thought into it. We had a minor scuffle on the last day but we were fine by lunch just a normal family thing. Before that we all did stuff together, since my brother was so young like still in a pram he xoukdnt do anything specially with my dad so it would be family friendly activities but I always enjoyed it even tho I would have been much older", "Sometimes there\u2019s no reason that has anything to do with you as a person. Maybe they had a rough transition to parenting and so you\u2019re a constant reminder of those sleepless nights and things they couldn\u2019t do because they had a kid. Maybe they had a specific idea of what their kid would be like and you, being an individual, weren\u2019t \u201cto order.\u201d Maybe you look a bit too much like a relative they didn\u2019t care for. Who knows. It\u2019s their job as parents to move past all that and it\u2019s 100% on them if they don\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m another oldest child who was never good enough and left out of many family vacations and so I get it. It hurts and it\u2019s wrong what they\u2019re doing. And I wish I could say they\u2019ll change but, honestly, they probably won\u2019t. Pour yourself into building up your family of choice and making memories with them. If you can, get a therapist to help you weed through all the mess your parents left you with so you can move on to healing and living your own life quicker. \n\nAlso PLEASE don\u2019t become the kid who winds up sacrificing themselves for their parents once old age hits. I\u2019ve seen it far too often. If they wanted you as caretaker they should have taken care of you."]}
