If you have the money why on Earth are you not doing these things on your own or with a friend group?", "NTA for getting upset but YTA for going \u201cno contact.\u201d That\u2019s lame. Find your words like a big girl and talk to your parents. What you are feeling is hurt and you need to talk to them about how you feel instead of shrieking or refusing to speak to them at all. Going NC makes sense if you\u2019ve abused. Not being automatically included (as an adult) in your parents vacations doesn\u2019t rise to that level.", "Your an adult, who lives on their own. Your siblings still live at home, so they go where your parents go. \n\nTheir lives continue even when you are not there. So dinners, trips, all those things still happen. \n\nWith the cruise, did you make any effort to book it? Do any research? Ask them when they are going? Since you were paying your own way, you would have bought your own ticket. You should have been corordinating with them. \n\nIf you want to part of the daily activities they do, you have to put some work in, as you live out the house.", "NTA\n\n What if, now hear me out, you go on vacation without them. You say you haven't had any other commitments and only do work, if that has been true since 2018 then you really need one, and get this, they aren't required to be there for you to have one! And if you don't wanna go alone, perhaps invite your siblings (assuming you can pay for them). Life is too short to wait for an invite that will never come, so make your own invitations.", "I left college at 18 after my a-levels and never went to university, I was meant to do as my family are super driven on education but never ended up going at all", "Because I still want to spend time with my family. I don't have a friend group, only my boyfriend and don't particularity want to solo travel. I don't know why u would assume because I'm a young adult I don't want to go away with them", "I'm the one that maintains contact, I phone few days, my dad will phone me maybe every 2 weeks if that. I'm not going no contact I just haven't spoken to them since last night..", "NTA. That's a very unkind behaviour from your parents. I can understand why you would feel so hurt after 3 years of that treatment.", "What are you doing for work? Is it minimum wage? Does it involve physical labor? Would your family consider it \"beneath them?\" Did they have a specific idea about what you should have studied? None of this would justify their behavior obviously, but it sounds like they may think otherwise. (Sorry for so many questions)", "Loads of people don't go to uni, and with it being that you have to be in education or apprenticeship until 18 now, many people go that route after college (not uni). I mean, I personally regret not going to uni but did well in college and got a job in that field straight away. Uni isn't for everyone! Plus, if so inclined, \"mature\" students are incredibly common/open university etc. And in this climate \u00a313 an hour with no commitments is pretty good! My kids dad is on less than that and he's hugely qualified and experienced in his field of work! How are you with travelling single? Or 1 of those companies that does trips abroad for single/lone travellers? It seems they are completely ostracising you, which is sad. Are you social much?", "As stated - most people your age would prefer not to be around family for vacations.  This is the stage of life where you leave the nest and go find your life and identity with new experiences of your own.  I\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t want you around but rather that they\u2019re giving you space to do what twenty somethings typically do.  You might be being hard on them.  Some of us wish our parents would have trusted us that much to give us those freedoms.  Think about it that way.  The outcome of great parenting is an independent child who can cope with life without you at adulthood.  Clearly, they did a good job - or they think they did.", "How much effort are you putting in to these vacations? Did you ever look at booking the crusie yourself? You ever ask your parents for an update? When the planned date was? \n\nHave you told that you want to be included on all family vacations?\n\nYou live out the house but seem to want to spend everyday with them, which is fine, but are you just waiting on them to call you, or are you actually doing anything to be part of their plans?", "I'm a supervisor at a restaurant, pay is decent nearly \u00a313 an hour, but still a 'normal' job to them. I suppose they do think bad of it, my mum went to university got her masters in maths but my dad works manual labour. My siblings are doing really well in school where as I was very middle of the road, passed my GCSEs but very average grades"]}
