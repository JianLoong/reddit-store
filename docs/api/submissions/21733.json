If you have the money why on Earth are you not doing these things on your own or with a friend group?", "NTA for getting upset but YTA for going \u201cno contact.\u201d That\u2019s lame. Find your words like a big girl and talk to your parents. What you are feeling is hurt and you need to talk to them about how you feel instead of shrieking or refusing to speak to them at all. Going NC makes sense if you\u2019ve abused. Not being automatically included (as an adult) in your parents vacations doesn\u2019t rise to that level.", "Your an adult, who lives on their own. Your siblings still live at home, so they go where your parents go. \n\nTheir lives continue even when you are not there. So dinners, trips, all those things still happen. \n\nWith the cruise, did you make any effort to book it? Do any research? Ask them when they are going? Since you were paying your own way, you would have bought your own ticket. You should have been corordinating with them. \n\nIf you want to part of the daily activities they do, you have to put some work in, as you live out the house.", "NTA\n\n What if, now hear me out, you go on vacation without them. You say you haven't had any other commitments and only do work, if that has been true since 2018 then you really need one, and get this, they aren't required to be there for you to have one! And if you don't wanna go alone, perhaps invite your siblings (assuming you can pay for them). Life is too short to wait for an invite that will never come, so make your own invitations.", "I left college at 18 after my a-levels and never went to university, I was meant to do as my family are super driven on education but never ended up going at all", "Because I still want to spend time with my family. I don't have a friend group, only my boyfriend and don't particularity want to solo travel. I don't know why u would assume because I'm a young adult I don't want to go away with them", "I'm the one that maintains contact, I phone few days, my dad will phone me maybe every 2 weeks if that. I'm not going no contact I just haven't spoken to them since last night..", "NTA. That's a very unkind behaviour from your parents. I can understand why you would feel so hurt after 3 years of that treatment.", "What are you doing for work? Is it minimum wage? Does it involve physical labor? Would your family consider it \"beneath them?\" Did they have a specific idea about what you should have studied? None of this would justify their behavior obviously, but it sounds like they may think otherwise. (Sorry for so many questions)", "Loads of people don't go to uni, and with it being that you have to be in education or apprenticeship until 18 now, many people go that route after college (not uni). I mean, I personally regret not going to uni but did well in college and got a job in that field straight away. Uni isn't for everyone! Plus, if so inclined, \"mature\" students are incredibly common/open university etc. And in this climate \u00a313 an hour with no commitments is pretty good! My kids dad is on less than that and he's hugely qualified and experienced in his field of work! How are you with travelling single? Or 1 of those companies that does trips abroad for single/lone travellers? It seems they are completely ostracising you, which is sad. Are you social much?", "As stated - most people your age would prefer not to be around family for vacations.  This is the stage of life where you leave the nest and go find your life and identity with new experiences of your own.  I\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t want you around but rather that they\u2019re giving you space to do what twenty somethings typically do.  You might be being hard on them.  Some of us wish our parents would have trusted us that much to give us those freedoms.  Think about it that way.  The outcome of great parenting is an independent child who can cope with life without you at adulthood.  Clearly, they did a good job - or they think they did.", "How much effort are you putting in to these vacations? Did you ever look at booking the crusie yourself? You ever ask your parents for an update? When the planned date was? \n\nHave you told that you want to be included on all family vacations?\n\nYou live out the house but seem to want to spend everyday with them, which is fine, but are you just waiting on them to call you, or are you actually doing anything to be part of their plans?", "I'm a supervisor at a restaurant, pay is decent nearly \u00a313 an hour, but still a 'normal' job to them. I suppose they do think bad of it, my mum went to university got her masters in maths but my dad works manual labour. My siblings are doing really well in school where as I was very middle of the road, passed my GCSEs but very average grades", "I'd say NTA.\n\nMy family doesn't include me either usually, so I just go do stuff on my own. No friends. So I just go places by myself. Not as nice as what they get to do, but oh well, I still enjoy my time.", "NTA\n\nI would've gone no contact before this.  But is sounds like this last thing was the final straw.\n\nYou have been shown time and time again that your 'family' do not consider you to be part of it.  They don't include you in anything.  They don't even speak to you unless you contact them.\n\nWhen you were younger and still at home... were you by any chance parentified and spent a lot of time looking after your younger siblings?  And you moving out wrecked your parents free time and they are now punishing you.\n\nIf there is a big age gap between you and the next siblings...  because I would question whether you and your siblings are actually half siblings?  Or are their traits that your parents don't like about you.. like standing up for yourself and like the littler kids better because they are still under their control.\n\nBut basically you can't change your parents words, thoughts or actions.  You can only change your response to them.  You also don't owe them anything just because they are your parents.\n\nIt may be of benefit to you to see a therapist over this.  But pick one that's good with narcissism (not saying your parents are narcissists, it's just you want a therapist that won't automatically tell you that you have to make up with your parents because they are your parents but look at the full picture).\n\nAnd surround yourself with people who appreciate you and want to spend time with you ie your boyfriend, his family and your friends.  They will make you feel good about yourself... your parents do not.\n\nYour siblings may be collateral damage but you can't change that.  Whether you have contact later when they are adults depends on what your parents are saying about you and what they believe.\n\nThe best revenge is living your best life surrounded by people that care about you.  You have no obligation to your parents.  If they want your help as they age and need support... then just tell them you'll spend as much time with them as they did supporting you... and that would then be a big fat 0.", "NTA.   What a way to show you your parents don't give a shit about you. \nHow hurtful", "NTA fams a mess", "NTA.\n\nThose comments about you being independent and whatever don\u2019t make sense. You offered to pay your own way for the holiday, and your family never tried to communicate with you about it getting expensive. They made the decision on your behalf, and assumed for you.\n\nThis is an all round sucky situation. I know if I had kids and my grown daughter left my house to drive back to her place crying, I\u2019d have driven after her, or at the very least phoned her.", "NTA it sounds like they\u2019ve cut you out of the family.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry.\n\nNo this is not normal. Most families have the opposite problem\u2026 demanding all their adult kids\u2019 vacation time. You are not insane to be hurt. I do not know why your family is doing this.\n\nIt sounds like you will have to build close relationships elsewhere.\n\nI am so sorry.\n\nBut I hope you can find a close friend or cousin to go on that cruise", "NTA that'd incredibly cruel of them, I have a 25 year old I always want them to come on holiday with us.   \n\nFamily holidays are special and time to make memories.", "NTA.\n\nYour family (parents really) are the AHs here.\n\nAnd you are right, they have essentially removed you from the family.\n\nQuestion - do they put much stock in what their family and friends think? \n\nIf they do, as a last parting shot before you completely block them, while they are on their current holiday make a post on social media, tag enough family etc so it gets out, and sarcastically blast them for excluding you from the family since you were 18. \n\nTheir holiday will likely be ruined, and then they will have to deal with the aftermath when they arrive back.", "NTA, simular thing happened to me and I can fully relate..it blows big time dear..It's a dick move with the whole wanting to take advantage of cheap deals remark being a load of donkey shit. It's not about going on solo holidays it's about wanting to spend time with your fam..In direct response to your question NTA. By way of advice for helping you move fwd, I'm still adjusting to my own terms so don't want to be a hypocritical guy and suggest anything that I'd not do myself. Good luck, ps you sound lovely wanting to spend time away with your family at your own expense when allot of folk your age are A )still living at home or B) on holidays with their mates instead away from family..Hope you get there xx", "Fuck them. We're your family now.", "NTA", "NTA it sounds like they\u2019ve cut you out of the family.", "I can\u2019t imagine what OP\u2019s siblings must think\u2026they are next.", "Nice to have someone who is in the same situation. Exactly I can do things on my own but it's not as enjoyable, I still want to maintain contact with the people who raised me!", "Yeah I don't think they really consider me a full member of the family, it happened shortly after covid when I moved out. I actually wasn't like a 3rd parent surprisingly like a lot of people would think, maybe once every few weeks which was fine. My sister is 15 and brother is 7. But we are full siblings. It always feels like they have been favoured, they got a lot of things I didn't growing up like days out, weekends away etc. Unfortunately I yhink this is just the way it's going to be now until sibs are a lot older, esp the youngest. I doubt my sister will be this excluded when she's my age though which makes me more upset about thinking about..", "I would cut all contact with them. NTA.", "That's not the way I read it.  There appears to be some blatant favoritism going on in that household.  The younger siblings might be the favored ones.  I suspect.  I admit I could be totally wrong on that.", "Ignore this comment OP. No contact is completely valid in this scenario.", "I do sometimes regret going to uni, I'm actually considering going next year, because I am passionate about the course I want to study and was always good. I got an A* in English a level and 8 at gcse so I know I can do it, whereas everything else I was very average at. But I dont want to seem like I'm going for them\n\n Yes I'm really lucky I got in with a small family run pub brewery with generous pay they look after us well! Job security isn't there but I work 40 hour work weeks so money is good Inc tips and bonuses, but I get good holiday days as well so work has never been the issue. I don't think I could travel alone, I'm very nervous in general, even going to the cinema by myself I feel looked at and out of place never mind a new country! Maybe a company could be good, I never thought about going through something like that. I am social with co workers and my bfs friends, but I dont have my own friend group.", "If that's the case, they're making a lot of assumptions about a person who has repeatedly expressed a desire to be included, and it's not hard to just ASK if they want to join in.", "We agreed that they would book for everyone (my auntie uncle, nan and 2 nieces were going to come along) and then we would all pay my parents so that we would have cabins together, everyone woukd have the same package etc. I told them to let me know what I needed to pay. Got sent a few pics of the cruise, itinerary etc. Never heard anything about it after that.", "I don't regret going to uni at 18 but I ended up changing careers entirely in my mid twenties and having to stress about how I'd pay for a masters so I could do that. It's really sensible of you to wait until you're sure about what you want to do.\n\n\nIf you can prove you've been financially supporting yourself for the last three years then you don't need to tell your parents anything about going to university if you don't want to. It sounds like you have got a great handle on things so you've probably done this already, but it's worth making sure that you understand exactly where you stand with student finance. The system is stupid but as you're under 25 you need to prove your parents don't support you.\n\n\nIf you like where you work you could talk to them about progression routes. Would there be an opportunity for you to stay there and progress into a business or management role, or something technical? You might not want to stay there long term but it's worth considering.", "What did your aunt and nan say"]}
