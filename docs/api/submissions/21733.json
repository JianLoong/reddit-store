Find your words like a big girl and talk to your parents. What you are feeling is hurt and you need to talk to them about how you feel instead of shrieking or refusing to speak to them at all.

So dinners, trips, all those things still happen. \n\nWith the cruise, did you make any effort to book it? Do any research? Ask them when they are going? Since you were paying your own way, you would have bought your own ticket. You should have been corordinating with them. \n\nIf you want to part of the daily activities they do, you have to put some work in, as you live out the house.", "NTA\n\n What if, now hear me out, you go on vacation without them. You say you haven't had any other commitments and only do work, if that has been true since 2018 then you really need one, and get this, they aren't required to be there for you to have one! And if you don't wanna go alone, perhaps invite your siblings (assuming you can pay for them). Life is too short to wait for an invite that will never come, so make your own invitations.", "I left college at 18 after my a-levels and never went to university, I was meant to do as my family are super driven on education but never ended up going at all", "Because I still want to spend time with my family.

I'm not going no contact I just haven't spoken to them since last night..", "NTA. That's a very unkind behaviour from your parents. I can understand why you would feel so hurt after 3 years of that treatment.", "What are you doing for work? Is it minimum wage? Does it involve physical labor? Would your family consider it \"beneath them?\" Did they have a specific idea about what you should have studied? None of this would justify their behavior obviously, but it sounds like they may think otherwise. (Sorry for so many questions)", "Loads of people don't go to uni, and with it being that you have to be in education or apprenticeship until 18 now, many people go that route after college (not uni). I mean, I personally regret not going to uni but did well in college and got a job in that field straight away. Uni isn't for everyone! Plus, if so inclined, \"mature\" students are incredibly common/open university etc. And in this climate \u00a313 an hour with no commitments is pretty good! My kids dad is on less than that and he's hugely qualified and experienced in his field of work! How are you with travelling single? Or 1 of those companies that does trips abroad for single/lone travellers? It seems they are completely ostracising you, which is sad. Are you social much?", "As stated - most people your age would prefer not to be around family for vacations.  This is the stage of life where you leave the nest and go find your life and identity with new experiences of your own.  I\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t want you around but rather that they\u2019re giving you space to do what twenty somethings typically do.  You might be being hard on them.  Some of us wish our parents would have trusted us that much to give us those freedoms.  Think about it that way.  The outcome of great parenting is an independent child who can cope with life without you at adulthood.  Clearly, they did a good job - or they think they did.", "How much effort are you putting in to these vacations? Did you ever look at booking the crusie yourself? You ever ask your parents for an update? When the planned date was? \n\nHave you told that you want to be included on all family vacations?\n\nYou live out the house but seem to want to spend everyday with them, which is fine, but are you just waiting on them to call you, or are you actually doing anything to be part of their plans?", "I'm a supervisor at a restaurant, pay is decent nearly \u00a313 an hour, but still a 'normal' job to them. I suppose they do think bad of it, my mum went to university got her masters in maths but my dad works manual labour. My siblings are doing really well in school where as I was very middle of the road, passed my GCSEs but very average grades", "I'd say NTA.\n\nMy family doesn't include me either usually, so I just go do stuff on my own. No friends. So I just go places by myself. Not as nice as what they get to do, but oh well, I still enjoy my time.", "NTA\n\nI would've gone no contact before this.  But is sounds like this last thing was the final straw.\n\nYou have been shown time and time again that your 'family' do not consider you to be part of it.  They don't include you in anything.  They don't even speak to you unless you contact them.\n\nWhen you were younger and still at home... were you by any chance parentified and spent a lot of time looking after your younger siblings?  And you moving out wrecked your parents free time and they are now punishing you.\n\nIf there is a big age gap between you and the next siblings...  because I would question whether you and your siblings are actually half siblings?  Or are their traits that your parents don't like about you.. like standing up for yourself and like the littler kids better because they are still under their control.\n\nBut basically you can't change your parents words, thoughts or actions.  You can only change your response to them.  You also don't owe them anything just because they are your parents.\n\nIt may be of benefit to you to see a therapist over this.  But pick one that's good with narcissism (not saying your parents are narcissists, it's just you want a therapist that won't automatically tell you that you have to make up with your parents because they are your parents but look at the full picture).\n\nAnd surround yourself with people who appreciate you and want to spend time with you ie your boyfriend, his family and your friends.  They will make you feel good about yourself... your parents do not.\n\nYour siblings may be collateral damage but you can't change that.  Whether you have contact later when they are adults depends on what your parents are saying about you and what they believe.\n\nThe best revenge is living your best life surrounded by people that care about you.  You have no obligation to your parents.  If they want your help as they age and need support... then just tell them you'll spend as much time with them as they did supporting you... and that would then be a big fat 0.", "NTA.

You offered to pay your own way for the holiday, and your family never tried to communicate with you about it getting expensive. They made the decision on your behalf, and assumed for you.\n\nThis is an all round sucky situation.

Most families have the opposite problem\u2026 demanding all their adult kids\u2019 vacation time. You are not insane to be hurt. I do not know why your family is doing this.\n\nIt sounds like you will have to build close relationships elsewhere.\n\nI am so sorry.\n\nBut I hope you can find a close friend or cousin to go on that cruise", "NTA that'd incredibly cruel of them, I have a 25 year old I always want them to come on holiday with us.   \n\nFamily holidays are special and time to make memories.", "NTA.\n\nYour family (parents really) are the AHs here.\n\nAnd you are right, they have essentially removed you from the family.\n\nQuestion - do they put much stock in what their family and friends think? \n\nIf they do, as a last parting shot before you completely block them, while they are on their current holiday make a post on social media, tag enough family etc so it gets out, and sarcastically blast them for excluding you from the family since you were 18. \n\nTheir holiday will likely be ruined, and then they will have to deal with the aftermath when they arrive back.", "NTA, simular thing happened to me and I can fully relate..it blows big time dear..It's a dick move with the whole wanting to take advantage of cheap deals remark being a load of donkey shit. It's not about going on solo holidays it's about wanting to spend time with your fam..In direct response to your question NTA. By way of advice for helping you move fwd, I'm still adjusting to my own terms so don't want to be a hypocritical guy and suggest anything that I'd not do myself. Good luck, ps you sound lovely wanting to spend time away with your family at your own expense when allot of folk your age are A )still living at home or B) on holidays with their mates instead away from family..Hope you get there xx", "Fuck them.

Exactly I can do things on my own but it's not as enjoyable, I still want to maintain contact with the people who raised me!", "Yeah I don't think they really consider me a full member of the family, it happened shortly after covid when I moved out. I actually wasn't like a 3rd parent surprisingly like a lot of people would think, maybe once every few weeks which was fine. My sister is 15 and brother is 7. But we are full siblings. It always feels like they have been favoured, they got a lot of things I didn't growing up like days out, weekends away etc. Unfortunately I yhink this is just the way it's going to be now until sibs are a lot older, esp the youngest. I doubt my sister will be this excluded when she's my age though which makes me more upset about thinking about..", "I would cut all contact with them. NTA.", "That's not the way I read it.  There appears to be some blatant favoritism going on in that household.  The younger siblings might be the favored ones.  I suspect.  I admit I could be totally wrong on that.", "Ignore this comment OP. No contact is completely valid in this scenario.", "I do sometimes regret going to uni, I'm actually considering going next year, because I am passionate about the course I want to study and was always good. I got an A* in English a level and 8 at gcse so I know I can do it, whereas everything else I was very average at. But I dont want to seem like I'm going for them\n\n Yes I'm really lucky I got in with a small family run pub brewery with generous pay they look after us well! Job security isn't there but I work 40 hour work weeks so money is good Inc tips and bonuses, but I get good holiday days as well so work has never been the issue. I don't think I could travel alone, I'm very nervous in general, even going to the cinema by myself I feel looked at and out of place never mind a new country! Maybe a company could be good, I never thought about going through something like that. I am social with co workers and my bfs friends, but I dont have my own friend group.", "If that's the case, they're making a lot of assumptions about a person who has repeatedly expressed a desire to be included, and it's not hard to just ASK if they want to join in.", "We agreed that they would book for everyone (my auntie uncle, nan and 2 nieces were going to come along) and then we would all pay my parents so that we would have cabins together, everyone woukd have the same package etc. I told them to let me know what I needed to pay. Got sent a few pics of the cruise, itinerary etc. Never heard anything about it after that.", "I don't regret going to uni at 18 but I ended up changing careers entirely in my mid twenties and having to stress about how I'd pay for a masters so I could do that. It's really sensible of you to wait until you're sure about what you want to do.\n\n\nIf you can prove you've been financially supporting yourself for the last three years then you don't need to tell your parents anything about going to university if you don't want to. It sounds like you have got a great handle on things so you've probably done this already, but it's worth making sure that you understand exactly where you stand with student finance. The system is stupid but as you're under 25 you need to prove your parents don't support you.\n\n\nIf you like where you work you could talk to them about progression routes. Would there be an opportunity for you to stay there and progress into a business or management role, or something technical? You might not want to stay there long term but it's worth considering.", "What did your aunt and nan say", "NTA, but your edit is troubling. It doesn\u2019t matter (unfortunately) that you want to be included. They aren\u2019t going to include you because they don\u2019t want you there, so the people telling you to find your own friends or travel on your own are 100% right. You\u2019ve been telling your \u201cfamily \u201c how you feel, and they don\u2019t care, so it\u2019s time to stop wasting your energy on them and try something new since that\u2019s clearly not producing the desired results.", "NTA: Before I left the country for a new job, I worked a retail one. One Christmas my family decided to go on vacation without me. They said I couldn't get off work. And they decided even if I could it wasn't worth waiting around to see. \n\nI was alone in the whole house during Christmas. I got a present as a \"make-up\". I remember making the most I could- making chili and watching some of my fave programs without judgement. \n\nBut it stung. It hurt a heck of a lot. It was lonely. And I could see their pictures and social media updates. And it hurt all over again.\n\nI've been in a different country now- across the sea. We barely talk. I tried but am used to not really getting a response. Its a cycle of blips here and there before a legit conversation then back to blips. I am planning on visiting for the first time in 6 years. In the almost decade I've been here this will be the second time I've returned \"home\". \n\nIt hurts. It happened to me only once and OP just reading how it happened to you *multiple* times brought tears to my eyes. I am so sorry. I think this is justified to freak out. My thoughts are with you. And I wish I could give you a big hug.", "NTA. It seems you are just not the favorite child.", "NTA.\nI understand you are feeling left out. This wasn't about if you could pay for yourself or not.

I would just be honest with them one last time without getting too personal and if they don't acknowledge you, then I guess you'll have to accept it.

Then you can tell your family about all the adventures you had without them.\n\nHope things work out for you OP", "NTA. My family is very close and we would go on vacations as adults. There is no excuse for them excluding you. I\u2019m sorry they are treating you this way. When they try reach out because they need something do not answer.", "Hmmmmm...... Unpopular but I would say YTA because I find it concerning that you have no friends and only a boyfriend outside your immediate family. Are you very clingy and your family would like you to have more social life outside your family group. Yes, it sucks not being included but there is no other solution that to carve your own life and experiences. Sometimes there are no reasons as to why you are being excluded and you need to protect your own mental health rather looking for answers where there may be none (since you have already tried to talk to them about this).", "Sounds like you\u2019ve upset them somehow.\n\nI tried to put myself in your parents shoes.\n\nI think they may be pissed you blew off college (I would be furious) and maybe they are taking out their anger this way.", "INFO: what was their response when you said they don't consider you anymore?", "Did your family always take many vacations? Have you considered it might be finances?  It\u2019s usually way cheaper to travel with four than five. On a cruise it\u2019s two to a room\u2014for you to go it would be a single room which is much more expensive. Your parents would need your money upfront to book it. If you can share a hotel room with your siblings it\u2019s great but otherwise it\u2019s an extra room. Rental cars are made for four\u2014otherwise it requires a much larger vehicle at more expense.  If you really can afford all the extras then great. You need to be more proactive in voicing your wanting to go with them and then really research what it would cost you. \n\nAnd I\u2019m hoping your happy but getting a college degree would be worth the extra salary in the long run.  I\u2019m sure you could probably manage online courses and work also. Alternatively look into management training within a company.", "Nta and I\u2019m so sorry op.

Unfortunately it was a while ago now tho I try not to dread on it, it happening last night again but without my knowledge is worse I think", "Yes that first bit is exactly the same as me!!! Without even asking 'we thought u could get the time off'. It sucks, especially when you see it on socials. I wanted to holiday with my family and make memories, which some people dont seem to understand I want to see the world, but I dont want to travel like sleeping in a hostel with 5 other people or going around on sleeper trains I want holiday, like to stay in hotels and see the tourists sights, which is what a family holiday is meant to be.\n\nBut I'm so sorry that happened to you also, espically during Christmas time that would hurt like hell. Thank you for your kindness and understanding. I hope you enjoy your trip back <3 I also shed a tear reading your response, but I'm glad there's someone who has experienced the same. :)", "I'm sorry to hear that, it's awful but at least we're not alone", "Worth some thought.", "I used to have a friendship group of 4 from school, it was about a year ago 2 of them moved in together, I wasn't asked but wouldnt have done it anyway. They then got their boyfriends in with them and after that I was no longer invited out, I'd ask them to go for drinks and occasionally they would but not frequently... \nI think a lot of people coming into their 20s have the same experiences, losing friends as I know I'm not the only one out there. I love them and that's why I want to spend time with them, we were all very close at one point.", "I think that's a really unfair thing to do, i told them from the start I was unsure applied anyway, got in and changed my mind.

But there was a point where I realized it didn't mean that much to them. Yeah, that's a bit painful, but nothing I can't handle. They're the ones missing out, imo. \n\nPersonally, I think I'm a pretty fun person to vacation with, so it's their loss.", "You sound a bit entitled honestly but I understand your point of view so maybe you should've handled the situation better.", "I'm sorry that you're in this situation, it sounds very hurtful. Sadly, it doesn't seem like your parents care about you. I'm sure it's really difficult, but it might be best to start building a life without them to save yourself from further hurt. Their behaviour demonstrates that they don't even feel bad about it. Sometimes family isn't what e would want it to be. \n\nAlso, are you sure you're not adopted? Maybe your parents thought that they couldn't have kids at first. I know this sounds a bit crazy, but your parents behaviour is just so hard to understand.", "Nta. With the age gap your parents likely earn more money than when you were little which can  explain why they do more activites now. Also, a lot of deals are 2 adults, 2 kids, so it would have cost more (maybe substantially more) for the 5 of you to go. It can also be difficult to plan family activities with such large age gaps between the kids. After the lockdowns, your parents may have realised how much they missed out on, so they made the decision to do more family things (which doesn't explain why you're excluded). Those aren't excuses for treating you poorly, though. But are perhaps possible reasons that they should communicate.\n\nYou might find that with your sister having exams (gcse's &a-levels) they travel less, do less activities over the next few years.\n\nPrior to you moving out at 18, did the family travel? Were there any major changes like promotions, new jobs, and wf,  which cut a long (expensive/tiring) commute?\n\nWere they upset you moved out at 18? Why did you move out? Are you the one who always initiated a contact, or do they reach out to you regularly?\n\nI think you should go low contact with your parents ,at least for a while. Keep in touch with your sister (and brother). when you're talking to your sister, say \"is brother around, hand him the phone and chat for a few minutes.\" Take your sister out, invite her over. Your brother too if possible.\n\nFocus on making your world bigger and making connections. Find a group hobby/activity and make a friend or 2 it will take time and effort. Learn pottry or french or how to bake bread. You want to travel, so travel! Find an organised tour/holiday for solo travellers and go and make friends.

Everyone wants to be part of a group. And the safest group should be your own family. I hope you will be able to talk to them about it.

I know it\u2019s not much but here is a digital hug <3", "I am so confused about why they are pushing you away. Most parents would be thrilled to have their adult children attend family vacations and other functions. I wonder if they just never actually wanted kids and will do the same to your siblings when they move out, so they can get back to being just a couple?", "[removed]", "Yeah, I think they are punishing you by excluding you till you go back to uni.

Yes my family has always gone on holidays, but jt was always Spain, Turkey the usual but since lockdown they got a lot more expensive like New York, Iceland and of course the one that gets me the most the luxury Caribbean cruise. I will maintain contact with my sis, I still want to see her the most we developed a close relationship and she's at the age she needs advice and I want to give her the best. \n\nI wasn't aware there was companies that organised solo traveller holidays so it's defo something I will look at because it seems easier then going it alone espicslly when I've never booked my own holiday!", "It started slowly but I noticed it most this Christmas, I didn't even get s gift.

NTA.", "NTA\n\nbut consider: if you were coming to this post and reading about someone else's family, would you think these were people the OP would want to spend extended time with in a foreign place?  If the answer is no... why do you want to spend extended time with these people in a foreign place?", "Nta. They are clearly and repeatedly excluding you purposefully. I\u2019m so sorry. I would not even try to have a relationship with my parents if this is how they acted. You don\u2019t deserve this and it isn\u2019t your fault. What atrocious behavior. \nMy best advice is keep focusing on your own life, creating the career and healthy relationships you deserve. Read Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents. Join some outing or travel clubs/ there are lots of people out there looking for people to travel with! Your partner is a recent one but whether they stay or go, you still need to build your own community of friends who support, respect, appreciate and genuinely care for each other.", "NTA. \n\nWhichever is the more reasonable and honest parent, i would take them out to dinner and ask whats happening. Ask if you have disappointed them in someway. Really take ownership of the situation(i know that isnt fair, but it is effective at getting to the root of an issue)\n\nAsk them how they would feel in your shoes. Once you get an answer as to why, then you can process and solution hunt. I wish you the best of luck. This has to be very hurtful but will potentially be a good process of healing and growth after its all said and done", "Ugh, this is such a painful situation. Made all the more painful because by not even bothering to contact you, your parents are essentially affirming your argument. I completely understand that you want to be part of your family and family events. They seem to have a transactional view of family life where you once you become an adult and start your own life, you cease to exist. I'm sorry.\n\nI would hope they come to their senses. If not, I can only advise you that hand-built families are great too. Find your tribe and build up ties with the people around you. \n\nAgain, I'm sorry. NTA", "I'm sorry they're behaving so cruelly. They're not into you. NTA", "I'm 40 years old and make more money than my three siblings combined and it still stings when I get left out of family events. It has nothing to do with age or income sweetheart. You're putting more into the relationship than they are and that hurts. \n\nI love my nieces and nephews so much though that I plan a week-long Camp Aunt Boomdeeyada every summer with all the kids. It keeps me involved in their lives, they know I love them, and I feel really connected to family in the way I need to. \n\nNow that this realization has hit, you'll grieve, but then think about how you can redesign your Family. That could be extended family, younger siblings, friends... And then start creating your own traditions. Leave the big complicated holidays like Christmas alone, but maybe have a cookie baking tradition a few weeks prior. Or have a Snow Party in January. Get creative and have fun. You can still have Family on your terms in ways that are not so painful.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry your family only sees the nuclear family as those living under the same roof.  I am sure if hurts tremendously, especially since your own social circle is small.\n\nUnfortunately you can not change another person.  The mere fact that they didn't really argue about it or reach out to clear this up speaks volumes.\n\nYou don't want to hear \"go on your own holidays\" which is understandable, but unfortunately, you are going to have to start making your own chosen family, because it sounds like your family has pretty much moved on.  \n\nIt is their loss and I am sure they will realize eventually, but you need to look out for yourself.\n\nTry making friends and acquaintances where you work/have hobbies and hopefully by the next holiday season, you will feel welcomed where you will be cherished.", "NTA\nSorry that your family are just dicks.\nThat's really messed up.", "NTA. I'm sorry to say, but since they didn't reach out to you I am afraid you were right.. Weird for parents not to start calling the moment you are out of sight in these cases. \n\nTo be honoust, if you really do want to be part again you'll have to talk to them. No real other choice than that. You kind of didn't give  them a chance to respond, you'll need that to go further. Might end up in more dissapointment, but no talking won't bring progress if that's your goal.", "NTA\nI'm so sorry you are going through this OP, it sounds really hard to be rejected like that from family.
