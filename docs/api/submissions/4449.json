What SIL *thought* she found was definitely worth getting distraught over, but her reaction was a little excessive. That said, I think it's perfectly reasonable to not think to mention \"by the way, I taxidermied my dog\" especially if he's taking his final snooze in an office or room that doesn't sound like a common area. If they hadn't overreacted, I'd say this was a N A H situation. As it is though I'd say they're TA.

You would not be at all out of line for refusing to pay for a hotel room for them.", "NAH\n\nI mean, you should have warned them, as a courtesy.

In my family we've already agreed our dog is getting stuffed and mounted over the mantle when he dies so he can stay with us.

I empathize with how hard it is when we lose our pets, because they're part of our family.\n\nNow that I established how important pets are in my eyes, I have to say: I would freak out if I thought I noticed your dog had just died before you did. Even moreso knowing you lost one within the last year or two. It would take me a little while to get my emotions under control again.\n\nI don't think you deserve to be berated by the rest of the family though.

It might be good though to get some sort of plaque or display thing for Franco, just to make it more clear that he's taxidermied.", "NTA and what? They are guilting you out of something in your home?

I\u2019m less a pet person (the fur, the mess, the effort are not my thing) so honestly this would absolutely crack me up. \n\nBut I find a lot of people really dislike and get \u2018the ick\u2019 on taxidermy generally. It\u2019s very love or hate and rarely middle ground meh. And as pets increasingly reach \u2018fur baby\u2019 status for many the idea of taxidermying a family member weirds them out no end to the point of feeling like a descretation.\n\nI had two friends fall out in spectacular fashion when both as pet owners they lost their elderly pets in the same few months. Cat friend opted not to keep any token of remains and loves taxidermy generally. Dog friend had ashes made into jewellery, asked us to lie on the bed while the dog was euthanised to pass energies while he passed and then slept with the dog for 48 hours after death, groomed him, did last rites and generally they handled traumatic losses quite differently. Cat friend and I did not know about the dog death slumber party side and thought we were bringing wine and sympathy. We definitely were not able to hide the reaction to being involved.\n\nDog friend accused cat friend of being the type to stuff her cat like some sick trophy or throw \u2018it\u2019 in the trash because she was into taxidermy which is animal abuse and disrespectful to the dead, family and her religion. Cat friend oddly is vegan while dog friend is not. It got into insinuations of ritual sacrifice (I shit you not) and Dog Friend turned out to be very anti anything that seemed witchcraft adjacent. I discovered a lot of people feel like this about taxidermy and that it gives bad or malevolent energy. Knock me down, I thought the worst aspect was moths.\n\nLearned even posting it on social media can get hella strong responses. I don\u2019t get it but yes people will avoid being around it especially at night out of whole almost ghost story/horror fears. I had a taxidermy squirrel dressed as Superman and people *lost their shit* to the point of screaming. I had to start checking a near trigger warning when hosting ( plot twist, I am the one with PTSD\u2026)\n\nAnd honestly she is probably so incredibly mortified she peed herself she cannot look anyone in the eye. If she\u2019s a pet person who got a real \u2018worse case fear\u2019 shock, or has anxieties or phobias this triggered without warning she can get crazy shame for the phobia responses when she was off guard. I have a really bad phobia and have had tonnes of therapy but I am so could vomit with embarrassment if caught unawares and go into full phobia reaction because it is so humiliating and well silly to most people. It\u2019s linked to my PTSD but hard to explain and honestly having yes pissed myself in fear at it I would rather pay for a hotel than risk having to face \u2018judgement\u2019 until I\u2019ve handled how incredibly vulnerable and degraded I feel by having a phobia like that as a grown up woman.\n\nI am usually fine just looking a bit daft if it comes up expectedly. I can have humour about it them but sometimes the shame spiral bores to the core of the earth.\n\nNAH.
