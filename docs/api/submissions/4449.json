I work from home but I work for myself so I told them if they needed me they could knock and I would tell them if it was okay to come in.  \n\nMy SIL knocked and I told her to come in.

But my parents and my brother are taking her side.

What SIL *thought* she found was definitely worth getting distraught over, but her reaction was a little excessive. That said, I think it's perfectly reasonable to not think to mention \"by the way, I taxidermied my dog\" especially if he's taking his final snooze in an office or room that doesn't sound like a common area. If they hadn't overreacted, I'd say this was a N A H situation. As it is though I'd say they're TA. Your SIL may be embarrassed but she needs to take a leaf out of Franco's book and calm down and nap it off. You would not be at all out of line for refusing to pay for a hotel room for them.", "NAH\n\nI mean, you should have warned them, as a courtesy.

Would she run off to stay at a hotel if you walked around a corner at night and she peed because she thought it was a burglar? Ridiculous.

In my family we've already agreed our dog is getting stuffed and mounted over the mantle when he dies so he can stay with us.

I\u2019m less a pet person (the fur, the mess, the effort are not my thing) so honestly this would absolutely crack me up. \n\nBut I find a lot of people really dislike and get \u2018the ick\u2019 on taxidermy generally. It\u2019s very love or hate and rarely middle ground meh. And as pets increasingly reach \u2018fur baby\u2019 status for many the idea of taxidermying a family member weirds them out no end to the point of feeling like a descretation.\n\nI had two friends fall out in spectacular fashion when both as pet owners they lost their elderly pets in the same few months. Cat friend opted not to keep any token of remains and loves taxidermy generally. Dog friend had ashes made into jewellery, asked us to lie on the bed while the dog was euthanised to pass energies while he passed and then slept with the dog for 48 hours after death, groomed him, did last rites and generally they handled traumatic losses quite differently. Cat friend and I did not know about the dog death slumber party side and thought we were bringing wine and sympathy. We definitely were not able to hide the reaction to being involved.\n\nDog friend accused cat friend of being the type to stuff her cat like some sick trophy or throw \u2018it\u2019 in the trash because she was into taxidermy which is animal abuse and disrespectful to the dead, family and her religion. Cat friend oddly is vegan while dog friend is not. It got into insinuations of ritual sacrifice (I shit you not) and Dog Friend turned out to be very anti anything that seemed witchcraft adjacent. I discovered a lot of people feel like this about taxidermy and that it gives bad or malevolent energy. Knock me down, I thought the worst aspect was moths.\n\nLearned even posting it on social media can get hella strong responses. I don\u2019t get it but yes people will avoid being around it especially at night out of whole almost ghost story/horror fears. I had a taxidermy squirrel dressed as Superman and people *lost their shit* to the point of screaming. I had to start checking a near trigger warning when hosting ( plot twist, I am the one with PTSD\u2026)\n\nAnd honestly she is probably so incredibly mortified she peed herself she cannot look anyone in the eye. If she\u2019s a pet person who got a real \u2018worse case fear\u2019 shock, or has anxieties or phobias this triggered without warning she can get crazy shame for the phobia responses when she was off guard. I have a really bad phobia and have had tonnes of therapy but I am so could vomit with embarrassment if caught unawares and go into full phobia reaction because it is so humiliating and well silly to most people. It\u2019s linked to my PTSD but hard to explain and honestly having yes pissed myself in fear at it I would rather pay for a hotel than risk having to face \u2018judgement\u2019 until I\u2019ve handled how incredibly vulnerable and degraded I feel by having a phobia like that as a grown up woman.\n\nI am usually fine just looking a bit daft if it comes up expectedly. I can have humour about it them but sometimes the shame spiral bores to the core of the earth.\n\nNAH.

It's unfortunately quite high in abandoned neonate kittens. The upside is if you get lucky and can nurse one back to health they are always very special and wonderful kitties. You can find no closer bond.", "Lol well if you want training tips let me know! It's a lot of fun imo", "The youngest kitten I\u2019ve ever interacted with was 2 months. At the shelter I volunteered at, they only let staff in the kitten/maternity wards because they didn\u2019t want vulnerable moms and kittens to catch anything so this is the first I\u2019m hearing about it.", "We do a lot of fostering of cats. It\u2019s super rewarding. Just failed with one of them and she is staying forever.", "The youngest I cared for was a litter of 3 that were only a few hours old. Some firemen had found a garbage bag with them inside and brought them to us. Unfortunately one passed the 1st night, the second made it 9 days. The third thankfully survived and was adopted out. We cared for quite a few litters that were a week or so old as well. It's so incredibly difficult to care for kittens so young, they need round the clock feeding and cleaning, the right temperatures etc. You don't get any sleep. I much preferred to trap and socialize feral adults, it's surprisingly much easier.", "It's weird to be so scared of a dead animal that you scream and run away and pee. I can understand being shocked, or upset, or disgusted, but frightened to the point of running away and pissing yourself seems really odd to me. But whatever, I guess you can't always control your initial reaction to things. \n\nNTA, it's odd but not unheard of, and that cannot be the first taxidermied animal she has ever seen. She needs to take a walk and chill. \n\nI've have wanted to taxidermy pets in the past but was never able to afford it when the time came. The money always goes to their quality of life first, and when they are old and not in pain they can still cost a lot in meds and vet visits.", "LOL, NTA. To each their own.", "Good to know I wasn\u2019t the only one laughing at the SIL\u2019s reaction. \ud83d\ude08 Do I like the idea of stuffed dog? No but I get it. I have a almost life sized portrait of my cat that passed that brings me comfort. (You can get pictures printed on canvas for pretty cheap!)", "[deleted]", "This is probably the best thing I've read all day. Love your weirdness!", "I almost spit out my food \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 this is some shitI would do.", "We want Fred!", "NTA but all I can think about is Rowdy from Scrubs and how freaked out anyone who entered the apartment was.", "That\u2019s weird as fuck no offense.  But NTA", "NTA but who shoos a sleeping dog off the couch? Let him sleep, he was there first! Eesh.", "Ohhhh. It was a terrible job. He looked like a skinny dingo looking thing"]}
