What SIL *thought* she found was definitely worth getting distraught over, but her reaction was a little excessive. That said, I think it's perfectly reasonable to not think to mention \"by the way, I taxidermied my dog\" especially if he's taking his final snooze in an office or room that doesn't sound like a common area. If they hadn't overreacted, I'd say this was a N A H situation. As it is though I'd say they're TA. Your SIL may be embarrassed but she needs to take a leaf out of Franco's book and calm down and nap it off. You would not be at all out of line for refusing to pay for a hotel room for them.", "NAH\n\nI mean, you should have warned them, as a courtesy.

Would she run off to stay at a hotel if you walked around a corner at night and she peed because she thought it was a burglar? Ridiculous.

In my family we've already agreed our dog is getting stuffed and mounted over the mantle when he dies so he can stay with us.

I\u2019m less a pet person (the fur, the mess, the effort are not my thing) so honestly this would absolutely crack me up. \n\nBut I find a lot of people really dislike and get \u2018the ick\u2019 on taxidermy generally. It\u2019s very love or hate and rarely middle ground meh. And as pets increasingly reach \u2018fur baby\u2019 status for many the idea of taxidermying a family member weirds them out no end to the point of feeling like a descretation.\n\nI had two friends fall out in spectacular fashion when both as pet owners they lost their elderly pets in the same few months. Cat friend opted not to keep any token of remains and loves taxidermy generally. Dog friend had ashes made into jewellery, asked us to lie on the bed while the dog was euthanised to pass energies while he passed and then slept with the dog for 48 hours after death, groomed him, did last rites and generally they handled traumatic losses quite differently. Cat friend and I did not know about the dog death slumber party side and thought we were bringing wine and sympathy. We definitely were not able to hide the reaction to being involved.\n\nDog friend accused cat friend of being the type to stuff her cat like some sick trophy or throw \u2018it\u2019 in the trash because she was into taxidermy which is animal abuse and disrespectful to the dead, family and her religion. Cat friend oddly is vegan while dog friend is not. It got into insinuations of ritual sacrifice (I shit you not) and Dog Friend turned out to be very anti anything that seemed witchcraft adjacent. I discovered a lot of people feel like this about taxidermy and that it gives bad or malevolent energy. Knock me down, I thought the worst aspect was moths.\n\nLearned even posting it on social media can get hella strong responses. I don\u2019t get it but yes people will avoid being around it especially at night out of whole almost ghost story/horror fears. I had a taxidermy squirrel dressed as Superman and people *lost their shit* to the point of screaming. I had to start checking a near trigger warning when hosting ( plot twist, I am the one with PTSD\u2026)\n\nAnd honestly she is probably so incredibly mortified she peed herself she cannot look anyone in the eye. If she\u2019s a pet person who got a real \u2018worse case fear\u2019 shock, or has anxieties or phobias this triggered without warning she can get crazy shame for the phobia responses when she was off guard. I have a really bad phobia and have had tonnes of therapy but I am so could vomit with embarrassment if caught unawares and go into full phobia reaction because it is so humiliating and well silly to most people. It\u2019s linked to my PTSD but hard to explain and honestly having yes pissed myself in fear at it I would rather pay for a hotel than risk having to face \u2018judgement\u2019 until I\u2019ve handled how incredibly vulnerable and degraded I feel by having a phobia like that as a grown up woman.\n\nI am usually fine just looking a bit daft if it comes up expectedly.

Don't pay for the hotel, this is a total overreaction.\n\nSaying that as someone who has her Guinea pigs skeleton articulated and say next to her favourite toy.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I probably wouldn't do the same, but holy shit that was funny.", "Alan alda has a great book based on his taxidermied dog", "NTA. People are so unnecessarily dramatic.", "NTA, that is hilarious. Probably should have gave them a heads up though. No, you should not be expected to help pay for their stay elsewhere. They can either stay out of the office and away from your stuffed pup or go somewhere else on their expense.", "NTA It\u2019s Weird and Funny", "ESH - yeah when she went to sit on the couch you should have said something. I would have freaked out at first too if I didn\u2019t know. They suck for asking you to pay for the hotel.", "Ok, let's all calm down. Lots of people taxidermy animals or their heads. It was on the couch in your office so not exactly public. And it's your home and choice. It's different but not that big  a deal.\n\nThey can go to a hotel if they choose but you are not required to pay for it. Your sister seems a bit emotional. Even if she found a dog dead.on your couch, her reaction seems extreme but, hey, different folks- different strokes.\n\nNTA", "How has nobody brought up The Hotel New Hampshire yet?\n\nNTA and tell SIL to get a grip. Just put some newspaper down for her and everything will be fine.", "NTA it is weird but who cares", "NTA, what you did is unusual, but you do you.", "NTA, tbf she did it to herself. If she didn't try to chase the dog off the couch she wouldn't have even noticed", "NTA and us Kiwis are generally laid back and would see the funny side.", "NTA. This is pure comedy!!", "NTA, people need to stop being weird about death.", "NAH (except for where brother & SIL demand you to chip in for a hotel room.) I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. However, you did accidentally traumatized your SIL. Because let\u2019s be real, who would immediately assume Franco is taxidermied. Of course the natural conclusion to jump to is that one of your Poms died. I think it would make everyone feel better if you apologize sincerely and empathetically. An apology doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re at fault, but acknowledging that an unfortunate event occurred due to timing and circumstance.", "NTA, it's your beloved puppy and that's a great way to memorialize a pet. Other people shouldn't have input into that, and if it freaks them out, that's on them. I'm hoping to have my cat's articulated skeleton mounted when he passes away, or at least keep his skull. That's going to weird my mom the fuck out, but this cat means everything to me and I want to keep him in my life when he's gone. It will be immensely comforting to me to have his spooky little skellington around.", "A little weird, but definitely NTA for it.", "You didn\u2019t notice that someone was about sit down next to your dead dog.  Sure.", "I have 2 cockatiels in my freezer waiting to be buried. One died just this last October, but the other one has been there for years.\n\nI need to clean out my freezer more often.", "I mean,you didn't mean to scare her. I don't want to judge you as an asshole, but having your dog taxidermied is something I can never understand. I have cats,not dogs,but I couldn't imagine doing that to them anymore than I could imagine doing that to a human relative I just lost.  It's just disturbing to me.  But NTA,I guess.", "Gonna recommend Good Grief by E.B. Bartels. She write about how we grieve pets. The short of it is that we don\u2019t have standard cultural practices for how we mourn our dead pests, but we can more then as or more deeply than the people in our lives. \n\nThere\u2019s a section on taxidermy.", "Same. I cried a little laughing.", "We can only hope your wife loves you as much.", "A warning isn't even necessary. It's OPs house, OPs office. If she wants to decorate her office with canopic jars and have her dead dog mummified in there that's  her space and she is allowed to (if mummification is legal where she lives).\n\nNow, I think it's strange, but so is kicking a dog off a couch you don't own without the owner telling you to, and so is yelling and running from the room when you think a dog died on the couch instead of telling the owner something is wrong. The SIL is a major 6 for not expressing any concern for the dog, trying to boot it off the couch, and for expecting to have a hotel room paid for because she doesn't like OPs decor....", "yeah that\u2019s weird to me, just sit on the other end of the couch if that was her intention. and her reaction to what she thought was op\u2019s dead dog is really over the top, to scream in horror when she thought she was the first to discover the dead body of a beloved pet. i guess she couldn\u2019t help that reaction in the moment but damn.", "I think in some ways, at least for myself, the question of whether feels okay to taxidermy a beloved pet comes back around to the issue of how distantly removed we are from the animals we eat. Because I was raised with a huge cognitive disconnect between live animals and the meat I eat, the concept of an animal I love becoming a dead thing that can be cut up and skinned is just unbearable to even think about. But if someone lives in a culture or situation where they kill and/or butcher the animals they eat with their own hands, that connection likely feels much more natural and much less upsetting even when it applies to an animal they live with and love (and obviously there are still people who don't feel that kind of upset around taxidermy pets even if they don't hunt or butcher).\n\nI absolutely could not have my dog skinned and mounted, or turned into a rug, or mittens, or anything like that. To me, it would feel like betraying her by treating her like an object. But at the same time I really empathize with a story of a family member generations back who'd ride in their carriage pulled by the same beloved horse to church every Sunday...and when that horse died, they had it skinned and turned the pelt into a lap blanket to keep them warm on future rides. I get it. It makes sense, even if I wouldn't do it myself. That horse stayed with them for years after its death and I bet that was really comforting and helped them remember the animal fondly.", "Why should he have, it's in his office, on his couch, in his house. Should someone have to warn me they have a 12 point buck mounted on the wall? Little different, yes but same concept, someone may get scared thinking the buck busted through the wall and was going to rampage through the house.", "The fact that you Weekend at Bernies a dog just makes my day", "It was very popular to do with favored dogs during the Victorian era. Victorians taxidermied everything.\n\nI have a friend who recently lost a dog unexpectedly (she had a necropsy done, Chagas disease!). She also happens to do taxidermy and preservation as a weird hobby. She chose to do something with him. She just got his pelt back from a friend who did the preparation for her.", "I'd put some holly and bells on him and move him around each night like Elf on the Shelf. But I've always been known as the weird one", "I\u2019d probably have had a heart attack trying to pet the dog \ud83d\ude02 Can you imagine thinking you found a family member\u2019s dog died while in the room with them??", "I\u2019m dying laughing and she\u2019s an idiot! Wanna be friends?", "Nah if an animal in someone else's house is taking up seating space I'll sit my own ass on the floor and I have", "You.  I like you.  This sounds insane and hilarious.    \n\n\nWe as a family stayed at a Air BnB cabin one year over 4th of july.  They had a bear skin rug that kind of freaked out my teenager.  So the entire family took to moving it around when teenager wasn't there or was sleeping, so that they never knew quite where it was, and it was always good for an \"I hate you\" :)  \n\n\nNote teenager was ok with this, and played along, just didn't like the bear looking at her.  So obviously every morning the bear was peering over the edge of her bed", "Dog on the Log. He will bark and let Santa know if your naughty or nice.", "This is freaking HILARIOUS and I can't stop laughing. I ADORE this idea. Take my poor persons gold, \ud83e\udd47 you hilarious wonderful person", "These comments are reminding me of when the last of my gerbils died earlier this year. After my housemate came home and she was kind enough to talk with me about how I was feeling, she very carefully broached the topic:\n\n\"Uh, this is kind of an indelicate question, but...where is Friday now? Like, physically?\"\n\nThe answer was that I'd already found a little box for her and put her in the mini-freezer with my snake's feeder rats (I buy pre-killed, frozen rats in bulk once or twice per year). It's quite a drive to the exotics vet where I'd taken the gerbil for check-ups as her health declined in her old age, so she stayed in the freezer for about a month, until I needed to take my rabbit for a check-up and dropped her off for cremation while I was there. \n\nAnd yeah, I'm painfully aware of the cognitive dissonance in having a pet gerbil cherished enough that I paid to have her cremated while I also have a freezer full of dead rats that are just food for another pet. And yes, I did consider just feeding her to my snake since she was dead anyway and the right size for a feeder. But these little rituals are how I define which animals are family and which animals I have more distance from, and giving her the full pomp and circumstance my other pets have gotten felt more or less right.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 you're my kind of people", "This is hilarious and adorable and I love your family \ud83d\ude02", "You likely won\u2019t be able to cremate what remains, if it\u2019s liquid.
