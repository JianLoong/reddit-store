It\u2019s not like you did this on purpose (even though it is absolutely hilarious) and they need to just calm down.

What SIL *thought* she found was definitely worth getting distraught over, but her reaction was a little excessive. That said, I think it's perfectly reasonable to not think to mention \"by the way, I taxidermied my dog\" especially if he's taking his final snooze in an office or room that doesn't sound like a common area. If they hadn't overreacted, I'd say this was a N A H situation. As it is though I'd say they're TA. Your SIL may be embarrassed but she needs to take a leaf out of Franco's book and calm down and nap it off. You would not be at all out of line for refusing to pay for a hotel room for them.", "NAH\n\nI mean, you should have warned them, as a courtesy. But the stuffed dog was in your office, not the living room. You didn't mean to freak out your SIL. This is one of those things where I think everyone should have a good laugh and then go back to their holiday fun.", "NTA. Weird, yes. Asshole, no. \n\nI can\u2019t believe they asked you to help pay for a hotel. They need to chill out a bit. I\u2019m sure everyone will be laughing about this in a couple of days.", "NTA.  Had to get that out of the way before saying that Y T A for posting this because now I peed myself a little. Not from fright. From laughing.  This is the funniest thing I have ever read on this sub.  Maybe get a little plaque or something to let people know Franco isn't with you anymore.  Also. Dog tax please.", "NTA - Kingsman reference = \ud83d\udd25", "Am I the only one kinda bothered that SIL tried to shop a sleeping dog off the couch?

If you find a pet that\u2019s seemingly died in its sleep unbeknownst to its owner who\u2019s nearby, maybe don\u2019t freak out and make the trauma worse for them? Your SIL is not wrong for freaking out but she could\u2019ve handled things better regardless of if she stumbled on a dead pet or not. \n\nI think she\u2019s embarrassed for overreacting and peeing herself and that\u2019s why she\u2019s doubling down. Apologize for frightening her and maybe give a brief explanation for having your buddy forever napping on your office couch.", "I do think it's a bit weird, but you do you. If it's something that brings you comfort, then that's all that matters.\n\nI would go with NAH. If I was your SIL, I probably would have veeeery freaked out. But also, if I were you, this could have been something that would completely slip my mind to tell people.", "Nta. A warning would have been good, but your forgot. Having a stuffed dog is a bit weird, but it's not like you've got a human corpse in the living room. Staying at a hotel is a massive overreaction.

It\u2019s not like you caused her a fright on purpose; it just wasn\u2019t on your mind to mention it. She wasn\u2019t TA for being freaked out, but they are now for their massive overreaction and saying you should pay for their hotel.", "NTA. SIL needs to get over herself. Would she run off to stay at a hotel if you walked around a corner at night and she peed because she thought it was a burglar? Ridiculous. Also... she thought one of your dogs died on the couch, and her reaction was not to immediately bring it to your attention and be concerned, but to scream and run away crying?? What a dick.", "NTA for the question asked. However you should have talked about it beforehand. In my family we've already agreed our dog is getting stuffed and mounted over the mantle when he dies so he can stay with us. It's not often people get to keep their family members in such a physical way, so taxidermy (especially when it's done so well) deserves serious bragging", "NTA - you put Franco in your office, a room normally no guest go. You didn't put him on display in the kitchen or anything crazy. I can understand that you want to hold on to a dear animal. And if hunters can display their game, why can't you hold on to a dear pet? You should apologize for scaring her, because it was your fault for not warning her when she went into the office.", "i agree with most of this comment but as said in the post the dog is in OPs office where no one except OP is. she saw it because she walked into OPs office not because it was in a public space", "NTA. That's what she gets for trying to shoo an old dog off the couch. She's just embarrassed, but needs to pull it together and give a good example to the kids. It's something to laugh about and carry on, no reason to ruin the visit.", "NTA.", "It's your house and the dog was in your private office. Is it really up to you to try to figure out what all could or would freak out someone else in your private office, just so you can warn them? And even if you had warned them, would this mean that they would have looked for other sleeping arrangements? \n\nIs it creepy?  To me, yes. But would this entitle me to demand/expect you to \"pitch \" in for my hotel stay? I wish, but no it does not.\n\nNtA", "Taxidermy animals are generally shocking to the population-she literally peed herself scared. She might just need to remove herself from the situation entirely to calm down, but in *no way* should you be forced to pay for her hotel stay. \n\nFranco is in the office, not in the living room, kitchen, or their bedroom. He\u2019s not in their way. NTA.", "I can't really call either you or your SIL an AH. I lost my cat, that I tamed from feral to demanding lap cat, several months ago. While I wouldn't be able to handle seeing her taxidermied, I do have her ashes. I empathize with how hard it is when we lose our pets, because they're part of our family.\n\nNow that I established how important pets are in my eyes, I have to say: I would freak out if I thought I noticed your dog had just died before you did. Even moreso knowing you lost one within the last year or two. It would take me a little while to get my emotions under control again.\n\nI don't think you deserve to be berated by the rest of the family though. You weren't malicious or anything, you just forgot because it's not as odd to you as it is for other people. It wasn't at the forefront of your mind for that reason.\n\nNAH", "NTA - much because I\u2019ve entertained the thought of having our cat taxidermied when she puts her paws up for eternal rest. \n\nMy husband isn\u2019t loving that idea though, so she\u2019ll most likely get a little burial in our back garden, next to our peaceful hide away\u2026 \ud83e\udd72", "NTA she came in your office and got upset at a piece of your property that you didn\u2019t think was weird so you didn\u2019t think to tell her. She\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. Has to re-read it because at first I thought it was a small child that had a connection with the dog or something (hence the peeing and running away) and if it was a smaller child who knew the dog I\u2019d say you were kinda  T A but that that is not what happened", "NTA. I wouldn't stuff a pet like that, but you do you. It doesn't hurt anyone. I wouldn't pay for the hotel either. It's your home. If they aren't comfortable there that is within their rights but it's still their problem.", "NTA. personally i'm a little scared of taxidermy myself so i get where your SIL is coming from, but it's your dog and your house, and unless she has like a debilitating taxidermy phobia that she told you about beforehand, she shouldn't be putting blame on you for something that's not malicious, targeted, or even intentional. It might be good though to get some sort of plaque or display thing for Franco, just to make it more clear that he's taxidermied.", "NTA and what? They are guilting you out of something in your home? It is your home so you get to decide what is in the house. Making you pay? Naaaa. She can't handle it, that is on her. Stuffed animals may be weird to her, but not to all of us.", "NTA. Do not pay! She/they are welcome to stay or go\u2026.. but it\u2019s their decision, the cost is totally on them. Total overreaction. Enjoy Christmas!", "[deleted]", "ESH  \n\n\nYeah, you should have warned them. I don't believe for a second you didn't have enough time to do so. I think her response to it was perfectly reasonable at the moment it happened. That doesn't mean she's entitled to having you pay for a hotel.", "YTA. Not because you have a taxidermied pup and don't want to pay for the hotel but for not recognizing the fright it could cause having a dead dog on your couch and then blaming her for what was clearly a big shock. \n\nYou set a trap (intentional or not) and she got caught our. I've seen taxidermy but never where a human would expect to sit\n\nYou didn't apologize or empathize with your family member, just explained.\n\nShe got a shock and seriously embarrassed.\n\nIf you aren't willing to apologize and have a heart to heart with the fam you're missing the point of family and setting a poor example for your nieces.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
