I'm really sorry for your loss. Life waits for no one. \n\nSome unsolicited advice here: make sure to take care of yourself. When my Father died, I had been trying to break into the industry I'm in today and a month after his passing, I got a job. I obviously accepted. \n\nKnowing what I know now, I'm not sure I would have taken it. I really could have used the next few months to grief, heal, and plan my move forward.", "NTA\n\nSorry for your loss.\n\nIf you feel you can soldier through and do well, that's great. But if it is too hard, you might contact the admins of your school and ask for an extention or later date for exam.", "Info: Does your school provide bereavement leave? Have you talked to the school about taking the exam at another time or getting an exemption from taking the exam? Have you taked to your professor(s) about getting extra notes or relevant exam information at a later date. Could a friend take notes for you? \n\nI am sorry for your loss. \n\nPlease look after yourself and your parents during these difficult times.", "NAH.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. \n\nEveryone grieves differently. \n\nSome people need to take off from their job/school, some don\u2019t.", "NTA, but try not resent your parents who are handling the situation/grieving differently than you.\n\nSorry for your loss friend.", "NTA \n\nEveryone deals with death differently . I also tend to stay focused.  Sorry for your loss\n\nI was scheduled to move 2k miles away when we lost my sister - I moved 12 hours after her funeral.  My mom was very upset with me, but I had no choice", "NTA.   \n\n\ncondolences for your loss.   \n\n\nyou were right to go to school. You have a responsibility toward yourself to do what you need to do to succeed. It was inappropriate for your parents to take their grief out on you.", "NTA. People grieve differently If this just happened you probably have not even processed anything. I know when I was a student and I had death in my family a few times I just had to carry on my mom one time didn't tell me my great grandmother died because she didn't want me to miss school I mean she told me a few days later after she knew I had a test. Just say everyone Grieves differently and your brother wouldn't want you to be derailed by his death.", "NTA. You are a person, not an emotional support animal. Just because someone dies, doesn\u2019t mean the world stops. They have each other\u2019s support, they could manage a few hours with out you.", "NTA, you'll still need the education long after the funeral. I understand that your parents wanted with them for the support in spite of what you have going on. Tough situation all around. Sorry for your loss.", "Nta your parents need to realize lashing out on you while your already under pressure isn't doing themselves any favors in the long run. They need to process their emotions and not look for a punching bag when you don't live up to their unnecessary expectations. You all are hurting and can look into grief counseling.", "NTA.  Sorry for your loss.  The best way to grief is to carry on doing what you are called to do.", "NTA.  Sorry for your lose.  Everyone grieves differently and your parents lashing out at you is unfortunate and wrong.  You have not failed your parents, you are dealing with things in your own way.  If you want you can have a talk with your professor and let them know whats going on and see if they will allow you to make up the exams at a later date ( some will and some won't).  But do not let your parents action make you feel like you did anything wrong.  What if your grieving ment you not wanting to be around them or anyone else because you need to get your mind together, then what would they do.  Everyone grieves in their own way, grief does not look the same on everyone.", "NTA. When my family member died and I asked for extensions in college, I was denied by one teacher, asked to provide the death certificate by another, and scolded in class by another because their former students hadn\u2019t asked for extensions after deaths in their family. I definitely did not get extra assistance or have an easier time. I ended up withdrawing that term and then was put on financial aid probation by the school and had to get that straightened out. My other family member soldiered on in her job and life and got heavily criticized for it, but she did what she needed to do to make things happen and not sink into despair. Do whatever you need to do to maintain yourself. If your school has free counselors in your health center you can check in with them so you have someone to talk to. I think the first year is the hardest. Good luck to you.", "NAH\n\nMy condolences.\n\nI understand that you might want to keep busy, and that to have the school work to focus on is a good distraction.  You may not feel that way in a day or two, OR, you may be doing it because you feel you have to, because of exams.   \n\n\nEither way, I would make sure that you talk to your professor / admin / appropriate person to let them know what has happened.  If it is an option to delay / defer the exam, or have assessment based on course work to date (depending on the rules where you are), you want to make sure that you have that option available - especially as you're possibly a bit overwhelmed mentally at the moment.", "NTA my deepest condolences to you. You are focusing on your education. Your parents need to respect that small fact. \n\nI have lost brothers and other family members. I would go to the funeral but if I had other commitments like school or work unfortunately I will do that and take time off when I can usually a few days later.", "NTA\n\nGrief is different for everyone.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "There is no wrong way to grieve. It is incredibly selfish, immature, and entitled of your parents to say you\u2019re \u201cfailing them when they need you most.\u201d It\u2019s not your responsibility to manage or assuage their grief. NTA\n\nI will say that if you told your professors the circumstances, no reasonable person would expect you to take midterms as scheduled", "NAH.   \nThey are in emotional shock, and wanted your support. Lashing out at you was wrong, but not uncommon when dealing with sudden death.   \nYou are also likely in shock, and reaching for an anchor of stability- like school- is also not uncommon.  Explain to them that you understand, but you need to get through these midterms for \\*your\\* mental health, and then you will be in a better place to be supportive of them.", "NTA. Grief is different for each of us, and so long as you don't have a complete grief meltdown in the middle of a test, you can temporarily set your emotions aside and then process everything when there's less pressure from your classes. Good luck.", "NTA, but honestly, \u201cmy brother died\u201d is a pretty good excuse to get an extension on an exam. If you need it", "I'm so sorry for your loss. Please tell your professors what happened, so they're aware you might need time away. Grief is weird. Sometimes it takes longer to process, so you feel fine until you're suddenly not. If you feel ok to go to class, and you feel like being there is helpful for you, then go. As long as you're not causing harm to yourself, handle it in the way that feels right to you. If you feel like you just can't go in, then email/ text your professors and don't feel bad about taking that time.", "NTA.  Maybe they need support - and presumably you are now their only surviving child.  But you have your own needs - and right now focussing on school may be what you need.   It's hard enough you lost your brother, but sacrificing a year of your life (which is what it may cost to fail exams at this point in time) to sit with them is not going to help anyone.  Grief doesn't come to everyone in the same way at the same time.", "NTA. \u201cWhen they need you the most.\u201d What do you need? Only you can decide that. People grieve in different ways, and handle their daily life when someone dies in different ways.", "Life doesn\u2019t stop for no one, lost my dad going on 7 years ago and still had bills to pay and a degree to finish. Some people look at that as cold hearted but people die everyday and you can\u2019t change that fact. Not saying to not mourn your loss but also don\u2019t let it get out of hand where you mess up your life.", "NTA. Everybody grieves differently and in their own time. There is no wrong way to grieve, as long as you DO grieve rather than ignoring how you feel. \n\nI'm so terribly sorry for your loss.", "So sorry for your loss. Every grieves differently and that is ok. Just let your parents know you are also grieving but for you going to class is helpful. Best wishes for the exam. Let them know of your brother\u2019s death and they may take that into account with the marking", "I'm sorry for your loss. My mom also died during my senior year. Personally, I emailed my profs, told them I'd be back at class in a week, and logged off completely. But after that week, I tried my best to meet every deadline, take every exam, etc. with minimal extensions because it helped me to have structure and lose myself in my work as the rest of my life came crashing down. It is also hard because if you have a full course load, getting behind early in the semester means that later in the semester gets more hectic, so it can be easier to just stay on top of things despite how hard things are. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with getting on with the important aspects of your life. But please, do e-mail your professors and ask for extensions (including for your upcoming midterms) if you feel you need to. When I told my professors I viewed it as laying groundwork - they know you're grieving and will be willing to work with you on deadlines, etc. as you grieve so you have a little more flexibility if you end up needing it. It's hard to know this early how you will need to grieve. Be kind to yourself, do what you need to do.\n\nI'll say ultimately NAH because your parents just lost a son and may not be thinking as clearly, kindly, or fairly as they otherwise would. Give them grace if you can.", "NTA. I didn\u2019t take a day off when my dad died because I needed to throw myself into work to distract me so I could grieve without falling into a major depression. Everyone grieves in their own way and you did what felt most appropriate for you for the time being.", "NTA everyone grieves differently and your way was to keep moving. I remember after my father died I didn't stop for almost a week because the SECOND I slowed down it flattened me. It hit me all at once and I suppose I knew it was coming and a part of me knew I was running I just kept telling myself that the world didn't end and I had responsibilities.\n\nTell your parents you love them but this is how you're coping, by staying in motion.", "NTA - I went to work the day after my Dad died.  There honestly wasn't anything I could do so I kept busy by going to work.", "NTA. As someone who was married to a person with substance use disorder, sometimes their death isn\u2019t that surprising. You have to look after your needs and priorities. You\u2019re ok doll. Many condolences and I wouldn\u2019t wish this on someone. But he is at peace.", "YTA\n\n\nBro, you tell your professors your brother died and they won't make you take the tests. \n\nThey will understand and either coast you or reschedule.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
