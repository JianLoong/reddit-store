I guess your mom could have said \u201cyour coworkers, with the exception of Katie, see you as a baby.\u201d But this wouldn\u2019t have changed the her point. The reality is that you ARE a lot younger than the majority of your coworkers. Your mom is right\u2026Katie might not be seen as a baby\u2026despite her age\u2026because her experience as a parent will make her seem older to her coworkers. She\u2019s in a stage of life that is associated with people in their 30\u2019s. It\u2019s not the same with education. If anything, your being in college will make it seem like you are younger, as college is associated with being in an earlier stage in life.", "NTA - we live in an ableist society and that plays into this for sure. Your mom probably sees you as her baby, which isn\u2019t at its core a bad thing. It can turn into a bad thing. I would also argue that the coworker who is 24 is having children while a child at 18. Not including the fact that having children doesn\u2019t make you smarter or better. You\u2019ll have more knowledge in theory. Edit to add your no more an adult than your co worker but attitude is what matters. Maturity is shown through that more than anything.", "NAH. I think you are reading too much into it if I'm honest; having an education and having kids are not the same thing, in any case. I don't think commenting on Katie's education was necessary or kind. I don't see where anyone said you're 'less' of an adult; only that you're the youngest there. Maybe Katie looks older? I wouldn't know. But I do know people graduate at different times and getting your first job at 25 not abnormal.", "NTA \n\nHaving kids doesn\u2019t automatically makes you more mature. Watch pregnant 16 as example. In many cases people who have kids early are more immature because they think that kids are easy, while mature individuals take it more seriously. \nI think would be good to get a job separate from your parents so people don\u2019t infantilize you. Also, living with your parents makes other people feel that you are younger. But after you are done with college, you can go on and not be a baby anymore. However even after college, on many jobs you will be the youngest. Just a part of life. It is ok. Just ignore and do your best", "NAH, agree with others. Having kids and being a parent provides a lot of life experience. College provides different things - skills, knowledge, etc, but not that life experience. Your mom was referring to that. It might be a bit insensitive (there's no deficiency in not having kids) but that experience is a real thing.", "NTA - you are free to feel however you want to feel, but this isn't a competition on who has it harder or who is more \"adult.\" Everyone has their challenges and some people have more privilege than others thanks to certain aspects of their lift. Getting caught up in this kind of drama is definitely a sign of immaturity.", "Probably an unpopular opinion, but YTA. You're taking it way too personally. I've been called the baby or a baby by coworkers when I was your age, and it had nothing to do with being less of an adult; it was because I was literally the youngest person there. Likewise, now that I'm older, I've also called people that age the baby; and it still has nothing to do with how much or how little you've accomplished in your life.", "NAH:  But I'm on your mom side, Katie is older than you, has a full time job, married has two kids and her own home. It's a combination of all of these things that make her more of an adult it's not just the children.  \n\nMy guess your mom wouldn't have the same energy if it was an unemployed 18 year old with 2 kids who live with their parents.", "YTA - You're a college junior and Katie is a working mother. Katie objectively has more responsibilities than you do and people depend on her... you ARE still a kid compared to her. That is reality, it's not a value judgement. Do some work on that chip you've got on your shoulder.", "YTA.  You\u2019re not being infantilized.  Like it or not, being a childless twentysomething who\u2019s relatively new to the workforce *does* distinguish you from someone who\u2019s been working for a while to support a family.  If your coworkers\u2019 attitude about that affects your ability to do your job or earn promotions, that\u2019s a sign you\u2019re at a shitty company, but I think you\u2019re going to find the thing *most* likely to render you unpopular in the workplace is picking fights that don\u2019t need to be fights.", "NAH Not a parent myself although well older than you.  From what I\u2019ve observed, have been told, and from what I feel, becoming a parent is a right of passage that changes a person.  Younger colleagues with children are in some ways older and wiser than I am.  Colleagues of the same age even more so (most of my friends are childless, and rather childish in various ways).  It\u2019s hard to put into words, as your mother knows from the unfortunate conversation, but it is real.\n\nAddition:  Not always the case ofc.  Only moments ago I was replying to an OP who bullies his 8 year old son and panders to his 17 year old daughter.", "I say OP is NTA.  Her mother is fully aware of why OP is still working through her degree and instead of praising her daughter for persevering to complete her education and get established in her career before starting a family (if that is something OP wants), she chose to be ableist about it and compare OP to her coworker of a similar age.\n\nOP's coworker started a family young, that's great for her if that's what she wanted. But it doesn't make her more of an adult than OP, they just have different priorities and/or opportunities at this point in their lives.", "NTA.\n\nHaving children doesn't automatically chance your maturity level nor should it impact how you are treated at work. Your mom is being deliberately insulting and applying a double standard. GC dynamic at work, perhaps.", "NAH, Agree with other posters, though you may not want to hear it.\n\nFor reference, I'm a child-free woman in my 40s.  I would not say that having children automatically, makes you more mature, but I do understand why your coworker said what she said.\n\nI think it's important to note that no one here was purposefully trying to hurt another person and it seems like everyone stated their viewpoint calmly and honestly.  This was a great conversation to have, because we don't always see eye-to-eye with the people around us.\n\nAlso, good for you in stating your point and making a good one!

I think Katie is viewed as an \"adult\" not b/c she has kids, but is independent (and also has dependents).  I don't think they see you as a baby b/c of your childfree or education level, but the fact that you are 22.  A group of people in their 80s will tell a bunch of people in their 50s that they are young.\n\nI observed (and I'm now 40) that 26 is the magical age when most people generally switch from being viewed as a kid to an adult.", "YTA", "Yta- YOU ARE A BABY.  at 22 you are still a child...

I don\u2019t want to bring a child into this world when I can\u2019t take care of myself.", "The implication that it makes me less mature than her", "If my mom said \u201cshe went to college and you didn\u2019t\u201d Katie would be offended too", "Calling someone immature for being childfree is offensive and it\u2019s just as bad as saying that she\u2019s immature because she didn\u2019t go to college", "You keep ignoring what that commenter is saying about there being multiple factors involved here. \n\nYou don't have to like what was said but the least adult thing you can do is argue about how adult you are. It's like teens bragging about being \"mature for their age\" in that it's a bit of a giveaway. Mature people don't talk like that and adults don't talk like that.", "Ok, but that has nothing to do with me saying it's a combination of multiple things.  Also it's really not that big of a deal give yourself 4 years you won't want to be an adult", "In my experience 8 times out of 10, it does.\n\nEdit: Suddenly grateful for the general decency of the people in my life.", "Congrats.  Your mom is a dick in the general sense. \n\nIn this case, she's not wrong and you picked a totally unnecessary fight.  You keep copy-pasting this like you think it will absolve you in this specific instance any time anyone says you're wrong. \n\nIf you're pissed off at your mom for how she handled your suicide attempt at 18, be pissed off about that.  Don't start petty shit like this and go complaining to the internet.", "I feel like there is a lot to unpack with a therapist, but this specific argument isn't worth it.  Maybe you spend too much time together, between living AND working together. Maybe this Katie person is a character foil in your life. \n\nRe: the suicide attempt - Your mom's reaction is SO off-base, that she either completely lacks empathy OR she finds your behavior to be more histrionic than empathetic (where she finds a \"baby having babies\" to be a \"real problem\")... the truth may be somewhere in the middle, but it's not something AITA can delve into.\n\nI'd recommend finding a good therapist, and maybe even a family therapist, b/c AITA isn't here to solve problems.", "But the original comment about being a baby (which didn't offend you) was about age, not maturity. You put your mother on the spot and blindsided her by bringing Katie into it (which, why would you do that if you werent offended in the first place), and got offended because she blurted out the first thing that came to mind, which is a true statement about  lKatie having kids.\n\nSee, the thing is, taking on the responsibility of keeping two humans alive and teaching them how to be productive members of society weighs a little more than continuing education in the spectrum of life experience. Does it make someone more mature? Absolutely not. There are plenty of 30 and 40 year olds that aren't mature enough to have children (Reddit continues to prove this regularly). But when put on the spot, I can see how someone would jump to that.\n\nI still think it's your own fault for being offended, mostly because you brought someone else into the conversation instead of just accepting the comment about being a baby. I don't really believe you weren't offended by it, because if you weren't, you wouldn't need to bring Katie up in the first place.", "But having a child forced a young person to grow up quicker, while prolonged education can have the opposite effect, if any at all.  It would make more sense to say someone is immature *because* they're still in school.", "It\u2019s not calling you immature, it\u2019s pointing out that Katie has responsibilities that you don\u2019t have. In your early 20s, having two children makes a huge difference as to how adult people see you. It stops being that way when you\u2019re a bit older, I\u2019m 38 and childless and no one would suggest I\u2019m not an adult (unfortunately, tbh) but at a young age it makes a huge difference.", "You really need to drop all the talk about maturity. It's not helping the case you're trying to make that being live at home college junior is basically the same as being a married mother of two.", "There is a lot of baggage between us because when I had a failed suicide attempt at 18 she said \u201cgrow up already, when Katie was your age she had a baby.\u201d She\u2019s also denied me medical care as a child and said that I\u2019m probably going to die before I\u2019m 40 and nobody will care. But sure, being a mother is so great and makes you so kind.\n\nI\u2019m the selfish one for not bringing a child into a world of suffering with a disabled parent because I wanted to have fun in high school.", "Lol this is so far from true it's hilarious."]}
