I guess your mom could have said \u201cyour coworkers, with the exception of Katie, see you as a baby.\u201d But this wouldn\u2019t have changed the her point. The reality is that you ARE a lot younger than the majority of your coworkers. Your mom is right\u2026Katie might not be seen as a baby\u2026despite her age\u2026because her experience as a parent will make her seem older to her coworkers. She\u2019s in a stage of life that is associated with people in their 30\u2019s. It\u2019s not the same with education. If anything, your being in college will make it seem like you are younger, as college is associated with being in an earlier stage in life.", "NTA - we live in an ableist society and that plays into this for sure. Your mom probably sees you as her baby, which isn\u2019t at its core a bad thing. It can turn into a bad thing. I would also argue that the coworker who is 24 is having children while a child at 18. Not including the fact that having children doesn\u2019t make you smarter or better. You\u2019ll have more knowledge in theory. Edit to add your no more an adult than your co worker but attitude is what matters. Maturity is shown through that more than anything.", "NAH. I think you are reading too much into it if I'm honest; having an education and having kids are not the same thing, in any case. I don't think commenting on Katie's education was necessary or kind. I don't see where anyone said you're 'less' of an adult; only that you're the youngest there. Maybe Katie looks older? I wouldn't know. But I do know people graduate at different times and getting your first job at 25 not abnormal.", "NTA \n\nHaving kids doesn\u2019t automatically makes you more mature. Watch pregnant 16 as example. In many cases people who have kids early are more immature because they think that kids are easy, while mature individuals take it more seriously. \nI think would be good to get a job separate from your parents so people don\u2019t infantilize you. Also, living with your parents makes other people feel that you are younger. But after you are done with college, you can go on and not be a baby anymore. However even after college, on many jobs you will be the youngest. Just a part of life. It is ok. Just ignore and do your best", "NAH, agree with others. Having kids and being a parent provides a lot of life experience. College provides different things - skills, knowledge, etc, but not that life experience. Your mom was referring to that. It might be a bit insensitive (there's no deficiency in not having kids) but that experience is a real thing.", "NTA - you are free to feel however you want to feel, but this isn't a competition on who has it harder or who is more \"adult.\" Everyone has their challenges and some people have more privilege than others thanks to certain aspects of their lift. Getting caught up in this kind of drama is definitely a sign of immaturity.", "Probably an unpopular opinion, but YTA. You're taking it way too personally. I've been called the baby or a baby by coworkers when I was your age, and it had nothing to do with being less of an adult; it was because I was literally the youngest person there. Likewise, now that I'm older, I've also called people that age the baby; and it still has nothing to do with how much or how little you've accomplished in your life.", "NAH:  But I'm on your mom side, Katie is older than you, has a full time job, married has two kids and her own home. It's a combination of all of these things that make her more of an adult it's not just the children.  \n\nMy guess your mom wouldn't have the same energy if it was an unemployed 18 year old with 2 kids who live with their parents.", "YTA - You're a college junior and Katie is a working mother. Katie objectively has more responsibilities than you do and people depend on her... you ARE still a kid compared to her. That is reality, it's not a value judgement. Do some work on that chip you've got on your shoulder.", "YTA.  You\u2019re not being infantilized.  Like it or not, being a childless twentysomething who\u2019s relatively new to the workforce *does* distinguish you from someone who\u2019s been working for a while to support a family.  If your coworkers\u2019 attitude about that affects your ability to do your job or earn promotions, that\u2019s a sign you\u2019re at a shitty company, but I think you\u2019re going to find the thing *most* likely to render you unpopular in the workplace is picking fights that don\u2019t need to be fights.", "NAH Not a parent myself although well older than you.  From what I\u2019ve observed, have been told, and from what I feel, becoming a parent is a right of passage that changes a person.  Younger colleagues with children are in some ways older and wiser than I am.  Colleagues of the same age even more so (most of my friends are childless, and rather childish in various ways).  It\u2019s hard to put into words, as your mother knows from the unfortunate conversation, but it is real.\n\nAddition:  Not always the case ofc.  Only moments ago I was replying to an OP who bullies his 8 year old son and panders to his 17 year old daughter.", "I say OP is NTA.  Her mother is fully aware of why OP is still working through her degree and instead of praising her daughter for persevering to complete her education and get established in her career before starting a family (if that is something OP wants), she chose to be ableist about it and compare OP to her coworker of a similar age.\n\nOP's coworker started a family young, that's great for her if that's what she wanted. But it doesn't make her more of an adult than OP, they just have different priorities and/or opportunities at this point in their lives.", "NTA.\n\nHaving children doesn't automatically chance your maturity level nor should it impact how you are treated at work. Your mom is being deliberately insulting and applying a double standard. GC dynamic at work, perhaps.", "NAH, Agree with other posters, though you may not want to hear it.\n\nFor reference, I'm a child-free woman in my 40s.  I would not say that having children automatically, makes you more mature, but I do understand why your coworker said what she said.\n\nI think it's important to note that no one here was purposefully trying to hurt another person and it seems like everyone stated their viewpoint calmly and honestly.  This was a great conversation to have, because we don't always see eye-to-eye with the people around us.\n\nAlso, good for you in stating your point and making a good one!

I think Katie is viewed as an \"adult\" not b/c she has kids, but is independent (and also has dependents).  I don't think they see you as a baby b/c of your childfree or education level, but the fact that you are 22.  A group of people in their 80s will tell a bunch of people in their 50s that they are young.\n\nI observed (and I'm now 40) that 26 is the magical age when most people generally switch from being viewed as a kid to an adult.", "YTA", "Yta- YOU ARE A BABY.  at 22 you are still a child...

I don\u2019t want to bring a child into this world when I can\u2019t take care of myself.", "The implication that it makes me less mature than her", "If my mom said \u201cshe went to college and you didn\u2019t\u201d Katie would be offended too", "Calling someone immature for being childfree is offensive and it\u2019s just as bad as saying that she\u2019s immature because she didn\u2019t go to college", "You keep ignoring what that commenter is saying about there being multiple factors involved here. \n\nYou don't have to like what was said but the least adult thing you can do is argue about how adult you are. It's like teens bragging about being \"mature for their age\" in that it's a bit of a giveaway. Mature people don't talk like that and adults don't talk like that.", "Ok, but that has nothing to do with me saying it's a combination of multiple things.  Also it's really not that big of a deal give yourself 4 years you won't want to be an adult", "In my experience 8 times out of 10, it does.\n\nEdit: Suddenly grateful for the general decency of the people in my life.", "Congrats.  Your mom is a dick in the general sense. \n\nIn this case, she's not wrong and you picked a totally unnecessary fight.  You keep copy-pasting this like you think it will absolve you in this specific instance any time anyone says you're wrong. \n\nIf you're pissed off at your mom for how she handled your suicide attempt at 18, be pissed off about that.  Don't start petty shit like this and go complaining to the internet.", "I feel like there is a lot to unpack with a therapist, but this specific argument isn't worth it.  Maybe you spend too much time together, between living AND working together. Maybe this Katie person is a character foil in your life. \n\nRe: the suicide attempt - Your mom's reaction is SO off-base, that she either completely lacks empathy OR she finds your behavior to be more histrionic than empathetic (where she finds a \"baby having babies\" to be a \"real problem\")... the truth may be somewhere in the middle, but it's not something AITA can delve into.\n\nI'd recommend finding a good therapist, and maybe even a family therapist, b/c AITA isn't here to solve problems.", "But the original comment about being a baby (which didn't offend you) was about age, not maturity. You put your mother on the spot and blindsided her by bringing Katie into it (which, why would you do that if you werent offended in the first place), and got offended because she blurted out the first thing that came to mind, which is a true statement about  lKatie having kids.\n\nSee, the thing is, taking on the responsibility of keeping two humans alive and teaching them how to be productive members of society weighs a little more than continuing education in the spectrum of life experience. Does it make someone more mature? Absolutely not. There are plenty of 30 and 40 year olds that aren't mature enough to have children (Reddit continues to prove this regularly). But when put on the spot, I can see how someone would jump to that.\n\nI still think it's your own fault for being offended, mostly because you brought someone else into the conversation instead of just accepting the comment about being a baby. I don't really believe you weren't offended by it, because if you weren't, you wouldn't need to bring Katie up in the first place.", "But having a child forced a young person to grow up quicker, while prolonged education can have the opposite effect, if any at all.  It would make more sense to say someone is immature *because* they're still in school.", "It\u2019s not calling you immature, it\u2019s pointing out that Katie has responsibilities that you don\u2019t have. In your early 20s, having two children makes a huge difference as to how adult people see you. It stops being that way when you\u2019re a bit older, I\u2019m 38 and childless and no one would suggest I\u2019m not an adult (unfortunately, tbh) but at a young age it makes a huge difference.", "You really need to drop all the talk about maturity. It's not helping the case you're trying to make that being live at home college junior is basically the same as being a married mother of two.", "There is a lot of baggage between us because when I had a failed suicide attempt at 18 she said \u201cgrow up already, when Katie was your age she had a baby.\u201d She\u2019s also denied me medical care as a child and said that I\u2019m probably going to die before I\u2019m 40 and nobody will care. But sure, being a mother is so great and makes you so kind.\n\nI\u2019m the selfish one for not bringing a child into a world of suffering with a disabled parent because I wanted to have fun in high school.", "Lol this is so far from true it's hilarious.", "NAH but I think you're taking this way too personally. You are literally younger, still in school, and getting financially supported by your parents. It's pretty much a fact that people are going to view you as \"younger\" than someone who's 24, working and supporting herself, and raising kids. \n\nGoing or not going to college doesn't really indicate age/life experience as much, as someone not in college would still be doing something else like working, interning, studying a trade, etc.", "NAH", "NAH\n\n>I said that saying that I\u2019m less of an adult because I don\u2019t have kids is just as cruel.\n\nCruel?  I think that perhaps you\u2019re slightly\u2026defensive? about not having kids.  You have every right not to *ever* have kids if that\u2019s what you want, but you need to understand that parents have responsibilities that child free people just don\u2019t.\n\nWhen people have extra responsibilities, it tends to make them grow up faster.  I\u2019m not knocking child free people - I don\u2019t have kids either.  But I know for a fact that my sister was a LOT more mature than me as a 22-year old wife and mother than I was at the same age, single and living at home.\n\nYou\u2019re only 22.  And I see that you\u2019re going in to teaching?  Dang, girl.  Feel PROUD of yourself for that.  Public education is a disaster right now, and they can use all the help they can get.  So it\u2019s okay if it takes you a little bit longer to get where you need to go.  It doesn\u2019t matter how long it takes.  All that matters is that you get there.\n\nYour mom may have been a bit insensitive.  My mom is too.  Remember that mothers are people, and people sometimes say things that come out weird.  I remember reading this somewhere:\n\n\u201cIf what I said could have been taken two different ways, and only one of those ways was hurtful, please know that I meant it in the other way.\u201d", "ESH but mostly you. For someone so intent on proving that having children doesn\u2019t make you more mature, you\u2019re certainly throwing a childish tantrum about it.", "TBH, this just comes off as you trying to call Katie uneducated because you didn\u2019t like a comparison made of the two of you by another person. \n\nI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s just a comparison of how the two of conduct yourselves, which could still be relevant regardless of who had kids or who graduated college. \n\nYTA", "Be glad you aren't Katie, as it sounds like she had to grow up and tackle all the not really fun parts of adulting before she probably was ready.  You probably wouldn't want to trade places with her anyways.  She is an adult in a different way than you are, that's all.  No shade to Katie, if she is happy, but I sure would rather be \"the baby\" than have a 6 year old and a 3 year old at age 24.\n\nI think ESH -- you and your mom.  Mom should recognize the sensitivity of your situation and you might be reading into this and looking for offense where none was intended.", "I sorta see both sides of the coin. \n\nBeing a mother makes you grow up in the blink of an eye so she is probably quite mature for her age.\n\nA university education is also important and I did it this way around aswell. A university education opens your mind in a way being a mother cannot but the opposite is also true. \n\nI think it\u2019s just an awkward situations and you\u2019re in different life spaces.", "One day soon you will like being thought of as young .  Not having the responsibility of children does make someone seem younger & more carefree - that\u2019s a good thing. Just say thank you !", "She gets financially supported too. And if I never have kids, does that make me immature forever?\n\nAnd I was working and supporting myself but moved back recently. I still work and pay all my bills except rent and dental insurance.", "In fact Katie got more support from her parents than me at age 22.", "Katie and I both moved out at 21.", "She had to and I didn\u2019t, clearly had nothing to do with my decision to be abstinent my entire life, except for the first four years of it when I wasn\u2019t given that option.\n\nBut I had it so easy.", "She had to and I didn\u2019t, clearly had nothing to do with my decision to be abstinent my entire life, except for the first four years of it when I wasn\u2019t given that option.\n\nBut I had it so easy.", "She had to be a mother and I didn\u2019t, clearly had nothing to do with my decision to be abstinent my entire life, except for the first four years of it when I wasn\u2019t given that option.\n\nBut I had it so easy.", "Thank you", "I had to avoid drugs my entire life because people who attempted suicide are high risk. And other coworkers were mocking me for it and belittling me saying that I never had any rebellious teen experiences.\n\nAnd raising a child is an accomplishment but it\u2019s not the only way to be an adult.", "wow .. that's a lot. \nI understand your reaction more now. \nYour mom is cruel.", "Hi uhm \n\nI wouldn\u2019t take anything your mom says to heart. She seems to have a track record of being very dismissive of your needs as well as your accomplishments. I hope you find a way to get some healthy space from her. It has to be very draining to hear all that and you certainly don\u2019t deserve it.", "Even if this is true, that doesn\u2019t excuse you dragging Katie into this and making offensive comments on her education, whether that was your intention or not. It sounds like Katie was not actually present for this conversation but if she was, would you have still said this? If not then there\u2019s your sign. \n\nThis is between you and your mom and you should keep it that way. And probably try and and move out and find other employment as soon as possible, it seems like your relationship is very toxic.", "You keep harping on maturity but your mom's comment was about how other people at the job would perceive you. It doesn't have anything to do with maturity. It has to do with the fact that you and Katie are in completely different life stages and she has a lot more traditional \"adult\" markers like a marriage, kids, lives independently, has a paid job, etc.", "You are clearly very grown up and responsible.\n\nI hope you are getting the mental health care that you need.\n\nA young person without kids and still in school, will be seen as more of a kid than a young person who is married and has kids and is working full time.  It\u2019s not about being mature or immature, just different phases of life.\n\nIt sounds like you aren\u2019t in a position right now to have kids, and that\u2019s ok.  You do you.  It\u2019s not a race or a competition.", "Dude, *why* are you still there?  You keep copying and pasting responses that don't relate to what you're responding to.  And they paint your relationship with your mother in a terrible light.  How on earth is living and working with this woman helping your mental health??  Get out, move literally anywhere else.", "I've been to college with a masters degree and had 3 kids. For me at least college didn't change me even close to as much as motherhood, and I know I'm not the only one. It's not to say that either of these is more or less valuable, but being a mum makes you grow up fast (and I was already mid 20s when I had my first kid)", "I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t quite understand what you mean. It feels as though you might have more issues with your mum than this one\u2026.", "We both moved out at 21, and I have a job too", "I\u2019m never having kids, does that mean that I am never going to pass her in life stages?", "Sure. If your definition of \"grow up\" is \"hold a job\". But emotionally immature parents are everywhere you look. Having a kid doesn't turn you into some sort of stable adult.", "She had to and I didn\u2019t, clearly had nothing to do with my decision to be abstinent my entire life, except for the first four years of it when I wasn\u2019t given that option.\n\nBut I had it so easy.", "\"it doesn\u2019t make me less of an adult... when I can\u2019t take care of myself.\"\n\nYou need to square your desire to be seen as an adult with the reality of your situation.", "It's not a ladder or a race. You don't \"pass\" people. Edit: and part of maturing is moving past these sorts of comparisons. I know it can be hard at 22, but life isn't something you progress through linearly and win or lose at. You don't \"pass\" people in life stages.", "It's not a race, life stages aren't arranged linearly.   If you never have kids then you will never join her in the life stage of being a parent. Neither of you is \"passing\" the other.", "Dude. It's not about \"having it easy\" it's about a difference in perspective. \n\nLike I told you elsewhere, this isn't an indictment on your choices. From what you've said, you're being responsible. You're doing exactly what you should be doing. \n\nI will say that the degree to which you seem butthurt over this comparison does speak to a level of immaturity as well, but again, not some big problem with your character. This is part of growing up, and it sounds like you're well on your way.\n\nBeing a parent is a fundamentally different relationship to life. It's not better or worse, but it does require a level of responsibility single people and people without kids generally don't need to practice.", "I still manage but often have challenges with my health and had to go to bed hungry because of the cost of healthcare. That\u2019s what I meant by can\u2019t take care of myself.", "This is the winner, right here. If you can convince everyone that Katie would have a similar over-the-top reaction to a statement of fact about her education... you're both equally immature.", "I should probably have sympathy for you right now but you throwing new and extremely heavy shit at me as if I\u2019m some kind of AH who is siding with an abuser makes me realise that the people around you probably know what they\u2019re talking about when they call you childish.  \n\nYTA", "I\u2019m a teacher, I have to educate 20 humans instead of two.", "She had to and I didn\u2019t, clearly had nothing to do with my decision to be abstinent my entire life, except for the first four years of it when I wasn\u2019t given that option.\n\nBut I had it so easy.", "Do you teach them how to brush their teeth?

Do you teach them how to bathe themselves and have proper hygiene? Do you teach time management, or do you just enforce what they should already have learned at home from their parents?", "> But I had it so easy.\n\nIf you say so.  I sure didn't."]}
