I suffered some injuries including a sprained ankle, fractured wrist and a few broken ribs. All in all I was really lucky.\n\nHowever this has caused issues in my day to day life. I struggle with getting in the shower (it\u2019s a shower in a bath so i have to step in), getting in and out of bed, i can\u2019t drive currently or get out of cars without exerting a lot of energy and causing myself a lot of pain. It\u2019s thoroughly exhausting me and i\u2019m unable to take OTC painkillers as they interact with some of my current medication and the medication recommended was opioid based (no thank u). I\u2019m also suffering from nightmares and am nervous to be around cars right now. \n\nI\u2019m living away from home in a different country so my parents aren\u2019t able to help me. The only person i have who can help me with these things is my partner but unfortunately he is unwilling. He is very reluctant to help me with anything I need and becomes really irritated when i ask. He helped me shower once but now holds it over my head whenever i ask him to help me with anything else. He was at his house when i asked him if he could help me shower for bed and possibly stay the night as i wake up in a lot of pain, unable to get up and suffer from nightmares. He told me that it was not that deep and i could deal until he wants to come over. I told him it was a big deal to me as this event has left me traumatised and i hate not being able to do things for myself and it was causing me a lot of distress. I broke down and pleaded with him to help me. He then got very angry with me and told me he was not coming over because he doesn\u2019t want to help me and he wants to relax without me burdening him. He also said he was going to spend this weekend without me so i\u2019d have to cope by myself.  I got very upset and told him he was upsetting me and only thinking of himself. He then turned his phone off. \n\nI\u2019m feeling really upset by this but can\u2019t help but feel like it\u2019s my fault for expecting his help and getting upset when he decides to not help me.

Contact the hospital and ask for one of their social workers to get in touch with you. The social workers should be able to help you arrange home based assistance, especially for helping with showering etc. The social workers may also be able to assist you to find someone to talk to about the trauma.\n\nIf you have any local friends or acquaintances reach out to them and ask them for help. You might not be comfortable with them helping you shower (which is why you get help from the hospital), but you're going to need help with much more than just showering for the next few weeks. Asking people to help you often is a great way to strengthen new friendships and people are often a lot more willing to help than we imagine. If there's a Facebook \"good karma network\" group active for your area, or a disability network on nextdoor reach out there too. You need help, there exist people who will help, you just need to find them.\n\nNo matter what happens with your jerk boyfriend, use this event to learn the importance of having friends and community.
