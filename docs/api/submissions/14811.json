We both decided my sister would learn the gender and host a gender reveal party for us (if she wanted), and she was extremely excited. We told her, however, not to invite my MIL and BIL (38).\nI have no problem with my BIL directly, but he's autistic and has extreme sensory issues mainly towards eating and becomes overwhelmed in large crowds or gatherings. He also has the tendacy to get angry when overstimulated, destroying things or screaming as a result. My MIL lets him do these things, and even made a mess at our wedding by calling me selfish for not inviting him to the event. It ended in our wedding cake on the floor from BIL freaking out and ripping a table cloth off our display table after MIL brought him to the wedding. She had the audicity after the mess to baby him and call me a whore for being upset, and has been passive aggresive towards me ever since. \nBack to the plans. My sister set up the baby shower/gender reveal. We connected with family about the news and party, and my sister posted about the event on her Facebook to draw the attention of some family members who didn't check messages. However, you can probably already guess that my MIL saw this and took it as an invite. \nThe day of the baby shower, my husband and I were both shocked to see his mom and brother show up and come straight towards us. I immediately felt anxious. Before either could say anything, I very softly asked them to leave because it'd be too loud for BIL. Most of our food choices were crunchy and my sister's reveal plan involved balloons and a confetti cannon. and I explained that to MIL. She instantly began to argue, telling me she had a right to be at the event and so did BIL, and that I was a bitch for not even giving him a chance. My husband tried to step in, and the whole arguement became a lot louder and longer than it needed to be, sending BIL into a freak out episode. Before he could do anything, my sister and dad worked together to get both of them out of my backyard. \nA few days after this event, my MIL sent me a long message telling me I didn't deserve her son nor our babies (we're having twin boys!) and that I had no right to treat her and BIL the way I did.\nAITA for not giving BIL/MIL a chance and kicking them out?", "created_utc": 1681505557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12md04u/aita_for_kicking_my_mil_and_bil_out_of_my_gender/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also the fact is OP's BIL is autstic and that means that participating in some activities, even with all the planning and support in the world, may unfortunately not be possible due to extreme discomfort/overstimulation. \n\nI once had a kid in summer camp who was autistic and he HATED bugs and would scream, cry, run away, and throw things if he saw them and couldn't get away from them. After 2 (5 hour long) lake trips with the camp of him crying, trying to run away, and screaming for his mom and about the bugs we spoke with his parents and all decided it would probably be best if he wasn't made to go on these trips until mom and dad tried with him and found a way to make it more comfortable for him, because it was clear it was more detrimental than beneficial for him at that point.\n\nI'm assuming MIL is BIL's caretaker, which means she as much as she may want to be a part of these celebrations, it is her responsibility not to bring son to places that are the definition of all his triggers knowing full well his reaction will be destructive because A) she shouldn't want to be making either of her children that uncomfortable. It's just cruel to intentionally put people in situations that will make them freak out. B) she doesn't seem to have any type of autistic meltdown calming rituals to be seen or heard of anywhere, which is just irresponsible. And C) she should care about ruining people's important events by excusing what is extremely inappropriate behaviors to exhibit at those events (kinda like bringing your kid to a movie theater and letting it scream through the whole movie instead of removing yourself and calming your child before re-entering)", ">You want to avoid a pattern of bad behavior.

From what I've experienced with her and BIL, it seems more like self rightous thing than it is an \"including BIL.\" I'd love to have him at events, and he's welcome over at any point, but when it's an event like a wedding or baby shower and she won't help him, I can't drop everything to help him myself nor do a lot of the guests understand how to.

He behaves badly so he can't come.", "Agreed.", "You're lucky you found people who match your energy so well!", "Agreed. At this point a gender reveal is essentially just the main game at a baby shower in my opinion.

Thank you and congrats on your pregnancy!", "Tell MIL you already (unwillingly) gave them a chance at your wedding & he destroyed the cake. Why would you give them another chance to ruin your baby reveal as well?", "Nah OP, don't doubt yourself, you already understand. Fact is that you seem to comprehend that there are environments that don't work with your BIL's autism and that his caretaker should be helping him cope or not bringing him at all so he's not uncomfortable, because those are the healthy options. Your MIL is not supporting your BIL in a healthy way or giving him any tools for success in regards to these situations, which if your boys end up on the spectrum I don't think will be the case with you. Any parent who puts their child intentionally into a stressful situation and uses their child's autism as an excuse to let them destroy things and potentially hurt people or themselves without accepting responsibility and taking steps to find coping mechanisms, is failing their child. A big thing amongst mental illness and neurodevelopmental disorders is that your disease can explain negative behavior or actions, but it doesn't excuse it and MIL is excusing it.", "Thank you <3", "We told my sister to not invite her, because if we had told her the same thing would of played out.
