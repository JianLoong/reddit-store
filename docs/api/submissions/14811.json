Original post is in the comments I think. First time using Reddit, thank you anyone interacting!))\n\nMy husband (M42) and I (F35) have been married for 6 years, together for 8. My MIL has been part of our life since we've been together and we have always included her and our BIL in our lives when possible until our wedding.\n\nFor quick clarrification, my BIL (M38) lives with my MIL (F61). He's very high on the autistic spectrum and has violent outbursts when overstimulated. He's typically overstimulated by large crowds or \"loud eating noises\" (I'm not sure how else to word it. My husband says it's a sensory disorder called Misophonia). My MIL \"takes care\" of my BIL, but has always had the tendacy to try and excuse his actions, as well as ignore his outbursts rather than comfort him. \n\nDuring our wedding, my BIL became overstimulated and destroyed our wedding cake as well as other foods on display by pulling our table cloth off our display table and knocking said table over. My MIL called me selfish and a whore for becoming upset at this and became frustrated when my husband kicked them out. Since this event, my husband has kept his mom out of my life, but in his just to keep in contact with his brother (a decision we made together).\n\nTo the reason for the post: My husband and I found out I was pregnant a few months ago. I've always wanted to celebrate my first pregnancy with a nice baby shower, and to have my sister surprise me with the gender. My sister and I decided on this, and we worked on a guest list together but both agreed MIL and BIL would not be invited. However, my sister made the giant mistake of posting about the event on her Facebook for family members, forgetting she had MIL friended. \n\nThe day of the baby shower/gender reveal party, my husband and I were both shocked to see my MIL/BIL at the party. As soon as she came up to us, I tried to explain the gender reveal involved balloons and a sort of loud confetti cannon, and that the food choices would likely be too much for BIL (mainly crunchy/loud foods). I suggested she leave with BIL, or stay inside during the celebration to avoid any outbursts. This immediately turned into an arguement, her main point being to call me selfish for not giving BIL a chance. My husband jumped in and tried talking us both down. Of course, the argument became too much for BIL as it got louder and both MIL and BIL had to be brought out by other family members. \n\nAfter this happened, my ML contacted me and told me I didn't deserve her son nor the children I'd be having (twin boys). My husband and I are discussing a stronger way to cut connection with his mother, the biggest struggle being how close we live to her.\n\nAITA for not giving BIL and MIL a chance at my gender reveal party to try and avoid distaster?\n\nEDIT: I'm not an asshole for having a gender reveal party, and my choice to celebrate my baby's gender is not what this discussion is about. I'm not apologizing for that.", "created_utc": 1681505557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12md04u/aita_for_kicking_my_mil_and_bil_out_of_my_gender/", "score": 465, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We both decided my sister would learn the gender and host a gender reveal party for us (if she wanted), and she was extremely excited. We told her, however, not to invite my MIL and BIL (38).\nI have no problem with my BIL directly, but he's autistic and has extreme sensory issues mainly towards eating and becomes overwhelmed in large crowds or gatherings. He also has the tendacy to get angry when overstimulated, destroying things or screaming as a result. My MIL lets him do these things, and even made a mess at our wedding by calling me selfish for not inviting him to the event. It ended in our wedding cake on the floor from BIL freaking out and ripping a table cloth off our display table after MIL brought him to the wedding. She had the audicity after the mess to baby him and call me a whore for being upset, and has been passive aggresive towards me ever since. \nBack to the plans. My sister set up the baby shower/gender reveal. We connected with family about the news and party, and my sister posted about the event on her Facebook to draw the attention of some family members who didn't check messages. However, you can probably already guess that my MIL saw this and took it as an invite. \nThe day of the baby shower, my husband and I were both shocked to see his mom and brother show up and come straight towards us. I immediately felt anxious. Before either could say anything, I very softly asked them to leave because it'd be too loud for BIL. Most of our food choices were crunchy and my sister's reveal plan involved balloons and a confetti cannon. and I explained that to MIL. She instantly began to argue, telling me she had a right to be at the event and so did BIL, and that I was a bitch for not even giving him a chance. My husband tried to step in, and the whole arguement became a lot louder and longer than it needed to be, sending BIL into a freak out episode. Before he could do anything, my sister and dad worked together to get both of them out of my backyard. \nA few days after this event, my MIL sent me a long message telling me I didn't deserve her son nor our babies (we're having twin boys!) and that I had no right to treat her and BIL the way I did.\nAITA for not giving BIL/MIL a chance and kicking them out?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She sounds very entitled and uncaring about the damage your  BIL can do.", "This isn't on anybody but your sister. She's the one who couldn't follow directions so why are you mad at the MIL and BIL and not her. Your sister is the AH", "NTA\n\nYour MIL shows she really doesn\u2019t care about either of her children.  She forces your BIL to go places he will be uncomfortable and at the expense of your husband.

Seems the lesser evil with the risk MIL poses. \n\nThere was no need for a FB post about this if avoiding a repeat of the wedding was a concern. \n\nMIL is terrible and no judgement if Op goes NC, but seems it was an easily avoidable situation. \n\nOP is NTA, but when dealing with this kind of MiL and drama you need to be less careless about shared information.

Also the fact is OP's BIL is autstic and that means that participating in some activities, even with all the planning and support in the world, may unfortunately not be possible due to extreme discomfort/overstimulation. \n\nI once had a kid in summer camp who was autistic and he HATED bugs and would scream, cry, run away, and throw things if he saw them and couldn't get away from them. After 2 (5 hour long) lake trips with the camp of him crying, trying to run away, and screaming for his mom and about the bugs we spoke with his parents and all decided it would probably be best if he wasn't made to go on these trips until mom and dad tried with him and found a way to make it more comfortable for him, because it was clear it was more detrimental than beneficial for him at that point.\n\nI'm assuming MIL is BIL's caretaker, which means she as much as she may want to be a part of these celebrations, it is her responsibility not to bring son to places that are the definition of all his triggers knowing full well his reaction will be destructive because A) she shouldn't want to be making either of her children that uncomfortable. It's just cruel to intentionally put people in situations that will make them freak out. B) she doesn't seem to have any type of autistic meltdown calming rituals to be seen or heard of anywhere, which is just irresponsible. And C) she should care about ruining people's important events by excusing what is extremely inappropriate behaviors to exhibit at those events (kinda like bringing your kid to a movie theater and letting it scream through the whole movie instead of removing yourself and calming your child before re-entering)", ">You want to avoid a pattern of bad behavior.

Fact is that you seem to comprehend that there are environments that don't work with your BIL's autism and that his caretaker should be helping him cope or not bringing him at all so he's not uncomfortable, because those are the healthy options. Your MIL is not supporting your BIL in a healthy way or giving him any tools for success in regards to these situations, which if your boys end up on the spectrum I don't think will be the case with you. Any parent who puts their child intentionally into a stressful situation and uses their child's autism as an excuse to let them destroy things and potentially hurt people or themselves without accepting responsibility and taking steps to find coping mechanisms, is failing their child.

It doesn\u2019t help anyone to ignore that BiL has specific issues which can be avoided with planning but which makes certain events unsuitable for him. If he is distressed by crowds and loud noises then a wedding or baby shower with a confetti cannon will be far too much for him.

Especially around the babies when they are young. Little ones are loud, spontaneous and don\u2019t understand social cues so could easily trigger BiL by crying or some other way. Keep doing separate events where sometimes BiL can come if it\u2019s something he will enjoy but other times acknowledge he won\u2019t have a good time and let him chill.
