{"id": 6381, "submission_id": "1028xx9", "title": "AITA for borrowing my husbands underwear?", "selftext": "So I (28f) am about 7-8 months pregnant and while I've thankfully not gained a lot of weight, my belly has grown a lot and I find that most of my underwear is too small and cuts into my sides/bottom of my belly. After a while I started getting a rash in the places where it was too tight due to friction I guess.\n\nSo one day I was getting dressed and I was getting frustrated about the rash and the underwear being too small, so I figured I'd try on a pair of my husbands (29m) boxers. They're size L and too big for me, but OMG it was the most comfortable thing I've ever tried on in my life. Breezy and loose and even the places where I had the rash didn't hurt. My husband had already left for work for the day, so I decided to just borrow them.\n\nAt the end of the day we both come home and I tell him that I borrowed his underwear and asked if it was okay to continue borrowing some until the baby comes (less than 2 months left) or at least until the rash is better. He seemed a bit weirded out but said it was okay.\n\nFast forward a few days and we're going to bed and he flips out at me and asks me why I'm wearing his \"good\" bamboo underwear. I'm confused, but he points at the band where it says bamboo. Then he goes on a long rant about how his few pairs of bamboo underwear are the comfiest and best quality etc etc (I swear this is not an ad for bamboo underwear). I apologized and said I just picked the pair off the top just like I did the other times, but he was upset and said I wasn't allowed to borrow his underwear anymore.\n\nI said I wouldn't borrow the ones that said bamboo on them since it bothered him, but he just drew a hard line saying I should go buy bigger underwear for myself and stop stealing his.\n\nNow, I'm thinking this is probably more about how he actually doesn't want me to borrow his underwear, and he's using me accidentally taking the \"wrong\" pair as an excuse, but I'm not sure.\n\nWhile I can understand not wanting to share your underwear, I also think it's unneccesary to go out and buy a bunch of large pairs of womens underwear that will be used for maybe 2 months at most. I also think it shouldn't be that big of a deal since I'm the one who washes and folds his underwear anyway, and he has about a hundred pairs, so it's not like he'll run out of them. \n\nAnd I also kinda feel like since I work full time, buy all groceries, cook and clean ON TOP OF CARRYING OUR BABY (with everything that includes such as physical changes to my body) him having to lend me his underwear is a small price to pay to help out with the pregnancy.\n\nI also bought him 8 more pairs of bamboo underwear as an apology but he still doesn't seem to want to share his regular pairs with me. Maybe I should've been petty and bought them for myself instead. Hehe.\n\nSo anyway reddit, AITA for thinking my husband should let me borrow his underwear?

You absolutely should NOT be letting him shirk a fair share of cooking and cleaning without any consequences or discussion. If you both work full time, other chores need to be split fairly too. Not dumped on the woman due to outdated misogynistic thinking. It's no wonder you fixated on the underwear as a thing he should be doing for you when it seems like he does almost nothing supportive. He sucks extra that you are heavily pregnant currently. He should be doing more then for sure. \n\nMy advice would be to sit him down and say sorry for the underwear thing and then just calmly tell him you need more equal support in the home. Be direct and clear that the imbalance in chores needs to be addressed more fairly moving forward. If you feel you have other unmet needs, voice those directly too. \n\nAll of this is assuming your husband is simply out of touch with what a healthy relationship looks like and not actively misogynistic. If he is that way, you may need to take a harder look at your options and if trying to change things is safe to do. I hope he's just the out of touch kind and can be reasoned with.\n\nGood luck!

You deserve to wear what's comfortable and he deserves to say who uses his underwear.
