{"id": 6381, "submission_id": "1028xx9", "title": "AITA for borrowing my husbands underwear?", "selftext": "So I (28f) am about 7-8 months pregnant and while I've thankfully not gained a lot of weight, my belly has grown a lot and I find that most of my underwear is too small and cuts into my sides/bottom of my belly. After a while I started getting a rash in the places where it was too tight due to friction I guess.\n\nSo one day I was getting dressed and I was getting frustrated about the rash and the underwear being too small, so I figured I'd try on a pair of my husbands (29m) boxers. They're size L and too big for me, but OMG it was the most comfortable thing I've ever tried on in my life. Breezy and loose and even the places where I had the rash didn't hurt. My husband had already left for work for the day, so I decided to just borrow them.\n\nAt the end of the day we both come home and I tell him that I borrowed his underwear and asked if it was okay to continue borrowing some until the baby comes (less than 2 months left) or at least until the rash is better. He seemed a bit weirded out but said it was okay.\n\nFast forward a few days and we're going to bed and he flips out at me and asks me why I'm wearing his \"good\" bamboo underwear. I'm confused, but he points at the band where it says bamboo. Then he goes on a long rant about how his few pairs of bamboo underwear are the comfiest and best quality etc etc (I swear this is not an ad for bamboo underwear). I apologized and said I just picked the pair off the top just like I did the other times, but he was upset and said I wasn't allowed to borrow his underwear anymore.\n\nI said I wouldn't borrow the ones that said bamboo on them since it bothered him, but he just drew a hard line saying I should go buy bigger underwear for myself and stop stealing his.\n\nNow, I'm thinking this is probably more about how he actually doesn't want me to borrow his underwear, and he's using me accidentally taking the \"wrong\" pair as an excuse, but I'm not sure.\n\nWhile I can understand not wanting to share your underwear, I also think it's unneccesary to go out and buy a bunch of large pairs of womens underwear that will be used for maybe 2 months at most. I also think it shouldn't be that big of a deal since I'm the one who washes and folds his underwear anyway, and he has about a hundred pairs, so it's not like he'll run out of them. \n\nAnd I also kinda feel like since I work full time, buy all groceries, cook and clean ON TOP OF CARRYING OUR BABY (with everything that includes such as physical changes to my body) him having to lend me his underwear is a small price to pay to help out with the pregnancy.\n\nI also bought him 8 more pairs of bamboo underwear as an apology but he still doesn't seem to want to share his regular pairs with me. Maybe I should've been petty and bought them for myself instead. Hehe.\n\nSo anyway reddit, AITA for thinking my husband should let me borrow his underwear?

You absolutely should NOT be letting him shirk a fair share of cooking and cleaning without any consequences or discussion. If you both work full time, other chores need to be split fairly too. Not dumped on the woman due to outdated misogynistic thinking. It's no wonder you fixated on the underwear as a thing he should be doing for you when it seems like he does almost nothing supportive. He sucks extra that you are heavily pregnant currently. He should be doing more then for sure. \n\nMy advice would be to sit him down and say sorry for the underwear thing and then just calmly tell him you need more equal support in the home. Be direct and clear that the imbalance in chores needs to be addressed more fairly moving forward. If you feel you have other unmet needs, voice those directly too. \n\nAll of this is assuming your husband is simply out of touch with what a healthy relationship looks like and not actively misogynistic. If he is that way, you may need to take a harder look at your options and if trying to change things is safe to do. I hope he's just the out of touch kind and can be reasoned with.\n\nGood luck!

You deserve to wear what's comfortable and he deserves to say who uses his underwear.

Your husband did however over react to this situation and one apology should have been sufficient.", "umm. You should just buy your own. You borrowed someone's underwear without asking and asked for forgiveness rather than permission when he got home\n\nNTA here because you asked afterwards and then he agreed.\n\nBut I still do not understand why you can't go online and buy basic boxers for yourself. Two months isn't a short period of time.\n\nAnd he got upset about something he hadn't explained. He should have said \"Yes. But not my expensive brands please\"\n\nIf someone had borrowed my underwear, even after washed, I WOULD NOT want them back. That's just me though. \n\nIt's kind of a weird situation.

He clearly isn't comfortable with sharing his underwear. But instead of being upfront and honest about how he feels, he's being passive aggressive and not very sympathetic to the woman carrying his child. But honestly, I wouldn't be okay with sharing my underwear either. Especially not with a woman in the late stages of her pregnancy.\n\nIt's not unusual for people to have accidents when they are late in their pregnancy or recently gave birth. It's normal and not something to be ashamed of but it's probably not something you wanna do in borrowed undies. And your body most likely isn't going to immediately return to its normal size so you'll probably be in these underwear for more than two months. \n\nLastly, you are already sharing your body with another human being. At the very least, you deserve underwear that you dont have to share. Treat yourself to some good quality underwear with a fun print or something.", "YTA", "YTA. Just buy maternity underwear.

He should have communicated that he doesn't want you to wear his underwear. It's okay for him to not want that but he should have.

He should definitely be a little more mature about communicating his needs, but wanting his own underwear to stay his underwear doesn\u2019t make him an AH and you coming on here and making him sound like he is for using his fancy underwear as \u201can excuse\u201d to get you to stop using them is what makes you TAH, but again, not a huge one. Also, buy the maternity underwear!! You think you\u2019ll only wear them for two months, but I have worn my maternity underwear well past the delivery of each one of my kids and your hips and things aren\u2019t likely to magically snap back so you may be in great need for larger underwear after the baby and will be glad you have a stash of them for the foreseeable future.\n\nEta a few missing words.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou are wearing underwear that is comfy for you, that'e fine, but I don't really understand why you didn't just buy some of your own instead of using his.\n\nI have to say, I would be surprised if any wife would be happy for their husbands to use their underwear in the same way and giving the same reason.", "YTA.

How many hours per week does he spend on the outside \"chores\"? What does that average out to per week for the entire year? How much time are you spending per week on \"inside\" chores? I can almost guarantee that per week, in the summer, he's still spending less time on household chores than you are per week, and that only lasts a few months maximum. He's contributing next to nothing to the household upkeep.

Is this the life you want for yourself? \n\nIf you want to have any hope of things changing for the better, you need to figure out real quick what you're willing to accept and what you expect from him and sit down with him and talk to him about the current division of labor and what you expect going forward. There are some great chore planning/ tracking resources out there that you can use to find a fair division of household labor. \n\nYes, you two should be a team and ideally figure this out together, but you have to value yourself and make it known that you are not going to pay 50s housewife while also working to support the family.

And now we've gone high-waisted uber alles it's WORSE.\n\nEven if I am willing to compromise on breathability for the sake of some s3x appeal... no nice sexy practical black.\n\nNot every woman wants white (that will be grey in 2 washes) or some dingy plain ugly-a$$ pink clone (that will be dingey in 4 washes) or beige/palest possibly grey (that might last 6) FFS.  \n\n\nThe only place you find black? The s3x game lingerie. Which is cool and all, but sometimes I'd like to land between '5 years old', 'f\\*ck me doll' and '99, couldn't care' with some dignity, you know?\n\nSome of us are grown ups. Lets us wear grown up colors, or find some whimsy. There's GOT to be middle ground somewhere between 'for 5 year olds', 'for 80 year olds', and 'My Nan made these from her 1960s curtains' for crying out loud!", "Describing ribbons as \u201cuseless\u201d is too kind. They actively make the underwear worse.", "I love tomboyX! I started with their period underwear, and would add something on sale. I love the bras, the undies, the fabric, the patterns. So wonderful and no \u201chis and hers\u201d all the styles are for everyone!", "I will have to look into these. I was shopping for underwear recently, and why is every style a \"cheeky\"?!?!

And don\u2019t forget you was your underwear daily!", "I dont think you know about fecal matter....", "Whoa whoa, he has borrowed your TOOTHBRUSH? And he is being a butt (intended) about underwear?? I already thought NTA but seriously. NTA.", "She wore them first, then asked.", "Yea she should have asked. But that she did after the first one and he said OK makes her so minimally TA that it's still NTA imo. Of course he has the right to feel uncomfortable but he should have said that rather than stewing on it for ages then lashing out. Once she apologised and bought him 8 new pairs, I really think he should have given her some of his older pairs as a decent husband of a very uncomfortable pregnant wife. But that could be me taking the side of OP because I've been pregnant, I might not be being the most objective. \n\n\nIt's a weird one. I'd be totally grossed out if anyone, family/friends etc, borrowed my underwear but my husband? Wouldn't bother me at all, especially if he was unbearably uncomfortable wearing his own.", "She's also expected to work FT and do all the cooking and cleaning. And probably the parenting too.", "He said it was ok and she stopped when he said it wasn\u2019t. What are you talking about", "Did you miss the part where she said she bought underwear for him to apologize. She said after it that she wishes that she kept them herself because her db husband still doesn\u2019t want to share. The least he could\u2019ve don\u2019t is tell her to keep those pairs so she could wear them but no he accepted it and now the pregnant wife stil has a problem. She is carrying his whole ass baby and the majority of the housework apparently he should be more considerate because these small things he refuses to do will boil over and he will end up divorced because he never learned to share or show some support.", "I didn\u2019t say it was. If she\u2019s doing all of the household labor it wouldn\u2019t kill him to let him borrow something. Weird comment.", "Why can\u2019t the husband buy his own toothbrush?", "I agree with you (and I\u2019m someone who has been pregnant.) I what makes OP TA is not asking first. \n\nI get it - I wore my husband\u2019s basketball shorts all the time after I had my kids because none of my shorts fit, I didn\u2019t want to buy new and it was too fucking hot to wear even yoga pants. But I didn\u2019t just want into his closet and grab them, I asked first. \n\nAnd I get that she didn\u2019t want to spend money, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019d go to waste. I worked at a place that commonly had men\u2019s boxers go on clearance and I\u2019d always buy them - they\u2019re great for lounging around the house or for doing stuff you don\u2019t want to do in your normal shorts like painting.", "True, in which case he should have said calmly that he isn\u2019t comfortable with this arrangement. Not let it bother him for a while and then seemingly out of nowhere be angry about it.", "It\u2019s definitely good to find what is comfortable. I loved my Old Navy ones.", "It really is amazing I feel sexiest in my bfs clothes I also think he looks might fine in mine tbh:) I think it's partly on how we feel in clothes because often if a article of clothing makes you feel insecure people will notice or if s piece of clothing makes you feel incredibly sexy people will also notice", "Woah what?? Where lmao. I\u2019ve only been able to find different colored underwear in plus sized. No fun prints", "I feel you, the majority of my undergarments are actually black. I only buy black bras. Because the others just go dingy or get stained up. I typically only get patterns if they\u2019re on sale. You c a n find just black practical panties that aren\u2019t for grandma, but they\u2019re usually expensive and not sold in packs. Nor are they good quality. Which is great for getting on clearance, but just not durable. Im sure there are some more expensive ones that are quality, I just haven\u2019t found them. I bought some black Savage X Fenty panties, they all suck, and the sizing is inconsistent. I got two pairs, of similar material, in the same size. One is almost too tight and the others fall right off me.", "I love men who are themselves overweight and expect their wives to be a size 00 model.

You just have to replace every few weeks.", "if there's a significant amount of fecal matter in your undies then you have bigger problems.", "I don't think you know about washing machines....", "Well I believe most people throw their undies into the washing machine after each use.", "Oh, does that not wash off?  Are you wearing your fecal matter after each wash?  And again, as gross as it may be, there\u2019s *more potential*  fecal matter when you\u2019re using you hand and mouth and penis down there. But it feels good so you ignore it. Or you take a shower before, which I was under the impression was similar to a washing machine, but for your body.", "The underwear is clean though....", "I don't think you know about washing machines....", "Good point .. plus women's vaginas are highly acidic and can bleach undies. And people get all gross and sweaty down there.", "i can tolerate sharing undies, unless theyre full of skiddy stains... \n\nbut a toothbrush? fk that. ew. thats like flossing your ass with a thong after taking a dump, barely rinsing it, and sharing THAT with your partner.\n\nops husband is worried about cleanliness but will use her toothbrush? unless youre destroying his undies somehow it doesnt make sense to me. expensive ones i can understand, so why not set some aside for her or let her have her own? \n\nop claim some of the ones you bought for him, or buy extras. if you can buy 8 at a time to replace them, they cant be that expensive.\n\nwill use a toothbrush but not share undies.. tf no", "Good for you! There are many hygiene reasons to say no, it doesn\u2019t change your marriage status.

Maybe I'm weird, lmao.", "To add, the plus size Hot Topic stuff online is great and has the same sizing as torrid for cheaper (which is because they use the same manufacturer) \n\nSo if you like nerdy clothing, there you go!", "I have a bunch of different prints of the Cacique by Lane Bryant", "I think torrid does mostly prints.

That's it. And they're overpriced for the time they last, but at least they look like I'm a grown up. With some subtle lace, even. But yeah... as inconsistent as you'd expect and you know, I'd like to buy online. It's 2023.\n\nAll the 'good' brand lingerie I've found here seems to be nylon concoctions and g-string by default.

I\u2019m pretty sure she said it was like 1 in 10 patients.

Sharing clothes is incredibly intimate for me as well depending on the reason like I'll let a female friend borrow a skirt/dress/shirt for a party or sum but letting my bf wear my underwear would be weirder then again homies literally gotten me pregnant so lol", "In fact I believe they\u2019re still the same company!  Torrid was founded as a Hot Topic spin off.

Pregnancy brain is backed by science and begins around month 5 of pregnancy. It\u2019s not like she would rather save the money for the things they actually need for the baby. It\u2019s not like she was trying to do something nice by buying him new fancy underwear and putting his needs ahead yet again, to then just have him brush it off. Please note the heavy sarcasm. \n\nShe is being more than thoughtful. It would literally be nothing if she decided to stop doing his laundry and let him take over ONE responsibility \u2014 not even for the household but just for something that apparently only he is allowed to use. How is it fair to begin with that she has to wash and fold it but shouldn\u2019t dare utilize the things she puts effort into maintaining?", "Think we found the husband.", "The point is that people should help each other and shouldn\u2019t make relationships transactional.
