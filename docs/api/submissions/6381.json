After a while I started getting a rash in the places where it was too tight due to friction I guess.\n\nSo one day I was getting dressed and I was getting frustrated about the rash and the underwear being too small, so I figured I'd try on a pair of my husbands (29m) boxers. They're size L and too big for me, but OMG it was the most comfortable thing I've ever tried on in my life. Breezy and loose and even the places where I had the rash didn't hurt. My husband had already left for work for the day, so I decided to just borrow them.\n\nAt the end of the day we both come home and I tell him that I borrowed his underwear and asked if it was okay to continue borrowing some until the baby comes (less than 2 months left) or at least until the rash is better. He seemed a bit weirded out but said it was okay.\n\nFast forward a few days and we're going to bed and he flips out at me and asks me why I'm wearing his \"good\" bamboo underwear. I'm confused, but he points at the band where it says bamboo. Then he goes on a long rant about how his few pairs of bamboo underwear are the comfiest and best quality etc etc (I swear this is not an ad for bamboo underwear). I apologized and said I just picked the pair off the top just like I did the other times, but he was upset and said I wasn't allowed to borrow his underwear anymore.\n\nI said I wouldn't borrow the ones that said bamboo on them since it bothered him, but he just drew a hard line saying I should go buy bigger underwear for myself and stop stealing his.\n\nNow, I'm thinking this is probably more about how he actually doesn't want me to borrow his underwear, and he's using me accidentally taking the \"wrong\" pair as an excuse, but I'm not sure.\n\nWhile I can understand not wanting to share your underwear, I also think it's unneccesary to go out and buy a bunch of large pairs of womens underwear that will be used for maybe 2 months at most. I also think it shouldn't be that big of a deal since I'm the one who washes and folds his underwear anyway, and he has about a hundred pairs, so it's not like he'll run out of them. \n\nAnd I also kinda feel like since I work full time, buy all groceries, cook and clean ON TOP OF CARRYING OUR BABY (with everything that includes such as physical changes to my body) him having to lend me his underwear is a small price to pay to help out with the pregnancy.\n\nI also bought him 8 more pairs of bamboo underwear as an apology but he still doesn't seem to want to share his regular pairs with me. Maybe I should've been petty and bought them for myself instead. Hehe.\n\nSo anyway reddit, AITA for thinking my husband should let me borrow his underwear?

You absolutely should NOT be letting him shirk a fair share of cooking and cleaning without any consequences or discussion. If you both work full time, other chores need to be split fairly too. Not dumped on the woman due to outdated misogynistic thinking. It's no wonder you fixated on the underwear as a thing he should be doing for you when it seems like he does almost nothing supportive. He sucks extra that you are heavily pregnant currently. He should be doing more then for sure. \n\nMy advice would be to sit him down and say sorry for the underwear thing and then just calmly tell him you need more equal support in the home. Be direct and clear that the imbalance in chores needs to be addressed more fairly moving forward. If you feel you have other unmet needs, voice those directly too. \n\nAll of this is assuming your husband is simply out of touch with what a healthy relationship looks like and not actively misogynistic. If he is that way, you may need to take a harder look at your options and if trying to change things is safe to do. I hope he's just the out of touch kind and can be reasoned with.\n\nGood luck!

Also, buy the maternity underwear!! You think you\u2019ll only wear them for two months, but I have worn my maternity underwear well past the delivery of each one of my kids and your hips and things aren\u2019t likely to magically snap back so you may be in great need for larger underwear after the baby and will be glad you have a stash of them for the foreseeable future.\n\nEta a few missing words.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou are wearing underwear that is comfy for you, that'e fine, but I don't really understand why you didn't just buy some of your own instead of using his.\n\nI have to say, I would be surprised if any wife would be happy for their husbands to use their underwear in the same way and giving the same reason.", "YTA.

He is \"the man\" and his wants come before your needs and it won't get better by simply hoping he'll change.\n\nLook at the current division of labor. How many hours per week does he spend on the outside \"chores\"? What does that average out to per week for the entire year? How much time are you spending per week on \"inside\" chores? I can almost guarantee that per week, in the summer, he's still spending less time on household chores than you are per week, and that only lasts a few months maximum. He's contributing next to nothing to the household upkeep. It will be the same with the baby.\n\nBefore your know it, he'll expect you to be grateful that he took care of the baby for you for a couple hours while you went and got groceries. You'll have to ask him to \"help\" you with anything related to the baby, all while you maintain the home and continue working. Don't forget, you have to stay attractive to him, too. Is this the life you want for yourself? \n\nIf you want to have any hope of things changing for the better, you need to figure out real quick what you're willing to accept and what you expect from him and sit down with him and talk to him about the current division of labor and what you expect going forward. There are some great chore planning/ tracking resources out there that you can use to find a fair division of household labor. \n\nYes, you two should be a team and ideally figure this out together, but you have to value yourself and make it known that you are not going to pay 50s housewife while also working to support the family. That doesn't make you a good wife, it makes you a doormat. Don't raise your child thinking that kind of dynamic is acceptable. Having a baby without some kind of changes from your husband is going to make keeping up with everything so much harder than it is now.", "I know relationships are complicated, but it sounds like you're not getting the support that any pregnant person deserves.

Please get your own underwear,\" or \"sure, but not the Bamboo ones,\" when you initially asked, or \"I changed my mind, and I would like you to stop wearing my underwear,\" later on.

I'm not sure it rises to the level of AH (my official vote is NAH), but it does warrant a conversation. \n\nThis is a pretty low stakes issue, but it's worth using it as an opportunity to talk about how you can improve your communication. Maybe he felt silly saying no. Maybe he felt you had already assumed permission and your ask felt more like a statement of intention than an honest inquiry. (\"You don't mind, do you? No, of course you don't!\") \n\nNow, all that said, if the issue is really that he doesn't like you wearing men's clothing and he wants to police what you wear, that's a much bigger problem that is very separate from whether or not he cares if you borrow HIS clothing.", "I may or may not have put a sausage (wrapped of\ncourse) in the boxers I was wearing once to give him a good laugh hahaha I love that you call it a dong pouch too!", "NTA\n\nOP, your husband is a giant Ahole and it sounds like he's completely baby trapped you.

I have a few fancy pairs that have an even bigger bow at the top of the butt and some that have bows at the leg holes they're freaking adorable", "THIS. I buy underwear for butt coverage, not to have a string of lace stuck in my butt crack all day.", "All I wear now is tomboy! I love them.", "I buy these for my enby teen. They're pricey enough that I don't buy them for myself, but as soon as said teen is on their own, I'm getting Tomboy X for me! \n\nAlso, they last *forever*! So your initial outlay is higher, but you don't have to replace them nearly as quickly, so your total cost over time isn't higher.", "Haha I was pissed too. Giant tits run in my family (my mom had double Gs before her breast reduction and she still has bra strap indentations on her shoulders after decades of having enormous boobs) and I was in denial about mine growing, so I wore big black shirts with no bra for a few years. Mine ended up being ginormous too, and I got a breast reduction when I was 19. I was so mad about all of it!", "Wait until he finds out how unsexy giving birth is\u2026 unless he\u2019s into that in which case, run", "Right? But whatever.", "I wouldn\u2019t necessarily blame the sub for my post being further down. I think that\u2019s on me, because I just keep scrolling until I find a comment that I think is worth responding to no matter how deeply buried it gets. \n\nI understand what you\u2019re talking about though. It does take some effort to realize what included behaviors/information/situations do or do not directly relate to the topic at hand to make the best judgement that you can. I\u2019m definitely not immune to making emotional/biased comments, but I try my best.", "Cheek Boss. From small up to 4X and in so many prints and colors. Super buttery soft, stretchy, and no rough itchy band around the waist or legs. I'm 7 months pregnant and never had to buy new underwear because these are the BEST. (I will add that because the seams are mostly held together via heat seal they MUST be washed/dried on delicate cycles with low or no extra heat.", "I buy all of my undies from Tomboy. They're unisex and come in a bunch of styles, sizes, and prints. They are $$ but worth it. The most comfortable underwear I've ever worn. \n\nThey have sales often so I buy then.\n\nEditing to add\nThey go up to size 6x I believe.", "Torrid and Lane Bryant both have adorable/fun prints", "Sadly don't seem to be out here, but thanks for the  tip!  \n\n\nThey do look nice, but I fear a bit workaday for me. Probably my French heritage being pompous, but I do like a little more than 'basic black' in my undie drawer. That's the bit that's really getting me, TBH. It's all workaday plain stuff if you want breathable fabrics.", "I know it's the fashion lament of every replaced generation- but I do not understand what on earth made the otherwise smart Gen Z look at 'mom Jeans' and think 'gimme some of that'.\n\nThere's very few physiques it seems to flatter, yet it's all the rage. I get that hipster went a bit far for some bodies, but can we have low-rise... or at least mid-rise... back please? Not all of us want our pants to reach our nipples.\n\nAnd if someone could take 'paper bag waists' out the back and shoot them, that would be fantastic. I've never seen a single soul they flatter. Form rail thin to big, it just makes everyone look like utter cr@p. Who came up with that?", "Hmmm. Opposite for me. ANY pair of underwear goes up my butt. Boy shorts? Up my butt. Full coverage granny panties? Straight up the ass. I prefer thongs because it's much better having a little string in my buttcrack than a yard of fabric bunching on some briefs.", "My kid was a pretty great sleeper, only woke up once or twice a night. And I couldn\u2019t even take advantage of that, because has it been 15 or 20 minutes? Too much blood, now you\u2019re changing clothes and sheets or towels again. I really wish I had heard about using them for that or thinking of it myself. Not having to live in the bathroom would have been worth it.", "Me too, but only for like the first day. They gave me one pair and refused to bring me more. It was disappointing.", "I just pictured OP as a heavily pregnant Swiper...", "100% what she can expect", "Ye I realised after posting that this thread is actually OK and my annoyance seemed misguided lol. I do the same when replying to people tbf. \n\n\nI'm negative enough irl and trying to improve on that, which is why I'm deciding to hide subs that don't bring me any joy. For some reason this sub keeps popping up on my feed even though I usually don't engage with it.", "Torrid does have some good ones! I hadn\u2019t had cool character underwear since I was a kid, but now that I shop at Torrid I own a few fun pairs. Their smallest size is the equivalent of an adult medium. Life is too short for boring underwear - go get some fun pairs, y\u2019all!", "I love torrid but I draw the line at spending that much for a pair of underwear", "Really. My poor boobs already sag enough. I don\u2019t need the ability to tuck \u2018em in.", "That was my problem, too. And I was living in a hot climate and having the hem sit right where cheek meets thigh was causing chafing.\n\nOf the ones I listed above, Wirarpa (typo above) are the lowest cost. I got a 5-pack on the big A for about $20. The waist on them runs small but the legs stay put and they are pretty much wedgie-free. For all the other brands, I recommend getting the modal fabric. Thin and soft.", "Oh same lol. I had to get the grown up version of my kids yoga pants from old navy. They now come in flares too so I was kind of excited lol.", "I was huge with both kids so I bought my own bigger and still wore them after. Honestly I wouldnt want to get post birth blood on someone else's undiesz, especially since it would be longer then 2 months. Apparently the bamboo undies are expensive too", "Oh easy fix. All he has to do is say the magic phrase of swiper no swiping and he becomes immune to her thieving ways\u2026", "Sometimes, you\u2019re eating Ramen while reading AITA comments, sometimes it results in spitting your ramen broth across the table from laughing\u2026 this moment is sometimes \ud83d\ude06", "Right? Now I feel like most of their stuff is sad, work attire items. The edge is gone. =(", "Agreed about MeUndies. I had an ongoing joke with a boyfriend about not being willing to wear matching clothes, even for pics or family reunions. I don't think he even wanted to match, but once I said I refused he kept talking about it. So one year I bought us matching underwear from MeUndies. Those are still some of my favorite undies to wear! So soft and comfy.", "My wife loves to steal my pairs of meundies as loungewear since they're so soft. i have plenty, I really cant see where the harm is from OPs husband. its underpants and you two have had sex at least once so your junk has touched probably plenty?", "I also love meundies. Very soft and lots of fun prints. I don't understand why all their prints don't come in all their cuts tho. I wanted Oogie Boogie. I also really like torrid, but I only fit the smallest size. Both brands are kinda pricey, but worth it.", "okay legitimately are their regular undies okay? \nbecause I have gotten like 6 pairs of meundies thongs and oml. \nthey cut into my butt like nothing ever has. \nI have even sized up twice!!!", "Lol the trick is to wait for the sales", "I upvoted for the Mary Poppins reference", "I am a very long-in-the-torso person, my boobs make a decent attempt at staying in the chest area, and I haven't yet managed to buy a high rise ANYTHING that couldn't double as a bra in an emergency. I just don't get it.", "Why didn't you buy new underwear? I mean you buy maternity clothes.", "life is too short to be fighting about these things. both buy more underwear and move on.", "Just an FYI, once you give birth, your tummy will still be big for a few weeks, possibly months.  You will also be bleeding heavily and will have to use pads. You will need large, comfortable underwear that may get stained.", "A little ESH. He shouldn\u2019t have freaked out and agreed if he wasn\u2019t okay with it. You for not just buying your own. \n\nLook I get it. Buying new undies for 2 months use is a pain. But at the same time your going to have at least 6 weeks (or longer) of bleeding/recovery. You may not want to wear your regular underwear and chance them getting gross/fitting into them being tight. Also if you want more kids you can pack them with your maternity stuff for the next one. \nWith my first I held out as long as I could. It was a godsend having bigger undies with the giant ass pad during the after bleed. Than when I had my second and blew up faster I already had them ready to go and didn\u2019t have to worry. Now I use them on period days where I bloat like a balloon and just need some wiggle room.", "ESH - he should\u2019ve told you which pairs were off limits and you should back off once he tells you no \n\nAlso\u2026 you\u2019ll be wearing the big underpants for probably a couple months after the baby comes. And more if you have another baby. Just buy yourself a weeks worth and enjoy the comfort", "Buying and keeping underwear for yourself is not petty. It's exactly what he asked of you. And, unfortunately, buying things you will wear/use for only few months is one of the downsides if pregnancy. Many husbands would not take issue, but yours does. Get yourself your own underwear and get him to do more of the chores, if you are going to use them as a weapon.", "ESH. You should've bought underwear instead of just wearing too small underwear for so long that it gave you a rash. Him for being particular about underwear. \n\n>I also bought him 8 more pairs of bamboo underwear as an apology but he still doesn't seem to want to share his regular pairs with me. Maybe I should've been petty and bought them for myself instead. Hehe.\n\nSo you won't buy yourself underwear, but you'll buy apology undies? You won't \"snap back\" after having a baby it'll be better to have looser underwear while your vagina or stomach heal (in case of c- section). Just buy yourself underwear or boxers.", "Honestly the boxers wouldnt be the only thing Id replace if this was my husband. Mine is disabled and still does chores and teaches our kids to help out too.", "I mean, I think there's more info to be had here. Like him refusing to help out with chores is a lot different from them just doing different chores that are needed or choosing to do chores they enjoy (I know people who enjoy cooking so they insist on doing the shopping and cooking for the family.)", "I haven't really bought maternity clothes either to be fair ^^'... i bought 2 dresses, other than that I've been wearing my old dresses that are big and loose enough to fit my belly. The comments have made me realize I'm probably too cheap towards myself and I should just buy more things to make myself more comfortable!", "Seriously, this dude sounds like he sucks.", "One of the only reasonable responses in this entire thread. I feel sorry for the partners of people that said \u201cYTA\u201d, yikes!", "Yeah I agree with this. I\u2019ve lived with my partner for a couple years and idgaf what she wears of mine. I think it\u2019s cute. She wears my underwear when she\u2019s on her period because they\u2019re more comfy, etc. \n\nI guess everyone is allowed their quirks, but it seems really stupid to me, especially since it seems like she does all the heavy lifting around the house. I foresee him being a pain in the ass in the future.", "My therapist said we have a word for women who are unsupported by their partners, we call them \u201csuperwomen\u201d. It\u2019s not a badge of honor, it\u2019s a coping mechanism to deal with the bullshit and the patriarchy. We should never have to be super women, we should just be able to live like they do.", "Yeah especially during the later stages of pregnancy. Lots of women get a massive increase in this thin, watery discharge called leukaria. And with the acidity of the vaginal biome, it can often bleach stain underwear. Although I'd still vote NTA , since her husband said it was okay initially. But idk why OP didn't just go buy some men's underwear for herself as soon as she worked out that they were comfortable.", "She\u2019s literally carrying his child\u2026.grow up lol", "Wow that edit OP.\n\nHe better bring home bricks of gold to warrant the kind of caretaking you're doing for him and your soon-to-arrive baby. He can't wash is own underwear? So you're working, doing all the chores and housework, *and* dealing with pregnancy? \n\nWhat else does he do besides work?", "OP, i think it's time you make your husband take care of himself. The paragraph where you said you work full time and do all the chores made me side eye your dynamic and this added bit about the real reason he doesn't want you wearing his underwear kind of makes that worse? I don't find it funny that he won't let you wear his stuff because he's afraid you won't wash them (like you usually do anyway?) And he has to do it himself. Does he do anything for himself or the household?", "I don\u2019t know what\u2019s crazier to me\u2026 the \u201creal reason\u201d he doesn\u2019t want you to wear his underwear, or the fact that op is okay with it", ">he is scared I'll forget to do laundry and he'll run out of clean underwear and have to do laundry himself ;O!\n\n>\n\nI feel like this is toxic as shit lmao. Do you do all the chores around the house while he does none??\n\n>he's the kind of person who likes to have large stashes so of things so he never has to worry about them running out, especially things like candles for some reason...(he really likes candles...we have way too many candles stashed away).\n\n>\n\nAnd don't tell me you're the person who always has to buy these large stashes of things like candles...", "Why did you marry a child? Why would you be okay living the rest of your life with someone who is more concerned about getting out of doing the laundry than your wellbeing. Why would you be okay living the rest of your life with someone that doesn't contribute equally to the household??", "It\u2019s not, we in the gay community have done it forever. It\u2019s not like we don\u2019t clean it between wears", "Honestly as someone who has moderate OCD. I don't like other people wearing my clothes. Underwear and socks have to fit me properly. If they get stretched, I can't wear them, can't mentally get it out of my head.\n\nLook, I purchased larger maternity underwear with the nice tall band because I wore them PAST giving birth. Wore them as I had to use the huge-ass pads as I bled for weeks after giving birth and bled a bit from my cesarian scar (which got blood on the bands) and I knew I'd be tossing them. I do not think you're the asshole, as he could have just said no and stuck with no in the first place (you did say he was weirded out by it) but people can say no even for things you think shouldn't matter. I would honestly just talk about it with him, ask if he's uncomfortable with it, and just say \"Okay I won't wear them! :) \" And get some for yourself or just get the women's pregnancy ones! (Editing: calling you not sexy in them is wrong AF though, but I'm trying to look at the entire situation too)", "Another husband's perspective: I specifically offered my wife my larger boxers when I saw her only using boy short style or forgoing them altogether. I'm not much bigger than her, but they were way less constricting and she loved them. We just had to do laundry slightly more often so we didn't both run out. I don't know why your husband is insecure about sharing, but it's not that big of a deal. We trade shirts and hoodies too. Hell I've even been known to sleep in the same bed!", "comfortable enough to have a child with someone but flustered they wore your clothes\u2026.. yea that\u2019s pretty weird and over-dramatic.", "> 2 months max\n\nI bought maternity underwear when I was pregnant with my first child and tbh I still wear them like 5 years later haha. They fit fine when I\u2019m not pregnant and when I\u2019m 9 months pregnant, plus postpartum to hold a pad and whatnot. I really think op can loosen up on the purse strings and just make the \u201cinvestment\u201d in pregnancy undies. Definitely yta", "Lolol this is all I could think. She married a warm body with a working penis.", "Nailed it. I am shocked that more here are Missing This Point Completely.  At least you have 200 upvotes at this point so there's hope, I guess?\nAll I could think when reading this was 'Fire, Flames...Flames shooting up from the side of my head' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9LI9PaL_qQ", "> he doesn\u2019t find his underwear sexy on you.\n\nHow DARE she not be sexy so far along. Good grief!", "And she is gonna need larger undies once the baby comes. She ain't magically going to be back to prepregnancy waist line.

Your heavily pregnant and just minding your own business, who cares if your sexy or not\u2026", "Honestly this whole thing is making me mad and I\u2019m going to have to put down my phone after this. You\u2019re carrying his fucking child. You get to do whatever makes you comfortable. My partner and I love looking good for each other, but we\u2019re not going to look fantastic all the time. If he\u2019s pissed you don\u2019t look 100 for him every moment while you\u2019re doing the most of your family and home, and your body is changing drastically for your baby, then sorry not sorry, but he can fuck right off.", "Why do you care?!?

I've got underwear in every colour under the sun and I'm just a regular sized lady shopping at regular stores.", "Because no one ever has engaged in people-pleasing behavior and then regretted it."]}
