The family has been trying our best to support her in this time.\n\nThe other day she came to me because she had a plan for her birth. She already told everyone she was doing a homebirth, but she had something else she wanted to do. She wanted as many family members around as possible during the birth for support. She was asking everybody individually so there was no pressure. Apparently our parents, our other sister, our aunt and uncle, and a cousin are all on board. And of course my BIL.\n\nI said no right away. I don't think it would be appropriate first of all, this isn't really something you invite a sibling for in the first place. Plus TBH I don't think having half the family present is a good idea, newborns having no immune system and all. I really don't even understand why she would want anybody besides her husband and the midwife around, it isn't a spectator sport. \n\nI told her all of this, and she said ok, but looked very hurt. She explained that she was terrified about the whole thing to the point where she can't sleep, and having as many family as possible around she feels would help. I said fair enough but it still isn't something I feel comfortable doing. She stayed a bit longer before she went home, and then our mother called to tear me a knew one, and called me a bad brother.

Please though make your sister aware of how dangerous home births are. The reason people give birth in hospitals is to be next to a surgical suite in case baby would die without c-section (which happens more than you would think). Minutes matter here and can be the difference between a living baby and a dead one. Also there is always risk of the mother hemorrhaging blood in which case you need to be able to transfuse blood immediately or you risk the mom dying. Lastly, some babies struggle to breathe immediately postpartum and need interventions that are best provided in hospital. \n\nYour sister\u2019s tokophobia will only worsen if (god forbid) something goes wrong during the homebirth.

You're well within your rights to decide you don't want to be there yourself -- that's each person's choice. \n\nBut she's not doing anything unreasonable or even particularly unusual. Many cultures until very recently had a group of local women, family or friends of the new mother, attend births as well as the midwife. It was a good support system for the woman giving birth, and an education for young women who would almost certainly (in that time before reliable contraception) have to experience this themselves someday. Other cultures had whole extended families attend, all genders. \n\nToday we've largely limited the numbers simply because most babies are born in hospitals and hospitals have to have safety rules to keep the space from getting too crowded. But I had my husband, my midwife, my nurse, my doula, and my sister in the room with me when I had a hospital birth; so you can bring quite a few, including siblings. \n\nSo don't attend if you don't want to attend.

As a young man, you need to build the anticipation of having your own with your future wife when you're ready and excited over the idea. Watching your sisters could traumatize you and psychologically cripple you for a long time where you may not end up having your own until your way older because of it. That's what made me scared, watching someone give birth when i was not ready for it.

That would seem much less intrusive.\n\nIf she isn\u2019t already doing so, can you encourage your sister to seek therapy or counseling? Because this is a recipe for disaster otherwise.\n\nI encourage you to be supportive towards her fears. If you think she\u2019s making the wrong decision, absolutely discuss it.

It's completely normal and not weird at all. You stand at the head or leave the room during the pushing.

I'm not sure where you got this idea.\n\n>I really don't even understand why she would want anybody besides her husband and the midwife around\n\nYour sister literally explained to you why she wants more people around - for distraction and support. What's hard to understand about that?\n\nIf you don't want to watch a birth, that's completely fine. You are allowed to have that preference and not attend.\n\nBut instead of stating that outright, you're hating on your sister for expressing her wants and needs and trying to convince her that those aren't even her wants and needs? Or that her wants and needs are somehow inappropriate?\n\nThat behavior is what makes YTA.", "INFO - I don't understand your objection about it being an inappropriate invitation. It might be better if you explain what's inappropriate about it or explain why YOU are uncomfortable being there. You may have legitimate reasons for not wishing to attend.\n\nI would cringe if my sister asked this of me, but I'd also give it some serious thought.\n\nIf you don't think you'll be able to tolerate her being in pain, may react inappropriately when a complication arises, don't think you'll be able to handle the stress, or are squeamish about the sight of blood - these are all good reasons to consider not attending, since those things make you a liability during delivery. The fact that you told her it was inappropriate makes me question what you'll say to her or the midwife or other supporters if you attend should you see something you don't understand or makes you uncomfortable.\n\nSaying it's inappropriate to invite you makes YTA. It isn't inappropriate. It just makes you uncomfortable. \n\nIt isn't unheard of especially when there's no expectation of complications. But the number of people who attend shouldn't be \"as many family members as possible\" if you have a large family. I'm sure the midwife is helping with the arrangements and will cull the list if it looks out of hand. \n\nYour concerns about exposing a newborn are valid.  If you choose to go and support your sister, you'll all need to be up to date on your vaccinations several weeks before the birth, not have even the slightest case of sniffles, practice good hand hygiene, etc.\n\nCome to terms with why you're uncomfortable with this.  There are plenty of valid reasons to excuse yourself politely. And do excuse yourself politely if you must.", "YTA. Not because you are not comfortable being there, but because all of the judgment, you are throwing on her. You clearly are not a supportive sibling at all.", "YTA. It is perfectly okay for you to feel uncomfortable being there and say no based on that. But you were way out of line being so judgmental.", "YTA. Not for not going - you definitely shouldn't go if you're not comfortable. You're not a bad brother for not attending. It sounds like your sister understands this and specifically tried to make sure to not pressure anyone to attend while asking. You could have given a polite no and this would have easily been a N-A-H. \n\nBut you were absolutely an asshole for *scolding her* for asking for this support from her loved ones. This isn't \"inappropriate\", and people do invite family members to be with them when they give birth if they feel that family member will ease their mind and support them. It doesn't matter that you don't \"understand\" why she would want this, since *she's the one giving birth and not you*. She's going to be going something extremely intense, painful, and terrifying, and *she* thinks that having family with her to support her will help *her* get through this. How on earth could you think that it's remotely relevant that you personally wouldn't feel comforted by that? As for the immune system thing, folks who are attending can quarantine/test first, wear masks, etc. I think you were kind of being facetious with that \"concern\" when it's really about *your* discomfort with the idea.\n\nAlso it's genuinely nasty of you to use the \"birth isn't a spectator sport\" phrase *against the woman giving birth* to try to convince her that it's \"inappropriate\" to ask for support for loved ones. That phrase is supposed to be for women who *want* *privacy* and need to set boundaries with people who are insisting on being there to \"watch\" even though she doesn't want them there.
