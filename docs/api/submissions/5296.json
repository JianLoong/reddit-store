We moved in together about 2 months ago and I've noticed she barely showers, maybe twice or even once a week. I was pretty surprised because I've never noticed that she smelled or that her hair was greasy or anything like that in the time I've known her. Cleanliness is really important to me and I shower every day and wash my hair every other day. I dont expect her to wash her hair as frequently as I do because I know it takes her a really long time to wash it, but when she isn't washing her hair she doesn't shower at all.  \n\n\nLately I feel gross all the time around her knowing that she doesn't shower that much. Like I said, she doesn't smell, she isn't dirty or anything, but its like knowing someone just came out of the bathroom without washing their hands.  \nI didn't say anything at first because I initially thought that my showering every day would remind her to do so more frequently, but that didn't work, so at one point last week we were talking and I mentioned that I'd like her to shower more. This is where I might be the asshole - she got really embarrassed and asked me if she smelled. I said no, but then she launched into a torrent of 'Are you sure?' 'Then what's the issue?' 'Do I look/feel dirty?'. I was really tired and didn't feel like putting up with the questions. I know she doesn't like to do things unless she has a really solid, definitive reason and I wasn't sure that me just generally being icked out would do the trick, so eventually I just told her yes, fine, you do smell. She asked if she'd smelled the whole past year we've been together and I just said yes.   \n\n\nShe's started showering every morning, and I've also noticed she bought a bunch of new perfumes and deodorants for herself. Now I feel sort of guilty for essentially lying to her to get her to shower and potentially opening up a new insecurity for her.

Maybe you should have asked if there was a reason she doesn't shower everyday.  I personally believe in showering daily, but I know there are people who don't for various reasons.  If she didn't smell, perhaps she was still doing something else to assure she was still being hygienic.  I don't really get it myself, but yea, you shouldn't have lied to her...", "YTA.\n\nYou lied to her, and you know you lied to her, in order to manipulate her to take a shower every day. You made her doubt her own reality because she didn't smell herself before--so she now thinks it's because something is wrong with her sense of smell, when really it's because you lied to her.\n\nIt's actually gaslighting in the classic sense, although in your case i think it stems from your own difficulty in communication. Ask yourself why you didn't just talk about the actual issue--you yourself have a thing about cleanliness and germs, and would like her to shower more. She doesn't smell or look unclean, but as you said, to you, it's like not washing your hands after the toilet. There are many ways you could've approached this, including taking baths/showers together, just saying you love the smell of fresh soap on her, buying her a few scents you love, or just telling her the truth -- but you instead chose to manipulate her to feel insecure about herself over a fiction, so that she would shower every day like you want. I hope you address that in the future, because you cannot build a healthy relationship on manipulation & disrespect.", "Absolutely YTA.\n\nDude, people don't actually need to shower daily. It can damage your skin through the loss of natural oils, and as long as she's using deodorant and washing regularly to prevent odors, she's FINE.\n\nYou are an immature and selfish AH for projecting your insecure hangups and LITERALLY lying to her.\n\nHope she dumps you.", "YTA for lying to her, and also for judging her.   Not everyone showers every day.  \n\nI'm assuming at your age, you don't realize that some people have a natural biome that helps keep their skin and hair healthy, and reduces the need to shower daily.  She may have less bacteria on her skin that produces body odor enzymes.", "YTA for being a manipulative girlfriend. You tricked her into doing what made you more comfortable.

Your relationship will not last if you continue to problem solve in this manner.", "YTA you judgy little liar you", "YTA. There is nothing dirty about showering less often, but you hang up on it.  That\u2019s YOUR hang up; not hers.  But you made it hers by lying.  You need to come clean (pun intended) and apologize.", "YTA. So, you lied to her to make her feel embarrassed of herself just so that you... what? Had the satisfaction of knowing she showers every day? Well, if she doesn't sweat and accumulate dirt, what purpose would showering accomplish? People shower to get clean. For the vast majority of people, showering every day is a necessity to stay clean. For her, evidently, it's not. Why force your way of life onto her?", "YTA. Showering every day is a very American concept, I was very surprised when I learned about this.

You lied and gaslit her. Lord knows what else you do to the poor woman", "YTA, you state she didn't smell. She didn't feel dirty, so maybe just stop being so judge? You have now lied to her, given her a complex, and made her waste money on perfumes because she believes that she smells all because you decided what her shower routine should be?", "\"I've never noticed that she smelled or that her hair was greasy or anything like that in the time I've known her.\" So what the hell is your problem? She obviously has good personal hygiene, it just differs from yours.  \nYTA.", "YTA. She might be washing up but just not in the shower. But now you've made her feel bad. Break up with her so she can find a nicer guy.", "Yes, YTA. Not everyone needs to shower as frequently as you do, as it depends on lifestyle, genetics, and a bunch of other stuff. You flatout lied and manipulated her because you just like to do things differently. you are not only the asshole, but you are breakup material.", "YTA", "While I can see some concern because who doesn't want their SO to be clean and healthy and happy. But where you are the AH is where you lied to her and used your words to manipulate her into doing what you wanted. There was no need for lying, honesty is important in all relationships no matter how big or small. The fact you can confirm you have never smelled any type of smell from you girlfriend and then willingly lie to her saying she smells is manipulative. You're putting her down for something that isn't true. Here's where I'll sound like a broken record, JUST BE HONEST WITH HER.", "YTA. You lied to her about something that would obviously make her feel bad. Why couldn\u2019t you just be adult about it and have an honest conversation?", "YTA for the lying, but not necessarily for your feelings on the matter of the frequency of her showers. While it is her choice whether she showers often or not, you are allowed to feel iffy about it. Hygi\u00ebne phobias are remarkably common and aren't always rational. Obviously you realise she doesn't need to shower as often, but you can't get over the fact she doesn't shower often. For that, maybe therapy can help to give you the means to give other people's hygiene habits a place in your emotional thinking.\n\nTldr, go apologise and discuss this properly, when you're rested.", "Have you talked to her about why she doesn't shower? Does she have any sort of skin conditions or dry skin that would make it worse? If she doesn't smell she's obviously cleaning up, especially her essential areas. YTA for lying to her to get her to do what you want her to do.", "You really have to ask? Yes, YTA for lying to your GF and manipulating her to meet up to your standards.

That is something she may take with herself for the rest of her life.\n\nYou could\u2019ve approached that subject with more maturity.

So now you know & now you're not just a ah but a DUMBASS.", "YTA and manipulative and a liar. Ick", "YTA. The issue here is that you lied to her.

She should have just told her gf the truth, that it bothers her for whatever reason, but no, she proceeded to make her feel bad about herself. Vile behavior. At least come clean now THAT SHE NEVER SMELLED.", "Disagree. She's not fine. She has poor hygiene. Antiperspirant doesn't work over old deodorant. I'm sure she has periods, has sex, craps.

In the hottest parts it's not unusual to have three showers a day. \nIt is a common saying here that we have inherited this habit from the indigenous population. We shower once or twice a day even when visiting very cold countries, and we are baffled by the culture of not showering exhibited by people of different nationalities.

There is also the natural oil to the skin and natural shedding of dead skin that accumulates. There is cooking and street pollution that can cause your skin and hair to smell. And no, skin, hair and smell problems are not common here due to the \"excessive\" showering.\nI'm not trying to offend anybody, no culture is better than the other, but maybe this is a cultural difference between OP and his girlfriend. \nI don't think OP should have lied to her, and I don't know where he's from, but in my culture I don't care how cold it is, showering is common courtesy.
