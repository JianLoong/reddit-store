You are right to keep your distance from him.", "NTA. I went N/C with a step parent who adopted my siblings, not me. \n\nThey aren\u2019t a very great person, but I am the one who decided no contact.

He clearly hated you so don't feel bad about the situation. He shouldn't be such an AH if he wanted help", "Actually it's not as complicated as you think. Definitely NTA. Him not wanting to be adopted is definitely OK. Him not wanting you at any of his life events, graduation and wedding are his choices. Him insisting you not be at your own home for the holidays is outrageous. He has created this isolated life for himself so now he gets to deal with it on his own. Also his kids are strangers to you and to be viewed as a step grandma that means Nick would have to view you as a stepmother and we all know that's a lie.", "NTA, he burned the bridges, he decided to leave, now in need he remembers you only as an opportunity ... ignore it.", "NTA at all!  He hasn't wanted anything to do with you and now he's telling you to step up?!  You said exactly the right thing.

He doesn't deserve your help unless he makes a massive effort to undo the years of harm he's done first.", "NTA. My guess is Nick\u2019s wife is wondering why they\u2019re not being the usual grandparents and Nick, I\u2019m guessing, has filled her head with all kinds of lies and is playing the victim. Stand strong, OP.", "Where is Nicks wife? She is not mentioned. Or did he burn that bridge too?", "NTA.  Block him honestly", "NTA, he's made his bed and he will have to lie in it. He can't just do \"backsies\" on a relationship HE destroyed just because it is convenient for him now.", "NTA. This is a very real consequence of what happens when you burn bridges.

Kudos to you for raising 5 kids that are not yours.", "NTA - homie wanna play them games up until he needed some support from you? Nah thats not how that works you can't treat somebody that cold and then ask them to step up as a grandparent. You aren't those kids grandmother anymore than he allowed you to be his mom.", "NTA. And a few things to consider.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Be aware that any relationship you do have with his children will always come with the threat of him taking the kids away from you because he hasn't changed his feelings towards you, only what he needs from you. He will have no problem with removing you from their lives again, which may be hard on both you and the children. So best not to get involved with them at all\n2. The level of BALLS it takes to berate and ignore someone your entire life and then get on the phone to tell them flat out that they are failing in their duty to the family takes some level of narcissism that I can't even fathom. People who are that bold and that insightless and manipulative are people you should always stay away from. Their approach to you might change but their feelings towards you won't.\n3. Your husband needs to have an opinion on this. The fact that he's like \"whatever, up to you\" is pretty shocking considering the way you've been treated over the years.

How odd.", "Didn\u2019t invite you to the wedding, sucks but it\u2019s his wedding and his call. Understandable. But Wanted you to leave a party that YOU were hosting?

He wanted no contact with all that entails, now he has to live in the mess he created. If you had said yes, I don't see it going well.

You reap what you so. He only wants something from you. He\u2019s not interested in building a relationship with you or repairing fences.

He is only reaching out because he needs someone to use.  What would happen with your relationship with those grandkids when he decides he doesn't need a babysitter any more.  Are you expected to ignore and lose that relationship?  He doesn't sound like someone trying to rebuild a connection, just use one.", "NTA at all. But if you want a relationship with him and his kids at all you gotta start somewhere. Hard for some people just to apologize sometimes.

Not even to make someone respect you. (Though I'd say the blame for him not showing you respect is probably to be put at his dads feet - he seems to bot have drawn a line when he should have.) \nNick continued his disrespect well into adulthood. Veing deliberately mean and spitefull. And he can face the consequences of his actions towards you.\nYou might have worded it differently, but you are right and NTA. He burned all bridges with you.

I have a similar thing going on with my younger brother- my dad died, and my mom developed Alzheimer\u2019s around the same time, which meant her four kids had to step up and take care of her- \n\nExcept, he didn\u2019t. Told us he couldn\u2019t afford to help with expenses, and was too busy to ever help with spending time with her to give the rest of us a break. After telling us that, he proceeded to buy a weekend property, a camper for that property, ATV\u2019s, dirt bikes, a shed for those, etc- and was posting on FB every single weekend when he was up there. I personally tried talking to him four times, explaining how this was affecting me, my other brother, and sister- still insisted he was too broke and too busy.\n\nThe funny thing is, his wife, who completely has his back, is constantly playing the victim on FB, posting passive aggressive shit about how family should come first.

I was the final person who bowed out. I felt insanely guilty because \"now he doesn't have anyone\". Well, that was by his own doing. It has a lot to do with his mental illness, but how can I just be cool with him now when those same eyes looking back at me have put me through absolute hell? Why do I have to just sit back and take abuse because he's SMI? I don't, and neither do you.

Hell, I've seen threads like this where there were commenter's saying the same.\n\nThe fact is that you, like so many before you, have realized that forever pining and hoping leaves you vulnerable to each rejection. It isn't healthy, and it isn't realistic.\n\nEven now, even if you indulged your Step-son I'd place high odds he wouldn't \"really\" appreciate you.

You ain't his nanny and he can go cry about it.", "NTA, you're right. He burned that village down. He has treated you like that and then got mad when he reaped what he had sown.

He's possibly had situations where they were able to do fun things while their kids were spending weekends with grandma and he wasn't able to. So frustration with missing out was enough of an impetus to call up someone he neither likes nor respects in an attempt to get the benefits of a relationship that never had any value until now.", "Imo, NTA\n\nFrom what you are saying, it seems he either wants a free babysitter, which in this case, it's just him taking advantage of the \"family\" factor that he has already destroyed over the past few years \n\nOr he wants, in an extremely weird way, to let you have a relationship with your grandchildren, even if he doesn't like you. I doubt it is this, but I've seen it happen \n\nIn either case, the fact that he trusts you enough to be with his children shows that the problem when being raised was never you. He is the problem", "I dont think what you said was wrong at all. If you wanted to try to mend bridges, you could suggest he apologise to everyone and spend time with the kids amongst the family, rather than just dumping them on someone, who to them, is an absolute stranger by the sounds of it.

HOWEVER, that does not give him cart blanche to walk all over everyone in his life. As a child, he didn't know better. As an adult, he's *choosing* not to know better, and that's not your responsibility no matter how much he was hurting as a kid. We don't choose to have poor mental health, but we can (almost always) choose to deal with it in a healthy way or- at minimum- in a way that doesn't hurt others. \n\nI hope you did what you could for him as a child.

My step siblings don\u2019t really spend any time with my dad on their own, while I do spent time solo with my stepmom. But all of their children absolutely consider my dad to be one of their grandfathers, because my parents have been together for like twenty five years and they\u2019re all 1-12. Additionally, my grandmother\u2019s second husband is not really my dad\u2019s stepfather because he was already out of the house and raising his own family, but her husband is definitely one of my grandparents because I\u2019ve known him since I was like 8.\n\nWhatever\u2019s going on here (barely in touch with biological father, demanding that stepmother vacate the premises entirely during her own events, yet somehow still believing that they have an obligation to help with \u201cgrandchildren\u201d) is WILD and not the same thing.", "OP\u2019s husband has just let this kid dump on his stepmom, but his hunting cabin being disrespected was his line?
