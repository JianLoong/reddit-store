However you have no obligation to continue letting her use your internet for free. As someone already mentioned she may not even realize she\u2019s still using it as most phones these days auto connect to the best signal they have access too. Block her off of it and if she asks why say you reset it and didn\u2019t realize she still needed to use it.", "NTA\n\nYou could change the password and when she comes round just explain that it\u2019s your monthly security check and she should have a new cycle of data by now\n\nOr if you feel nice you could let her still use it because it doesn\u2019t cost you any extra for her to use it\n\nBut whichever way you go, NTA", "NTA. I'd just change the password or something. \n\nBut, if you want to have a friendship with her you might want to plan ahead what you'll say if she asks for the new password. If it doesn't negatively impact your own internet speed, and you want to be friends with her, I'd give her the new password. But chances are, she won't ask for the new password anyway.", "NTA\n\nYou did a nice neighbourly thing, gave her the phone charger and let her use the WiFi, that doesn't mean it's now turned into some sort of long running arrangement. Change the password/block her and there isn't even really any need to say anything if you only gave her access this weekend gone.", "NTA. Turn it off and don\u2019t let her mooch anymore", "NTA, if she wants internet she should pay for it, same as you do.", "The default for a lot of devices is that you punch in the wifi password and it remembers it. So your neighbour's phone may just be going to wifi when in range.\n\nYou have some options. You could speak to her\nThat you have a device number cap and data overage after allotment and ask she have rhe phone forget the connection. Failing that you can just change password, block. \n\nOr you can just change, block, without telling.she got along without your connection before. If confronted, tell the truth...or don't and pretend you don't know what is wrong. \n\nI'd just change it without telling.", "NTA it's your wifi you pay for it. If she wants to continue using it she can ask you.", "NTA, if she still needs it I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come ask, you can make a judgement from there. Not your responsibility.\n\nDepending on your internet plan, can be expensive to just have anyone and everyone using it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA \nI would change the password and if asked just tell her that it was recommended that you change it regularly for your security.", "NTA my neighbour did this asked to borrow WiFi for one day ended up being weeks and weeks they must of had absolutely everything in their house hooked up to my WiFi because my own Internet connection wouldn't stream, daughter couldn't do homework etc I went on and looked at what was being used I was livid changed password straight away and the nerve of this woman to come to my door and say her son couldn't play xbox because I had obviously changed the password. Told her to do one.", "NTA\n\nI live out in the country. We only had 1 neighbor close by and honestly, I didn't even think they had Computer or anything so I never put a password on my wifi. Bad bad bad move. Turns out they got a laptop and connected it to my wifi and started to download movies. Like new movies that were pirated from theaters. So one day I get a letter from my isp saying that I was caught downloading pirated movies and if I get another strike against me not only would I lose my internet but I could be sued for downloading these movies. I was mortified. Well lesson learned. I put the hardest password you could imagine on my internet. My neighbors teenage daughter and son both came over and asked what happened to the internet. I ripped them both a new one. Then their dad came over to discuss my behavior towards his children. I proceeded to rip him a new one before telling him to get the f off my property. \n\nI don't know about now but you can absolutely geri in trouble for what they are doing using your internet.\n\n*Edited for typos*", "Her phone will have remembered the settings. Good chance she does not even realise.", "NTA", "NTA but I would let her know", "INFO: Is there some reason you don't want to let her know that (a) you know and (b) you're putting a stop to it?", "NTA.", "NTA, but be prepared for a rage visit.", "NTA but she may not even realize it\u2019s happening, or maybe her phone hops on your network when it\u2019s stronger. My neighbor and I are close friends so we do this all the time. Since you\u2019re not close friends, you may want to just give her a heads up. I\u2019m the type to think the best of people and while other comments are like \u201cshe can pay for it like everyone else\u201d- she\u2019s young and obviously went through a tough spot- she\u2019s not some super villain. Just let her know you gotta change it soon. If you want to give her the new one, that\u2019s fine too- it\u2019s yours to share or not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's different for every router so just Google yours.
