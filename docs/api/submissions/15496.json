It's going well, he is very sweet. We're both in for the long-term.\n\nHe is a smoker. Doesn't smoke that much, 5-6 cigarettes a day, but has been smoking since he's a teenager.\n\nI don't smoke, ever. Never have. None of my friends / family / exes do. I'm really not a fan of the smell, or even just that he smokes. It's obvious that I don't like it.\n\nWe talked about it, and I told him that I didn't like him smoking but that was his choice, so I wouldn't nag him to quit nor do an ultimatum or stuff like that.\n\nOnce he was telling me about his parents, how they always are very supportive, and he told me that three or four times a year, he tells them he's stopping smoking, they are both very happy and congratulate him a lot, and he does stop smoking, ... but after a few days he just starts again. I was not laughing, and told him that I would personally not appreciate it, but he laughed it off.\n\nA month later, he had a big smile, and told me that he had decided to stop smoking, for me, because he could see I was not happy about it and he wanted to make me happy. I hesitated, told him that I was not asking him to do so, he didn't have to, it was his choice; but I was not like his parents, so if he told me he was quitting smoking for me, I would expect him to actually do it, not start again after a few days, was he really sure about it?\n\nHe told me that he was quitting for real, so I was very happy and thanked him.\n\nYou guessed it: he started smoking again a few days later.\n\nI was really mad. He told me that he tried but the habit is just really strong so I shouldn't nag him, and basically I should just be happy that he at least tried.\n\nI think his actions make him a liar who would tell me stuff that he doesn't mean to make me happy on the short-term, but he won't follow through. So I cannot trust him when he says he is going to do or not do something, and I should reconsider the relationship.\n\nHe thinks I can't tell him what to do, that it's his choice, and I would be an AH to do an ultimatum.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?  \n\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention: we live in a country where there are many \"helps\" to stop smoking (for free). When he told me he had started again, I offered we look into those \"helps\" - he never used them in his previous tries to stop, so they may work. He immediately dismissed it, saying I was nagging, that was his business only, and I should not meddle.

He shouldn't have said he was stopping for you as its something you have to do for yourself. \n\nI do think you should reconsider the relationship though because it's evident you don't like smoking and he's not ready to give it up. I am also not sure you wouldn't hold resentment against him for smoking. I am also unsure if he will be successful in his attempt to stop smoking while feeling under pressure to do so. \n\nDon't give him an ultimatum.

Using him failing to quit as an excuse not to trust him is a bit far fetched.", "If you can\u2019t handle the fact he may smoke on and off for the rest of his life then just dump him now. He may quit and quit forever. Or he could smoke occasionally, or smoke a lot. It\u2019s hard to know. But it\u2019s 4 months in and if this is already and issue it sounds like any smoking at all would be a problem. Just dump him now and save both of you the trouble", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't make him an ultimatum. He made you a promise, and immediately broke it. And you didn't tell him he had to quit, you told him that breaking promises was a dealbreaker. \n\nI'm going to be blunt here. Quitting smoking is hard, but there is no way someone who consistently promises to quit and then starts smoking again within a few days didn't have *some* inkling that he would probably fail this time too. He made that promise to you anyway. And IMO, he didn't do this to \"make you happy\", he did this to lower your expectations of him, to whittle away at the bar you set until it is low enough to suit him. Much like he's done with his parents - they praise him any time he promises to quit, even though he fails almost immediately. He wanted the same reliable praise from you, and now he's blaming you for not giving it to him. That's a massive red flag. \n\nAnd, as a side note, 5-6 cigs a day does not qualify as someone who \"doesn't smoke that much\".", "NTA. You didn't issue an ultimatum. You clearly told him that it is his decision, but if he does decide to quit, you will hold him to that.\n\nHe \"quit\" for at best a few days before giving up. He did not go to the doctor about what help was available. He didn't even go and get a box of patches to help wean himself off.\n\nI think you're right. He's a liar. This is not a one-off thing. He's done this multiple times with his patents already. It's very obvious from his actions that he is not serious about quitting. He just wants people to think he is.\n\nAddiction is difficult, but he's not trying. He wants the praise of making the first step but gives up as soon as it starts to become more difficult.\n\nYou do you OP. But I wouldn't want a relationship with someone who behaved like your partner does.", "It doesn't sound like he's really put in the effort to stop smoking if he hasn't tried the methods that truly work for other people.

You haven't. It is physically miserable and emotionally/mentally draining.  It's been 11 years since my last cigarette and I still have cravings.  He will do it when he's ready and not a minute before.  If this is a deal breaker for you then end the relationship. But most people try to quit several times before it sticks.", "It's a 4 months relationship and you are already getting in his case about something he's been doing way before you showed up in his life that you knew you dislike and still proceeded with the relationship?

I wish you the best. Bye\"", "It seems like him smoking might be a deal breaker and that\u2019s fair enough. Soft YTA for calling him a liar, addiction doesn\u2019t work like that.

This is not about lying or trust. Addiction is real, and hard to break.  \n\nYTA for being so ignorant about the genuine physiological and psychological effects and difficulties of addiction.

Instead of accusing him of lying (he's not btw), why not discuss supporting him. Maybe he'd be willing to try vaping first?", "I've read that it takes 10 times quitting and failing before finally quitting for good.  I'd view it as a good try and keep encouraging him.

He told me that he tried but the habit is just really strong so I shouldn't nag him, and basically I should just be happy that he at least tried.\n\n**Huge** YTA - Smokers manage to quit when they stop measuring failures and start measuring how much sucess they have had instead.

It\u2019s a very new relationship and you\u2019re already trying to change him while claiming you\u2019re not? That\u2019s a red flag. If you knew going into this that you didn\u2019t like that he smoked why did you keep dating? \nI\u2019m sure he did have the intention to quit but it\u2019s hard, especially when you\u2019ve been smoking for, I\u2019m assuming, at least 15 years. It doesn\u2019t make him a liar if he tried but failed. It means he wasn\u2019t successful. Also smoking is like any other addiction, it can come back any time. My mom quit smoking for YEARS and then started again. I started smoking as a teenager and have quit many times only to come back to it months or over a year later. It\u2019s not an easy thing to just stop.", "I am not sugarcoating this with a \"Soft\" YTA. It is a hard YTA. You lost trust in this man because he is addicted to one of the most addictive substances on the planet? And he tried to quit for you but his withdrawls and stress caused him to try again. You have zero empathy for this man. These people commenting NTA are absolutely uneducated but the ones saying reconsider the relationship are right. He doesn't need a nagging, uncompassionate broad at his side. End it for the both of you.", "A mild YTA. He's a smoker. It's disgusting. but you knew that when you started seeing him. Either accept the fact he's an addict, or move on to a non-smoker.", "YTA. If you don't wanna date a smoker then leave him.", "ESH\n\nLeave him now if you don't want to be with a smoker. I have had many friends over the years who dated smokers or were the smokers in a relationship. Promises to quit rarely stuck and it ruined relationships as the smoker didn't want to change and the nonsmoker thought that \"if the smoker really loved me\" they would quit. \n\nAccept it or move on.", "Meh\u2026 this sounds to me like he wants to quit but needs to feel like there\u2019s an external reason so he says he\u2019s doing it for mom/dad/you hoping it\u2019ll stick. You told him you didn\u2019t want to be roped into that approach so it sucks that he did it anyway, but if you really would prefer he not smoke, just be as supportive as you can and (privately) anticipate that it will take some failure along the way\u2026\n\nSoft YTA. If you\u2019re going to consider someone a liar anytime they try to do something they say they will but fail to complete it, relationships are going to be very challenging.", "YTA.\n\n Yes, he is a grown man who should not be declaring he is going to quit just to get patted on the head by mom and dad, only to start up again. \n\nHowever, obviously you have never struggled with addiction. It is not easy to break an addictive cycle, it is incredibly difficult. Further, you had empirical evidence of how he has tried several times but has always failed, so, what made you think this time would be different? He basically just followed the same pattern he has been. He may really want to quit but cannot. Again, to me it is obvious that you have very little knowledge of how insidious addictions truly are. Classic addict pattern, to say you are going to quit but ultimately, start right back up again. \n\nYou could make an ultimatum but, likely the end of the relationship. Putting pressure on someone to stop an addiction makes it worse. Further, he smoked when you met him. Either you are OK with that, or you are not. He may quit some day, he may not. That will be up to him to decide. Unfortunately, addiction is such that at the moment, it really truly feels like this time, you are going to quit. And then, it overwhelms you. Labeling him a straight up liar is unfair and misses the heart of the issue.", "YTA for complaining instead of helping him quit.\n\nEveryone quits \"for real\" then fails, many times, before succeeding, so it's not surprising.\n\nIf he manages to quit he'll be an asshole while on withdrawal, it lasts about 2 weeks. I mean I'm normally an asshole but when I quit smoking it was absolutely spectacular. If you want to help him on his quest, don't be annoying while he's on withdrawal.\n\nAnother option is to get him a vape, but make sure the liquid is not flavored and does not reek. If it tastes good, it's not going to help against the habit lol.", "YTA, unless his other behavior gives you a reason to doubt that he was being truthful, then you shouldn't jump to the conclusion that he was just lying. Unfortunately smoking is a habit that is hard to quit as it is both a physiological and a behavioral addiction. Perhaps try discussing options that can help him quit together, if he really does want to quit for you? And maybe look within to see why this triggered something in you to distrust him even when at first you were OK with him not quitting since you felt it was his own choice. You might be projecting something personal onto this situation.", "ESH.\n\nYou for getting into a relationship with a smoker knowing you don't like people who smoke. Also for unrealistic expectations around his quitting - it's as simple as just stopping, but it's not easy at all. I think the quoted statistic is that it takes an average of seven attempts to actually cease. I know from my own experience it took more. \n\nHim because he keeps jerking everyone around to get the kudos for quitting without actually doing it. Yes, he's an addict. Yes, he doesn't \"mean\" to lie and it's harder than just saying you're going to stop. But this isn't something where he's quit for months and then there's a slip up. He needs to be honest with himself and everyone else that he's not ready to quit yet. And when he *is* ready he should try doing it without announcing it so he doesn't continue this quit > praise > immediate relapse cycle.", "Idk, I think some people are being a bit harsh. You shouldn't be so full force on the whole liar thing, smoking is addictive and quitting wouldn't be easy at all. Especially if he wouldn't be using the services that will help him to quit. Doing it on his own would be so tough. I don't think it means he would have no follow through on other things, unless he has a running history of doing it about other things also. \n\nThat said, it doesn't look like you asked him to stop prior to him making that decision. He wanted to do it FOR YOU (though, he should only do it for himself, really) but you never asked him to. You essentially said you wouldn't appreciate it if he said he would quit only to keep smoking. Which again, difficult to do, he's got an addiction. \n\nI think you should just talk to him. Tell him you appreciate him trying and if he decides to quit in the future, you'd like to support him, which can include outside help. He doesn't have to quit on his own. Then I suggest letting it go. I get being upset over it though (I went through something similar when my smoker boyfriend said he would quit smoking when I got pregnant, but I just let it go. Ultimately it is his choice, as long as he didn't do it around me or our son). \n\nI'd say NTA. I think you both handled this poorly, but I don't think you're assholes. He has a smoking addiction that you wouldn't 100% understand as a non-smoker.", "\nYou're old enough to know you're being controlling. You don't like smokers? Then you don't date one, but expecting change and looking down on him is pointless. He only pretends he's gunna stop because everyone dislikes it, and he knows, but he clearly doesn't wanna stop so he isn't going to. If you're going to continue this relationship then accept every part of him because you can't change him. He will quit if he decides to. Not because of anyone else hounding him. Y'all should stop talking about cigs altogether or breakup.  He's a smoker and you knew that so if you can't handle it you know where the door is. It's simple, y'all are incompatible.

As well as you are being \n\n>I think his actions make him a liar who would tell me stuff that he doesn't mean to make me happy on the short-term, but he won't follow through. So I cannot trust him when he says he is going to do or not do something, and I should reconsider the relationship\n\n You lack empathy in this situation. Quitting is hard. I watched my dad \"quit\" over 30 times and he'd last a week or two. He officially quit smoking 17 years ago and he still have moments were he gets a wicked craving. Nicotine is the main addictive drug in tobacco that makes quitting so hard. Cigarettes are designed to rapidly deliver nicotine to your brain.\nInside your brain, nicotine triggers the release of chemicals that make you feel good. As nicotine stimulates parts of your brain over and over, your brain gets used to having nicotine around. Over time, nicotine changes how your brain works and makes it seem like you need nicotine just to feel okay.\nWhen you stop smoking, your brain gets irritable. As a result, you might get anxious or upset. You might have a hard time concentrating or sleeping, have strong urges to smoke, or just feel generally uncomfortable. I get that you don't like it, but giving him this ultimatum isn't helpful. Instead support him, help him set goals to help him quit. Addictions are messy and hard to break free of. And personally I feel ultimatums are pointless, what are you hoping to achieve? You can sit him down and tell him you appreciate the effort a week or two may not.seem bad to you but to him it's hell. Imagine having an itch that you can't scratch no matter how hard you try and it can get more intense when your having a rough day at work.

However, since he has been smoking for so long, he doesn't want to just go cold turkey. \n\nInstead of belittling him and trying to make him feel bad, why don't you instead try and encourage him to give up by giving him options like \"I know you struggle to stop smoking so why don't you try a vape and see how you get on with it to begin with or we can try and get you on some Nicotine Patches or Gum?\"", "Listen, I myself have quit some pretty hard addictions, (Benzos and meth, and weed a few times) but Nicotine is just something I have not been able to successfully quit, and I doubt I ever will. \n\nIf you don't like smokers, you should not have begun dating a smoker.", "NTA - he is a liar. You didn't give him an ultimatum. You held him to his promise.

It's going well, he is very sweet. We're both in for the long-term.\n\nHe is a smoker. Doesn't smoke that much, 5-6 cigarettes a day, but has been smoking since he's a teenager.\n\nI don't smoke, ever. Never have. None of my friends / family / exes do. I'm really not a fan of the smell, or even just that he smokes. It's obvious that I don't like it.\n\nWe talked about it, and I told him that I didn't like him smoking but that was his choice, so I wouldn't nag him to quit nor do an ultimatum or stuff like that.\n\nOnce he was telling me about his parents, how they always are very supportive, and he told me that three or four times a year, he tells them he's stopping smoking, they are both very happy and congratulate him a lot, and he does stop smoking, ... but after a few days he just starts again. I was not laughing, and told him that I would personally not appreciate it, but he laughed it off.\n\nA month later, he had a big smile, and told me that he had decided to stop smoking, for me, because he could see I was not happy about it and he wanted to make me happy. I hesitated, told him that I was not asking him to do so, he didn't have to, it was his choice; but I was not like his parents, so if he told me he was quitting smoking for me, I would expect him to actually do it, not start again after a few days, was he really sure about it?\n\nHe told me that he was quitting for real, so I was very happy and thanked him.\n\nYou guessed it: he started smoking again a few days later.\n\nI was really mad. He told me that he tried but the habit is just really strong so I shouldn't nag him, and basically I should just be happy that he at least tried.\n\nI think his actions make him a liar who would tell me stuff that he doesn't mean to make me happy on the short-term, but he won't follow through. So I cannot trust him when he says he is going to do or not do something, and I should reconsider the relationship.\n\nHe thinks I can't tell him what to do, that it's his choice, and I would be an AH to do an ultimatum.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Before then I knew it was paying money to poison yourself.  Even at first it just made me feel sick but somehow I went back for more.\n\nOver the years I've quit a couple times. Currently smoking, let me tell you, if you don't know its so hard. Its not just like a choice you make, because when you do it you get put into very difficult situations.\n\nWe are all expected to be friendly enough to people we interact with, but quitting can even make you bitchy with your partner over nothing. So then you take that into your job and interacting with others, same thing.\n\nIt also interacts with other things in life. Other personality traits etc. So essentially quitting is hardest, for me, because it puts me in a situation where I am literally going to turn into a big dick for 3 days to a week or two. I can't help it. Especially when its been a part of my work day for years. Start work smoke. Break time. Smoke. I found taking out those smoke sessions really helped me last time.\n\nAnywahs. It sucks. And during the first 24-48 hours you can practically find yourself just enraged for no good reason.\n\nThat said smoking is worse for us than many believe. It impairs brain function. Muscles. Everything. Causes cancer. Collapses lungs. Kills people.\n\nOk I think I'm ready to try quitting now. \n\nLet's give it a go.", "So your gonna have issues if you decide to have a baby etc.", "That\u2019s the thing about quitting anything, and by and large we all have something we can quit.

YOU have to want it.", "ESH, you for dating someone who does something you don't like, people usually won't change, not like that, and he for thinking it's funny to say he'll do something and then not do it, maybe he does so in other areas, I don't know.", "If you don\u2019t like smoking why would you date him in the first place??", "I\u2019ll go with NAH. Quitting smoking is HARD, you can be all decisive and do well for 5 days and suddenly the urge gets so incredibly strong you start pacing around ur room at 3am and all you can think about is having a smoke. Once\nYou decide to give in you\u2019ve already made the decision to give up this time and there\u2019s rarely a turning back, you\u2018ll feel like shit for giving in, much more if you\u2018ve told people you\u2018re stopping, you already feel like a failure, so ofc the last thing you want to hear is other\u2019s telling you the same. \nSo I don\u2019t think you should call him a liar and stop trusting him over this, just make it clear that this was a one time thing, and if he decides he wants to quit some day he better do it for himself and be sure not to make any promises he might not be able to keep. \n\nYou never asked him to quit and you told him that you would not be like his parents, so I don\u2019t think you\u2018re the asshole for being hurt, upset or disappointed. He also isn\u2019t the asshole quite yet, as long as he learns from this and doesn\u2019t make promises like this in the future.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t ask him to quit but he\u2019s \u2019doing it for you\u2019. This can be problematic- as when he fails, you feel less important than cigs.

Even though he's dealing with the related health issues I warned him about, I didn't tell him I told you so. I helped him and supported him.\nThe difference between your and my situation is that he's my brother so I've known him all my life, you're in a few months old relationship. This isn't just about you not wanting to date a smoker. You started dating him when you knew he smoked. Then you told him you won't push or nag. When he tried on quitting, but couldn't completely and went back to smoking. You didn't even attempt to support him. You are terming him as a liar. Look at this point you need to decide if you can be in a relationship with someone who is basically dealing with an addiction. You know what doesn't work though?

It took 6 months of absolute grim determination, I was angry and miserable the whole time, and I gained 30 lbs because I ate everything in sight. It seems to me your boyfriend is barely making an attempt and just giving up. If you want to make the relationship easier, just assume he's never going to quit smoking. If he actually quits, great! If not, then you have a decision to make as to whether to stay with a smoker or to find someone else. I know only a handful of people who have actually ever quit, so I'd really lower my expectations in this situation.", "YTA, you started a relationship with a smoker.

Regardless, I still tell him I'm proud of how far he's come.\n\nESH but only because he has refused alternatives that help people quit. You are definitely an AH tho for being with a smoker when you hate the habit AND for shaming him. He's not a liar, he's just not strong enough alone to quit cold turkey and his ego is stopping him from accepting help.\n\nWith only 4 months together, you may want to think about how much longer you're willing to be unsupportive and stay with someone who's habit you hate.", "Soft YTA.

All strategies which have been shown to significantly improve the odds of successfully reducing tobacco dependence, as laid out by the [NIH]( https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/tobacco-nicotine-e-cigarettes/what-are-treatments-tobacco-dependence)\n\nWhat does not work is promising loved ones to quit for their benefit every few months, regularly relapsing  within a few days, and laughing about it afterwards while refusing to change anything or seek any outside help, even when it is easily accessible and freely offered.

Addiction is absolutely, painfully, frustratingly real, on both a mental and biological level, and extremely difficult to combat. But that doesn't make it okay to make promises you know you can't keep to loved ones, and then get angry at them when they are understandably upset after you break them. It is possible to understand why people do things and sympathize with their struggles, without condoning their actions. People can do bad things for reasons they don't fully control, but **they are still responsible for having done those things**.

How hard can it be to not do something that, in my case, required me to decide to smoke again, get dressed, take my key, getting in my car, drive to the shop, buy a pack, come back home and smoke. That's a lot of steps, a lot of chances for me to stop myself. And every time I relapsed I felt like a failure. How weak of a will must I have to not being able to stop myself. Again, it took me more than a year and many failed attempts. \nAnd I'm not saying he feels that way either, again, I don't know him. \nYou on the other hand would like to see commitment.

I was getting cravings years after I quit nicotine. For the weirdest things, hard day it pops into your head. Having coffee in the morning always though of cigs. Driving was a hard one for me to get used to as well. Smoking becomes so ingrained into your habits that seemingly unrelated things trigger the craving. It just becomes more manageable the longer you go where instead of a head on craving it\u2019s just huh a cig sounds good right now. It\u2019s a hell of an addiction to quit and we all know how bad it was for us. Sometimes it\u2019s just life is hard enough on it\u2019s own and it\u2019s hard to add things on top of that.

That's the nature of addiction.\n\nSo, OP, if you continue in this relationship, do so with eyes wide open.  He has insufficient control over his addiction to make promises about it, but he has to make those promises anyway if he is ever going to quit.  If you can't square yourself with that, then you should really just end it -- you'll find yourself much happier that way (and I wouldn't blame you one bit; relationships with addicts are hard).  If you stay, it's probably going to work best if you hold off on offering quitting advice until he says he's ready to try again.\n\n(I was a smoker for about 13 years, and a vaper for another 2 before I quit.

In that emotional state, I did not/could not receive advice that folks tried to give me.\n\nThe best time to offer actionable advice and resources is in the lead-up to a quit attempt.  Not in the aftermath.\n\nI think OP is NTA.

I've felt the addiction feelings, and I'm projecting those feelings onto BF.  Second, this post was made by someone angry at BF, and so likely has a negative bias about him.)", "But he already joked before about making promises he can't keep to his parents.

No successful attempt at quitting smoking has ever started with \"I'm going to try to quit smoking and we'll see how it goes\".\n\nBF might well accept free help.  Just not right now.  When I used to fail at quitting smoking, I always felt embarrassed, dejected, and defeated for some period of time.

Which are the inhaled and deposited in the lungs as \"tar.\"\n\nVaping contains a few chemicals, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, nicotine, and food safe flavorings(of which there are many different chemicals involved but most have been thoroughly tested for ingestion(granted they haven't been extensively tested for inhalation, and the ones we know are bad for inhalation are generally avoided by manufacturers, such as diacetyl). None of these chemicals undergo a combustion reaction as in smoking, they are merely heated up and vaporized so they don't actually change chemical form. Generally speaking, we know most of what you inhale when you vaporize e-juice.\n\nThe differences in the amount of toxic chemicals inhaled is VASTLY different between the two substances. Vaping has been around long enough that the adverse effects should have begun appearing already of which there aren't many/if any being recorded.  Increased susceptibility to pneumonia and an increase in heart disease(nicotine is a vasoconstrictor) are probably the most dangerous side effects of vaping we know of so far. \n\nIt is, so far as we know, vastly safer than smoking. \n\nAnecdotally, in my experience the difference is night and day.  I went from being a 3 pack-a-day smoker who couldn't walk 50ft without getting completely winded to being able to outright run full sprint without getting anything more than out of breath for a minute or two.  My smokers cough, disappeared within a week. I wake up in the mornings and don't have to hack up half a lung just to be able to breathe. \n\nI feel 100x better, the nicotine still gives me a headrush, but other than that I don't feel groggy or cloudy-headed like I did when I was ingesting God only knows how many toxic chemicals from cigarettes.\n\nALL THAT BEING SAID.... I DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES RECOMMEND STARTING TO VAPE UNLESS YOU ARE A SMOKER WHO WANTS TO STOP SMOKING. Nicotine addiction SUCKS, I wish I never started and I am currently in the process of weening myself off of nicotine entirely.

Your bf will probably feel ashamed and the last thing he'll want is you nagging him.", "In this situation, OP did not give an ultimatum.

Smoking is clearly not a deal breaker for OP. \n\nHowever, the issue here is OP's bf made a unrequested promise to do something that he knows he has failed before and is unlikely to succeed this time. Making a promise is a choice and breaking one ***will, without doubt,*** degrade someone's trust.

Every single attempt I made to quit before I actually succeeded went very much like this.  I could make it 2-3 days, and then I'd cave.\n\nFrom my perspective, this looks like BF is making genuine attempts, can't get through the withdrawals, and caves.  Trying 3 times per year is quite good, actually.

Idk, I can definitely see why she's so frustrated. Especially since he's been saying the same thing to his parents time and time again so breaking that promise to her when she even encouraged him to not do that makes it pretty shitty.", "The problem is clear that he isn't trying enough though. There is a pattern that he already acknowledged with her that he does to his parents. \"I'm quit smoking\" to hearing the \"congrats we are so proud of you keep going\" and then falling back into bad habits. He is doing this for attention at this point. OP doesn't like that he smokes but nowhere are they forcing him to quit for their own comfort or preference. He went and said \"honey I'm quiting for you this time\" and OP reassured him that it wasn't necessary to their relationship that he quit just that he remained honest about his quitting. I'm sorry but following a pattern doesn't constitute as \"I'm trying\" at this point. Especially because OP offered to get them real help with this problem. Yes it's true quitting so very hard and addiction is a hard battle but you won't get anywhere without putting in the hard work. It is easier to apply that hard work and effort when you have someone supporting you through your hardest days.

It took a long time (she tried going cold turkey several times too) but we eventually got her usage down until she was ready to let it go all together. OP is only expecting he tries to uphold his promise. I'm sure they don't expect immediate results but again I restate how more effort needs to be applied in the sense of getting help instead of just falling into old patterns and getting dismissive because OP got upset for the eventual lie that he already admitted to committing.", "Yeah, trying to try. He\u2019s lame for not trying beyond saying the words. Why promise if you have no intention to actually do it? I would never date a smoker, though, I don\u2019t know what she was thinking.
