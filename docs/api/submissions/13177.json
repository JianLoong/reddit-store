I know I have no say in this, and I should be proud/happy (I am), and more to the point she was doing this kind of modeling before we met. But I guess it\u2019s the idea that people see her like this and feel like they can comment about it that is making me feel weird. \n\nLast week images were posted of her in a new line of underwear/lingerie, probably the most revealing she had ever done, and I found myself dreading people seeing it.

I think if you\u2019re directing your discomfort towards the blatantly uncomfortable comments instead of her, then yeah, I think that makes sense, and maybe you need to have a talk with your friends about boundaries.

If I had a smoking hot model as a husband, I think I would kinda embrace my friend\u2019s \u201cthumbs up\u201d reactions as long as they weren\u2019t super weird about it.

Sure, she has the 'freedom' to do this but not freedom from the consequences, which is you being upset.  It is selfish of her.  I would talk to her about it and be honest about how you feel.  I anticipate being down voted into oblivion for being old fashioned and some how misogynistic, though I am a woman myself, but I'm tired of people telling others there are no boundaries and they can do whatever they want.

They can say she looks good but that's face to face , if they are Gunna txt you about it then they are doing shady stuff behind your back.

It's one of the biggest times for insecurity and biggest moments where your marriage will be tested.\n\nThe trick is to talk about it together - even with your wife. If she's anything like the woman you married, she probably knows something is bothering you and probably wants to know.\n\nThere will be more than this that bugs you, but if you learn to communicate now and how to be open and honest, your marriage has the greatest chance of success.\n\nGood luck!", "Tell her that right now.

The husband is married to Angelina Jolie, not Lara Croft and not one of us get to see what Angelina Jolie is like behind closed doors.

And to call you about your wife's pics together from a car like it can't wait a second??? That shit is weird.\n\nDon't let people get into your head with this weirdass possessive medieval bullshit.

I agree counseling and honest conversation with your wife is a good idea.", "YTA. You do not own her.", "You didn't think so...what?

It really is that simple sometimes.", "I'm not sure what you are asking.

I get it, the comment was just in the wrong place.", "Man, that's just absolutely not true.  Comprise by definition means both parties don't get everything they want.  Like it or not, in any kind of relationship, people have to give up certain things to keep the relationship going.  Even little things.

But in this situation neither the husband nor wife can control that.  What can be controlled is her quitting. And, despite the avalanche of downvotes this opinion will get me, I do not think any women should model lingerie. Why is that necessary?  Women can order things themselves and try them on to see if they work or not.  And yes the photos already online will always be there, but that doesn't necessitate her continued work in that field.", "Yes it's her body but now that she's married it's also his body.  Just as his body is now hers.  Generally people get married because they want exclusive, special rights with each other that no one else is allowed.  Thats why it hurts when people cheat on each other for example.  Now that she's married, she can no longer make decisions just thinking of how it impacts her, but now how it impacts her husband too.  And before you freak out, same rules apply to him too.", "The greatest lie told told to people today is that 'you can have it all.'  Truth is, you can't.  People have to decide what's most important and prioritize.  And it's not fair, but it's true.  So sure, she can keep doing what she's doing but it is negatively impacting her marriage.  Personally I think marriage should be the top priority for every married person.  If you don't want the responsibility, don't get married.  Families are the foundation of society. Healthy marriages and families breed healthy societies.  There is nothing more important.  And sometimes that means growing up and making difficult choices.", "That's fine.  Obviously it's your choice.  Just my two cents.  I sincerely hope you can get something worked out.", "Sorry, they are creepy", "I\u2019m a woman, so I can\u2019t really relate to the skin thing, since dudes run around in their underwear (or something as revealing as underwear) outside all the time.

You are still sacrificing time with your family for time with his. If you didn't choose your marriage over your family, you would see them more often.  Sacrifice doesn't mean all or nothing.  SOmetimes it does mean back and white though.  Like in this case.  It just depends.  It seems no on want to hear it though.
