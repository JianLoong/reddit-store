I know I have no say in this, and I should be proud/happy (I am), and more to the point she was doing this kind of modeling before we met. But I guess it\u2019s the idea that people see her like this and feel like they can comment about it that is making me feel weird. \n\nLast week images were posted of her in a new line of underwear/lingerie, probably the most revealing she had ever done, and I found myself dreading people seeing it. She and I talked about it and she was kind of laughing it off, and I thought I was past it.

I think if you\u2019re directing your discomfort towards the blatantly uncomfortable comments instead of her, then yeah, I think that makes sense, and maybe you need to have a talk with your friends about boundaries.

If I had a smoking hot model as a husband, I think I would kinda embrace my friend\u2019s \u201cthumbs up\u201d reactions as long as they weren\u2019t super weird about it.

I\u2019m gonna go with NAH, but I recommend you talk to your friends about cooling off on some of the comments or for them to find another way to express support.

Sure, she has the 'freedom' to do this but not freedom from the consequences, which is you being upset.  It is selfish of her.  I would talk to her about it and be honest about how you feel.  I anticipate being down voted into oblivion for being old fashioned and some how misogynistic, though I am a woman myself, but I'm tired of people telling others there are no boundaries and they can do whatever they want.

Is it embarrassing on some level for you? Which could be totally normal - our initial reactions can never be \u201cwrong\u201d because we are not in control of them. It is the choices we make once we have had that initial reaction that define the type of person we choose to be.", "She knows it makes me uneasy and she\u2019s good about that, we have talked about it.", "Why is she supposed to be responsible for his friends actions? He should be telling his friends that THEIR ACTIONS are the problem and tell them to knock it off. Don't put the responsibility for others actions onto the victim.", "Right? Yeah it just feels weird.", "Yep I\u2019m totally supportive of her modeling, just trying to deal.", "Very true thank you.", "Yeah it just feels like gawking. Respectful comments would be fine.", "Ha", "Yeah but in his post he is asking about his reaction to the friend so labeling him as the asshole is not the correct judgement.  It\u2019s NTA but rather than YTA.\n\nI\u2019m not questioning your logic it\u2019s the labeling of your judgement relative to the question that was asked.", "Yeah that\u2019s all true, thanks for the feedback. I guess if someone said something generic like \u201cpretty pictures, nice job\u201d it would sound weird.", "Yeah we think alike.", "Thanks for that. Probably needed that pep talk. I\u2019m proud of her.", "She does, she has pointed out that they are not creepy, but she\u2019s sensitive to how I feel. Her female friends are a lot more open with their comments of her.", "Idk if I'd say you're in your head, there are concerns with your friend's and if they will call it out now they will definitely get inappropriate. They can say she looks good but that's face to face , if they are Gunna txt you about it then they are doing shady stuff behind your back. I can almost guarantee some of them have dms on her social media and she's had to ig ore them for the sake of you and your friends. But get people drunk to and now you're looking at some trashy people.", "You have a point.  He definitely should have said something before they got married.  But things have  changed, maybe he didn't realize how it would bother him.  Regardless it shows a lack of disrespect to him, their relationship and even herself.  Marriage means something.  And this ain't it.", "That\u2019s actually a good example!", "Totally agree! I\u2019d never ask her not to do it.", "I fully agree. I\u2019d never ask her not to pose.", "She\u2019s not saying she shouldn\u2019t bc she\u2019s married, she\u2019s normalizing that it\u2019s ok to feel jealousy about it.", "No man, she gets paid to model clothing.", "Thanks, I need to think about it. I\u2019m not embarrassed at all, I actually feel some pride. But the fact that ppl in my life actuall check that instagram page feels odd.", "It does.\n\nAlso, you're pretty new to marriage (though maybe not the relationship?) and man, those first years of marriage are absolute HELL. The honeymoon part is amazing, but I slept with one eye open, always afraid my wife would wake up and be all \"man, I can do better\". It's one of the biggest times for insecurity and biggest moments where your marriage will be tested.\n\nThe trick is to talk about it together - even with your wife. If she's anything like the woman you married, she probably knows something is bothering you and probably wants to know.\n\nThere will be more than this that bugs you, but if you learn to communicate now and how to be open and honest, your marriage has the greatest chance of success.\n\nGood luck!", "Tell her that right now. Go! Hurry! \ud83d\ude0a", "It\u2019s really not as creepy as I may have made it sound.", "what shows a lack of respect? His wife doing the shoots or people making comments?", "I don't think it is.", "What do you think guys do with photos of lingerie models?", "Thanks man. Appreciate the advice, really.", "Ha! Good advice. I need a mentor for this, lol", "Yeah I don\u2019t feel like she\u2019s disrespectful? I don\u2019t get this.", "And that\u2019s how an opinion can be different class", "We all have moments of self-doubt. Sometimes it takes an impartial bystander to give us a good metaphorical slap to the head \ud83d\ude1d", "U/palephoenix111 is a \"devout christian\".  You seem to be working through your feelings pretty reasonably so far, I would not give her comments another second of thought.", "I do need that at times! You\u2019re hired, lol.", "Thank you for this! I didn\u2019t know that.", "[In case I\u2019m not available when you need](https://youtu.be/0x-fkSYDtUY)", "No problem. Could tell just by the wording she used, confirmed by scrolling her history.", "Haha!"]}
