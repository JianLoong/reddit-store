Did you actually expect your cousin to show up there on her wedding day? Obviously you\u2019re NTA for giving birth that day but I don\u2019t understand why that had to mean that the wedding was disrupted for anyone else.  The visitors could have waited for the next day.", "INFO: was the wedding date set shortly after the due date was announced or no? They could have set the date without telling anyone long before your announcement. Even perhaps booking a venue already, other commitments to the date etc\n\nThinking about it though, I'm going to say ESH. \"My attention\"? Yikes. This sounds like two spoiled brats fighting for superiority. However you're entirely correct in that you had no control over when the baby came, so you're slightly not really an AH in this birthing/wedding scenario. \n\nBut yeah aside from that it sounds like you two have a history of being assholes to each other", "NTA - What we\u2019re you meant to do, hold it in? Anyone gets in your face about it, just tell them to do one", "NTA.   Babies don't care about due dates or weddings.

Why was the wedding set to this date???", "NTA Weddings are scheduled. Births aren't, though we can estimate when it will happen. You had no control over what happened, and thus nothing to apologize for. She was the one who played with fire the way she scheduled her wedding, and has bo right to blame you for how mutual family decided to react when forced to choose whose special event they would be present for.", "Oh yeah, because you could have hold the baby inside you until it was more convenient for your cousin, maybe one more month or two wouldn't be that hard, right?! ..(I'm being completely sarcastic) \nTotally NTA.\nCongratulations on your baby btw.\nYour cousin was the one that had the opportunity to plan her wedding and decided to plan it on your due date. You had no way to plan the birth of your child. If she did it on purpose so people would pay attention to her and forget you, then she gets what she deserves.\nIf you don't liked her, then this shouldn't bother you that much, it's a way so she can stay away from you...\nLet her be mad, your response was the right one", "NTA.  If she indeed was trying to show you up by having the wedding right around your due date, karma bit her in the a$$ and now she\u2019s mad.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu can not plan when to give birth. You can plan when to have weddings.", "Nonsense", "NTA. Not one bit. She\u2019s a brat.", "NTA - That\u2019s karma for picking a wedding date so close to your due date.

To some extent everyone wants to feel all eyes on them on their wedding day and you took some the shine off that. There\u2019s likely a subconscious or conscious rivalry going on here too from both sides, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t even care. She didn\u2019t need to be rude and also needs to know that babies aren\u2019t able to politely be asked to wait inside, but you should give her time and try again given the heat of the moment probably made you both say things you\u2019d regret. Have some empathy for the fact that a ton of your family left her special day for you (when they could have met your daughter a few hours later) and how that must have felt.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
