There\u2019s likely a subconscious or conscious rivalry going on here too from both sides, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t even care.

The new grandparents after a little while maybe, but- the whole family?And they all chose the OP\u2019s \u201cevent\u201d, except for the bride?  And the OP asked her mom where her cousin was?

I mean seriously OP, why is your cousin even on your mind then, that makes me incredibly sad for your husband and baby!\n\nIf any of this even happened.  It\u2019s just too bizarre, and too convenient that she got her revenge by going into labor during the wedding.  It reads more like some sort of alien is writing a screenplay about how they think humans behave.\n\nShe went into labor at the wedding and the baby was born an hour after the wedding?  Must\u2019ve been a pretty long wedding!  or a quick labor worthy of a TV sitcom.  \u2026Or she had started having contractions earlier, and went to the wedding anyway\u2026maybe that\u2019s what her cousin wants her to apologize for?
