His new wife of 5 months and her family wasted no time monetizing this loss, and created a GiveSendGo  account and solicited funds on social media the day he passed, with a picture of my two minor children attached.  I asked that my children's photos be removed from this \"campaign,\" as I felt this was inappropriate and also seemed exploitative because they were not receiving any of the funds from the campaign.  She refused and responded by posting more pictures of my children on social media.  When she received his cremated remains, she promised my 10 year old daughter she could have some of his ashes to put in a piece of memorial jewelry.  Two months have passed and we are upset that she refuses to \"disturb his ashes\" by giving some to my daughter.  Just before the Thanksgiving holiday, I was contacted by his family and asked to sign a document on behalf of my minor children allowing her to have an estate sale of his home (they never cohabitated) the very next day.  I did not sign the document at the advice of my counsel but made it clear that I would sign on the condition that she deliver the ashes as promised and also delete the pictures of my minor children off of her social media.  She has not met those conditions, and instead, has been complaining about me to anyone that will listen.  She and her family are throwing shade my way all over social media. I am now being given the cold shoulder by my former husband's family, and was also disinvited to their Thanksgiving celebration (I ended up driving my children out of town to meet them so they could still go).  I thought my requests of ashes for the children and eliminating my children's images from her social media campaigns were very reasonable in the first place. Asking for those things before I cleared the pathway for her to have this indoor yard sale was a reasonable request.  Now there are a lot of people casting negative actions my way.

Beliefs are active choices so when people choose to believe negative things about you it's because they want them to be true. Stop bringing your kids to people who don't like you. If you don't value yourself you'll be teaching your children damaging lessons.", "Question: do you know that he probably left stuff to you and your children, and that she wants you to sign it away?", "NTAm I'm very sure the new wife didn't tell them the truth. Surely she fed them some sob-story. Can you send your former in-laws this post with your version and the comments?", "NTA.  Don't let her sell his stuff.  Until it is accounted for.  And his kids get paid.  Further.  Stop asking her to take the pictures down.  Contact the companies.  Facebook.  Instagram.  etc.  And say they are unauthorized pictures of minor children.  You want them deleted.  They will take care of it.", "I tried to get the site to take it down.

It\u2019s a garage sale. If she takes the meager proceeds from that sale it will just come out of her share of the actual estate, so who really cares?\n\nIf he didn\u2019t change his will after his marriage then it\u2019s certain his new wife isn\u2019t the executor of the will. The executor is probably whatever member of his family contacted OP about the sale. Perhaps the MIL\u2019s panic attack, family animosity, etc, is driven by the family trying to tie up the estate\u2019s loose ends to get some closure and seeing OP as an obstruction to that process. I wonder how much of this is even coming from the widow?", "I can\u2019t figure that out either, that\u2019s the problem. She has to be saying crazy stuff.
