I had  absolutely no issue with them going, I was rather touched that my sister  offered to take them, and just a little upset that my younger daughters  (F12 and F9) weren\u2019t invited, but I just thought that was down to their  age and I\u2019m not expecting my sister to take on three of my kids while  juggling three of her own, even for just a week.\n\nA  few days ago, I was chatting with a mutual friend of mine and my  sisters, and she mentioned something about how kind it was of B to look  after my sisters kids while on vacation. I was taken aback as this was  the first I\u2019d heard of it.\n\nI  called my sister and asked if maybe B had offered to keep an eye on  them. She told me no, B hadn\u2019t offered, and she hadn\u2019t asked them to,  but she was sure B wouldn\u2019t mind babysitting while her and her husband  enjoyed themselves.\n\nI didn\u2019t take  this well, and my sister said B can always say no and they\u2019d understand,  but here\u2019s the thing, B is autistic. They are very susceptible to  manipulation, and my sister knows they have a hard time saying no. I  told her that if the only reason she invited B was free childcare for  her and her husband to bar hop Benidorm, then they won\u2019t be going.\n\nI  had to break it to B that they can\u2019t go to Benidorm, and obviously they  were devastated, and my sister and her husband have been calling me all  the assholes under the sun, telling as much of the family that will  listen that I\u2019m breaking B\u2019s heart and they only wanted to take them on a  fun vacation and maybe teach them some responsibility as \u201cthey\u2019re going  to have a family of their own to take care of some day.\u201d\n\nMy  parents and husband are on my side, but my brother thinks I\u2019m being too  protective and I need to loosen the reigns and let B make the decision  for themselves. I\u2019ve explained the situation to B, and asked them if  they\u2019d be happy looking after their cousins on vacation, and B said that  they\u2019d prefer to go to have fun, and they\u2019ve decided they don\u2019t want to  go anymore, so this is, ultimately, B\u2019s decision.\n\nI  personally don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole, but now I\u2019m wondering if my  brother and sister are right and I\u2019m just wrapping B up in cotton wool,  so Reddit, AITH?", "created_utc": 1682861045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133qepn/aita_for_not_allowing_my_17yo_to_be_taken/", "score": 5079, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Trying to teach your child \"some responsibility\" is frankly an awful attempt to excuse their poor behaviour.\n\nThey know that B is autistic, has difficulty saying no and can be manipulated. Their very deliberate actions towards B are so so gross.", "Wow, NTA, what a wild manipulation game they played there. With comments like \"so we can enjoy ourselves\" and \"teach responsibility\", B was always going to be their free child care. Anyone who says y t a especially as B, with fuller information, agrees with you, is nuts.", "Absolutely NTA. You are a great parent for watching out for your child. So lucky you found out your sister's plan before they went on holiday. Imagine B's reaction when they would have found out they were the childcare, rather than a guest, for the holiday.", "What? NTA. I suspected immediately why B was actually invited. Good for you for asking follow up questions AND discussing it with B and giving them the opportunity to make up their own mind. If your sister had been honest from the outset, this might have gone differently for her. It\u2019s shitty of her to get B excited then drop the bomb on her.", "NTA. The fact that a mutual friend told you about your sisters plan means she had planned it, and knew if she told you, or B, you likely wouldn\u2019t have agreed, imo.", "NTA would it be fair of your sister to say the trip was based on her babysitting? definitely. Is it fair to not disclose that fact to your kid? Not at all.", "NTA - it\u2019s one thing if this had been asked but for it to be assumed of a kid is super shitty. You were absolutely right to stand up for B.", "NTA. Your sister planned to take advantage of your child.", "NTA\n\nYour kid said they don't want to go babysit. Case closed.", "NTA- God no. You did the right thing. I would have handled that completely different, which would have included some sore knuckles from my sister's and brother's faces, respectively, but you put your kid first. That's all that matters.", "NTA.\n\nGood on you for looking out for your kid. Sister was just looking for free childcare. If I were you, I'd keep an eye on her, Go NC/LC with her.", "Your sister and her husband were intentionally taking advantage of B and doing so it a very sneaky underhanded way.

Good for you putting a stop to it! \n\nNTA", "NTA - if your sister wanted to teach B responsibility, the first step world have been being responsible enough to tell both you and B beforehand why they wanted B to come.\n\nIt's one thing to make clear up front that they wanted a babysitter, it is 100% manipulative to plan to spring that on B once the vacation had started. Even if B was not autistic, it would be hard for a teen to say no to their aunt and uncle while away from their parents in a new place without an escape route. Given that B is autistic, this is even worse.\n\nYou are protecting your child but you are NOT being overprotective.\n\nAnd the proof is that, given all the information, B said they don't want to go.

Unpaid. Yeah, probably not.\n\nDefinitely not the AH.", "Who tf would leave 3 children in the care of another child that has autism in a foreign country. That sounds like a recipe for disaster.

The fact that you ran it by B what was going on and allowed them to update their decision given the new info, and B now chose to not go, absolutely absolves you of any AH liability", "NTA- your job is to teach your child how to take care of them self, this doesn't stop at any age.  New challenges with come every year and good parents are they to help guide their children thought out their entire life. \n\nBut your sister on the other hand is a huge one.   Sister figured she could bully \"B\" into taking care of the kids when they were away from all family, friends and in a strange environment.

However being autistic she might have had hard time saying \"no\". If your brother and his wife know this then they were clearly taking advantage of her. If they want to bar hop without the kids then they need to hire a babysitter and not take advantage of an autistic girl.", "NTA. B wasn't invited out of the kindness of their hearts but as a free babysitter.

I'm not sure how much of a 'fun vacation' B would have had saddled with babysitting and it seems like B concurs. \n\nMy parents took us on vacations my entire childhood--they were family vacations where we went camping or road trips or visiting family.  There was never an idea of us getting foisted off on 'free babysitting'. When my parents wanted fun grown up time, they hired a babysitter. But vacations were for US as a \\*family\\* to share experiences.  \n\n  \"Trying to teach them responsibility\" sounds pretty rich coming from someone who was trying to exploit a neurodivergent person.", "NTA", "nta", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are great, taking care of your kid. DON'T let your sister exploit her.", "NTA.  \n\nBenidorm is wild at the best of times, I can only imagine that they'd have been leaving B to keep an eye on the kids at night so they could go out to the strip (only a very few handful of bars allow in kids past 9) and then have B watch the kids whilst they recovered the following day.  I doubt she would have had much of a holiday.\n\nWell done you for calling them out.", "NTA. There's a reason your sister had no intention of telling you the real reason your child was invited. That's absolutely heartbreaking your own sister was going to use them for free child care. We all know damn well too that she wasn't going to take no for an answer.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter would have been in a situation were she would have felt pressured to say yes without a single person there to advocate for her and remind her that she does not have to do what she doesn\u2019t want to.", "NTA, simply because you told B and B decided for themselves.

So I'm going to rule NTA since they caught you by surprise and you reacted in anger.\n\nBut really, this should have been B's decision entirely. \n\nYou should have *asked* B what her preference was: \"Aunt Sissy and Uncle Bob will want you to babysit the children while you're on vacation. Is that something you'd be happy to do, or should we tell them you'd rather not go if that's the case? Or would you still like to go if they paid you for the babysitting?\"\n\nSo I agree with your brother that you *are* sort of \"cotton-wooling\" B. Lots of teens her age get \"mother's helpers\" gigs where they go on vacation with a family to take care of the kids, all expenses paid plus a stipend.", "Your brother was right, your sister was in the wrong, and in the end, you're NTA because you eventually let B decide on their own. A 17yo is definitely old enough to make a decision like that, and honestly it could have just as easily been a good lesson in the consequences of not standing up for themselves - if B saw that your sister just wanted free childcare and agreed anyway, then the boredom of providing free childcare for a week while on \"vacation\" would be annoying but not actually harmful. The right thing to do would probably have been to explain to B what your sister actually wanted, in case it wasn't as clear to B as it was to you (for autism reasons or for lack-of-life-experience reasons) and then let B know that you'd support their decision if that explanation changed B's mind. But at 17, B really should have the freedom to make decisions you think are bad, especially ones with stakes as low as this one. They won't learn to make good decisions otherwise!\n\nYou asked B eventually, so that's great, but it would have been even better if you did that right away instead of jumping to forbidding your kid from going despite what they said they wanted. If B's old and mature enough to go on this vacation and/or handle three kids, they're old and mature enough to decide on their own whether they want to do that. B might appreciate a low-stakes apology for you jumping in and overriding their decision because you thought you knew better. But overall, it looks like things ended up in the right place!\n\nAnd your sister was absolutely trying to pull a bait and switch with B and was kind of an AH here.", "ESH - \n\nyou cannot have it both ways... you can't \"break it to B that he can't go\" and then later slip in that \"...this is, ultimately, B's decision\". Yes, they made the same decision you did, but only after hearing your one-sided determination of your sisters' intentions.\n\nYour Sister pulling the easy babysitter ride along was a bigger AH, but there is enough to share here.", "NTA.\nYour sister and her husband are manipulative and liars.\n\nYour daughter wouldn\u2019t be their victim under cover of nice holidays paid from the bottom of their hearts.\n\nYou did well to protect your daughter knowing her weaknesses. But I\u2019d recommend you not to allow these disgusting AH from getting close to or have unsupervised contact with your kids.\n\nYou could tell them they are lucky you didn\u2019t involve the police for taking a minor abroad to force them into child labor/exploitation.", "INFO did you actually explain to B that they'd be expected to do some babysitting on the trip and ASK them if they wanted to go under those circumstances?  If that was the case then you weren't being an AH.  HOWEVER if you stripped B's agency and unilaterally TOLD them they couldn't go with them having no say in the matter that's total AH territory.  \n\nEither way your sister and her husband are AH for waiting until they were at the destination to tell B the trip came with strings.", "INFO\nWhat are the ages of your sisters kids?\nAre they well behaved and easy going or little terrors?\n(Based on the sister, id guess terrors)", "I mean if someone paid my way up go on a vacation I\u2019d be more than down to watch their kids while they get a little alone time.

NTA", "And he scariest thing about that is they seem to have no problem leaving an autistic 17yo alone with 3 kids in a foreign country with (I\u2019m assuming) no skills to be able to handle an emergency.  Hell, most adults visiting a foreign country would have no idea what to do in an emergency.  Not to mention no resources for keeping 3 kids entertained and happy, it sounds incredibly stressful to me and I\u2019m middle age.  And you know they\u2019d jsut blame the 17yo if something bad happened or even just if the kids were horrible while be babysat because there was nothing for them to do.  Did they really think an autistic 17yo would be able to handle taking 3 kids out and about in a foreign Courtney?  Or did they just expect them all to stay locked up in the hotel with the burden on 17 to keep them totally occupied and happy?  I can\u2019t imagine the aunt/uncle would have made the effort to plan out safe and fun experiences for all of them that the 17yo could handle alone.", "Once they are there, they don't have much option or outside support, either. Beyond that it sounds like the kiddo is easily talked into things and wants to please others to a fault.", "I upvoted your comment, started to scroll down, then scrolled back up and *hooted* at your screen name.", "Never said I was speaking for autistic people. I didn't even include it in my original comment because it didn't seem relevant. Rude and demeaning to call this a tantrum, it's literally the rules to not downvote if you disagree, downvoting is for spam and off topic, but whatever. I don't understand why my mild opinion is so spicy to people but I'm free to stop engaging, and I will. \n\nI replied not long after this was posted, and she hadn't included the information that she had talked to B and they were on board with the decision. I would never have commented if that was there originally, I only did so because every comment had no problem with an almost adults decisions being made for them, and I wanted B to have a voice. I think I was safe to assume that if they're at a functioning level to babysit, they're at a functioning level to communicate whether or not they want to babysit. Turns out they were part of the decision. Great news! \n\n I also said in the one other comment that I made that I was glad she stopped B from being taken advantage of, it could have definitely gone very wrong, as it did for you, and I'm so sorry that happened to you. I have been in a lot of situations where I didn't realize I was being manipulated and mistreated, or where I thought I was but also thought I had no choice. I have been in a lot of situations where people assumed they were helping by making decisions for me and it also made me feel manipulated and misunderstood. (I'm dealing with that right now, probably why I wasn't as kind as I usually try to be.) I'm glad B has a mom who cares about them and their well-being. I hope they can go on a cool trip together. \n\nNavigating the spectrum of support needs is definitely challenging. Listening to the autistic person in question is always a good place to start. Remembering no one is perfect is a good way to keep going. Good luck to you and I hope you find peace.", "Like... It gets worse the more I think about it, cause like, if you look at what's technically happening, it's trafficking a minor internationally for unpaid domestic labour.\n\nObviously B would be coming back home safely, but like... what the actual fuck.\n\nEdit: Yeah I've really horrified myself with that realization. Absolutely 1000% crucial to set the hard line that you're not fucking doing that - not because B was in danger here, but because normalizing this puts her at risk of not recognizing future sketchy situations.", "I have a suspicion they hid it because it wasn't going to be an hour/evening here or there or some assistance at a beach or whatever but a full-blown dump the kids on her and run-off for the entire trip.", "They want to take a 17 year old on vacation, with their 3 kids so they can have fun. \n\nThe 17 year old would have no choice but to \"agree\" to watch them as they will be alone with just them. And since your sister is already bragging about to her friends, you know that as the plan all along. \n\nYou don't invite someone on vacation just to put them to work. If your sister and her husband really want a break, don't bring the kids. They need to find someone to watch them for her. Someone other than you. \n\nNTA", "But did tell someone else - probably bragging about free babysitting - and then got all snitty when OP confronted her. NTA."]}
