I had  absolutely no issue with them going, I was rather touched that my sister  offered to take them, and just a little upset that my younger daughters  (F12 and F9) weren\u2019t invited, but I just thought that was down to their  age and I\u2019m not expecting my sister to take on three of my kids while  juggling three of her own, even for just a week.\n\nA  few days ago, I was chatting with a mutual friend of mine and my  sisters, and she mentioned something about how kind it was of B to look  after my sisters kids while on vacation. I was taken aback as this was  the first I\u2019d heard of it.\n\nI  called my sister and asked if maybe B had offered to keep an eye on  them. She told me no, B hadn\u2019t offered, and she hadn\u2019t asked them to,  but she was sure B wouldn\u2019t mind babysitting while her and her husband  enjoyed themselves.\n\nI didn\u2019t take  this well, and my sister said B can always say no and they\u2019d understand,  but here\u2019s the thing, B is autistic. They are very susceptible to  manipulation, and my sister knows they have a hard time saying no. I  told her that if the only reason she invited B was free childcare for  her and her husband to bar hop Benidorm, then they won\u2019t be going.\n\nI  had to break it to B that they can\u2019t go to Benidorm, and obviously they  were devastated, and my sister and her husband have been calling me all  the assholes under the sun, telling as much of the family that will  listen that I\u2019m breaking B\u2019s heart and they only wanted to take them on a  fun vacation and maybe teach them some responsibility as \u201cthey\u2019re going  to have a family of their own to take care of some day.\u201d\n\nMy  parents and husband are on my side, but my brother thinks I\u2019m being too  protective and I need to loosen the reigns and let B make the decision  for themselves. I\u2019ve explained the situation to B, and asked them if  they\u2019d be happy looking after their cousins on vacation, and B said that  they\u2019d prefer to go to have fun, and they\u2019ve decided they don\u2019t want to  go anymore, so this is, ultimately, B\u2019s decision.\n\nI  personally don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole, but now I\u2019m wondering if my  brother and sister are right and I\u2019m just wrapping B up in cotton wool,  so Reddit, AITH?", "created_utc": 1682861045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133qepn/aita_for_not_allowing_my_17yo_to_be_taken/", "score": 386, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What a manipulative thing to do, using your teenager as free childcare under the guise of a \"vacation.\" You were right to intervene.", "NTA.\n\nThey had no intention of asking B to babysit. It was legit going to be a situation where they show up and go \"here are the kids, here's money for food we'll be back in a couple hours have fun\" and they'd never get a single second of time alone or to explore or have fun because they'd be babysitting.\n\nAnd they'd keep doing it, promising a fun and amazing vacation only to leave them at the hotel with the kids.\n\nThey know that was their plan and now they can't do that hence the flipping out.\n\nThat didn't ask because they knew it was wrong.\n\nEdit: pronoun fix!", "NTA. \n\nYour sister and her husband however are. To know that a child cannot make certain decisions by themselves and to knowingly manipulate them. Some people are just pure evil. \n\nA parent's job is to ensure their child is safe and not taken advantage of. I'm proud of you for taking a stand.\n\nI hope you take B out for a day of fun.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister was clearly looking for a free babysitter. I'd go very low contact with her if I were you.", "NTA They were absolutely trying to take advantage of B and they knew it. Trying to teach your child \"some responsibility\" is frankly an awful attempt to excuse their poor behaviour.\n\nThey know that B is autistic, has difficulty saying no and can be manipulated. Their very deliberate actions towards B are so so gross.", "Wow, NTA, what a wild manipulation game they played there. With comments like \"so we can enjoy ourselves\" and \"teach responsibility\", B was always going to be their free child care. Anyone who says y t a especially as B, with fuller information, agrees with you, is nuts.", "Absolutely NTA. You are a great parent for watching out for your child. So lucky you found out your sister's plan before they went on holiday. Imagine B's reaction when they would have found out they were the childcare, rather than a guest, for the holiday.", "What? NTA. I suspected immediately why B was actually invited. Good for you for asking follow up questions AND discussing it with B and giving them the opportunity to make up their own mind. If your sister had been honest from the outset, this might have gone differently for her. It\u2019s shitty of her to get B excited then drop the bomb on her.", "NTA. The fact that a mutual friend told you about your sisters plan means she had planned it, and knew if she told you, or B, you likely wouldn\u2019t have agreed, imo.", "NTA would it be fair of your sister to say the trip was based on her babysitting? definitely. Is it fair to not disclose that fact to your kid? Not at all.", "NTA - it\u2019s one thing if this had been asked but for it to be assumed of a kid is super shitty. You were absolutely right to stand up for B.", "NTA. Your sister planned to take advantage of your child.", "NTA\n\nYour kid said they don't want to go babysit. Case closed.", "NTA- God no. You did the right thing. I would have handled that completely different, which would have included some sore knuckles from my sister's and brother's faces, respectively, but you put your kid first. That's all that matters.", "NTA.\n\nGood on you for looking out for your kid. Sister was just looking for free childcare. If I were you, I'd keep an eye on her, Go NC/LC with her.", "Your sister and her husband were intentionally taking advantage of B and doing so it a very sneaky underhanded way.  What if B went, got stuck watching the children, and then never shared or fully communicated with you what had happened? Your sister could have continued using B as free labor under the guise of altruistic vacations.  \nAnyone who thinks this is okay is a not a person I\u2019d want around my family.   Good for you putting a stop to it! \n\nNTA", "NTA - if your sister wanted to teach B responsibility, the first step world have been being responsible enough to tell both you and B beforehand why they wanted B to come.\n\nIt's one thing to make clear up front that they wanted a babysitter, it is 100% manipulative to plan to spring that on B once the vacation had started. Even if B was not autistic, it would be hard for a teen to say no to their aunt and uncle while away from their parents in a new place without an escape route. Given that B is autistic, this is even worse.\n\nYou are protecting your child but you are NOT being overprotective.\n\nAnd the proof is that, given all the information, B said they don't want to go. WHO WOULD?\n\nYour sister is deflecting her own AHness onto you because you ruined her plan for a babysitter on vacation. Don't let her do that to you or B. You're setting a great example for your kid.", "NTA better you get her not to go than her go and be used. Not exactly safe to rely on an underage girl to look after kids in any case", "NTA, good on you for protecting your kid.", "NTA\n\nYour sister and BIL were trying to take advantage of a naive child and they're trying to make you the AH for telling her the truth?\n\nWow. \n\nIf your brother is so concerned about people deciding for themselves does that mean he wants to go a babysit three small children for a week? Unpaid. Yeah, probably not.\n\nDefinitely not the AH.", "Who tf would leave 3 children in the care of another child that has autism in a foreign country. That sounds like a recipe for disaster. And like your sister was trying to abuse your ND child as slave labor/indentured servant.\n\nNTA. But your sister is one and I wouldn't allow her around any of your kids unsupervised.", "Wow, your sister is devious. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nGet the mutual friend who gave you the heads up a nice bottle of wine or some flowers as a Thank You gift. I doubt her letting it slip was an accident. \n\nYour sister is a huge AH. You had every right to go Mama Bear on her.", "NTA.  The fact that you ran it by B what was going on and allowed them to update their decision given the new info, and B now chose to not go, absolutely absolves you of any AH liability", "NTA- your job is to teach your child how to take care of them self, this doesn't stop at any age.  New challenges with co.e every year and good parents are they to help guide their children thought out their entire life. \n\nBut your sister on the other hand is a huge one.   Sister figured she could bully \"B\" into taking care of the kids when they were away from all family, friends and in a strangle environment.   If she felt she was doing nothing wrong and child care would be on a willing basis she would have talked about it with \"B\" prior to planning the trip.", "NTA, your sister knew what she was doing, and she should be ashamed", "NTA You obviously made a decision that B would have herself. However being autistic she might have had hard time saying \"no\". If your brother and his wife know this then they were clearly taking advantage of her. If they want to bar hop without the kids then they need to hire a babysitter and not take advantage of an autistic girl.", "NTA. B wasn't invited out of the kindness of their hearts but as a free babysitter.  Glad you informed B what was up and they made the decision that they didn't want to go.", "NTA and you deserve a Parent of the Month award, for looking out for your daughter.  I'm not sure how much of a 'fun vacation' B would have had saddled with babysitting and it seems like B concurs. \n\nMy parents took us on vacations my entire childhood--they were family vacations where we went camping or road trips or visiting family.  There was never an idea of us getting foisted off on 'free babysitting'. When my parents wanted fun grown up time, they hired a babysitter. But vacations were for US as a \\*family\\* to share experiences.  \n\n  \"Trying to teach them responsibility\" sounds pretty rich coming from someone who was trying to exploit a neurodivergent person.", "NTA", "nta", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are great, taking care of your kid. DON'T let your sister exploit her.", "NTA.  \n\nBenidorm is wild at the best of times, I can only imagine that they'd have been leaving B to keep an eye on the kids at night so they could go out to the strip (only a very few handful of bars allow in kids past 9) and then have B watch the kids whilst they recovered the following day.  I doubt she would have had much of a holiday.\n\nWell done you for calling them out.", "NTA. There's a reason your sister had no intention of telling you the real reason your child was invited. That's absolutely heartbreaking your own sister was going to use them for free child care. We all know damn well too that she wasn't going to take no for an answer.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter would have been in a situation were she would have felt pressured to say yes without a single person there to advocate for her and remind her that she does not have to do what she doesn\u2019t want to.", "NTA, simply because you told B and B decided for themselves. End of story.", "NTA\u2014 you did good, mama. You enabled your child to stand up for *themself*, and it\u2019s one of the greatest things we can do for our children.", "NTA and if they force B to take care of them in exchange for food it can be bordering on human trafficking.", "*reins.\n\nI would have explained the situation to my kid and let them decide at that age.\n\nBut NTA, you know your kid and are completely within the realm of normal reactions to people trying to exploit your child.", "The far greater weight of the assholeness is on your sister and her husband, for expecting to manipulate B into babysitting instead of being direct and honest, to both you and B, about B's role on the trip. So I'm going to rule NTA since they caught you by surprise and you reacted in anger.\n\nBut really, this should have been B's decision entirely. \n\nYou should have *asked* B what her preference was: \"Aunt Sissy and Uncle Bob will want you to babysit the children while you're on vacation. Is that something you'd be happy to do, or should we tell them you'd rather not go if that's the case? Or would you still like to go if they paid you for the babysitting?\"\n\nSo I agree with your brother that you *are* sort of \"cotton-wooling\" B. Lots of teens her age get \"mother's helpers\" gigs where they go on vacation with a family to take care of the kids, all expenses paid plus a stipend.", "Your brother was right, your sister was in the wrong, and in the end, you're NTA because you eventually let B decide on their own. A 17yo is definitely old enough to make a decision like that, and honestly it could have just as easily been a good lesson in the consequences of not standing up for themselves - if B saw that your sister just wanted free childcare and agreed anyway, then the boredom of providing free childcare for a week while on \"vacation\" would be annoying but not actually harmful. The right thing to do would probably have been to explain to B what your sister actually wanted, in case it wasn't as clear to B as it was to you (for autism reasons or for lack-of-life-experience reasons) and then let B know that you'd support their decision if that explanation changed B's mind. But at 17, B really should have the freedom to make decisions you think are bad, especially ones with stakes as low as this one. They won't learn to make good decisions otherwise!\n\nYou asked B eventually, so that's great, but it would have been even better if you did that right away instead of jumping to forbidding your kid from going despite what they said they wanted. If B's old and mature enough to go on this vacation and/or handle three kids, they're old and mature enough to decide on their own whether they want to do that. B might appreciate a low-stakes apology for you jumping in and overriding their decision because you thought you knew better. But overall, it looks like things ended up in the right place!\n\nAnd your sister was absolutely trying to pull a bait and switch with B and was kind of an AH here.", "ESH - \n\nyou cannot have it both ways... you can't \"break it to B that he can't go\" and then later slip in that \"...this is, ultimately, B's decision\". Yes, they made the same decision you did, but only after hearing your one-sided determination of your sisters' intentions.\n\nYour Sister pulling the easy babysitter ride along was a bigger AH, but there is enough to share here.", "NTA.\nYour sister and her husband are manipulative and liars.\n\nYour daughter wouldn\u2019t be their victim under cover of nice holidays paid from the bottom of their hearts.\n\nYou did well to protect your daughter knowing her weaknesses. But I\u2019d recommend you not to allow these disgusting AH from getting close to or have unsupervised contact with your kids.\n\nYou could tell them they are lucky you didn\u2019t involve the police for taking a minor abroad to force them into child labor/exploitation.", "INFO did you actually explain to B that they'd be expected to do some babysitting on the trip and ASK them if they wanted to go under those circumstances?  If that was the case then you weren't being an AH.  HOWEVER if you stripped B's agency and unilaterally TOLD them they couldn't go with them having no say in the matter that's total AH territory.  \n\nEither way your sister and her husband are AH for waiting until they were at the destination to tell B the trip came with strings.", "INFO\nWhat are the ages of your sisters kids?\nAre they well behaved and easy going or little terrors?\n(Based on the sister, id guess terrors)", "I mean if someone paid my way up go on a vacation I\u2019d be more than down to watch their kids while they get a little alone time. However you are NTA because your sister should have been up front", "ESH. Why is it acceptable to treat autistic people like they don't have thoughts of their own? Your sister sucks for manipulating them and you suck for not including them in the decision and just dumping a huge change on them to deal with, taking away all of their agency. Both my sister and I went on vacations with my aunt as babysitters (to be fair, she asked first) and it's one of my best childhood \nmemories.\n\nEDIT: cool to be an autistic person answering a question about an autistic person and getting downvoted. At this point participating in this sub is self harm and I gotta stop. Y'all assholes can have fun judging yourselves.", "If the B knows she is expected to baby sit, nothing wrong with that.", "Not going to judge because autism is different in everyone, none of us can know B's issues and generally the mum is the best judge .\n\nI am concerned that your sister apparently planned for B to babysit without mentioning it beforehand to B, but she said B could always say 'no'.\n\nI understand your concern that B might have difficulty saying 'no' but tbh on holiday with her aunt is probably the safest place for B to learn and to take on some responsibility.\n\nAlso you dont say f your sister was paying for the whole trip for B (in which case it isnt 'free childcare') or whether B was expected to pay her own way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They wouldn\u2019t be as mad if they only planned on utilizing B once or twice, the fact that they are enraged means they intended to use B the entire trip.", "NTA, but you can ask B what they would like to do with the new babysitting expectations and go from there", ">I\u2019m not expecting my sister to take on three of my kids while juggling three of her own, even for just a week.\n\nIt was right here, that I knew exactly what you were gonna say next \n\nNTA", "I can't believe that name was available... Lmao", "NTA! They totally manipulated and coerced your 17yo for their own ends.", "NTA. \n\nYou did the right thing by informing B about this plan for them on the, \"vacation.\"\n\nYour sister is the complete AH for her sneaky plan, and she's the one who is upset because you found out about it.\n\nYou're an awesome Momma Bear to your teen! You presented the information to B and let them make their own decisions about the trip.", "As an autistic adult, you did the right thing. I would have accepted the free vacation and then felt cornered the first time they went out alone feeling like I OWED it to them and would have had no choice. OP, NTA. OP's sister and BIL, AH extraordinaire!", "NTA. Sister should have asked in advance. I think explaining the situation and offering B the choice is the best route, and it sounds like you did that.", "NTA\n\n>My parents and husband are on my side, but my brother thinks I\u2019m being too protective and I need to loosen the reigns and let B make the decision for themselves. \n\nIt sounds like you would have let her make the decision if your sister had actually ***asked*** B and allowed them to actually have a decision to make.", "NTA. They didn\u2019t even have the decency to pretend like they weren\u2019t trying to get a free babysitter out of this. The fact that they said that was a clear goal of theirs to teach her responsibility or whatever, is very deceptive and manipulative towards your daughter. Given how easily they came up with this plan, I would take any future offers of theirs involving your daughter with a big dose of skepticism.", "NTA \n\nYour sister absolutely planned to take advantage of B and hid it from everyone other than your family. She is a massive AH.", "NTA. You are absolutely right that they intentionally deceived your kid. If they wanted informed consent, they would have asked \"Would you be willing to come with us and watch the kids while we do adult stuff? You'll get to be away from home and have at least a little time to see the sites and stuff, but it would really be more like a working vacation and a big favor that we'd be grateful for.\"\n\nInstead, they left out any detail that would make them even think twice. The ONLY conclusion you can come to is that their absolute intention was to get them out there, away from home, and leverage their authority and the 17yo's utter lack of material support to stand against them to force them to do their bidding. \n\nThis wasn't an oversight, it was despicable. Villainous shit.", "NTA. Your sister and BIL knew exactly what they were doing. The fact that she told others that B was going to be childcare on their vacation while making it seem like a surprise invitation tells you everything you need to know. Tell everyone that you explained to B why they were invited, and they declined because they were never told that they were the trip babysitter. Call out her manipulative lie and let her explain why child care was never mentioned in the invite to B, but everyone else knew about it. Edit: pronouns", "NTA. Your kid was being set up. They wanted a babysitter and lack the courtesy of discussing it with you or B. Other people knew why B was invited. You rock. Tell B they have no right to be manipulated like that. Her Aunt was trying to take advantage of her. Family does not mean someone is a good person.", "I'm sorry, your sister decided it was her job to teach B responsibility? Fuuuuck that. The audacity! \n\nYou: NTA. Your sister, on the other hand, is a real manipulative piece of work.", "Yes this. It's not the baby-sitting that bothers me but the hiding it.That's the problem. NTA\n\nGood looking out for your B.", "Asking? More like telling. This selfish pair wouldn't ask, they would expect. B would have felt cornered and like they had no option to say no, at least if I'm interpreting OP correctly.", "Absolutely NTA. I had an aunt and uncle who had a free ticket to the USA when I was a broke college student. They invited me to go along with them, they would get two rooms in the hotel and I'd share with my 14 year old cousin. After we'd arrived in the hotel and checked out the room and everything, my aunt and I were having a drink in the bar. It was about 9pm and my aunt said to me \"are you going back to the room soon?\" I was surprised and said \"uh...well I was planning to sit here and finish this drink?\" And she said \".....okay....it's just that...your cousin's in the room on her own?\"\n\n\n My aunt and uncle are super passive aggressive and allergic to honest communication. So just sat there and looked at her, and shrugged with a \"so???\" expression on my face. And that was the last time anyone suggested that I curtail my activities so I could babysit a fourteen year old. But I wouldn't expect an autistic teen to be able to set boundaries like that, and I'm so glad you were able to step in and do that for them. \n\n\nAs long as you have talked with them about how their vacation actually would have been work for them, and how their aunt and uncle were planning to take advantage of them, it can be a valuable learning experience for them about standing up for themselves and how people can omit the full truth when they want something from you.\n\nEdit: fixed the pronouns, my apologies", "Yes. From experience it is difficult and scary to say no when you are far away from your home. I am NT and at 16 I was very conscious that I had no one to turn to and it could get ugly if I refused. There was no way my parents could come get me quickly and there was no way I could leave.", "This is what I don\u2019t understand.\n\nIf you want free time that involves no kids, don\u2019t have children.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to worry about finding babysitters and having to pay them, don\u2019t have children.\n\nIf you want to have fun alone but don\u2019t want the responsibility of your kids bc you have to look after them, don\u2019t have children.\n\nThey had children, so they should know a lot of vacations are going to be family vacations and they will have absolutely zero privacy. They just wanted a free babysitter and feel no guilt about it bc they bought their family member a ticket. They\u2019re trying to pass this off as a tit-for-tat situation when in reality they had planned to dump the kids on B and told everyone else except B.", "B's pronouns are they/them according to the post, FYI.", "It's not their place to teach them anyway. I'm so glad someone spilled the beans before the vacation", "This right here! She'd told people already it was going to happen and that's why she was coming. They had already decided to use B, there would be no requests", "I missed the part in the post where it was B's decision not to go.", "Don't they usually know that's what is expected and not spring it on them once they are out of reach from anyone who can come get them? OP updated i think and said that she told B the entire situation and why she had to cancel B going and B agreed that that was the best choice because they never agreed to be a babysitter nor had any idea that it was expected.", "They probably wouldn\u2019t use \u201cforce\u201d so in the eyes of the law, it would be fine. Morally it\u2019s wrong but they\u2019d probably use manipulation like \u201cThis would be nice for you to do.\u201d Or \u201cCan you watch them just one more time?\u201d", "Does it matter? B shouldn\u2019t have to babysit any kids they don\u2019t want to. Also, you can\u2019t judge the kids based on the parent.", "Yea, I find it weird that OP didn\u2019t even talk to her kid about it. He\u2019s 17, not 7. And if he can be trusted to watch little kids, he\u2019s high functioning. Did he ever get a say in the matter? \u201cHey B, your aunt wants you to help out by babysitting some nights on the trip. How do you feel about that?\u201d Maybe B wants to chill with his cousins a few nights, and it\u2019s not like it\u2019ll be the whole trip.", "Agreed. Totally weird OP didn\u2019t even ask if B was happy with this arrangement - just pulled the plug. The kid is going to be an adult in less than a year, time to start considering his opinion too.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if the sister was paying for B. That doesn\u2019t entitle her to childcare unless that was agreed upon already. It is unfair and manipulative to put anyone in that situation regardless of if B is autistic or not.", "Right! If they had said during the invitation, hey were going here and would love for you to join us but in exchange we\u2019d like you to watch the kid X amount of time while we\u2019re there that would\u2019ve been fine. They\u2019re allowed to ask and it would\u2019ve been understood by both parties before the trip how much they would be responsible for. I definitely would\u2019ve done this as a teenager in exchange for a fun trip depending on how much they asked.", "Exactly. If it had of offer had been presented honestly from the get go it would be B\u2019s decision to accept or not but this sounds like the sister is an AH", "Thanks! Fixed it!", "2nd sentence of 2nd to last paragraph", ">Don't they usually know that's what is expected and not spring it on them once they are out of reach from anyone who can come get them?\n\nYes, that's why I ruled NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>B agreed that that was the best choice because they never agreed to be a babysitter nor had any idea that it was expected.\n\nJust saying, OP should have *asked* B, not canceled on her behalf, even if B later agreed it was the correct decision (especially since B is so easily manipulated, she might have been responding to what she thought OP wanted to hear, and not her actual preference)."]}
