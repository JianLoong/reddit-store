I had  absolutely no issue with them going, I was rather touched that my sister  offered to take them, and just a little upset that my younger daughters  (F12 and F9) weren\u2019t invited, but I just thought that was down to their  age and I\u2019m not expecting my sister to take on three of my kids while  juggling three of her own, even for just a week.\n\nA  few days ago, I was chatting with a mutual friend of mine and my  sisters, and she mentioned something about how kind it was of B to look  after my sisters kids while on vacation. I was taken aback as this was  the first I\u2019d heard of it.\n\nI  called my sister and asked if maybe B had offered to keep an eye on  them. She told me no, B hadn\u2019t offered, and she hadn\u2019t asked them to,  but she was sure B wouldn\u2019t mind babysitting while her and her husband  enjoyed themselves.\n\nI didn\u2019t take  this well, and my sister said B can always say no and they\u2019d understand,  but here\u2019s the thing, B is autistic. They are very susceptible to  manipulation, and my sister knows they have a hard time saying no. I  told her that if the only reason she invited B was free childcare for  her and her husband to bar hop Benidorm, then they won\u2019t be going.\n\nI  had to break it to B that they can\u2019t go to Benidorm, and obviously they  were devastated, and my sister and her husband have been calling me all  the assholes under the sun, telling as much of the family that will  listen that I\u2019m breaking B\u2019s heart and they only wanted to take them on a  fun vacation and maybe teach them some responsibility as \u201cthey\u2019re going  to have a family of their own to take care of some day.\u201d\n\nMy  parents and husband are on my side, but my brother thinks I\u2019m being too  protective and I need to loosen the reigns and let B make the decision  for themselves. I\u2019ve explained the situation to B, and asked them if  they\u2019d be happy looking after their cousins on vacation, and B said that  they\u2019d prefer to go to have fun, and they\u2019ve decided they don\u2019t want to  go anymore, so this is, ultimately, B\u2019s decision.\n\nI  personally don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole, but now I\u2019m wondering if my  brother and sister are right and I\u2019m just wrapping B up in cotton wool,  so Reddit, AITH?", "created_utc": 1682861045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133qepn/aita_for_not_allowing_my_17yo_to_be_taken/", "score": 1327, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What a manipulative thing to do, using your teenager as free childcare under the guise of a \"vacation.\" You were right to intervene.", "NTA.\n\nThey had no intention of asking B to babysit. It was legit going to be a situation where they show up and go \"here are the kids, here's money for food we'll be back in a couple hours have fun\" and they'd never get a single second of time alone or to explore or have fun because they'd be babysitting.\n\nAnd they'd keep doing it, promising a fun and amazing vacation only to leave them at the hotel with the kids.\n\nThey know that was their plan and now they can't do that hence the flipping out.\n\nThat didn't ask because they knew it was wrong.\n\nEdit: pronoun fix!", "NTA. \n\nYour sister and her husband however are. To know that a child cannot make certain decisions by themselves and to knowingly manipulate them. Some people are just pure evil. \n\nA parent's job is to ensure their child is safe and not taken advantage of. I'm proud of you for taking a stand.\n\nI hope you take B out for a day of fun.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister was clearly looking for a free babysitter. I'd go very low contact with her if I were you.", "NTA They were absolutely trying to take advantage of B and they knew it. Trying to teach your child \"some responsibility\" is frankly an awful attempt to excuse their poor behaviour.\n\nThey know that B is autistic, has difficulty saying no and can be manipulated. Their very deliberate actions towards B are so so gross.", "Wow, NTA, what a wild manipulation game they played there. With comments like \"so we can enjoy ourselves\" and \"teach responsibility\", B was always going to be their free child care. Anyone who says y t a especially as B, with fuller information, agrees with you, is nuts.", "Absolutely NTA. You are a great parent for watching out for your child. So lucky you found out your sister's plan before they went on holiday. Imagine B's reaction when they would have found out they were the childcare, rather than a guest, for the holiday.", "What? NTA. I suspected immediately why B was actually invited. Good for you for asking follow up questions AND discussing it with B and giving them the opportunity to make up their own mind. If your sister had been honest from the outset, this might have gone differently for her. It\u2019s shitty of her to get B excited then drop the bomb on her.", "NTA. The fact that a mutual friend told you about your sisters plan means she had planned it, and knew if she told you, or B, you likely wouldn\u2019t have agreed, imo.", "NTA would it be fair of your sister to say the trip was based on her babysitting? definitely. Is it fair to not disclose that fact to your kid? Not at all.", "NTA - it\u2019s one thing if this had been asked but for it to be assumed of a kid is super shitty. You were absolutely right to stand up for B.", "NTA. Your sister planned to take advantage of your child.", "NTA\n\nYour kid said they don't want to go babysit. Case closed.", "NTA- God no. You did the right thing. I would have handled that completely different, which would have included some sore knuckles from my sister's and brother's faces, respectively, but you put your kid first. That's all that matters.", "NTA.\n\nGood on you for looking out for your kid. Sister was just looking for free childcare. If I were you, I'd keep an eye on her, Go NC/LC with her.", "Your sister and her husband were intentionally taking advantage of B and doing so it a very sneaky underhanded way.  What if B went, got stuck watching the children, and then never shared or fully communicated with you what had happened? Your sister could have continued using B as free labor under the guise of altruistic vacations.  \nAnyone who thinks this is okay is a not a person I\u2019d want around my family.   Good for you putting a stop to it! \n\nNTA", "NTA - if your sister wanted to teach B responsibility, the first step world have been being responsible enough to tell both you and B beforehand why they wanted B to come.\n\nIt's one thing to make clear up front that they wanted a babysitter, it is 100% manipulative to plan to spring that on B once the vacation had started. Even if B was not autistic, it would be hard for a teen to say no to their aunt and uncle while away from their parents in a new place without an escape route. Given that B is autistic, this is even worse.\n\nYou are protecting your child but you are NOT being overprotective.\n\nAnd the proof is that, given all the information, B said they don't want to go. WHO WOULD?\n\nYour sister is deflecting her own AHness onto you because you ruined her plan for a babysitter on vacation. Don't let her do that to you or B. You're setting a great example for your kid.", "NTA better you get her not to go than her go and be used. Not exactly safe to rely on an underage girl to look after kids in any case", "NTA, good on you for protecting your kid.", "NTA\n\nYour sister and BIL were trying to take advantage of a naive child and they're trying to make you the AH for telling her the truth?\n\nWow. \n\nIf your brother is so concerned about people deciding for themselves does that mean he wants to go a babysit three small children for a week? Unpaid. Yeah, probably not.\n\nDefinitely not the AH.", "Who tf would leave 3 children in the care of another child that has autism in a foreign country. That sounds like a recipe for disaster.

NTA.", "NTA. \n\nGet the mutual friend who gave you the heads up a nice bottle of wine or some flowers as a Thank You gift. I doubt her letting it slip was an accident. \n\nYour sister is a huge AH. You had every right to go Mama Bear on her.", "NTA.  The fact that you ran it by B what was going on and allowed them to update their decision given the new info, and B now chose to not go, absolutely absolves you of any AH liability", "NTA- your job is to teach your child how to take care of them self, this doesn't stop at any age.  New challenges with come every year and good parents are they to help guide their children thought out their entire life. \n\nBut your sister on the other hand is a huge one.   Sister figured she could bully \"B\" into taking care of the kids when they were away from all family, friends and in a strange environment.   If she felt she was doing nothing wrong and child care would be on a willing basis she would have talked about it with \"B\" prior to planning the trip.\n\nEdited type-o's", "NTA, your sister knew what she was doing, and she should be ashamed", "NTA You obviously made a decision that B would have herself. However being autistic she might have had hard time saying \"no\". If your brother and his wife know this then they were clearly taking advantage of her. If they want to bar hop without the kids then they need to hire a babysitter and not take advantage of an autistic girl.", "NTA. B wasn't invited out of the kindness of their hearts but as a free babysitter.  Glad you informed B what was up and they made the decision that they didn't want to go.", "NTA and you deserve a Parent of the Month award, for looking out for your daughter.  I'm not sure how much of a 'fun vacation' B would have had saddled with babysitting and it seems like B concurs. \n\nMy parents took us on vacations my entire childhood--they were family vacations where we went camping or road trips or visiting family.  There was never an idea of us getting foisted off on 'free babysitting'. When my parents wanted fun grown up time, they hired a babysitter. But vacations were for US as a \\*family\\* to share experiences.  \n\n  \"Trying to teach them responsibility\" sounds pretty rich coming from someone who was trying to exploit a neurodivergent person.", "NTA", "nta", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are great, taking care of your kid. DON'T let your sister exploit her.", "NTA.  \n\nBenidorm is wild at the best of times, I can only imagine that they'd have been leaving B to keep an eye on the kids at night so they could go out to the strip (only a very few handful of bars allow in kids past 9) and then have B watch the kids whilst they recovered the following day.  I doubt she would have had much of a holiday.\n\nWell done you for calling them out.", "NTA. There's a reason your sister had no intention of telling you the real reason your child was invited. That's absolutely heartbreaking your own sister was going to use them for free child care. We all know damn well too that she wasn't going to take no for an answer.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter would have been in a situation were she would have felt pressured to say yes without a single person there to advocate for her and remind her that she does not have to do what she doesn\u2019t want to.", "NTA, simply because you told B and B decided for themselves. End of story.", "NTA\u2014 you did good, mama. You enabled your child to stand up for *themself*, and it\u2019s one of the greatest things we can do for our children.", "NTA and if they force B to take care of them in exchange for food it can be bordering on human trafficking.", "*reins.\n\nI would have explained the situation to my kid and let them decide at that age.\n\nBut NTA, you know your kid and are completely within the realm of normal reactions to people trying to exploit your child.", "The far greater weight of the assholeness is on your sister and her husband, for expecting to manipulate B into babysitting instead of being direct and honest, to both you and B, about B's role on the trip. So I'm going to rule NTA since they caught you by surprise and you reacted in anger.\n\nBut really, this should have been B's decision entirely. \n\nYou should have *asked* B what her preference was: \"Aunt Sissy and Uncle Bob will want you to babysit the children while you're on vacation. Is that something you'd be happy to do, or should we tell them you'd rather not go if that's the case? Or would you still like to go if they paid you for the babysitting?\"\n\nSo I agree with your brother that you *are* sort of \"cotton-wooling\" B. Lots of teens her age get \"mother's helpers\" gigs where they go on vacation with a family to take care of the kids, all expenses paid plus a stipend.", "Your brother was right, your sister was in the wrong, and in the end, you're NTA because you eventually let B decide on their own. A 17yo is definitely old enough to make a decision like that, and honestly it could have just as easily been a good lesson in the consequences of not standing up for themselves - if B saw that your sister just wanted free childcare and agreed anyway, then the boredom of providing free childcare for a week while on \"vacation\" would be annoying but not actually harmful. The right thing to do would probably have been to explain to B what your sister actually wanted, in case it wasn't as clear to B as it was to you (for autism reasons or for lack-of-life-experience reasons) and then let B know that you'd support their decision if that explanation changed B's mind. But at 17, B really should have the freedom to make decisions you think are bad, especially ones with stakes as low as this one. They won't learn to make good decisions otherwise!\n\nYou asked B eventually, so that's great, but it would have been even better if you did that right away instead of jumping to forbidding your kid from going despite what they said they wanted. If B's old and mature enough to go on this vacation and/or handle three kids, they're old and mature enough to decide on their own whether they want to do that. B might appreciate a low-stakes apology for you jumping in and overriding their decision because you thought you knew better. But overall, it looks like things ended up in the right place!\n\nAnd your sister was absolutely trying to pull a bait and switch with B and was kind of an AH here.", "ESH - \n\nyou cannot have it both ways... you can't \"break it to B that he can't go\" and then later slip in that \"...this is, ultimately, B's decision\". Yes, they made the same decision you did, but only after hearing your one-sided determination of your sisters' intentions.\n\nYour Sister pulling the easy babysitter ride along was a bigger AH, but there is enough to share here.", "NTA.\nYour sister and her husband are manipulative and liars.\n\nYour daughter wouldn\u2019t be their victim under cover of nice holidays paid from the bottom of their hearts.\n\nYou did well to protect your daughter knowing her weaknesses. But I\u2019d recommend you not to allow these disgusting AH from getting close to or have unsupervised contact with your kids.\n\nYou could tell them they are lucky you didn\u2019t involve the police for taking a minor abroad to force them into child labor/exploitation.", "INFO did you actually explain to B that they'd be expected to do some babysitting on the trip and ASK them if they wanted to go under those circumstances?  If that was the case then you weren't being an AH.  HOWEVER if you stripped B's agency and unilaterally TOLD them they couldn't go with them having no say in the matter that's total AH territory.  \n\nEither way your sister and her husband are AH for waiting until they were at the destination to tell B the trip came with strings.", "INFO\nWhat are the ages of your sisters kids?\nAre they well behaved and easy going or little terrors?\n(Based on the sister, id guess terrors)", "I mean if someone paid my way up go on a vacation I\u2019d be more than down to watch their kids while they get a little alone time. However you are NTA because your sister should have been up front", "ESH. Why is it acceptable to treat autistic people like they don't have thoughts of their own? Your sister sucks for manipulating them and you suck for not including them in the decision and just dumping a huge change on them to deal with, taking away all of their agency. Both my sister and I went on vacations with my aunt as babysitters (to be fair, she asked first) and it's one of my best childhood \nmemories.\n\nEDIT: cool to be an autistic person answering a question about an autistic person and getting downvoted. At this point participating in this sub is self harm and I gotta stop. Y'all assholes can have fun judging yourselves.", "If the B knows she is expected to baby sit, nothing wrong with that.", "Not going to judge because autism is different in everyone, none of us can know B's issues and generally the mum is the best judge .\n\nI am concerned that your sister apparently planned for B to babysit without mentioning it beforehand to B, but she said B could always say 'no'.\n\nI understand your concern that B might have difficulty saying 'no' but tbh on holiday with her aunt is probably the safest place for B to learn and to take on some responsibility.\n\nAlso you dont say f your sister was paying for the whole trip for B (in which case it isnt 'free childcare') or whether B was expected to pay her own way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they want B to provide travel child care they should be upfront about it and clearly layout the terms which includes the hours they expect her to work and the compensation.", ">I\u2019m breaking B\u2019s heart and they only wanted to take them on a fun vacation and maybe teach them some responsibility as \u201cthey\u2019re going to have a family of their own to take care of some day.\u201d\n\nThat is some serious lying. NTA. Good for looking out for your kid!!!\n\n>I\u2019ve explained the situation to B, and asked them if they\u2019d be happy looking after their cousins on vacation, and B said that they\u2019d prefer to go to have fun, and they\u2019ve decided they don\u2019t want to go anymore...\n\nSo...B made this decision.", "NTA. As an autistic person I usually find it very difficult to say no especially when there's pressure (older people or more than one person asking for the same thing). Thank you for being a good mother.", "NTA. Good looking out, absolutely abhorrent behaviour from your sister. That's low af and they should be ashamed", "NTA", "NTA- They're the ones trying to manipulate your kid into baysitting for them.\n\nEdit: Even your parents are on your side. The only ones not are the ones who want to manipulate their niece/nephew into babysitting for them.", "NTA. More importantly, sounds like you're a good mom. B does indeed deserve agency but at the same time some looking after. Sounds to me like you are hitting the perfect balance.", "NTA.  If they'd asked B outright to babysit in exchange for going along, then that would be fine (assuming B wanted to accept the deal), but they're being manipulative and shady.  B may be a teen, but they're still a kid, and they still need parenting.  Stepping in and protecting them from being used is your job.", "YTA for not bringing this to B now and talking through the options with her, which would have protected her just as well but also given her a choice.", "NTA. As a teenager who DID go on vacations to babysit - IT WAS DISCUSSED PRIOR TO AGREEING. What, if any, payment, what was expected, when I\u2019d be babysitting, how many kids, no surprise kids, all that sort of stuff. Discussed prior to my, and my parents, final agreement on the trip. \n\nThe closest I ever got to having babysitting sprung on me was \u201cwatch all these kids for 15 minutes maximum while we help with all the carrying.\u201d The other option was carry, so I amused the kids.", "NTA. I hoped you explained to B what her aunt\u2019s plan was so she better understands it would not have been a vacation for them.", "NTA, I applaud you my dear for keeping your child's best interest and comfort at heart. Your sister on the other hand is definitely The AH. If someone tried to take advantage of my NT child it would be hell on earth for the person", "Also it is not their responsibility to teach your child how to take care of children; that was bogus.", "You are a good mom, super NTA.", "NTA", "Not enough info from your sisters side.  ESH.", "They are gaslighting you to try and make you second guess your reaction. NTAH. Stand up for her she'll appreciate it when she gets older.", "Nta and good for you sticking up for her.  Also good on your friend for telling you the real reason your daughter was invited.  Your sister is a major ahole here, and wtf is with your brother?", "If your daughter is easily manipulated, I think the way to counteract that is to give her the information - explain how your sister may be taking advantage of her - and let her make her own decisions. Good that you asked for her opinion, but you should've done that before getting into an argument with your sister and canceling B's vacation. Now it's hard to tell if it's really her decision, or she was pressured by you, or she feels it would be awkward to go after you got into an argument with you sister. YTA (though so is your sister).", "This is likely also why they didn't invite you or your other, younger children. They wanted a babysitter.\n\nNTA", "They really wanted to pull a fast one on your AUTISTIC CHILD. Wow and they are your family too. This is fucked up in multiple ways and I would have flipped a literal table on them \n\nNTA", " B seems happy with the decision, and your sister is just bitter that her horrible little plan didn\u2019t work out.", "I am autistic and if this was me at that age, I'd have been really upset at just at not getting to go on holiday. She might not be grateful right now, but the fact that you've stepped in to advocate for her is amazing, and you're 100%, from the bottom of my heart, not the asshole. \n\nI don't want to make assumptions about your daughters specific support needs or overall intelligence, but it would probably be very valuable to explain clearly and carefully that it is not OK for her to be used as a free childcare, even if she thinks that she doesn't mind. It's also likely that she genuinely isn't able to perceive how fucking scummy her aunt and her husband are being. \n\nThis is 100% not the fault of her autism, this is the fault of two people who decided to take advantage of a person who they know is vulnerable to being taken advantage of. I think you need to make it very clear to her that you appreciate her generosity and willingness to help, but that you can't stand by and allow adults to take the absolute piss out of her. \n\nI'm actually furious, sorry. nta times nine million and well done for advocating on your kids' behalf on this one. Just try not to alienate her too much because this is a massive betrayal by people she probably assumed that she could trust to do better.", "NTA \n\nThat is so slimy of them! \n\nAnd were they even going to offer to pay? I can\u2019t believe that everyone is okay with them taking advantage of B. \n\nBrutal! Good looking out mom!", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister used her niece for free babysitting, even going so far as to bring her niece on a \u201cfun\u201d trip in order to use her. Even if your daughter had offered to babysit, she still shouldn\u2019t be expected to do it. She\u2019s still a kid, she still ended down time on vacation.", "NTA. You laid out the \"fine print\" to your child, so they have all the information needed to make an informed decision. Good job!", "NTA.  You did right and helped your daughter understand a confusing situation and make an informed choice.   Yes room to make mistakes matter, but so does having close family that don't push her into those situations in the first place.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nKnowing Benidorm, your sis and husband would be out until the crack of dawn and B would not only have to babysit at night but most of the day too so they could sleep off their hangovers by the pool.", "NTA.  I have a 28 year old autistic son, and family members try to rope him into things all the time because they know he isn\u2019t able to say no.  It\u2019s extremely frustrating, because they always frame it as something positive, \u201cit\u2019ll get him out of the house\u201d, \u201che might enjoy working with his hands\u201d, \u201cit\u2019ll be good for him\u201d, etc.  No, it\u2019s taking advantage of a vulnerable person, and expecting them to be grateful.", "And exactly why the younger girls weren't invited.", "And the brother figured if it worked out ok, he could benefit in the future.", "Exactly. Why couldn\u2019t they just say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going on vacation and we\u2019d love some alone time- can B come tag along, babysit here and there, and in exchange, we\u2019ll pay their way, maybe give them a little spending cash?\u201d This is just so weird.", "If they had actually meant to do the correct thing then they could have approached B beforehand and asked them if they would go on the trip and babysit with some type of compensation such as working 3 days and 3 days freedom or work in the morning and get afternoons free, or paying them. There were ways to do this in a NTA way but they purposefully didn't do that and that is the whole problem here. They had planned to trap and manipulate B.", "\ud83c\udfa4\u2b07\ufe0f This comment right here, OP! They knew B would feel pressured, they knew it was a f#cked up request, so they hid it. They INTENDED to manipulate your autistic child. That is incredibly disgusting. \n\nCommenter, I can only award you the poor man's reddit award- \ud83c\udfc6", "Exactly. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with asking an older cousin to come along to mind the kids if the parents are clear about the gig upfront and the child is compensated for the work. But they went literally the opposite direction with this, despite clearly having planned it out from the outset. That\u2019s really gross.", "True", "NTA. The fact that you ran it by B what was going on and allowed them to update their decision given the new info, and B now chose to not go, absolutely absolves you of any AH liability", "Yea they did I think.\n\nEdit: That's why she/he said no.", "no", "They asked their kid and they said no...", "OP is definitely NTA and her sister is a giant ah.\n\nBut let's not blow things wildly out of proportion...", "Benidorm is a shithole. Kid is not missing anything except for watching uneducated leather skinned Brits get shitfaced while frying themselves in the sun 50 shades too dark. And if you didn't read her post properly, when the kid found out about the whole deal they didn't want to go anymore.\n\nI can see you're from the US, imagine going to some low cost all inclusive resort in Florida and it would still probably be better than Benidorm. There's a show on Netflix with the exact same name and it depicts it perfectly. The whole country it's in (Spain) hates the place.", "Could also be read as OP not wanting to reveal the gender of her child in case people reacted differently, e.g. people often expect daughters to be better at or more willing to babysit than sons for completely illogical and sexist reasons. \n\nAlmost every AITA post comes with a thousand screaming babies crying \"what about if the genders were flipped\" or claiming Reddit is harsher on \\[insert gender here\\] so it's pretty sensible to remove genders entirely if you want an unbiased opinion.", "Nah, they hid it because they didn\u2019t have good intentions as they tried to pretend they did. It wasn\u2019t bonding time but free childcare and if anything goes wrong, B will be blamed for it.\n\n\u00ab\u00a0They are going to have a family of their own someday\u00a0\u00bb so let\u2019s use this excuse to manipulate and traumatis\u00e9 a 17yo.\n\nNTA for protecting your child and yes, always explain to your child and let them be the judge.", "Yea, especially since they probably knew that B would decline if they were straightforward about it.", "Autism aside, I think almost anyone, especially a 17 y/o, would have trouble saying no at that point. They\u2019ve taken you on a free vacation so your hands are basically tied. You could say no, but now you\u2019ve pissed off the people you\u2019re vacationing with and now the trip is ruined for you regardless", "They could have hired a damn nanny..", "I'm sorry that happened to you.", "People can have children and be good parents and still need a break from time to time. This is why babysitting exists. That's not the issue here. The issue is that these particular parents were planning on taking advantage of B and getting them to babysit without letting her know that's what she was signing up for.\n\nNTA, though I would have taken the situation to B first to see if they were still interested before turning it down on her behalf (which OP did eventually do anyway).\n\nEDIT: corrected gender language", "And now they\u2019ve proven themselves untrustworthy. If you can\u2019t trust someone with your kids, you can\u2019t trust them. Period.", "I humbly accept. Thanks. \n\nIntention is everything. If one can\u2019t be honest, about their intentions, that says a lot.", "Gross is the perfect word for it. All kinds of ick.", "This shit is pretty common among the autism mom demographic who are controlling their undiagnosed and untreated issues by controlling what happens to their kid. Its not surprising to me that they have no issue imposing decisions on an almost adult, or that I'm getting downvoted for pointing it out. \n\nI will say I understand their concern for their child getting manipulated and it easily could have ended up being the whole trip - considering they didn't even ask, its a red flag that B could be in a situation where they don't feel they can say no and I think it's good the mom is protecting them from that, but she needs to do it in a way that helps B develop agency - they're not always going to have their mom to make their decisions for them.", "I was referring to the mum's post where she said her sister was wanting 'free childcare'.\n\nI get where you are coming from, but the sister said she might ask but it wasn't a problem if the answer was 'no'. I don't see anything wrong with that.  \n\n\nI do think the conditions need to made clear at the time of the offer though.", "Fine, talk to the kid about that too. I'm not saying that going is the best choice! But at the end of the day this is a decision that a 17 year old can make. This isn't a dangerous situation that requires direct intervention, the worst case scenario is they have a crappy week that they thought was going to be fun and learns that lesson for the future.", "Exactly!! Not mentioning the babysitting upfront is sneaky and dishonest.", "I did exactly this with my niece. She was happy to watch the 3 kids 2 nights  and give me a hand at the beach a couple hours a day in exchange for free 10 day Caribbean vacation. She still had tons of free time to do what she wanted at the resort. We only asked that she didn't leave the resort without us.", "Yeah, I have a 17-year old who has a pretty good head on her shoulders, but she would have been frantically texting me saying, \u201cMama, I had no idea what to say!
