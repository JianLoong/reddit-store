You are kind to take in a kitty with poor chances of adoption. The cat is grateful for sure and you did a good thing, and so what if the cat doesn't have an ear? Worth of a cat and of that relationship is not stored in the ears. Sad your sister/parents don't understand that and think cat is meant to be a pretty accessory.
