The person that rescued her explained that it was abandoned because the people who had it moved away and left her. A 3-4 months old kitty left on the street because she was just one of those Christmas presents parents give to their kids. I wasn't even looking to adopt so I waited a couple of days to think about it and see if she was adopted but just couldn't stop thinking about her and knew somewhere in my heart that she was going to be with me. The person that rescued her posted a second time \"Still haven't found a home for this baby\" and a huge AH wrote in the comments \"well, she is kind of ugly\". My blood was boiling, what an awful thing to say! I loved that this person answered \"the only ugly thing here is your mom\" (it was a better burn in my native language).\nAlmost three years later I know this was the best decision ever.

Also I think saying you don\u2019t care about her opinion especially in this situation is one of the less rude things that siblings say to each other. I think it\u2019s great that you got that cat. It doesn\u2019t matter if an animal is ugly or not as long as you the owner have a good connection with them and are a good owner. You seem like you would be a good owner", "NTA.  Your sister insulted your cat and your parents agreed w/her.  They need to learn to that you shouldn't speak others the way your sister did.", "NTA\n\nShe could have been nice, too. But she wasn't, so she should be happy that all she got was being told off in a fairly polite way.", "Lol that\u2019s not the way life works, I would have added fuck off too.", "But, your parents taught you not to lie, right? Soooo, no problem.\n\nNTA", "NTA  \nUnsolicited opinions, aka criticism, don't require a \"nice\" response.", "NTA, your sister is being really stupid! I would have been a lot harsher with my language, I can tell you! I'd post a pic of my one eared cat, Hannibal, but I can't in this sub. He's a wonderful cat, and you made the right choice!", "NTA. The ugliest cats are the nicest things. Poor neglected fur babies.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't ask about her opinion! The cat is *yours* not *hers*.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents are AHs, and your sister is the golden child.", "LMFAO. NTA. I don\u2019t think I need to explain it.", "There is no such thing as an ugly cat. People, on the other hand, often are. Your sister and parents are pitiful.", "NTA. And since I am evil, I say it would be a fair game if you said, \"It's ugly! You should take it back.\" to your parents while pointing at your sister.", "Came here to say this. OP should have said \"Well, you're ugly and Mom and Dad kept you. I guess I'm just following the family tradition.\"\n\nNTA, OP. And I don't even like cats. (I don't hate them. I'm just not a cat person.) Seriously, who calls their sister's cat ugly?", "This made me LOL, perfect comeback!!! NTA", "Yeah Im petty and would say that: \u201coh but our parents kept you\u201d\nShe\u2019s such a yucky human being", "Mine would have been \"There's the door, you leave or I throw you out.  You can come back when ***I*** say you can.\"\n\nNTA.  But the rest of OP's family needs lessons in tact and manners.", ">technically she is a neutered male.\n\n...Is your cat trans?", "That's what we joke she is because she does not act like a male cat even a neutered one acts just like our spayed females and our other two cats don't like males neutered or intact but they like Mia.\n\n Mia also will only respond to Mia or Princess Mia it was also five months after we adopted her that we realized she was a neutered male cat combined with everything else we said she was still Mia and still a girl cat not like she cares if we use feminine pronouns instead if masculine"]}
