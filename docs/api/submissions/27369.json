A 3-4 months old kitty left on the street because she was just one of those Christmas presents parents give to their kids. I wasn't even looking to adopt so I waited a couple of days to think about it and see if she was adopted but just couldn't stop thinking about her and knew somewhere in my heart that she was going to be with me. The person that rescued her posted a second time \"Still haven't found a home for this baby\" and a huge AH wrote in the comments \"well, she is kind of ugly\". My blood was boiling, what an awful thing to say! I loved that this person answered \"the only ugly thing here is your mom\" (it was a better burn in my native language).\nAlmost three years later I know this was the best decision ever. I love my cat so much, and it has brought me so much joy. We have been through so much together (turns out she was pregnant, had to take care of the kitties too). You cannot dismiss this love based on some \"aesthetic\".", "I\u2019ve not had a cat in more than 25 years and we recently had some kittens dumped at the barn. We took them for spay/neuter and they actually *cut the ear* of the cat to show it\u2019s been spayed/neutered. It blew my mind. I get that feral cats are flighty and the cut makes it obvious at a distance they\u2019re fixed - but it\u2019s a bit barbaric. In any case OP\u2019s family would *never* adopt a shelter cat because they *all* have jacked up ears.", "Ahhh that's so sweet of her. Do you have a picture? \ud83d\ude0d", "This! Almost ready to issue my judgement based on the lack of cat tax alone /s", "If I could upvote you more than once, I would.", "And especially people who are supposed to be family... I'd go LC or even NC with people like that ... Sure some people dont like pets but to call them ugly for such a reason just shows what kind they are...\n\nDefinitely NTA OP. Thanks for taking in the adorable kitty :)", "Yeah right? We got 2 strays in our house (we're pretty sure the white girl came from a abusive home) and they are so wonderful, black boy just loves attention and the girl usually lies on the end of our bed or outside my stepsons room on the floor waiting for him (he doesn't like her being in his room for some reason).", "I am honestly not sure how she could have said this in a nicer way. She wasn't rude, she wasn't agressive. She just said her sister's opinion didn't matter in her choice of which pet to get. Very reasonable. \n\nAnd also sister was a woman speaking her mind and being very rude. This feels like sister is indulged one.", "My first cat was terrified of everyone but me. Several years into having her (six, I think) she went from vanishing if anyone outside the family was around to staying in the same room.", "This!!! Animals don't have to comply with some beauty standards or \"aesthetics\". What is wrong with people.", "Your parents too", "Oh yeah, PET TAX.", "why does the cat's appearance matter? genuine question, i don't understand how that affects anything at all. like, how does adopting a stray with a missing ear is a \"hasty decision\"? \n\nif ur saying this just because of the cat's appearance, then it is not something that this cat control \ud83e\udd28 however, the op is an adult and taking care of a cat is not that hard, so i don't see how taking in a stray is irresponsible. how is that different from deciding to take in any other animal? why would they need to consult the rest of the family if they are literally living alone? \n\nand does the cat deserve to die for missing an ear? if your answer is yes, i would examine what that is rooted in. there are lots of people and animals who are disabled/missing a limp, if you think they all deserve to die then you are basically argumenting for genocide. and if you don't think that, then you shouldn't be argumenting for a cat's death bc of the animal's appearance. would you yourself want to be treated differently if you were missing an ear?", "Oh look, the sister's on Reddit.", "Also a lot of strays are missing an ear or part of one. Just means picked up and neutered. Some then go on to be rehabbed.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I would have answered somiething along the same line as you would", "Malicious Burn, Stinging retort, Scorching rebuttal\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nOP actually gave the nice reply", "Sisters indeed! Back when i was a teen my treat at home was cooking up some fish (im a good cook), which of course smells up the kitchen. My sister and i were being catty and she turned saying something like \"if you were a native American your name would be 'Stinks Like Fish' !\" To which i turned around without missing a beat and snapped \"Yeah? Well your name would have been 'Dumb Like Rock'!\" .... a good sister story is worth its weight in gold.we still drop the names for fun as older adults.", "Never knew that we have a white cat with a clipped ear", "Exactly! Would she say that about a person with visable signs that they'd survived abuse? Her attitude and apparent belief that _scarred/disabled = ugly = undeserving of love/life_ is appalling! OP is right to ignore her ableist opinion.", "*Upvoted on your behalf!*", "Upvoted as well on your behalf xD couldn't be more right.", "There is no such thing as a stray cat, there is only cats who haven't picked a human yet. Your two prove that.", "You care more about the cat's life than the sister's opinion, seems like a perfectly reasonable set of priorities to me. \n\nNTA.", "We had a dog for a day that was too high energy and my mum couldn\u2019t run around after me and my brother (both under the age of 10) and this 6 month old Dalmatian pup (cat and dog home said he was very clam and enjoyed lazing around)\u2026I asked if we could just give them my brother instead of giving back the dog\u2026.", "Sometimes it's done after injuries from street fights, which could be the reason if you got your kitty and a youngish age\n\nIt's good to check the tips of their ears and nose periodically, if there's any 'freckles' that start getting inflamed it's best to get it treated asap before it progresses too far\n\nIf it's an indoor cat I'd definitely restrict the sunspots by closing some curtains etc (;", "I agree", "Well they came from the street, but we feed a bunch of cats that come by basically every day, some got homes and some don't, we don't care, we feed and pet them and give them snacks. That's just how much we love cats :)"]}
