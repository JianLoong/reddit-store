His family is hardcore Christian\u2019s and we aren\u2019t. My boyfriend paid $1000 for me and him to get a room on the vacation. His parents paid $1500 for the two of them and his 10 year old sister. His aunt and uncle paid $8000 for the two of them, the grandparents, their 2 kids, and their daughters best friend. In total they paid for 7 people. \n      They said we can\u2019t get our own room because they don\u2019t want us sleeping together, even thought we put money in on the house. They said they paid the most, so they make the decision. But they also paid for 7 people to come and we paid for 2 so we paid out share. \n        We are all fighting about it right now and they said it isn\u2019t fair their kids have to share a room and we get our own, but your kids also paid nothing on the vacation. We told them if we don\u2019t get our own room to give us our money back and we just won\u2019t go. Are we in the wrong ? \n       His parents are mad at him because my boyfriend gave them the cash for vacation and Originally didn\u2019t tell anyone that my boyfriend put in money, and said it was wrong of him for using the fact he put in money to be the reason he gets a room \nbecause everyone still sees him as a kid.\n       I genuinely don\u2019t think we are in the wrong because if you break down the costs, it\u2019s $875 per person, but they only asked for $1000 because we would be getting the smallest room out of all of the adults, which is just a room with a tv and a full sized bed. We also offered to give them more and they didn\u2019t want it.\n\nLET ME ALSO ADD That they let their 18 year old daughter and her boyfriend of 3 months bunk together and was even going to let them sleep together on vacation before they split.

My boyfriend said they have till tonight to make the decision and if they don\u2019t let us have a room he needs his money back ASAP. my main problem is they let their daughter share a room with her boyfriend of 3 months but me and him can\u2019t share a room after 2 years!", "I knew I wasn\u2019t crazy.

A big room with a bunk bed (for the two youngest kids) and the room we were supposed to share. The oldest daughter was going to share the room with her brother, but they thought that was unfair. Then they wanted to give the room to her and her boyfriend but that was also unfair and they ended up breaking up. Then they said we can have it. This was in February. So she invited her best friend who\u2019s sleeping on a pull out couch and so is their daughter (there\u2019s 2 queen size pull out couches.) and the aunt tried suggesting that me, the daughter, and the best friend share a bed. I\u2019m not comfortable with that because I\u2019ve met the cousin once and never met the friend. I don\u2019t feel comfortable sleeping in a bed with strangers when my boyfriend paid for us to get that room. Then they suggested I sleep on the couch and all the family including my boyfriend split the space in the beds up, but I said fuck no because the best friend would also be sleeping in one of those beds, possibly with him and I personally don\u2019t feel comfortable with my boyfriend sleeping behind closed doors with someone who isn\u2019t family.", "That makes no sense", "A tale as old as time\u2026 the person being asked to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d is seldom the one being badly behaved.", "I am in agreement, when my mother exerted a rule like that, I booked a hotel room rather than stay with them with my date.\n\nMy mother was pretty hurt, but it drove the point without a direct confrontation.", "That\u2019s what I said", "Get your money back and go on a private vacation with your bf", "NTA\u2026 go on your own vacation.. away from those clowns", ">They said they paid the most, so they make the decision.\n\n>and said it was wrong of him for using the fact he put in money to be the reason he gets a room \n\nOh the hypocrisy of \"as a parents my logic is always right and I am never wrong.\"", "Yeah Op you want r/justnomil.
