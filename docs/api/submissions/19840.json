Law school is expensive.\n\nWhatever issues there are with art programs (there's definitely better and worse choices) Diana is completely blowing that up. The promise was unreasonable to ask for and make in the first place.", "NTA, the moment I read that she is willing to pay for the other kids without your financial status changing, I knew she was the AH. \"Wah wah, my kid isn't doing what I dreamed my kids to do!\" What an awful mom...\n\nThis next part is just personal advice from me. I would encourage you to encourage your daughter to find an alternative to art school that will still allow her to express her interests. Majors that involve graphical design, website design, or even game design would allow her to express herself creatively, while still having very good job opportunities. I have a couple friends who went to art school who are not doing what they want to do and working a non-degree requiring job. Encourage her to do something in the technical field. Complete bias when I say this, but I think art school is a scam.", "NTA. You're doing the right thing for your daughter instead of sitting by and letting her mother toxicly dictate the direction of your daughter's life.

She so desperately wants to continue some asinine legacy that she effectively told your daughter she was on her own if she wanted to do anything other than become a lawyer. Law isn't for everyone, and a lot of people leave the profession or burnout during the educational part because of this. Your wife is more concerned with how she looks legacy wise than whether her kids are happy and living happy lives.

Why should she have any say on your own personal funds on top of it?", "NTA\n\nOne of my best friend's parents wanted her to be a lawyer. She didn't, but she went through law school, and even passed the bar. But she never got a law job because she interviewed like somebody who didn't want to be a a lawyer.\n\nInstead she worked as a retail buyer for years before going back to school in library science, which she enjoyed. These days she has a very good job--not lawyer money, but solid. It's just a shame that she wasted all that time and money on a law degree she never wanted.\n\nIf  your daughter doesn't want to be a lawyer, it was be just as big a waste of time and money to force her to. \n\nYou stick to your guns and support your daughter!", "So your wife is refusing you access to your daughters college fund that you contributed to 50% I\u2019m guessing\u2026 might be time to ask your wife if she knows any good lawyers. \n\nNTA your wife is a wretched mother.", "NTA and I do think this was the right thing to do but your family needs to work this out or you risk breaking up your marriage and your child cutting off your wife (or even the whole family). Forcing a teen to get into a career they aren\u2019t interested in reaps no reward for anyone. I hope you can all work this out because of what could come from this and is a college fund really worth the misery?", "NTA your wife can\u2019t force her goals and dreams on her kids.", "NTA. I'll let others address the spousal communication. I can speak to the idea that kids can be pushed into law school. \n\nMy law school had some 3Ls mentor 1Ls. One person I mentored was living the situation described. She did not want to be there at all and was only in law school because her dad insisted upon it. It took a \\*lot\\* of work to get her to be able to be productive. She definitely had the tools to be there, but had a hard time getting past her resentment, which colored her view of everything & everyone there. We eventually figured out that she could apply herself at law school as a means of placating her parents with the idea that her law degree would be more like a critical thinking degree based in the law. She was 100% certain that she would not be using her degree for more than that because the pressure to go to law school soured any positive idea she'd had before about being a lawyer. \n\nSo, I can tell you from my (second hand) experience, this doesn't end well. At the very least, it's a big hurdle in terms of actually learning. \n\nI'd put it to the lawyers in your family this way. You know how most prosecutors are just built such that they would never be a defense attorney? And how transactional attorneys most often would never be a successful trial attorney? Yeah, that concept applies more broadly to being an attorney or not. Not wanting to be a lawyer is a state that probably most people are in and that's ok. Experiencing life as a lawyer doesn't mesh with everyone's personality.\n\nYes, you can use a law degree in a bunch of ways. But almost all of those ways do not require a law degree. If she's coming from a family of lawyers, she's probably got that type of critical thinking already. \n\nLast, I got my bachelors in drama doing acting and directing. Had you asked 18 year old me, I would have had no idea what I wanted to do. When I graduated college, I still had no idea. Over a couple years working random jobs, I realized that I gravitated to looking at plays in college as building a world of consistent (or not) internal rules and seeing how they work together can show so much about that world. That is lawyering from a different perspective. So, I tried a job at a law firm and liked it. The point here is that forcing her to go will likely reduce the chance that she'll work in the law to 0% likely, whereas giving her the freedom to find what works for her will keep open the possibility that she may find that the law fits for her after all.", "NTA", "Your doing the right thing for your daughter. Your daughter is her own individual self and she gets to decide her future. Not you or your wife. And for your wife is a petty b**** for not paying for her daughter tuition fee.

Diana is the AH for not wanting to support Alice in going to law school. My mother\u2019s father would only pay for her to go to nursing school and not art school and that was clearly deeply hurtful to her. She got through nursing school except had one class to graduate and then dropped out. Waste of money. My mom found an independent art tutor and learned to paint on her own. Maybe Alice could find a job with an art degree, maybe not. But withholding the money for it, when her siblings are getting money for school, is unfair treatment and probably traumatic. If she really did have to pay her way through school when her siblings didn\u2019t that would definitely be traumatic. You did the right thing to pay for it. But you should have told your wife ahead of time. You should have said something like, \u201cit is not fair to not pay for Alice\u2019s tuition, we should pay for it from the college account.

You're doing the right thing in terms of helping her pay for school (or paying for school yourself).

Not forcing your kids to do something they don't want to do as a career is smart, there's no way they'll stick to something they're forced into and they'll resent you for it. Your wife needs to stop being so closed minded and consider her daughters feelings more than her own desires even if they're coming from a place of good intentions and experience.", "Wow, your wife is... something else.

I think part of the reason there's a struggle is that a lot of people want to be successful independent artists -- making the art they want to make and selling it that way. Those people exist and make good money, but that is a hard path that involves mostly luck and knowing people. \n\nTo have a good career and make good money you need be looking at art the way you look at technical skills like engineering or coding and matching them to commercial art careers. The obvious example is corporate/agency graphic designers, but other fields like VFX in film & video games that also require specialized training like 3D modeling or coding, or Printing Studios as illustrators or working in large format printing.

My parents paid my college tuition (but nothing else so I worked 20 hours a week). I skipped meals in grad school but was never really in danger. I always got paid internships and jobs.
