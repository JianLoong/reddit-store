Law school is expensive.\n\nWhatever issues there are with art programs (there's definitely better and worse choices) Diana is completely blowing that up.

I would encourage you to encourage your daughter to find an alternative to art school that will still allow her to express her interests. Majors that involve graphical design, website design, or even game design would allow her to express herself creatively, while still having very good job opportunities. I have a couple friends who went to art school who are not doing what they want to do and working a non-degree requiring job. Encourage her to do something in the technical field. Complete bias when I say this, but I think art school is a scam.", "NTA.

Your wife is more concerned with how she looks legacy wise than whether her kids are happy and living happy lives.

Why should she have any say on your own personal funds on top of it?", "NTA\n\nOne of my best friend's parents wanted her to be a lawyer.

It's just a shame that she wasted all that time and money on a law degree she never wanted.\n\nIf  your daughter doesn't want to be a lawyer, it was be just as big a waste of time and money to force her to. \n\nYou stick to your guns and support your daughter!", "So your wife is refusing you access to your daughters college fund that you contributed to 50% I\u2019m guessing\u2026 might be time to ask your wife if she knows any good lawyers. \n\nNTA your wife is a wretched mother.", "NTA and I do think this was the right thing to do but your family needs to work this out or you risk breaking up your marriage and your child cutting off your wife (or even the whole family). Forcing a teen to get into a career they aren\u2019t interested in reaps no reward for anyone. I hope you can all work this out because of what could come from this and is a college fund really worth the misery?", "NTA your wife can\u2019t force her goals and dreams on her kids.", "NTA. I'll let others address the spousal communication. I can speak to the idea that kids can be pushed into law school. \n\nMy law school had some 3Ls mentor 1Ls. One person I mentored was living the situation described. She did not want to be there at all and was only in law school because her dad insisted upon it. It took a \\*lot\\* of work to get her to be able to be productive. She definitely had the tools to be there, but had a hard time getting past her resentment, which colored her view of everything & everyone there. We eventually figured out that she could apply herself at law school as a means of placating her parents with the idea that her law degree would be more like a critical thinking degree based in the law. She was 100% certain that she would not be using her degree for more than that because the pressure to go to law school soured any positive idea she'd had before about being a lawyer. \n\nSo, I can tell you from my (second hand) experience, this doesn't end well. At the very least, it's a big hurdle in terms of actually learning. \n\nI'd put it to the lawyers in your family this way. You know how most prosecutors are just built such that they would never be a defense attorney? And how transactional attorneys most often would never be a successful trial attorney? Yeah, that concept applies more broadly to being an attorney or not. Not wanting to be a lawyer is a state that probably most people are in and that's ok. Experiencing life as a lawyer doesn't mesh with everyone's personality.\n\nYes, you can use a law degree in a bunch of ways. But almost all of those ways do not require a law degree. If she's coming from a family of lawyers, she's probably got that type of critical thinking already. \n\nLast, I got my bachelors in drama doing acting and directing. Had you asked 18 year old me, I would have had no idea what I wanted to do. When I graduated college, I still had no idea. Over a couple years working random jobs, I realized that I gravitated to looking at plays in college as building a world of consistent (or not) internal rules and seeing how they work together can show so much about that world. That is lawyering from a different perspective. So, I tried a job at a law firm and liked it. The point here is that forcing her to go will likely reduce the chance that she'll work in the law to 0% likely, whereas giving her the freedom to find what works for her will keep open the possibility that she may find that the law fits for her after all.", "NTA", "Your doing the right thing for your daughter. Your daughter is her own individual self and she gets to decide her future. Not you or your wife. And for your wife is a petty b**** for not paying for her daughter tuition fee.

Diana is the AH for not wanting to support Alice in going to law school. My mother\u2019s father would only pay for her to go to nursing school and not art school and that was clearly deeply hurtful to her. She got through nursing school except had one class to graduate and then dropped out. Waste of money. My mom found an independent art tutor and learned to paint on her own. Maybe Alice could find a job with an art degree, maybe not. But withholding the money for it, when her siblings are getting money for school, is unfair treatment and probably traumatic. If she really did have to pay her way through school when her siblings didn\u2019t that would definitely be traumatic. You did the right thing to pay for it. But you should have told your wife ahead of time. You should have said something like, \u201cit is not fair to not pay for Alice\u2019s tuition, we should pay for it from the college account.
