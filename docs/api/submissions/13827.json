You don't need to run these decisions by him at this stage of your renewed relationship.

My biggest issue is why a man in his 40s has no driver's license.", "NTA, though it seems like maybe this relationship isn't the right thing for either of you. Letting go can be really hard, and obviously I'm just a stranger on the internet. But talking about him seems to make you frustrated and unhappy, and he has obviously been angry for 6 months about your decision about your living situation. It might be time to go your separate ways for good.", "NTA  Eighteen months and 500km is a long enough separation in both time and distance to consider this relationship brand new.  It is unreasonable for a partner to believe that, after only 2 months of dating, he should be of more importance to you than your family, your animals, and your career.  It sounds as though he is completely unaware that your old relationship failed for valid reasons and wants to go back in time and live in THAT relationship, rather than the actual relationship that you now have.", "NTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t need his validation to do what you want to do.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nToo early for him to have a say.", "NTA.\n\nYou're still unsure about the future of the relationship, so carrying on with your life is the sensible thing to do.\n\nAs others have said, it might be that this relationship has run its course... \n\nAnd the animals need to be cared for, every day.

It seems to me like he's making it into a big issue so you'll constantly feel bad and he'd have the upper hand in your relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Put yourself first and do what *you* think is right - no matter what may happen in that relationship.", "It doesn't sound like you have any reason to make this relationship a priority. Your SO doesn't even have transportation to come spend time with you and you have obligations where you are that you are clearly not going to abandon.

It seems like the two of you have very different wants for both the present and the future. Ever if you love each other (which sounds dubious, frankly), a shared life together doesn\u2019t seem possible.", "INFO: Did you previously have arguments about him not feeling involved in the decision making? Was there an expectation that he be more involved? Where you discussing alternatives such as moving in together or has he know that you would eventually take over your mom's place? It's hard to give judgement without knowing what the expectation is around making large decisions\n\nEdit: After reading OP's other replies, going with NTA. And I agree with the others, perhaps this relationship has run it's course, especially with how controlling/demanding he sounds", "NTA. But my real advice to you is that you should immediately end your relationship with your boyfriend. Being a caregiver is demanding, and your planning for dealing with that sounds sensible. And your partner is already complaining and resentful. End things now, you'll be a lot happier for it!", "NTA. Your new relationship with him is fresh and your life choices shouldn't revolve around him.\n\n\nYour mother's health and needs here are a priority and taking over the house is the right move.\n\n\nSide note, how does a 45 year old man not know how to drive?

And that\u2019s OK.\n\nI think deep down, you are OK with it.\n\nGood luck!", "Might. I was already the one to call it quits last time. And I hoped with therapy on both side we would find our way back together.\nBut I won't go into more years of being always wrong. I mean if how I function is not okay, then he should call it quits and not pester me for months on a decision he knows I won't change.", "Thanks, I will", "Thanks", "It's not the controlling aspect of it that makes me doubt. It's how he used it to justify a lot of his actions afterwards, and how he kind of always makes me the villain. It was already the case in the previous relationship and I spent a good part of those 7 years making amends, part of them justified, part of them I felt excessive.\n\nAnd my decision and decision process seemed sound to me, but after 7 months of hearing how it was not how you should do in a relationship I'm starting to doubt myself.", "He has lived in big cities all his life and did not need it, so no biggie. Several of my friends, male and female, with the same profile, don't have their license either. \nAnd yes that was my thought process but after a few months of pestering self doubt starts", "First time around we did split because of irreconcilable needs and boundaries, not because we were out of love. And we kept in touch on the 18 months.\nI love him deeply, but in the 18 months I learned that I did not need him, as was my belief for 7 years. It was a pretty classical co-dependent situation, where I was the anxious one. I left because I thought he'd be better without me and went to therapy and a lot of self-work to admit I was at that time better without him too\nAnd yes it is my belief that love is not enough. And that we may kot be compatible despite loving each other deeply.\n\nAnd it may feel selfish or merchant-like,  but I want a partner who adds value to my life, knowing that there are difficult times to go through where it's not the case, but overall they should add. I want a supporter and someone who cheers my success. As I would do for them.", "Maybe validation was not the right term, English not being my mother tongue.\nThe idea was that I should not make life altering choices without him.\n\nFor me at this stage of the relationship it was not granted, specially since it was a pace change not a complete change.\n\nI would have discussed with him if for example I had been offered a job in another country and/or moving further from him.\n\nBut for him I should not have changed the pace and my short term situation without a shared agreement", "He did not need his license most of the time, since he has lived in capitals and big cities all his life.\n\nBut yes weaponized incompetence has been a running subject both in our previous and our current relationship\n\nAs for my best friend I'd probably say to stop the relationship. But for various reasons, linked to this and a previous relationship, I'm often doubting my own perception of situations, and like maybe for example my account t here was not truthful enough or warped in my interest.\n\nNow that money is better, I actually plan on going back in therapy to help with this\n\n(though it makes me a better manager because I hear everyone's account and POV before making any decision)", "I informed him that my mom was offering it. And he knew from the start that within 2 to 5 years I would move there and take the place over.\n\nI also explained why it made sense for me to accept : only one moving in (my stuff is still mostly in cardboard boxes) instead of at least 2. I will save money and time by furnishing directly the place where I'll stay for the next 20 years at least probably, instead of another one then this one. I can also invest in improving the place so that it's less work to care for the horses. And last but not least adapt earlier the place for my and our projects to organize retreats there.\n\nBut I did not ask if he was okay with the fact. Or the consequences such as him needing his license earlier if he wanted to move around when he came on his off time.", "To be fair he is also putting more anchors his side of the LDR. Which is fine by me. It was agreed that we wouldn't live together again before a few years, because he had goals he wanted to achieve where he lives, and I had my own obligations on my side. I'd rather have my partner closer but now it's not feasible so I agreed on trying to rekindle things despite this. \n\nI don't have issue with him not having a license, I have with him not taking steps to get one while pestering me. If he was not coming again and again at me I would not even care that currently he prioritizes several other things over getting a license. Because I understand that his current priorities are elsewhere.\n\nAnd maybe you're right maybe my actions stem from distrusting the possibility for our new relationship to work. I've expressed it but maybe I should make it clearer. Thanks for the suggestion", "We do love each other, never stopped in fact. But yes I doubt somehow that we can make it work.\n\nThe first 7 years were centered around his life choices. Now I moved in my life where I can't mold my self around this anymore.\n\nI've also got myself mostly out of my co-dependent tendency, and I know I can make it without him. Which probably makes me less tolerant/more demanding.\n\nI will always love him because he is important to me. I will also always be there for him. But I will not have him as my partner if the cost is too high.", "We had arguments about me being more of an equal int he decision process compared to the previous situation. But he always had a hard time with me taking a decision or changing a decision on something that was mostly affecting me (like starting back a sport for example)\n\nIt was said that he would in time move with me, timing depending on how his situation in his place evolved and how much he needed to be there for his job in the future, and how much of his job he could do in my area.\n\nWe had a discussion about how he would be more and more included in decisions concerning the space once our relationship was better established, he spent longer there, or when it directly concerned our projects of organizing retreats. But I also said that I would also take those decisions while making sure that if anything happened between us I would still be able to house and take care of my horses. Like I have an insurance that would provide my mom with the needed money to put them in a livery for years, or pay someone at home, should I die or be incapacitated.\n\nSo for me quickening the process without his agreement still felt something I could decide alone.", "I may have mislead you : my mom's health is good now. She just don't think she can take care of the place she currently is in anymore. So she wants to move out and for me to move in earlier than planned. It will free her time, money and energy to enjoy her retirement better. \n\nShe may also house and care for my grandma in the near future which I would help with. She will be the leader in this, and main caregiver, while I take over the horses (hers and mine) care and the house and estate maintenance. \n\nSo I don't think considering my situation as a caregiver is right, per my understanding of the word.\n\nBut yes taking responsability for the estate and the horses is a source of tension between us, and he would rather I get rid of some of the horses to reduce the load. It is a subject I told him we had to agree on. Because when he moved in I would neither take more chores to do in the house with no help outside, nor accept to be guilted because of the time it took.", "He has always lived in big cities, did not need a driving license to go around.", "If he cared he would learn to drive.", "This does not sound like a loving partner. My ex-partner lured me back into our relationship years ago. It would all be different, he said. But it wasn\u2019t. It was the same trash but just with a thin layer of silver. Once the silver wore off I saw all the trash again. I broke up with him again and never looked back. Now I am with someone who loves me and cares for me. Who actually listens to what I want.", "Leave him. If he\u2019s doing the same thing he did in the previous relationship he has not change and he will keep doing it", "Therapy is a great solution! I used to struggle with self-doubt a lot as a result of an abusive upbringing. Trust your gut, and know that you deserve to be treated well and with respect.", "My current opinion after the renewed tantrum this morning. And even if I move now he won't come for a few years to live full time, and would in the meantime come mostly for his off time.", "I think other commenters are correct. The relationship seems to have run its course. You seem to be the only one working at this relationship while he\u2019s not even doing the bare minimum. I wish you luck.", "NTA\n\nHe's been mad 6/7 MONTHS? It might be time to close the books on this relationship for good. Sounds to me you're making life decisions you're happy with. Keep living your best life...which might not include him.\n\nSeriously, 7 MONTHS?", "So you chose your animals, and decided to end your relationship for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA NOT for doing it, but for the way you did it.", "NTA. Take care of your Mom, move on from your \u201cpartner\u201d and enjoy your life. I bet you would feel a lot of stress gone with him.", " NTA \n\nYour doing the right thing. The boyfriend however needs to be replaced after reading your comments.", "NTA sounds like hes scrambling to try and get control over you, rather than working to renew your relationship, by saying you need to get his approval. It really sounds like you have out grown and moved past him now, so he sees that and is making demands over you, to try and get the reins back in his grip.", "YTA.  You have been together for almost 8-years.  While he doesn\u2019t have a veto over what you chose to do, you should have at least mentioned this to him before it happened.\n\nSince you couldn\u2019t bother to mention it before hand, you have show you don\u2019t care about what he has to say on the issue.  Since you care so little for him, you should split up.", "Well you've made it pretty clear to him that the relationship if over, so I hope that was the message you wanted to send.", "NTA it's done, move on.", "> weaponized incompetence to me\n\nThis is not weaponized incompetence. A large amount of people live within cities that actually have public transport, and as such cannot either afford a car nor need one.\n\nIf he were insisting that he could not learn to drive, or intentionally doing poor while practicing, you'd have a point, but that isn't the case. He's just being selfish.", "Look, NTA, but I don't understand why you are in this relationship? It doesn't sound like you either trust or particularly want this person, as you aren't interested in compromising at all to be with him. If I understand correctly, your position is, I live in this house, we either have a LDR permanently or you move here and make lifestyle changes, like a driver's license? Fine, but why are you putting up with months-long arguments about it? Tell him point blank that's the situation and he can accept it with good grace or break up. Or maybe just break up.", "I don\u2019t know, with the limited information we have here, if he is controlling or not. He certainly sounds manipulative to me, but maybe I\u2019m wrong. \n\nThere is a book called Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft - it\u2019s been linked on Reddit as a free PDF, if you search for it. I recommend starting there, and if you find yourself relating it to your relationship, it\u2019s a pretty clear indicator that you should end it.\n\nGood luck to you!", "Maybe it's time to make a list of the reasons being WITH him actually has a positive effect on your life. From the info and your replies, I'm thinking the list might be small", "I feel like you should be able to make decisions for yourself. He seems mad that you are making decisions for yourself as an adult woman. I don't think he's worth your time. It sounds like he needs to have the upperhand in the relationship."]}
