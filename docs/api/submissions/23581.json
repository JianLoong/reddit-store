I would suggest not posting any information about when or where the funeral service is being held, and just personally invite the people who you want to be there. You should also let the funeral home know that the information is to be kept private, just in case someone tries to call and figure out when the funeral is.     \n\nPlanning funeral services for someone you loved is hard enough, and you and your siblings don't need to deal with the abusive family members. I wish you all peace during this difficult time.", "NTA.  Keep the NC going in honor of your mother who protected you although hers did not.", "NTA do not respond to any of the attempts, block every person who attempts to contact you, preferably without reading them, this is easier than having the conversation or feeling guilty.\n\nif your mum was NC in life , I imagine that would be her wish in death.\n\nmy condolences to you and your siblings", "Before this post gets shut down for mentioning CSA, I just want to tell you that you're NTA.

It's not the funeral home's first time at the rodeo of keeping out undesirables from a service.", "Funeral information is only public if you make it public. You can post an obituary without any information about when or where services are being held. You don't even have to post an obituary until after the funeral. Idk where OP is located, but every funeral home I know of doesn't post anything without the family's permission.", "you can absolutely prohibit them from coming.  This is a PRIVATE event, not a public one.", "I was wondering if you could do that. Do it and remain NC.", "Also, if an obituary is published make sure you don't include any info about services.", "NTA. You are top priority. You are the one who is still behind and your mother's wishes matter, but because you don't know what they are you need to do what is best for you. I think if you want them there you should invite them, and if they will worsen your heartache then you have every right to ignore them and keep them away.", "YWNBTA", "NTA.  You do what is best for your mental and emotional health.  Your mom cut them off and out of her life.  The way I see it is this, if they are not there for you when you were alive, they do not need to see you off in death.", "NTA If ur mother didn\u2019t want them around in life she wouldn\u2019t want them the free her death I say stay no contact if u have to hire security for the funeral give ur mother a wonderful funeral with the people she LOVED there and say goodbye, that would be a good way to respect her if she didn\u2019t want to see them and u don\u2019t want to see them they have no right to be there! They have been out of her life for years the only reason I can think of they\u2019d wanna come back now is to try to get something out of it may it be money, property, valuables, sympathy something. \nAlso I\u2019m so sry for ur loss I lost a parent and it was very sudden as well and it\u2019s a whole different level of hurt sending hugs", "NTA.\n\nIn the absence of clear instructions from your mother regarding her family, you are free to make your best educated guess. And your best educated guess is that she would not want to subject her beloved daughter to the pain and stress of dealing with her mother\u2019s cruel, dysfunctional family while she grieves. A guess that is well-supported by years of evidence. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Please protect your peace, and honor your mother\u2019s memory however you see fit. Her family forfeited their right to be indignant about being excluded when they decided to turn a blind eye to child abuse.", "NTA - so sorry for your loss. You Mom was a strong person, going NC to protect herself and you from a terrible bunch of criminals. Continue to follow the wise path she has set.", "NTA. Your mother had good reasons for going NC.

You have no clue now so I would give her family as little information as possible other than possibly, 'yes she has passed away' and not offer anything additional.  She went NC for a reason, stay with it.  NTAH.", "Agreed! My mom passed almost two years ago, she had maybe two or three cousins she kept in contact with after a massive stroke 20+ years ago because they were the only ones who didn't use her for money (obviously couldnt have a job being severely disabled the way she was), the only one still alive when my mom passed was called and notified of her passing and we didn't try to contact any of her remaining relatives because they couldn't be bothered to give a shit about her when she was alive. The people who needed to know were informed, that was that.", "Of course she can prevent them from going.

My siblings want nothing to do with them either", "I don\u2019t use Reddit much, didn\u2019t realize mentioning that would get this shut down although it makes sense. Thank you for your kindness", "Depends whether the mods notice, since it's not worded in an obvious way.  Just wanted to comment early in case.", "Nta", "NTA. I've been in a similar situation but was too out of my head to be aware enough to tell people to go away, I was NC before the funeral and am NC now. NOTHING but headache and more pain came from those people being around. They don't need to come to the funeral to grieve a woman they shit on when she was alive. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA I'm really sorry for your loss \n\nIts reasonable to continue with her trend of no contact. \n\nI cut off most of my family years ago and I can tell you that if I died tomorrow I'd probably be in whatever afterlife there is cursing out whoever invited them. \n\nIf they cant respect her in life they wont respect her in death and thus dont have any right to be at any kind of funeral/memorial service/celebration of life", "I regret allowing the family that my father was no contact with to his funeral \n\nHis girlfriend also regrets it\n\nIt was also a sudden death, \u201canything you need at all, we are always here\u201d acting all devastated \u2026 I haven\u2019t heard a peep from any of them since we left the crematorium", "Agreed- and might I add that everyone is focusing on mom's wishes, which is great and all because she sounds like a stand-up human being, but funerals are really for the living aren't they? Op's mom lived her life protecting her daughter, so whatever her daughter wants is 100% the way to go. Op owes those people nothing, and should not feel even the tiniest scintilla of guilt about it.", "NTA. Your mom would want you to live your best life. If you want to reach out the family, then do so. If you want to maintain your distance, then do so. All your mom would want is for you to be eyes wide open in any dealings with that family.", "NTA. Respect your mother. They never did. What a huge betrayal ALL of them committed against her.", "NTA, not at all \n\nI guess I mean NTAAA\ud83d\ude1c", "Nta if your mom wanted them around at all they would be. She hasn\u2019t needed in a long time so why bring them in now. If you want them to know but not actually be there. I would be petty and send them the information a day or two before the actual service that way by the time they get it it will be the day after. That way they get notified of what happens but won\u2019t actually be able to attend the service.", "You would NOT be the asshole. What kind of people think sexual abuse is nbd? Stay away from those horrible people and never look back. You don\u2019t owe them anything!!!", "NTA. \n\nYou know what your mother would have wanted. You know it would be triggering to you. Leave everything else out of it. What her family wants is of no importance.", "NTA.\n\nIf they weren't going to be there for her in life, then they don't deserve to be there for her death. I get the feeling they just want the attention attending her funeral would bring.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, OP.", "NTA.  Stay NC. Let em find out via tertiary channels afterbthe fact.", "You honestly think your mother would want you to put yourself through seeing those people again? There is not a snowball's chance in hell she would want to appease them at such a cost to you. Let her protect you now like she did before, honour her legacy. NTA", "I feel like, she made her choice in life, going NC. If you now have them show up, it would be going against her living wishes.\n\nAlso, I have to wonder, why exactly is anyone contacting you at all? There's been silence this whole time, so why? I don't know your family obviously, but in another situation, this feels like someone might want something (an item, money, thinking they would somehow be in the will, etc). It might not be, it could just be that her death was a wake up call for some.\n\nWhat does the rest of the family you actually speak to, and who your mother spoke to, think of this?"]}
