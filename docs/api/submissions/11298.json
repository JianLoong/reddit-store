My head was dizzy and I could hear my sister screaming and my dad was shouting something. I could also hear my mom laughing. I woke up in the hospital and heard my moms older sister screaming and asking why she was laughing. My mom came back with crocodile ears claiming that she thought it wasn't that bad and that she didn't see everything and because of that she didn't know how bad it was. My aunt told my mom to leave. Dad, my sister and my aunt were around me in the hospital room keeping me company during visiting hours. My mom did try coming back but I told the doctor that I didn't want her anywhere near me.

You say she's a good mum apart from that so its worth working through things.", "Assuming your mom doesn\u2019t have a mental disorder that prevents emotional regulation, NTA at all. \n\nIf you were knocked out that long it was likely a concussion which can be serious. That sounds incredibly scary what happened and I\u2019m sure you were in pain after. \n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine laughing at my kids (or anyone else) that were injured.  And even if in the moment maybe she thought it wasn\u2019t that bad or had her nerves take over and prevent her from reacting properly, it sounds like this went on for an extended time if she was still laughing after you were unconscious AND at the hospital.  \n\nSo you are definitely NTA and your mom definitely is.  I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you and your mom acted that way.", "Honestly, ESH. Your mom is definitely sucks for laughing. Whether it's because she didn't see the whole thing and didn't realize it was more serious than it appeared, I'm not sure. Personally, I laugh as a nervous reaction. I have found myself laughing in very inappropriate situations. It's not that I didn't grasp the seriousness of the situation, or wasn't scared, it's an unconscious reaction for some people. It's a possibility I think. Either way, she sucks for laughing.\n\nBut the whole family ostrizing her for her immediate reaction (which took place probably in the first 5 seconds of the injury and is something that comes impulsively and unconsciously for most people) is kind of....an overreaction for sure. \n\n>According to my mom, through my aunt, she is \"suffering with guilt\" and it's \"more painful for her\" than it is for me.\n\n>Outside of the laughing my mom is a good mom who spoils us\n\nBecause she feels so awful I'm inclined to think she didn't mean to laugh for either of the reasons I listed above. From the info given in the post, I highly doubt she laughed because she found enjoyment from your pain and suffering", "NTA.  You're more than old enough to establish boundaries with your parents and this sounds like one that needs to be in place for your mental health.\n\nYou say she's a good mom in all other ways, so clearly she loves you.  Maybe this will be the wake up call she needs that you've been hurt by this behavior.  Loving parents don't intentionally hurt their kids and I doubt she's doing it spitefully.\n\nThere could be a lot of reasons behind the laughter.  Some people use it as a coping mechanism for fear/discomfort.  Some carry things done to them in their youth forward to adulthood because it reads as normal to them.  Some parents laugh with very young children to dispel the child's fear and the behavior becomes habit.  And so many other reasons.\n\nYour mom's not a villain but you're NTA.", "I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve never done the same - laugh at the physical comedy only to suddenly feel embarrassed because it did cause injury.

Steve Martin, Martin Short, and\u2026.. you get the point I hope.\n\nMom laughed, and apologized when she knew it wasn\u2019t just a funny slip up.

You set a boundary and people thankfully listened to you.  Your mother is a monster for laughing at your pain.  It would be one thing if you had gotten up and started laughing too, but you were knocked out cold and she laughed at you.  She only started crying those tears because she's supposed to be playing the part of a worried mother.", "NTA\n\nHowever, I do wonder if your mother\u2019s reaction was due to nervousness rather than maliciousness. Sometimes people react to distress in unusual ways, and laughter is one of them. (I think it has to do with self-soothing and/or uncertainty about how to handle the situation). I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what was happening with your mother, but because you\u2019ve said she\u2019s a good mom the rest of the time, it would probably be worth it to see if that\u2019s what was going on!

OP is very lucky that they didn't sustain a concussion, but that doesn't negate the severity of the accident.  Broken bones aren't the only way to gauge if an injury is serious.

I probably shouldn't have judged mom but I wasn't even sure if the cries were real or not.", "I'm a psychologist. I'm certainly not dismissing the distress you feel about this. It's really upsetting, if someone seems to laugh about your pain (especially a loved one). It's entirely valid, to feel upset about that.\n\nHowever, if it helps, I don't think your mother ENJOYS seeing you in pain. Instead, there is a small percentage of people who have this quirk - they automatically laugh, at inappropriate times. It's well-known in psychology. They are the people who laugh at funerals, for example. Your mother MAY be one of those people. \n\nIt's NOT that they are enjoying other people's suffering. Instead, laughter is a stress-reliever built into human brains. Laughter helps relieve emotional pain and anxiety, by releasing endorphins. So if something is stressful for these particular people, their brains can just trigger laughter (as a defence against stress). It stops them feeling the worry on the same level. \n\nAnd seeing a child injured, IS stressful to most parents. But it can come across very wrong, of course, and upset people. However, what do YOU want (not just your Aunt and Dad)? Do you want to cut off your mother over it? \n\nIf you do, that's your choice. However, if she's otherwise a good mother, you may have the option of trying to fix it (if you want to). She probably doesn't understand herself, why she laughs - or how much it upsets people. \n\nIf you want to try to resolve it, then you are in your rights to insist on a long talk about it (and how it feels like she doesn't have empathy, when you're in pain). If she is really interested in trying to understand, you might be able to sort it out with her. And she will need to learn to work out this laughter habit, so she doesn't keep making you feel uncared for.", "Right! In a different comment, I had mentioned that too.

For an example one summer my brother was helping put in a dock at my family\u2019s cabin and he fell in the river. My first thought was making sure he hadn\u2019t hit his head because it was shallow and there were rocks as well as various metal poles for keeping said dock in place. One he was on dry land and I had confirmed he hadn\u2019t hit his head I immediately started laughing because he was dripping wet but only after I knew he was okay.", "NTA but you should stay off screens as much as you can while recovering from a head injury, it can make recovery time last longer.", "NTA. \n\nI was going to lean N-A-H at the very beginning, simply because some people laugh when they're nervous because they don't know what else to do, and it's not intentional. I don't know if your mom is that type. But two things make her TA here for me. 1) Even if she didn't mean it, once you tell her that you were upset with it, she needs to take full responsibility and apologize and make it right. 2) \"it's more painful for her\" than you is just straight up manipulative. That catapulted it into AH territory for me. \n\nHope you have a swift recovery, and for the love of god, wear a helmet next time. Brains are important.", "Gentle ESH.\nLaughing is a stress response, and if she's being honest, it likely stopped as soon as she realized it was actually a big deal. You said that outside of this she's a good mom. You said she apologized, although you doubt the sincerity. \n\nLike it or not, a lot of televisions have programmed getting hurt into comedy. Obviously you feel betrayed, but she clearly needs a therapist to help her grasp why that is. \n\nThe reason for the ESH is because she's trying to contact you. To me, this reads that she wants to fix the damage her reaction caused and wants to be sure you're cared for, and you're refusing to allow that. Parents do worry about their children.  I'd suggest you think about what you'd like to achieve,  and come up with a list of boundaries.  She's a lousy mom for laughing at you, but a good mom otherwise,  in your words. So tell her what you need to feel safe with her again.", "Unfortunately, depending on where OP hit, the helmet may not have covered. But I agree, invest in a really good helmet. Good luck with your recovery.", "I was thinking this - when my partner gets upset with me sometimes I laugh. I did the same thing as a child when my parents yelled at me. I know it's inappropriate, and it's not because I'm in any way entertained or having fun; I'm actually extremely stressed out when this happens.  \nAt the same time, I had a friend who was a huge asshole and laughed when I fell down the stairs and injured myself, because she thought it was funny. The other person's explanation/apology is really important.", "She is an affectionate mother but she has never shown empathy before which is weird. It's not a scared reaction because even after the times that we got hurt she would shrug her reaction as a pose to saying that she panicked", "Yh, I agree I thought I was cool but after I realised that safety comes first. As someone who has never gone through anything as bad as this, I thought that I would be fine without the helmet.", "Tell her if she wants to see you again, she needs therapy, to figurer out why she thinks it is funny that her children gets hurt", "I thought I was cool and chose not to wear a helmet", ">NoSurprise82 \u00b7 2 hr. agoAsshole Enthusiast \\[5\\]  \n>  \n>I'm a psychologist. I'm certainly not dismissing the distress you feel about this. It's really upsetting, if someone seems to laugh about your pain (especially a loved one). It's entirely valid, to feel upset about that.However, if it helps, I don't think your mother ENJOYS seeing you in pain. Instead, there is a small percentage of people who have this quirk - they automatically laugh, at inappropriate times. It's well-known in psychology. They are the people who laugh at funerals, for example. Your mother MAY be one of those people.It's NOT that they are enjoying other people's suffering. Instead, laughter is a stress-reliever built into human brains. Laughter helps relieve emotional pain and anxiety, by releasing endorphins. So if something is stressful for these particular people, their brains can just trigger laughter (as a defence against stress). It stops them feeling the worry on the same level.And seeing a child injured, IS stressful to most parents. But it can come across very wrong, of course, and upset people. However, what do YOU want (not just your Aunt and Dad)? Do you want to cut off your mother over it?If you do, that's your choice. However, if she's otherwise a good mother, you may have the option of trying to fix it (if you want to). She probably doesn't understand herself, why she laughs - or how much it upsets people.If you want to try to resolve it, then you are in your rights to insist on a long talk about it (and how it feels like she doesn't have empathy, when you're in pain). If she is really interested in trying to understand, you might be able to sort it out with her. And she will need to learn to work out this laughter habit, so she doesn't keep making you feel uncared for.\n\nThis was the comment I was looking for especially since you've mentioned that your Mom have done this type of thing before.  I agree that with NoSurprise82 that it **may not be that your Mom does not have empathy** but a psychological disorder.", "Bummer.", "6 months rest isn\u2019t good advice. You have to get your heart rate up regularly after an initial period of rest. It depends on how many concussions the person has had and what their recovery path is looking like. Any blanket concussion advice isn\u2019t good advice actually. \nSource: currently recovering from my 4th concussion. I\u2019m on month 4 and seeing a physical therapist weekly, who\u2019s directing me to get good cardio exercise daily.", "Apparently they're finding a link between football (ie, soccer) players doing headballs repeatedly, and early onset Alzheimer's.", "Hey, I'm someone who's had concussions in the past. I don't want to freak you out, but your doctor is wrong about there not being long term effects. Personally, I have olfactory hallucinations (smell things that aren't there), some funky shit going on with my blood pressure and migraines, but concussions also open you up to an increased risk of depression and other mood disorders. There isn't nearly enough research done on concussions, and a lot of doctors aren't up to date on what has been researched as the medical community has only started taking concussion seriously in the last 10 years or so", "But you don't do that to your children.", "Thank you for posting this.  I have laughed once in a stressful and emergency situations and was completely horrified with the reaction--I didn't think it was funny at all.  It was a weird reaction.  Of course I felt like a monster, but I was actually really frightened.  Terrified.  Thanks you for explanation.  \n\nNTA.  It is confusing why your mom laughs in these situations.  She has apologized, and may need to look to counseling to correct this behavior.", "This was the reply I was looking for.", "I have that.  Not when my kids get hurt, but bringing up a painful memory sometimes makes me laugh.  But the mom said she didn\u2019t think it was that serious and that\u2019s why she laughed.  She had to know her kid was, at the very least, scared after a fall like that.  I hope you\u2019re right and the mom isn\u2019t some mentally mean person.", "I was thinking this as well. I laughed at my mom\u2019s and FIL\u2019s funerals. Like while their coffins  were being lowered into the ground. I\u2019m still in pain from my mom\u2019s death 18 years later. Please OP should speak with their mother and suggest mental health care."]}
