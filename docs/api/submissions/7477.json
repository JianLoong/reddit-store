I tell him to rejoin, wait and email the recruiter.  \n\nHe's missed the interview by turning up 5 minutes late, messages me along the lines of I've been sitting in my inbox waiting to be sent the meeting link, is this how every teams meeting works - why didn't you tell me, didn't think he should have needed to be looking in the email sent a week ago for the link, he was expecting an email with the link, I should have showed him how to join, made sure he got into the interview etc. He then sends me a screenshot of the email asking me to \"explain where it says in this email i should be waiting in the meeting at 9.20\",(its a standard teams meeting email with some additional info at the bottom), I point out the \"click here to join this meeting\" link at the top of the email, and the other text re. how to join this email.\n\nWhich then of course starts a fight, with me believing this isn't my responsibility, he's an adult, if he read the email he would have seen how to join, he admits he didn't read the email properly but I should have asked him earlier in the day whether he was ready etc. (i still dont know how this would have changed anything because if he said he was waiting for the link to be emailed to him I would have assumed he was told by the recruiter the link was going to be emailed to him right before the interview) and basically I didn't act \"with any love or care\", its my fault he missed out on this job, I've done 1000 teams meetings so its all on me and its his first time so I should have been there making sure he was in it. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1673868345, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dc6fl/aita_for_my_bf_missing_his_interview/", "score": 454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sucked but it wasn't your fault and honestly pushing blame onto others is not the best employee trait.", "Please do not marry him NEVER, this is kind of person is hell, they will always blame you, like always even the most stupid thing or smallest, believe me I live with one of them and they always find a way to not take the responsability.\nNTA", "NTA He is supposedly an adult and knows how to use his voice. If he didn\u2019t know what he was doing he should have asked. This is all in him. He needs to put his big boy pants on. He can try explaining to the HR rep he didn\u2019t fully understand how the meeting process worked, but now does, can we try again. Or he can chalk it up to lesson learned and move on. He does not have the right to be mad at you for his failures.", "NTA, but possibly his caretaker? Like wtf dude.", "NTA. Holy hell the incompetence. I can only imagine there is no way he would have landed this job if he can't even read an email and figure out something this simple. Is he like this about everything in life? Your professional skills/knowledge in no way owe him this level (or any) hand holding beyond your initial help.", "nta", "NTA - online meetings is such a basic skill, he demonstrated that he couldn't read the e-mail or join the meeting on time. \n\nWill he continue to blame you fo his failures in life or take the hit himself?  Do you get credit for his successes?", "Nta. Do you also need to tell him he need to remove pants before he poos? Or that he needs to open his mouth to put food in?", "I'm exhausted just reading that. NTA", "NTA - Do not marry this man", "NTA.  You did enough and it's not your place to hold his hand all the way through the process.  He's grown and supposedly can read.  Next time maybe he'll bother to \"read it right\".", "NTA maybe you should consider if you want to have a partner or a child he sure sounds like a child", "NTA, but is this how you want to spend your life, getting blamed for not guessing in advance that your bf will screw up?", "NTA. His interview his responsibility.", "NTA. Does he expect you to do his job for him too?", "NTA - He didn't read the email properly and is putting full responsibility onto you to do his job.  I'm a little old school with tech and had no idea how to operate Teams and Zoom for college meetings.  I scheduled an appointment with IT and asked them to thoroughly walk me through it and they were great at explaining links the tech behind it exc.  He can watch You Tube tutorials on how to operate Tech because unfortunately now after covid a lot of companies are sticking by remote interviews because it's easier.  You have to adapt or get left behind.", "What would he have done alone? Maybe read the mail? And gf already told him everything but he didn't listen. Link? What link? Mail what mail? Reading? Heh? And he messed this whole shit up but it should be your fault? He is an adult! And if he can't even read the mail and find the link, i don't think he will have problems in the job anyway - or will he ask his future boss if he can bring OP to work? \n\nNTA", "This. OP, I've been married for 12+ years. If my husband or I are confused about something, we bring the person over and see if they understood things the same way we do. When my husband lost his job, we practiced interviews. But, mostly, we act like  adults. If something is important, we treat it like it's important.", "I am continually disheartened by the number of people who do not read an entire email, then have the nerve to complain when, surprise, everything is done exactly as the email said. Full disclosure, I have been guilty of this myself on occasion, but have the grace to admit it and apologize. Definitely would not take the risk on something as important as an interview! I'd have read that one through at least twice, especially if I was going to be using a new-to-me technology.", "Upset? Sure. \nBlaming her? Bullshit. \n\nAs of the end of the post he still hadn\u2019t responsibility. It\u2019s weird that he\u2019d blame her at all and kind of fucked that he\u2019d double down on it.", "Already tried this battle I wouldn\u2019t suggest it you\u2019ll lose your mind", "NTA at all. Wow.", "NTA, he is an adult. He didn't research the job and couldn't be bothered to actually read the email he was sent in advance.   He's a great job candidate. NOT!!!", "NTA\n\nIt's not your job to assume he didn't read the instructions.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think he would have got the job anyway", "No, you're NTA, and you're also not his mother.\n\nIf he can't read an email and follow instructions then he's not qualified for the job. End of.\n\nWhen my SO had to teach via Zoom we both installed it and did a trial room so they would know what to do. We made it work by talking to each other and co-operating, not by expecting the other person to do all the work then complaining when they didn't.\n\nAnd ffs, he sent you out of the room when it was time for his interview, how the heck could you know he wanted you to help? This is all on him.", "NTA sorry stopped reading. This is a whole grown adult you are dating? Imagine trying so little to get a job, Bro weeded himself out of the hiring.\nI'm assuming either he has some good points or is fantastic in the sack?", "NTA and I hate to say it but if he can\u2019t figure out how a team meetings works and needs to have his hand held\u2026 he\u2019s probably not qualified for the job. \n\nYou mention he\u2019s 26, I assume OP is near the same age and if so, OP, there\u2019s still time to exchange the boyfriend for an upgrade?", "NTA- I had to do my first Zoom interview a few months ago and knew nothing about it. I googled it and read every detail in the email the employer sent. Everything went fine. Well except at the end I wasn't sure how to hang up, but I touched the screen and there was leave meeting button in red. \n\nPerhaps you could have coached him further but he also could have let you know he wasn't clear on everything.", "INFO: OP do you also wipe his ass after he does a poo\n\nEdit- I mean this not (as much) as criticism of OP as of the \u201chelpless\u201d bf who doubled down by blaming OP. I guess I should\u2019ve said:\n\nINFO: OP does he *expect* you to wipe his ass after he does a poo, and then throw a tantrum because he sat in there for 12 hours waiting for you // you didn\u2019t use the kind of TP he likes", "NTA, this is total garbage. He didn\u2019t read the email properly or prepare properly, which tells me he was likely going to bomb the interview anyway. \n\nRegardless, at 26 he\u2019s old enough to get himself to an interview without you mothering him.", "NTA, I was in a similar situation with my husband in the middle of lockdowns.  Thankfully my husband has progressed from having the communication skills of a toddler and asked me to show him how to explain it fully a couple of days before his interview.", "NTA. His interview and getting into it was all on him. If he needed help, it was his responsibility to ASK for the help he needed. That's part of job task ownership, which is part of fulfilling a job. Sounds like he wouldn't have been qualified for the job, based on his this first test. \n\nP.S. I think you need to interview new bfs.", "NTA \nNot your job", "I think that if he has this much trouble with the interview, a remote job probably isn\u2019t for him", "NTA but why are you babying a 26 year old man. Literally teenagers that lived through the pandemic who are 10 years younger than him can join online meetings for school and are more capable than him. Also guessing by his behaviour, this isn't the first time that he's blamed you for something he's done wrong. He sounds toxic and useless.", "NTA. not your fault or responsibility for him not reading and understanding the email for him to get to and participate in his teams interview. Your bf is not an adult. He is a child. children depend on other people to get them through the day and/or important events. You are not his mother or his assistant. I hope he isn\u2019t this way in other aspects of his life. If he is that\u2019s a major red flag.", "NTA. \n\n\n\nHow often is he normally never wrong for anything else in his life? \n\n\nHe is an adult. It's not your responsibility to ensure his hand is held through life.", "NTA.\n\nDo you have to instruct him on dishes, laundry, general life activities? If he didn't know how to use Teams he could watch a YouTube tutorial, and more importantly read all correspondence from the potential workplace. It's his responsibility to learn new things not yours OP. He showed the potential employer he is unable to problem solve, learn skills related to the job and be on time. This was the easiest interview they did for the position.", "NTA. BF needs basic IT training. He didn\u2019t ask so he shouldn\u2019t be blaming you.", "He may have been a clown !"]}
