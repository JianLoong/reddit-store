All your husband does is work a 9-5 like you do. Then you come home and do the cooking and childcare while your husband is tired from working (just like you are). Your sister observes how you do most of the household tasks and sees the imbalance of it. Considering you\u2019re both doing it 50/50, he should be cooking and doing childcare as well. Since hes not, hes a golddigger since hes getting free labor from a cook and nanny (you) just like your sister is a golddigger from getting free labour as well. Looks like youre a hypocrite", "You sound jealous. I get it your sister lives a live\nWhere she get everything. She doesn\u2019t work. She has help. Heck I don\u2019t know your sister and I am jealous.\n\nThe fact is she was taking up for you. Was it her place? Nope but I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t agree with her.\n\nFirst off your younger son could use the game room as a bedroom giving the boy more room to play in the 4 year olds room.  Or even making the room a play room. I can only imagine how much stuff is cramped into the kids room. It isn\u2019t right he has a whole ass room to game.  And also if he is to tired to help with the kids then he don\u2019t need to be gaming. He needs to get his priorities straight and welcome to parent hood! \n\nSecond. I don\u2019t care if he does work 10 hours. Taking the time to game away from helping with the kids is wrong. He could play with them. He could do bedtime routine. Anything really would be a big help. \n\nI was a Sahm for 30 years. My husband worked 10-14 hour a day. But he still made time to help with the kids. He still helped me. \n\nThe difference in you working and him. In 10 hours he comes home and flops in his game room. You on the other hand have laundry, cooking, cleaning, bed times.  You have 2 full time jobs. The one you work and the kids and house. It would help tremendously if he take on the kid, do dishes, or cook. \n\nInstead of being so jealous you can\u2019t see straight. Take a look around your life. Your sister wasn\u2019t judging you. She was judging your husband. He may be home every night but he is still absent from you and the kids. And that\u2019s not right.", ">she has the nerve to say Im JEALOUS of her\n\nYou did come off as sort of proud to be struggling together with your husband.\n\n>I told her that her job is being a gold digger even if she does donate money its not HERS since she didnt make it.\n\nThat\u2019s real.\n\n>She started playing the victim crying\n\nYou sort of illicit that response when you say the things you said.\n\nYTA considering that you\u2019re trying to present this story like you\u2019re so above it all, but clearly not above it enough to request our opinions.", ">She lives hours away and recently was in town for a charity event and was staying with me for a week.\n\nFinding it hard to believe she would choose to stay with you, her sister she isn't close to at all, when she could obviously be in a luxury hotel.\n\nBut I'll play along I guess. ESH. Neither of you has any understanding or respect for the other's lifestyle, and you both resorted to nasty personal attacks.", "Geez ESH\n\nYour sister should not be spending her entire stay with you being disrespectful and pointing out all of the problems she sees and it's fair of you to be upset about that. You suck here because your response was entirely uncalled for. Obviously her husband doesn't mind being the main breadwinner for their household and that works for him and while it may not give her an income of her own charity work is both REAL and IMPORTANT work. \n\nThat being said she had a point. The way you word your post indicates that you don't dispute that while you and your husband both work you end up doing the majority of the childcare and housework. Working 10 hour shifts is no excuse to come home and not spend any time with your children and family or help out around the house as best you can.", "YTA\n\n She had a point about your husband not spending time with his kids. Also about the boys sharing a room, while he has a game room. If he has time for games, he has time to be a father too. Your husband seems useless in the household. \n\n Why are you so judgemental against her for being rich?? Why does it bother you so much that she has a nanny and a cook?? I mean, i get it, your husband is useless and you probably are burnt out, but honey, that's not your sister's fault. In fact she seemed to actually stand up for you.", "This post tells very strongly of jealousy. Your husband should be doing his fair share of the chores and looking after the kids. Being a dad doesn't mean coming home after a day of work to disappear into the game room. Your sister is right and your bitterness about her life is distracting you from what's important. I really don't understand how she's a gold digger and you've supplied nothing to suggest she is. YTA", "ESH\n\nI don't think your sister should have acted like that since she is a guest in your home. But you shouldn't have called her a gold digger either since you used it to insult her which is also not fair towards her.", "Didn\u2019t read past the 2nd paragraph. It\u2019s very sad that your children share a room when there\u2019s enough space for them to have their own. Parents should want better for their children than themselves, having a game room is a selfish choice. YTA", "YTA. Having a wealthy husband does not make you a gold digger and that comment was uncalled for. You are clearly jealous. \n\nI understand your point about the bedrooms, though. My kids (4&7) share a room. They love sharing a room. In fact, they have two beds, but choose to sleep in the same one. \n\nShe shouldn't have come at you guys the way she did, but your response was out of line.", "If you work and do everything else because you're a mother, what does he get's to do being a father? It doesn't make sense, like:\n\nI work but I'm also a mother, I do EVERYTHING. He works and is also a father, he does 0.\n\nYTA. This is not about defending her, op, it's about defending yourself.

Your sister sounds just lovely :/  It's likely your description that gives off the entitled vibes, but if she really said what you say she said while being a guest in your house, then she's rude and judgmental.\n\nHowever, you went way overboard with your reaction, so you're both wrong. \n\nInfo: Why didn't she stay at a hotel if she has so much money?? Seems this all could have been avoided if she had...", "E-S- H\n\nHer for being a snitty, judgmental,  snobby, nouveau riche social climber who has confused unearned wealth with moral superiority.\n\nYou for judging her for marrying into the lifestyle she wanted and calling her a gold digger when she's clearly a snitty, judgmental,  snobby, nouveau riche social climber. The primary difference being that gold diggers are typically eager to spend their spouse's money showing off by taking friends & poorer relatives out for fancy meals and giving them over the top gifts they can't possibly reciprocate while social climbers brag insufferably about their lifestyle and charitable contributions, generally acting as if money has put them above those who have less of it and as though not being wealthy is a moral failing. \n\nExample- if you're struggling,  a gold digger will give you a personalized Coach bag that you can't even sell instead of quietly \"losing\" a hundred bucks in your car or slipping a generous gift card into your birthday card. \n\nA social climber will tell you why it's your fault & regale you with the hardships faced by those who benefit from whatever charity the climber is currently supporting. \n\nBoth are pretty dreadful but gold diggers are more fun \ud83e\udd23\n\nJust kidding- you're totally NTA but she IS a crass social climber. (I am assuming that you wouldn't care about her having married so advantageously if she wasn't such an intolerable snob about it)", "NTA It seems your sister forgot where she came from because her nose is stuck in high altitude. She had it coming.", "The truth here lies somewhere between ESH and NTA. However, I think the sister is more in the wrong, so that swings my judgement to ultimately be NTA.\n\nThe sister has a point that OP seems to be jealous of her. But that\u2019s where the buck stops for her. \n\nWithout knowing more though, it\u2019s hard to say whether the sister is a \u201cgold digger\u201d. It depends on if the donations were a mutual idea, and better yet instigated by the husband, or if the sister single-handedly decided and just said \u201cHey honey let\u2019s give some money to the poor\u201d. I\u2019d actually agree with OP, in that case, that it would be gold digging, because just because your spending money for a good cause, doesn\u2019t actually change the fact that point blank\u2026you are spending money you don\u2019t work for. And single-handedly deciding to spend money, without taking anyone else impacted by that decision into consideration would be extremely entitled and/or gold digger behavior. \n\nAlso, to prove a point, the sister is staying at OP\u2019s place, someone who (most likely) has considerably less disposable income, given the resentment. If you are rich enough to donate, and fly out to either host and/or be recognized for such a donation, then I\u2019d think you\u2019d have enough to get a hotel instead of bothering those less fortunate than yourself. Thus, it\u2019s already entitled for the sister to ask to stay with OP. And, even if both parties were perfectly okay with it, it would be super entitled for the guest to be unaware that the host (OP) was doing her a huge favor by helping her save hundreds in hotel fees, plus probably food expenses. To not only not acknowledge that, but also go out of your way to complain about/insult your hosts and their living conditions.\n\nThus, either way NTA for OP.", "NTA, your sister is way out of line and has forgotten her roots. She may want what's best for you, but she approached it from the worst possible angle by blaming your husband for not being as successful and wealthy as her husband. You can't compare households, because everyone is in a different situation in life. Keep your head up high.", "I\u2019m not sure why people are saying you\u2019re t AH.\nI disagree. NTA.
