The school I went to did a similar thing and tried ti force me into a special math program (I think it helped their scores or something) and I didn\u2019t want to do it, but they forced me to anyway. I just did absolutely awful work and they let me out of it. Your life your choices. If you don\u2019t want to do it, and it\u2019s extra work, don\u2019t do it!", "This is a Malcolm in the Middle episode, by the way.

Sou da suspiciously like something done to raise their score on some metric.\n\nAnd to the people saying \"you need to follow the rules young man!\", oh do please fuck all the way off.

Malcolm doesn\u2019t want Dewey to have to go through the social ostracism he did so he remembers all the answers to the test and pressures Dewey into failing the test. Dewey does so well at failing, the school puts him in the special education class. \n\nSo, kudos for making sure they knew you were failing on purpose, or it could have ended differently for you.", "Oh nta except to yourself. They could easily throw you in remedial classes or recommend you go to a special school for a score that low.

But in reality you may have been better to have aimed for an IQ of 100 which is right in the middle of average range.  It's a normal IQ so they couldn't be sure you were deliberate in your undertaking of the test but it's well below what would be needed for the program.\n\nWhat you may have done is put a target on your back because they know you know what to do to break the rules without it being illegal and gaming the system.", "Why do people waste their time and ours writing fake posts like these?", "I don't understand your logic at all. How did you come up with a 30-40 range? If you scored anything below probably 70 they would know you failed on purpose. \n\nOr maybe 40 is your true score and you're just making up an excuse.

If all things are as you said then you followed the letter of the law if not the spirit. If they don\u2019t like it that\u2019s on them for how they evaluate who should be in the program. Failing a mandatory test still shows them that you are not a good fit for that program which is what the test is trying to show. Good for you for finding a loophole.

Only in a comment.", "Either you\u2019re insecure and tanked on purpose and this story is part fake.

And you deleted the part of the post saying you didn\u2019t want to score above 130", "For the part about deleting something from the OP, I did not.
