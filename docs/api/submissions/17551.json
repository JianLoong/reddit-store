The \"truth\" you decided to focus on had no relevance on what she was asking. I'd recommend starting with an apology.", "I have to say yes, that was kind of an AH thing to do.\n\nI think the point is ... your wife deserves some voice as to when people are coming into her house to visit as do you.  She was trying to make a point and you blew it. Unless you would be totally cool with her family coming over whenever they wanted to, and she can buy the ticket for them without telling you first.\n\nYou owe your wife an apology.  Big time!\n\nYou need to call your mom and set a boundary.  She needs to call and ask if it is okay before buying a plane ticket in the future.  Tell her it is a matter of courtesy, and you hope that she understands.", "YTA. And wow. So rude.", "1st you know YTA. 2nd you think your mom helps but did you ever think your wife doesn't want it or need it. Or your mom is stepping on her toes.

You need to apologize for that first off. \n\nAnd while the affordability part on her family is technically right, you were wrong to bring it up as a response to her question. How would you feel if they were dropping by without consulting you, if you put aside their financial situation? Probably not all peachy.

It's great that you agree with your wife, but just agreeing that your mother should have asked isn't enough.  You need to do something.\n\nDoes your wife agree that your mother' visits are helpful?  Or is that your belief?  This will be her third visit.  How long have you lived abroad?  Three visits might be excessive, depending on the amount of time you have been living there.\n\nThe comment that your wife's parents wouldn't show up unannounced because they are poor was in bad taste.  The issue here isn't about finances, it's about being considerate of others.  Your wife was trying to get you to see things from her perspective - would you feel the same way if her family just announced they were coming to visit without asking?  \n\nYou owe your wife an apology.  And you need to grow a spine and set limits with your mother.", "YTA Your mother has come to visit and yes she should have asked to make sure it did not conflict with any prior plans. I am sure your wife misses her family, what you said was probably pretty hurtful. Why did you feel it necessary to be rude?", "YTA -an entitled, condescending AH. Your poor, under appreciated wife. If I were her, I\u2019d run. Respect goes a long way in a marriage, something you apparently do not have for your wife.", "YTA. \n\nYou wife is right, your mother should've asked permission to visit, not just told you she was coming. And what you said in response to your wife was gross. You completely avoided a very valid question your wife asked you and decide to insult her family instead", "YTA. Your wife wasn't asking a question about finances. She knows her family's financial situation. She was giving a hypothetical for drop-in visits.", "YTA.  Your mother doesn\u2019t get to assume she is welcome in the home you SHARE with your wife. I suspect you said something shitty about her family because you knew she was right, but didn\u2019t want to confront your mother about her wildly inappropriate behavior. That\u2019s really shameful.", "YTA. \n\nFirstly, you should call your mother and tell her to cancel the visit and get permission from you before making a trip. It looks like you care about your mother more than you care about your spouse.\n\nSecondly, you took a cheap shot. It is not okay to criticize the economic situation of your in-laws. International travel is expensive for many people. If I was your wife, I would have bought tickets to my parents with my own money without telling you, so they can come visit me. After all, your mother does not need permission, why should my parents get permission?", "YTA", "The problem is you never answered her question. She asked how you\u2019d feel if someone comes unannounced. You should have said how that would make you fell and not discuss whether it\u2019s a possible or hypothetical scenario", "YTA. Your wife and kids uprooted their lives and left their country for your career. Instead of being grateful you treat your wife as less important. This can't end well for your marriage.", "YTA In what way do you think you're not an asshole? She clearly wanted you to talk about how rude/entitled your mother is, so instead, you insult her entire family?\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that she doesn't get to see her family because you moved her away from them in the first place. Have some fucking compassion for you wife.", "YTA - you answered a valid hypothetical question with a very personal dig at her parents finances. Are you sure you're 38?", "YTA and you know it.\n\nYour wife made a point about your mother's controlling tendencies, but you replied with \"Your parents are poor, ha ha ha *ha* ha.\n\nIf I were your wife, the second the MIL arrives,. I'd take the girls and move out, destination unknown. So your mother would be left with only you to nag and control.\n\nLet's see how you enjoy it.", "NTA \n\nYour wife does not get to be the only one in the family to make decisions. \n\n\n\nIt is ridiculous of your wife to have a fit that a grandmother is coming to visit her grandchild for her birthday. With a 2 months notice.\n\n\nI hope your wife doesn't act like this all the time. She sounds like a very hostile woman.", "YTA.  Do hope your wife kicks you out, changes the locks or takes the week off and goes on holiday with the kids the time your mother visits, maybe to visit her parents? Even better uses your joint money and pays for her mum to come visit the same week then pops off together to enjoy where you live.", "YTA and so is your mom.", "NTA but also not the point. You should have just told your wife \u201cyes, my mom should have asked instead of announcing her trip, but I\u2019m not telling her not to come.\u201d Being straightforward circumvents all of these weird conversational minefields.", "NTA for saying that they can't afford it. I don't see why it's wrong to point out the truth. If they can't afford it they can't afford it. Yta for not getting involved with your own mom's lack of communication.

The question wasn't, \"how likely are my parents to come?\" The question was an ask for you to demonstrate something called empathy. In the adult universe, empathy occurs when you envision a situation, even if might be outside the realm of the immediately tangible, to try to infer what someone else might be experiencing. This is to help you better understand their feelings, even if the situation might be improbable, because the hypothetical situation itself is not the issue--the other person's feelings regarding the ACTUAL situation are the issue. These thought experiments are often deployed when one party is refusing to think outside their extremely narrow of their own experience. Try harder.", "YTA. You missed the entire point.

No need to bring up your in laws financial issues.", "NTA Yes, your mom should have asked if she could come before forcing the issue by purchasing the tickets.  Your wife continuing to complain is basically beating a dead horse. Did you consider just asking her directly what she expects you to do? \n\nIs the timing of the visit genuinely inconvenient or does your wife just not want your mom to come? Does your mom create extra work (and do you help entertain your mom and see to her needs or does that all fall to your wife)?  Is there some underlying resentment that your mom is the grandparent that your kids are bonding with because of her visits while your wife's own parents don't get that opportunity because of their finances?\n\nWhile saying her parents can't afford to come probably made your wife feel hurt-- she violated one of the prime directives of relationships--- NEVER ask a question when you already know the answer.  \n\nIt's sad that your wife's parents can't come to visit but you can't deny your mom visiting because you're wife's parents can't afford to come.

The in-laws have to coordinate time off with their jobs, so we usually get a call at the beginning of the year asking about visits and possible dates that would work.

I'm saying you are asking for someone who you consider to be of authority because you don't seem to want to take anyone's word for this -- like just women saying \"I hate that\" isn't a reason. \n\nA lot of women find it disdainful, objectifying and dehumanizing, not to mention derogatory. And they feel that way because a lot of men who say \"the wife\" are using it to be mocking, disdainful and dehumanizing. But as I'm just a random voice on the internet, what was the point in me telling you that? You either care that it offends people or you don't."]}
