He immediately took this opportunity to take me down and dominate the whole round, I'm not going to go into detail cause violence ain't allowed on this sub. Immediately after the horn sounds to end the round. Now that part was kinda on my since it's not a rule to touch gloves after the bell sounds so it was kinda my bad. so that in itself isn't a reason I'm mad at him for this part. It's how he responded after the round.\n\n\n\nHe immediately got up and started talking trash by saying:\n\n\n\"Bro you stupid I didn't touch gloves with you before why the hell would you think we're touching gloves now\"\n\n\n\nThe fight continues after that and I win. After the fight he tries to shake my hand and I immediately don't accept it and just tell him that he didn't touch before so I ain't shaking now.\n\n\nAnd yeah that's it.

Right on.", "In fact in fencing not shaking hands after the match is a black card giving offense, as well as showing disrespect by throwing your mask away", "MMA isn't as formal as fencing and other sports. In many sports not showing respect before/after the match would be hugely offensive or even unthinkable. It's not quite like that in MMA, although refusing a handshake after the fight is worse than before.\n\nAnyway, OP's opponent's behaviour is completely ridiculous for an amateur fight without previous beef, what a clown. \n\nNTA.", "Well, that's pretty normal after a match tbf. Like the one time this comment is probably absolutely true \ud83e\udd23", "MMA seems to be a bit different. Any contact/fighting sports I've done emphasises respect and self-control, but MMA seems to have a really different culture that way. I did a different blade-sport to fencing, but touching blades before a spar was normal.

You did the same thing", "oh! does kickboxing not count as mma? i only really know abt fencing (my only other sports are football and rugby, and only as a spectator), but one of my younger sisters did kb for a while and the fact that respect was such a big thing there as well was one of the reasons she liked it \u2013 it reminded her of training with our dad \u2013 which is why op's story threw me off so much.", "NTA but coming from a sportsman, the biggest thing that can kill an opponent is your kindness. \n\nThe only thing that matters is you have the respect for them. I show my respect and you don't. It ends there. Both aren't wrong/right.", "NTA\n\nHe disrespected you by not touching gloves before the match, implying he thinks of you as enemy, not an opponent. Also, there is no obligation to shake hands after the match. \nCongratulations on the win!", "NTA in any way", "YTA. You sound sensitive. \n\nIt\u2019s not that big a deal, but touching gloves is the first time you can concretely judge range, so there\u2019s a reason not to do it. Most who recognize it just bow, or touch gloves anyways because they don\u2019t care, but some just completely avoid it like he did. \n\nAlso him doing so clearly messed up your mind enough to get him an easy takedown. He\u2019s totally in the right for taking you down after the bell rang, but yeah, most people wouldn\u2019t do it. Still your fault for not expecting it though. \n\nCongrats on the win, but your mental is pretty weak ngl. Don\u2019t take these things so personally, be the person you want people to see you as, not the person you feel justified in being. \n\nHe came up to shake your hand after the fight, after there was no advantage to being unsportsmanlike. You should have shaken his hand.", "Just touch tips, and get it over with.", "NTA. He sucks. Glad you got the W.", "I don\u2019t want to call you an AH because I do\u2019 my think you are, and he is for not touching gloves at the start. \n\nHe was trying to get into your head and wind you up though, and it sounds like he nearly succeeded. You have to be able to ignore shit like that. \n\nYou also have to maintain your own standards. You should have shaken hands, not to respect him, but because you want to respect yourself and the sport and rise above the petty shit he pulls.", "In Judo, you would be asked to leave if you refuse to Rei (bow). Respect and rules are a big part of Asian martial arts.", "When I was competing, one judoka broke a few rules that the crowd picked up on, and the referees didn't. When it came to collecting medals, the crowd turned their back as they didn't believe the judoka was using sportsmanship in their competing.\n\nJudo is full of tiny bits of respect, which, if not, followed can tarnish your rep in the circuts.", "That's partly because Judo seems to be very strict and disciplined. I did a little bit growing up and I think I remember you could be penalized if you made too much noise as well.", "Typically kickboxing is not MMA. There may be different styles like Muay Thai or Muay Laos that get combined into a 'kickboxing' general class but they're all incredibly similar with slightly varied fight rules. If you're not doing competition fights it's kind of a mute point.\n\nMMA is a very specific thing", "Absolutely, my husband was a national champion so the respect and rules are heavily ingrained in him.", "aaah, i see! thanks for the explanation (:"]}
