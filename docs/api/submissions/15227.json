So before the match when we got called to touch gloves I tried to touch gloves with him. He just said this \n\n\"nah man I don't touch gloves before a fight\"\n\n in a very cocky way. Anybody who knows anything about MMA or boxing knows that touching gloves is a sign of respect and not doing it is a big sign of disrespecting your opponent.\n\n\n\n\nSo the fight starts and as we're starting to come out I try giving him a quick opportunity to touch gloves again. He immediately took this opportunity to take me down and dominate the whole round, I'm not going to go into detail cause violence ain't allowed on this sub. Immediately after the horn sounds to end the round. Now that part was kinda on my since it's not a rule to touch gloves after the bell sounds so it was kinda my bad. so that in itself isn't a reason I'm mad at him for this part. It's how he responded after the round.\n\n\n\nHe immediately got up and started talking trash by saying:\n\n\n\"Bro you stupid I didn't touch gloves with you before why the hell would you think we're touching gloves now\"\n\n\n\nThe fight continues after that and I win. After the fight he tries to shake my hand and I immediately don't accept it and just tell him that he didn't touch before so I ain't shaking now.\n\n\nAnd yeah that's it.

And he used the opportunity to take advantage of you and trash talk to you, and you still won. He basically spit in your face and then asked for a handshake when he lost. Fuck that guy.", "NTA. This kind of thing is common in many sports.  For instance, in fencing, you salute your opponent before the match begins.\r  \n\r  \nYou're acknowledging that you're not enemies, merely opponents.\r  \n\r  \nWillful lack of this kind of respect indicates you're enemies.  You don't shake hands with enemies.", "NTA.\n\nFuck that guy.", "NTA. \n\nYou are a certified dork for trying to touch after the bell.  \nBet you don't do that again. \n\nCongratulations.", "NTA the guys quite literally the asshole I frequent mma and boxing shows so I know how it\u2019s supposed to go, good on you for winning. Although I will say my husband used to hate touching gloves too but would still do it.", "NTA but shit talking is pretty ingrained in the mma world, especially in the UFC. He tried to get into your head, and he succeeded. Glad you came out on top despite that! Lesson learned for next time; they will try to get under your skin, and you can't let them or it'll knock you off your game.", "NTA, respect is a two-way street", "NTA\n\nHe's gonna find himself excluded from a lot of necessary training because nobody wants to deal with someone like that.", "... and the everybody clapped.", "Dude he was doing that on purpose, most likely to get you mad so you fight sloppier. That happens a lot\n\nAnyways at the end of any sport you pay respect to the opponent,  shake hands.\n\nLike  no matter how heated a basketball game gets they shake hands in the end. Same with baseball, boxing and so on. They just do it", "ESH. Macho fuckery isn\u2019t an excuse for poor sportsmanship.", "Children being children", "YTA - Don't let his bad behavior change your behavior. Be yourself. This kind of stuff makes sports toxic.", "ESH. He sucks for not being a good sport before. You suck for not being a good sport after. \n\nI think it\u2019s an important part of martial arts that you stay respectful, even if your opponent is not.", "NAH. Just all seems petty. You got the win just shake his hand. Gamesmanship ends when the bout does.", "ESH:  he has a rule he always follows and you don't.  In other words he will never touch anyone's hands but you would shake everyone's hands but his.
