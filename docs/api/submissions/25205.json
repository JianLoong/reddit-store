Yes, allowances should be made, but bad behavior shouldn\u2019t just be accepted.

Please feel free to share this with your parents.\n\nMy 10yo daughter who is AuDHD is expected to follow rules, treat things and people with respect and she\u2019s amazing.

My daughter continues to thrive and have self confidence (despite some meltdowns and such because\u2026 life & puberty and she\u2019s learning what triggers her as am I) to do things like an all-girls coding club BECAUSE we don\u2019t make excuses or make others acquiesce when she does meltdown, vs me taking the time to be a parent and talk her through it. \n\nAnd that\u2019s what they were doing - it was easier to just force you to give in to him than it was for them to stop what they were doing and help him learn he can\u2019t always have what he wants, then escalate when it\u2019s not what he expected.

I hate seeing the trend more and more that neuro spicy people can get away with awful behavior because of said neuro spicy-ness. It\u2019s like a catch all now for excusing shitty behavior.
