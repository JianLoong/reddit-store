{"id": 23314, "submission_id": "15btbxu", "title": "AITA for telling my(26f) husband(32m) to start wearing diapers to bed?", "selftext": "I have been together with my husband 6 years married almost 4. He has always had a bit of an incontinence issue that pops up at the very least 1-2 times a month. We've tried putting towels or training pads down but it's such a heavy volume of pee when he wets the bed, nothing works. I've never gotten especially upset because I try being understanding and sensitive to his needs. It usually just means a little extra laundry work for me and I know it embarrases him enough already, he'd rather just pretend he didn't do anything. Tonight was kind of the last straw I think, this literally happened like an hour ago.\n\nI am 3 months pregnant, currently fighting off an aggressive cold and have had an extremely tough time sleeping at night/ staying asleep at night. Tonight was no exception. Que usual routine of husband going to bed at 9pm and me tossing, turning and getting up to pee every hour until finally falling asleep around 2am.\n\nI woke up at about 4:15, 15 minutes before my husbands alarm goes off, and noticed the bed was soaked. I was sleeping in half a PUDDLE and could hardly process what has happening. Even with his worst accidents, I rarely wake up with a wet side. We have a fairly big bed and are usually pretty particular about staying on our personal side of the bed. For some reason my husband chose to sleep in the middle of the bed this time causing him to soak me in the process. \n\nI did my best to get up and clean myself off but our street literally has a water shut off for repairs right now so all I can use are wipes. My pregnancy hormones kick in and the smell is too much for me to handle. I tried to not wake him up but my gagging from the bathroom caused it. \n\nHe came to the bathroom grumpy and accused me of taking his underwear off because he woke up without them on for some reason. He didn't even ask if I was okay or anything and I'll admit maybe getting upset at this point was unhelpful but it made me so mad.\n\n\"you probably took them off when you noticed you pissed everywhere and then went back to sleep. My side of the bed and my blanket and even pillows are soaked, I can't even go back to sleep because your accident was in the middle of the bed covering basically the entire thing.\" \n\nHe yelled back that \"at least you don't have to go to work smelling like piss like I do\" \n\n\"you need to start wearing diapers to bed because I can't handle any of this sh** right now. Clean yourself off in the bathroom at work.\" \n\nHe shot a few expletives at me while getting dressed and then walked out. I am literally exhausted and am probably going to go sleep on the couch when I finish this. But, AITA here?\n\nI do feel like I should add here incontinence runs in his family and both his mother and I keep telling him he needs to go see a doctor but he refuses help because he's a bit of an alcoholic and believes doctors will only blame his issues on his drinking. His drinking has been a longstanding issue we have but for the most part I believe it's irrelevant to the situation.", "created_utc": 1690539159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15btbxu/aita_for_telling_my26f_husband32m_to_start/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As if waking up in a puddle of piss wouldn't send someone to the toilet.\n\nNTA. obviously. My ex had an incontinence issue, and he was also an alcoholic; later, type-2 diabetes. Whether it was sleep apnea, the fact he was 400lbs, or the diabeetus, he got medical attention and, eventually, the issue went away.\n\nOh, and he did wear diapers. They have ones specifically for nights where this issue happens.\n\nI'm sorry you're stuck with his spawn. Makes it a lot more difficult to cut and run.", "NTA, if he pretends like it doesn't happen and he refuses to see a doctor, at least get separate beds so he can have his own piss bed and let him take care of it himself.", "OK. Pissing the bed is NOT normal. Not seeking medical help for it is NOT normal. Getting annoyed at you because HE wet the bed is NOT normal.\nMake him sleep on the sofa and he can lie there on the stinky pee cushions by himself. NTA. Please get help with this.", "NTA \n\nI feel bad for him, sucks to have this issue but he doesn\u2019t wanna go to a doctor and wants to get pissy (excuse the pun) when you\u2019re upset cos he\u2019s soaked you on his urine???", "NTA\n\nBut you say: it usually means extra work for me..\nDon\u2019t make it your job. \n\nIt bad for him this happens, but he doesn\u2019t seem to want to do anything about it.\nHe maybe can\u2019t help the issue, but he can try to \u2018fix\u2019 it. Not willing to do that makes him TA.\nAnd then start being mad at you and making you responsible and telling the lies.. \nI would be furious.\n\nHe can take of the bed, do the laundry and make the bed. Maybe when he has to do this he understands it\u2019s a real problem and he can do something about it.\n\nI think lots of things can be done. Go see a doctor (and probably start drinking less), wear diapers, set alarms during the night and go to the bathroom.\n\nThe fact it happens doesn\u2019t make him TA.\nHow he is acting and not willing to do something makes him TA big time!", "Girl, he is most likely getting in bed completely wasted and peeing himself because of that. \n\nYWBTA if you don't get your relationship sorted before you bring a child into the world with this guy.", "NTA- My boyfriend had the same thing happening, they ended up putting him on a night time med to help,  This med has been a LIFESAVER", "NTA it was definitive when you said he is an alcoholic and refuses to see a doctor about this. I was already thinking no healthy adult wets the bed so he needs to see a doc. But he has an alcohol problem?! That sure makes people wet themselves after drinking too much, doesnt matter if he's halfway functioning during the day. Major red flag, draw some basic boundaries.", "I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. \n\nYou may need to actually book an appointment to see your GP and tell hubby that the appointment is booked for xx date yy time.  And go with him.  Write down all your concerns, including the drinking and family history.  \n\nFor you, I'd be more concerned about your health and the health of the baby with sleeping in in and breathing in the ammonia smell.", "How bad is this drinking problem and is there any chance he\u2019s just drunk pissing himself?", "Also confused because OP mentions in the comments on another post that she\u2019s in a complicated situationship\u2026 with your husband, soon to be father of your child? I may be vague on these terms, but isn\u2019t situationship the opposite of being married?", "OP \ud83d\udc9b AA is cheaper than diapers. \n\nYou have to take care of yourself and y\u2019all\u2019s baby. You cannot take care of someone continuing on with an alcohol use disorder. You\u2019re gonna have another person\u2019s pee to clean up soon so you can\u2019t keep cleaning up his. Take care of yourself and I hope he does the same for himself. Absolute best of luck to you all.", "NTA. It\u2019s a medical problem he refuses to go to the doctor for. I\u2019d be livid. He doesn\u2019t even clean it up himself? And you\u2019re pregnant? Nothing about you is what\u2019s messed up here", "Y'all some hypocrites.\n\nThere was a story basically like this except the genders were reversed. Wife refused to wear diapers despite wetting the bed and y'all called the husband an asshole.\n\nNTA here. But the rest of you are.", "NTA. Maybe he needs some medical help, but you should not have to put up with it. He should be wearing a diaper or sleeping in a separate bed.", "Actually, I think you're wrong on the drinking part. As an alcoholic in recovery and a friend to many alcoholics, incontinence after heavy drinking is not that uncommon. Especially if you're soused enough you a. take off your underwear and b. flood the bed and sleep through doing it. Your husband has a drinking problem.", "NTA. \n\nHe refuses to go to the doctor. \n\nHe\u2019s an alcoholic. \n\nI hope you don\u2019t let your kid experience his rage.", "The alcohol might not be the sole cause, but it doesn't help anything. It makes it worse. I mean, when I used to abuse alcohol I'd sometimes also mix with my sleeping pills and even with all that I NEVER wet the bed. I wasn't always completely awake when getting up to pee, but I still made it. If he's able to not only pee in his sleep but also stay asleep while soaked then something is seriously wrong. You owe it to yourself and your unborn child to demand that he seek help. He needs to talk to a doctor and he needs to sort out his drinking. \n\nA home with an alcoholic parent isn't a safe environment for a child. Add to that his pissing on his wife and seemingly not giving a fuck it's just toxic all around.", "NTA. Have you tried a pee alarm? My teenaged son was still a chronic bed wetter but two weeks in he was trained and it was a life saver. It was $180 or something but worth every penny. It's worth a shot.", "You would be the asshole to yourself and your unborn child if you stayed with a man who is so clearly an alcoholic that he is wetting the bed multiple times a month.", "NTA. He has probably acted this way out of embarrassment. But,\nIf he doesn't want to live with the embarrassment anymore, he should get the help he needs and see a Dr. This is super unhygienic and what's going to happen if you end up having your kid in your bed and they wake up in your husbands wee.", "OP, he\u2019s pissing the bed cuz he\u2019s too drunk to wake up and you just sit there and lay in it regularly? YTA for having no self esteem", "NTA and hooboy do you guys need to be in therapy and he needs a urologist too.", "NTA he\u2019s TAH if he has a problem (2 problems) and refuses to get help for it (them).  The alcohol may not be the reason for the issue but I guaran-god-damn-Ty you it is exacerbating the issue.", "Not here to issue a ruling but I'm an adult diaper fetishist. For that kind of volume he would need to wear premium diapers, like Megamaxes or Trest Elites which cost $4-$5 a diaper. He would also probably need to wear plastic pants and he could never sleep on his side.", "NTA, that is not normal.\nNo way I would think it was okay for my spouse to wake up in my urine. I would start to wear diapers myself (and clean up my own mess). The fact that he doesnt concerns me a bit.\nAlso, I cannot stress this enough, this is not normal. He should see a doctor. And if he drinks so much a doctor will suspect he doesnt wake up to pee from intoxication, he should really stop drinking.\nQuestion: why couldnt he wash up in your house? Or was the smell of your gagging to overwhelming for him,  even though you are supposed to sleep in his pee?", "It is because he's an alcoholic.  If it runs in the family it's because those family members were also alcoholics.  Let's not try to redirect the real issue here.  Adult pads are not going to solve this problem, your husband needs help regarding his drinking asap and in the meantime have him sleep somewhere else.  Lots of us here who have loved ones who are alcoholics telling you this.  Adult men aren't just pissing the bed all the time for no reason.  But alcoholics do.  \nAnd as an adult child of an alcoholic, let me tell you that growing up with that was not great.  I have no doubt this issue is far from the only one that comes from his drinking and I hope you recognize how badly it could affect your kids to grow up like this if your husband doesn't get help\nEdited to add ESH because yeah you are right to not want him to piss the bed but thinking depends is a resolution when there is a much bigger issue is worrisome.", "ESH. Him for not going to the doctor, or even better, a therapist to deal with his alcoholism. You for deciding that getting pregnant in this situation was a great idea. You can\u2019t be a \u2018bit of an alcoholic\u2019. You either are one or you\u2019re not. If multiple times a month he drinks so much to the point where he literally pisses himself in the bed he is definitely an alcoholic. You really want your child to be raised by an alcoholic? You really want your child to sleep in your bed one night and wake up in his dads piss? I\u2019m honestly flabbergasted by all these stories on here about women getting pregnant in all these unhealthy relationships/ situations.", "NTA this 100% linked to his alcohol abuse. If he keeps drinking it will only get worse. Sorry but do you really wanna raise a child under this circumstances?", "And why exactly are you making babies with an incontinent alcoholic? YTA for that alone! And the way you swiftly mention it at the end as if that\u2019s not the biggest problem leaves me flabbergasted!", "Separate beds time? Let him sort his own out. NTA but you can't go on like this. You've been more than generous to date but this would be a good time to draw the line.", "NTA but you will be if you don't force him to get help.\n\nSaying his incontinence has nothing to do with his alcoholism is seriously na\u00efve and you need to get this and his head sorted before you welcome your child into the world.", "NTA - We, as pregnant women, often wear diapers at the end of our pregnancy and postpartum. Why is he so proud that he's making you uncomfortable? Tell him you don't judge him for the incontinence, just the unwillingness to deal with it.", "I\u2019m just astounded that some people live in their own bubbles for so long, they lose track of reality and need external opinions about whether telling your husband that you don\u2019t want to wake up covered in his piss is being TA.\n\nNo, you\u2019re NTA. But you both need help.", "NTA", "Heavy drinking would be a big part of this. I had similar problem, although not as bad when I drank too much.", "Don't share a bed with him.\n\nYou're pregnant, his pee could cause harm to your kid and yourself ! (Even when not pregnant)\n\nPlus if he pretend nothing is happening and you're cleaning his mess, why would he find a solution when you do it all.\n\nNTA", "This isn\u2019t a sustainable relationship and it\u2019s going to get worse if nothing is done. If my partner wet the bed often enough that they should be wearing a diaper but refused and tried to make me feel bad for bringing it up, I think I\u2019d have to make sure that their piss stained mattress was the only thing they kept.", "NTA \n\nBut, girl.", "NTA no one should be pissing the bed at 32 unless there's a problem that a professional needs to look into. Also alcoholism isn't the best environment to bring a child into. Furthermore why couldn't he have a shower and clean himself up before going to work? Better to be late than smell like piss.", "NTA. You two need separate beds and he needs diapers.", "Lol how do people like this get to be in relationships and normal people are just overlooked", "\"He's bit of an alcoholic\" - I was waiting to see this line. There's the issue. Does he piss himself when he is not passed out drunk?\n\nRegardless, NTA, he should get help for it, and wear or do something that doesn't cause you to wake up in his piss. As that's just not fair on you at all. \n\nPerhaps consider alternative sleeping arrangements until/if he sorts himself out. Sleeping on the sofa has got to be better than waking up in a pool of piss.", "M.E.D.I.C.A.L. I.S.S.U.E.\n\nWhether this relates to his physical or mental health (or both), he needs to see a professional ASAP!!! PLEASE don't shame him out of frustration. You're having a child with this man.

The fact you\u2019ve put up with this for so long is crazy to me.", "Why are you changing the sheets and washing them?  No way would I be doing that for a fully grown man and you need to stand up for yourself on this.   It is time to insist that he get help with both the drinking and the peeing the bed.

He has always had a bit of an incontinence issue that pops up at the very least 1-2 times a month. We've tried putting towels or training pads down but it's such a heavy volume of pee when he wets the bed, nothing works. I've never gotten especially upset because I try being understanding and sensitive to his needs. It usually just means a little extra laundry work for me and I know it embarrases him enough already, he'd rather just pretend he didn't do anything. Tonight was kind of the last straw I think, this literally happened like an hour ago.\n\nI am 3 months pregnant, currently fighting off an aggressive cold and have had an extremely tough time sleeping at night/ staying asleep at night. Tonight was no exception. Que usual routine of husband going to bed at 9pm and me tossing, turning and getting up to pee every hour until finally falling asleep around 2am.\n\nI woke up at about 4:15, 15 minutes before my husbands alarm goes off, and noticed the bed was soaked. I was sleeping in half a PUDDLE and could hardly process what has happening. Even with his worst accidents, I rarely wake up with a wet side. We have a fairly big bed and are usually pretty particular about staying on our personal side of the bed. For some reason my husband chose to sleep in the middle of the bed this time causing him to soak me in the process. \n\nI did my best to get up and clean myself off but our street literally has a water shut off for repairs right now so all I can use are wipes. My pregnancy hormones kick in and the smell is too much for me to handle. I tried to not wake him up but my gagging from the bathroom caused it. \n\nHe came to the bathroom grumpy and accused me of taking his underwear off because he woke up without them on for some reason. He didn't even ask if I was okay or anything and I'll admit maybe getting upset at this point was unhelpful but it made me so mad.\n\n\"you probably took them off when you noticed you pissed everywhere and then went back to sleep. My side of the bed and my blanket and even pillows are soaked, I can't even go back to sleep because your accident was in the middle of the bed covering basically the entire thing.\" \n\nHe yelled back that \"at least you don't have to go to work smelling like piss like I do\" \n\n\"you need to start wearing diapers to bed because I can't handle any of this sh** right now. Clean yourself off in the bathroom at work.\" \n\nHe shot a few expletives at me while getting dressed and then walked out. I am literally exhausted and am probably going to go sleep on the couch when I finish this. But, AITA here?\n\nI do feel like I should add here incontinence runs in his family and both his mother and I keep telling him he needs to go see a doctor but he refuses help because he's a bit of an alcoholic and believes doctors will only blame his issues on his drinking. His drinking has been a longstanding issue we have but for the most part I believe it's irrelevant to the situation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can\u2019t believe you are the only one doing any problem solving here. \n\nQuestion: do you have a spare sleeping space in your home? \n\nI would refuse to sleep in the bed with him/do any piss clean up until he sees (NOT just *agrees to see*) a doctor. It\u2019s not fair that he isn\u2019t doing a single thing to manage this and then you have to clean the sheets on top of that. If y\u2019all have extra sheets, put them somewhere else so he\u2019s only pissing up the one set and will need to wash that set himself. Make it his problem so he can see how much he is actually inconveniencing you.", "NTA but honestly as you say yourself he needs to  see a doctor and you need to get support for his angry outbursts. You cannot look after a newborn and an adult baby. It's too much.\n\nIf not you will have to get your own bed and sleep in that. He can clean his own mess up. But it sounds like he would have a go at you for that. If it's so embarrassing for him that he expects you to sleep in his urine and be quiet about it then leave if you can. At least until he sorts himself out. For example if you can stay with your parents for a bit. I assume he will refuse counseling as well?", "This. Its disturbing. I wouldn't trust him around any kids.", "Where did op say it was alcohol related?", "OP stated the city has shut off water for maintenance/repairs.", "This is my suggestion as well don\u2019t share a bed or room. If possible move out for a bit Let him deal with the mess and smell. You have to look after you m,and the baby. He\u2019s alcoholic who would rather get drunk and piss himself than deal with his issues", "In the post it says their water was currently off in their area which was why OP had to clean up with only wipes", "Married with a child on the way, wild times", ">Even if this has damaged you... Please try to have compassion and get him help, rather than damaging him\n\nSounds as if it's ok for the wife to be 'damaged' but we absolutely can't have the husband 'damaged'... \n\n>more than his own Self Critic is probably already damaging himself\n\nYou sure about that?", "I never comment on here usually, but this time I have to. \n\nHe has a medical condition of course, one that can bring shame and anger and at that I can be with you. \n\nBut taking it out on your pregnant wife, who washes your piss stained sheets every time, because she had the AUDACITY of throwing up because you pissed on her AGAIN for a thing that YOU don't get checked? That's a bit much to leave out of the picture and should be addressed. \n\nThe peeing is not his fault, his attitude totally is.", "God I hope they don\u2019t let the bby sleep in their bed if the dude is so hammered he can\u2019t wake up to piss. Poor kid is probably gonna have a bit of a rough one if its parents don\u2019t sort their shit out", "Yeah OP decided to have a baby with an alcoholic. It\u2019s amazing how that is in the last paragraph! \n\nBut yea she need to take care of herself (and baby!) first!", "Idk where you read anything about alcohol, might be the case, might not be.", "Surely you know you and your future child deserve better than this.", "Also, he\u2019s most likely peeing the bed because he had too much alcohol, a full bladder, but is too wasted to wake up from it. Going to the doctor would probably confirm it and he knows it.", "OP said their water is shut off right now for repairs so they\u2019re unable to shower", "OP said the street has a water shut-off for repairs.", "I assume OP want this child, so there is no point of writing 'do you want to bring him/her to this world'. \n\nAlso, I am a child of alcoholic father and he had this issue. My poor mom suffered for years. I remeber our home smelling like piss, alcohol and hang over. He was a good person, I loved him very much, but my father was a weak person trying to cure his depression with alcohol.\n\nOP should press him to go to a doctor, even at cost of their relationship, because IT IS an alcohol related problem. And unfortunately, with years it only gets worse.  Cleaning after him, just enables and downplays his situation.", "The answer is clearly yes already though", "I don't agree with your judgment, but 100% with your comment.\n\nOP: He has a problem, and it's his responsibility to fix it, not yours. Make that clear in your behaviour.", "Former alcoholic! I have thankfully never pissed myself (nice to meet you!) but know too many old friends that did. During my sobering up phase I still went to hang out until one night I'm riding my pals stationary bike while he's passed out - he literally stood up and pissed all over his wall then sat back down and went to sleep again.\n\nVery content with not having many friends these days lol \n\nOP, his drinking is VERY MUCH RELEVANT I believe to this situation", "That kind where people are plastered.", "She said she does the laundry after his accidents, so no he's not cleaning either", "The water was shut off for repairs, op said she cleaned herself with wipes.", "Bleed is the correct term to use in that sentence. Your English is great. :)\n\n(Another way to say it would be \u201cI have really heavy periods\u201d.)", "Yes wtf is with all these Not the a? \n\nThis behavior is not new, it\u2019s been happening, and OP still got pregnant and is keeping the pregnancy when the father is a fucking alcoholic, who pisses the goddamn bed and makes her clean it. She is an asshole to herself if nothing else, and an asshole to her kid if she stays with this loser ESH except the fetus, I feel sorry for the fetus.", "First time someone told me I was an alcoholic, it was when I pissed in their bed while asleep... I thanked them for it years later, but denied it in the moment...", "Their street water is turned off for repairs currently.", "This. Also, the alcohol ***absolutely*** is a factor, as it\u2019ll make him sleep more deeply, missing cues that he needs to get up and goooo. \n\nHe is 100% TA here, you are NTA.", "All of this!!! Not to mention do you want to be with the type of person who refuses to go to the doctor for YEARS when they have a very serious health problem????? Does this seem like the type of person who will be a good coparent? Why do you even want to continue this relationship??\n\nNTA but why are you doing this to yourself. These are not small things.", "Speaking as someone who lived with an alcoholic for 8 long years, I agree with everything you said there. The worst thing I ever did was assume they'd change and I ended up fighting a fight that wasn't mine. It's no way to live. I hope OP reconsiders this relationship for the sake of herself and her kid.", "The part \u201che refuses to see a doctor about it because he thinks they\u2019ll blame his alcoholism for his incontinence\u201d like, fucking duh? You piss the bed and induce in beverages that numb your senses and make you piss twice as much. OP, you\u2019re NTA, but need to leave now.", "That was the thing that baffeld me too...a know alcholic and getting a kid with him.\n\nAs daughter of a alcholic mom I know how much its sucks.\nShe did wet the bed as well.", "honestly if op was the one who had incontinence and didn\u2019t do sh*t about it - husband would be out the door first day in \ud83d\udc80\n\nsometimes I think are men being cruel when they dump their sick wives or do women just put up with too much \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah, and OP is 3 months pregnant now, so she can move relatively easy, but what if/when she's 8 months in and has trouble with getting out of bed? For how long more will she have to lay in a urine-soaked bed before she's able to get up?", "Yep raised by alcos and dated one. Woke up in piss several times after real heavy drinking nights. OP has some sort of Stockholm syndrome where she\u2019s bought his lies and seems to believe them. It\u2019s pretty sad a kid will grow up around this.", "Yeah it kind of threw me that it was solely a medical issue until that little tidbit thrown in at the end. The drinking absolutely will make it worse. \n\nOP, you will have a baby whose diapers you will have to change. If your husband is too passed out to change his own damn mess, you're not going to get much help with a tiny human either. Your husband really needs to wake up and get help, and you need to stop enabling his behavior.", "Rather, I recommend the wife not push the husband to the point he snaps and damages HER. Sometimes a more... subtle... approach, is more effective. And less risky.", "Agreed, but as far as pragmatic solutions go-\n\nConfrontation is NOT going to end well.\n\nGently saying \"babe, I'm worried about you, I'm scared for your health, I'm afraid of losing you, I love you so much, would you please see a doctor?\" Might just accomplish the desired result.\n\nWhen dealing with that sort of man, one must be, above all, CAREFUL. Break that fragile ego, and the whole pantheon of gods can't help you. \n\nEspecially when dealing with a legit medical condition, and the DOUBLE indignity being betrayed by one's own body.\n\nSource=personal experience.", "Ah thanks. Totally zombied over that.", "Thank you! I learned something new today. Thanks kind redditor! :)", "Not necessarily\u2026 my mother\u2019s bladder isn\u2019t attached properly and has been pissing the bed her whole life. She was married to her last husband nearly 25 years before he passed. She used diapers but it was never enough. Their bed was layered with 4-5 bed sheets and dozens of towels every night. 3 loads of wash every day. Step dad never complained once and often did the wash and made the bed himself. Thing is he cared enough about her that he accepted my mother\u2019s disability as part of who she was. He slept with her every night.", "Tbf to OP it is really difficult to leave a toxic relationship, especially when there's substance abuse issues. I literally put up with months of physical abuse before I decided enough was enough - and I still have a shit ton of guilt about leaving. But, I don't have kids, and OP needs to start setting boundaries in order to protect their child and start building an exit plan when this, inevitably, goes sideways.", "His Self Critic could potentially become very dangerous to her.", "I'm sorry but no. I have personal experiences about this kind of things too, but there can only be so much babying before the breaking point.\n\nShe already told him nicely, his mother told him nicely, SHE WASHES THE PISS SHEETS and spares him the shame, so there's plenty of sweet in there already. \n\nBut that can only go on so long if he insists in being insufferable. HE is going to have a child with her also, and is HIS responsability to be fit to do so. \n\nI'm sorry but the blame and weight of this can't be on her, he's a grown man and should care for himself, moreso if he's pissing on his wife.", "But it sounds like you mom had gone to the doctor, she did her due diligence and your wonderful step dad supported her through her medical issues. \n\nOP is married to a drunk who is pretending nothing is wrong", "I get it, but having a kid live through that will screw them up for life.", "Oh he's the asshole for sure! There should be a special Hell for people who get drunk and pee where they shouldn't...\n\nBut guilt and shame can drive people to lash out in ways that are, in my opinion, worse than dealing with a wet bed. So, unfortunately, in the interest of self preservation, I would absolutely recommend babying, sweet talking, cajoling, nudging, kindly insinuating.\n\nWhatever it took to get that man inside a damn doctor's office.\n\nThen the DOCTOR could tell it like it is. And there's no way I'd get hurt.", "Oh absolutely, agree with you there", "If this is already a situation where she has to sweet talk and baby him for her own safety, then it's a take your documents, pack your bag and run situation.", "Yeah... You're probably right."]}
