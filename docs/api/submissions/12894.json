I no longer swim or cycle but can manage everyday tasks. It obviously gets me down but I have an amazingly supportive husband. \n\nWe are best friends with a couple who we met through my husband's work 10 years ago and 6 months ago they announced they were getting married. We were asked to be  bridesmaid and best man and were obviously over the moon. Sadly a month later I was told they felt it would be too much for me to be a bridesmaid and they had chosen someone else. I was shocked and hurt because surely its my choice? My husband is still a best man and will be sitting on the top table with them while I am on the furthest away table near the door, sitting with people I don't know.  \n\nI don't know if my husband has said something but the bride to be has suddenly invited me to a champagne brunch on the morning of the wedding in her bedroom with her bridesmaids and mother. She says I can stay while they have their hair, make up and photos done. I feel like a charity case and really don't want to attend the wedding but am worried it will make things awkward for my husband.

Just ask her\u2026 hey what\u2019s happening? \u201cI\u2019m sure you were trying to be helpful but it\u2019s made me feel X\u2026\u201d etc. Maybe she is being an AH but always check before you reply in kind. Sorry they made you feel that way though, if intended or not, that\u2019s shitty. Hope you can find a resolution", "NTA- if she was really your friend, she would accommodate you in any way possible to include you in her wedding ceremony and reception. Also, it\u2019s laughable that her idea of including you is allowing you to have champagne while THEY get their hair, makeup, and photos done. \n\nIf your husband is supportive, he should drop out of the wedding, because it\u2019s inexcusable how you\u2019re being treated. The fact that you\u2019re not even sitting close to the head table makes me feel like they\u2019re trying to keep you two separated on purpose.", "NTA, they're awful and your husband should have stepped down as soon as they pulled this bs. He should back out. Agreed on the bride just trying to save face.", "NTA You don't have to boycott officially, you can just tell herthat you're clearly unwelcome and won't have any fun sitting with strangers so far away from your husband so you'll just make other plans for the day. The snub of deciding for you rather then asking you sounds like a lie. Just back away like she wants you to and hope your husband supports you. He doesn't have to sit at that table. He can ask to sit with you. Maybe he will care nore about you than about this people who don't want you. If he doesn't, then maybe you've learned something about his character that will help you decide whether to stay in the marriage.", "NTA.  Dropping OP without a conversation with them about what they can and can't do was pretty terrible of them.  Splitting OP from husband and having them sit a separate tables would be were I would expect both of them to bail entirely.", "NTA First you're a bridesmaid and now you're just going to sit at a table furthest away by the door? What a demotion and an insult. I'd tell her off and refuse to go. Yes it's the bride's choice but by the door? And why isn't your husband defending you?", "NTA. They don\u2019t want you, you don\u2019t want them.", "You are NTA, but your husband needs to join you in the boycott.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't feel welcome after being removed from the bridal party, shunted off to Siberia for the reception, and that you'd have to pay to get your makeup and hair done before the wedding. They don't sound like friends at all, especially when the husband to be accuses you of sulking.   \n\n\nI do agree with the people that say you should have a heart to heart with your husband and explain why you're hurt and don't feel even welcome at the reception. \n\nI'm so sorry that your \"friends\" are AHs.", "NTA. If they hadn't asked you to be a bridesmaid at all it'd be different. Asking and rescinding is hurtful, especially for the reason given.", "If this happened to me I would never speak to them again. They would simply cease to exist.", "NTA. Who uninvites someone this way? \n\nAlso: so are YOU getting the fancy treatment at brunch or just watching the group you were originally part of get dressed?\n\nBecause if it\u2019s the latter\u2026that\u2019s leveling up on the shitty person-meter. Like Mario just found a fire flower from hell and is, in fact, a super villain.", "NTA\n\nBut it sounds like these people are more your husband\u2019s friends than yours.  And normally that would be ok - couples are allowed to have separate friends from each other - but it was a jerk move for them to pretend they were your \u201cbest friends\u201d if they didn\u2019t actually mean it.  If they didn\u2019t want you to be a bridesmaid, they should never have asked you to begin with.", "NTA just don't go....  why go and be uncomfortable", "Go to the wedding but do not go to the brunch. I had something like this happen to me and I went to the hair/makeup and it was so awkward. Everyone was getting their pictures taken and having this camaraderie with in jokes and I just sat there by myself. I had nothing to do but watch them all get along.", "NTA. I'd rest and medicate for a week in advance and be the life of the fucking party all night, making friends with everyone because you've got all this free time because brides-name decided you were too ill to be a bridesmaid. To be fair, I'm a bitch with an invisible disability so I may be biased lol", "NTA. The polite and considerate thing would have been to tell you how much she wanted you as a bridesmaid and to ask you to be sure to tell her if there\u2019s anything you need to make it comfortable and possible. But she decided for you.  It\u2019s really a shame you\u2019ll be having a particularly bad day on the day of the wedding and will be forced to stay home all day in your most comfortable clothes, binging Netflix and eating your favorite foods.\n\nIs there any chance you sometimes use a cane or some other device or that you walk fairly slowly and she didn\u2019t like the way you might look or something?", "NTA\n\nGo to the brunch. Eat the yummy food, drink as much as you want. Since you are no longer a member of the wedding party, you have zero responsibilities. \n\nTalk with your husband about your concerns for the reception. He can come sit with you or you can both just leave and go get a romantic dinner somewhere else. The couple won't say a word, because they'll just assume it's about your diagnosis. \n\nThis is a win-win for you.", "NTA - but I think you need to have an honest conversation with your husband about everything that is going on and how this is making you feel.  \n\nExplain everything and that you feel they are now giving you some sort of apology pity and you are worried he had something to do with it.  The best marriages last because both people are able to be vulnerable with each other.  You may feel you have been doing this more but the fact you were excluded because of something that you are going through is making it worse.\n\nYour husband can refuse to sit with the groom and come back with you if he wants.  \n\nAfter the wedding you can right your friend a letter.  Don\u2019t do it before be nice but say how hurt you were that she decided on her own that your condition made it so she didn\u2019t want you there anymore.\n\nUnderstand this is extremely tricky since you both are obviously very close friends and that is why your husband needs to step up now.", "NAH. If you truly are friends, you need to tell them how you feel. Maybe they don\u2019t fully understand your limitations.", "~~NAH~~ \\- you can boycott if your feelings are hurt, but they have no obligation to make you a bridesmaid.\n\nEDIT: NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m not sure the bride is TA either. Perhaps she\u2019s actually trying to be considerate of you and just went about it the wrong way. Can you find it in your heart to forgive this perceived slight and attend?", "NTA. Looks like your husband F'd this one up for you without asking you how you felt first.", "NTA. Don't go to that wedding, they don't want you there. I also think you should tell your husband the truth in advance, he should be able to know they hurt you and choose if he still wants to be a bestman.", "NTA\n\nAnd i can't believe your husband is still going as a member of the bridal party after all this? Where the F is his loyalty? Not with his wife, that is for sure...", "Hi, thanks for your advice. I did speak to her about it in the beginning but she said she was worried it would cause me too much pain and stress. I just wish she'd spoke to me before deciding on my behalf.", "This absolutely! She is NTA and husband should be supportive, wish them well and drop out of the wedding on your behalf. How insulting to have you sit as if you are a mere acquaintance. I once had someone \"let\" me ride in the limousine with all the other bridesmaids to the wedding, it was a horrible experience, and very embarrassing.", "Every wedding I've been to has been open seating and the wedding party officially sits at the head table but can move around as they please. I wonder if it's possible for them to leave a seat open next to her for her husband?", "I think it was a lie too to be honest. I think she just changed her mind. I'd rather she was truthful tho. I think hubby feels caught in the middle and wants to keep the peace. He doesn't like confrontation which I understand.", "Ps NTA", "The hairdresser is actually one of the bridesmaids and I think she felt sorry for me so said if there's time she'll do my hair too but unlike the others I'd have to pay. The photos will only be of the bridal party.", "Oh no I'm sorry you had to go through that.  You obviously know how I feel. Thanks for the advice.", "Thank you for your advice. You are absolutely right I do walk slowly at times and on bad days use a stick. The bride is very appearance orientated and I actually feel this is exactly why I was dropped.", "I never looked at it like that thank you. I will have a word with hubby about sitting with me and how I feel then decide. Thank you.", "I completely agree about them having no obligation it was just that they did ask me in the beginning. If they hadn't asked me I wouldn't have thought anything if that makes sense.", "It would be one thing if they never asked, but she was asked to be a bridesmaid and the offer was taken back a month later.", "I could have forgiven her until I saw the seating plan. I couldn't be any further from the top table and my husband. That's what hurts the most. I feel this is intentional and not considerate at all. Thank you for your advice though. You obviously have a good heart \u2764\ufe0f", "Yes, her deciding for you how much you can take was so rude.     Why not *ask* you?   \n\nThen to put you furthest away from the table seems like a slap in the face.  \n\nNTA   do what you want.   I'd have a conversation  with my husband  about it.    Why isn't he supporting you in this?", ">. I think hubby feels caught in the middle and wants to keep the peace. He doesn't like confrontation which I understand. \n\nIf your husband is choosing to still be best man he should at the very least be pushing for you to be sitting with him during dinner. Why in the world are you at the very back?", "Wow.\nJust wow.\n\nI would not go to that. I would also only go the ceremony to show support for the point of the day - the actual marriage. Then I\u2019d leave.\n\nAre they doing a bridal party bus/limo after the wedding but before the dinner/reception? If so, do you get to do that or are you literally on your own for hours until your husband can get away when dancing starts?\n\nThis just gets worse.", "OMG the more you explain the worse it gets.  Talk about a slap on the face.  The bride is not your friend. I would be upset at my husband too for not standing up for me when they did this.  His \u201c no confrontation \u201c says a lot.  He should\u2019ve stepped down when you were replaced.  i would not attend at all - i would have other plans.   Seating you near the door. omg.", "I did actually say I'd dose myself up and not use the cane but still not enough.", "Totally makes sense. You are not doing anything wrong and if I were in your shoes, my feelings would be hurt as well. I am assuming (optimistically) that they have/had a good reason to switch you out as a bridesmaid. Other commenters advised you to ask the couple what the reason was for removing you as a bridesmaid. I tend to agree - hopefully they have a good reason. If not, then I would change to NTA.", "I agree with you, but I am (optimistically) assuming there was no malice in the couple's decision. My vote would change to NTA if OP asks and finds out the reason for removing her as a bridesmaid was unreasonable or prejudiced. Probably a big assumption though, but without further information, don't want to demonize the couple.", "Maybe this calls for a conversation among the four of you so she can explain and everyone can speak frankly. I hate to see a friendship end this way if it\u2019s really a misunderstanding.", "That's not acceptable.  Your \"friend\" is ableist, hence being taken out of the bridal party and beinf exiled at the reception.  Your husband shouldn't even be accepting you being treated this way.  At the very least you should be seated with people you would enjoy in eyesight of you husband, or better yet next to him.  \n\nI'm sorry OP, these people stink and don't deserve your friendship or any of your time.", "I think he feels awkward as he's the best man. He doesn't know what the groom to be said to me and I don't want to cause trouble. The wedding is only a month away so as upset as I am I wouldn't want him to pull out so close to it.", "I've actually thought of going to the ceremony then pulling a sickie. There's no party bus or anything but as I'm not in the bridal party photos I won't be with my husband before the dinner and during the dinner.", "OP says above that she asked and was told it's because she has MS and the bride decided, without talking to OP, that it would be too painful and stressful for OP to participate. So yes--the bride has behaved terribly and OP is NTA.", "I did speak to the bride to be not long after I found out I was no longer a bridesmaid. She said she felt it would be too much for me to handle and I said it wouldn't as I can still get about but she insisted she was thinking of me. I wondered if I was being over sensitive till I saw how far away I was sitting.", "I see.    It's an awkward situation.", "This may be douchey of me to suggest but....could you say your MS is playing up? I don't know much about the condition, but my mind went straight to 'well if that's why she's saying you're not a bridesmaid, use it to your advantage'. \n\nThe other option is pure transparency with husband and the to be couple, but I understand that can be difficult.", "Okay - found out you already asked the bride why you were removed as a bridesmaid, sounds like bullshit. Also, ugh to the seating arrangement thing - forgot about that detail and that really sucks. Sorry you have to go through this. You are NTA.", "It is isn't it. Thanks for your advice though.", "One of my other friends said exactly the same thing. To be honest there are days when it's really bad and I just power through even tho my Spexialist says I shouldn't. I just feel this is proving the bride right though and justifying her reasons.if that makes sense. But if I'm not that important I'm guessing I wouldn't even be missed so ....\n\nI tried talking to her about it but it got me nowhere.", "Let your husband be in the wedding and just don\u2019t attend. I\u2019m sorry they are treating you like this.", "Yeah I saw in your other replies your attempt wasn't successful. I more meant a sit down with all of you and being very open and raw - I.e. I'm hurt because x. Your reaction is also making me feel y. \n\nBut to be honest I wouldn't feel comfortable myself doing that, especially if so far its not been received well.\n\nGastro is always a good lie, no one ever questions butt and vomit stuff. \n\nAnd try not to look at it as her being proven right, look at it as you doing what you need to, to protect yourself mentally and from having a shitty time.\n\nBest of luck to you OP", "I have EDS.  Not the same, but I deal with people making decisions for me as well and it's beyond infantilising.  I disagree with ducking out early unless you genuinely need to.  It only proves them \"right\" and increases the behavior in them and others.  It also invalidates you should you choose to address this in conversation later.\n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this.  There's no good answer.  Personally, I'd attend the wedding but skip the brunch.", "Thank you!", "Thank you \ud83d\ude18", "I'm sorry to hear you are in a similar situation and you are right it's so demoralising. I totally agree about not proving them right but I am so hurt and humiliated especially as i know her bridesmaids are aware I was \"dropped\" and being made to sit at the back away from the top table and especially my husband. You're spot on, there's no good answer sadly.", "You need to tell your husband what he said. You two are married and you don\u2019t need to hide that from him.", "Your feelings are valid.  At my wedding we had our party with their partners, but I've been to several where that wasn't the case.  Sitting so far away after being dropped stings, for sure.\n\nTry approaching it from the long term picture.  First, take care of yourself above all.  Do you want to maintain the friendships after this event?  If so, how will skipping the wedding affect that goal?  If not, can you expect blowback on your husband?  Will he care more about that than your emotions about the day?  Will attending have lasting effects on your mental well-being or will it be a stressful time period that you can move past?"]}
