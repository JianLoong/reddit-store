We'll call my husband Henry and mom Mary. In March 2022 I had a really bad landlord and a falling apart house so Mary offered to take myself, my husband and our son in until we could find another place to live. We paid our portion of bills and contributed to food and household supplies and did the majority of the cleaning. It took way too long for us to find our own place in the area that would let us move with my dog but we did eventually find a place and moved in 3 days ago.

Mary tried to persuade me to give her the sofa and I take her old one. I didn't want to, but she has a way of insisting and going on about things until I agree with her. So I agreed but the day of the move, told her I changed my mind which is what initially sent her into a rage. I know that is a poor way to go about things and I fully accept being called TA for that, and I wish I could really express how bad it would have been if I initially told her no. Mary is a chain smoker and has had her couch for years, it's falling apart and reeks of nicotine. I just did not want it.\n\nBefore Henry and I moved, we paid Mary our portion of the internet for this month and it was fine until the day we moved. Mary changed the password and refused us access to it so I asked my money back and Mary claimed I never paid it for this month. The day after, she put a bunch of garbage onto my front porch and under my back porch. Henry cleaned it all up and I thought that was that. Today I discovered Mary plucked out the sunflowers I had planted in my flower pots, she put more trash under my back porch and is now keeping some things that were packed but Henry and I forgot to grab. In the box are Nintendo Switch Lite, PS Vita and a few games. Mary also stole the ashes of the cat I mentioned earlier.\n\nI think I WBTA if I kept my son away from Mary because they have a close relationship and my son has nothing to do with this I'm only afraid of what she will do to him to get back at me. So far my son has not asked about or for Mary since we moved and I have not talked about her in front of him.\n\nEdit: I'm not good at Reddit and told the mod bot that my explanation for being the AH here is because I don't know why my post won't go up :') ", "created_utc": 1689815895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154cxe5/wibta_for_not_letting_my_mom_see_my_son/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YWBTA. Your son, and getting to see them, is not leverage in negotiation with your mother. Deal with your issues separately. \n\nINFO: I am also confused though. Are you saying you are afraid your mother will harm your son to get revenge on you about the couch? (If yes, then safety first obviously) But you also say they have a close relationship. Also, the person you describe sounds erratic. But you lived with them for over a year? Were you scared or fighting while you lived with them?", "NTA. What you describe as your mother's actions show a mental problem! She truly needs therapy.", "NTA what she\u2019s doing is really petty", "I've done it before but got back in contact with her at the request of my grandpa. Now I'm not sure if I should go NC again or not, especially since we live next door. My mom is a very vile woman.", "INFO: You moved next door to your mom? If so, since your son has a relationship with her how will you manage taking a firm approach on NC?", "You say your son has a close relationship,  but he doesn't ask about her.  I'd say that's not a close relationship and he's obviously not missing her.", "I did yes, we waited a year for this apartment to be vacant because everything was mostly fine then. It wasn't until we moved that my mom started showing her true colors again. I thought that having a grandchild would make her a little more mature, but now I'm not so sure and I have no idea how to be NC at the moment."]}
