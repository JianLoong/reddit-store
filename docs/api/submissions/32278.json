Well we agreed that he would send $100 a week (about $400 a month) because child support would take a lot more and I didn\u2019t want him to be worse off. He kept up on his end of the agreement for about a year consistently well for about the last year I\u2019ve gotten maybe $200, max $300 a month. He asked me last month if he could just send 3 times a month ($300/month) and I said yes, as long as he told me the week before when he was unable to send. He did let me know in advance one time and then just decided he wasn\u2019t going to communicate when he wouldn\u2019t be able to and as much as I know I shouldn\u2019t, I do rely on the money from him as our child is sick a lot which causes me to miss work often. So he has been putting me in a worse financial spot and our child is about to have surgery which will have me off of work for a minimum of 3 weeks. Also i feel like it\u2019s relevant to mention that I am the one to provide all of her Xmas presents. I mentioned this because Xmas is 4 days after her surgery so I would like to make it a good one. Anyway I asked him last week if he would be willing to help me out more while I\u2019m off work and he replied complaining about much he\u2019s struggling. And then proceeded to not tell me he wasn\u2019t able to help this week until this week came I asked what day he could send and then he informed me the day after he was supposed to have sent it that he wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve held off for almost 6 years and I\u2019ve been considering applying for almost a year since he isn\u2019t keeping up on our agreement and I have her full time. I\u2019m finally feeling ready to actually apply but I can\u2019t help but feel bad because I know how expensive life is, but I also feel like I\u2019ve been very lenient.

You've done so well negotiating with BD up to this point, and it sounds like he's committed to doing what he can to offer financial support. \n\nA court order to pay money he doesn't have to offer, no matter how much he wants to, will do great harm to both of you for a very long time. If he cannot pay the court ordered amount, he'll likely lose his license to drive and could possibly be jailed. You already feel like he's struggling financially, so having these things happen to him in addition to his struggles will only reduce his ability to contribute to the child's care: No license + no freedom = no money to contribute and reduced ability to keep gainful employment because of the new record.\n\nMaybe you have the option to ask he or his family to provide the care for your shared daughter, post-surgery, so you won't have to miss so much work? Maybe he could take out a loan and put the money into the child's fund?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Fuck this shit.", "What makes you think that the father wants to take his care of his child? I see a story that describes a person who is completely detached, emotionally and physically, from their child and whose monetary support has been dwindling for a year. A parent who won't help with the cost of a surgery, won't help with the custodial care required because of the surgery, and who won't be providing any gifts to the little girl after the surgery for Christmas. This is what you think of as a caring parent who is committed to financially supporting their child? And, the mother who wants nothing more than to take care of her child, and has done so with minimal support from the father, is an asshole?", "Or it will motivate him to get a better job and support his kid\u2026 clearly he\u2019s an absent father if OP is the one always taking off and taking care of her. \n\nWhat would you have to say if he and OP were still together and no agreement could legally be made? You\u2019d just be ok with him being a deadbeat? Come on. He\u2019s an adult. If he can\u2019t get his shit together to take care of his kid, then jail is where he belongs.\n\nAny parent whose co-parent isn\u2019t contributing is an idiot for not going to court. The child deserves better. If the father here won\u2019t motivate himself, then a court order that garnishes his wages until he\u2019s living off of almost nothing will.", "Then people will have to utilize their critical thinking skills and actually read the comment.", "question: IATA for applying for child support *years after I already should have*\n\nanswer: YTA", "I already stated my opinion and placed my vote. It's right above your comment. Why would you think that I need to conform my opinion to yours?", "Perhaps what you think is true, but I think you're being unrealistic to believe that financial problems can be solved only by threat and force. The OP doesn't accuse BD of being absentee. While he may be just that, it could be that he and the OP decided her providing primary care was best for their child and that he take a more limited role in the child's day-to-day care. It's equally possible that the OP demanded that she be able to provide primary care for the little one and he agreed to let her to avoid upsetting their child. \n\nMany intact couples struggle to pay bills and care for their children throughout all of memorable history. Often times, one earns and contributes more than the other. It's normal. Working through those difficulties and doing what's in the best interest of the child can be extremely frustrating and inconvenient whether a family is intact or separate, but there is no need to involve the courts unless there is abuse in either scenario.", "I agree with the comment, but if the results for OP's actual question is Y T A, she might end up NOT asking for child support while she should in fact ask for back pay.", "I agree that that SHOULD be the question, but it isn't.\n\nOP asks is she is T A **IF** she asks for child support. \n\nIf people start replying to THAT question that she is T A, she'll never apply!", "So to be clear, you think the father should just be able to pay absolutely nothing if he doesn\u2019t want to? And this child should suffer because of it? He had an agreement to pay $400. He accepted that and failed to live up to his obligation. Then he agreed to giving less as long as he gave notice. He failed to do that too. \n\nYou\u2019re making excuses for a man who has a reasonable agreement and is choosing not to adhere to it. Because it\u2019s not just the money, it\u2019s also the notice. \n\nRight now without a threat of force, he\u2019s paying next to nothing and failing to uphold his end of their agreement. At least with a court order, when he continues to fail, he\u2019ll get punished for it. \n\nYou\u2019re essentially saying the kid shouldn\u2019t come first.", "Taking a reasonable situation and trying to resolve it in an unreasonable manner is not in the best interest of the OP, BD or the child.", "Getting the court involved is the only reasonable solution. OP tried to make an agreement outside of court and BD kept reneging on it. What could you possibly point to that suggests that will change?\n\nUnless you think the father should just have no consequences for not taking care of the kid?", "You have not successfully argued or proven that her resolution is unreasonable.", "I would argue that the six previous years of strong communication between these two parents, combined with the payments this man made (regardless of amounts and frequency) to help support this child throughout, are the strongest indications of his commitment to his child. No court can improve on what this OP and her BD have created between them: communication, compromise and compassion. The OP has many options to select from that would be far more effective in achieving their shared goal of providing for the child while their money is tight. \n\nYou suggest that OP's only option is to go to court and get him punished. You would have her cut off her nose to spite her own face in doing so.", "1) One does not just waltz into a courtroom, state their wishes and the judge grants said wishes, then magic money appears in OP's pockets. \n\nThis reality alone is proof that her resolution is not based in sound reasoning.", "If there was strong communication then he would've been giving her notice. He failed to do so. And, you've failed to note that once again. Why do you keep ignoring the fact that he reneged on his word in favor of this assumptive narrative that their communication is strong and that it's all that is necessary for this system to function? Clearly it isn't all that is necessary since the mother is struggling to take care of the child."]}
