I don't mean like because of your gender you should put your foot down or anything jackassy like that, but how are you okay living with someone who's not proud of your relationship?  Its not the 50's anymore where people would care about who's dating who... I would be incredibly hurt if my partner didn't acknowledge who I was to them.   Source: I dated someone 9 years younger than me.  Lived together for a year\nEdit: replaced \"should\" with \"would\"", "NTA - she sounds like she\u2019s treating you as her \u201cdirty little secret\u201d.", "If she's afraid of being judged because of the age differences, she's basically saying she's afraid to acknowledge being in a relationship with you.\n\nTo me, that's not fair to you.\n\nNTA", "Nta. She's either playing the field and knew her friends wouldn't approve or she will forever keep you her dirty little secret. Don't waste more time on something that isn't going anywhere.", "NTA. You deserve someone who would shout from the rooftops that they\u2019re together with you! It\u2019s understandable that you would reach your breaking point after two years. Quite frankly, at 41 years old, she should be more emotionally mature than this in my opinion. Either she commits to you or find someone else that will.", "NTA.\n\nShe should stand up for you and your relationship if she really values it.", "NTA. How does she explain who you are at dinner if she doesn't want people to know you're dating?\n\nDo you really want to stick in a relationship with someone who's ashamed of you still after 2 years?", "NAH but you are wrong. She is single. So are you! You are dating, not married. There's a huge difference. She made it publicly clear that she isn't interested in marriage, just dating and living together. That's her prerogative and her choice. The question is, now that you know this about her, is this something you agree with and also want to just enjoy single life? Are you ok having kids with someone who wants to be a single parent? It sounds like she wants to live as though you are married without actually being married and having the assurances, rights, commitment, and responsibilities of marriage, at least yet.... If you were one of the couples in my marriage coaching classes I would encourage you both to really talk about the future, and what you both need and want, so that you can decide at this point if you're on the same page before continuing.", "NTA...however if she can't face the truth herself after 2 years, what's the future going to consist of? You deserve more than a roommate.", "NTA but you are with her why? If she was ok with the relationship she would not care who knew. How she looks is more important", "NTA but everyone on reddit is too quick to jump to say no contact for family or run from relationships, so I'll give you my advice. It's obviously bad on her and not right to the be so secretive of your relationship after 2 years, but you guys need to talk it out. You said you guys have seriously talked about spending your lives together with marriage and kids, so if you both really love each other, it will hopefully work out.", "INFO: Are you trying to manipulate her into more of a commitment than she's willing to make? Maybe she sees you as a bit of fun and not a LT catch. The fact that she made the point of replying that she enjoys being **SINGLE** should be a clue about her mindset even if you are making assumptions about being a couple.", "NTA.  It seems like you and your girlfriend are in different places and you may want to reevaluate your situation.", "NTA, but I would end that relationship if she\u2019s embarrassed by you.", "NTA. If that were to have happened to me, she would've been single. Not only has she fabricated this lie that she is single, but she's actively denying your relationship's existence, and invalidated you and the things you've done to and for her to make her happy.\n\n\nBy her getting upset that you told them should tell you where her priorities are.", "NTA, ask her what she sees as the future of the relationship.  If she is embarrassed to admit to dating you, is marriage and children really in your future?", "NTA\n\nI'm surprised her own friends aren't telling her she's TA and needs to break up and move along. She is not seriously considering those marriage and children.  As a 40-yo, most of my friends are now talking about having \"aged out\" of having children (for better or for worse, depending on the person).  If your conversations aren't about adopting children, then know she's lying to you even more.\n\nIdk what her deal is. I'm sure she likes you. Perhaps you have $ and you're stable, but she doesn't want commitment.\n\nAnd no one would care about that age gap. Maybe a bit of surprise, but I have friends with 6 to 22 year age gaps with their partners. It's a little curious, but once you get to see how they operate as a couple, most people genuinely are happy for their partner.", "If she's embarrassed of you, leave.", "NTA but it\u2019s fairly obvious you need to reconsider things , if only you and her know you\u2019re together there\u2019s something very wrong there . Hiding your relationship from her circle you\u2019re saying , to what extent ? Just her friends or her friends and family ? Yes people at times keep relationships secret at the beginning for numeral reasons like they don\u2019t announce things until they\u2019re ready , but after two years it\u2019s ridiculous and how will you get married if nobody knows you exist ? I think you need to address a few things there and ask her if she\u2019s ashamed of you and keeping you hidden", "Honestly? Maybe it\u2019s time for her to be single. She appears to be ashamed of you and the relationship because \u201csomeone\u201d might think poorly of her. \n\nNTA. \n\nI, personally, would not remain in a relationship where my live in partner stated they are single. She\u2019s shown you what she thinks of the relationship. Believe her.", "This sounds like a bad relationship. Sounds like you are a toy. NTA but I\u2019d consider Running.", "NTA but are you sure you're in a relationship here? If it's been 2 years and she still won't admit you're together, maybe it's time to move on. You deserve to be with a person who cares about your feelings and is happy to tell others about you.", "NTA\n\nBut it sounds like your partner wants to keep ypur relationship a secret from the people that are important to her.  You sound like you are tired of living in the closet.  You deserve better.  Have that conversation.  If she isnt willing to make a change, determine how long you are willing to stay in that type of arrangement.", "NTA, but she sounds like one. She\u2019s more concerned about judgment from others than your relationship and feelings to the point she invalidated and denied your relationship in public? You deserve better.", "NTA. I can understand keeping a relationship quiet from friends in the early days and even the first few months. That point passed and it became awkward to disclose somewhere around about a year ago.\n\nIt's time for the crunch point and you have made that happen.\n\nTwo things happen from here, she realises that her friends don't care about the age difference in adult relationships, or the relationship ends and you can find someone who respects you.", "Nta and to be honest if she\u2019s still denying your relationship this has no future. Marriage? Kids??!  You gotta be crazy. get out while you still can.", "NTA I'm sorry she hurt your feelings. I can understand wanting to keep things quiet. But the way she handled that was suspicious and hurtful. Not okay. She needs to understand where you're coming from and either commit to the relationship or it will fail.", "NTA\n\nBut I'm like you. I would be much more worried that she didn't admit to dating me than that the secret got out. After two years it's time to put your foot down and have her commit to the relationship or move on.\n\nFace it. You are in the prime of your ability to date at 31 and hopefully financially stable. In theory you could easily pull in a 'hungry' 25 year old. I'm not saying break up with her. But there are plenty of fish out there and you are a big-ole piece of bait.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, she caused this embarrassing situation for both of you by inviting her friends over and you were faced with either keeping up the lie or telling them the truth. Both shitty options.", "NTA and I think you deserve better.", "There is another angle other than age to consider. She's Catholic and Asian. Her friends that night where are catholic and asian. \n\nI'm white and an atheist. Her friends might have a bigger issue with that than me being 10 years younger.", "\"Housemates\"", "This is so fucked up. Single means you aren\u2019t in a relationship of any kind.

First time I\u2019ve ever heard this\u2026", "They live together and share the same bed and likely finances that go into upkeep of the home they share.

I know culture can play into it, but if she is not willing to acknowledge that she is in a relationship with you, then she doesn\u2019t deserve you. This ain\u2019t going to change.

Not sure how anyone can interpret your situation as \"you trying to manipulate her into more of a commitment\" given the information you provided. Also, if you wrote this exact same post but with your genders swapped, the overwhelming reaction would be that she's stringing you along. You might need to have a serious conversation about this because you can't be married/have children in secret. Either she's all in or you might need to move on.", "To be fair, we met as housemates and hit it off from there. We moved out of the last place together and got a house of our own."]}
