Cats regularly acquire names that aren't on their vet certificate.", "I think the people voting N-T-A are not considering the fact that the cleverness of the name is not the issue. Your stepdaughter is a young child. She presumably loves the cat. You are rubbing it in her face that the cat almost got run over, and even that it could happen again. That is upsetting to a child.

That bird either had a death wish or was just incredibly stupid. She ended up living a very long chicken life in spite of this. (7 years) She never did become cat food.", "My Ma once tried to rescue three dogs loose on the highway. She was only able to get one in the car before the other two became grease stains. \n\nShe named him Solo because he was the lone survivor.", "NAH. As a certified Cat Person and a Registered Veterinary Technician I say \"anything goes for naming cats, except for slurs.\" My colleagues and I would find Speed Bump's name and backstop absolutely hilarious. You rescued him, so you clearly didn't WANT him to become a real speed bump. So you aren't an asshole for the name.\n\nBut neither are your wife and step-daughter assholes for finding the name to be in poor taste. Especially since she is only 8 years old, which is a little young for dark humor to have developed. \n\nBecause he is already registered under the name, my suggestion is a nickname for you to use at home. Maybe Speedy? I had a cat named B\u00eate Noire, but we always just called her Betty. My current cat's earliest vet records are under Barney Stinson Jr, but he has always been Swarley. Call it the Racehorse Method.", "NAH. I understand the humour towards the cat name. Its definitely not to my tastes, but its not my call. Not everyone likes dark humour. \n\nBut shes also 8. Shes going to have a completely different outlook on the whole situation. At 8 I would definitely have the very same reaction. To an 8 yesr old this is mean and she feels for a small cat who was in a scary situation. This is how kid brains can work.", "Inappropriate, but \u201cSpeed Bump\u201d is better than \u201cFlat Mate\u201d. NTA.", "YTA but good job at saving the kitten.", "I chuckled too but the kid is just eight, ffs. If this isn\u2019t her sense of humor stop pushing it and upsetting her.", "YTA as an adult I can find the humor in the name an eight year old tho really she\u2019s eight and loves this cat and you picked a name that\u2019s dark humor not cool", "Never name a pet Lucky. One way ticket to expensive problems.", "OP doesn\u2019t say the cat is an indoor-only kitty.  I wonder if the name will still be hilarious if the cat actually gets run over in future?

Every time she says his name, she\u2019ll think of a cat getting run over", "Exactly, it's disgustingly immature and shows a lack of empathy. The kitten deserves a better name and the girl a step father that is not an asshole. \n\nYTA.", "LMFAOOOOO", "It's a nine week old kitten, so I assumed indoor (at least for now).  But, how the cat eventually dies has no bearing on whether or not I find the name and the origin of the name to be funny.  Humor is subjective.", "Same.

I get the dark humor but dang, that's usually directed towards people more mature than 8.", "Named after the cat in mortal instruments?

But I am an adult with a very dark sense of humour.", "YTA but funny.\n\nJust find a sensible name for the cat.  Let your daughter name him.", "YTA. Your step daughter is 8!! Thinking about her kitty getting run over is very scary for her. That\u2019s like telling your kid there are monsters under her bed, then laughing about it. Way to bully a child.", "I don't care about the name. Its the fact the little girl cried about it and you kept antagonizing her. Just let her pick a name for the kitten ffs. YTA", "YTA. The name is obviously traumatizing your stepdaughter and it\u2019s in poor taste. I love dark humor as much as the next person but this went too far. Here\u2019s some other options for the cat: Lucky, Fluffy, Cole, Smokey, Leo, etc. Some LESS TRAUMATIC NAMES.", "NTA that\u2019s hilarious and quite clever. Points for originality", "My heart wants to go with NAH, but you admitted you were pushing into the territory, so I\u2019ll have to go with an ever-so-slight YTA.\n\nTell her you\u2019re amazed at how fast the cat runs, call \u2018em Speedy, and hope she doesn\u2019t catch on until she\u2019s at least 12. Otherwise, that cat\u2019ll be doomed to be called Fluffy or Whiskers.", "YTA\n\nYeah, joke two definitely showed you to be an AH", "YTA. Know your audience.  Did you forget you would be sharing this cat with your step daughter? While most teens and adults would see the humor in Speed Bump or Skid Mark, I doubt many 8 year old girls would be amused.", "While I find it funny because I love dark humor, YTA for not responding appropriately to your daughter. And I'm kinda surprised you didn't know that this would bother your daughter. My daughter is 5 and I could never do something like this because it would be very upsetting to her. Let your daughter find a new name. She'll be thrilled.", "As someone who went to school with a boy nicknamed \u2018Speed Hump\u2019 (Speedie for short) because he\u2019d been hit by a bus\u2026twice(!!)\u2026I think the name is hilarious but YTA for pushing it with an 8yr old. Even more so for the second suggestion. Yes they need to learn the world is not all sunshine and lollipops but a family pet\u2019s name is probably not the place to introduce gallows humour to a kid. \n\nChange the name, but know that you gave this reader a good chuckle.", "At least he isn't named Road Kill.

I can see why your step-daughter is upset though. NAH.", "NTA. You rescued the cat so you can name him whatever you want.", "NTA. Your stepdaughter is overreacting and wife is indulging the drama needlessly. When I was around her age, we had pet chickens named after chicken-based dishes (e.g,, Kiev, Parmesan, etc.). None of us were scarred by it. \n\nAnd realistically, who calls a cat by its name anyway. That's just a jumping off point for the 60 or so nicknames you're gonna give it.", "NAH. I find the name hilarious. My aunt named has a cat named Zero cause he had zero chance at living, but did. My mom named a cat Siren cause she found him screaming outside and then he screamed in our house. I would absolutely do the same thing\n\nBut the kid is 8. It\u2019s fair she doesn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like thinking of my pets dying so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s terrible for a kid. You could try to spin it with Speedy as a nickname for his speedy rescue/recovery or for how fast he is.

I know very few cats that actually get called by their full names anyway. She\u2019ll get used to calling the cat bumpy or speedy or something along those lines and completely forget about the emotional outburst. I\u2019ll edit this comment when I get to ask my 8 year old niece what she thinks later today.", "Brilliant.. I\u2019d give you an award if I had any!", "Definitely not lucky, every cat i have known of called lucky had died from some sort of accident or attack by another animal.

Im in my thirties, grew up in a hunting family and I find this distasteful.", "Doesn\u2019t matter if she hadn\u2019t met the cat, now every time she hears its name she\u2019ll be reminded of what happened.
