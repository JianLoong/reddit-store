Cats regularly acquire names that aren't on their vet certificate.", "I think the people voting N-T-A are not considering the fact that the cleverness of the name is not the issue. Your stepdaughter is a young child. She presumably loves the cat. You are rubbing it in her face that the cat almost got run over, and even that it could happen again. That is upsetting to a child.
