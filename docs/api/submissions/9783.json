You've never been to one which is why you think it's an unregulated free-for-all WEED STORE. \n\nAlso, is he on IEP at all? Most kids don't *voluntarily* stay in school past 18. Maybe give him some credit there. He doesn't have to be there. You clearly have a bias against this student. \n\nPeople like you are proof that Christians are hypocritical trash.

How many kids do you teach that have medications that help them. Since he went through the process to get medical approval you need to accept that this is an accommodation.\n\nNow this is the important part - if he is not able to do the work - that and only that is the reason why he should be successful or not. \n\nAdding the extra stuff is making it about you and not him.", "I agree with your conditions except the being high.

Just don't expect him to fully quit (he probably is addicted and withdrawal isn't cool, especially when there's other factors like social anxiety)", "I think you handled it well. You were firm but compassionate and gave him a chance to earn his diploma. It was fair of you to set ground rules and make it clear that if he doesn't follow them, he won't get the diploma. Good on you for not letting him off the hook!", "YTA Jesus would have more compassion. Have you even tried to understand his home life or what he is struggling with? This is why our state\u2019s school systems are so awful. Oklahoma only allows weed medically. You are preventing him from taking a medication. I hope he figures it out and takes legal action. I bet a ton of your students are on antidepressants, pain meds, and other meds that have side affects. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t mind all the students on stimulants. Your other criteria is ridiculous different than other high school students have. It\u2019s dumb to make it harder for him bc it\u2019s his third time. Just keep your class rules the same.", "YTA, your lucky this kid is probably not smart enough to sue for discrimination. If his MJ is prescription you are saying he cant come to class after taking his prescribed meds. Thats discrimination!\n\n Also, he obviously has problems and if you failing him in this one class prevents him from getting a diploma then you are doing youre whole community a disservice. I think you know the future of someone without a diploma.  \nHim coming to class drowsy and glassy eyed hurts no one. \n\nGet off your high horse do your job as an educator and teach this kid to the point of passing.  No hes not the next Steve Jobs, but you dont need to make him jobless.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t understand why anyone else should give the slightest shit about your conservative beliefs so long as he is following the law and not insulting others.", "NTA but you should have a look where his problems come from. I also once was a problem student (but without the drugs lol) I just had problems at home (My mother is very abusive) Probably he also has problems at home. The really shitty thing here is: as his teacher you can't do much about it. If problems at home really are his problem he would need a safe environment to learn better. And he would of course have to stop doing drugs. You can't really do anything but ask him how you could help.", "YTA. you cannot fail him for smoking weed. you can fail him for not completing assignments, doing poorly on tests, etc., but not for smoking weed. if he\u2019s consistently sleeping in class because he\u2019s too high, that\u2019s his problem, not yours, but it\u2019s absolutely not your place to police what he does outside of school/your classroom. also, i guarantee he isn\u2019t the only student in your class who shows up high. you teach seniors in high school ffs", "\"*OK so I (35f), am a fairly conservative woman living in Oklahoma.I am a Christian, and teach seniors in highschool*.\"\n\nNONE OF THAT MATTERS, and you seem to forget that as a Christian, you should forgive the sinner, and help those in need, instead of coming in high on your horse looking down on people. It IS awesome that you have faith, but less so that you use that to push a agenda of your own top a student who's in trouble.Just admit that you can't, because of personal difficulties, and give him his passing grade, and have it done. *You had him for three years, you should have known that this is not about him being high, it's about his anxiety, and how you have handled it.*\n\n**The road to salvation is within you, be better, don't judge unless you want to be judged just as harshly.**  \n\n\nYTA. Do better.", "NAH. I see what you're trying to do, an your going beyond what can be expected of a teacher by actually caring about this guy.

You should be giving him some extra study materials and expecting him to do his learning more on his own time and not be so hung up on it being done in class.  Those are reasonable accomodations.\n\nSocial anxiety is no joke.  I had a relative try to kill herself over it.
