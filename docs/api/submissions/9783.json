Good on you for not letting him off the hook!", "YTA Jesus would have more compassion. Have you even tried to understand his home life or what he is struggling with? This is why our state\u2019s school systems are so awful. Oklahoma only allows weed medically. You are preventing him from taking a medication. I hope he figures it out and takes legal action. I bet a ton of your students are on antidepressants, pain meds, and other meds that have side affects. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t mind all the students on stimulants. Your other criteria is ridiculous different than other high school students have. It\u2019s dumb to make it harder for him bc it\u2019s his third time. Just keep your class rules the same.", "YTA, your lucky this kid is probably not smart enough to sue for discrimination. If his MJ is prescription you are saying he cant come to class after taking his prescribed meds. Thats discrimination!\n\n Also, he obviously has problems and if you failing him in this one class prevents him from getting a diploma then you are doing youre whole community a disservice.

I also once was a problem student (but without the drugs lol) I just had problems at home (My mother is very abusive) Probably he also has problems at home. The really shitty thing here is: as his teacher you can't do much about it. If problems at home really are his problem he would need a safe environment to learn better.

There's a clear hierarchy, a clear set of rules and policies, and a carefully curated lesson curriculum. You'll be able to see where things would be better. You'll see smart ppl fail.

That\u2019s where the similarities end. YTA for so many reasons. Let me explain:\n\n1. You\u2019re not doing your job a a teacher. You say you\u2019ve had this student for three years, but you mention nothing about him as a person. What\u2019s going on in his life? Is he using marijuana as an escape from something? Is his home life difficult? Is he part of the LGBTQ community and can\u2019t come out due to your general *conservative* (aka bigoted) views in Oklahoma? That\u2019s part of your job, to find out what the real issues are and meet the student where he is, not stand in judgment of him. \n\n2. You\u2019re also being the type of Christian who gives all of us a bad reputation. If you\u2019re really trying to live a Christ-like life, you wouldn\u2019t be judging this young man, but trying to help him. Remember, Christ himself spent his time with those who were the outcasts of the society of the time, lepers, prostitutes, even Matthew, a Jewish tax collector for the Romans. You\u2019re calling yourself a Christian, but aren\u2019t trying to live like one.\n\nI\u2019m really trying to not judge you as a person, but only look at your actions, and I admit, it\u2019s difficult. Look, I get it. It\u2019s hard as a teacher when we want what\u2019s best for a student more than they do themselves. When that happens, it\u2019s important to remember it\u2019s *our job* to get to the root cause and work with that kid, not to punish. As a Christian teacher, it\u2019s not in my faith to judge, but to interact with people from a place of love and compassion.

Normally, GPA is for the whole year across all classes or even cumulative. \n\nIs a D considered \u201cpassing\u201d? If I\u2019m understanding correctly, a high school student has to retake EVERY class if their GPA for the year was too low, not just the ones they failed.
