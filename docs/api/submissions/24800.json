I also told her to call me back if she had 0 options. She said \u201cok\u201d and hung up. About an hour later I received a text from her stating that she was very upset that I couldn\u2019t help her in her time in need, and also decided to tell me that I\u2019m \u201cnever available\u201d and will be sure to never ask a favor from me again.

She expected you to give up your weekend time with your actual GF at the drop of a hat because she  didn't plan ahead. She could get a cab, an Uber, or other.  Instead of spending her own money, she demanded that you give up your weekend time with your GF. \n\nF that!

Most functioning adults can make their own way to and from an airport.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nShe does realize she's your ex right? Rofl", "There's so much stuff wrong here... First and most important, being friends doesn't mean doing favors for them. Secondly, you had a good reason to not be available and didn't completely rule out helping. \n\nShe either wanted you specifically to be there AND/OR she was offended that your gf was the reason for you not coming. I don't think she's really your friend. NTA.", "I think you\u2019re both better off not talking. Nta", "NTA Why call you when she could of gotten a taxi, Uber, Lyft or a shuttle?! All those are services she can get at the airport. \nBut I also don\u2019t understand how she feels so comfortable calling you for a ride, knowing you\u2019re in a relationship.", "NTA \n\nShe is your ex and you were already engaged in your plans with your girlfriend. \n\nNow I have to caution you to be careful into giving her any false hope of being there for your ex. Don\u2019t commit to her anymore.", "NTA\n\nYou were given no advance notice that she needed a ride.\n\nShe asked last minute and you were unavailable.\n\nDon't let her make you feel bad about it.  She had other options to get home from the airport.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA. Nobody needs friends like that", "NTA fuck her, she is your EX gf, you don't owe her shit.", "NTA. You absolutely did the right thing. You were already with someone and had plans. I would venture to say your girlfriend would\u2019ve been upset if you ran off to pick someone up from the airport unless it was truly an emergency situation. BTW, who calls you at the last minute and says, can you pick me up from the airport? Friends don\u2019t do that, they make plans with you well in advance if they need that type of a favor. Your ex needs to understand that she is no longer your priority and friends don\u2019t make unreasonable demands from friends.", "Definitely NTA, she is no longer your girlfriend and you really shouldn't feel bad for prioritizing your new girl over her.\n\nI think your ex might still have some feelings towards you, she used the picking up from airport as an excuse to see you, hoping you two might get back together. Seems that this is not the first time she has done something like that and she is pissed it didn't worked the way she expected.", "NTA\n\nQuestion OP, how did you and this girl break it off? Because this reads it wasn't about the ride at all, seems like an excuse just to see you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's time to cut the chord on this one and move on.", "And that's why she's an EX.", "NTA. She just got to the airport and,,,what? No plans?  Isn't the normal thing to do is to have a plan? A limo, Uber, friend already set up?  Get in the taxi line?   How often does she expect favors last minute? How often does she do favors for you?", "NTA.\n\nA friendship isn't measured by a person's response to a no-notice 8 am phone call asking for a ride from the airport.\n\nGrown-ass people figure out their transportation beforehand.", "NTA.", "Was this a last minute flight to get to some emergency?  And even if you are still friends with your ex, are they really your first call when you need something?  \n\nI\u2019m going to go with NTA because it seems like she was trying to set you up. I don\u2019t travel often but the logical question is always how you are getting to and from the airport at both ends of the flight.   The only reason I can see this happening for most people would be emergency flight, first flight out within an hour or two of finding out you need to go, and it being too early to call people and your ex is the only person you know that wakes up early.  But even then for an emergency you would think whoever called you would have someone meeting you when your flight arrived.", "That's what's so weird! Even if this story took place 10 years ago, she could still have called a cab! Why phone a friend for that?", "We broke it off two years ago because she told me her love ebbs and flows when I asked if she truly loved me. We had intimacy issues that tore me apart, felt like I was always chasing her to be my lover only to frequently be denied and this also made her feel guilty. We broke up the next weekend, but remained very close friends after the dust settled. She also currently has a boyfriend.", "We\u2019ve been friends almost 2 years since the breakup. It\u2019s been a healthy friendship and honestly I never considered doing that until now.", "Honestly never. We hangout for food and drinks maybe once every 4-5 months. It\u2019s always on me, even if one of her friends tag along. Knowing this is also what upset me after she told me that I don\u2019t show up for her\u2026 like cmon girl snap back into it :(", "Yeah man that's a bit weird then, especially since she has a boyfriend. \n\nMaybe she  had a shock when you rejected her and said no? Seems like she held a lot of the power previously, and now she's trying to creep back, but you've moved on with a new girl. Guess she doesn't have the power over you she probably thought she had.", "Why didn't she ask her current boyfriend? If she told you the reason.", "Always on you.  Doesn't that say something?", "Neither of them live here. Odds are he wasn\u2019t in town. I\u2019m assuming that she was here to visit her mother.", "NTA-it sounds like she is a habitual favor requester, no one signs up for that.  She did not work things out in advance and you already had plans.  Nothing to feel guilty about.", "Ex girlfriend nuff said", "Airport pick ups are for family, partners/spouses and best friends (depending on how hard it is to drive to the airport). She is none of those and she rudely called you last minute to do it. \n\nShe doesn't get boyfriend privileges anymore because you're not her boyfriend.", "At 8am in the morning on a weekend!", "I have no context on why she was in town. She has a lot of friends so I\u2019d assume I wasn\u2019t her first call.", "NTA. But maybe reevaluate this friendship. Seems like she likes having you in the background when she needs support regardless of your own situation. It may not be intentional but it may not be healthy for you either"]}
