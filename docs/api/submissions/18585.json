She spent time gently but firmly stopping Helen from her food stealing and tantrums and it was later discovered that not only could Helen learn, she was very intelligent and just needed guidance to being able to communicate.\n\nThis child is also capable of learning. The mother is coddling him to the point where she is turning him into an unmanageable person and it will bite her (and this poor kid) in the ass as he grows up and no one wants to be around them. She needs to step up and work with her kid (and hire others to help if she's too overwhelmed herself) instead of lashing out at others for her lack of real involvement with her kid's development.

Autism is not an excuse for poor behaviour.", "NTA\n\nWhile neurotypical people learn how to behave in social situations from other peoples social clues, the autistic people must be taught by their caretakers, because the part of their brain that recognizes social clues doesn't work the way neurotypical people's do.

It's a sad fact that parents like her are partly responsible for negative stereotypes about autistic people. Specifically, that autistic people are selfish and basically narcissistic. Autistic kids don't pick up social skills intuitively.

Kudos to you for speaking up, I know it may not have been good timing, or reactive, but I hate people touching my food too\u2026 with a passion, so I would speak up right away too. In my opinion, your verbal response to his actions seemed pretty appropriate. \n\nI used to be an overly protective parent to an autistic kiddo just like her, but I quickly learned that I was further disabling their ability to learn and grow and doing a great disservice to them by being like that.

I'm a counsellor that works with children, quite a few are on the Austism Spectrum, and teaching them about respecting boundaries is something I do a lot in therapy. Your approach of setting a firm boundary, offering a compromise (if applicable), explaining the reason for the boundary and how it affects other people, and then later affirming that you are not upset with him, is the same approach I take in therapy with my child clients.

I would never allow my daughter to do this to anyone and I have ADHD with suspected OCD traits as per my psych so not just throwing ocd around, it would severely bother me if anyone grabbed food off my plate with their hands.

One day at lunch he was being particularly obnoxious, and when he got told to shut up he made the mistake of saying he didn't know better because of Aspberger's in front of a quiet, well-liked kid who nobody knew also had Aspberger's. Quiet kid absolutely went off on the little shit, \"You can't just use that as a fucking excuse! People like you give all of us a bad name! I work hard every day to not be an obnoxious bastard, why can't you?\" Kept going on like that for like 10 minutes, even bringing up that he didn't think his mom should be a special ed teacher given how she raised him.

I worked in a video game store (family owned not a chain) and there was one older kid that came in that was slow, and he was big all around, way bigger than me, and any time he caught me when I wasn't behind the counter, he came up and forcefully hugged me. One day I was alone in the store and had just walked out from the counter across the room when he walked in the door. I dreaded what was to come.
