Kudos to you for speaking up, I know it may not have been good timing, or reactive, but I hate people touching my food too\u2026 with a passion, so I would speak up right away too. In my opinion, your verbal response to his actions seemed pretty appropriate. \n\nI used to be an overly protective parent to an autistic kiddo just like her, but I quickly learned that I was further disabling their ability to learn and grow and doing a great disservice to them by being like that.

I'm a counsellor that works with children, quite a few are on the Austism Spectrum, and teaching them about respecting boundaries is something I do a lot in therapy.

I hope for Jim\u2019s sake that more adults in his life teach him how to act in public so he doesn\u2019t grow into an adult doing embarrassing things like this when people will be less forgiving.", "NTA - his family and friends treating him like this is far more ableist than anything you did. Autistic people are zoo animals incapable of appropriate behavior, and just like if he was neurotypical, letting bad behaviors go uncorrected is essentially setting him up for failure in life. At what point will she start addressing this behavior? He can\u2019t do this in a context where his mom isn\u2019t in control, does she expect him to never leave her sight? \n\nIt\u2019s also just beyond unreasonable to have not told you before hand \u201coh btw my son will grab food off your plate with his bare hands\u201d. That\u2019s not a reasonable thing to foist onto someone at dinner.", "I have many family members with autism and this is not behavior that should be swept under the rug. Neurodivergency aside, your food is your food and you\u2019re allowed to say who can touch your plate. NTA.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry just downright disgusting that she would let him do that!! Think of all the things the kid could catch from strangers! People learned nothing from the panini\u2026..", "NTA.  Mom is an enabler and not setting up her child for success as an adult.  You were probably the best role model that Jim has had in a long time.", "NTA. I worked for years with people with Austism. Most at a none verbal low understanding level. Stuff like this is still not acceptable. Everyone is capable of learning and boundaries need to be set and reinforced. She is setting that boy up for failure in the future and actually doing him a disservice.", "NTA. A toddler in my family used to do this. I refused to let him put his grubby hands in my food. It's so gross. \n\nIf your friend's child is old enough to get that you're upset, he's old enough to learn to keep his hands to himself.", "Nta!  Even her husband is on your side.", "Dude, even his FATHER agrees with you. No doubt he has tried himself in the past and Anna has not allowed him to. Sounds like he\u2019s thankful for the outside help. NTA.", "Reminds me of Helen Keller in The Miracle Worker.", "NTA even Anna\u2019s husband agrees with OP. Very telling", "Reminds me of Helen Keller before Annie Sullivan came into her life, and the description of the first meal together (Ms Sullivan stopped Helen from taking food off her plate). \n\nNTA", "NTA, and I have been teaching special education for 17 years. Every spectrum, from K-12. Non-verbal to high-functioning. This sounds horrible to say, but it's true; if you can teach your pet to not grab food from your table or plate, you can teach your child not to do it. There is no excuse. None. Even toddlers learn to sit at the table and use utensils to eat their food, and not *grab*, especially from another plate. If Jim is cognizant enough to ask if you were upset with him, he is cognizant enough to learn to stop \"grazing\" from others' plates. Mom needs to step it up and teach him. ASD level 1, you said? Absolutely no excuse, and you 100% were correct in not allowing him to snatch food from your plate.", "NTA I love how people say \"Treat them like you would any other chimd\" then get pissy when you do just that.", "NTA. Parents like this are a nightmare. They refuse to discipline their children, which turns them into absolute little monsters, and then they can't understand why no one wants to be around them. No one wants to put up with an uncontrolled brat, autistic or not.", "Nta that\u2019s downright gross I probably would have thrown a fit", "Hell, it doesn't even sound like the kid was bothered. Confused? Certainly. But less because he's incapable of understanding and more because his mom stops people from helping him understand.", "Even the dad is on OP's side!", "Same. It all leads back to infantalization and its at best fucking annoying but imagine how the kid will feel when he gets older and learns from peers not to do it? He\u2019ll be fucking humiliated and wonder why his mom let him. She\u2019s setting him up for failure", "Right? Like give the kid some fucking credit! \nComing from an autistic mom with an autistic kid", "Yes. By teaching him table manners Jim will be more accepted and more welcome at future dinners and that\u2019s important for the rest of Jim\u2019s life. It\u2019s even okay to ask if you can try something and then wait for a response. But. It just put your hand in someone\u2019s food.", "To be fair the functioning of people with autism can vary greatly and I\u2019m not sure what \u201clevel 1\u201d means \u2014 there may be a possibility it will cause the kid to break down, however this is definitely not the case and so weird of the parents\n\n- sibling of low functioning person w autism :)", "Bro the username \ud83d\ude02", "Whenever I've heard it used to try to excuse generally shitty behavior I just tell them- \"sure, so am I and you're **still** acting like a clown shoe.\"", "Exactly the excuse won't hold up it court if an autistic person can't be told no and for that reason hurts someone.", "I am ASD level 2, and I certainly learned that kind of stuff!", "Rubbish. Being deaf is a perfect excuse for not hearing.", "Not even the \"property\" part. Imagine Jim goes to a buffet style restaurant? Though the buffet is not \"mine\" id be pissed he put his dirty hands in all the dishes to \"try each out\"", "Someday the school nurse is going to call to say Jim has a puncture wound on his hand because a different kid who is ALSO asd and also wasn\u2019t taught boundaries decided to put a fork in his hand for touching his food and this mom is going to have no idea how this could happen!", "\ud83d\ude02", "No its solely Anna.  Read the end... even Anna's HUSBAND thinks OP is NTA", "They know exactly what they are doing. People that advertise their kids autism do it because they don't want to have to parent their kids.", "Considering he is going to a plate putting his hands in it and then eating the food then going to the next plate his hands are not hygienic. Plus if he has any type of bug and not showing symptoms he just exposed everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s like letting him lick his finger and stick it in your salad.", "You sound like a smart caring mom who's children will be able to get by in life without extra issues pulling them down", "My daughter had a neuro-psych evaluation at a prominent children\u2019s hospital where they absolutely did give her a level 1 ASD diagnosis. While it may not be a term that is universally used, it is still used in the medical field.", "Exactly. No kid is going to know, automatically, that it's not okay to touch other people's food. They need to be taught. \n\nMy best friend has a special needs kid. He's awesome, smart as hell. But some people look at him like he's dumb as a rock. They just assume he's incapable of understanding. It's really freaking annoying. \n\nAnyway, I used to volunteer at his school. There were, generally speaking, two types of mothers there. One, the kind that strived to give their kids as much enrichment as possible. The other, who just treated their kids like forever infants. They didn't try to teach them, and when they came to pick them up and one of the teachers showed off a new skill, they looked offended. Like it broke their perception of their \"forever baby.\" \n\nStill gives me the ick thinking about it. I'm not saying this kids parent is exactly like that, but he's 11. He's old enough to be taught boundaries, and there's a way to do it effectively.", "Honestly, this sounds like Mom decided that because he was autistic he was entitled to whatever he wanted whenever he wanted and raised him accordingly. Autistic people are not wild animals incapable of learning proper behavior.", "Sounds like even though dad has a problem with it, mom is telling him that \"it's just our boy, he can't help it, and everyone should let it go\". \n\nThis is the same thing as even if the kid wasn't autistic and the parents don't want to enforce boundaries. It's horrible for the kid because they're going to have a rude awakening later in life because they were never taught that there are rules that everyone have to follow.", "I agree, but OP didn't say he melted down, she said he looked confused. \n\nBut also, hear me out. If a child is that severely impaired, I think it's prudent for the parents to not have him at meals where there are people outside the family present OR give guests a heads up, so that they can at least make an informed choice. \n\nThe mom in this situation seemed to expect that OP would be okay with this and that's just a really bizarre way to handle this situation.", "The kid has the mildest form of autism.

I mention this because I learned things like not eating off of other people's plates when I was that kid's age. If I could learn it then he can learn it.", "Touch\u00e9\n\nBut we both know that\u2019s not what I meant\u2026", "What  did you say?", "Being deaf is not an excuse for not communicating in an alternate way or for behaving inappropriately. Taking good off of peoples plates is not acceptable unless it\u2019s very close casual family.", "I would concur with this.", "This put a lot of what I was thinking into words. Obviously every kid is different and every situation is different, but it's obvious that the mom is doing nothing to help her kid and help him grow and learn. She needs to stop infantilizing him and actually be a mom to him and help him learn from experiences like this for the future. The fact that people are also siding with OP is really telling (especially the husband/father!)", "he's not\n\nhttps://www.verywellhealth.com/what-are-the-three-levels-of-autism-260233", "Very true OP is definitely TA and that\u2019s a good point about how a child with that level of need wouldn\u2019t be put in that situation", "Even close family. You try take my food, you will lose a finger.\n\nYou have been warned.", "I\u2019m on the spectrum and I would have been horrified as a child to even touch food that was exposed to someone else\u2019s saliva", "I agree, I thought maybe the husband was relieved someone else spoke up, he possibly has been trying to step in b4 and bn shut down"]}
