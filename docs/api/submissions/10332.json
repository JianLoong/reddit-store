I've always been a busy person, but I've tried my best to be present in my son's life so he doesn't miss a father.

L\u00edvia has a 19-year-old daughter who is currently taking a gap year before going to university. This month my son left home to go to college. As he is now a grown man, I decided to fire Maria, but I threw a surprise farewell party and announced to her that I was going to be giving her a certain amount of money. In total it would be enough for her to pay for her children's college expenses (they were accepted to public colleges in her country) and not to have to work anymore. \nThe problem started when my wife started complaining that I was paying college for a \"stranger's\" children but not her daughter's.

You gave her a cash bonus when her employment was no longer needed since your son is grown. What she spends that money on is her business.  Your step-daughter did not come into your life until she was already an adult. At this point she is really too old for a step-parent, you are her mother\u2019s husband.

At that point the line between employee and family member is blurred.  And while she may be an employee, I'm sure you and your son both think of her as a member of the family.  \n\nI'm just a random asshole on the Innertubez and even I can see how much Maria and her kids meant to you.  What you did for her was very kind, and that should not ever be held against you.  \n\nLivia however seems to regard Maria as little more than hired help; not a family member; a disposable person.

However you are in a position to provide for daughter, so I don't see why we are talking about this.  I put my son through college, you put your daughter through college.  What's the problem?

Quick question, is Livia also contributing financially to your son\u2019s college fees, because you\u2019re both in a position to cater for each kid. So if you\u2019re expected to pay towards her daughter, is she also paying towards your son? And Livia has completely disregarded the role Maria played in your son\u2019s life, she\u2019s literally been there his entire life. Seeing how she has no empathy towards Maria and her role in your life, be thankful you didn\u2019t meet her when your son was younger.

Had you raised her daughter since she was 11 or 12, maybe.  But not a grown up.
