She should have referred you out to a different therapist. With that being said the fact that she even talked with your parents about your treatment is wrong and breaks confidentiality. \n\nOn the topic of what you discuss you were not at all in the wrong and what your parents are doing is borderline abusive. You talked *in confidence* about your situation with your family (whatever that may be) and they shouldn't be punishing you for it whatsoever. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this right now.", "NTA. Holy shit. The therapist is wrong. Your parents are wrong. Your sister's are wrong. You are not wrong. I have no advice for you because you're young and need their financial help to get a therapist. Do read your therapist the riot act! They are not allowed to share what you say with anyone. if I were you, I would talk to a school counselor and try to get a referral for a different therapist. If you have no money? Ask them if they can take you on pro bono. Advocate for yourself. Because the boundary crossing here is problematic as hell.. And good luck. It's not you.", "NTA, but your parents are huge ones and the therapist should be reported for breach of confidentiality. I sent my daughter to therapy for help with her anxiety and I fully expected she would use that time to vent some. And the therapist gave us some tips on communication and some things we could do to help ease her anxiety and I listened because I love my daughter and care about her. I\u2019m so sorry your parents are like this. It seems they think they can do no wrong and don\u2019t want to listen to you. I\u2019m so sorry,", "NTA. You should be free to talk about whatever you want at therapy. Your therapist shouldn't be saying anything to your parents", "Please talk to a counselor at school and tell them what happened.  You are entitled to safe, confidential therapy.", "NTA \nIt was a clear conflict of interest from the start as the therapist is friends with your parents. There is information your therapist is required to disclose to your parents but this sounds more like they were hanging out as friends and your therapist violated the confidentiality agreement. This is not ethnical and really should be reported.", "NTA your therapist isnt supposed to disclose anything about their clients unless they are going to harm themselves or others. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: skimmed it and missed the part where theyre friends, even more NTA your parents suck so much im sorry", "Your parents are friends with your therapist?! That\u2019s called dual relationship and that therapist should not have agreed to see you for this very reason. NTA and I\u2019m sorry you had this experience for many reasons but not least because I\u2019m sure this betrayed your trust in the whole endeavor. Therapy is supposed to be a safe space for you to talk about anything and your therapist should have been way more careful and ethical.", "NTA. Therapy should be a safe place to talk about anything you need to. That therapist is violating your rights. Therapists can\u2019t talk about anything that happened during a session unless the client is in immediate danger. I\u2019m so sorry this happened and I hope you can get a better therapist eventually.", "Therapist was in the wrong. It was not professional. This person is not someone you can now feel safe talking to. Parent\u2019s reaction validates your need to discuss them.", "NTA - Is there someone who can advocate for you? Or a school counselor? It can be hard to see when you're young and growing up in a controlling household but you are allowed to talk about your experiences and anyone trying to deny them is not on your side. You are allowed your thoughts and you are allowed to share them with your therapist.", "NTA.  80% of therapy is unpacking and unlearning things you experienced and learned in your childhood.  It\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid talking about your parents.  But your therapist potentially violated HIPAA when he or she had a conversation with your parents about one of your sessions.  That should never have happened.  You have to be able to trust your therapist, and that was a pretty serious violation of trust.  I\u2019m sorry it resulted in you being pulled out of therapy but you deserve a better therapist.", "NTA. \n\nYour therapist violated confidentiality by disclosing that to them, and that extremely unprofessional. For me, that would be grounds for a new therapist (I understand that isn\u2019t possible here).\n\nIf discussing your parents in therapy make you an AH, then everyone in therapy is an AH. At 42, I STILL talk about mine in therapy.", "NTA. Not only should you be able to feel free to talk to your therapist about anything in an environment of trust for the effectiveness of the therapy, you are legally entitled to it. File a complaint with your state's licensing board. This is not a small matter.\n\nAdditionally, your parents denying you medical attention (which this is) and/or adding conditions for you to receive it should be reported to DCFS/CPS. I know you might not feel like trusting adults right now, but consider going to a counselor at school for help to advocate for you.\n\nLastly, I cannot overstate the size of the red flag your parents were flying when they told you not to talk about them in therapy. Why? Were they concerned you would reveal mistreatment? Sure sounds like it.", "NTA- Your therapist should have never agreed to work with you due to a conflict of interest (Being friends with your parent). That's against the ethical codes that therapists are held to uphold. Depending on what the therapist shared with your parents, that's also a breach of your confidentiality (even as a minor). Is there any way that you could reach out to a teacher at your school or a school counselor (preferably) who can advocate on your behalf?  \n\n\nIt's a rough world already, and it's even tougher when your immediate family isn't helpful. I'm so sorry you're going through this and I hope you get the support that you need/have someone in your corner!", "NTA, please tell all of this to a school counselor. Nothing you talk about in therapy should have been leaked to your parents unless your life was in danger. The therapist also needs a complaint filed against them for breach of ethics.", "NTA.  Is there a school counselor you can talk to?  Your therapist grossly violated patient confidentiality and your parents are being abusive.", "NTA. Your parents are abusing you. Mental health needs to be treated just like physical health. If you had a broken leg and your parents refused to take you to a hospital, people would view that as abuse. If you're having mental health issues and they're refusing to get you medical help it's the same type of abuse, people  just can't visibly witness the abuse.\n\nCan you see a school counselor? Is there ANY adult in your life that you can trust to help you?", "HIPAA guidelines. I would make a complaint on that. Also, your parents are psychotic and controlling. This is so toxic and emotionally damaging!  Do amazingly well in school so you get the best chance at a good start on life. Then move far away lol", "Is this for real? It's outrageous - a. Using a therapist known to your parents is highly questionable; b.  Your parents punishing you for trying to fix things; c. Your therapist for sharing details.  I'm afraid you're surrounded by unhelpful or even toxic people. Be assured though that this is not your fault.", "Nobody in the history of therapy has ever NOT talked about their parents, so I'm very confused how that could have surprised or upset them. You're 14: who else would you discuss, your teachers? And the therapist obviously is at fault here for alluding to it at all. NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. So many unreasonable things here. \n1. Parents don\u2019t believe in therapy? That\u2019s so sad they should want any support possible to help you thrive. \n2. Therapists absolutely can not disclose ANY information from your sessions unless legally required to (for example, sometimes therapists have to testify in court if they counseled a couple who is divorcing and battling for custody or something like that. While likely not a worthwhile route in your situation, this therapist should be reported to their college or board as this is a very clear violation of their ethical standards. \n3. Your parents should absolutely encourage you to talk about them in therapy. The whole point of therapy is a safe space to process all of the complex aspects of our lives. Your parents shouldn\u2019t feel threatened by that. If they\u2019re embarrassed that you\u2019re sharing with a friend of theirs, well, maybe don\u2019t choose a friend as the therapist. \n4. Your family is punishing you by not speaking to you because you are trying to take care of yourself. \n\nPlease know that none of this is right or okay or your fault. There may not much you can do right now, but somewhere in your mind and heart tuck away the information that this isn\u2019t right and isn\u2019t how healthy loving relationships work. When you are in a position to make your own choices, choose to do much better for yourself and the family you get to create as an adult.", "Nta.

That\u2019s a breach of patient confidentiality and can be reported. If you\u2019re unsure how, maybe ask a school counsellor or a trusted adult like a friends parent.

NTAAAAAAA your parents and therapists are the assholes. god honestly all i do in therapy is bitch about my parents it's like the whole point", "NTA. Quite the opposite: this kind of thing is what therapy is for. It's also why therapists aren't supposed to work for their friends, or their friends' children.

The entire point of therapy is to be able to talk about your problems privately and work them out (not sure if this is entirely true but it is kind of). I'm pretty sure most therapists spend some time mentioning of how their sessions will be private and how they wont \"tell a soul\" unless your safety is at risk.

It\u2019s highly recommended you talk about your parents. I would reach out to a school counselor, you need a safe space to speak.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong.", "Wow this is really awful, I'm so sorry this happened to you. I wanted to go to a therapist as a teenager at one point, but was actually just terrified to talk to my parents about it. I was sorta nervous they'd ask me what I was talking about, and they would have been a hot topic! I was also terrified my mum would end up knowing the therapist and would weasel information out of him, she knew a lot of people in the medical world, and genuinely had crazy interrogation / detective skills. \n\nEventually as an adult when I could afford to I paid for my own therapist and it was very beneficial. I was still terrified of back-chanelling (I'm a little paranoid too) so I saw a therapist online that was definitely far removed from my parents' potential social / professional networks. \n\nFirst thing we talked about was confidentiality and it made me realise how I was probably needlessly worried all those years back, because confidentiality is basically rule #1 for therapists. The only exception is where they have strong reason to believe a very serious crime has happened or is about to happen, and in those cases they can only talk to law enforcement. It could be slightly different with a minor because parents have responsibility, but I just know that it's not OK your therapist talked to your parents, there is absolutely no excuse and I'd be really skeptical if they're a real therapist or just someone your parents knew who could talk to you that they could get info out of.\n\nAs many others said, I'd suggest trying to talk to a school counselor about this issue. I don't know what services are available where you live, but school therapist is probably the best place to get that info, and also someone who can look into that shady therapist. I get you probably have difficulty trusting strange adults as a result of this, but honestly most counselors and therapists are not like your one, or your parents. You don't even need to talk to them about the breach of confidentiality or problems with your old therapist or parents, but you might be able to get access to another *real* therapist. \n\nYou're 100% NTA and your parents are absolutely awful for punishing you for talking about them in therapy, and for preventing you seeing a therapist now. And your therapist... Just makes me mad.", " NTA and that\u2019s a total hippa violation/conflict of interest.  If you choose to take it further they could lose their license.  I had a therapist do that and we got her fired.  Total breach of trust", "NTA. Your therapist was operating unethically. Please report them. Also, your parents are toxic and abusive. Do you have a trusted adult, maybe via school, that you can talk to around what\u2019s going on?", "NTA: Stop seeing this therapist. If you\u2019re in school see if your counselors offer counseling sessions or other resources that may be free to help you.\n\nI know you\u2019re really young but you should try to look up your state licensing board or report a hippa violation on this therapist.

You are absolutely allowed to talk about your parents in therapy.", "Your therapist has broken the ethical rules of their license, I believe, and if you were to report this they would lose their job forever. I'm just about coming down on the side of doing this anyway to make sure they can't do the same to someone much more vulnerable than you seem to be. This sort of thing could result in an (attempted) suicide for the truly vulnerable. As a minimum you should mention this to your parents to make them back off from threatening their friend' s career and let you get back to the therapy you need.", "Your NTA.  But there\u2019s a clear conflict of interest here.  Your therapist shouldn\u2019t be a friend of your parents.  She\u2019s committed at least a couple of ethics violations here.
