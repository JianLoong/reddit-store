I know you might not feel like trusting adults right now, but consider going to a counselor at school for help to advocate for you.\n\nLastly, I cannot overstate the size of the red flag your parents were flying when they told you not to talk about them in therapy. Why? Were they concerned you would reveal mistreatment? Sure sounds like it.", "NTA- Your therapist should have never agreed to work with you due to a conflict of interest (Being friends with your parent). That's against the ethical codes that therapists are held to uphold. Depending on what the therapist shared with your parents, that's also a breach of your confidentiality (even as a minor). Is there any way that you could reach out to a teacher at your school or a school counselor (preferably) who can advocate on your behalf?  \n\n\nIt's a rough world already, and it's even tougher when your immediate family isn't helpful.

Mental health needs to be treated just like physical health. If you had a broken leg and your parents refused to take you to a hospital, people would view that as abuse. If you're having mental health issues and they're refusing to get you medical help it's the same type of abuse, people  just can't visibly witness the abuse.\n\nCan you see a school counselor? Is there ANY adult in your life that you can trust to help you?", "HIPAA guidelines. I would make a complaint on that. Also, your parents are psychotic and controlling.

Be assured though that this is not your fault.", "Nobody in the history of therapy has ever NOT talked about their parents, so I'm very confused how that could have surprised or upset them.

So many unreasonable things here. \n1. Parents don\u2019t believe in therapy? That\u2019s so sad they should want any support possible to help you thrive. \n2. Therapists absolutely can not disclose ANY information from your sessions unless legally required to (for example, sometimes therapists have to testify in court if they counseled a couple who is divorcing and battling for custody or something like that. While likely not a worthwhile route in your situation, this therapist should be reported to their college or board as this is a very clear violation of their ethical standards. \n3. Your parents should absolutely encourage you to talk about them in therapy. The whole point of therapy is a safe space to process all of the complex aspects of our lives. Your parents shouldn\u2019t feel threatened by that. If they\u2019re embarrassed that you\u2019re sharing with a friend of theirs, well, maybe don\u2019t choose a friend as the therapist. \n4. Your family is punishing you by not speaking to you because you are trying to take care of yourself. \n\nPlease know that none of this is right or okay or your fault. There may not much you can do right now, but somewhere in your mind and heart tuck away the information that this isn\u2019t right and isn\u2019t how healthy loving relationships work.

You did nothing wrong.", "Wow this is really awful, I'm so sorry this happened to you. I wanted to go to a therapist as a teenager at one point, but was actually just terrified to talk to my parents about it. I was sorta nervous they'd ask me what I was talking about, and they would have been a hot topic! I was also terrified my mum would end up knowing the therapist and would weasel information out of him, she knew a lot of people in the medical world, and genuinely had crazy interrogation / detective skills. \n\nEventually as an adult when I could afford to I paid for my own therapist and it was very beneficial. I was still terrified of back-chanelling (I'm a little paranoid too) so I saw a therapist online that was definitely far removed from my parents' potential social / professional networks. \n\nFirst thing we talked about was confidentiality and it made me realise how I was probably needlessly worried all those years back, because confidentiality is basically rule #1 for therapists. The only exception is where they have strong reason to believe a very serious crime has happened or is about to happen, and in those cases they can only talk to law enforcement. It could be slightly different with a minor because parents have responsibility, but I just know that it's not OK your therapist talked to your parents, there is absolutely no excuse and I'd be really skeptical if they're a real therapist or just someone your parents knew who could talk to you that they could get info out of.\n\nAs many others said, I'd suggest trying to talk to a school counselor about this issue. I don't know what services are available where you live, but school therapist is probably the best place to get that info, and also someone who can look into that shady therapist. I get you probably have difficulty trusting strange adults as a result of this, but honestly most counselors and therapists are not like your one, or your parents. You don't even need to talk to them about the breach of confidentiality or problems with your old therapist or parents, but you might be able to get access to another *real* therapist. \n\nYou're 100% NTA and your parents are absolutely awful for punishing you for talking about them in therapy, and for preventing you seeing a therapist now. And your therapist... Just makes me mad.", " NTA and that\u2019s a total hippa violation/conflict of interest.  If you choose to take it further they could lose their license.

Please take care of yourself.  The fact that they reacted so terribly and immediately stole away your means to contact other people in response is horrifying.  This isn't okay.  Is there anyone at all in your school that you can trust to talk to about this?  Any extended family member who isn't like your parents?  \n\nYou aren't wrong.
