Getting two lawyers and a judge to agree on what is or isn't reasonable is always a fun challenge. \n\nLegally you should probably just pass this up the chain, or drop it.", "It\u2019s no one\u2019s business to know her disability. You guessing honestly makes you more of an AH. You\u2019re coming to these conclusions based on biased assumptions about an employee you clearly take personal issue with.", "So why is it a problem?", "We are a zero tolerance employer and happiness is ground for immediate termination.\n\nHad a boss like that before if he saw you smile you better get ready for a lecture about how your not doing your job.", "She pretty clearly told OP she'd like to keep them as accommodation for a disability. That should at least open the conversation about what a reasonable accommodation would look like even if it's not this. But OP says in a comment that no accommodation would be acceptable to him and that he thinks it shouldnt be needed. That puts OP firmly in the wrong, even if the employee didn't go about asking for accommodation through the proper channels.", "The parents and teachers care about professionalism.", "the only way i can see the stuffed animals being a problem (i used to work with disabled young adults) is that if they want the toy, they might have an issue with \u201cit\u2019s not yours\u201d, \u201cno you have to sit down you can\u2019t get up to get it\u201d while the bus is in motion. \n\nwith that being said, if it hasn\u2019t caused a problem yet and i\u2019m guessing she picks up the same kids everyday, let her have the damn toys. ask her to keep them in a bag that gets taken with her every day on and off the bus but unless it\u2019s EXPLICITLY in her job contract that no other items be brought into the bus, then YTA. and even if it is in the contract that she cannot have the toys, YTA for the way you spoke to her.", "INFO are you a doctor, or just an asshole? YTA", "Doesn't matter what you suspect. Are accommodations made for her by the employer due to the disability she claims?", "She can get benefit payments from the government. (Not in the USA)", "She's clearly not in the right mindset to work.", "And are you familiar with Canadian law on this subject?", "Ok so get it in writing from her doctor what her disabilities are. Try to work with her on the accommodation issue as much as possible.", "OP, definitely check with HR about how to proceed. If she does require the animals, they can document it, so no further issues happen again.", "Because I know one day a parent will complain. Or a kid will try and take one of the toys.", "If her job is working with disabled children, it sure seems like a valid professional choice to add fun and whimsy to their lives by having cute stuffed animals in the van that they drive around in. There is absolutely nothing unprofessional about this.", ">Who do you think she should be catering to? She is driving disabled kids, not shuttling around world leaders - who does she need to appear more professional to and why?\n\nThe parents and teachers care about the children's safety and their needs being adequately met in a safe, suitable environment. Having toys just makes that environment more welcoming.", "You are sorely mistaken!!!   I have special needs children who ride on the school bus every single day.

Really sounds like you have a problem cause you're a petty, small, insignificant person who feels the need to exercise control over someone cause you can't control or meaningfully impact the world around you.", "She's literally driving children around, the stuffed animals could easily be there to amuse the kids. Having children's things in an area where children are is hardly unprofessional lol.", "The parents and teachers do not care about this.

People with disabilities have the right to work...you sound like a bully.", "Your comments are making it sound more and more like you are an ableist and your objection to the stuffed toys has more to do with your ableism than the toys actually being a problem.", "you\u2019ve got problems", "I hope you get fired for discussing personal matters of your employees on social media. BTW she sounds like she is on the spectrum. I think it is amazing she is working. Too bad her boss has no life.", "You said she\u2019s perfect on paper and it sounds like there haven\u2019t been any complaints about her.

It might even help a child who is anxious calm down to have  special bus animals", "I\u2019m a parent and I would never complain about this. I bet the kids love this particular driver.
