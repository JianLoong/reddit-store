Being empathetic rather than defensive can avoid a fight in a situation like this one. \n\nIt's true it wasn't your responsibility, but do unto others applies.

Also it will heat up the fridge if it is more than a normal dinner, making it better to keep on the counter for 30 minutes to an hour before refrigerating. \n\nThe bacteria thing is just if it\u2019s not cooled quickly enough (bacteria thrives in 20-65 degrees celcius). The longer the food stays in this zone, the more time bacteria have to multiply. \n\nThis is also something to think about when storing densely packed containers with hot food - it will take forever to cool in the centre, making it a hotspot for bacteria.", "Agreed, people are going nuts over, what,6 or 8 hours?

But that also saves me a lot of food waste, since the food will last longer in the fridge if properly taken care of from the get go. \n\nAnyway, food sitting on the counter for hours on end is not a good choice when having the option to refrigerate it - even if it\u2019s been fine every other time. Bacteria will still multiply in cool conditions, and if there\u2019s already a lot after many hours in room temperature, it will go bad fast in the fridge. \n\nLess food waste and less chance of food poisoning?

You can explain yourself even further, with valid reasonable points made and ppl just won't get it.", "It is only food waste if you have to throw it out. Making stuff last longer if you aren't going to eat it otherwise is good, but throwing out edible food (even if it has been on the counter for hours for example, no weird smells or anything) because it doesn't meet industry standards is still food waste.", "I'm sure you're right. Probably time to stop trying. Points made.", "The weird smells comes from toxins the bacteria produce. Both the toxins and strains of bacteria can be harmful. Perfect example here is cooked rice and pasta stored in room temperature, that literally have killed people. \n\nThat is an extreme, but knowledge about food safety, what causes a food poisoning and how to cook and store food properly is a good tool to have.

If she\u2019s mad at anyone, it should be herself and/or her friends who should\u2019ve helped clean up, as thanks for her hosting them.

Would you eat, say, potato salad that's been out for six hours?", "Pass the room temp sashimi please", "That is not remotely true. There is a risk with putting large amounts of very hot food into a home refrigerator because it can raise the overall temp of the fridge and cause other foods to go bad or damage the cooling system. Cooling food faster is always better - use ice in things like soup or stew, pack the food in large, shallow pans, and do not cover tightly until completely cold. \n\nThat said, an hour at room temperature will not hurt most foods. But refrigerating immediately after cooking will not cause bacterial growth."]}
