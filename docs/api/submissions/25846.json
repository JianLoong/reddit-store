I'm using a throwaway account because I don't like posting on my main.\n\nThe book I read to him is called \"Moominland Midwinter\" it is a book by finnish writer and illustrator, Tove Jansson.\nI was born and raised in Finland, I grew up with the Moomins and I really want it to be part of my son's life too.\nBut when my husband found out about it, he got really mad.\n\nHe said that \"the illustrations were too scary for kids\" and that he had done some research on Tove Jansson and found out she was queer. I asked him what was wrong with being queer and he said \"Nothing is wrong with being queer, but people should stop showing things made by queer people to kids\".\n\nI got really mad at him for saying something like that, I felt that it was very homophobic for him to say. \nSo I got mad at him and we had a big argument.\nI told him that I wanted our son to be more connected with the finnish culture and heritage, and that the Moomins are a big part of it.\n\nHe told me that he \"doesn't care\" and that he would not allow it since the finnish culture would \"turn him into a homosexual\".\nWhen he said that I exploded and kicked him out of the apartment, I told him he's not allowed to come back until I've sorted my feelings out and that he could stay with his parents in the meantime. \n\nI feel so confused and angry at him, he has never said anything like that in the 11 years we've dated and I'm starting to wonder if I married someone that has put on a fake personality of some sort. \nThis all happened yesterday and I haven't talked to him since, I told one of my friends about it and she said that I overreacted and it isn't that serious.\n\nSo now I'm here to ask, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1693379868, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1657p32/aita_for_reading_a_book_to_my_son/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These conflicts of interest are not going to diminish because you kicked him out temporarily. He has now made his feelings known and it is up to you to decide if these facts about your life partner are deal breakers for you. Clearly these are views he has kept to himself until now, and he doesn't sound open to discussion. This is who he is. The ball is in your court. I wish you luck and hope you make good decisions for both yourself and your child.", "Absolutely NTA, it's the moomins ffs.", "Given how many people in the arts have (likely) been, and are, queer, your husband would be denying your child a whole wealth of experience. Plus I loved The Moomins when I was a kid. 100% NTA. Edit, I am actually gay, but doubt very much The Moomins were responsible!", "Wow, NTA. He's acting really stupid", "Fellow Finn here. Firstly, NTA. Moomins are a huge part of Finnish literature and the themes of the book teach children to understand and emphatize with several situations and emotions like joy, happiness, love, adventures, sadness, comfort, loneliness, fear, etc... And sure, Groke and Lady of the Cold from the japanese animations prolly traumatized every 90s kid, but they were misunderstood creatures which is explained later. The characters are nonsexual beings and Tove being gay has nothing to do with anything. There's no age limit for the books. \n\nYou husband sounds like a homophobic and unsympathetic asshole. Sorry for sounding harsh, I actually got mad reading this post. Ironically, he probably would have turned into a better human being if someone had read him Moomin books when he was a child. Leave him, is my take on the whole thing.", "NTA. Protect your kid from him, if he's having a meltdown over fucking moomins he's going to be a danger to your child long term (regardless of if the kid is straight or not) he's obviously got some sick obsession with the idea of his kid being somehow \"turned gay\" and needing to \"protect\" him from that seems to view lgbtqia+ people as inherently predatory \n\nmaybe he's got trauma of his own that's been triggered by something and has decided to blame the lgbtqia+ people for that because it's easier to buy into a well established conspiracy with a million other bigots on the bandwagon than to actually address what specifically happened to you... but that's no excuse for bigotry or this ridiculous behaviour of not even allowing children's books by not straight authors \n\n idk maybe counselling separately and together if you can but I'd reccomend taking some space to step back and think about the relationship and if you feel safe with him yeah if this kind of behaviour continues really think about if you want to raise your kid in a household where he'll be brainwashed like this to hate other people or where he feels like he can't bring friends home or watch x tv show in case dad thinks they're gay and has a tantrum/rant - children pick up on homophobia it's not invisible to them they'll see the way he responds to say a queer character on TV or the snarky way he insults a queer family member & it'll stick with them for life \n\nI just read an update on reddit  where a kid who was like 13 had killed himself likely after bullying from an unsupportive father who showcased the same \"logic\" of hating gay people and wanting to control his child's sexuality and had sought the Ops husband's assistance in diy conversion \"therapy\" prior to the son's suicide which was likely partially as a result of this homophobic abuse. \n\nThis kind of attitude is dangerous towards children ecspecilly lgbtqia+ kids and if it's not addressed it can lead to all manner of abuse against a child including sexual abuse being justified by the abusing parent/s as \"straightening them out\"", "NTA. The Moomins saga is a fantastic read for children! Full of adventures, friendship, family, joy and love. There are absolutely no sexual undertones in it. Your husband has a weird hang-up. I can understand it somehow regarding the current public discourse about \"queer children literature\", but come on. He can read it himself if he isn't sure if it is suitable for your son - if he finds something inappropriate in the book itself, he is more than welcome to bring it up and embarass himself in the process. The sexuality of the author has nothing to do with the book itself.", "NTA but this doesn't sound real...", "Wow, all these years, and I didn\u2019t realise ALL of Finland was gay! My apologies Finnish people, for assuming that, like every other country in the world, you have your own identities and cannot be classified by one only /s", "He told you who he is, listen to him. \n\nNTA", "NTA, your husband seems to have hid his homophobic views to you which is not uncommon at all. I really think it's for the best that you kicked him out to sort your feelings out. \nBecause not only did he reveal his homophobic views to you, but he also disrespected your culture. I really wish you and your son well in the future!", "NTA I\u2019m American and the Moomins are phenomenal", "NTA. It's important for you to share your cultural heritage and the things you love with your son. Reading \"Moominland Midwinter\" to him is a way to do that. Your husband's reaction seems unreasonable and homophobic. You have the right to be upset about his comments, and standing up for what you believe is important for your son's upbringing is commendable. It's worth having a calm and open conversation with your husband about your feelings and the importance of acceptance.", "What the fuck? This is way bigger than a book. Your husband is a homophobic asshole. Has something happened recently which might have triggered this? \n\nJust looked up Moonin characters. They look delightful. You are never an AH for sharing your culture like this. NTA\n\nEdit to add - I hope he isn\u2019t into Harry Porter, be sure Dumbledore is supposedly gay.", " Nta fr", "NTA you get an award for kicking out the AH. I am so sorry you got involved w someone so ignorant, & dangerously ignorant. He'd hate the Brothers Grimm or probably pretty much most books kids love.", "Nta honestly since I was tot I was forced to watch a lot of horror movies. Some I was scared others not so much (the exorcist never got me but the one scene in 6th sense did. Watched alien but freaking Signs scared me.) however what did scare me a lot was gore and I never did well with Final destination most times. Was never scared of It but yeah i think Moomins it totally okay lol I\u2019ve seen a lot of disturbing stuff as a kid such Devil Man lol\n\noverall it\u2019s never made me wanna summon demons, be a clown, or the such so I doubt it\u2019s gonna make your kid gay. I believe sharing cultures is such a fascinating and opening one\u2019s mind for it.", "NTA- I'm really sorry you just found out your husband's a homophobe. That's horrifying.", "NTA\nBut Moomins freak me tf out. Especially that little girl \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA.  \"Comet in Moominland\" is the first book I can remember reading on my own - that was in England in the 1950s not long after it was published.  Maybe the first book I read that was set in a really different world from my own.  It was a bit scary but ultimately inspiring.\n\nGetting me a Finnish story book was consistent with my parents' preference for Scandinavian furniture.  Your hubby probably thinks beechwood armchairs turn you gay.", "NTA I'm not Finnish but I LOVED the Moomin books! And I had no idea the author was queer until right now. I came out nearly two decades ago. So there goes that theory \ud83d\ude0f", "Sorry to hear that your husband is a bigot.\n\nThe Moomins are great. And they've been around forever - I remember reading the books as a child in the 1970s in the UK and they made it into quite a popular tv series as well iirc though I think I had perhaps aged out of the series by then.\n\nThe idea that your husband is saying stuff like \"he would not allow it\" and it could \"turn your son into a homosexual\" is quite worrying though, and the fact that he thinks that reading The Moomins could turn your son into a homosexual makes me think that he is seriously lacking in intelligence.  NTA", "Fuck your husband, or, rather, don't do that. If you were reading your 7 year old IT or something, maybe, but your xenophobic husband is the anus here. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He wants to deny you sharing your heritage, which is by extension your son's heritage, with your child because it'll \"turn him gay\"? That argument has so many things wrong with it I don't even know where to start. People don't get \"turned\" gay, and there's nothing wrong with being gay anyways. What would your husband do if your child did turn out to be gay? It doesn't sound like he'd be supportive.", "NTA. Your husband is a huge homophobe and xenophobe overall. There is no knowing how much deeper his hate goes and what he will do in the future", "NTA. Anyone who insults Moomins should be banished from society.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My best friends mom was Finnish & had Moomins plates and artwork all over the house", "NTA. I don't think you overreacted. This is very weird behaviour. The only thing I can think is that your husband is finding fatherhood and family life more stressful than he expected and is having some kind of breakdown.
