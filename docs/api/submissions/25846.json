I asked him what was wrong with being queer and he said \"Nothing is wrong with being queer, but people should stop showing things made by queer people to kids\".\n\nI got really mad at him for saying something like that, I felt that it was very homophobic for him to say. \nSo I got mad at him and we had a big argument.\nI told him that I wanted our son to be more connected with the finnish culture and heritage, and that the Moomins are a big part of it.\n\nHe told me that he \"doesn't care\" and that he would not allow it since the finnish culture would \"turn him into a homosexual\".\nWhen he said that I exploded and kicked him out of the apartment, I told him he's not allowed to come back until I've sorted my feelings out and that he could stay with his parents in the meantime. \n\nI feel so confused and angry at him, he has never said anything like that in the 11 years we've dated and I'm starting to wonder if I married someone that has put on a fake personality of some sort. \nThis all happened yesterday and I haven't talked to him since, I told one of my friends about it and she said that I overreacted and it isn't that serious.\n\nSo now I'm here to ask, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1693379868, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1657p32/aita_for_reading_a_book_to_my_son/", "score": 180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wish you luck and hope you make good decisions for both yourself and your child.", "Absolutely NTA, it's the moomins ffs.", "Given how many people in the arts have (likely) been, and are, queer, your husband would be denying your child a whole wealth of experience. Plus I loved The Moomins when I was a kid. 100% NTA. Edit, I am actually gay, but doubt very much The Moomins were responsible!", "Wow, NTA. He's acting really stupid", "Fellow Finn here. Firstly, NTA. Moomins are a huge part of Finnish literature and the themes of the book teach children to understand and emphatize with several situations and emotions like joy, happiness, love, adventures, sadness, comfort, loneliness, fear, etc... And sure, Groke and Lady of the Cold from the japanese animations prolly traumatized every 90s kid, but they were misunderstood creatures which is explained later. The characters are nonsexual beings and Tove being gay has nothing to do with anything. There's no age limit for the books. \n\nYou husband sounds like a homophobic and unsympathetic asshole. Sorry for sounding harsh, I actually got mad reading this post. Ironically, he probably would have turned into a better human being if someone had read him Moomin books when he was a child. Leave him, is my take on the whole thing.", "NTA. Protect your kid from him, if he's having a meltdown over fucking moomins he's going to be a danger to your child long term (regardless of if the kid is straight or not) he's obviously got some sick obsession with the idea of his kid being somehow \"turned gay\" and needing to \"protect\" him from that seems to view lgbtqia+ people as inherently predatory \n\nmaybe he's got trauma of his own that's been triggered by something and has decided to blame the lgbtqia+ people for that because it's easier to buy into a well established conspiracy with a million other bigots on the bandwagon than to actually address what specifically happened to you... but that's no excuse for bigotry or this ridiculous behaviour of not even allowing children's books by not straight authors \n\n idk maybe counselling separately and together if you can but I'd reccomend taking some space to step back and think about the relationship and if you feel safe with him yeah if this kind of behaviour continues really think about if you want to raise your kid in a household where he'll be brainwashed like this to hate other people or where he feels like he can't bring friends home or watch x tv show in case dad thinks they're gay and has a tantrum/rant - children pick up on homophobia it's not invisible to them they'll see the way he responds to say a queer character on TV or the snarky way he insults a queer family member & it'll stick with them for life \n\nI just read an update on reddit  where a kid who was like 13 had killed himself likely after bullying from an unsupportive father who showcased the same \"logic\" of hating gay people and wanting to control his child's sexuality and had sought the Ops husband's assistance in diy conversion \"therapy\" prior to the son's suicide which was likely partially as a result of this homophobic abuse. \n\nThis kind of attitude is dangerous towards children ecspecilly lgbtqia+ kids and if it's not addressed it can lead to all manner of abuse against a child including sexual abuse being justified by the abusing parent/s as \"straightening them out\"", "NTA. The Moomins saga is a fantastic read for children! Full of adventures, friendship, family, joy and love. There are absolutely no sexual undertones in it. Your husband has a weird hang-up. I can understand it somehow regarding the current public discourse about \"queer children literature\", but come on. He can read it himself if he isn't sure if it is suitable for your son - if he finds something inappropriate in the book itself, he is more than welcome to bring it up and embarass himself in the process.

It's important for you to share your cultural heritage and the things you love with your son. Reading \"Moominland Midwinter\" to him is a way to do that.

Maybe the first book I read that was set in a really different world from my own.  It was a bit scary but ultimately inspiring.\n\nGetting me a Finnish story book was consistent with my parents' preference for Scandinavian furniture.

However, if he won't go to the doctor or if there is no illness that would cause bizarre behavior then you'll have to decide if you want to try couples counseling or go straight to a divorce attorney.", "NTA and I think the people here might get a kick out of this YouTube series.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@ruiningmoomin](https://www.youtube.com/@ruiningmoomin)", "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being queer but my child being queer and them wanting to be treated like normal people is where I draw the line\u201d\n\nNTA\nI don\u2019t know how you manage to go 11 years and a whole child without such vitriol ever coming up in conversation.", "NTA - People don't get 'turned homosexual' They either are, or they are not. I grew up watching the moomins - and I've (M53) been happily married for 31 years (to a women!) LOL", "NTA. He\u2019s homophobic.", "NTA.  Your husband is a bigot.", "NTA, sounds like he might have been influenced by some right winger? That rhetoric is pretty common now. Apparently is soooo easy to change someone\u2019s sexuality\u2026\nDie on this hill, he\u2019s the biggest A and Moonins are lovely stories. (I grew up with them/ Swede)", "NTA. \n\nHis reaction is extreme and should not be tolerated. He hasn\u2019t even read the book. I had exactly this book, is it about them getting ready to hibernate in winter and waking up in summer? Such a nice book for children! And the Moomins are so cute! If he thinks those are scary, he should see some of the artwork in old children books.", "NTA this is very serious OP because it has implications to your child\n\nThe biggest thing homophobes can\u2019t wrap tbeir head around is that we didn\u2019t choose same sex attraction. Idk if we are born with it or during puberty something is different but all I know is I did not get a choice. So reading a book simply written by a queer person does not make people gay \ud83d\ude2d it isn\u2019t a microbial disease it isn\u2019t contagious. Though if your child were to end up being gay later down the line will your husband support or disown your child. Thats the question you have to ask now because if your kid is there is no changing it and your husband seems lkke he would disown your child.\n\nEdit: It is actually insane to me that people will go \u201cit has no gay content in it, but was written by a gay, so that means itll make my child gay\u201d LIKE WHAT come back to reality please", "She also found out that the guy is UNBELIEVABLY stupid. In Poland some Moomin short stories are on the required reading list for first graders. And it's not a very queer-friendly country. Not the worst, but for the EU standards... not good either.", "Mhm, that's true, but fairly certain in fantastic beasts there's like some form of indication but idk.", "I mean, the moomins are *scary*. My sister was terrified of the Groke, and I of the Ice Queen, and especially the comet. But we both *love* moomins, and kids like being a little bit scared. Perhaps it's because I'm Swedish, but Moomins is a big part of our culture.", "Don\u2019t you know Finland doesn\u2019t exist? \n\n(It\u2019s my favorite bizarre conspiracy theory.)", "> Edit to add - I hope he isn\u2019t into Harry Porter, be sure Dumbledore is supposedly gay.\n\nAnd JKR is transphobic, so it's not really a win for representation.", "It\u2019s not that much of a stretch for him to google the author\u2019s name from the front of the book or the book and author and see that in the results, she\u2019s very well known. \u201cTove Jansson wife\u201d is the very first suggested search when I typed just her name in. \n\nHis homophobia not coming up sooner is stranger, but some people \u201cknow better\u201d than to be homophobic in public while reacting like this when paranoid about the prospect of their own child being gay, no matter how stupid their reasoning.", "We have them in the UK but it's not particularly huge.\nThe idea that they turn your kids gay is so comically stupid I don't know what to say.", "What? Tove Jansson lived openly for decades with her female partner. It wasn't a secret.", "Yes!!", "Maybe he saw some Tom of Finland pictures and took the moniker way too seriously", "True. Need more context.", "they are GROSS and i hate them.", "Really? Live and learn", "Mhm, that's true, but fairly certain in fantastic beasts there's like some form of indication but idk", "If we are talking stereotypes, he always wore flamboyant robes, at least in the books.\n\nThe author does love her stereotypes.", "I mean the Fantastic Beast movies made it canon 15 years after JKR just threw it out there that \"she always thought of him as gay\" after the publication of book 7...so it still kinda feels more like something that was just thrown out there and then had the Grindelwald story from the last book built up into something that fit that narrative since there was no other support for it anywhere in thousands of pages across 7 books.", "Okay yeah point taken"]}
