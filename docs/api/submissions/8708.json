I was like oh shit yeah I forgot, I'll get started on that right now. My aunt freaked out and said that I promised I would make dinner and that she asked me to have it done by 6 and to just forget about cooking, she'll order something for herself. She then locked herself in her room. \n\nI ended up just making the burgers (I made 4 with the amount of meat I had) like I was planning on doing and around 7:00 told my uncle that dinner was ready. He went to go get my aunt but she refused to come out of her room. I wasn't really hungry so I just went in my room to relax. Later on my uncle said that she was refusing to eat the burgers (out of spite I guess) and that he was just gonna grab something else for the both of them. I was a little annoyed but if she doesn't want to eat what I made that's her decision. \n\nSo later that night after not having eaten all day I was starving and I ended up eating all 4 burgers. The next day my aunt is rummaging around in the fridge and she asks me where the food I made last night was. I told her I ate it and she called me greedy and said I could have at least saved her one. So I was like maybe you should have just had one last night and she stormed off and hasn't talked to me since. My uncle says she's really upset with me.

Not the end of the world, but you do need to be accountable, you messed up there. Your aunt, however, acted like a child in response.", "NTA. I am unsure why she is making a big deal of this. Just order/cook more food?!", "NTA. Is your aunt always this childish? It sounds like your uncle is used to her tantrums.", "she sounds like a b\\*t#!\n\nNTA", "ESH. You failed to meet your commitment, your aunt reacted poorly, and then you binge ate the entire meal? Literally no one needs FOUR burgers, especially with sides. Have a calm, rational conversation about this with your aunt and uncle, and then do better in the future.", "INFO: are you making side dishes? What's getting served at 7pm with these burgers? Is this like, they make you a big properly balanced meal at 6 and you are grilling four burgers and throwing a bag of buns on the counter and calling that dinner? Do you clean up after dinner? Do you make a giant mess while prepping food? Do you guys take turns doing dishes?\n\nI have a feeling that you might be a bad cook, messy cook, lazy cook, or all of the above in addition to not serving food at the agreed upon time. I think she's pissed about other things too, and her overreaction is a clue...", "NTA.", "Your aunt sounds immature, NTA", "NTA - I hope you get a new place to live soon. She sounds immature and toxic.", "NTA Agreement or no, if dinner is made for you and you refuse out of spite or any reason, then your refusal is made and you can't complain if the meal is gone later.", "NTA, mate, happens to the best of us. Your aunt's extreme reaction was kinda sorta weird though, not sure if that's a common thing for her to do, act like a two-year-old. Set your clock next time.", "NTA. I would encourage you to ask your aunt why the 6pm thing is so important, because maybe she has a reason for it.", "My 65 year old mother locked herself in the bathroom because she didn't like the movie we chose. But she didn't say anything about it so no one noticed until she came back in an hour later and dramatically announced that \"this movie is disgusting so if anyone needs me before it's over, I'll be in the bathroom!\" and then relocked herself in the bathroom. \n\n(The movie was The Dark Knight).", "In her defense, her blood sugar might have been low and she really needed to eat. That happens to me occasionally and it can literally bring me to tears, involuntarily. I can see going into my room rather than crying in front of other people. But getting mad and yelling the next day is total AH move. OP is NTA.", "When I cook I buy my own groceries", "Yep. Unless OP regularly forgets to cook, then an hour wait for dinner is no huge deal. There are, I am sure, other things in the household to snack on to tide the niece over. I'm assuming OP made a mistake when they put \"aunt\" because surely no one over the age of five would pull the \"lock myself in my room\" and \"silent treatment\" stuff.", "I buy the food that I cook. Most of the time I eat at work so it's not like they have to buy any extra food for me", "It has happened occasionally, but it usually just means we end up eating a little later", "You did not Make an honest mistake you had a responsibility and you didn't want to do it. You are 18 now and you're lucky to be living with them. Just set your clock Do what you agreed to and peace will return.", "We are lacking info.  Maybe the aunt just snapped after op couldn't do the one thing they ask of them for the nth time.", "In my defense I work nights so typically I don't eat anything all day and then have a large meal after I close.", "I just ate the patties lol", "The sides were tater tots and a salad. I did all the dishes immediately after I finished cooking. If I were such a bad cook why does she keep asking me to make dinner?", "And I don't typically eat dinner with them, I get food from work", "You feel? You feel op\u2019s a bad cook based on this post?", "Thank you for the laugh. The dramatics of it all. Sounds like some of my older friends.", "She is also fully capable of getting herself a snack \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Yeah,  NTA", "This makes you NTA. People forget, no big deal, as soon as you were reminded you started on it. And you paid for the food so you had every right to eat all of it if you wanted to.", "But she specifically said that she wanted dinner cooked by 6pm that day. I don't think you're the asshole but it is part of your agreement that you cook dinner - you should therefore cook it within a reasonable timeframe or not need reminding to do it.", "So you\u2019ve never forgotten anything you said you\u2019d do? Ever?", "A one-time mistake when OP's own blood sugar is low due to not eating is absolutely understandable. And she'd started, obviously, by putting it out to thaw in the first place. Barring OP forgetting to cook every week or two, this is not a big deal. This is a\"shit, better get some chips n salsa to eat until dinner is ready\" deal.", "Nope. You should plan your food intake better, but at no point does anyone need to eat four burgers in one go. Binge eating is not good for you, either.", "Hmmmm k. Well that checks out. I am going with NTA on dinner. Late better than not at all and its a balanced meal. \nHow old is she? Menopause?", "If it was really bad food or a destroyed kitchen it might explain why the overreaction or why the uncle did not eat either.  I admit I saw 18 year old male and was prejudiced. That's why I asked for more info.", "Yes, she is. I'm just trying to put myself in her shoes. I get low blood sugar and it makes me emotional even when I don't intend to be.", "Also- OP is a human and simply FORGOT. And instantly apologized and got to work on the dinner. Your expectations of OP makes me wonder how you treat people in your life if they aren\u2019t perfect", "If person want's to eat a big meal they cooked themselves does not matter if it's healthy or not if I work all day and have one meal at the end you can be sure it will be big and  I would certainly binge acting like eating four hamburgers in a single day at the same time is not something people do is laughable", "Her being a controlling nut could also explain her behavior", ">I admit I saw 18 year old male and was prejudiced.\n\nWell, at least you admitted it...", "Don\u2019t try to put yourself FULLY in someone\u2019s shoes when you have such limited information. Especially if that person is being TA in the situation", "Wow - I think you might be overreacting a bit yourself? OP said he forget and has a few times. I didn't call him the asshole and said his aunt overreacted, but he came here for judgement and I think him needing to be reminded might be an indication of why his aunt overreacted.", "Totally, but usually it's more than one thing like this if someone is a controlling nut; it would be lots of signs.", "It's called empathy. Sometimes people act like the AH but there's something else going on. And I'm not fully in her shoes as I acknowledge her total AH behavior the next day.", "The massive immature overreaction itself from the aunt instantly negates any wrongdoing from the OP. Any attempt by anyone to justify or even mildly defend the aunt is rendered moot.", "A sign like telling someone you don\u2019t want the food then getting upset when they don\u2019t save the food for you?", "No one is required to be empathetic to someone who\u2019s being entitled and childish.", "Yep, it's clear you think that from your comments. Fair enough - that's your judgement.", "Fair enough indeed, glad we could agree that you were wrong. Have a great life, hopefully I\u2019ll see you in this sub again defending jerk-offs.", "Um..... If it's happened multiple times, that does kind of suck. It still doesn't make OP an asshole, but maybe aunt was trying a new tactic to get food done and was really disappointed. There was absolutely nothing wrong with stranded saying what they said. Constructive criticism is ALWAYS important and should be welcomed. \n\nNTA, OP. I do hope you're able to restore harmony. Sorry you had to shoulder your aunt's crazy."]}
