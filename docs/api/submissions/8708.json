Ever?", "A one-time mistake when OP's own blood sugar is low due to not eating is absolutely understandable. And she'd started, obviously, by putting it out to thaw in the first place.

Sometimes people act like the AH but there's something else going on. And I'm not fully in her shoes as I acknowledge her total AH behavior the next day.", "The massive immature overreaction itself from the aunt instantly negates any wrongdoing from the OP. Any attempt by anyone to justify or even mildly defend the aunt is rendered moot.", "A sign like telling someone you don\u2019t want the food then getting upset when they don\u2019t save the food for you?", "No one is required to be empathetic to someone who\u2019s being entitled and childish.", "Yep, it's clear you think that from your comments.

If it's happened multiple times, that does kind of suck. It still doesn't make OP an asshole, but maybe aunt was trying a new tactic to get food done and was really disappointed.

Sorry you had to shoulder your aunt's crazy.", "Fuck I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s and even I still forget to cook sometimes. I help care for my mum and we alternate cooking days and there has definitely been more than one day where I\u2019ve forgotten that it\u2019s my turn to cook or simply not realised the time.\n\nYour aunt is being dramatic and acting like a child. She could easily have reminded you that it was your turn but instead she chose to throw a tantrum.

You could have easily left two for them, especially since they were from the dinner you were supposed to make for everyone.  Put a reminder on your calendar to cook on your nights.  She overreacted, but then they are doing you a favor having you live there and they deserve common courtesy.  You are an adult, so start acting like one snd follow through on your responsibilities.", "ES - when I was 10 I started cooking dinner a few days a week and as a family we were on a schedule. It is inconseivable to me that anybody who was supposed to cook dinner would 'forget' , knowing that dinner for X number of people is to be at 6 pm\n\nThat you would 'forget' isn't likely.  Perhaps you figured somebody else would cook when they found no meal ready.  You probably were not hungry and so played with your gamestation or whatever.  So by 7 pm YOU were hungry and you decided to cook the burgers.  Where they just meat or did you make actual burgers (using ingredients beyond meat)?  I suspect just meat and bread, which suited you.  I doubt anybody else could have or would have eaten them\n\nThat you ate them later one was probably just to cover up the shoddy job you'd made.  You can do quite a bit with ground beef - spagatti, meatloaf, shepards pie including veg and flavour.\n\nIf your aunt did go into her room its probably because she was so disappointed to have opened her home to somebody who didn't care enough to get the meal on the table in time.  there was an agreement and she was insulted, offended to be made a monkey off.  Some people get low blood sugare when very hungry.", "NTA Everyone sounds pretty immature in this situation. If you all can't do better than this, you need to move out. At 18, if you forgot, it was a choice. Everyone knows how to set reminders on that phone that is always nearby. If you want to stay, I suggest doing something a little special on your next cook day as an apology. Go a little above and beyond, maybe they will see how silly they acted.", "My MiL does this when called out on her crap. We all ignore it \ud83d\ude06 Now she dramatically leaves the house for hours without telling anyone where she\u2019s going and we\u2026 hold on\u2026 yup. Still ignore it!", "Many years ago I had a very stressful day with toddler, husband, and border collie all being total PITA. I announced, \"I am feeling very angry. I am putting myself in time out for my bad behavior. I am 41 years old, therefore my timeout will last 41 minutes. I am setting a timer.\"\n\nI put myself in timeout for a blissfull 41 minutes.

Teen forgets to cook? Remind them to cook. Teen eats the food you said you didn\u2019t want? Okay. You didn\u2019t want it. Teen didn\u2019t save you any? Make your own. It\u2019s that simple, OP\u2019s aunt sounds miserable.", "I left it under running cold water", "agreed", "It was in the sink under cold running water", "Someone else said this, I just ate the patties on their own.", "Wow, you're making an awful lot of assumptions here. First of all, my work schedule changes every week so the days I'm supposed to cook are not consistent. I had already taken out the ground beef to thaw, it had just slipped my mind until later that I was going to make burgers. \n\nSecond of all, I don't have a \"gamestation\", as that is not a real console and I think you know it. What I was actually doing is packing clothes for my upcoming hospital stay, I am getting surgery tomorrow and trying to schedule school and work around that has been taking up a lot of my time.\n\nThird, I would never serve plain unseasoned beef to my aunt and uncle. I add egg, bread crumbs, milk, Worcestershire, seasonings, etc to my meat when I make burgers. As well as all your standard condiments, I also made tater tots and a side salad. Nothing impressive, I know, but there was more effort put in than you give me credit for.\n\nFinally, if she was really that hungry there was nothing stopping her from getting a snack. When I lived with my dad we sometimes wouldn't have dinner until 8 or 9, I think 7 is perfectly reasonable. I admit it was my mistake not having it done by 6 but it's not like she would be dying of hunger waiting an extra hour.", "Did... did you strain yourself jumping that far?", "> so no one noticed until she came back in an hour later\n\nShe was *FUMING* in that bathroom for that hour wondering why no one was coming to find mom.", "ahahh so the set dinner time didn't matter to you?  the meal time was 6 but you preferred 7 and never mentioned that to anybody else. When she got upset you disregarded how she felt because it basically didn't matter to you and still doesn't.\n\n'if she was really hungry she could have snaked'? that's what the meal was for!!!!!!  Her body clock was set up for dinner at 6 pm.  If you want a grazing kind of meal - then next time prepare a buffet early and allow everybody to eat at a time that suits them.  Don't expect to build a relationship with your aunt and uncle over meal times\n\nYou like a casual arrangement,.  Don't be surprised if they are equally casual in their committment to you and your housing needs.  perhaps next year there will be another relative who could use a room in a house who won't disregard the householders", "I literally got upset about my husband eating the whole entire pizza last night, just cuz I was not hungry when he made it. Sure enough I went to eat a piece later and it's all gone. I totally gasped and had a mini tantrum, he said next time I should announce my intention to \"save\" it. Touche, I guess, but wtf. It's the nuance of it. Most people don't devour entire pizzas, or 4 burgers, but now me and his Aunt know and I'm going to start claiming my half of supper loudly, I guess, cuz it's not common sense? Control freaks don't just get mad about no leftovers. They get mad about LOTS of weird shit. This isn't that weird. It's a common situation when you are around stoners, binge eaters, and the like.", "But did you specifically tell your husband you didn\u2019t want any of the food or did you just say you weren\u2019t hungry at that time? Because the aunt said she didn\u2019t want it simply because it was late. Not because she wasn\u2019t hungry and would likely eat it later. But nice try.", "I said I wasn't hungry enough yet. And ya like... I would never lock myself in my room or whatever, I was laughing while I was gasping, not actually mad, just disturbed, lol. I made myself some wicked food and was fine.\nSo ya something is up with her. If not pregnant, menopausal. Its not the supper. It's something else."]}
