Perhaps you figured somebody else would cook when they found no meal ready.  You probably were not hungry and so played with your gamestation or whatever.

I suspect just meat and bread, which suited you.  I doubt anybody else could have or would have eaten them\n\nThat you ate them later one was probably just to cover up the shoddy job you'd made.  You can do quite a bit with ground beef - spagatti, meatloaf, shepards pie including veg and flavour.\n\nIf your aunt did go into her room its probably because she was so disappointed to have opened her home to somebody who didn't care enough to get the meal on the table in time.  there was an agreement and she was insulted, offended to be made a monkey off.

It's the nuance of it. Most people don't devour entire pizzas, or 4 burgers, but now me and his Aunt know and I'm going to start claiming my half of supper loudly, I guess, cuz it's not common sense?
