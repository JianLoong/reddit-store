He loves his grandchildren far more than me. I am currently his guardian he suffers from serve cognitive decline. Before his decline getting worse he informed me he wished to pay for their tuition. So I made sure to do that. So my father paid for their tuition, and the college funds we had for them covered everything else, and they get to keep the excess.\n\nI told our kids that they need to thank their grandfather and we will be visiting him to do so. He still can recall and recognize them. They were against it, they wish to have no part of his and generally think I am a POS for still having a positive relationship with my father despite his views. They talk more to their mother, I get all my updates through her. After much fighting my wife was able to convince them to come. Let us say it was a complete shit show. My children did not thank him, they yelled and ridiculed him. \n\nWe had a huge fight, and they told me what else did I expect to happen.\n\nWas I in the wrong to try and force a thank you out of my kids? Should I have just left well enough alone?\n\nThank you for the replies, and information. I am going to speak with my wife but I plan to cut them off from their grandfather's money and the money we set aside for them. I know I cannot force them to repay the money they took, but I can remove their access to the money. I will also be taking back their cars and looking into selling them. Going to stop paying their rent, and revoke their access to our joint credit cards, and phone plan. More or less I am done subsidizing their lifestyle. \n\nYes, I understand a thank you is meaningless to most people without intent. The thing is my father is suffering from serve cognitive decline. For better or worse and not to sound like an ass he will not even notice the lack of intent. He would have appreciated it. If they were willing to compromise their morals by taking the money, they could have done the same to say thank you. Probably going to stop reading at this point. I know I failed as a father and my kids are a reflection of me. I am disappointed in myself as a father. I failed to raise them better.\n\nMorbid curiosity at this point. The sum was not small. My dad was getting worse he could no longer stay home. He wanted to leave behind a lasting legacy so he wanted to pay for his grandkids tuition cause he never could do that for me. So we sold the house and split the funds down the middle for the kids. They got close to 300k each. That is what I meant by saying I will ensure the money is used for their tuition. I did not use the money to pay for his care. I covered that out of my pocket. \n\nWhen the time came I did inform them their grandfather set aside money for their education. I informed them they have money we have set aside for them to go to school so they did not need to use his money. We told them you can use their grandfather's money for tuition and they could use our money for everything else, or just use our money. \n\nTo the best of my knowledge, my father was not a secret KKK leader or was part of some kill squad. He just had dated and damaging views and yes he did vocalize his political and world views but being as our kids stopped seeing him pretty young and he has been sick for a better part of their lives. I doubt he is even aware of their worldviews. My children are more liberally aligned, and I do understand why they feel the way they do toward him. Still, they had no reason to act the way they did.\n\nIdk why I keep doing this. I am putting it down after this. I know failed as a parent I did not do a good enough job teaching them you say thank you when someone does something nice for them. \n\nI am glad to read a lot of these comments to know I am not the only parent that failed at teaching this lesson.", "created_utc": 1692371114, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15un1nm/aita_for_telling_my_kids_they_have_to_thank_their/", "score": 1338, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re being punished for displaying empathy to a man in obvious decline. You\u2019re unfairly being judged guilty solely by association without consideration to the context.

In social contracts, taking something freely given (like a gift) obligates a thank you. You can hate the giver and hate the gift, but once you take it, it's polite to say thank you. This could have been simple and done with, but they decided to blow the situation up and now will have a hard lesson about gifts. I don't mean to minimize the money by calling it a gift but rather to empathize that it was given freely with no strings attached by someone terribly flawed who loves them.\n\nI think people forget about grace in situations like this. Grandpa has horrible views and, as a result, didn't see his grandchildren whom he apparently loved. Now he's got cognitive decline and will most likely die without ever having contact with the grandkids again. He did it to himself, but that's also plain sad.

But I still am nice to her and say thank you every time she does something for me like buy me groceries and takes me to dinner. I take her random places and help her do stuff, I am the only grandchild out of 16 that she sees and I do it simply because my mother asks me too. Your children are entitled assholes. You NTA", "IDK, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a terrible thing to thank someone for a gift (even if you dislike them).  And if you REALLY dislike them, politely decline the gift.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for expecting your kids to be *at the very least* gracious.  Hopefully y\u2019all can find ways to mend some fences.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry, OP. I hear a lot of pain in your words. It's hard to realize that your kids are not the people you thought or hoped they would be. A simple thank you is the bare minimum of polite behavior and the fact that your kids wouldn't even do that  must be hard to bear.\n\nI think you're doing the right thing by cutting them off. You will get furious backlash from them, but please stay strong - they behaved terribly.", "NTA. I couldnt scream at a helpless old man losing his marbles.\n\nI would say, thanks grandpa for paying for my education, this is what I am doing, I am enjoying it, I plan to use my education to get into this line of work, I appreciate your contribution to my future.\n\nLong game is, if you plan to spend your life in the view that all.people are equal, you are far better off doing that from a place of prosperity (secure housing, comfortable lifestyle, savings). Surely paying for such a lifestyle with a bigots money is the best form of living well is the best revenge?\n\nOP's kids are cruel, selfish, and short sighted. I say this as a person with a family full of assholes- what in my life do you think I would have if I couldn't suck it up and be gracious to assholes who gave me shit? I wouldn't have a home for damn sure. Loads of queer people have a similar experience.", "i say thank you to my moms abusive ex whenever he sends me money.\n\nbecause it\u2019s a gift and you should say thank you. my mama raised me correctly. but all he gets is a thank you, nothing else. NTA", "This breaks my heart, our national partisan chasm splitting up a family. Your kids sound old enough to accept that manners dictate at least a thank you. Shame on them, their ignorant stubbornness will end up costing them dearly. NTA", "Look if someone accepts money from racist/LGBTQ+fobic/sexist people and donates it to organizations dedicated to fight racism, LGBTQ+fobia, sexism and/or pedophilia I applaud them. Heck, I respect the choice of even using it for a lavish gay wedding or some selfish purpose. \n\nThat said, no need to insult the person though, just say \"thank you\" politely and move on with dismantling the oppression they value so much, being rude to people does not make a point. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAlso, man is at the end of his life and has dementia, the ship to change his views kind of sailed, so just be nice to him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "He doesn't seem to have ever forced them to have any kind of relationship to his dad given how he knows about his views and doesn't support them. He doesn't expect them to be nice to racists or tolerate those views. He just wanted them to say thank you to an old man with dementia because they took his money. They instead seem to have gone and berated an old man who's not all there for his hateful views. An old man who seems to love said grandkids and was likely very hurt by this. Which in turn deeply hurts their own father who still loves his dad.\n\n\nHis hateful views aren't OK, and shouldn't be tolerated.  But they took his money and all they had to do was to say a meaningless thank you to an old man who isn't all there and then go right back to being disgusted by him. If not for him then for their dad who seems to do a whole lot for them without asking for much. He isn't forcing a relationship here just badgering for one interaction which would have made his dad happy in his decline.", "Yeah so much of this is very extreme, it really comes down to\nIt's ok for my father to say these things, ill still love him even though it hurts my kids, but if they react in kind I will cut them off from my support.\n\nI get stopping the grandfather from supporting them, but yourself aswell?\n\nAs someone who has had to lie about who I am to appease my grandparents, and sit there while they vomited bigoted views - its fucking hard. Now I did it for sure, sat there and pretended that it didn't deeply hurt me. But fuck it's one sided", "But do we know they just took it or was it set up in a bank account for them by the parents?", "Yup I\u2019m so curious what vile things he downplayed as \u2018political views\u2019", "Ding ding ding!! Everyone is hemming and hawing over a thanks. What did grandpa DO AND SAY? Respect your elders is bullshit. But you\u2019re blood is bullshit. If you\u2019re not a wild asshole people won\u2019t call you one.", ">Like a parent whose spouse abuses their child, that says/knows that the abuse is wrong & that they disagree with it, but does what they can to minimize or ignore it.\n\nNo, a spouse abusing a child is actively causing harm. A dying old man in cognitive decline spouting bigoted things (probably in the confines of a nursing home) is at most a nuisance. He is not in any kind of a position of power.\n\nLet's also remember that this grandfather gave the grandkids a lot of money. Would you accept a lot of money from a bigot? If not, good for you for sticking to your values, but to OP's kids, his views can't be that big of a deal if they'll take his money.", "Stop sugarcoat that, else you gonna eat those too with all the funds provided.", "Then dont take their money and accept their help wth? It seems extremely hypocritical that you\u2019ll keep ties with someone only when you need them, and then not have the guts to thank them. And they did fold for money. They did just that. They accepted him and his money when it affected them. If you draw the line at thanking someone but have no problem with their views when its about accpeting their money, then honestly, youre no better than them.", "I actually don\u2019t think we should extend kindness to people who actively harm oppressed groups", "Kind of off-topic, but do you think she was neurospicy and maybe struggled to read cues?", "I'm not saying it supports that person. I'm saying if somebody gives you $300,000 you say thank you. Or you don't take it. \n\nI mean he didn't really ask them to do anything that they disagree with. It's not like he asked them to protest outside the local chapter of planned Parenthood! But show some manners. He's going to be gone soon and they're going to go about their lives doing whatever. Plus there's the fact that with his cognitive decline he's not really going to completely grasp what's going on anyway. So it's not like they can even change his mind at this point.", "It says they yelled at him and verbally attacked him, I think", "But your comment did imply that taking the money was in some way at odds with hating him. My point was that it wasn't, not that it had anything to do with saying thank you.", "All of the \u201cTotally cool to want your kids to be superficially gracious and spinelessly tolerant of irredeemable people with abhorrent beliefs that fundamentally dehumanize them and others for *more* money and of course, punish and shame them for refusing. How dare they not feign empty, disingenuous platitudes, why didn\u2019t you raise them better\u201d comments can kick rocks and eat my fucking shorts. \n\nThose kids have integrity and I hope that never changes despite OP\u2019s best efforts as a dog shit parent.", "Yea I cut mine off for similar behavior.", ">Those kids have integrity\n\nNot enough to refuse the bigots' money, of course, but just the barest crumb of it to not say two words.", "At first I thought I was reading the wrong comments ready to fight lol you can cut someone off and if they send a gift you can accept it without returning it as that would be contact but these people don't seem to understand that. Did they go take the money straight from his hands? No the dad technically gave it to them all these other people are so delusional and the father just as bad I'm taking everything away because you didn't say thank you it's infuriating"]}
