So I think it is fair to say thank you.", "If my Nazi grampa gifted me an education and I accepted it, yes, I'd thank my grandpa.\n\nWould I accept it? I guess It'd depend on the circumstances but probably not.", "You're missing the part where they don't have to have a relationship with him. The unethical part of accepting money from a dickbag is usually the ongoing relationship that is implied. But here there is none. So yeah, take the money.\n\nYou clearly skipped replying about Elon...", "lol so this is all about you being petty at the expense of your kids future because they wont play nice with a bigot", "INFO: are your kids gay or liberal or whatever it is that he doesn't like? because I'm willing to bet they've undergone years of mistreatment from him for it. And if that's the case, they're likely looking at the money as reparations. In that case, YTA and you should NOT force them to give back a gift. And if they're 18, you definitely can't force them to do anything.", "it's just my opinion.", "ad homenims do not add to any real conversation and name calling is childish.", "i absolutely hate a bigot and i feel strongly about it. i hate it to the point that i wouldn't take their money. those are my ethics. you don't have to agree.", "A thank you is a string attached? I did not think a Thank you would be such an issue. It is two words.", "They were never mistreated. He never viewed them in a negative light. They cut him out because of his views. Not because he treated them poorly.", "It is a thank you . . . How is that petty?", "The grandfather is a bigot, but taking the bigots money makes the grandkids bigots by association.", "Liberal, and no they did not go years if mistreatment. My dad was just vocal about his views of the world. He never aimed any of his views at them.", "Okay but what's the justification? \n\nThis sub is all for people doing exactly what's in a will with money or doing exactly what is legally justified, except in this specific instance. What if the guy died and the kids couldn't thank him, could they take the money then?", "Like I give a shit what someone who defends a bigot thinks.", "and I hate them to the point that i'd prefer every one broke af\n\n&#x200B;\n\nok I don't agree so why remain here on my thread trying to shove your ethics into my views?", "It is two untruthful words that they had to travel to say, and had to look at the man who thinks they're less than because of his \"views.\" Those are strings.", "Exactly.", "Maybe to them It's some kind of reparation for what he has said", "If someone is constantly talking about something that makes you who you are, and spewing venom, trust me, it hurts. And just because you've never heard a conversation about this doesn't mean it didn't happen. \n\nHearing \"liberals are all evil people\" is still painful even if he's not saying \"you're a liberal and you're evil.\" \nHearing \"gay and trans people are all groomers\" is still painful even if he's not saying \"your gay and trans friends are all groomers.\" \n\nBut that's not something that you're prepared to accept as fact, even though your kids have likely tried to get you to understand, so I can't fix it. I hope you find some compassion for them, even if everyone is about to tell you with limited information that you are n t a.", "i never defended him. i said, they shouldn't take his money. why are you so angry about that?", "well, this is social media and it's a forum where people weigh in and give their opinions, so that's what i'm doing here. if you don't like that, you def shouldn't be on reddit at all. lastly, aren't you \"shoving\" your opinions around?", "He does not think less of them, they are his grandkids. You can hold views for one party and still love another within the said party. We are humans, thus hypocrisy and logical inconsistency is woven throughout are very being.\n\nThat said a thank you is not much to ask.", "I am fully aware of this, my point is if that was the case why accept his money? They had our college fund not like they needed his.\n\nI figured I raised better kids that if you take something from someone you should say thank you. I was wrong in this case.", "You do realize the exact statement can be reiterated to you, right? You're the one that said \"those are my ethics. you don't have to agree.\" so either you wanna be called on your fight for the \"rights\" of bigots which is a support of bigotry or you dont and could leave the convo. Which one do you want me to operate under the belief of as your decision?", "Re-read my other comments to you and you will see that I answered this question. Reparations, for one. \n\nAnd they should say thank you when they mean it, not be blindly polite. I'm sorry that those two little words were enough for you to think that your children aren't good people.", "you may chose to argue if you like. i respect your opinion. when i said, you don't have to agree with me. i meant it. i'm in no way fighting for this man's rights."]}
