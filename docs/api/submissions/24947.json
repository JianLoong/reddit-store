He loves his grandchildren far more than me. I am currently his guardian he suffers from serve cognitive decline. Before his decline getting worse he informed me he wished to pay for their tuition. So I made sure to do that. So my father paid for their tuition, and the college funds we had for them covered everything else, and they get to keep the excess.\n\nI told our kids that they need to thank their grandfather and we will be visiting him to do so. He still can recall and recognize them. They were against it, they wish to have no part of his and generally think I am a POS for still having a positive relationship with my father despite his views. They talk more to their mother, I get all my updates through her. After much fighting my wife was able to convince them to come. Let us say it was a complete shit show. My children did not thank him, they yelled and ridiculed him. \n\nWe had a huge fight, and they told me what else did I expect to happen.\n\nWas I in the wrong to try and force a thank you out of my kids? Should I have just left well enough alone?\n\nThank you for the replies, and information. I am going to speak with my wife but I plan to cut them off from their grandfather's money and the money we set aside for them. I know I cannot force them to repay the money they took, but I can remove their access to the money. I will also be taking back their cars and looking into selling them. Going to stop paying their rent, and revoke their access to our joint credit cards, and phone plan. More or less I am done subsidizing their lifestyle. \n\nYes, I understand a thank you is meaningless to most people without intent. The thing is my father is suffering from serve cognitive decline. For better or worse and not to sound like an ass he will not even notice the lack of intent. He would have appreciated it. If they were willing to compromise their morals by taking the money, they could have done the same to say thank you. Probably going to stop reading at this point. I know I failed as a father and my kids are a reflection of me. I am disappointed in myself as a father. I failed to raise them better.\n\nMorbid curiosity at this point. The sum was not small. My dad was getting worse he could no longer stay home. He wanted to leave behind a lasting legacy so he wanted to pay for his grandkids tuition cause he never could do that for me. So we sold the house and split the funds down the middle for the kids. They got close to 300k each. That is what I meant by saying I will ensure the money is used for their tuition. I did not use the money to pay for his care. I covered that out of my pocket. \n\nWhen the time came I did inform them their grandfather set aside money for their education. I informed them they have money we have set aside for them to go to school so they did not need to use his money. We told them you can use their grandfather's money for tuition and they could use our money for everything else, or just use our money. \n\nTo the best of my knowledge, my father was not a secret KKK leader or was part of some kill squad. He just had dated and damaging views and yes he did vocalize his political and world views but being as our kids stopped seeing him pretty young and he has been sick for a better part of their lives. I doubt he is even aware of their worldviews. My children are more liberally aligned, and I do understand why they feel the way they do toward him. Still, they had no reason to act the way they did.", "created_utc": 1692371114, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15un1nm/aita_for_telling_my_kids_they_have_to_thank_their/", "score": 673, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also respect that they do not wish to have a relationship with him. \n\nWhat I am saying is they took his money knowing who he is. Say, thank you. That said it is a big deal but he is my father I am not going to abandon and leave him because he has horrible worldviews, in the grand scheme him being my father that is sick and needs care trumps any view he may have.", "It is more so the fact they showed up just to be disrespectful to their grandfather that paid for their education. Is why I am taking the money away. I rather have it donated.", "If the kids had such principles and did not like the ugly that grandpa spewed, then they should not have taken the money. This wasn't a desperate, only chance to go to school situation. The parents had tuition handled. \n\nThe thing about having principles and boundaries is that they mean nothing if you don't stick to them. In social contracts, taking something freely given (like a gift) obligates a thank you. You can hate the giver and hate the gift, but once you take it, it's polite to say thank you. This could have been simple and done with, but they decided to blow the situation up and now will have a hard lesson about gifts. I don't mean to minimize the money by calling it a gift but rather to empathize that it was given freely with no strings attached by someone terribly flawed who loves them.\n\nI think people forget about grace in situations like this. Grandpa has horrible views and, as a result, didn't see his grandchildren whom he apparently loved. Now he's got cognitive decline and will most likely die without ever having contact with the grandkids again. He did it to himself, but that's also plain sad. Some people don't realize the consequences until they're too late. The kids haven't realized the consequences of compromising their principles for money and not saying a simple thank you, even if insincere, but they will now.", "I would take the money and use some myself and then donate the rest to organizations and people who the grandpa is so against. I don't get these kind of people's though process Like all you had to do was say thank you for like 300k of free money. You could have used it for any kind of good you wanted to anything that grandpa was against but these children were clearly dumb brats and lost the opportunity to support for what they so called believe in.", "They could, but they could have also said thank you. \n\nSeems like the kids ruined their lives.", "That's another odd part to me; the first time they're saying \"thank you\" is seemingly well after they've graduated college? Not when the money was bequeathed, not when they started school, not at graduation?\n\nIf that's the case, damn. But more likely they have said thank you, in which case how many times do you have to say thank you for a gift? It's an expensive gift, but still a gift and the money was used exactly as the grandfather intended.", "100!", "I suppose you could call it justified assholery. Being disingenuous isn't nice, but sometimes it's what you need to do to until you're in a position to distance yourself from a toxic relationship.", "Respect and gratefulness are two different things.

He sucks because he both never confronted the father on the views which has lead to him asking his kids to say thank you to a man they clearly despise, and yet was shocked it went poorly.\n\n\nI dont think theres anything wrong accepting the money and putting it to better use. I have an elderly relative I no longer speak to because of their similar views, I will also receive an inheritance from them \"because family\". I will make donations to various charities they would hate with some of it, and live my best life with whatever little is left. \n\nBut the kids suck for berating an old man thats cognitively declined.

I\u2019m seriously a bit shocked at these comments. The man spewed hatred constantly per OP. The children heard it. They felt it. It hurt them. His words without a doubt impacted them. The man most definitely harassed some minorities too-they *always* do so he most definitely didn\u2019t just do nothing but hold hateful views of multiple minority groups. We have seen numerous Reddit posts where the majority consensus is to tell LGBT+ folks, for example, to keep theirs mouths shut until grandma and grandpa bigot pass so they can keep the generational wealth. Have people not seen how terrible the economy is? It\u2019s worth shutting up to get ahead when you\u2019d start at the bottom otherwise. People are having to work three jobs and still don\u2019t have food. Housing is in crisis. You suck up your pride when life can get rough if you don\u2019t. Now, OP is going to attempt to make his kids go in debt to pay back money already given to them, cut them off, take their cars, remove their health insurance, etc all because they won\u2019t say thank you to a bigot who was cruel throughout their entire lives? He comments about how his father remembers the kids and it makes him so happy to see them so they should visit, but why? He would actually **hate** them if his mind was still fully functional, and they know it. He hates everything about who they are. OP is gonna take these comments to heart (he is escalating revenge it seems as he reads more comments), and lose every single one of his kids for a man that would likely eradicate a large majority of people that exist if he could.", "It sounds like OP has power of attorney to make decisions for his fathers estate. This is fairly common in patients with cognitive decline.", "In what world do you need to tell someone they should thank someone, especially for something so large?", "How do I speak about my wife?", "if they are a good person, or even a neutral person, sure. but your father was a hateful bigot per your own words who has said things you believe would have directly impacted your kids. just because he did something nice for them, doesn't erase that, and doesn't mean they have to be thankful because he decided to do one good thing. why is it fine for them to lie to his face about being thankful, but not wanting to engage with him at all is somehow a problem?", "This guy nazis", "**Literally the first sentence of the post**\n\nFucking lol", "I will absolutely play nice to get that inheritance off any old prick relative (not that I have any) but forcing the kids to play nice when it isn't needed is mad.\n\nBeing vindictive and trying to ruin their lives for not playing nice just ensures that the hate towards that paternal lineage is carrying on.\n\nLike fuck imagine if one of the kids is struck off health insurance and gets something that becomes a pre existing condition going forward.\n\nImagine how gleeful the op will be.", "Yes BUT powers to make gifts from the estate are limited to those that the person would reasonably have made themselves.

It's not like he baked them a cake and demanded forgiveness. \n\nIf the kids can swallow their pride and overlook their values to accept his money, they can do the same to say a simple thank you, or risk having the money flow stopped.

Lol come on.", "I automatically thought of the post I linked below which is why I\u2019m so shocked people are pissed at the kids. OP is gonna go nuclear over a post on a sub that has differentiating answers depending on the people who first comment. When hateful people hold power over you, and you\u2019re only way to get ahead is to be silent, I say do it. Pride won\u2019t keep you fed. Pride won\u2019t get you educated. Pride sure as hell won\u2019t get you housing or health insurance. Imagine if he does cut his kiddos of healthcare then suddenly one gets diabetes or something.

They were fine without it! OP has stated that repeatedly! This is a situation of spoiled kids who, given the first opportunity, went back on their principles for money. The money was given with no strings. All they needed to do was provide a simple, mealy mouthed, insincere thank you but, suddenly their principles came roaring back in place once they had the money. \n\nThe kids advised to keep quiet are usually advised to do that because the situation might not be safe or their silence might be their ticket to freedom! Silence may literally be their only way out. How do people not get that? \n\nI do understand that these viewpoints can be highly hypocritical, but we're also talking about privilege and opportunity. Some people don't have the luxury of turning down that kind of money to make their lives better. Some people need to keep quiet about their orientation to get out safely. OP's kids are and were not in any type of hardship", "Did you just assume my view points because I'm on reddit?

But they only want to get angry after it no longer affected them. This is real world, you're going to have to do things you don't like. If they can't pay the price of a thank you for 300k, they better not be angry when it's gone. \nNews flash: just because someone is evil they can do nice things.. it doesn't make them a good person\nAnd vice versa a nice person can do bad things, doesn't make them an evil person.  You still say thank you if someone does a life changing nice things for you", "Except... he's dying and won't be spending the money anyway.", "I agree, they are hypocrites.\n\nBut like I said \"to them\" it's another angle which I tried to explain in my edit.
