He loves his grandchildren far more than me. I am currently his guardian he suffers from serve cognitive decline. Before his decline getting worse he informed me he wished to pay for their tuition. So I made sure to do that. So my father paid for their tuition, and the college funds we had for them covered everything else, and they get to keep the excess.\n\nI told our kids that they need to thank their grandfather and we will be visiting him to do so. He still can recall and recognize them. They were against it, they wish to have no part of his and generally think I am a POS for still having a positive relationship with my father despite his views. They talk more to their mother, I get all my updates through her. After much fighting my wife was able to convince them to come. Let us say it was a complete shit show. My children did not thank him, they yelled and ridiculed him. \n\nWe had a huge fight, and they told me what else did I expect to happen.\n\nWas I in the wrong to try and force a thank you out of my kids? Should I have just left well enough alone?\n\nThank you for the replies, and information. I am going to speak with my wife but I plan to cut them off from their grandfather's money and the money we set aside for them. I know I cannot force them to repay the money they took, but I can remove their access to the money. I will also be taking back their cars and looking into selling them. Going to stop paying their rent, and revoke their access to our joint credit cards, and phone plan. More or less I am done subsidizing their lifestyle. \n\nYes, I understand a thank you is meaningless to most people without intent. The thing is my father is suffering from serve cognitive decline. For better or worse and not to sound like an ass he will not even notice the lack of intent. He would have appreciated it. If they were willing to compromise their morals by taking the money, they could have done the same to say thank you. Probably going to stop reading at this point. I know I failed as a father and my kids are a reflection of me. I am disappointed in myself as a father.

I get it you think I am leaving some deep dark secret that my father was a leader of the KKK. Or had a shire \nmade to Hitler. He was just an old man with some extremely dated and damaging worldviews.", "How does that change the judgement...?\n\n\nIf they hate him so much, why take his money?", "A video call for paying for all their college tuition? Why are we trying to make this easier on the kids? They got a free ride to school and saying thank you in person is too much to ask?", "50/50 unless the wife pops onto this post and adds her 2 cents.", "No, it's my fault for misreading you.   Sorry I rushed to judgment.", "Well I think this works out for the best. You don't have to deal with ungrateful kids and they don't have to deal with all the -ists.", "The word reparations is entirely unsuitable to this. \u201cThis person was shitty to me, so I deserve something to make up for that\u201d is not what reparations are or should be. It\u2019s obviously a complicated issue with a whole lot of angles that I won\u2019t get into, but the difference I think is most appropriate is that reparations don\u2019t cover what a single person did to a small group of people. One idea is that if something is systemically done or continues to be done that hurts a group, not only in the form of immediate and obvious harm but also by denying them access to institutions and the ability to establish themselves in the society, then it makes sense to hold that society or its inheritor responsible for attempting to rectify at least a small part of that damage. \nWhat you\u2019re suggesting is much closer to compensation and that gets trickier since that\u2019s a more established legal construct and generally being a disgusting, cruel asshole, unless it results in actual monetary damages, generally cannot be use as grounds for extracting compensation. Racism and bigotry in all its forms should not be tolerated, but that\u2019s very different from suggesting that a monetary award is an appropriate remedy to individual cases of bigotry in general.", "What. Did. He. Do. You are trying so hard to protect him. I get it. He is your dad. You love him because he is your dad. But he screwed up somewhere, and you know it.  \n\nEdit to add, since you edited yours: No, I'm not thinking he had any KKK connections. I'm thinking more he started a fight. Or he insulted family.

Bye.", "How old are the kids? I'm not trying to excuse behavior, but I never made the best choices even 4-5 years ago when I was 19-20. I do understand your sentiment and reasoning though, I feel maybe you could really try to sit down the kids and explain that while you understand their reasoning to anger, no one is entitled to anyone's money, even more so if they're taking money from someone they hate. If I had college completely paid for even by someone I completely despise and could seeing life being better without, if they told me they'd cover that entire 50,000-120,000 check and all I had to do was make a 5 minute Facebook video of how great of a person they are and how appreciated they are in my life, right as rain I'd do it. \n\nPride is almost never more important, imo than improving the lives of yourself or others around you if it doesn't harm anyone or anything else besides your own Pride.\n\nWould you still be open to possible reconciliation after this happened?", "mm, nah, I think scamming bigots is fine. doesn't make you nearly as bad as an actual bigot.", "You are unhinged, lol"]}
