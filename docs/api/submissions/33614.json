If your mom for issues with your sister, she is the one who should tell it to her face. Your mom is a coward and doesn't have the guts to tell your sister she is not wanted. You should cut your mother out of your life.", "NTA for refusing to participate in your family's devious scheme and being square with your older sister.", "NTA\n\nTelling the sister everything would be the right thing to do.\n\nThen inviting her or doing something extra to make up for the shit she's being put through would be an extra kindness that could be afforded to someone being mistreated if you so wish.", "Tell them to do their own dirty work. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all, your mom's and younger sister's behavior is super odd and rude. Did your mom ever give any reason for why she couldn't tell your older sister herself that she's uninvited? Are they usually like this?", "NTA. Please don\u2019t do this. My grandmother did that to my dad because his brother didn\u2019t want him at a BBQ and it was just awful to witness and I can\u2019t even imagine how it must have felt for it to be done to my Dad and in this case your sister.", "NTA your family is trying to use you as a pawn in whatever family drama is happening", "NTA", "So you were having separate plans completely, and they still tried to get you to be the bad guy? Nope, NTA", "NTA: your mother should be direct with your sister. Having you as the intercessor is a technique of unhealthy behavior called triangulation. Good for you for not only keeping out of it but warning your sister.", "NTA- It shouldn't be up to you to get involved in whatever drama they have. If they don't want your sister there, they need to do the dirty work. And I gather you aren't visiting them as it sounds like they are trying to pawn sister off on you? That definitely means you shouldn't be getting involved.", "NTA. If they don't want your sister there at christmas, let them grow a pair and tell her themselves. The fact they feel uncomfortable telling her themselves means they're aware of how unkind they're being and trying to get you to do it on their behalf in order not to deal with it.\n\nGood for you for sticking for her and informing her!", "NTA.\n\nThey had an issue with her coming? It's the hosts responsibility to manage the guest list - not try and scapegoat someone else into doing it. Your mother is (in theory) a grown woman who can talk with her own words.\n\nUnless there are issues relating to her ability to communicate, there is no excuse or reason you have to do your mothers dirty work. It's one thing if there was a language barrier, or if your mother was mute and your sister didn't believe in text-based communication, but I highly doubt that's the case here.\n\nI'd invite your sister to your place and have a grand ol time without them. Never to late to start new traditions! Old traditions are just peer pressure from dead people, anyways.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
