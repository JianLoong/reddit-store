A little difficult with 2 small kids but, I'm a full time mom so I can do it and I don't mind because I know he has so much fun.\n\nMy husband left early (4am) on Thursday to go visit his family. I took care of our 1yo and 3yo by myself until he got back into town on Sunday afternoon. \n\nMy 3yo had been missing daddy and wanted to go see him \"at his airport\". So after nap time on Sunday, I packed the kids in the car, drove the 20 minutes to the airport and waited at the gate as a surprise for him! (He drove our other car and parked at the airport.)\n\nHe had also been texting me and video chat the whole time telling me how much fun he was having with his parents and brother, but that he missed me and the kids way more than he thought he would. \n\nHe was surprised alright. Got a really cute video of kids running at their dad.\n\nBut his reaction was also less than enthusiastic. I asked him if it was a good surprise. He said \" it was a surprising surprise\". Then we get into the car so I can drive him over to the economy lot where he is parked and 3yo wanted to ride home with dad. He says \"I really didn't want you to be here\". Like wtf am I supposed to say to that? And he just says he'll explain more later. \n\nWell I'm fuming the whole car ride home without him and when we get back to the house I am quite l, fearing I'm going to say to say something I regret in anger if I speak. He can tell.\n\nHe just says \"I can't come home to this, just talk to me\". I tell him to explain what he meant by his earlier comment of not wanting us there and he said he was just tired and sweaty from being in a cramped airplane for three hours and was just ready for the travel experience to be done with. \n\nI'm still angry. \n\nI say \" well was it a good surprise? Because you said it was just a surprising surprise\". He pauses and says \"it was good, I just didn't expect it\". I roll my eyes... *that's what suprise is* \n\nI ask him to take back what he said at the airport, and he did. But like it still hurt. \n\nMaybe I could have handled it better. I guess I do know he doesn't like surprises so maybe I'm an asshole for trying to set up a good one with what I thought were pretty low steaks. Maybe I'm the Ahole for not taking into consideration his mental state after just spending 3 hours on a plane (that the AC was broken on). Maybe I'm not the Ahole and he always tells me to watch what I say because sometimes it can't be taken back and this time it was him. \n\nIdk.

You're right that your kids being at the airport is low stakes. It's not a surprise birthday party, it's your family. \n\nEdit: AND he's just been away for a fun trip, while you've been parenting your kids alone - I'm not sure that he gets to be grumpy in this situation.", "I don\u2019t get these responses.  Of course you are upset.  You have looked after the kids while he gets a trip, one of two per year, and his response is he didn\u2019t want to see you at the airport?  Because he\u2019s hot and doesn\u2019t like surprises?  Boo hoo.  It was a shitty thing to say and I think you should send him with the kids next time or let him come home to an empty house while you and kids do something fun.  No more favourite dinners upon his return.", "NTA \n\nYou were being sweet. Your little one wanted to see dad! And your husband was telling you how much he missed the kids\u2026 \n\nYou have every right to be pissed. Im sure you\u2019ve had to jump right into parenting during times when you\u2019re tired, and stressed, and sweaty. And I\u2019d bet you don\u2019t make your discontent visible to the kids. And he wasn\u2019t even being asked to jump into the work of parenting, the excited hugs and \u201cI love you\u201d *is the fun part*. I really hope I\u2019m misunderstanding and he didn\u2019t say that he really didn\u2019t want you there in front of the kids. If I am understanding correctly then he was *completely* out of line.", "NTA - a 3 hour flight is really not all that long. Can't even watch 2 modern movies during that time. Its a weird thing to say that he didn't want you to be there after telling you he misses you and the kids.", "NTA. \n\nIt should not even be a surprise, a father can expect his children at an certain age to want to go to the airport to pick him up. It's a small adventure and it makes the waiting so much easier on them. And a father should be thrilled to see his kids running up to him after 4 days. Not annoyed. \n\nI've had shitty flights, coming home really tired, dreading the ride home. Seeing my wife and kids there was such a happy moment for me.\n\nAnd jfc, it was only a 3 hours flight. Come on...\n\nThe \"i really didn't want you to be here\" makes me wonder what's going on. It's highly disrespectfull to you.  It's also oddly specific. It's almost if something had to happen at the airport before he was ready to go home and see his family again.\n\nJust took a look at a previous post of you. Yes, there's more going on here.", "NTA OP! I don\u2019t understand the Y T A votes here. You did a very sweet, small thing. Yes, he does not really like surprises but this was not an elaborate birthday party with 150 people and a big band. You took his children, that he missed (and that missed him) to see him when he got off a plane. The man was slightly uncomfortable for three hours (boo fcking hoo) and therefore could not bring himself to be happy to see his wife and children? Even if he did not like the surprise very much, it is really hurtful for him to say that he did not want you there. Of course you are upset, this feels like a huge rejection.\n\nEdit: people are saying he wanted to destress on the way home in the car and that you should have understood that. The man was on a FUN trip with his family, without his kids. This should have been relaxing enough don\u2019t you think?", "Info: How does he pick you up from your twice yearly solo vacations? Do the kids ever want to go with him when he picks you up?  \n\n\nOr is this just a special treat for him and you can just be happy to serve with a smile?", "So I think your husband\u2019s behavior was rude and hurtful, but I suspect that I think more the way you do than than your husband. I think you\u2019re NTA, but the perspectives from the surprise hating grumpy travelers have certainly been enlightening. It would never have occurred to me either to be able to understand that point of view without all the feedback I\u2019ve seen on your post.", "NTA \n\nBut travel can be stressful, telling him you were coming could've prepared him for this. Some people are fussy travelers, or want their alone time getting coffee after they land or whatever, he probably was just surprised to see you there. Not everyone likes surprises, some people want predictability and structure.", ">*low steaks*\n\nLol\n\nNTA overall\u2014 but I can appreciate your husband\u2019s point of view. I fly a decent amount and I hate it every time. I\u2019m not anxious about flying itself, but all of the accompanying *travel* bullshit; waiting in lines, sitting around, sitting next to gross strangers in a stuffy metal tube, arranging accommodations, rentals, checking/picking up baggage, etc. I generally get a bit cranky at the end of a days\u2019 flights. I feel spent, like I can\u2019t handle too many more things that demand my attention. Usually I just want to get home and decompress for a bit.\n\nSo what your husband said makes sense to me.", "NTA at all. Oh, a little kid wanted to meet their dad the airport, the horror! Your husband should just have been nice about that and \u0175ent home together. It's not like he was asked to take a crying child to the dentist right after his flight. Just a hug, a kiss and that's all. It's such a small and easy thing that I don't get what's his deal at all.", "NTA. I hate surprises, traveled a lot with work and know what it takes to pack up and get young kids ready to go anywhere. I would have been absolutely overjoyed if you did that for me. That someone would think of that, love someone enough to bother, I would have been reenergised and ecstatic to see the kids running towards me with you proudly looking on. Good on you, I\u2019m sorry he didn\u2019t appreciate your thoughtful gesture. I do if it\u2019s any consolation.", "Your NTA, but you expected him to act and feel a certain way then got angry because he isn't living up to your expectations. He was tired and cranky and probably wanted some down time, you wanted a happy loving reunion. Neither is wrong.", "Maybe your husband does not have the enough emotional capacity for a surprise so instead of the stereotypical \"Happy\" reaction that we anticipated, he might have felt \"worried\" or \"mildly irritated\" for he doesn't know how to react to a surprise. You might have brought him mental confusion and exhaustion.", "NTA\n\nAlso, there's no way the AC wasn't working on the airplane. At the altitude that passenger jets fly at, that's not just AC, it's *life support.* The only time it would normally be turned off is during take off and landing, in order to guarantee all available energy is diverted to the engines in case of emergency.", "NTA. How could you reasonably have offended him? His children wanted to see him at the airport and you brought them. I don't even understand his objection. Who cares if he was tired, no one was asking anything of him except a hug.", "As someone who travels and a dad who is a pilot, it\u2019s a process to prepare being back in a routine and from exhausting travel plans. I don\u2019t think he meant it rudely but he was probably mentally preparing for his upcoming week and as you said he doesn\u2019t like surprises. And traveling on a packed plane with no AC is not a joke. It\u2019s horrific. He wasn\u2019t trying to insult you or hurt your feelings. \n\nHowever you have a right to be upset. You wanted to do something cute and nice and your child was asking for dad but he didn\u2019t respond in the way you wanted. I just hope you\u2019re not more upset because the video wasn\u2019t as good with his expression. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is the AH but just a difference of agreement. You both could of handled it differently but I totally get where both sides are coming from.", "He doesn't like surprises.\n\nAs a person who also does not like surprises, I understand how he felt when a sudden change of what he thought his last trek of the exhausting travel home would look like. \n\nSome people are just like that. \nWe need things to be unsurprising. \n\nIt's not that he wasn't looking forward to seeing you guys, but he was tired, he was planning to mentally charge up on the drive home before he had to interact with people. \n\nNAH", "NTA - were you expected to tell a 3yo that they can\u2019t go see Daddy at the airport after he\u2019s been a way for 3 days and nights (long time for littles) because Daddy doesn\u2019t like surprises? And don\u2019t most 3-6 yo\u2019s love the airport, watching planes take off and land? Your husband is TA for having a great weekend with his birth family and then having no patience for the family he created, with you. Forgive him but he should be more grateful for all he has with you three.", "NTA I dont think you did anything wrong OP. What you did is not out of the ordinary nor is it extremely demanding for your husband. It was honestly very normal and not over the top at all? I really dont get his comment. I fly often and I understand that flights can be hard but what kind of reaction is this? And then hes telling you \"I cant come home to this\" when he was the one that caused it??? This wasnt a surprise birthday party, you just brought his children to see him. I think your reaction was justified, OP.", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s comment, \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to be here\u201d was way too harsh. Sounds like he didn\u2019t mean it though, as he took it back, but it\u2019s not a good thing to say in the first place. You\u2019ve been watching the kids while he\u2019s having fun, and you just wanted to greet him at the airport with the kids.\n\nI think what could benefit both of you is open discussion of what\u2019s not acceptable as a surprise, or any adjustments/accommodations either of you may need while traveling. Since you mention that your husband is also telling you to watch what you say, a discussion of how to approach disagreements could be good too, so you\u2019re both trying to create a win-win situation through proper communication and not tearing each other down.", "NTA. I get being hot, cranky and tired but surely the sight of your kids running towards you with a smile on their face\u2026 brings a smile to yours. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t normally say that one wants to wallow in the grumpiness, but it feels that way when he clearly says he didn\u2019t want to OP there.", "NAH you tried to do something sweet, and he really didn\u2019t want a lot of activity as he was tired and sweaty. You kind of knew he didn\u2019t like surprises but I\u2019m sure this seemed  different. I hope you can talk about it and let it go.", "NTA in no way shape or form. Excuse me? He thinks 3 hours is too much to bear? Try 24+ hour flights to visit relatives in Europe or North America from Australia. He had fun right? So wtf did he need to do/get up to at/from the airport that was so much more important than his wife or kids and that he possibly didn\u2019t want you to see or know about? I would get really sus if I were you.\n\nAt best he\u2019s a first class whinge bat.", "NTA but I can't stand being ambushed so see why he's pissed off too.", "I *hate* surprises. Always have, always will. \n\nBut if I was met at the airport with my kids after being away from them for a few days, I would be so happy. NTA at all.", "I live in a different country than my parents and siblings. I don't see them very often. When I return home after a visit I always feel quite sad and devastated at leaving them. It takes me a while to get back into my usual rythm. \n\nMaybe that is how this chap felt, too, and he thought he had the drive home to get back into the right head space.....", "NAH\n\nBut you need to please learn to trust your husband when he explains the meaning behind his words and to not take such remarks personally.\n\nIf he is tired and crappy from traveling, he will not be able to allocate enough energy to manage your feelings. You need to be in control of how you react to what he does or says. \n\nWhen you feel that something is bothering you and you don't have the option to clarify right away, tell yourself \"this is not about me\" and wait to be able to ask what he was thinking when the bothersome thing happened. But ask with the same tone as if you were at the dinner table asking him to pass the salt. If the explanation makes sense, believe him. If it doesn't make sense, tell him you're confused and ask him to help you make sense of it.\n\nTrusting that your husband is not purposefully trying to hurt you with his mistakes is crucial.", "Are we sure the side piece didn\u2019t have to jump into a bin?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't get me wrong, the suprise is cute- but that trip home from the airport could have been one-on-one time to discuss matters (without kids) or a chance to process things in his head.

That was unfortunate, but you getting mad and letting him see it was also unfortunate.\n\nI have sympathy for him because I remember needing winding-down time after a long drive before getting pounced on by the whole loud family.  And I remember having to learn how to communicate to everyone what I needed, and find ways to get it that didn't hurt people's feelings.  I think you should apologize to him.  I think you should start teaching your kids that part of respecting people's individual needs is that daddy needs quiet time after his trips.

That's EXACTLY what you have been doing for years with his travels. For days on this one. To think about how he felt, and during that time, being you the one taking care of everything.\n\nI think now it's up to him to give you a little credit, and understand that his children wanted to see him, that you wanted to see him too, and that his words implied that your presence would be welcomed.\n\nThat has not been? Ok. There can be many causes behind it. But he only has two options: hold back those feelings in orther to don't make you upset for it, if he doesn't want to explain himself after, and get carried away a little by the children's excitement, or clearly explain to you what has overwhelmed him to the point of making you feel unwelcome.\n\nIt's probably something so small that he's even embarrassed to verbalize it for not sound selfish (\"I just wanted a couple more minutes to myself, blah blah\") or that could be perceived as \"I was lying about missing you\" But he has to verbalize it if he doesn't want to be misinterpreted. You're not a mind reader.\n\nThose kind of feelings are normal. We can madly love and miss people, but need a little \"me time\" from all of them, selfish as it may sound.\n\nBut you also have every right to your feelings, to your \"me time\", and for no one to make you feel as if you have committed a mistake, when it is quite the opposite.

OP only had to wait 20 min and he would have been mentally prepared and likely decompressed from the car ride. Could he have handled it better? Absolutely, and he should apologize, but I don\u2019t think his reaction is left field. \n\nMy last 3 hour flight featured a middle aged man loudly hocking loogies every 15 min the ENTIRE flight; I very badly wanted to recommend an internist, ENT and pulmonologist to cure his mystery affliction.", "I think Somewhat YTA.I\u2019m surprised how many people want to make him the AH for being on a 4 day \u201cvacation\u201d from his kids and wife.

What if these trips are because one of his parents are dealing with a fatal medical diagnosis and he is trying to spend time with them before they die but they\u2019ve asked him not to tell his wife and kids they are dying? Or that maybe his parents are getting a divorce and wanted to tell him in person when he was doing his usual trip. There are so many reasons I can think of for this particular trip not to be relaxing nor a vacation and maybe he needed that 20-30 min trip to clear his head about all the grief over losing a parent and watching them waste away or struggling with how he will deal with his parents separating etc. I have two kids and if it were something like that I\u2019d struggle with them showing up at the airport unannounced not allowing me to decompress that info.

If he apologized, I'd drop it. \n\nIt has taken me way longer than I'd like to admit to think before I speak. Sounds like he could use some practice in that. We all make mistakes and say things we shouldn't. I'd suggest forgiveness. \n\nGood luck. Sorry that his reaction to the surprise hurt your feelings.", "In that moment he remembered he had a family", "NAH. You don't get to be the thought police, but you were trying to do a nice thing. He didn't do anything bad, he just didn't react how you wanted him to. You already knew he doesn't like unexpected changed to plans, so you can't then get angry at him for... not liking unexpected changes to his plans.\n\nTBH, I would probably have had a similar reaction. Maybe we're both weird in the same way. But I hate being forced into suddenly being happy. He was planning on being able to get home on his own time, and happily greet you all at the door. Instead it was a public spectacle (which I personally would hate, no idea how he feels), while he was still generally a bit grumpy about traveling.", "I wonder where they live.  In the U.S. you can't wait at the gate anymore. \n\nNTA", "Wth is with his reaction?!  Seeing your kids after being away should come as a boost to morale.  That guy has issues.

Was he planning on stopping somewhere to shower and change so he wouldn't be as sweaty before coming home? \n\nI personally prefer to Uber home after a flight out of consideration to others as it's a pain to get to and from the airport...but would be pleasantly surprised if someone was there to pick me up. \n\nGetting mad that someone actually showed up is weird...as if he has a guilty conscience because he was cheating on OP while he was away or something. The fact that OP feels it's somehow her fault for meeting her husband at the airport sounds at best like massive gaslighting on the part of the husband, and from being held hostage by the children because the husband works to provide for the household. Unless husband can pull his head out of his ass and realize wives aren't content being Betty Draper anymore and needs to start treating OP like an equal partner, this relationship sounds like it's hitting more turbulence than husband did on his flight.", "NTA, but as a man let me say this so you at least have an understanding of a man\u2019s train of thought. He traveled in a plane and was mentally tired. In his mind he will have that drive home, alone to decompress and unwind so that he can mentally be ready when he is home. I could have moved closer to my job but decided the 45 minutes was a good drive to decompress. This way I leave my problems at work and clear my mind for my wife and kids. He is still the AH because he should have sucked it up. Hope this helps.", "NTA This sounds sketchy as hell. It\u2019s like he was going to lie about where he was going or who he was meeting after the flight, then come home to you.

You need to remember that you are an adult. You've been in baby world, communicating with baby brain way too much and you just seem very very stressed. \n\nI know it seems like a big deal. But, you should really not try and make this a big deal. You are NTA for meeting him. But you are the AH for getting fuming angry and being a jerk about it just bc he was exhausted and not emotionally ready to meet you at the airport. Seriously. Just chill out. \n\nYou need to try harder to let things go. Sometimes he is going to say or do something, express something that isn't what you want to hear. That doesn't mean he is being mean to you. It just means you don't have control over his reaction to things. It is OK for him to have his own experience and for him to have the space to express his genuine thoughts. \n\nYou need to learn to like him even when he isn't catering to you. And, you need to not throw a temper tantrum nor even make a big deal out of every little thing. \n\nLIFE IS HARD ENOUGH WITHOUT MANUFACTURING REASONS TO BE UPSET", "Do low steaks come from shorts cows?", "NTA\n\nTime to book a trip away yourself I think and let your husband look after the kids for a few days.", "NAH imo. \nYour husband probably expected to have 20 minutes of calm to recollect himself before coming home. Yes he had fun for 3 days, but he can still be tired. If he's anything like me, he'll need some calm and quiet after 3 days with family where he probably was the center of attention. Maybe he anticipated to spend half an hour in a coffe shop on his way home, but now he can't really get it. His feelings exist and are valid. And if he is anything like me once again, he will tell what his feelings are without filter.\nI think you should have told him you were coming to the airport, you shouldn't be mad his feelings don't match yours when you were probably in a very different mindset. Imagine if some of your friends dropped unannounced at your house on a morning you had wanted to sleep in, it's likely you won't be as happy as them, and you might even be annoyed depending on the timing. You were anticipating the reunion, he was anticipating a moment of calm.\nIn the end it seems you have a good relationship and are able to communicate well with each other, and this was a small mistake from the both of you : you for doing something you knew he wasn't confortable with without asking him, him for not having a better control on his emotions and realizing that you took care of the kids for 3 days while he had some grownup time. I can't blame you for you reaction to his reaction, you feelings are valid too, but I think you both need to take a step back and take the other's feeling into consideration. I feel like both of you could apologize to the other (not as in \"I'm sorry, let's forget about it\", more as \"I'm sorry, and I learned a lesson on how to make our relationship work\").\nAnd I hope you get some week-ends of free time the same way he does.", "YTA.

Of course OP is hurt! I'd be gutted.  As for the whole, he was tired, hot from is flight thing - let's be real.  It was a 3 hour flight.", "Confuses me, even if I've had a terrible flight, if I walk through that gate and see my children excited to see me, regardless of how I feel, you don't crush your children's happiness like that and treat your wife, who has to parent alone ,like shit.

It was the _last_ thing I wanted to do right then, so you know what I did? I got in an Uber, got to her house, said a quick hello to everyone with a big smile and said I needed a few minutes to clean up from the plane.

I get panic attacks until I\u2019m through security, for example, and then I\u2019m good to go whether the rest of the trip is one hour or forty.\n\nI haven\u2019t traveled alone since my kid was born five years ago, but I do assume it would be far more relaxing alone than traveling with a kid. Still, I know there are people who don\u2019t travel comfortably, ever, and it\u2019s fair for those people to require extra decompression.", "Yes, being on the plane! I personally don\u2019t do well on flights and when you\u2019re feeling cramped and without proper airflow, it feels like crap. So YES, a 3 hour flight could require some decompression for some people. I would like to be able to greet my family in a better mood rather than vomiting as soon as I got home which happened on my last flight.", "This might shock you but most parents would miss their children after four days of separation and be happy to see them half an hour early.", "Per OPs post history they apparently have a dead bedroom, so...\n\ndude's being sketch", "I'm just saying that surprising someone who doesn't like surprises isn't actually doing something for their benefit- it's for the person planning the surprise.", "To me, not liking surprises wouldn't be in the same category as not wanting to see my family in a low effort environment. \n\nThat's why OP said that while she knows he doesn't like surprises she didn't think such a low stakes surprise would upset him. \n\nAlso, this is precisely why I compared the surprise to having your favourite dinner prepared as a surprise. It is low stakes and requires no effort from the receiver's part, whereas a surprise birthday party requires effort and energy from the receiver's part. \n\nA last point, OP mentions in the post he tells her to think hard before saying something because words can't be taken back, but apparently the same doesn't apply to him. And I guess this wouldn't have made Reddit if he had acknowledged he had an unpleasant reaction to a small inconvenience.", "Who cares if he likes surprises? His 3 year old missed him and wanted to see him at the airport. When you become a parent your kid's feelings are more important than yours. And seeing your family 20 minutes early is the lowest stakes surprise I can think of. Does he throw a fit at every 20 minute interruption to his day?\n\nAre you flying the plane yourself? Hanging from the wing for dear life? Doing pushups in the aisle? If you're doing anything other than sitting on your ass you're doing it wrong.", "So exhausting being on a plane after a vacation, definitely more exhausting than actually parenting while your spouse is on vacation.", "Anyone who is *that* exhausted after a 3 hour flight needs to learn some basic coping skills\u2026", "Oh yes yes. A 3-hour flight is absolutely more tiring than taking care of your kids ALL BY YOURSELF for 4 whole days.", "First he left her alone with 1y o and 3y o for 4days to have fun. Second when he gets home from vacation after 4 days of relaxing he needs to start parenting and caring for his freaking kids he also contributed making he doesn't get to relax at home too and let his wife continue alone to care for them. You are both Ah s.\n\nNTA op", "Do you have kids?", "\"Full time mom\" 1st paragraph.", "yeah a bus\u2026 with no windows, no ventilation, screaming kids, and a bunch of sweaty adults.", "Almost as fun as taking care of a one and three year old by yourself for FOUR DAYS. Instead of \"Thank you for giving me time off from parenting\"  she gets \"I can't even drive my 3yo home\". NTA", "3 hours ain\u2019t shit for a flight. That\u2019s like San Diego to San Francisco", "So the flight sucked.  That shouldn't make someone disappointed to see their family at the end of it.\n\nTry parenting 3 days solo with 2 toddlers.  I can tell you from experience that it's rough.  Yet he's the one complaining.", "It\u2019s annoying that he said that. But, not such a big deal. Some people don\u2019t deal well with surprises. You asked him directly, he answered honestly at that moment. Sure, he had the easy part of this, you had the hard part. You meant well. But, don\u2019t make too much of this off the cuff honest response. Let it go. Do talk about having a balance of both of you getting a break and personal travel time if you need to. But just saying this in response to a direct question isn\u2019t such a big deal.", "[deleted]", "If this is how he is after a 3 hour flight by himself after being on vacation then how does he handle doing the same flight 2x a year with OP and the toddlers?", "Exactly, OP doesn\u2019t even get to charge her batteries and his werent topped up enough- too bad for sad dad, he\u2019s a baby!\n\n\nNTA! But why are we building a life with someone so is shamelessly devoted to escaping it?", "After dealing with being stuck on an airplane with no AC for hours you can\u2019t understand why he would need to recharge some before being social?", "Look, we don't really know if his vacation was actually a resting one. For all we know, it could have been full on and extremely tiring, then to be a catching a flight, uncomfortable and buggered as hell without air-conditioning... I might feel moody too and just not have the energy to deal with a little more. OPs gesture was absolutely lovely but as previous poster mentioned, it isn't about her. Just wrong timing imo. Sure he could have sucked it up Nd out on a happy face. But sometimes emotions, moods and feelings get the best of people, not every single time can we control it and we just need some space for a breather and recuperate. It's worked both ways, she's shown her distate she was angry at him ?? She didn't swallow her emotions she let him know and he tried to clarify. But no one's the AH here.", "Fair enough - but this is something they agreed on - for him to go and visit on his own. From what I can understand - her writing intimates that he has quite a busy family - and it may be go go go with nephews to herd etc etc. I do feel for her - she was excited to take her little ones to meet Daddy. I love my family - but I get really spun out after flying - and the drive home lets me breathe a little before getting home - the buzzing in my head subsides, and I can start again with fresh energy. Just my personal take on it. No one is wrong here", "OP already knew that he doesn't respond well to surprises. And despite what you might think, people can have a great time and still feel drained when they get home. But that doesn't make it how he reacted to the situation. So in this instance both of them have room to grow, as we all do. Communicate with him OP. Tell him how you felt when he acted the way he did. Good luck to you both!", "For all we know, he had an argument with his family, or his parents behaved badly and stressed him out, or he had a terrible spare bed and couldn't sleep.   We don't know that he had a fun , relaxing visit.   His behavior leads me to think maybe not.", "Women can be misogynistic too.", "Yeah it's not like he's going through customs or immigration. Sounds like he isn't ready for a family tbh. Ditching them multiple times a year and only wanting to see them when he's not \"hot and sweaty\" from traveling? \n\nI wonder how he handled childbirth. \"I really don't wanna be here while you're all gross and sweaty pushing a human out of your body.\"", "I mean, on *my* last trip to visit my parents, the first leg of my flight home was two hours on a seat cushion that had my tailbone in excruciating pain. I was struggling to be civil on my way off the plane and had to buy one of those neck-donut pillows just to sit on for the rest of the trip.\n\nI then spent two hours at my home airport because my roommate got lost on the way to pick me up. Wound up walking several miles trying to find him and had a sobbing meltdown in the parking garage.\n\nSometimes stuff happens.", "That depends. Im extremely pressure sensitive, so take off and landing are REALLY rough on me. Last time i flew, it was only a 3 hour flight and i was very minorly congested. I took a nap, and upon descent I woke up to being completely unable to hear, my eardrums hurting and a migraine. No amount of popping my ears or chewing gum helped, and I was in hysterics because my anxiety immediately peaked when I woke up damn near deaf. It took 10-15 minutes once we were on ground for everything to get back to normal but damn. \n\nYeah, he probably didnt have that experience, but still. Theres plenty of points along the way that flying can be absolutely exhausting, even if the flight itself is short.", "A 3-hour flight with no A/C!!!", "whelp, when you have a wife and two kids you don't always get to decide what mood you greet them in.  You wake up everyday and have to be those things.  OP has been waking up everyday and spending 24 hours a day NOT decompressing from a relaxing vacation.", "Or maybe it's for the benefit of the child who missed their father and asked to go to the airport...", "Yea, his wife knew he didn't like surprises. \n\nLike I said, if you've never been on a plane, you don't realize how stressful it can be.", "Are you dumb? People handle travel differently. 3 hours stuck in a seat, cramped, having to deal with lines and shit and with no AC, most people wouldn\u2019t be happy after all that. And the fact that she knows he doesn\u2019t like surprises. Like??", "On a flight with no AC?? That shit would piss me off too", "he took the kid home without complaint and told his wife in private that he was upset. OP is leaving shit out of her post. She mentioned it in a few comments", "he DID drive the 3 yo home. OP mentioned it in a comment, and he didn\u2019t say any of it in front of the kids. OP conveniently left that part out", "are you being intentionally dense?? thats not what i\u2019m saying. its not a normal flight because of the conditions listed.", "i can also tell you from experience that it\u2019s rough. and he didn\u2019t complain in front of the children AND he drove the 3 yo home. OP didn\u2019t include it in the post despite that being the main selling point for everyone", "He's a fucking father who has had a vacation WITHOUT kids.

THREE hours.  I lived for 19 years in the tropics without AC. Give me a fucking break.", "It wasn\u2019t about her, but that\u2019s not great either. Why can\u2019t it be about her but in a positive way? Like, why in that moment couldn\u2019t he have considered her feelings about the situation? Thats something reasonable to expect.", "yeah, I honestly find that hard to believe. an airplane has to have a functioning air conditioning system to be able to take off, or am I crazy?", "But\u2026the decision was made for him. He could have walked through his front door with open arms and ready to love on his family. Maybe that was the scenario he had expected. Is he wrong for picturing a different homecoming?", "And his wife was supposed to put his feelings above those of her child? \n\nWhy would you assume I've never been on a plane? I've been on 4 in the last month, toddler in tow, a 3 hour flight really isn't that bad.", "Dude got 3 days to relax, kid free, with his family and he's complaining because OP didn't give him EVEN MORE alone time? Yeah, I'm dumb \ud83d\ude44", "Upset about what?! I saw it before I wrote. It doesn't change anything I said. \n\nHe doesn't have anything to complain about and nothing to be upset about either.\n\nShe brought the kids to see him at the airport instead of 20 minutes later home . He decided to have kids and he was alone on a freaking vacation for 4 days having fun.\n\nThe flight was without hassle (aka not between continents ) and only 3 hours where he sat in his freaking seat doing nothing. WTF?!", "That's awesome!", "Ok OP\u2019s husband", "This guy behaved like a jerk. Why are you defending him so hard?", "Thank you oh great arbiter of what we're allowed to be annoyed by.\n\nI stubbed my toe yesterday, almost got annoyed then remembered you probably had your leg eaten off by a shark, so I had no right to my own feelings.", "It's hard when you're caught off guard, when you're not expecting something, youre completely moody and in the moment u really just want to get home.", "no, he's not wrong for picturing anything.  We all picture our lives everyday and we're all mostly wrong. You can't get mad every time something doesn't go exactly as you imagined it. Especially when you decide to marry someone and have children with them. That just is how it is.  His very young children missed their father and were excited to see him.  He can picture any homecoming he wants. That doesn't mean he is entitled to that image in his mind.", "Wasn't that bad for you or other people? \n\nAlso, what exactly is wrong with OP's husband just wanting to get out of the airport and go home? \n\nBtw, a 3 hour flight is only as bad as the people on the plane. You, flying 4 times in the last month would know that.", "Glad you agree lmfaoooooo she knows he doesn\u2019t like surprises and still did it anyways. And like I said people handle travel differently. 3 hrs on a plane with no AC would piss majority of people off", "i just think it\u2019s ridiculous because if a man was complaining about taking care of his kids for a few days without help they\u2019d tell him to shove it", "But, he wasn\u2019t mad. He was just honest when he said he didn\u2019t want her to meet him at the airport. She got mad. He probably just wanted to quickly get out of there and go home. Airports are a pain.", "Nothing wrong with wanting it, just being a dick to his wife when she and their kids were excited to see him. He 1000% got the better deal this weekend. He should be grateful, not whining about wanting to spend even more time away from his family.", "This may come as a shock, but sometimes, especially when you have young children, everything isn't about what you want.", "travel and airports suck. But dude had literally been calling home saying he missed them so much. \n\nWhen someone you love surprises you at the airport after a stay away, your first feeling should not be \"ugh, back to this shit again.\"\n\nthat is upsetting. This should not be surprising or controversial.", "It's only 20 more minutes they would've waited at the house though. It's not exactly whining when you just want to get out of the airport to get home.", "This may come as a shock to you, but a grown ass adult should be able to either communicate with her partner and give him a heads up so he\u2019s prepared, plan it ahead for next time or just tell the kid no, maybe next time like??  Not hard at all. Now she\u2019s here acting like a child bc he was honest about not liking the surprise like??? Lmfao the mental gymnastics"]}
