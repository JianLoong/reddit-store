A little difficult with 2 small kids but, I'm a full time mom so I can do it and I don't mind because I know he has so much fun.\n\nMy husband left early (4am) on Thursday to go visit his family. I took care of our 1yo and 3yo by myself until he got back into town on Sunday afternoon. \n\nMy 3yo had been missing daddy and wanted to go see him \"at his airport\". So after nap time on Sunday, I packed the kids in the car, drove the 20 minutes to the airport and waited at the gate as a surprise for him! (He drove our other car and parked at the airport.)\n\nHe had also been texting me and video chat the whole time telling me how much fun he was having with his parents and brother, but that he missed me and the kids way more than he thought he would. \n\nHe was surprised alright. Got a really cute video of kids running at their dad.\n\nBut his reaction was also less than enthusiastic. I asked him if it was a good surprise. He said \" it was a surprising surprise\". Then we get into the car so I can drive him over to the economy lot where he is parked and 3yo wanted to ride home with dad. He says \"I really didn't want you to be here\". Like wtf am I supposed to say to that? And he just says he'll explain more later. \n\nWell I'm fuming the whole car ride home without him and when we get back to the house I am quite l, fearing I'm going to say to say something I regret in anger if I speak. He can tell.\n\nHe just says \"I can't come home to this, just talk to me\". I tell him to explain what he meant by his earlier comment of not wanting us there and he said he was just tired and sweaty from being in a cramped airplane for three hours and was just ready for the travel experience to be done with. \n\nI'm still angry. \n\nI say \" well was it a good surprise? Because you said it was just a surprising surprise\". He pauses and says \"it was good, I just didn't expect it\". I roll my eyes... *that's what suprise is* \n\nI ask him to take back what he said at the airport, and he did. But like it still hurt. \n\nMaybe I could have handled it better. I guess I do know he doesn't like surprises so maybe I'm an asshole for trying to set up a good one with what I thought were pretty low steaks. Maybe I'm the Ahole for not taking into consideration his mental state after just spending 3 hours on a plane (that the AC was broken on). Maybe I'm not the Ahole and he always tells me to watch what I say because sometimes it can't be taken back and this time it was him. \n\nIdk.

You're right that your kids being at the airport is low stakes. It's not a surprise birthday party, it's your family. \n\nEdit: AND he's just been away for a fun trip, while you've been parenting your kids alone - I'm not sure that he gets to be grumpy in this situation.", "I don\u2019t get these responses.  Of course you are upset.  You have looked after the kids while he gets a trip, one of two per year, and his response is he didn\u2019t want to see you at the airport?  Because he\u2019s hot and doesn\u2019t like surprises?  Boo hoo.  It was a shitty thing to say and I think you should send him with the kids next time or let him come home to an empty house while you and kids do something fun.  No more favourite dinners upon his return.", "NTA \n\nYou were being sweet. Your little one wanted to see dad! And your husband was telling you how much he missed the kids\u2026 \n\nYou have every right to be pissed. Im sure you\u2019ve had to jump right into parenting during times when you\u2019re tired, and stressed, and sweaty. And I\u2019d bet you don\u2019t make your discontent visible to the kids. And he wasn\u2019t even being asked to jump into the work of parenting, the excited hugs and \u201cI love you\u201d *is the fun part*. I really hope I\u2019m misunderstanding and he didn\u2019t say that he really didn\u2019t want you there in front of the kids. If I am understanding correctly then he was *completely* out of line.", "NTA - a 3 hour flight is really not all that long. Can't even watch 2 modern movies during that time. Its a weird thing to say that he didn't want you to be there after telling you he misses you and the kids.", "NTA. \n\nIt should not even be a surprise, a father can expect his children at an certain age to want to go to the airport to pick him up. It's a small adventure and it makes the waiting so much easier on them. And a father should be thrilled to see his kids running up to him after 4 days. Not annoyed. \n\nI've had shitty flights, coming home really tired, dreading the ride home. Seeing my wife and kids there was such a happy moment for me.\n\nAnd jfc, it was only a 3 hours flight. Come on...\n\nThe \"i really didn't want you to be here\" makes me wonder what's going on. It's highly disrespectfull to you.  It's also oddly specific. It's almost if something had to happen at the airport before he was ready to go home and see his family again.\n\nJust took a look at a previous post of you. Yes, there's more going on here.", "NTA OP! I don\u2019t understand the Y T A votes here. You did a very sweet, small thing. Yes, he does not really like surprises but this was not an elaborate birthday party with 150 people and a big band. You took his children, that he missed (and that missed him) to see him when he got off a plane. The man was slightly uncomfortable for three hours (boo fcking hoo) and therefore could not bring himself to be happy to see his wife and children? Even if he did not like the surprise very much, it is really hurtful for him to say that he did not want you there. Of course you are upset, this feels like a huge rejection.\n\nEdit: people are saying he wanted to destress on the way home in the car and that you should have understood that. The man was on a FUN trip with his family, without his kids. This should have been relaxing enough don\u2019t you think?", "Info: How does he pick you up from your twice yearly solo vacations? Do the kids ever want to go with him when he picks you up?  \n\n\nOr is this just a special treat for him and you can just be happy to serve with a smile?", "So I think your husband\u2019s behavior was rude and hurtful, but I suspect that I think more the way you do than than your husband. I think you\u2019re NTA, but the perspectives from the surprise hating grumpy travelers have certainly been enlightening. It would never have occurred to me either to be able to understand that point of view without all the feedback I\u2019ve seen on your post.", "NTA \n\nBut travel can be stressful, telling him you were coming could've prepared him for this. Some people are fussy travelers, or want their alone time getting coffee after they land or whatever, he probably was just surprised to see you there. Not everyone likes surprises, some people want predictability and structure.", ">*low steaks*\n\nLol\n\nNTA overall\u2014 but I can appreciate your husband\u2019s point of view. I fly a decent amount and I hate it every time. I\u2019m not anxious about flying itself, but all of the accompanying *travel* bullshit; waiting in lines, sitting around, sitting next to gross strangers in a stuffy metal tube, arranging accommodations, rentals, checking/picking up baggage, etc. I generally get a bit cranky at the end of a days\u2019 flights. I feel spent, like I can\u2019t handle too many more things that demand my attention. Usually I just want to get home and decompress for a bit.\n\nSo what your husband said makes sense to me.", "NTA at all. Oh, a little kid wanted to meet their dad the airport, the horror! Your husband should just have been nice about that and \u0175ent home together. It's not like he was asked to take a crying child to the dentist right after his flight. Just a hug, a kiss and that's all. It's such a small and easy thing that I don't get what's his deal at all.", "NTA. I hate surprises, traveled a lot with work and know what it takes to pack up and get young kids ready to go anywhere. I would have been absolutely overjoyed if you did that for me. That someone would think of that, love someone enough to bother, I would have been reenergised and ecstatic to see the kids running towards me with you proudly looking on. Good on you, I\u2019m sorry he didn\u2019t appreciate your thoughtful gesture. I do if it\u2019s any consolation.", "Your NTA, but you expected him to act and feel a certain way then got angry because he isn't living up to your expectations. He was tired and cranky and probably wanted some down time, you wanted a happy loving reunion. Neither is wrong.", "Maybe your husband does not have the enough emotional capacity for a surprise so instead of the stereotypical \"Happy\" reaction that we anticipated, he might have felt \"worried\" or \"mildly irritated\" for he doesn't know how to react to a surprise. You might have brought him mental confusion and exhaustion.", "NTA\n\nAlso, there's no way the AC wasn't working on the airplane. At the altitude that passenger jets fly at, that's not just AC, it's *life support.* The only time it would normally be turned off is during take off and landing, in order to guarantee all available energy is diverted to the engines in case of emergency.", "NTA. How could you reasonably have offended him? His children wanted to see him at the airport and you brought them. I don't even understand his objection. Who cares if he was tired, no one was asking anything of him except a hug.", "As someone who travels and a dad who is a pilot, it\u2019s a process to prepare being back in a routine and from exhausting travel plans. I don\u2019t think he meant it rudely but he was probably mentally preparing for his upcoming week and as you said he doesn\u2019t like surprises. And traveling on a packed plane with no AC is not a joke. It\u2019s horrific. He wasn\u2019t trying to insult you or hurt your feelings. \n\nHowever you have a right to be upset. You wanted to do something cute and nice and your child was asking for dad but he didn\u2019t respond in the way you wanted. I just hope you\u2019re not more upset because the video wasn\u2019t as good with his expression. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is the AH but just a difference of agreement. You both could of handled it differently but I totally get where both sides are coming from.", "He doesn't like surprises.\n\nAs a person who also does not like surprises, I understand how he felt when a sudden change of what he thought his last trek of the exhausting travel home would look like. \n\nSome people are just like that. \nWe need things to be unsurprising. \n\nIt's not that he wasn't looking forward to seeing you guys, but he was tired, he was planning to mentally charge up on the drive home before he had to interact with people. \n\nNAH", "NTA - were you expected to tell a 3yo that they can\u2019t go see Daddy at the airport after he\u2019s been a way for 3 days and nights (long time for littles) because Daddy doesn\u2019t like surprises? And don\u2019t most 3-6 yo\u2019s love the airport, watching planes take off and land? Your husband is TA for having a great weekend with his birth family and then having no patience for the family he created, with you. Forgive him but he should be more grateful for all he has with you three.", "NTA I dont think you did anything wrong OP. What you did is not out of the ordinary nor is it extremely demanding for your husband. It was honestly very normal and not over the top at all? I really dont get his comment. I fly often and I understand that flights can be hard but what kind of reaction is this? And then hes telling you \"I cant come home to this\" when he was the one that caused it??? This wasnt a surprise birthday party, you just brought his children to see him. I think your reaction was justified, OP.", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s comment, \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to be here\u201d was way too harsh. Sounds like he didn\u2019t mean it though, as he took it back, but it\u2019s not a good thing to say in the first place. You\u2019ve been watching the kids while he\u2019s having fun, and you just wanted to greet him at the airport with the kids.\n\nI think what could benefit both of you is open discussion of what\u2019s not acceptable as a surprise, or any adjustments/accommodations either of you may need while traveling. Since you mention that your husband is also telling you to watch what you say, a discussion of how to approach disagreements could be good too, so you\u2019re both trying to create a win-win situation through proper communication and not tearing each other down.", "NTA. I get being hot, cranky and tired but surely the sight of your kids running towards you with a smile on their face\u2026 brings a smile to yours. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t normally say that one wants to wallow in the grumpiness, but it feels that way when he clearly says he didn\u2019t want to OP there.", "NAH you tried to do something sweet, and he really didn\u2019t want a lot of activity as he was tired and sweaty. You kind of knew he didn\u2019t like surprises but I\u2019m sure this seemed  different. I hope you can talk about it and let it go.", "NTA in no way shape or form. Excuse me? He thinks 3 hours is too much to bear? Try 24+ hour flights to visit relatives in Europe or North America from Australia. He had fun right? So wtf did he need to do/get up to at/from the airport that was so much more important than his wife or kids and that he possibly didn\u2019t want you to see or know about? I would get really sus if I were you.\n\nAt best he\u2019s a first class whinge bat.", "NTA but I can't stand being ambushed so see why he's pissed off too.", "I *hate* surprises. Always have, always will. \n\nBut if I was met at the airport with my kids after being away from them for a few days, I would be so happy. NTA at all.", "I live in a different country than my parents and siblings. I don't see them very often. When I return home after a visit I always feel quite sad and devastated at leaving them. It takes me a while to get back into my usual rythm. \n\nMaybe that is how this chap felt, too, and he thought he had the drive home to get back into the right head space.....", "NAH\n\nBut you need to please learn to trust your husband when he explains the meaning behind his words and to not take such remarks personally.\n\nIf he is tired and crappy from traveling, he will not be able to allocate enough energy to manage your feelings. You need to be in control of how you react to what he does or says. \n\nWhen you feel that something is bothering you and you don't have the option to clarify right away, tell yourself \"this is not about me\" and wait to be able to ask what he was thinking when the bothersome thing happened. But ask with the same tone as if you were at the dinner table asking him to pass the salt. If the explanation makes sense, believe him. If it doesn't make sense, tell him you're confused and ask him to help you make sense of it.\n\nTrusting that your husband is not purposefully trying to hurt you with his mistakes is crucial.", "Are we sure the side piece didn\u2019t have to jump into a bin?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't get me wrong, the suprise is cute- but that trip home from the airport could have been one-on-one time to discuss matters (without kids) or a chance to process things in his head.

That was unfortunate, but you getting mad and letting him see it was also unfortunate.\n\nI have sympathy for him because I remember needing winding-down time after a long drive before getting pounced on by the whole loud family.  And I remember having to learn how to communicate to everyone what I needed, and find ways to get it that didn't hurt people's feelings.  I think you should apologize to him.  I think you should start teaching your kids that part of respecting people's individual needs is that daddy needs quiet time after his trips.

That's EXACTLY what you have been doing for years with his travels. For days on this one. To think about how he felt, and during that time, being you the one taking care of everything.\n\nI think now it's up to him to give you a little credit, and understand that his children wanted to see him, that you wanted to see him too, and that his words implied that your presence would be welcomed.\n\nThat has not been? Ok. There can be many causes behind it. But he only has two options: hold back those feelings in orther to don't make you upset for it, if he doesn't want to explain himself after, and get carried away a little by the children's excitement, or clearly explain to you what has overwhelmed him to the point of making you feel unwelcome.\n\nIt's probably something so small that he's even embarrassed to verbalize it for not sound selfish (\"I just wanted a couple more minutes to myself, blah blah\") or that could be perceived as \"I was lying about missing you\" But he has to verbalize it if he doesn't want to be misinterpreted. You're not a mind reader.\n\nThose kind of feelings are normal. We can madly love and miss people, but need a little \"me time\" from all of them, selfish as it may sound.\n\nBut you also have every right to your feelings, to your \"me time\", and for no one to make you feel as if you have committed a mistake, when it is quite the opposite.

OP only had to wait 20 min and he would have been mentally prepared and likely decompressed from the car ride. Could he have handled it better? Absolutely, and he should apologize, but I don\u2019t think his reaction is left field. \n\nMy last 3 hour flight featured a middle aged man loudly hocking loogies every 15 min the ENTIRE flight; I very badly wanted to recommend an internist, ENT and pulmonologist to cure his mystery affliction.", "I think Somewhat YTA.I\u2019m surprised how many people want to make him the AH for being on a 4 day \u201cvacation\u201d from his kids and wife.

What if these trips are because one of his parents are dealing with a fatal medical diagnosis and he is trying to spend time with them before they die but they\u2019ve asked him not to tell his wife and kids they are dying? Or that maybe his parents are getting a divorce and wanted to tell him in person when he was doing his usual trip. There are so many reasons I can think of for this particular trip not to be relaxing nor a vacation and maybe he needed that 20-30 min trip to clear his head about all the grief over losing a parent and watching them waste away or struggling with how he will deal with his parents separating etc. I have two kids and if it were something like that I\u2019d struggle with them showing up at the airport unannounced not allowing me to decompress that info.

If he apologized, I'd drop it. \n\nIt has taken me way longer than I'd like to admit to think before I speak. Sounds like he could use some practice in that. We all make mistakes and say things we shouldn't. I'd suggest forgiveness. \n\nGood luck. Sorry that his reaction to the surprise hurt your feelings.", "In that moment he remembered he had a family", "NAH. You don't get to be the thought police, but you were trying to do a nice thing. He didn't do anything bad, he just didn't react how you wanted him to. You already knew he doesn't like unexpected changed to plans, so you can't then get angry at him for... not liking unexpected changes to his plans.\n\nTBH, I would probably have had a similar reaction. Maybe we're both weird in the same way. But I hate being forced into suddenly being happy. He was planning on being able to get home on his own time, and happily greet you all at the door. Instead it was a public spectacle (which I personally would hate, no idea how he feels), while he was still generally a bit grumpy about traveling.", "I wonder where they live.  In the U.S. you can't wait at the gate anymore. \n\nNTA", "Wth is with his reaction?!  Seeing your kids after being away should come as a boost to morale.  That guy has issues.

Was he planning on stopping somewhere to shower and change so he wouldn't be as sweaty before coming home? \n\nI personally prefer to Uber home after a flight out of consideration to others as it's a pain to get to and from the airport...but would be pleasantly surprised if someone was there to pick me up. \n\nGetting mad that someone actually showed up is weird...as if he has a guilty conscience because he was cheating on OP while he was away or something. The fact that OP feels it's somehow her fault for meeting her husband at the airport sounds at best like massive gaslighting on the part of the husband, and from being held hostage by the children because the husband works to provide for the household. Unless husband can pull his head out of his ass and realize wives aren't content being Betty Draper anymore and needs to start treating OP like an equal partner, this relationship sounds like it's hitting more turbulence than husband did on his flight.", "NTA, but as a man let me say this so you at least have an understanding of a man\u2019s train of thought. He traveled in a plane and was mentally tired. In his mind he will have that drive home, alone to decompress and unwind so that he can mentally be ready when he is home. I could have moved closer to my job but decided the 45 minutes was a good drive to decompress. This way I leave my problems at work and clear my mind for my wife and kids. He is still the AH because he should have sucked it up. Hope this helps.", "NTA This sounds sketchy as hell. It\u2019s like he was going to lie about where he was going or who he was meeting after the flight, then come home to you.

You need to remember that you are an adult. You've been in baby world, communicating with baby brain way too much and you just seem very very stressed. \n\nI know it seems like a big deal. But, you should really not try and make this a big deal. You are NTA for meeting him. But you are the AH for getting fuming angry and being a jerk about it just bc he was exhausted and not emotionally ready to meet you at the airport. Seriously. Just chill out. \n\nYou need to try harder to let things go. Sometimes he is going to say or do something, express something that isn't what you want to hear. That doesn't mean he is being mean to you. It just means you don't have control over his reaction to things. It is OK for him to have his own experience and for him to have the space to express his genuine thoughts. \n\nYou need to learn to like him even when he isn't catering to you. And, you need to not throw a temper tantrum nor even make a big deal out of every little thing. \n\nLIFE IS HARD ENOUGH WITHOUT MANUFACTURING REASONS TO BE UPSET", "Do low steaks come from shorts cows?", "NTA\n\nTime to book a trip away yourself I think and let your husband look after the kids for a few days.", "NAH imo. \nYour husband probably expected to have 20 minutes of calm to recollect himself before coming home. Yes he had fun for 3 days, but he can still be tired. If he's anything like me, he'll need some calm and quiet after 3 days with family where he probably was the center of attention. Maybe he anticipated to spend half an hour in a coffe shop on his way home, but now he can't really get it. His feelings exist and are valid. And if he is anything like me once again, he will tell what his feelings are without filter.\nI think you should have told him you were coming to the airport, you shouldn't be mad his feelings don't match yours when you were probably in a very different mindset. Imagine if some of your friends dropped unannounced at your house on a morning you had wanted to sleep in, it's likely you won't be as happy as them, and you might even be annoyed depending on the timing. You were anticipating the reunion, he was anticipating a moment of calm.\nIn the end it seems you have a good relationship and are able to communicate well with each other, and this was a small mistake from the both of you : you for doing something you knew he wasn't confortable with without asking him, him for not having a better control on his emotions and realizing that you took care of the kids for 3 days while he had some grownup time. I can't blame you for you reaction to his reaction, you feelings are valid too, but I think you both need to take a step back and take the other's feeling into consideration. I feel like both of you could apologize to the other (not as in \"I'm sorry, let's forget about it\", more as \"I'm sorry, and I learned a lesson on how to make our relationship work\").\nAnd I hope you get some week-ends of free time the same way he does.", "YTA.

Of course OP is hurt! I'd be gutted.  As for the whole, he was tired, hot from is flight thing - let's be real.  It was a 3 hour flight.", "Confuses me, even if I've had a terrible flight, if I walk through that gate and see my children excited to see me, regardless of how I feel, you don't crush your children's happiness like that and treat your wife, who has to parent alone ,like shit.

It was the _last_ thing I wanted to do right then, so you know what I did? I got in an Uber, got to her house, said a quick hello to everyone with a big smile and said I needed a few minutes to clean up from the plane. Took a quick shower, got my shit together, and spent the next 4 hours chatting with strangers and eating canap\u00e9s. Why?

I have a higher need for alone time and opprotunities to tune out or switch off.\nSo when me and my SO are cleaning or cooking, I prefer to listen to an audibook instead of being social with her. \nDoesn't mean I care less or cheating. \n\nThe point is, I think the husband just looked forward to 20 mins all to himself, before he rejoins his home and life with a wife and kids. Nothing wrong with that. \nAnd I also hate all of these \"he was on a fun trip, and she was being a parent\" oh well boohoo, then OP can go have a fun trip and everything is even.\n\nI recently went on a \"fun\" trip too to my family for almost two weeks, and I brought our 5yo son who is quite a handful. We had fun visiting family and I had to be a parent too. So when I came home I needed relief and rest, even though I had a fun trip, but it's not like I expect his mother to pack her bags and fly off with him for an equal amount of time so life is made fair again.", "Yes, some people shouldn\u2019t have them.", "You are right I misread that sentence in the post. I thought she was saying instead of 2 family trips she supports him in taking 2 solo trips.

Europe is notoriously badly connected between countries - so for effective 2,5 hours of flying - it took us an entire day of travelling. \n\nour first flight was delayed for over an hour. our connecting flight was at the airport which was in strike and had extreme shortage of ground staff - so we waited there for hours, just to board - and then wait over an hour more to take off... \n\nand our trip back was even worse as UK is no longer in EU - so we were stuck in an neverending line at security - where they decided they have different regulations for cabin bags than stated on airline website - so they made us repack all of our liquids from 2 half litre zip bags to one 1 litre zip bag (like, it's the same effing thing, but ok \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)...", "I really don't think the 3 year old would have even remembered not going to the airport, but if it was for the kid's benefit why not call or text the husband before?

It ended up not working, but you didn\u2019t have any bad intentions. You said that you know he doesn\u2019t like surprises, so maybe it would have been possible to guess his reaction, but it\u2019s not a big deal that you guessed incorrectly. Next time, maybe ask him beforehand if he would be ok with you and the children coming to meet him. It won\u2019t be a surprise then, but he might appreciate it more.   \n\n\nWhen he said that he really didn\u2019t want you to be there, what he did was provide feedback, so that you would be able to know better in the future what he likes and dislikes. You asked if it was a good surprise, indicating that you wanted such feedback. He didn\u2019t want to give negative feedback in front of the children, so he gave it quickly privately with the intention to talk about it more later.   \n\n\nThen you became angry, because you just wanted him to appreciate the surprise. He eventually sensed that you wouldn\u2019t accept negative feedback and just said it was good. As someone who would not like a surprise like this, I can completely understand your husband\u2019s actions. He was just set on being alone for another while after an awful flight and then he unexpectedly has to multitask being social and getting home. When he tells his wife this kind of surprise isn\u2019t something he likes, she gets angry. Your inability to accept that your husband didn\u2019t like the surprise is what makes YTA, in my opinion.   \n\n\nMy advice is to accept the husband you have, with his likes and dislikes. We can demand or encourage our partners to perform better, communicate better, be more responsible, etc. However, we shouldn\u2019t try to change what they like - it will just lead to them lying about it and that will often lead to resentment.", "For me it's a NAH .

He'd probably constructed an idea of how things were going to go for him to achieve that end and suddenly BOOM ha fuck you buddy that thing you had your mind set on isn't happening - the moment of control was taken from him. Essentially you re-made his plans for him without asking him. Some people don't like surprises because they're underneath it all just coping with the world and planning accordingly and that's fine. \n\n\n*However* you had good intentions and you weren't to know all of that, if it is the case.

I don't think this is entirely unreasonable, I would hate having to do that trip too, even if the visit was worth the travel. I wouldn't feel up to dealing with adults who understand that before a shower and a quick sit down in a comfortable, familiar space, let alone a 3 year old who can't be expected to understand the grumpiness.\n\nYou surprised him anyway, disregarding his dislike for surprises and his desire to decompress. This doesn't really clear the bar for being an asshole for me, as an isolated incident.\n\nWhat is asshole-y, to me, is being *that* angry at him not being enthusiastic in that situation. Why would you expect anything different?

Now, he absolutely could have communicated better, but at the same time, he's stressed, and you just put him further off-balance with the surprise. It shouldn't be surprising that he didn't communicate well. \n\nYeah, if he's always telling you to watch what you're saying because sometimes it can't be taken back, maybe he's a bit of a hypocrit.

If he genuinely tries to live by that, and you're generally happy with the relationship, and he isn't otherwise objectionable (and if those aren't true, I question the premise of the happy marriage in general), then I guarantee you that he's kicking himself for it.\n\nAll that said, honestly, unless there's an underlying issue (you suspect infidelity, his \"be careful what you say\" stuff is controlling rather than advisory, he's not contributing to the relationship or the childcare in a proportional way, etc), just sit down with him, apologise to each other, talk it through a bit so you understand each other better, and try to let it go.", "YTA.

And that wasn't surge pricing or anything. I had someone pick me up from the airport after that trip because like hell I was spending another $50 lol.", "It\u2019s not quite the same, but after a long day at the office, my commute is my time to zone out, put on some music and not feel any stress from that day.

And not one child but two?\n\nYes, how terrible for him his child wanted to see him cause he loved him. How terrible he had a fun trip all for himself while she didn't have a problem taking care of the children to let him unwind\n\nMy heart breaks for all the inconveniences life throws at him.

IF I felt that way (normally I don't; I want my creature comforts), I would have that talk after the intensity of the feeling had passed. Airports are stressful already, so whatever decompression time he was expecting there is confusing to me. Especially if there was a delay, baggage to get, anything requiring any additional spoons beyond \"walk outside, ride is already here\".\n\nI do get the need for that time, because I also need it. I just won't hurt my daughter's feelings to get it. And it would not happen successfully anywhere near the proximity of the cause of said stress.", "Divorce! Sue!

I know that outrage feels good and all, but come on, get ahold of yourself.", ">Old mate just had 4 days to himself!\n\nNo, he didn't. He had four days visiting his family. For a lot of people, spending several days with family is very stressful and can definitely be overwhelming. \n\n>guess who picks em up from the airport? Their SOs! \n\n>The guys that don't get their missos to grab em usually detour by the brothels on their way home.\n\nOkay, I work away from home a lot too, and my partner never picks me up at the airport, because he doesn't drive and it's quicker and more convenient to get a taxi even if he did. I literally got home at 3:30 this morning from a trip and would have been furious to have someone in my way \"surprising\" me when I'm trying to just get quietly home and a few minutes to decompress from the stress of travelling. He works away occasionally too and I have offered to pick him up, but he also prefers not, so I wouldn't push it on him.\n\nYou really have an extremely low opinion of men, and it's kinda sad.", ">dude just had a four day vacation having a blast\n\nDid he? Four days visiting family isn't usually relaxing or \"a blast' and can also be super stressful. I don't know that anything in the post confirms he was living it up for these four days. \n\n>he couldn't muster up a little more enthusiasm to see them? I mean, he didn't even have to be that enthusiastic if he was tired, but to literally say I don't want you here?\n\nI feel like he sort of snapped because of the situation. I hate surprises too and wouldn't want anyone there either. I'd try not to say it but he's tired and stressed, things slip out. \n\nAlso, (and I say this as a very frequent flyer, averaging 100+ flights per year) any flight can be stressful. Long haul sometimes is stressful, but short haul can be too. Maybe he was sat next to someone loud or obnoxious, maybe the flight was delayed, maybe the staff were rude or unhelpful, all kinds of things can add together even on a short flight to be stressful or annoying - and sometimes a long haul flight goes super smoothly. I don't think the length of the flight dictates how stressful it is.", ">4 days for himself\n\nWhy do so many people thinking visiting family is so relaxing? Family time is stressful and overwhelming for so so many people, especially for several days at a time. It's not like he was at a spa or sat on a beach with his feet up for four days.", "So she's just looking for an excuse to cheat on him then and she's making a mountain out of a molehill as a result.", "That\u2019s so gross. I don\u2019t know how she can say she isn\u2019t cheating with a straight face when she\u2019s exchanging explicit sexual fantasies with multiple old flames?? I hate knowing that people are like this. The only worse thing than acting surprised when something \u201cjust happens\u201d now is being *honestly* surprised by it.

In Australia you can go to a Domestic gate without a boarding pass.", "That's precisely my take. I'm one of those people that don't deal well with surprises, but that's only ones that require a set time commitment where I already had plans. But this is way more lax than my case because OP's surprise is more like cohesive with the husband's itinerary. It's kind of odd, sure, but it boils down to OP forcing something (no matter how much he likes it) unexpectedly onto the husband. \n\nIt's more NAH to me", "Yeah I use try to not think that way but unfortunately infidelity is very common and that was the first thing that popped into my head.

The reason he was grumpy was because he actually had three jobs on three continents.  \n\nMy excuse has the same facts as people speculating he took a secret lover to visit the family, like they wouldn't know that's not his wife.   \"vacation fatigue\" is absolutely a thing when you try to get in as much as possible and are exhausted at the end.", "i agree lol, these commenters are the assholes. daydreaming about nefarious reasons with nothing to go from.", "Some of us had spouses who behaved like this and\u2026 were cheaters. \n\nThanks for assuming we\u2019re freaks.", "It\u2019s also insane to assume the average person behaves like an oilfield worker, people notorious for unethical sleazy behavior.", "Yes, even with him being close to his family, there are a lot of ways that a family visit can be stressful.
