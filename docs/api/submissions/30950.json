All the wedding planning had been going smoothly until last week, when my fianc\u00e9 tells me she wants to wear matching wedding dresses. She already has hers chosen, while i'm still looking. I've seen her wedding dress and i think it's very beautiful, it just isn't my style. \n\nI told her I wasn't sure and she asked what I meant. I laughed and said \"Well I don't really know if I wanna match.\" She looked upset and asked why I didn't wanna match with her. I told her I loved her dress it just wasn't my style. Her dress was poofy and big, while I preferred more simple and straight dresses. She just said okay and walked off. A few days past, it's Saturday. I go to the dress shop we were getting our dresses from after work and when I walked in the owner of the shop looks confused. She asks \"Well what are you doing here?\". I smile and say well i'm still looking at dresses, remember. Then she looks even more confused.\n\nShe tells me my fianc\u00e9 already ordered a dress to me online. I ask which dress and she shows me  the exact same dress my wife has, and unfortunately, there are no refunds. I apologize to the owner for the inconvenience and go home, waiting for my fianc\u00e9 to get back from work. She gets home after a while and I ask her why did she order that dress without my permission, she acts like she doesn't know what i'm talking about, until I show her the order.\n\nShe starts to cry and says she just wanted me to match with her. I told her that I already said I didn't wanna match with her and she told me she thought I would change my mind. I told her that even if she was 100% sure I was gonna change my mind she shouldn't of ordered the dress without asking me first. \n\nShe cries even more, accuses me of not loving her, and calls me selfish and I call her pushy and bratty. She then gets up, calls me an a-hole, and begins packing her stuff. I ask where she's going and she tells me she's going to stay at her moms for a few days. \n\nI tell her she's being dramatic and she's in the wrong for ordering the dress without my permission first. It's been 3 days Still at her mom's. I've sent her many texts and voicemails, and called her. She hasn't responded. I texted her mom and she told me i was an a-hole for yelling at her.\n\nThese few days I have been feeling really bad and starting to think I may be the A-hole. Also, be before says anything, i am not i instrested in leaving her. I love her more than anyone and i am not willing to throw away a 9 year relationship over a dress. \n\nYour thoughts?

You should look into pre-marital counseling. This won't be the last thing you disagree on that means a lot to both of you. You may as well learn how to navigate this stuff together without running off to your parents' places.", "NTA  \nThis wedding is just as much yours as it is hers, and you deserve to wear something you feel comfortable in. I think it's really childish of her to play the victim and run off to her moms, when you were trying to point out how messed up this is.   \n\n\nStop contacting her and her mom, stop entertaining this tantrum. She's turning this on you when she's the one who messed up. Just leave her be and let her come to her senses, stand your ground, and talk it out when she's ready and comes back.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d question deeply any relationship in which saying \u201cno\u201d is met with \u201cyou don\u2019t love me\u201d.", "NTA - Look, there is no way to soft-soap this so it's best to be blunt. This is controlling behaviour by your fiancee and a massive red flag. I understand and respect you not wanting to throw away a 9-year relationship but you will be doing yourself no favours if you don't take a step back and think about the implications of your fiancee's actions. Let's take it in order. Now, there is no harm in her asking you to match, I understand some people would find that sweet, but when you said no, that should have been the instant end of the suggestion. Now, here's where it starts to get worrying. From what you are saying your fiancee ordered the dress AFTER you said no. She completely disregarded your views and tried to force you to do what she wanted. That indicates that not only will she do whatever she can to get her own way, but all she cares about is that SHE gets HER perfect wedding, she obviously has no care that you don't get the wedding YOU want.\n\nBut then it gets even worse. She accuses you of not loving her, that YOU are the one being selfish. In her view, she is the one who deserves to get what she wants, you don't matter. This  is classic gaslighting, then she flounces out, turns on the waterworks to her mum and is now trying to manipulate you into believing you are in the wrong for wanting to wear a dress you love at your own wedding. And I'm guessing the tantrum will continue until you give in and she gets her own way. I'm also betting it's not the first time she's thrown a tantrum to get her own way.\n\nNow, you say you're not breaking up with her, that's up to you, you're an adult and if you are willing to put up with this kind of behaviour, that's your decision. I wouldn't. Any partner who treated me like a supporting player in my own life wouldn't see me for dust, but you are also right that your whole relationship is not just the wedding.\n\nBut what I would advise you is that you need to have a long hard think to yourself about whether you are prepared to put up with behaviour like this, because if she gets her way here, this will happen each and every time you disagree on something. You need to establish hard boundaries, make it clear to her that you will not be manipulated and that your relationship will not last if she thinks she can simply do as she pleases and get her own way all the time, no matter your opinion. And you need to mean it.", "NTA. \n\nIt may not feel like it now, but she did you a favor. You now see her exactly for who she is and the wedding should be cancelled and you should break up. \n\nYou gave her the only reason you needed to about NOT matching and it was: you didn't like the dress for yourself. It's also your wedding and you get to choose your dress. I am certain she would have a shit fit if you chose her dress for her. \n\n\"She cries even more, accuses me of not loving her, and calls me selfish and I call her pushy and bratty. She then gets up, calls me an a-hole, and begins packing her stuff\". THIS IS MANIPULATION. She went behind your back even after you explained why you're still looking for your own dress and found out about what she did - and no refunds! What right does she have to cry about it? You don't love her because you don't want to match? Well that's just ridiculous and selfish AF. How are you an asshole? You were clear that you wanted to choose your own dress. Last I checked, it was also your wedding. \n\nShe sounds manipulative, controlling and entirely self absorbed. Do not try to reconcile. You deserve someone who encourages you to take your time to find a dress that resonates with you. To be tacky, you deserve to say yes to the dress, not to have her choice forced on you. You deserve better than what she has to offer.", ">i am not willing to throw away a 9 year relationship over a dress. \n\nBut she clearly is. She's the one having a meltdown and trying to manipulate you into doing something you're not okay with. That's not a sign of a loving, accepting partner who will have your back. NTA. Personally I'd be carefully considering my next move and whether I wanted to go ahead with the wedding at all. Her response has been childish at best. Sure, yelling at her wasn't the most adult response either but it pales in comparison to how audacious she's being.", "NTA at all.  First, I don't understand her desire for matching wedding dresses it's just...... bizarre.  It's controlling that she would order you a matching dress against your wishes.  The fact that she had no problem dismissing your feelings and decision making is deeply concerning. Then running away to her mom is a red flag.  If this is the way she handles (self inflicted) conflict, frankly, I would be take this time apart to reconsider this relationship.", "NTA but it\u2019s more than the dress. it\u2019s that she didn\u2019t respect what you said. she lied to you. she cried to make you feel bad which is manipulative. there are a lot of red flags. I truly think couples counseling might help.", "NTA. The way she is behaving now will be what you deal with for the rest of your life if you go through with this wedding. I know you\u2019ve invested 9 years of your life with this person, but are you willing to go through another 70+ like this? This is a minor disagreement that has escalated into manipulation and emotional abuse. Imagine if you have a major disagreement over life decisions. Take this time to yourself to think about how you want your life to be from now on. Good luck to you and I hope you find what will make you truly happy and give you peace.", "NTA, if she wanted matching dresses you should have gone shopping together. It's not only her pick and I think it is a big red flag she doesn't sees it that way. The manipulation after you told her it's not what you had in mind is even worse.", ">She looked upset and asked why I didn't wanna match with her.\n\n>She just said okay and walked off. \n\n>She tells me my fianc\u00e9 already ordered a dress to me online. I ask which dress and she shows me the exact same dress my wife has, and unfortunately, there are no refunds.\n\n>I ask her why did she order that dress without my permission, she acts like she doesn't know what i'm talking about, until I show her the order.\n\n>She starts to cry and says she just wanted me to match with her. \n\n>I told her that I already said I didn't wanna match with her and she told me she thought I would change my mind.\n\n>She cries even more, accuses me of not loving her, and calls me selfish and I call her pushy and bratty.

Because this is just behaviour over a dress. I don't believe for a second someone acts like this only over their spouses wedding outfit. \n\nJust because you've been together for 9 years doesn't mean you should be together forever. If this post is real, it's toxic af.", "NTA. I\u2019m guessing your fianc\u00e9 is used to getting her way, and grew up spoiled and/or privileged, and is now throwing a little tantrum.", "NTA. I'm going through the process of dress shopping atm. Absolutely no one will be picking my dress for me. Most girls grow up dreaming of their wedding dress, of shopping for it and feeling amazing on your wedding day in it. It is so unfair of your partner to take that away from you", "is this a pattern for for to just do things with out asking(big things) and assume or is this the first time?", "NTA. But as others have said, this is about more than the dress. Or it should be for you. She tried to manipulate you into doing what she wants with zero regard for your own thoughts, taste and style. She wants \u201cher\u201d wedding, not \u201cours\u201d. She disregarded what you said, and did what she wanted. \n\nAnd then she has the audacity to be a victim here when you rightly asked her WTF she was doing buying you a dress you do not want. And then ran home to her mother. She\u2019s not acting like an adult ready to navigate marriage. \n\nHoney, please really evaluate what this is showing you about your relationship. She needs to come to you(stop calling/texting her, just drop the rope with her) and apologize for what she did. That is what mature, healthy people in relationship\u2019s do when they messed up- they own up to it. \n\nHopefully you can sell the dress or something.", "NTA.\n\nOrder two dresses you like and tell her if she loves you, then she'll match and wear what you want. 100% guarantee she won't do it.\n\nThis isn't about the dress, it's about having the upper hand in the relationship. If you don't want to leave her, then that's up to you. But time is not an investment in a relationship. Every stock market crashes eventually and either way you lose everything. This is a huge red flag of things to come. Expect many more fights, tears, and packing bags to stay with mommy. I still wish you the best of luck though.", "NTA. Her not responding to your call and texts is classic passive aggressive behaviour. With every call you make that she doesn\u2019t answer the more power (in her mind) she gains over you and the situation, until you finally conceit to wearing that dress. And just for an extra mind F*%k when you get to that point, there\u2019s a good chance she protests you wearing it, only to have you apologize and bag to wear it, then she\u2019ll be ok with you wearing it. Why? Because that\u2019s what passive aggressive people do to mentally F*%k the people around them into doing what they want.", "NTA and thankfully, this is BEFORE getting married.  She disregarded your choice. She decided for you. Then tried gaslighting you for your reaction to HER wrongdoing. \n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Woah... not even married and she already not listen to your wish and going to mommy to escape responsability... futur looks great NTA don't you dare come beging she is the one who is in fault", "NTA. You need to have a serious discussion with her. She needs to understand it's YOUR wedding too so you decide what you want to wear.", "NTA and I would consider not marrying. Too many red flags", "NTA-  she definitely should not have made that decision and bought the dress you said you didn\u2019t like. And just because she thought you would change your mind. That is a complete lack of respect for your feelings and also a failure to include you in a pretty big financial decision, I\u2019m just guessing since it\u2019s wedding dresses. Also she disregarded your clear answer and removed you from consideration thinking only of herself. Now you are getting the silent treatment just for being upset at her many transgressions which is kind of abusive. Since you don\u2019t want to leave her or any of that, I don\u2019t have anything else to say, I respect your choices and hope they led to happiness. You\u2019re not in the wrong", ">I call her pushy and bratty. \n\nNTA  \n\n\nThe fact that her mom agrees tells me where she got this from, if you fold now she won't change and it's only gonna get worse. Stand your ground.", "You might not be willing to throw away a 9 year relationship over a dress, but she is. If she doesn\u2019t respect your wishes over something as simple as this, marriage isn\u2019t going to make that any better. You deserve more.", "DO NOT MARRY THIS WOMAN!\n\nShe will never change. She will bulldozer over you with every choice going forward and never feel bad about it. Count yourself lucky you saw it now because divorces are expensive.\n\nNTA.", "You're NTA. This event is about both of you and her picture doesn't align with your own. It's not a reason to split up, but it is a reason to have a serious conversation. She seems to be steamrolling you, which is never okay.\n\nMaybe you should try to talk with her about how she chose her own dress. Why was it special? Why did she choose it? Why does she want to wear it on her special day with you? Maybe you can begin to reframe this into a conversation about how important and beautiful you want to feel on your special day. It doesn't need to be combative, just honest. \n\n\"You look so beautiful in princess gown, and I feel beautiful in a slim and shorter dress. I want us to both feel the most wonderful for each other.\"\n\nIf she resists, there may be a larger issue. But maybe she has briefly lost sight of things. I wish you two the best of luck.", "NTA- It\u2019s also your wedding day. No one else gets to tell you what dress to wear, not even your bride. You want to feel beautiful on your wedding day. Your fianc\u00e9 took that from you. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to break up over a dress, but you might want to find a way to set healthy boundaries. What she did was wrong. If you don\u2019t have a serious discussion, you will be having these arguments for your whole marriage.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9e sounds very manipulative. Saying \"you don't want to match because you don't love me\" is so controlling af.  \nAnd who buys a wedding dress for the bride, without... the bride!? \nI read that a few suggested marriage counselling and if, you still want to go ahead with marrying her, I think it's the best place to start a healthy marriage. I wish you both the best of luck and I hope you find happiness together.", "OP there's some really good advice on here which I hope you  take on board. I would also suggest you ask your gf to match the dress you want to wear instead of the one she has chosen. That way you'd still match but I get the impression she'd still throw a hissy fit. I get the feeling that if you go ahead with the marriage that you'll find you'll be downtrodden and your feelings and wishes overridden.  Is that really how you want to live your life. Her running to mum rather than talking things out with you, over a dress of all things,  is not a good sign. What will she behave like if something major happens,  job loss, illness etc. Will she be there to support you or run to mum?", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA but I would reconsider marrying.

She's the one who is being selfish putting what she wants on top of what you want. She could have bought her dress and then let you have yours. She's the one who is not behaving like a loving partner given that she completely ignored you. She is also trying to manipulate you into accepting the dress by withdrawing her presence. \n\nThis is not about a dress. This is about her not respecting you.", "NTA. I understand not wanting to leave her, but this isn't just a dress.\n\n* She makes a decision against your express wishes.\n* She tries to lie about it when confronted.\n* She tries to manipulate you with tears and \"You don't love me if you don't do what I want!\" when her lies are exposed. \n* She runs off to her mom and hides out instead of acknowleding she's wrong, which is merely another manipulation tactic.\n\nEverything about this is a problem.", "OP definitely NTA, but you set your boundaries and just let it play out when she's ready to come back.  Yes 9 years is way too long to just throw it all away, but go ahead and find the dress you want, and if she's still not willing to accept what YOU want, then too bad, so sad.  This is your wedding too, not just hers.  She needs to compromise, and if she doesn't then you should just consider postponing the event simply because if she's not willing to respect you decision over a dress then it's going to get much worse afterwards.  Yes, for some reason, nuptials do a number on couples and you need to work through this but don't give in or you'll never be heard when it's most important.", "If she wants to match you sooo bad, why aren't you allowed to choose the dress and she just weras the same?\n\nI think you dodged a bullet there. She tried to pressure you into wearing a dress you don't feel comfortable in on your wedding day. She brushed off your feelings and ordered it anyway. She didn't even tell you, you had to find out from another person. She tried to guilt-trip you into wearing it, because she was crying and the dress is non-refundable. She is punishing you with silence and she presumably didn't tell her mom the whole story, so she would also pressure you.\n\nIf you give her what she wants after this kind of behaviours, you will never have a say in anything again. She will always go ovr your head.\n\nNTA", "NTA. she acted selfishly when she decided she would get her way no matter what.", "NTA\nEmotional manipulation and dramatics such as this show abusive issues.

If your fiancee regular emotionally hijacks a situation to get her own way you need to seriously examine if you want to remain in this relationship.", "You want to keep the relationship, but you want your wife to be to treat you with respect. Well, she has already shown you how that is going to go down, so what do you want us to tell you? This is a huge red flag! YTA for asking for a solution to a problem and not wanting a solution to a problem.", "NTA.    It\u2019s not unreasonable for you to expect to have choice over your own wedding dress.   If she wants to match you need to go shopping together and pick something you both love, she can\u2019t just expect you to accept whatever she chooses for her.", "So, she didnt respect your wish to not wear the same dress. She even went behind your back and order the dress with a non refund police. When confronted, she played the victim, saying it was your fault and the usual gaslighting crap. She runaway like a child and has been giving you the silence treatment. You, the right person in the story, are the one who is calling her non stop to resolve the situation. \n\nHow cant you see that you are NTA?! But you will be one if you keep allowing this women to do everything she wants with you. She seems very toxic and childish. This is how you wanna live your marriage? With her going behind your back, crying when cautch, running away to momma and silence punnishment?!\n\nThis is not about loosing a relationship to a dress. Its about setting boundaries to the future. If you allow her to win this one. She knows she will win all the future discutions, because she know how to guilt trip you.", "LOL, since you are not interested in leaving her, enjoy a lifetime of childish temper tantrums, manipulation and boundary stomping! You are NTA for yelling at her, but you really need to take a long hard look at all the red flags this woman is throwing up and ask yourself why you are willing to put up with that.", "Yikes. Fianc\u00e9 a big baby.\n\nIs this what you want?", "INFO: does she steamroll over your wants and needs all the time or is this a one time occurrence? This is borderline controlling and also sounds quite manipulative. If she does this all the time, I would think twice about spending your life with someone like that. 9 years is a long time but also, 25 is still very young and you still have plenty of time to get married, to her or to someone else.\n\nI'm going to say NTA either way. This is your wedding too. You deserve to have an equal say in this. I would also stop calling and texting her and stop calling her mom. She needs to stop this tantrum because she isn't getting her way. You trying to get her to talk is entertaining her tantrum.

I can't imagine whatnshe was thinking.", "NTA\n\nThis is manipulative behaviour, she is guilt trapping you. And in a very childish way. Is it the stress of the wedding or is it usual behaviour? If it is the second, think very seriously of you want to endure this behaviour for a very long time ...", "NTA. If she was hoping you would wear matching dresses seems to me the thing to do would have been share the idea with you before she selected a dress. If you were game for that then it would have made sense to find one you both love. To expect you to cater to her style isn't fair.", "NTA, but she is gaslighting you into this being your fault for some reason. You have as much right to choose your wedding dress for YOURSELF as she had the right to choose for herself. She is an asshole for insisting you have to have the same dress as her especially when you told her this is not your style and you want something else.", "NTA - she\u2019s manipulating you", "Red flag right there. She tried to manipulate you. She did not succeed so she tried blackmail. -Do as l say or l leave-", "Maybe your the asshole for not wanting to be manipulated, deceived, and forced into wearing a dress you don't like?? Does that make sense to you?\n\nNta\n\nAlso, really sit and think, has behaviour like this shown itself before?", "She seriously wanted you to dress as her twin, not her partner? You're not meant to be a matching pair when you get married - that's such an unhealthy relationship concept. You're meant to be different but therefore complement each other.\n\nNTA.

She is upset because you won't compromise but she isn't willing to compromise for you either.... you both need to seek professional help before you make a lifetime commitment. \n\nIf she won't take your calls/texts then why don't you go to her mum's house and ask to speak? Even if they don't let you in, you can still try - just don't be a d*ck about it and stay calm/civil.\n\nAlso I don't mean to be rude, but I don't understand how you didn't see this coming after being in a relationship with her for 9 years. Is this normal behaviour for her? Because if it is, then does this mean you've always let her have her way in the past? Wouldn't she be like this because you've indulged her repeatedly then?  If it's not, then this may be a red flag or an omen of what your future with her will entail. Anyway, hope this helps and good luck!", "NTA. This is a strange, strange hill for her to die on. I'd say something like \"I love your dress for you, it looks beautiful on you and it's so very your style. It's perfect -- for you. I want a dress that also feels like \"me\". I want to feel **seen** in my wedding dress. I want you and everyone to look at me in my dress on our wedding day and say, that's OP and Fiance, looking so very themselves.

All the wedding planning had been going smoothly until last week, when my fianc\u00e9 tells me she wants to wear matching wedding dresses. She already has hers chosen, while i'm still looking. I've seen her wedding dress and i think it's very beautiful, it just isn't my style. \n\nI told her I wasn't sure and she asked what I meant. I laughed and said \"Well I don't really know if I wanna match.\" She looked upset and asked why I didn't wanna match with her. I told her I loved her dress it just wasn't my style. Her dress was poofy and big, while I preferred more simple and straight dresses. She just said okay and walked off. A few days past, it's Saturday. I go to the dress shop we were getting our dresses from after work and when I walked in the owner of the shop looks confused. She asks \"Well what are you doing here?\". I smile and say well i'm still looking at dresses, remember. Then she looks even more confused.\n\nShe tells me my fianc\u00e9 already ordered a dress to me online. I ask which dress and she shows me  the exact same dress my wife has, and unfortunately, there are no refunds. I apologize to the owner for the inconvenience and go home, waiting for my fianc\u00e9 to get back from work. She gets home after a while and I ask her why did she order that dress without my permission, she acts like she doesn't know what i'm talking about, until I show her the order.\n\nShe starts to cry and says she just wanted me to match with her. I told her that I already said I didn't wanna match with her and she told me she thought I would change my mind. I told her that even if she was 100% sure I was gonna change my mind she shouldn't of ordered the dress without asking me first. \n\nShe cries even more, accuses me of not loving her, and calls me selfish and I call her pushy and bratty. She then gets up, calls me an a-hole, and begins packing her stuff. I ask where she's going and she tells me she's going to stay at her moms for a few days. \n\nI tell her she's being dramatic and she's in the wrong for ordering the dress without my permission first. It's been 3 days Still at her mom's. I've sent her many texts and voicemails, and called her. She hasn't responded. I texted her mom and she told me i was an a-hole for yelling at her.\n\nThese few days I have been feeling really bad and starting to think I may be the A-hole. Also, be before says anything, i am not i instrested in leaving her. I love her more than anyone and i am not willing to throw away a 9 year relationship over a dress. \n\nYour thoughts?

That is disrespectful and extremely manipulative. As mentioned earlier, you are young and have many years ahead of you.
