He passed away 2 months ago due to a heart attack and his pre-existing condition of kidney failure as well. So only then we were informed that he had enrolled himself in a separate insurance program. I filed the insurance claim (as I was the beneficiary), a week after the burial and everything and they said that the minimum wait was 1 month. \n\nMy sister (28F, also working, earning beyond minimum wage) followed up on the claim recently as I said that I wanted to wait for a few more weeks to call and follow up. So she did instead. When she followed up, the company said that it was ready to be claimed but she herself could not claim it because only I had the right to do so. \n\nShe already had it figured out on what was she going to do. She wanted to buy a car for the family - because commuting prices are so high (as if petrol isn't???) she said it would be a practical purchase. I, on the other hand, have hesitations on this plan. Why? Because she also managed our family budget and we always end up short by the end of the month (sometimes not even!) We would lose electricity and even water! Even though the budget is enough or sometimes it was more than enough (I would know because after a few months of that, I requested that I manage the family budget instead). Sometimes, my tuition (I'm on a scholarship, so my tuition would cost around $200 - converted to US currency) would have to be paid in half even though the budget was sufficient enough to pay it in full. I also do not have any allowance, she does not give me any, because we are still conducting online classes. \n\nMy dad was also aware of this, and he would ask me about it as to why only the 2nd week of the month, there was no more budget. Sometimes, he would pay out of his own pocket our food and bills (he's not complaining that he had to, but he does have to pay for his medicine and other stuff he needs) - even though we have the budget for it.\n\nBackground: My parents are separated. My mom sends our budget for us family (my brother and I are still studying, house maintenance and other stuff); my dad lives in the same house as us and pays for his own stuff and even shares in paying bills and even food because he owns a small business.\n\nGiven all of these, I feel like she was hurt that I was the only one written as a beneficiary (you can actually put 3 people; as long as they aren't a minor). But I really do not want to give her the money, for me, I want to save it first, and then save the extra money from our budget until we can actually afford to buy a car and its consistent maintenance. \n\nWIBTA if I didn't give her the money?", "created_utc": 1668768839, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyh8sx/wibta_if_i_didnt_give_my_sister_my_dads_insurance/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And perhaps it is time to take that insurance pay-out and move out of the house and let the others learn to budget and take care of themselves.  You are only responsible for yourself.  Finish your schooling, budget to keep that school tuition going.  I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  Your dad entrusted you purposefully with this money, to spend it wisely, for the benefit of everyone most likely.   Honor that last request/ gift from him to you.", "Not really. But she does visit very often because my mom works far away from home.", "Why split the money when the dad left it to ONLY her? He didnt give any other instructions on it being split. OP dad did what he did for a reason. Sis had to be mishandling the money skimming from the top and leaving everyone else left scrambling. She doesn't deserve it at all.", "That's probably why he left it to you then.

You never tell us what your dad wanted or if he talked to you about it. You also mention a brother, why wasn\u2019t he listed (is it bc he\u2019s a minor bc you said they wouldn\u2019t let minors be beneficiaries) as a beneficiary? Are you going to share with him? There\u2019s a lot of missing info here that could make you the AH. Just because legally your right doesn\u2019t mean your not an AH and I\u2019d like to add if your brother wasn\u2019t listed bc he\u2019s a minor and you don\u2019t share with him I think you\u2019re the AH.", "NTA\n\nYour dad left it to you to do with what you choose.

Your dad deliberately named you as the beneficiary and it seems he did so to enable you to provide for the household in his absence. The household compromises of whomever lives in your home.

He\u2019s now giving you the opportunity to manage the family budget, so make sure that you do. \n\nBudget accordingly. Keep money aside for you and your brother\u2019s tuition. Figure out how much you need for food/bills etc each month and keep that aside (with a little bit of extra room), and give yourself and your brother a small allowance if you can.", "NTA- don't let her change things.

He left the money to her and her alone.", "My dad did not leave any specific instructions as we only found out when the one who handled his account contacted us when they learned of his sudden death. I was the only listed beneficiary. My brother is 13, he cannot be listed as he is a minor - that is why my dad did not list him. \n\nMy main concern is my sister wanting to get ahold of all the insurance claim and spending it on something unwisely -- like a car. I am asking if I would be the asshole to not give her the money to be able the buy a car - as I think it is an impractical purchase at this time.\n\nI never said I did not want to share. I only said I wanted to save it and wait a little bit (so we can save more) to buy a car and maintain it if that is what they want to do with it.", "NTA \n\nHe chose to give it to you, so it\u2019s yours\nJust be ready to burn a bridge though", "NTA and it seems to me that your dad specifically didn't list your sister because he knows she is reckless when it comes to money.

Honor your fathers wishes and keep the money for your own needs.   She has zero claim to it, ZERO.", "NTA. How much money are you talking about?", "NTA. Your dad put your name alone for a reason. If she managed to live without a car before, she can manage to live without a car now. Keep it as a safety net.", "OP, be very careful with that money.  I foresee sister trying to manipulate it out of you.  If she is responsible for chipping in or any bills whatsoever, she will refuse and have you pay them.  Also make sure she cannot take from the communal funds, also leaving you short."]}
