He passed away 2 months ago due to a heart attack and his pre-existing condition of kidney failure as well. So only then we were informed that he had enrolled himself in a separate insurance program. I filed the insurance claim (as I was the beneficiary), a week after the burial and everything and they said that the minimum wait was 1 month. \n\nMy sister (28F, also working, earning beyond minimum wage) followed up on the claim recently as I said that I wanted to wait for a few more weeks to call and follow up. So she did instead. When she followed up, the company said that it was ready to be claimed but she herself could not claim it because only I had the right to do so. \n\nShe already had it figured out on what was she going to do. She wanted to buy a car for the family - because commuting prices are so high (as if petrol isn't???) she said it would be a practical purchase. I, on the other hand, have hesitations on this plan. Why? Because she also managed our family budget and we always end up short by the end of the month (sometimes not even!) We would lose electricity and even water! Even though the budget is enough or sometimes it was more than enough (I would know because after a few months of that, I requested that I manage the family budget instead). Sometimes, my tuition (I'm on a scholarship, so my tuition would cost around $200 - converted to US currency) would have to be paid in half even though the budget was sufficient enough to pay it in full. I also do not have any allowance, she does not give me any, because we are still conducting online classes. \n\nMy dad was also aware of this, and he would ask me about it as to why only the 2nd week of the month, there was no more budget. Sometimes, he would pay out of his own pocket our food and bills (he's not complaining that he had to, but he does have to pay for his medicine and other stuff he needs) - even though we have the budget for it.\n\nBackground: My parents are separated. My mom sends our budget for us family (my brother and I are still studying, house maintenance and other stuff); my dad lives in the same house as us and pays for his own stuff and even shares in paying bills and even food because he owns a small business.\n\nGiven all of these, I feel like she was hurt that I was the only one written as a beneficiary (you can actually put 3 people; as long as they aren't a minor). But I really do not want to give her the money, for me, I want to save it first, and then save the extra money from our budget until we can actually afford to buy a car and its consistent maintenance. \n\nWIBTA if I didn't give her the money?", "created_utc": 1668768839, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyh8sx/wibta_if_i_didnt_give_my_sister_my_dads_insurance/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
