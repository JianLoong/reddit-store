Won\u2019t hold them, won\u2019t look at them. I\u2019ve (F19) always respected her decision and told off anyone in our family who came at her sideways for it. She\u2019s incredibly talented, intelligent, and driven, and I love her so much. However, after this week, I feel resentment building towards her to the point where I can\u2019t even look at her.\n\n\nMy birthday was this weekend. I go to college in a faraway state, so it\u2019s hard to coordinate plans with both friends back home and friends in other states. I\u2019ve struggled making friends in college, so I\u2019ve been incredibly lonely and I wanted my birthday to be a break from that. I came home for break, and managed to gather most of my friends on the same weekend for a movie and dinner. It was all set and planned, and I was SO excited- until my cousin\u2019s (F21) husband suffered a serious car accident and my cousin needed an emergency babysitter. She had no one to ask besides my sister and I- she lives out of the way, her babysitter didn\u2019t respond, and most our family wouldn\u2019t be able to make it quick enough (it was a horrible accident- she wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d survive). \n\nI BEGGED my sister to babysit just this once. I\u2019ve never asked her to watch any kid before, and it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t respect her childfree stance. I just wouldn\u2019t have the chance to have another birthday, with all my friends, and my mental health was so shitty that I needed one day my friends. She said no. \u201cI\u2019m not putting up with a crotch goblin because (cousin) can\u2019t plan properly.\u201d In the end, I cancelled the plans and watched the kid. On my birthday. Alone.\n\nNow to the dilemma- my sister is getting married in June. It\u2019s a wedding on the beach, and I HATE the beach. Bathing suits, sand, the ocean, gulls- all of it. It\u2019s just a mess of sensory issues for me, but I was going to be maid of honor, so I was going to go anyways because I love my sister. After this, I want to step down. After all, why should I put up with a sea of germs and sensory issues because my sister is wants a pretty wedding? I canNOT believe she would rather let me miss my birthday celebration than watch a kid for a night. I know she hates them. I know. But I\u2019d do anything for her, and clearly she wouldn\u2019t for me. So I\u2019m really about to say fuck her AND the damn wedding (to an unbearable man, too). But I don\u2019t want to make a rash decision and miss her (probably) only wedding.

I can't believe people are calling you a martyr. This was an EMERGENCY. It's not like your cousin asked you to babysit so she could go clubbing.\n\nI can see why you're feeling resentful that your sister couldn't step up just that once. And I can also see why you'd not want to make an effort for her because of it.\n\nSo no, you WNBTA. But I do think you'd regret it. Try to view what happened as an isolated flaw. Because apart from that one thing, you have a good relationship and you love her. I think you're justifiably angry right now but in the long run you're sisters who love each other.\n\nI'm sorry you had such a terrible birthday, and I hope your cousin's husband will be okay.", "NTA,\n\nPeople who call martyr are weird,   cousin husband was injured, kids cant go to hospital, some one has to step up, you did it,  you are amazing.\n\nHow do you plan a car accident so you will have baby sitter?  This is beyond me,  because that would planning a murder.\n\n\\_ Oh sorry honey, you cant be in accident today, you have to wait until Thursday?\n\nSo yeah your sister couldn't get passed her fear of children on that day, that sucks.  You don't like the beach,  dont go and tell  her , I cant I dont like seagulls and sand.\n\nHonestly, I have  many friends who has no children by choice but they dont call kids crotch goblin and will baby sit in an  real emergency.   Her stance is just child hating and phobic.", "NTA This is a prime example of Reddit\u2019s craziness - helping out in an emergency is a prime example of what family should do if they are able. You did so, and that speaks volumes to your character. Your sister didn\u2019t- she can\u2019t get past her wants for a brief period of time to help out another person. She does not view herself as being obligated to anyone. The great part about this is that no one is obligated to her. You\u2019ve correctly identified that your sister will not do anything for you, and you should not feel obligated to do anything for her.", "NTA-\n\nSomeone suffered a severe car accident to the point no one knew if he would survive and your sister got mad she didn\u2019t plan childcare? Like how on earth was she supposed to know what was going to happen to her husband? Your sister seems very selfish.", "INFO:\n\nAre you thinking about skipping the wedding as revenge for your sister not stepping up for your cousin / sticking you with babysitting duty? Or are you thinking about permanently cutting out your relationship with your sister because she would not step up to help family when needed in an emergency?\n\nIf it's the former, you probably should go to the wedding - skipping it will have permanent effects on your relationship with her.\n\nIf it's the latter, and you simply don't respect her enough to maintain a relationship, then it's fair to skip this (you're not an asshole if you don't go to a wedding for someone you don't respect). \n\nI realize she might already have permanently tanked the relationship you once had with her, so I'm not comfortable calling you an AH for it, but if you still want a sisterly relationship despite her previous actions you won't get one if you skip to get back at her.", "Your sister hates children more than she loves you. NTA. Don\u2019t attend. Don\u2019t do anything for her ever again. She has proven that she is not your family.", "NTA. Your sister sounds pretty heartless", "NTA. I would even throw her words back at her \u201cyou know I have sensory issues with the beach it\u2019s not my fault you didn\u2019t plan properly\u201d.

Nah, don\u2019t go see if you can celebrate with friends. And I would go Low Contact", "NTA.\n\nBow out of the wedding and stay home.  Besides, if her intended is as insufferable as you imply, it likely won't be her last wedding!\n\n(Refusing to help when a potentially life ending accident occurs and calling it a \"failure to plan\" is a big red flag of an incredibly selfish person.  Don't beat yourself up too much).", "NTA. \n\n\nAlso you are a good person.

You didn't have to. You chose to. And now you're trying to blame your sister for that? You're the insufferable one in this story.", "YTA, for blaming your sister for the birthday thing. Go or don't go to her wedding, that doesn't make you an asshole, but you could have said no to the babysitting as well. That isn't your sister's fault.", "YTA. Respectfully, I understand your cousin\u2019s situation was critical but you could\u2019ve rearranged your night out. Your night out was *not* more important than your cousin\u2019s actual emergency. Your cousin asked *you,* not your sister who (I\u2019m assuming) she knows is childfree and therefore absolutely not a suitable childminder for her kid. In an emergency she didn\u2019t need to worry about her kid in the care of an unsuitable person in addition to worrying whether or not her husband was going to live through the night. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to go to the wedding. Your sister is entitled to her \u201cpretty wedding\u201d because it is *her wedding* and she doesn\u2019t have to cater to your sensory issues. You\u2019re free not to attend due to those. But if you\u2019re thinking of not attending at all because she didn\u2019t babysit a kid once so you could eat some food and watch a film, then you\u2019d be a petty arsehole for that. I guarantee you that you\u2019ll look like a petty arsehole to everyone else who attends as well.", "ESH. Obviously the sister is heartless and selfish for refusing to babysit it those circumstances, and you\u2019re right to be frustrated. \n\nBut, your reaction is pretty severe. Your sister did one shitty thing, and you\u2019re considering dropping out of her wedding that\u2019s 6 months away? I think you\u2019d regret it. \n\nAlso, are you wanting to drop out because you\u2019re pissed about babysitting, or because you hate the beach? Because you should pick an excuse. If the beach bugs you that bad, talk to her about that. If you\u2019re just upset with your sisters actions, then keep the focus on that rather than adding in other excuses.", "OP needs to grow up & stop being petty & get over it & move on. Emergencies happen", "YWBTA - I kind of agree that in those extreme circumstances, sister could have come through for cousin on the childcare, and certainly saying a horrific car accident means cousin \"cna't plan properly\" is BS.  But that's your cousin's fight not yours.  And regardless of any of that, you are trading a lifetime decision over a temporary argument you are mad about.  If you don't go, for all time, whenever sis' wedding pictures get trotted out, it's wait where's humanity-i-think?  Oh that's right she was mad about something so she didn't come.  It's just a way out of proportion reaction that will have repercussions for decades.   Twenty years from now, you probably won't even remember all the details of the childcare, etc.  But your sister will sure remember that you skipped her wedding.", "Some people are afraid of kids.  Your sister is one of them.  She hides it by saying she hates kids.  If your sister is great otherwise, be there for her.  If not, cut her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Choosing not to attend your sister\u2019s wedding will permanently change your relationship. Especially since you are supposed to be the maid of honor.

And it looks like her choice of wedding venue is another instance where she's thinking of herself and not concerned about the impact on her sister.

AITA isn't about what a person HAS to do, its about what they SHOULD do. And in an emergency situation, unless you have a really good reason otherwise, you SHOULD help out your cousin. If the sister had some reason beyond just not wanting to babysit, then I'll change my vote, but as far as I'm aware, she just didn't feel like it.
