His mother was a shitty person. She left him to take care of his little sister, then his little sister died when she was 10 years old and he was only 14 years old. Her death haunts him. In many ways it was just the two of them because his mother was never there for them. Neither knew their father's but it was known they didn't share the same father.\n\nWe met a few years ago and he was open about the hard life he had as a kid and the grief he had for his sister still.\n\nSix months ago a man reached out to my husband and said he believed he might be his father. It rocked my husband's world and he decided he didn't want to know the man or have a part in his family. The guy wanted to know if my husband wanted a DNA test and my husband said no. This man has children too. One of them, his oldest daughter, made contact also, and told my husband he should get to know them and let them into his life. My husband told her no. She did not give up. She called herself his sister and he said he only has one sister and he lost her. Her reaction was to get over his childish need to only have one and accept that he has more people who want to love him. She was told to stay away and stop making contact. But she didn't. She called again and my husband didn't want to deal with her so I answered the phone and told her that my husband was not interested and she needed to leave him alone or the police would be involved next. She wanted to know who the hell I was to talk to her about it. I told her I'm his husband and I was not happy with how she was stalking my husband. She told me I had no right to threaten her and that I am interfere in \"family business\". I told her he's my family and he has been clear with her and her father.\n\nMy husband was thankful I dealt with her for him. But the woman's father messaged and said I should have tried to understand from his daughter's POV and threatening legal action was not the way to go with her.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: I realize I didn't involve a lot of info that might be asked. We believe my husband's mother got the news to his potential father about him and that is why he sought my husband out. He confessed to using a PI to track him down once he had his name. Then they got info on my husband from the PI and looked up his social media accounts which is how the potential father contacted me (via social media). The potential half sister knew info from her father and has used the contact info he got for him.", "created_utc": 1667402129, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yk7wwj/aita_for_threatening_to_involve_the_police_to_a/", "score": 505, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They need to respect your husbands decision whether they like it or not", "NTA:  It was made very clear multiple times that your husband didn't want anything to do with her, asked/told her to stop contacting you.

If you continue to try to contact us, we will pursue legal action.\"\n\nAnd go ahead and call a lawyer now. A restraining order shouldn't be that hard to get if they keep harassing you after that.\n\nSuper important to stop responding to them now, though. Block their numbers, block their social media accounts, and simply forward any future contacts to your attorney. Don't respond to them anymore if they find ways to get calls or messages through.

Block them if you can and keep records of their harassment just in case you do need to take action.", "NTA\n\nThe dad needs to be told that if he doesn't want his daughter to face legal consequences for harassment, then she needs to stop harassing your husband and causing him distress immediately because you WILL follow through if she contacts him again against his will.\n\nThey were told no and they aren't going to get some picture perfect happy family by bullying and demeaning your husband into knowing them while throwing salt into his deepest wounds.
