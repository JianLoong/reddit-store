The house must be maintained and it\u2019s not you that needs to be doing it all the time.  Another option would be to raise the rent to cover a weekly maid service.  $150/wk?  $300 more each per month. Just to cover someone to clean not extra groceries.  Stop grocery shopping. Keep the rent money they are paying.  They can go grocery shopping for themselves.  You really need to stop momming them both.", "NTA,\n\nYou\u2019re definitely not in the wrong here.

Firstly, they need to pay rent and contributions to the bills and food as they are currently jeopardising by our ability to retire as you are paying these extras. Work out their fair share (2/3 or half) of all bills, including food.\n\nIf they are not able to do this, then they are also not able to afford the mortgage and living there on their own.

And raise the flipping rent on them. After a month, thirty days to pack-up and move when they don't change (because they won't).\n\nYou would just be hurting yourself by moving. You know deep in your heart they will not take care of the place. So when the home gets foreclosed on, you are the one who will have to deal with all of that. You are the one who's credit gets destroyed. They'll just pack up and try to find their next victim to leech off of.", "NTA for wanting to leave the situation, but aren't the mortgage and other bills in your name? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would suggest as a better solution to either kick them out, or you move out and get your own place.

Are you giving them the house and equity in it? It would seem that way. If you expecting them to pay rent to cover the mortgage then you need an agreement from them first.", "NTA.

They won't pay it. Kick them out.", "NTA for wanting to leave -- however, its not the answer. It just gives them free reign to do as they please, without paying.\n\nI would set up a time to talk with them, and tell them that you are negotiating (or renegotiating) a rental agreement. Have the rental agreement paperwork with you, and hammer out the details with them. \n\nThey have to pay their fair share of rent, utilities etc. (write it in the agreement) they have to maintain the premesis, keep it clean and tidy. Etc etc. Then make them sign it. You want things legally done, so that IF push comes to shove, you can go to court and have them removed legally. \n\nIf they refuse, then tell them they have 60 days to find other living arrangements, that you will help them move when they find a place, and if they dont find a place within the 60 days, then you will have the sheriff evict them.\n\ntbh if they are old enough to make a child, then they are old enough to take responsibility for raising that child, without mooching off of you.

They should leave or at the very least pay for the cleaners to come.  Selling the place might be the better option since you you can then avoid confrontation and all the unpaid cleaning.", "Walking away isn\u2019t helpful to you or your children. It\u2019s better to ask them to leave so they can develop independence and your relationship with them won\u2019t suffer anymore. NTA but don\u2019t walk out :)", "Nope....I'm in a similar boat. If my youngest 2 weren't 7 and 12 I'd have done it by now. Maybe just build a tiny home in the back. If I had a house and some land I would have them all just build their own tiny home and put them in the backyard.", "NTA. But, good luck with that. You have made them comfortable and they have taken advantage of you.\n\nSet your boundaries, leave the house and only go home to sleep. Let them figure the rest out. They will become more family oriented when they are forced to do it.\n\nYou love your grandchildren, but, they are not your children. Let their parents take care of them and you focus on getting yourself together. If not, this will continue and continue with you possibly ending up resenting them. You really don't want the family drama of you love the other kids more than her and her kids coming up. \n\nSet the boundaries and let them know they have to change their behavior.

It may work, if not, you have given them ample warning.", "Soft YTA\n\nI understand the frustration you have regarding the situation but packing up and leaving is not the answer to the situation. Why should **you** have to leave **your** house?\n\nObviously you shouldn't just kick them out either because they have a kid and that is important for the context. \n\nHelp them move out.

If they can't clean, you think they'll pay?\n\nYou need to boot the moochers out. Take back your house!  Your kid is 24, married, and has a kid. It is time to get them out of the nest.

However, I seriously want to just pack up my things and leave!\n\nTake a breath. Have you had a conversation with them about moving out or finding a place to stay that isn't with you? Have you told them that you're considering leaving the residence due to their cleanliness? Your child is 24 and her baby daddy is 25. They're adults. They're likely burnt out from raising a kid for the past 4 years and working all the time. \n\nHave adult conversations with them. No one is the asshole here.
