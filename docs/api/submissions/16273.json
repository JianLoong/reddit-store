And please tell her that the cord was cut at birth.", "That was my initial feeling. But with how I was raised in a not very stable home. I always feel guilty, but this time I\u2019m not going to act like it\u2019s my fault.", "Exactly. I definately love my mother like no other person, and I also love my girlfriend like no other person. It was really weird how she just randomly said that, as if I ever made her feel less important than anyone ever.", "Yes it has been a long while and I agree with you, and her to some extent. Thing is, she can fly to me anytime she wants. It\u2019s only a 2h30m flight. If I can\u2019t, she most definately is welcomed to me anytime..", "Who can just ditch work for 2-4 weeks?  Especially when they \u201cjust got out of a hard financial situation.\u201d\n\nEven if they\u2019re in a country where generous paid leave is standard, that would have to eat up most of their PTO.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable at all.", "Good for you. Spend your money on a trip where you'll actually enjoy yourself. NTA", "Whether it's  your current gf or another in the future, this attitude of your mom won't stop. You might want to start browsing on the JNMIL sub to read the experiences of others when mothers treat their son's gfs/wives like romantic competition (wanting to always be your number one priority is not normal or healthy for an adult child/parent relationship) just to prepare yourself for what boundaries you might need to set.", "NTA - I live overseas and my family lives in the states. I\u2019m moving this year from one country to another, and while i miss my family and they miss me, they understand that visiting isn\u2019t always possible and any time is a gift. I got lucky with my situation and am able to visit them this year before I move, but they understood that I had to clear some hurdles before it was a for sure thing.", "NTA. Two weeks to a month is an extremely demanding request for someone who, I\u2019m guessing, works full time and has their own life to deal with. Especially considering you\u2019ve just gotten out of a rough financial situation.\n\nBringing your partner into it is just uncalled for and weirdly hostile? Is there any bad blood between them two? Idk, it feels very out of pocket to blame your girlfriend when, as you said, your whole life is based there. \n\nAlso, if she\u2019s that bothered, what\u2019s stopping her from visiting you? All I\u2019m seeing are excuses and entitlement. I\u2019d be inclined to wait for a sincere apology before booking anything.", "So, stay for two weeks to an entire month or don't come at all. What an odd take. NTA.", "NTA. Your mom started in on you with an aggressive, unprovoked guilt trip. Maybe just cancel the trip for now until she works through whatever this problem she is have is.", "NTA", "NTA. And it sounds like your mom is jealous of your girlfriend. Does she expect that she will be the only woman in your life forever, or that she will always be your #1, even after you get married?", "If your mother sees no point in your visit then take a holiday elsewhere. \n\nIt can be hard seeing your kids grow up but it's the joy of being a parent. Your girlfriend will b a bigger priority to you now and that is normal too. NTA", "NTA, and you should make the visit the length you want, but I'd urge you to remember that your mom isn't trying to be mean -- she just wants more time with you because she loves you.  So I'd try to explain nicely to her that you have a bunch of stuff going on at home, so you can't stay for 2 weeks, but you're looking forward to visiting with her, hanging out, going for walks (or whatever she likes to do), etc. -- and don't let it escalate into an argument.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  Your mom is being selfish & manipulative.  She's intentionally trying to make you feel guilty for not staying longer.  She should just be happy that you're coming at all.", "NTA. \n\nShe's upset that your choosing to live on your own and be an adult. Instead of living with her and allowing her to take care of all your needs. While you take care of her financially. \n\nShe's upset that your choosing to live your life outside of her house and her control. Instead of living with her and ppaying husband. \n\nYou need to talk with your mom and find out why she's so upset. Then express that you an adult and you like living where you are. \n\nHave an open talk, set boundries and find ways to compromise on visits.", "I will go sit in that mud puddle until you do what I say.", "\"saying why the hell do I want to sit in n country B for so long\" this may be me reaching but I think your mom id fully expecting you to come to her country and stay for good eventually, anyways just keep that in mind in case it's something that you need to make clear with her.", "NTA", "Nta sadly I've heard of plenty of mothers acting like a jealous girlfriend when their sons grow up", "As someone from the UK living in the US, you can simply tell your mum that she does not need to worry then, as you will spend the time visiting other family and friends instead. \n\nI've had these discussions and we have to put our foot down and set boundaries. Even friends give us crap if we are not going to see them personally - as in drive to their house to hang out. We shut that crap down immediately.  \n\nWe tell everyone when we are coming, and where we will be during that time in the UK, which is either two or three locations, hundreds of miles apart. If they are unable to meet us and travel an hour or two to see us after we have spent the money to fly thousands of miles to get there, as well as drive over a thousand miles after landing, then it's on them. We did our part. \n\nNTA", "NTA. This sounds like a bit like a cultural thing too. My relatives in the UK are surprised Americans only get 2 weeks off TOTAL at most full time jobs before it starts to eat into sick days. Not saying that\u2019s an excuse for your mom, I think it just shows that everyone views things through their own culture", "NTA. I wouldn't go until she apologizes and MEANS it!

That means settling down in a career , a home, and a SO.  I missed  my child when they moved out i had the  empty nester blues. I felt lonely, but those are my feelings to manage. You are not responsible to manage your moms feelings. I\u2019m glad my child is out living their best life and I know they love me. You live your best life and don\u2019t let anyone even mom make you feel guilty. Dont be disrespectful but make clear your boundaries.", "NTA you're an adult with your own life, you don't have a month to just go hang out with her!  4-5 days or nothing.

I don't know what country OP is coming from but if it's North America where we get ludicrously short vacations it makes sense. If you get 5-6 weeks vacation per year a 2-3 week ask doesn't sound unreasonable to the asker.", "There is an [insta](https://instagram.com/the.holistic.psychologist?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) I really like and makes posts about these kinds of things often, it might be worth checking out! She posts often about family dynamics, healing from traumatic childhoods/situations, and ways to take care of ourselves. It\u2019s very validating to be honest.\n\nYour response made me think of it, that initial feeling being followed by the response that was created as the norm growing up. You were right in your initial feeling, it\u2019s good to acknowledge where the guilt comes from and why, but holding strong in your initial response is good. Take care of yourself OP, you\u2019re doing great \ud83d\udc96", "I say it to my mother all the time.  She LOVES it! Okay, she doesn't love it, but she gets the point.", "She\u2019s making your gf into the scapegoat so she doesn\u2019t have to look at her own behavior or choices\u2026 which is ridiculous.

When you get married, your husband comes first.'  \n\n\nIt's the same for any long-term partner and your mother knows that. Her jealousy is her problem. She needs to get over it.", "I'm so sorry.  NTA at all.  My in-laws are so awful about the length of visits that we actually just stayed within 45 minutes of them at spring break and didn't tell them.  We live 1000 miles away.  But this has been going on for 20 years (the guilting) and we had a hard year so we just decided we couldn't deal with the stress.  \n\nWhat's wrong with these people - you WANT to see them for 4-5 days.  Then they make it so miserable that they got zero days!", "NTA Your Mom is looking at this from a financial aspect. If it costs a lot to visit your Mom, it makes sense to have a long visit, since they are rare, unless it\u2019s a toxic environment. My extended family members who have relatives in other countries usually go for 3-4 weeks due to infrequency and cost of traveling. I only visit one sibling for 3 days as his late wife did not like our family.  So I combined visits to him with visiting entertainment some miles away and stayed in hotel.  Anyway, given this world view, she likely feels hurt that she is not important enough.  What makes her an asshole is her all or nothing attitude.", "NTA. You tried. But if she wants to argue witj you instead of having you visit, that's on her. It sounds like she never learned how to be vulnerable, so she attacks, instead of asking for what she wants or needs. That must be exhausting for you.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu SHOULD care more about your gf than about your mom. Your mom is your past, your gf has the potential to become your life partner and your future.", "NTA. If that\u2019s how she feels, save your money and don\u2019t go. Because I bet if you do go she will just whine the whole time that you aren\u2019t staying long enough.", "*She then started accusing me of caring about my girlfriend more than her* \n\nWell in the normal course of events that's how it should be. As you settle down with a partner, they should become more important that your parents.", "NTA WTF Has anybody pointed out to your mom that talking like that will only make you want to avoid being around her/talking to her?", "NTA. Your mother is demanding she selfish.", "NTA. Your mom seems to think this is a competition for your affections. Doesn't she have a caring significant other in her life? I've only had daughters myself, but I have observed that some mothers are weirdly inappropriate and possessive of their sons. She doesn't want to lose her position as the most important person in your life. What she's doing isn't healthy and you need to set clear boundaries now and stick to them.", "she just misses you I'm guessing. All the people saying she's abusive from such a short exchange blows my mind.", "Nta but to me you should still go and vists . Mums are weird sometimes and even though she is coming off very mean it\u2019s coming from a place of love . Family is family and regardless of what people on Reddit tell you it\u2019s not worth abandoning it unless she\u2019s been abusive to you in past . \n\nYou aren\u2019t the asshole for being offended by what she said but I would still go because eventually you won\u2019t have the option \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.", "NTA\n\nVisiting also goes both ways, why has your mom not picked up everything and visited you for two weeks to a month?

Gosh who wants that?", "It's the same for any long-term partner and your mother knows that. Her jealousy is her problem. She needs to get over it.", "Yeah\u2026I had a coworker who\u2019s 19 ask for 2 weeks off in a row to go with her long term boyfriend and his family on vacation. The manager was barely willing to give her 1 full week because she\u2019s a lead and it\u2019s the middle of summer even though they\u2019ve run the store with only 2 leads on the whole payroll yet can\u2019t give a teenager vacation when there\u2019s 3 leads and a backup that will be trained by the time her requested time is to be here. But she told her that even if she was a normal associate, she still wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve approved both weeks and acted like with her being a lead, giving her 1 week was a favor. I know this because I was present during the conversation because our lockers are in the office and I was coming in for the day. And she is definitely not the worst manager I\u2019ve ever had (though she\u2019s a very close second and that\u2019s only because there is literally one thing she\u2019s shown she recognizes and that\u2019s that corporate will never approve a fully staffed payroll so she \u201cpencils in\u201d for forgiveness because she knows it\u2019s the only way to run the store. Even with only 2 person coverage she has to do that so it\u2019s pretty bad)", "#THIS", "I will go sit in that mud puddle until you do what I say.", "That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking. She\u2019s (presumably) the one who chose to move to another country. She likely just misses OP. She\u2019s not wrong to feel this way, but instead of accepting that limited contact with her child is the result of HER life choices, she shifts the blame to OP\u2019s girlfriend. Which makes her TA."]}
