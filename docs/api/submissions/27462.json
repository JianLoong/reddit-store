We had a good foundation to start with & built off of that. So it\u2019s solid!\n\nWe have the same financial values & goals. We both agreed on the game plan & the team has done well. It\u2019s never been 50/50. It\u2019s whatever it needs to be to live our lives, take care of our family & be happy. Money is not emotional. It\u2019s just a tool to be used to build your life.", "How am I abusing him?", "Expecting him to link his finances to yours blindly to assuage your inability to stop acting like your family.\n\nTaking your emotional problems out on him.\n\nInsulting him and telling him he is the one with a problem when he objects to your bizarre behaviour.\n\nTelling him that his accurate understanding that you do not trust him is untrue, while continuing to demonstrate and act on your lack of trust for him.\n\nJust be honest. Tell him upfront: \u201cif I tell you about my finances, you will start acting like a gold digger, and nothing you do will ever convince me otherwise.\u201d Say the words you mean out loud. The longer you lead him on with the idea you love or trust him, the longer you spend insulting him and undermining his accurate assessments of how your treat him, the more abusive you\u2019re going to get. Just like your relatives.", "While paying his 50% share he might have to spend 80% of his monthly income and while you make more money than him you will be enjoying your luxury on his expenses i.e financial abuse.\n\nI earn 3 times more than my gf and i pay 75% of our monthly expenses and i still have more money than her this is called being equitable. What you are proposing is exactly a financial abuse."]}
