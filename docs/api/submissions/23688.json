One of the guys coming, let's call him John said that he would organise the meat and bbq etc. And that we could just pay him back on the day. I ended up inviting a friend of mine also, as I thought this wouldn't be a problem.\n\nThe day comes around and I'm heading there, John messages me and asks me to pick up some plastic cups and other items, which I happily did. Anyway, I get there, introduce my friend and everything is fine I thought. One guy showed up with a cooler full of beers like some craft beer Santa and all was going well. Then the trouble starts, John  is cooking the meat (poorly I might add) and shoving half cooked sausages at everyone. I took some and thought they were awful as they weren't cooked through. John was going on about his \"meat hookup\" as we live in a country where it can be difficult to get certain items as easily in the west. \n\nAnyways, things are wrapping up and John asks me for money to cover the cost of \"my share\". He wants 5000 yen (about $50 USD). I thought this was ridiculous as I didn't want the sausages anyway and I thought that my contributions (cups, utensils etc.) was more than enough to cover my share anyway. I didn't see anyone else paying and I didn't have cash on me anyway so I just said no. My friend also didn't pay. He kept going on about how expensive the meat is because these sausages aren't easily found here blah blah and that it was reasonable. I disagree and won't be paying him. Now he is complaining to all our mutual friends but I don't think I've done anything wrong, it's still not clear to me if anyone else paid.\n\nAITA here?\n\nEDIT: I also brought some nice wine, John had a lot of it, although this wasn't something I was requested to bring like the utensils, cups, lighter etc.", "created_utc": 1690940137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fv6t6/aita_for_not_paying_my_fair_share_at_a_bbq/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They don't get to join for free. \n\nLastly dude you bought plastic cups and utensils. Literally the cheapest thing you can bring.... pay your share", "YTA.  You agreed to John\u2019s terms by showing up instead of agreeing in advance about how much.  Beer and meat are much more expensive than plastic cups so it\u2019s clear you are not contributing your fair share.", "Yta\n\nThe deal was, he buys the meat, you pay him back. He kept up his end. \n\nIf you didn't like how it was cooked, then tell him what's wrong with the cooking at the time, and unless the problem is it being overcooked, you can try to fix it. \n\nIf you didn't like the price, then that's something that should have been discussed *before*. He's a bit the ah there also, but you didn't have to agree to pay a mystery price at a later date.", "ESH...it sounds like the arrangement/agreement across all parties was not clearly stated.  You did agree to pay him and in the ask about go sen yen (5000 yen), you could have mentioned your contribution to the party.  The interesting part is that the beer santa did not ask for any money", "Create a group chat and have everyone send their costs (mest/beers/ cups/plates etc). Then divide the total between every single Person that attended (your friend included). You cannot count who ate/drank more or pay based on how much you liked/disliked the food. If you do not want to pay because you don't know if others have paid YTA, that should not matter , each should pay what is their share and that's it", "YTA, you should have told John your friend was coming and you should have at least paid the amount minus your contributions. I\u2019m not surprised John is badmouthing you to your mutual friends.", "Yeah.... I'm thinking YTA. There was a huge lack of communication all around. You agreed in advance to pay your share, but you're refusing to pay because you don't agree with the price. But you also don't want to pay because he (allegedly) undercooked the meat, and you clearly didn't like his attitude around bragging about getting the meat.  Why didn't you put the sausage back on the grill if it was so undercooked?  You clearly had no problem speaking up about not paying, why didn't you speak up about it being undercooked?\nJust because you didn't hear him asking others for money doesn't mean he didn't ask.\n\n\nSometimes we have to pay for things we don't want to, c'est la vie. I was out $100 US, once, because my friend organizing the day of events didn't time things right and we missed this class that cost $100 each. I didn't want to pay them at all because the poor time management for each thing we were doing was on them, but I paid anyway because it was the price of my ticket. At the end of the day our group could have tried to push timings to try to make it to the class in time, and we didn't, so it's on all of us for not communicating.", "YTA. \n\nYou could have deducted the cost of the plastic picnic items from the 50 dollars but instead you decided to just refuse to pay all together AND you brought a guest without paying for the guest. You agreed to contribute to the cost of food. \n\nNext time just turn down the invite if you are invited again.", "ESH but you might be a bit more of an asshole than your friend.\n\nI live in Japan too, so I get it.\n\nMeat is expensive, certain cuts rare, and bbq equipment is dookie.\n\nYou and your friends organized it, you and your friends decided to pay back John on the day.\nThat was agreed upon.\n\nIf you and your friends also wanted to be compensated for the stuff you brought, that should've been communicated prior.\n\nJohn also should've been more communicative about the meats.\nI would've let the group know before hand, what meats I'll be bringing and the total price of the shit I bought.\n\nCommunication is the key, its really not that hard...", "I assume you're in Japan due to the use of the YEN.

Was there any leftover? How many people were involved in this bbq?\n\nYou only mentioned sausages but even for \"expensive\" sausages, $200 for 4 people (I'm assuming it was only you, your friend, John, and beer guy) is kinda excessive. If there were even more people, then that's even worse. At the moment, I don't think you're an AH but more info would be helpful.", "ESH.\n\nYou said you'd pay for your food.\n\nBut on the other side, 5k yens is waaaaay too much, John was probably trying to make some cash from the event at everyone's expense. \n\nMy barbecues usually end up costing \\~1500 to 2000 yens per person, alcohol included (but I make sausages, skewers and marinades myself since what you can find in Japan is just too low quality and too expensive).\n\nIf he wanted to buy some rare and expensive sausages, that should have been communicated in advance, with a cost estimate to make sure nobody gets surprised by the steep price.", "YTA\n\nYou messed up not checking ahead of time when you agreed\n\nMeat is expensive", "Pay your friend", "First, your storytelling skills leave a lot to be desired. \n\n\u201cSo me and some friends organized a BBQ \u2026\u201d\nDoes that mean a handful of you organized a party for dozens and dozens of people (handful paying, dozens or more eating) or was it just the three of you getting together (and you brought a fourth without telling everyone)?\n\nIf it was a big party, the fact that you brought a friend shouldn\u2019t matter and they should not be considered one of the \u201cpaying\u201d hosts just because they arrived with you. \n\nYou said your friend didn\u2019t pay, but did anyone ask him to? Or was the Meat Man asking you for $50 to cover both you and your friend ($25 each)?\n\nRegardless, you used \u201cI didn\u2019t have any cash anyway\u201d as an excuse for not paying. That alone means YTA because if your buddy had asked you for $10 instead of $50, you still would not have been able to pay. \n\nAlso, the quality of the cooking has nothing to do with your agreement to reimburse John for the meat.", "OP really thought plastic cups and utensils  were equivalent to 5000 yen. I get if he wants that deducted, but he\u2019s refusing to pay at all. The wine doesn\u2019t even count because he wasn\u2019t asked to bring it. \n\nAlso YTA for using \u201cI didn\u2019t like the food\u201d after eating it as an excuse not to pay. You can\u2019t even do that at a restaurant.", "Just to clarify, the beer wasn't related to John at all, it was a different guy who brought those and he didn't ask for any money.", "That could have very well been his contribution to the party, I'd bet John didn't ask him to pay for any of the meat because he supplied the whole party with beer.", "John should at least learn how to be a competent grillmaster before he starts asking people to pay for his meat", "John set the rules and OP didn\u2019t follow them and brought a friend", "It was....John said he would pay for the meat and everyone would pay him the day of the BBQ.", "It was about 10-12 people. There was no meat leftover, in fact John was complaining he didn't get to eat, and 2-3 of the people that came didn't eat at all. There were some \"gourmet\" sausages and lamb cops and some other basic things", "It was 10-12 people. Nobody I've spoken to paid anything, they got credit for the stuff they brought I suppose I.e beer guy. There was also nowhere near enough meat for 2500y x 12 people let alone 5k (he expected my friend to pay the same)", "For real, like, idk, maybe I am the asshole but if you want me to pay you for the meat you brought to the party it needs to have been edible???", "It wasn't specific enough.  And this is a dumb argument even for this sub.  I am changing my ruling to don't give a rat's ass.", "Offset by the cost of the cups, etc.  The agreement was not specific enough.", "Let's take a look at what we know. \n\nOne guy paid for all the meat another paid for all the beer and got craft beer so it's probably a tad bit pricey.  Than there's OP who shows up with another person and bought cups and plates. \n\nDo you really think that cancels each other out lol. Especially when OP added another person who didn't contribute.", "OP brought wine too.", "NTA I don\u2019t think you were. You had bought things with YOUR own money that helped contribute to the party. John cooked poor meat and shoved it in your face that you clearly didn\u2019t want. He should have asked and may I remind you that he cooked it poorly. People buy \u201cexpensive\u201d meat and cook it poorly means their trying to get money off you. I really don\u2019t think you at the AH in this. Wine is also expensive if he\u2019s drinking a lot of it he was probably to wasted to even consider that he was doing a poor job. People may have gotten sick at half Cooked food. Also if he was cooking and if it was a party why are you bringing the things the host/hostess should being buying?", "That does not excuse you.  In fact, it makes matters much worse.\n\nPay John the money that you owe him. Since you bought another person to the BBQ, you need to pay for two peoples food.\n\nNext, you need t pay the person who purchased the beer some money as well.\n\nIt does not matter that you did not see others pat John. They may well have paid John already.  \n\nThe fact that John asked you for money makes me suspect that you are notorious for not paying people back for what you should.\n\nKeep this behaviour up and you will no longer be invited to anything.", "Hmm... Lamb chops are usually kind of expensive. I don't know the going price for where you're at but for me it can range from $15 to $50 per lb (~450g), depending on a myriad of factors. If anything, that would be more likely to be the biggest expense compared to the sausages, unless the sausages literally have truffles in them. I would recommend everyone providing their receipts and go from there. \n\nMy judgement would ESH. It sounds like John intentionally and unilaterally chose expensive cuts of meat. He also failed to properly cook and prepare the meat. I don't blame you for not wanting to pay a seemingly excessive amount but you should still pay your fair share.", "YTA\n\nYou all agreed to split the cost of the meat. He bought enough for everyone.\n\nIf you didn't eat it, that's on you. You could have simply asked him to cook your food longer. It's not like you're too shy to speak up for yourself. You had no problem speaking up when it came to refusing payment.", "Him buying the meat doesn't give him the right to massively overcharge his friends to make a profit. I very much doubt that he bought sausages for $50 per person.", "This is absolutely spot on. But I'd add that, assuming OP is a reliable narrator (given they're the only one we have) and from my own experiences of BBQs in the West, they're equally AHs as it's very likely John did serve them undercooked, inedible meat. I can absolutely understand not wanting to pay for food you haven't been able to consume but someo e should've directly told him they were undercooked and needed to be cooked further.\n\nAs you said: it's all about communication.", "This seems more like a 'dude trying to profit by overcharging his friends' situation instead of actually splitting the cost though.", "If someone wanted to charge me $50 for a single portion of sausage i wouldn't have paid them either. I don't like getting scammed.  \n\nDoubt the guy actually spent hundreds of dollars buying sausage, and if he really did he should have asked in advance if anyone besides him wanted to spend that much for sausages.", "It\u2019s Japan, meat is expensive, and western foods are often charged at a premium. OP didn\u2019t say he only had a single portion, only that the sausages weren\u2019t good. Even if he had doubts about how much the sausages cost, OP is still the AH for not paying anything when he said he would, especially since he brought a friend who also refused to pay. 5000 yen is also closer to 35 USD these days, so OP\u2019s math is also way off.", "I've spoken to these people online, they've told me they weren't asked to pay anything. I brought just as much stuff to share as anyone else and yet was still asked to pay 5k yen each for me and my friend. I think I was the only one specifically asked to bring certain items (cups, utensils, lighters, briquettes) at the last minute, we still brought things like wine and other drinks to share and didn't expect any compensation. There's no way this guy bought 100k yen worth of meat and therefore it was a completely unreasonable request to ask us for that. I think he realised he fucked up and wanted to recoup some losses by getting me and my friend to cover the cost.", "That's still way beyond what is reasonable to expect to have to pay for a casual BBQ with a bunch of friends imo.  \n\nIf a friend asks to split a bottle of wine at a party you can't just show up with a bottle of Ch\u00e2teau Mouton-Rothschild and demand $600 from them unless you checked with them beforehand."]}
