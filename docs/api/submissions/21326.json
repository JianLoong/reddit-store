They only know that if somebody hurt them or did something wrong to act out with honesty, which she did. What about the fact that by the age of eight SILs should know what a tattletale is, which is what she did.

That should have been the end of it. \n\n But SIL thought she should be able to discipline her.

Teaching children to bottle up how they feel and never speak their opinion out loud is messed up.  \n\nSIL sounds like a shitty person to be around, and OP doesn't seem to like her either why would he discipline his child for voicing what everyone is already thinking?  \n\nThis has the same vibe as the forcing your child to hug/kiss people.  \n\ngood on you OP for sticking up for your girl and showing her you don't have to put up with BS just because your sibling married an asshole.", "Kids say I hate you all the time.

SIL is definitely a crappy person, but that doesn't excuse disrespectful behaviors.", "Maybe this is a cultural difference then because this would not fly amongst most of my people.

That's my whole point.  she didn't insult SIL.  \n\nThe initial situation was handled well, it was likely an emotional outburst that wasn't rooted in fact( ie OP's daughter does not actually hate her cousin).\n\nThe daughter was giving honest feedback on the SIL's behavior.  I do think adults should not fight in front of children, but that's a hard thing to maintain when conflicts like this arise. \n\nI would not hold my daughter accountable for telling my (ex)SIL that she doesn't like her(she does).\n\nI guess all that to say we have different opinions on what behaviors are bad/unacceptable", "NTA.\n\nThis SIL is awful. No gender reveal for her, nothing from now on. Your mother and MIL of course are siding with her.

An adult shouldn\u2019t double down on reprimanding a child (especially a five year old) so i think you were rightfully upset and your daughter\u2019s reaction is normal for her age despite what others are saying because kids don\u2019t have the mental capacity to fully understand what they are saying but since it happened twice it might be worth having a talk to her about it to prevent it from happening again. Since this situation did happen after you were babysitting it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if you decided not to do it anymore imo. As for the baby shower, your mother and mother-in-law sound free so if you and your wife aren\u2019t up to it considering her rude behaviour and lack of an apology they can take it up. But I do think you should be the bigger person and make right what you did wrong by admitting your mistake if not it would mean that you suck too.

About an hour later she came down to the living room, crying because she felt guilty and apologized and we talked about our feelings and all was good again. However she said it again a couple of years later, when I said told her no, she could not have a sleepover at our house since I was pregnant and in danger of giving birth prematurely, and she apologized again. \nMy point is, children say a lot of things they don't mean because children have no filters and don't know how to regulate their feelings properly. And you are not supposed to yell at them for it, you are supposed to talk to them about it and explain the words and feelings.\n\nNTA by the way.", "Nta stop engaging with her. That blow out should have never happened. Take 6 months and give yourself some space, go low contact", "NTA.  Only read the title.", "Y'all all sound like you have just lovely communication. Just lovely. \nThat said 5yos say mean but true things. It's who they are. You talked to her and that should have been the end of it.  8 yos get butt hurt about any social slight.

I also don't like your sister in law.", "I think my issue is that the conversation he had with his daughter didn't make any difference since she was very quick to immediately say something nasty to her aunt.

I deducted 39 dollars which was the actual cost of the beef dish and then paid my split and told her that I was doing this. \n\nAs for my SIL I only treat her exactly how she treats me at the moment because her attitude changes every time I see her.", "NTA: It seems like your daughter has a better grasp on how to handle her feelings than your SiL.

Either way, I'm guessing they'd long since gotten rid of bottles, clothes, the baby monitor, the crib, etc. and would likely need everything all over again.", "It\u2019s not even a shower, it\u2019s a stupid gender revel", "OMG! Let me tell you! You have a baby shower for the first. Then, there is a \"sprinkle\" for a subsequent, differently gendered baby. Then, if there is a wider spread in ages, you get another big baby shower! That doesn't include any gender reveals. I constantly bleed money for showers, etc.", "Haha same, I'm 'a mean Mummy!' one minute, 'the best Mum in the world' the next according to my 5yo.", "When my daughter was four she spent a lot of time telling us gleefully that she hates us in response to \"I love you\". We explained that hate is a big word, what it means, and that words can hurt feelings -- but sometimes we do hate things. \n\nIt was a phase and it passed, lol.", "Jfc I don't even want to know how hard that is once they learn the word. Definitely have a bad mouth, so does my wife. Planning kids soon \ud83d\ude02.", "Dad did just fine.  He talked to her about saying \"I hate you\" and the girl apologized. \n\nShe's 5. Five years old. It takes more than one reprimand for her to learn. And she said \"I don't LIKE you\" because the aunt started cursing and yelling.", "I don't know why you're getting downvoted.\n\nEven though we're only hearing this story from Dad's side, his 5 year-old is coming across as needing some guidance about what is an appropriate and inappropriate thing to say to someone when you disagree with them.\n\nJumping straight to \"I hate you\" and \"I don't like you\" is not something I would let continue and Dad doesn't seem to be able to nip it in the bud because here's 2 instances in the one afternoon and he's more defensive /indulgent than anything else.", "How DARE a child say something kind of mean!!!", "because he\u2019s a fucking man lmfao", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "1) that not your problem\n\n2) then your mom can organise it", "I mean\u2026", "After a sprinkle, would it be a spot?", "I did teach one of my nieces to say \"fucking\" by accident when she was two. It was hilarious and mortifying at the same time. I think she was 4 when I taught her to say arsehole. Got in so much trouble for that one.", "Almost like it wouldn't have done her any harm to hear it again from her aunt, eh? If hearing the same message again is what she needs.\n\nDad obviously did a dog shit job because \"I don't like you\" was her go-to when she got mad at her aunt\n\nAnd he \"lost his shit\" by his own admission. And this story is from his point of view and he and Countess Bratula *still* come off badly even when it's his narration - given  everyone retells a story with their own biases, fuck knows how rude they both were.\n\nI'm calling it.\n\nCountess Brattybreeches has her nose out joint because she has a 1 month old brother and is being unbearable (and maybe even regressing slightly) and Dad's solution is to let her be as rude as she wants as long as it's not to him because he's not up to the job of actually parenting.", "So kids aren\u2019t allowed to stand up for themselves and express themselves when their parent hs literally taken care of the situation? And handled it.", "And her Dad should teach her instead of permitting her to leap to \"I hate you\" and \"I don't like you\" at the slightest sign of difficulty.\n\nWhatever he said after she told her cousin \"I hate you\" obviously didn't stick, as she did the same thing with her aunt. \n\nShe's 5, not 2. She should be past the tantrum stage and able to be reasoned with. Smells of jealous sibling with a 1 month old baby in the house acting out and Daddy indulging his princess because he can't be arsed to parent properly, tbh.", "[deleted]", "I think it's just a silly nursery rhyme that shows how casually the expectations of boys and girls are expressed. It's unfortunate for everyone, not just girls.", "You\u2019re the one shaming a child and calling her a bully when even OP hasn\u2019t said anything of the sort. I can\u2019t question one child, but you can totally make up crap about the other child and make her out to be terrible? Way to be a hypocrite.", "What accountability was she supposed to take. I don't like people who throw tantrums because they aren't allowed to yell at me either, and that was a pretty polite way of saying so. Being pregnant isn't an excuse to act like the infant you're carrying.", "Subtlety is an art. And tones can drip venom. People generally have ZERO chill when it comes to their children. ZERO.", "One time I tried to discipline my son and I couldn\u2019t it was so funny and he was so right on that I just laughed into a pillow and said, \u201c well played son well played.\u201d Lol \ud83d\ude02", "Her aunt is not her parent she doesn\u2019t get to discipline her niece for something that was already handled by the parent", "I feel so sorry for any children you have or may have.  \nI can tell you are gonna be one of them parents that think hitting is parenting, that kids should never talk back to adults, and that \"rules for thee and not for me,\" is the way, \"because I'm the parent and I said so.\"", "I taught daycare for years and volunteer in kids organizations. Girls are absolutely raised and treated differently by some parents and some teachers even. There\u2019s comment after comment from women giving examples that absolutely happen frequently, but sure those are all just delusions because it\u2019s never happened to you, a man lol", "I just had a conversation about this. I was brought up in the be polite, people please, hug that person even if you don't want to, era. Even as an adult I have to remind myself that I don't always have to be that way, and if someone makes me uncomfortable or won't leave me alone, nice and polite goes out the window, and that's ok. I'm all for kids, especially girls, not being taught that way!!"]}
