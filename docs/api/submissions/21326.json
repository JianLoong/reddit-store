She never should have insulted your daughter, especially in front of her. Children remember these hurtful remarks. I can understand where your anger/frustration stemmed from. Next time don\u2019t rise to the bait she\u2019s throwing at you. Set a better example for your daughter. \n\nAlso. Children argue. They make statements like \u201cI hate you\u201d. It\u2019s not the end of the world. You addressed the dispute when it arose. SIL should have taken you to one side to voice any concerns she had.", "ESH no wonder your kids talk like that if all the adults don't know how to communicate appropriately (especially in front of the kids)", "People, learn to read. Everyone saying OPs daughter is a brat needs to go back and read it again. None of the children were brats.\n\nOP talked to his daughter and she apologized to her cousin. That should have been the end of it. \n\nBut SIL doubled down and said she should be able to discipline OPs daughter. She made a damn mountain  out of a molehill. OP'S daughter saying \"I don't like you\" was probably her way of saying she was upset by her aunt yelling.", "ESH.  You suck a little more for starting it.  Your daughter said something mean to your niece and even if you addressed it, it\u2019s okay for SIL to say something to her.", "YTA. You should have not only immediately told SIL what your daughter had done, you allowed her to be a brat directly to your SIL. Good for SIL for defending her kid. Nice kid you're raising there. She sounds like an absolute brat. My parents would have put the fear of God into me for speaking so rudely to SIL.", "ESH. What great examples you guys are to your kids. Wow.", "Oh, I've been caught up in these sort of screaming arguments when I was a kid. Caught between ESH with a side of NTA and NTA with a side of ESH.", "NTA but you're not helping your case with your own behavior in front of your kids.", "NTA. Maybe the niece is bullying the daughter. The aunt is mean to the daughter. The daughter has enough self esteem to tell the bullies she doesn't like them. Why is this bad? Why is everyone saying the daughter has behavioral issues?\n\nDad and aunt shouldn't have a screaming match in front of the children. But the families should have a cooling off period and have the gender reveal somewhere else.\n\nThe flying monkeys just don't want to host the gender reveal.", "NTA. Your kid is 5 years old. She does not get to go off on her.\n\nBut you gotta protect your kid better than this. She can't be in a position where she can go off on your kid whenever it comes into her head.", "how does she have behavioral issues? kids saying \"I hate you\" without knowing how deep that phrase cuts is typical for kids because they have yet to learn sympathy and empathy and literally moment like this are for teaching her how it makes people feel.   \n\n\nand saying \"I don't like you\" to an adult who is yelling and stomping and being angry and does this bullshit regularly so she absolutely has seen her aunt do this all her fucking life-is absolutely more than ok and justified. kids are allowed to have and voice opinons and tell you what and who they do and do not like and even set boundaries such as \"I don't want to hug grandma\" and it's not a behavioral issue it's just kids growing and learning to be independent.  \n\n\nand how did dad misbehave? he stood up for his daughter and the most he did was yell and tell sister to fuck right off. I don't even wanna hear about \"swearing in front of children\" because that's a mild offense to make this an everyone sucks situation compared to what sister did", "Did he not say he already spoke to his kid though? I absolutely wouldn't let a stranger shout at my child, and I wouldn't anybody else's.

Op already addressed it with his daughter. That\u2019s it subject closed. She\u2019s 5 and at that age their attention span is in minutes! Coming back hours later to deal out another lecture is pointless. Also at 5 yrs old they know NO filter of being politically polite. They only know that if somebody hurt them or did something wrong to act out with honesty, which she did. What about the fact that by the age of eight SILs should know what a tattletale is, which is what she did. Bottom line sister-in-law, wasn\u2019t there, OP handle the issue and it didn\u2019t need to be re-addressed. OP would never been put into the second situation if sister-in-law\u2018s self entitled mouth had been kept closed, took her kid and left as she should have. She\u2019s the one that re-entered someone else\u2019s house to start crap!", "He had already addressed this with his daughter when the incident happened. This is often most effective than waiting until later, especially with young kids. Both adults were wrong to yell and swear.", "No, no it\u2019s not. The situation was handled and OVER.

Nice try.", "The comment was relevant because everyone is saying how OPs daughter is a brat. OP talked to his daughter about her comment and she apologized to her cousin.  That should have been the end of it. \n\n But SIL thought she should be able to discipline her. And it's not like she told her aunt to fuck off. \"I don't like you\" is a way for them to say they don't like how you're behaving. \n\nAnd this cheeky arsehole has everyone discussing so it's working", "In what twisted world is a child not allowed to have opinions or think for herself?  Teaching children to bottle up how they feel and never speak their opinion out loud is messed up.  \n\nSIL sounds like a shitty person to be around, and OP doesn't seem to like her either why would he discipline his child for voicing what everyone is already thinking?  \n\nThis has the same vibe as the forcing your child to hug/kiss people.  \n\ngood on you OP for sticking up for your girl and showing her you don't have to put up with BS just because your sibling married an asshole.", "Kids say I hate you all the time. Let kids be kids. She apologized to her cousin.  As for what she said to her aunt, why should she apologize? She probably doesn't like her or the fact she was yelling.", "Then you sound like a crap parent. I'm sorry for your kid.", "Who said they couldn't? SIL is definitely a crappy person, but that doesn't excuse disrespectful behaviors.", "Maybe this is a cultural difference then because this would not fly amongst most of my people. Hell, we couldn't even say we hate our siblings and cousins when I was a kid that would get us grounded so fast because hate was like a cuss word.

The little girl apologized to her cousin. \n\nThe comment to the aunt was probably her way of saying \"I dont like your behavior.\" It's not like she told her to fuck off.", "telling someone you don't like them isn't disrespectful.  That's my whole point.  she didn't insult SIL.  \n\nThe initial situation was handled well, it was likely an emotional outburst that wasn't rooted in fact( ie OP's daughter does not actually hate her cousin).\n\nThe daughter was giving honest feedback on the SIL's behavior.  I do think adults should not fight in front of children, but that's a hard thing to maintain when conflicts like this arise. \n\nI would not hold my daughter accountable for telling my (ex)SIL that she doesn't like her(she does).\n\nI guess all that to say we have different opinions on what behaviors are bad/unacceptable", "NTA.\n\nThis SIL is awful. No gender reveal for her, nothing from now on. Your mother and MIL of course are siding with her. Thery have the nerve to ask you to apologize?\n\nTell them to apologize to you for their enmity or you're finished with them till they do. This siding with the aggressor (your SIL) has to stop. \n\nYou are not their doormat.", "NTA, but need to stop any sort of fighting going on near your kids. As soon as she wants to throw a fit, straight out of the house. Don\u2019t reply, show your kids we don\u2019t put up with people like that or stoop down to their level. \n\npossible ESH just for reacting and giving your daughter a horrible example.", "NTA but I would consider apologising to your daughter, niece and sister in law for swearing and explain your position. An adult shouldn\u2019t double down on reprimanding a child (especially a five year old) so i think you were rightfully upset and your daughter\u2019s reaction is normal for her age despite what others are saying because kids don\u2019t have the mental capacity to fully understand what they are saying but since it happened twice it might be worth having a talk to her about it to prevent it from happening again. Since this situation did happen after you were babysitting it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if you decided not to do it anymore imo. As for the baby shower, your mother and mother-in-law sound free so if you and your wife aren\u2019t up to it considering her rude behaviour and lack of an apology they can take it up. But I do think you should be the bigger person and make right what you did wrong by admitting your mistake if not it would mean that you suck too. I understand it was a heated moment but now you should have the hindsight to change a little bit of the outcome and allow it to be a teaching moment for your daughter.", "I don't understand most people here saying stuff like your daughter being difficult or having behavioral issues.\nWhen my stepdaughter was 5 y/o she wanted candy and I said no, she then screamed at me that I was the worst human alive and that she hated me and told me to go and die and the stormed of to her bedroom. About an hour later she came down to the living room, crying because she felt guilty and apologized and we talked about our feelings and all was good again. However she said it again a couple of years later, when I said told her no, she could not have a sleepover at our house since I was pregnant and in danger of giving birth prematurely, and she apologized again. \nMy point is, children say a lot of things they don't mean because children have no filters and don't know how to regulate their feelings properly. And you are not supposed to yell at them for it, you are supposed to talk to them about it and explain the words and feelings.\n\nNTA by the way.", "Nta stop engaging with her. That blow out should have never happened. Take 6 months and give yourself some space, go low contact", "NTA.  Only read the title.", "Y'all all sound like you have just lovely communication. Just lovely. \nThat said 5yos say mean but true things. It's who they are. You talked to her and that should have been the end of it.  8 yos get butt hurt about any social slight. That's also a truth of their age. The PROBLEM sounds like sil, and I'd just hold form and not do her anymore favors personally. \nEsh for the adult bs going on.", "NTA. I also don't like your sister in law.", "I think my issue is that the conversation he had with his daughter didn't make any difference since she was very quick to immediately say something nasty to her aunt. We also don't know what he did to \"handle\" the issue.", "Saying \" x i don't like you\" is not a sign of behavioral issues bffr. \n\nMy 4yo told me she is not my friend today because i didn't let her eat a popsicle for breakfast. Its a phase many kids go through. \n\nOp im gonna say esh simply for having this in front of the children.", "The kid is five. I said 'i hate you' as soon as I learned how until my grandfather sat me down and told me that you can't take words back.\n\nKids don't have critical thinking skills or context for emotional distress. At five, she barely knows how to add numbers together.", "Here we go, another Reddit armchair psychologist...", "behavioural issues? For expressing her feelings, as a 5yo?", "She\u2019s 5\u2026..", "He made her apologize, how is that not accountability? He just wasn't going to let a grown woman take her anger out on a kid. This had nothing to do with discipline, she was just mad she said that to her daughter. If it was about discipline then what OP did should have been enough.", "I don't like you isn't nasty. With all the fuck bombs flying around she could have told her to fuck off. \n\nThe little girl is 5. It's going to take more reprimands (talks) for her to get it.", "How is \u201cI don\u2019t like you\u201d nasty? She expressed her feelings after being scolded and witnessing a yelling match between her aunt and her father.", "I don't know. After what I read, I agree with the 5 year old. I don't like Sister in Law.", "Did I ever say it was right for SIL to readdress the situation? I didn't. Hence the ESH. I never had a problem with what OP initially did, it's the second part.", "What insult?", "I agree. I think everyone sucks here.", "But the daughter didn\u2019t misbehave in front of sil. She was told about it later. Which by your logic the family member present handled it. So why would another need to pilling especially when it is not the parent child?", "And the second part ONLY happened due to SIL opening her mouth the first. OP was only antagonized a second time when sister-in-law re-entered his home without permission and started again on the issue.. OP was at no time combative until sister-in-law started her crap the second time. OP was only defending himself and his child.", "She said, \"I don't like you.\" That's disrespectful? Wow.\nShe was probably voicing that she didn't like her aunt's behavior.", "No you just you and sil. She is 5. She expressed her emotions exactly as she should. Better than most adults clearly. If you think for one second after how she acted the little girl isn\u2019t gonna say that you\u2019re wrong.

Nothing cringey about that.", "Says the person making ad hominem attacks because they don't like what the other is saying lol", "I understand where you're coming from. I see it now, I was looking at it from an adults perspective more than that of a child.
