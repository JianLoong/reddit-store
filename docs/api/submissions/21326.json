They only know that if somebody hurt them or did something wrong to act out with honesty, which she did. What about the fact that by the age of eight SILs should know what a tattletale is, which is what she did.

That should have been the end of it. \n\n But SIL thought she should be able to discipline her.

Teaching children to bottle up how they feel and never speak their opinion out loud is messed up.  \n\nSIL sounds like a shitty person to be around, and OP doesn't seem to like her either why would he discipline his child for voicing what everyone is already thinking?  \n\nThis has the same vibe as the forcing your child to hug/kiss people.  \n\ngood on you OP for sticking up for your girl and showing her you don't have to put up with BS just because your sibling married an asshole.", "Kids say I hate you all the time.

SIL is definitely a crappy person, but that doesn't excuse disrespectful behaviors.", "Maybe this is a cultural difference then because this would not fly amongst most of my people.

That's my whole point.  she didn't insult SIL.  \n\nThe initial situation was handled well, it was likely an emotional outburst that wasn't rooted in fact( ie OP's daughter does not actually hate her cousin).\n\nThe daughter was giving honest feedback on the SIL's behavior.  I do think adults should not fight in front of children, but that's a hard thing to maintain when conflicts like this arise. \n\nI would not hold my daughter accountable for telling my (ex)SIL that she doesn't like her(she does).\n\nI guess all that to say we have different opinions on what behaviors are bad/unacceptable", "NTA.\n\nThis SIL is awful. No gender reveal for her, nothing from now on. Your mother and MIL of course are siding with her.

An adult shouldn\u2019t double down on reprimanding a child (especially a five year old) so i think you were rightfully upset and your daughter\u2019s reaction is normal for her age despite what others are saying because kids don\u2019t have the mental capacity to fully understand what they are saying but since it happened twice it might be worth having a talk to her about it to prevent it from happening again. Since this situation did happen after you were babysitting it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if you decided not to do it anymore imo. As for the baby shower, your mother and mother-in-law sound free so if you and your wife aren\u2019t up to it considering her rude behaviour and lack of an apology they can take it up. But I do think you should be the bigger person and make right what you did wrong by admitting your mistake if not it would mean that you suck too. I understand it was a heated moment but now you should have the hindsight to change a little bit of the outcome and allow it to be a teaching moment for your daughter.", "I don't understand most people here saying stuff like your daughter being difficult or having behavioral issues.\nWhen my stepdaughter was 5 y/o she wanted candy and I said no, she then screamed at me that I was the worst human alive and that she hated me and told me to go and die and the stormed of to her bedroom. About an hour later she came down to the living room, crying because she felt guilty and apologized and we talked about our feelings and all was good again. However she said it again a couple of years later, when I said told her no, she could not have a sleepover at our house since I was pregnant and in danger of giving birth prematurely, and she apologized again. \nMy point is, children say a lot of things they don't mean because children have no filters and don't know how to regulate their feelings properly. And you are not supposed to yell at them for it, you are supposed to talk to them about it and explain the words and feelings.\n\nNTA by the way.", "Nta stop engaging with her. That blow out should have never happened. Take 6 months and give yourself some space, go low contact", "NTA.  Only read the title.", "Y'all all sound like you have just lovely communication. Just lovely. \nThat said 5yos say mean but true things. It's who they are. You talked to her and that should have been the end of it.  8 yos get butt hurt about any social slight. That's also a truth of their age. The PROBLEM sounds like sil, and I'd just hold form and not do her anymore favors personally. \nEsh for the adult bs going on.", "NTA. I also don't like your sister in law.", "I think my issue is that the conversation he had with his daughter didn't make any difference since she was very quick to immediately say something nasty to her aunt. We also don't know what he did to \"handle\" the issue.", "Saying \" x i don't like you\" is not a sign of behavioral issues bffr. \n\nMy 4yo told me she is not my friend today because i didn't let her eat a popsicle for breakfast.

So why would another need to pilling especially when it is not the parent child?", "And the second part ONLY happened due to SIL opening her mouth the first.

The difference in price of the two dishes was almost 10 buck and the bill was over 300. I deducted 39 dollars which was the actual cost of the beef dish and then paid my split and told her that I was doing this. \n\nAs for my SIL I only treat her exactly how she treats me at the moment because her attitude changes every time I see her.", "NTA: It seems like your daughter has a better grasp on how to handle her feelings than your SiL.

She is 5 and it needed addressed at the time as you did not after the fact again by SIL. SIL should not have come back in she knew it was a hot mess already so she was out of line.

Yelling and telling each other to F off and I got a feeling you may have mumbled something like god I hate the B. I would have. Any way you were both out of line. Don\u2019t babysit for her anymore.

Your response to her comment you can\u2019d say anything to her kids should have been:  GREAT!  I\u2019ll not be watching them ever again.   And then invited her to leave.\n\nNope, no gender reveal at your house.", "I need more info.  What happened that your daughter told her cousin she hates her?   Five year olds usually don't randomly come out with that sort of thing unless cousin has done something to her.  \n\n I had a job with kids age 5-11.  Part of my duties was to supervise early morning play time outside when the kids finished breakfast before they went to class.  I learned that the one who tattles is often the instigator.  When a kid says \"X did this to me\" I look at X and say \"What did they do to you to make you want to do that?\"  Usually the person tattling had been aggravating X.\n\nAre you making your daughter apologize to someone who is bullying her?", "NTA. I'd double down on gender reveal party. SIL wants one from you SHE can apologize. Your kid doesn't need to be told twice that what she did was wrong, least of all by someone who isn't raising her.", "NTA. Kids say weird things they don't mean all the time. Your SIL is supposed to be an adult. Her reaction was wrong. Your Mother and MIL are excusing her behavior, probably happens every time she acts like that. I wouldn't apologize unless she does so over yelling at your daughter. I would also never watch your niece again. Not your monkeys, not your circus.", "NTA. I feel bad for the kids in this situation, though. I\u2019ve seen in-laws fight and for them it can be very hard to process.

I\u2019m with you - the daughter used her words.", "I find it ironic since the adults in this situation essentially did the same thing as the child here, telling each other to fuck off instead of having a conversation about what\u2019s frustrating them.

Former elementary teacher here. The five year old daughter saying \"I hate you\" to her cousin is *NOT* indicative of behavioral problems. It's well within the range of expected behavior for a five year old. Kids make mistakes. \n\n\nOP addressed the issue and had his daughter apologize. That's a completely appropriate response to that type of problem. The SIL was out of line for demanding additional punishment. \n\n\nI agree with the 5 year old.
