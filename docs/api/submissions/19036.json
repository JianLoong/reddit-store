You are the problem in this situation and I wonder how you treat her in the home.", "YTA. Laura is legally your girlfriend's child, so if you consider your girlfriend family, Laura it too. Who were you planning on leaving Laura with? And what do you mean your parents are excited to meet their first grandchild when you have two and the oldest is 5?", "This is a joke, right? \n\nYour gf has raised Laura for the past 9 years, since Laura was 5 years old. Sounds like you gf is effectively her parent. \n\nThe only way you would not be the AH, is if Laura no longer lives with you/your gf. There is too much info missing, but if the 12 year old is still living with you, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your stance has made your gf see you in a new, unfavourable light. Kinda heartbreaking for both the gf and the kid. \n\nYTA", "YTA because your family has three kids. Just because you didn\u2019t father all 3 doesn\u2019t change that. The fact that your GF has to mother her sister means there is some tough history there. This girl should not be set apart period.", "Yta \n\nThe moment you knew about her sister and her having custody you agreed to become a surrogate parent to her as well. She's just as much your child as your own flesh and blood because you are raising her. Have helped raise her. \n\nBy excluding your saying this isn't true, that she'd just someone who simply in life because you have to tolerate because your gf have custody. When you are the full time career for any child they should be treated equally", "YTA For all the reasons other people have said, and for your little \"excluding\" in quotations in the title. You're excluding her. Own up to what you're doing.", "YTA. \nWhen you accepted your GF into your life and had a family with her, you also accepted her sister who she has full custody of and is basically the mother to. Excluding her is no different than excluding one of her biological children. Imagine how Laura would feel. If you choose to go through with this, there will be detrimental consequences and a divide of your family unit. They are a package deal and I\u2019m pretty sure you were well aware of that before you started a family with your gf. It would be a heartless move to exclude her, especially now.", "YTA.  Or more accurately, YTBFAOTP.  I can't believe you even have to ask.  I bet your girlfriend is questioning your entire relationship right now.  Wondering how you have managed to hide your callous and cruel nature from her until now.  Thinking back about red flags that she ignored or just missed. Everything she thought she knew about you is now in doubt.", "#Laura is your stepdaughter....not your girlfriend's sister\n\nShe was your girlfriend's child when you met her....thus making her your step child\n\nYou are literally excluding your step daughter from family time\n\nIn what universe is that ok?\n\nEven your parents can see what you are doing is wrong. \n\nI mean, you still call Laura your girlfriend's sister....because it makes it easier for you to exclude her\n\nSHE IS YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S DAUGHTER.\n\nShe took legal guardianship of a minor child and is raising that child as her own.\n\nIn every sense of the word, this child is her daughter.\n\nAnd since you are dating her and started a family with her...that makes her your child as well\n\nSo if that is not what you signed up for, then cut your girlfriend loose and raise your kids separately.\n\nBecause from this moment on, you can either accept your mistake and start treating Laura as your child...or you can watch as your family implodes around you and you lose everything\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou've been this kid's parental figure since she was 5 years old and you don't get why it's hurtful that you would exclude her? And since your parents are also upset with you, this is 100% a YOU problem.", "YTA.\n\nEveryone, *including your parents*, see Laura as your child. \n\nEveryone except you.\n\nYou either accept you are a parental figure to this young girl or you leave and accept the consequences. \n\nWhat you don\u2019t do is continue with the mindset that a child you\u2019ve raised for most of her life and will continue to raise isn\u2019t family. You don\u2019t continue to be a father figure in her life and then treat her differently from the other children who call you father.\n\nSeek therapy, search your heart, do whatever you need to do. But do it now.", "YTA. I think the issue is: you don\u2019t realise you have 3 children, not 2. Laura is only 12 years old, and your gf has raised her for 9 years - regardless of their actually biology, Laura is functionally her eldest child. You have been in Laura\u2019s life for the last 7 years. \n\nEveryone, including your parents, clearly sees you as a second parent figure to Laura. They clearly think of her as family too. They may even think of *her* as akin to their first grandchild. It\u2019s no doubt a blow to everyone to find out, after all this time, that in fact you don\u2019t see Laura as equal to your children and in fact may have never loved her the same. It sounds to me like a lot of people are pretty disappointed in you.\n\nI suggest you start thinking of Laura as either your stepdaughter or your adopted daughter as opposed to \u201cyour gf\u2019s sister\u201d because that\u2019s what she is to you functionally. Consider whether it would be appropriate to exclude an adopted child from a trip while taking only your biological children, then you\u2019ll gain an better understanding of why people are upset.", "YTA. Father/kid time now includes your wife\u2019s sister. Even your own parents agree. Your wife is now the mother figure of this 12 year old girl, she\u2019s not just a sister in law because this is a different circumstance. When you and your wife decided to start a family, this family now includes her little sister as your daughter figure. It\u2019s not hard to learn how to love a child. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be excluded and her feelings matter too. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sure your parents would be ecstatic meeting their grandkids and spending time with the whole family, but at the same time I think your parents would love to meet the ENTIRE family.

Laura is part of the family. It breaks my heart how you want to leave a 12 yo kid behind for an entire trip.", "So your girlfriend basically raised a little girl since she was 3yo and you met here, when her legal daughter was 5yo. I guess you raised her together after a bit of time. So, i'm guessing, for at least 5 years this girl has been your step daughter, since you had your first child five years ago. And you don't consider her your step-child at least?\n\nYTA and a big one too. Way of telling your girlfriend and her daughter, that you only care about your biological children.\n\nImagine being raised by someone since you are 5 years old and then, when your in puberty, recognizing thos person doesn't even love you enough, to spend time with you AND his bio kids. Must be cruel to her!", "YTA. Laura is your family too, OP. You girlfriend and her minor sister are a package deal.", "Info: Why are you the only one who wants to exclude Laura? Your parents want her to go, and since they are the ones you're visiting, why do they not get a say?", "Doesn't your girlfriend understand that you want to spend time with just your \"real\" children? Why should it matter that some random child who isn't blood related to you would be devastated to be left out on a trip with a parental figure in her life? YTA", "YTA\n\nLaura is as much of your gfs life as your kids are to her. You got into a relationship with your partner accepting every part of her life but only when it suits you it seems. Also what are you expecting Laura to do while you are gone, and how do you think she will feel when her guardians are away with their \"family\". It will make her not feel like a part of it.", "YTA\n\ndon't date someone, let alone have children with someone that has sole custody of a child, if you are not on board having that child being part of the family, which means being included in family trips. \n\nSeems your parents are more open armed to welcome a child in the family than you are.", "YTA.

Those are the ones you select.\u201d  Hector Xtravaganza.\n\nWether you meant to or not, your ugly is showing.  Fix it before you irreparably damage your relationship with her and your gf.", "YTA. \n\nShe\u2019s raising her sister and you accepted that when you got together with her. It\u2019s like excluding a step kid. \n\nWhen you have a blended family, you don\u2019t get to exclude one kid from the trip. You can spend \u201calone time\u201d with your kids by taking them on dad/child dates.", "YTA. Even your parents have better understanding than you.", "Do your bio kids feel that they don't have enough of your undivided attention? If they feel 'it is all about laura'  I can see why you might want to split the family. But I can't see any other reason to deny Laura the opportunity for such an interesting trip.", "I understand that she's your GF and not your wife, but does her sister look at you as a father? Do you play the father role in her life? If the sister didn't want to go, that's one thing. To exclude her, that's completely different.", "YTA\n\n\nYou are like the anti-Brady Bunch", "it sounds like her sister lives with you, therefore YTA as any normal person would consider her equally with their kids", "YTA. If your parents aren't happy with excluding Laura then why exclude her? They probably want grandparent/grandkid time with her as well. It's mindboggling to me how you don't see her as your own child at this point.", "YTA you have been a part of Laura\u2019s life for 7 years. She may not be your biological child but she is a child in your family. Laura now knows you see her differently than the other kids in the family. \n\nIt really sounds like this trip is designed for you yo be with your bio children because you don\u2019t accept Laura as a really part of your family. \n\nYour two points to the trip were bonding with your kids and them meeting your parents. You should be bonding with your kids everyday.

I have had custody of my nephew for 10 years now, if my husband ever excluded him from something like that, it would be the end of us. \n\nBut, luckily my husband is not an AH and would never in a million years dream of excluding a child from something while taking other children and showing clear favoritism.", "YTA\n\nYour GF has  full custody of Laura.

She should not tolerate being treated that way.", "YTA.\n\n\nYour girlfriend's sister is in her custody, so she is more like her daughter than anything else.

It's a move that very clearly shows what you think of her.\n\nI'd think very carefully about whether you really want to send that message.

That means your GF is her mother.  You've already said the other kids are with her p so you are basically excluding one ofc her three children.  And obviously if the sister has custody something bad happened.  That's just was what the little girl needs in life, to be rejected by the only possible father figure she might have.  You lack empath and compassion.", "I'm gonna say NTA, but YTA because this is her sibling, and she's solely responsible for her unless you adopt her. There are liability reasons behind this.

But if your gf make Laura think of her as a mom, she\u2019ll see you as a dad and it might hurt her feelings to be excluded.", "NAH - BUT you should have had the conversation before making the plan. What you want from the trip is valid, but you failed to consider the other side. If'd you have talked with your GF before making the plan, you could have asked Laura what she wanted to do.

You would love your little sister or little brother, raise them, but your children would feel different, right?\n\nOP does love the child. But it's a different sort of love.

Older kids parent their younger siblings a lot, doesn't mean they are same as own child. \n\nAnd it's not a stepdaughter scenario either. It doesn't feel that way. It's how you view stuff, I guess.

You could extend an invitation to the GFs sister seeing as she is still family and still young, and would maybe appreciate the chance to spend time with you (without her sister), and with your kids, but wanting time with your kids doesn\u2019t make you an ass.

Your gf can decide if she will accept that for Laura or not, but she also cannot just force you to be Laura's dad. NAH I guess. Poor Laura.

You've been dating your gf for SEVEN years, and she's been raising her sister for NINE years - since Laura was THREE years old. For Laura, your gf IS her mom. You've been Laura's dad figure for the past 7 years. Your gf and you have 2 children together and parent all 3 children, essentially as siblings. No matter how you slice it, Laura is going to feel 'less than' be being considered separate from your kids (in her mind, her siblings). That is why you are getting so many y-t-a votes.\n2. You were looking for a visit (grand)parent visit - even without your gf. For me, this tells me that you were looking for your visit to really be about you having time with your parents and your kids having time with their grandparents. I think that softens things. However, I think you missed a few key points.\n3. You and your gf and children form a family. Laura sees you as her dad; Your gf sees you as the dad of ALL of her children. Your own parents see Laura as one of your kids. If you are going to be a family with your gf for the long haul, then you need to embrace Laura as one of you children. You should have included Laura in the trip - even if your gf stayed home. It would be you and your kids having time with your parents while your gf (/wife) stayed home.\n\nI hope that helps you see things in a more clear light.", "Why is she not your wife yet?

Tell your girlfriend you don\u2019t love her and aren\u2019t committed to her to save her some god damn time. I\u2019ve seen you commet this on like every single thread, touch grass and get a hobby.", "I don\u2019t think you understand how human relationships work. Or you\u2019re OP\u2019s alt account.", "Laura not being his child is a fact. He's not an asshole. \"Considered Laura his family\" bs, at most Laura is the aunt of his kids and his girlfriend's sister to him.\n\nHow does that translate in relation to grandparents spending time with their grandchildren and two kids spending time with their dad? They aren't married or related. It's not even appropriate for him to take her overnight as he is not her legal guardian.  It's a trip for grandparents/grandchildren which Laura just isn't. Be mad all you want but facts are facts. They have children together but still make the choice to not be married. Hence, only his own children are his own. Laura is the gf's child. Other commentary doesn't change these real statuses.", "This cracks me up...\n\nwhen my eldest was about 2, we changed the doorknob on the back door from a round knob to a lever style one so he could open it himself...  we live in the old part of town, in a small city, but are lucky enough to have a bit of the side yard fenced where he had a sand box and toys, and I could see him from the living room if he was out there.\n\nHe would wander out and back while playing and wanting different toys, so I figured having him open the door himself just expedited things!  He would have totally loved a doggy-style door even more though!", "Literally my dad did this when he built a fence high enough so he couldn't see my mom's house (when they divorced she moved next door to be close to us) and he installed a child size gate so only kids could get between the houses. As you can see, my dad has severe control issues and is generally an asshole.", "AITA loves a good, snappy retort, they don't like the complicated reality that even with situations are bleak, they're still work working on before you completely give up.\n\nEven if there weren't young children involved (and I'm not saying, stay together for the children, but I am saying, don't abruptly uproot their whole lives when it can be done more calmly with talking and front loading their expectations...) you can't just change the locks on a shared house in most jurisdictions.  There would need to be notice given, etc, unless it was a situation with physical abuse.  Not ideal, but thems the laws.", "\u2026. her children can come back in the home lol figured that was obvious haha", "Normally I\u2019d agree with you, but once you raise a child since age 3, the definition of parent and sibling completely changes for that child. He has admitted he fills a fatherly role in her life and has for many years (comments). To her, he is as close to a father as she ever has had and ever will have. Then now to suddenly have that changed because he has bio kids? \n\nLook, to be completely blunt I hope they have consulted child psychologists/therapists in all of this but more often than not the child will look to these adults as \u201cparents\u201d and not \u201csiblings\u201d. \n\nAlso quite frankly? If he just said I\u2019m gunna take the younger two to see my folks I\u2019ll leave Laura will you to make it easier I doubt there would even be an issue. The bio kids only thing is just super heartless after like ~9 years of raising the girl.", "Cute uwu", "Months is a bit crazy if they\u2019re less than an hour away, that\u2019s practically the same city. Anything could happen any day, you never know. Once a month is my minimum.", "That's because traffic.  Like, I like 45 minutes away from Orlando, but during times I would be driving it if I was dating somewhere there, it would be 2 hours minimum - and there's not a lot of public transportation options.  Although I adjust my language to say 2 hours in traffic.", "It really isn\u2019t, my mum lives more in the north of England\u2026. It\u2019s a 14 hour trip with ferry and rest stops\u2026. I\u2019m not doing that with a 3 year old. \n\nAnd screw flying with a 3 year old\u2026 once he\u2019s 4 and actually sort of listens, then it will be ok. \n\nMy mum just keeps making excuses about her boyfriend\u2019s work schedule", "London to Amsterdam, yes. I did Middlesbrough to Eindhoven to visit friends last year - with connections, waiting times etc - took me 13.5 hours in total.", "Because people lives other places than London or Amsterdam. To get to London alone from my house on the train it would take me 3.5 hours. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible - just not a joy and also would break the bloody bank given UK rail costs.", "I\u2019m i mean, I\u2019m not disagreeing - i just found the suggestion of train odd.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing - I\u2019m just pointing out that a train (as the commenter above me I was replying to) would not be ideal.", "It sounds like he doesn\u2019t want his parents to bond with Laura, even though they do.", "Yeah if it was like \u201cmy parents are going to treat her differently and refuse to change\u201d I\u2019d say of course don\u2019t bring her (to protect her not to make things easier for OP) but clearly the parents want her there too.", "I agree.\n\nI can\u2019t believe he was a part of her babyhood and still sees her as other.", "35 is a bit extreme because by then even bio kids are seperate from their parents but even if Laura was 18 she would still be the girlfriends daughter because that\u2019s the person who raised her. And because Laura is the girlfriends daughter, she would still be his bio kids sibling. The only difference is that Laura might be independent enough that she might move out or something", "why wouldn\u2019t it be appropriate for him to take a member of his household, for whom he is responsible when he is the only adult at home, on an overnight trip? that makes no sense. \n\nat the very least, laura is his GF\u2019s adopted daughter and bio aunt to his children. AKA, Laura is being raised as the children\u2019s sibling AND is related by blood to them. the fact is, MANY people would consider them to be family (including OP\u2019s parents and GF) and OP is making an asshole choice to reject laura. Marriage doesn\u2019t make a family, the daily choice to be a part of one does.", "My granny had a stable-type back door (i.e. Two separate doors, one on top of the other). Unfortunately I'm pretty sure it was built so you couldn't open the bottom door without the top door being open, partly because I don't have memories of running underneath it as a child, but I imagine that would be so fun for kids to have their own door.", "It sounds magical with a special door just for the kids to roam through during childhood. Less magical with the specific that led up to it though....", "2 hours round trip isnt even that bad either. Buncha softies down there.", "You can drive there in 9 hours\u2026", "I don't understand why everyone is giving you shit lmao. Some people are just busy, it's inconvenient to travel, it's impractical, etc. Some people don't have passports, can't leave people they're caring for, blah blah blah. \n\nNobody gives the benefit of the doubt these days.", "If you have a car. And a driving licence.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing - I\u2019m just pointing out that a train (as the commenter above me I was replying to) would not be ideal.", "They are probably Americans who think UK = London and Netherlands = Amsterdam\u2026\n\nAnyway, you could also drive to Norwich (4h) and catch a flight there to Amsterdam, which is barely 30\u2019 flight time. Or, the ferry from Harwich\u2026 it\u2019s more hours, but at least you can sleep for 8 of them!", "Hah probably. I\u2019ve done UK to Netherlands several times - car + ferry, train & plane. It can take as long as you want it to take. But it was just the commenter saying train, with its connections/waiting times etc, just seems an odd suggestion when there\u2019s a toddler involved aha."]}
