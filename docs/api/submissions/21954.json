I think there's too much info left out. It sounds like dad works professionally in property management/rental and has said the property is only worth $800/moth. Just because it's a 1bd/1ba does not make it a direct comp to the apartments. What's the age of the house? What are the ages of the apartments? What's the overall neighborhood around the house like? What are the neighborhoods the apartments are in like? A property management company is out to make money, so if this one (or his dad on behalf of this one) is saying, \"Your property is only worth $800 a month.\" then the property is probably only worth $800 a month. I mean, the OP said he did all the work himself -- I get it, I do a lot of the work at our home and business myself.

But if it's just the difference of $800 vs $1300, that could just be a more conservative estimate from your dad versus your opinion.
