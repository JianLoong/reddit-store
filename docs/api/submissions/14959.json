I don\u2019t think that necessarily makes somebody a \u201cmoron\u201d, especially someone who was an icon for the people you\u2019re talking to. It was more of an ego problem with so much money and fame coming at such a young age. Also, Living in a certain area doesn\u2019t mean you understand the problems that marginalized communities face.

And yes, because despite the fact that he came from a shitty area, he refuses to recognize that being white does afford SOME privilege in climbing out of a hole.  If his argument is that Tupac was a poseur because he didn't come from that kind of background and was rapping about it like it was awesome, without ever experiencing it, then your husband is not an asshole.  If Tupac DID come from that kind of background, your husband is an asshole.  He doesn't get to negate someone else's life experience because he views it differently. \n\nThe stepfather is obviously an asshole for being racist.    The fact that your husband is white, ALSO doesn't negate his experience of growing up in Compton, and his opinions on it.
