Then i said that i wouldn\u2019t want him telling his sisters if i got an epidural or had tearing or anything like that. I prefer to keep it private and i know women can be judgy. He said if it involves his child and the birth he can say whatever he wants. I said that if it has to do with just the hypothetical baby that\u2019s fine but my personal details do not need to be shared with others. He got annoyed and said he was going to bed. I didn\u2019t want to end on a bad note so i tried to finish the conversation and he said \u201cplease stop talking\u201d i found this really rude.

Why do you think so little of yourself that you would allow someone to tell you to stop talking, and then you would stop talking? Are you an obedient pet? Does your boyfriend own you? Did he purchase you from somewhere, and therefore you have to obey him? \n\nIf he is bankrolling you, then I guess he gets to talk to you like that, I might put up with that kind of treatment if he is paying my rent. Other than that, any man who tells me to stop talking is for the streets. I literally do not understand how women put up with that treatment for one second and then ask internet strangers if they are the ones to blame for the terrible men that they are dating. \n\nWhy would you accept this treatment? My therapist tells me I can't fix everybody but I feel like I need to fix women who accept this kind of treatment from garbage men. I can't help it. It makes me so sad.", "NTA.\nHowever reflect on the life you will have with this guy.\nFrom what you said , he compared your opinion about childbirth to his sister's.\nEverything else you do or say might be compared to his sister's. He shows he does not care about your boundaries. \n\nIn the future when, for example, you are buying things for your new house. (Hypothetical) \nHe will say \" I do not want us to buy this sofa.

Your bf should probably learn a bit about communication and personal privacy. If _you_ have a tear that's medical information pertaining to _you_ and he doesn't get to disclose that. If there's an issue with the baby he's the father if he gets an equal saying in whatever is communicated regarding the baby. Passive aggressive going to bed also sucks.", "NTA. It's very much your own private business and if you want to keep it to yourself he should respect that. \n\nI'm sure your bf wouldn't be happy if you told your family without consent how his low sperm count meant you had to get IVF and how it took him 2 days to even get a sample into a cup. Or about how his genital warts made the whole process much more difficult.", "Sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to be invitees into the delivery room or given any medical information to me. At least that way you know your private info remains private.", "NTA. Break up with him RIGHT NOW. He doesnt care about your emotions and this problem will get worse with time. Get out now!", "NTA. Your personal medical information should never be a topic of conversation unless you bring it up. If he tells them this, what else is he telling them? And who else? If you don't establish this boundary it will be hard to correct later. \n\nI've gone low contact with some family because I ran into their acquaintances who asked incredibly personal questions when they should not have that information.", " You are no longer planning on breeding with this person, are you?", "Nta", "NTA. It is YOUR birth journey. Babies arrival or health does not need to include if your vagina tore or if you were medicated ect. If he cannot respect you in this way he cannot properly support you during labour.", "NTA. I'm getting controlling vibes over here... I don't want to imagine what it's like when you're pregnant.", "NTA and has your BF herd of HIPAA. Generally speaking you can get in trouble disclosing other peoples private medical information. This folks is one reason not to have your man in the delivery room. And I think you need to chat with him about his role as a father and your role as a mother. If he can't respect your wishes honestly you should think about not having a future with him.", "Your BF is so sweet; \n\n>He said if it involves his child and the birth he can say whatever he wants.\n\n>he said \u201cplease stop talking\u201d\n\nWhat a wonderful way of speaking to your partner. \n\nBut in all seriousness of course NTA, this guy is a piece of work and if he really thinks or speaks like this, you should reassess the relationship.", "NTA. He\u2019s giving off vibes, does he always dismiss you like this?", "NTA -- But know that if you have a baby with this guy, your details \\*will\\* be shared.  You have the option to get out now if you're not okay with that happening.  If you stay and are upset later after you have been warned, you will be the asshole then.  He's showing you who he is, he won't change.  Decide if you can live with that or not.", "Do not have children with this man.  Do not marry this man.  Give a lot of thought to continuing a relationship with someone so dismissive of you, your health, your privacy, and your body as this man.\n\nEdit--judgement: NTA, and run, OP, run like the wind.", "NTA. He\u2019s your partner. He\u2019s supposed to keep your secrets - especially from his own family if you need it. There shouldn\u2019t even be any question, he should just immediately agree. He\u2019s an asshole.", "This", "Have you heard of HIPAA? It only applies to medical professionals. It's definitely not going to get some guy in trouble legally for talking to his family about his gf. It's just an annoying thing to do.", "This", "Yup. Is if it's illegal for medical staff to dish out private information what makes him think it's okay for him to do it. Furthermore unless she gives the ok to medical staff he is not privy to know any of that information. Be it things happen in the delivery room that probably means he won't be in there. GF might think to have a trusted emergency contact that isn't him if she decides to stay with him. That way they know and he never knows.", "Thats not how it works....", "Ok, let me make this simpler. A persons personal medical information is part of protected private information. HIPAA is put in place so medical practice's do not air private information and that it should never disclosed without permission. Just because he's her BF not a company does not make her information any less private. It's between her and her medical staff not up to him to decide if her private medical information gets out. It is also her choice to request that medical staff leave him out of discussions of medical care/procedures. Because again, despite him being a person not a business, her medical information is up to her to decide if it gets out because private information is protected in one way or another."]}
