This is not so.", "Would this be one way to fix this?  If you get pregnant, make sure he's nowhere around when you''re giving birth, and don't give the medical team authority to share any details with him about *you*.\n\nThen he won't know what happened to your body, unless you tell him.\n\nOh, and NTA.", "NTA, and I would seriously contemplating leaving this relationship as your BF has no boundaries & feels entitled to not respecting any of your boundaries either. A child with this dude would be a nightmare.", "NTA\n\nAsk him: If in the future, he should suffer from erectile dysfunction, since it would be affecting YOUR sex life as well, if he\u2019d be just as comfortable  if you shared that with your family and your friends?\n\nPrivate medical things are just that. Private. He should be respecting your wishes and your privacy here.", "NTA and \ud83d\udea9. Your partner should always respect your wish for privacy unless you're a risk to yourself or others.", "NTA and it\u2019s a good thing you aren\u2019t pregnant with this man! Go find someone who respects you.", "I guess you know where you stand with him. I doubt it will change if you get married. It doesn't look like he'd make you the priority over his family. NTA", "Nta. Run.", "NTA. I bet that he wouldn\u2019t be happy if you saying you think you may have an ingrown hair in your armpit turned into \u201cbut it\u2019s not that bad, BF had one that turned into a giant cyst on his nutsack\u201d. If he argues, well, it\u2019s about their family member and your SO! You can tell what you want!", "NTA. DTMFA! He is selfish and treats you w no respect.", "Sounds like your guy just made a fantastic case for him not being in the delivery room should you get pregnant. This dude doesn't seem like father or marriage material. He obviously doesn't value your privacy or opinion.", "He\u2019s telling you right upfront what his priorities are. Him telling his sisters about your delivery is more important to him than your preferences about it. It\u2019s *his* child, he\u2019s going to do and say whatever he wants, and fuck you if you don\u2019t like it. Sounds like a winner. NTA", "NTA \nIf it turns out conceiving is not that easy, and it turns out that it's his swimmers that aren't doing the swimming,  he would really like you to tell everyone in your family that you're 'trying', but his seed just isn't right? \nI mean.... it involves your future baby, so he would find that perfect dinner conversation with his inlaws, right?? Right????", "NTA. It\u2019s your body, your motherhood experience, it matters only to you! Your boyfriend needs to grow up.", "NTA. I would think long and hard about the relationship and the way he responded when you made a reasonable boundary .", "NTA. I would be furious if my partner shared private medical information with anyone. The fact that he couldn't continue the conversation with you without acting like a child himself means he's not ready for kids anyways. If you get pregnant by him, I wouldn't let him in the room with you if you feel like he won't honor your wishes.", "NTA.\n\nThis is *your* private medical information, not your bf's. He can tell people about the baby but **not** about your birthing experience unless you specifically okay it. \n\nWhy are you considering having a child with a guy who has so little respect for you?", "NTA.\n\nHis family is going to know **everything** on the grounds that he can talk about anything that affects him.  He has no sense of privacy within a relationship.  That's going to include any arguments you have, private health issues, the works.  Mull that over a while before deciding if you want to proceed.", "NTA, if you wish to keep it secret he should keep quiet.", "NTA. What happens to you when you give birth is your business to tell and yours only. Childbirth is hell. If anyone gets to tell the story of it, it\u2019s the person who did it. I had a traumatic birth experience with both my kids and while it may have been hard for my husband to watch, that was MY experience to share.", "Short answer is that this isn\u2019t a man you want to have kids with. There\u2019s lots of negotiation and feelings around child birth on both parents but any answer besides \u201cdon\u2019t worry honey, I will make sure you are feeling safe and taken care of\u201d is something I\u2019m not interested in \n\nBe PICKY about who you have children with. Because you will be at the most vulnerable in your entire life and you need to trust your husband or boyfriend with your life also.", "Nope. He just gave you a hint of how selfish he is. It will get worse. Find someone who cares so much about you, that he'd insist on doing anything to please you. \nHint, full brain growth isn't achieved until @ age 25. Suggest strongly you wait until at least then to get serious about a guy, and he should be closer to 30, on average.\n\nFather of 5 girls and one son.", "Probably the best worded response", "I want to know why tf OP would consider having a child with someone who so completely lacks respect for her. Jfc.", "Please tell me this pregnancy is hypothetical.", "Yes! The \"please stop talking\" should be a big red flag.", "Also asked yourself how much about you he\u2019s already shared.", "She woukd be an asshole to herself but she still wouldnt be THE asshole.", "Serious question -- couldn't she keep the details \"secret\" if  she excludes him from the birth?  The medical team won't share details about her with him, unless she has authorized it.  So he won't know about epidurals, tearing, etc.  \n\nWould that fix it?\n\nAnother way to fix it is to send him packing.", "Run", "Only if she shares. After all, she would have full control of who's allowed in the room when she gives birth. If she doesn't trust her bf to not share information,  she doesn't have to have him in there, father or not, and he wouldn't know.", "Seriously I would be telling nobody if I had tearing. Nobody needs to hear about the state of my vagina. The only thing more stressful than having tearing would be hearing every woman on earth's opinion on my vagina.", "This! Also, I would inform him if that's his take, he cannot be there for the birth of the baby.", "This. This right here. How much has he already told his family about you that you don't know about? Alot of things like favorite food or color or normal stuff like that - ok fine. But more private things? Things that you told him in confidence? I'd be weary to be honest. I'd have a hard time trusting him NOT to tell his family.", "She'd be a super-shitty parent to knowingly conceive a child with someone who she knows doesn't respect her.  She'd be an asshole to her kid.", "Then you'll have a whole drama about him not being allowed to be at the birth. OP mentioned that he said \"if it involves his child's birth\". I think he'd throw a huge fit, if he were to be excluded. Not to mention his family's side would probably shame OP. \n\nPlus, maybe OP would also just like to have her partner be with her during the birth. It would suck to feel like she has to choose between his support during the birth or him going around telling the details of her privates around.", "If she needs to do that, is really someone she should be planning to reproduce with?  It's probably just going to be the tip of the iceberg, and then there will be a kid dragged through the middle of it.", "If she doesn\u2019t trust him to respect her in this medical matter why be with him at all?", "As women, who are we to judge, if someone has childbirth difficulties???????????????\nI'd want to keep it private, too, but seriously?\n  Sigh.", "You are no longer planning on breeding with this person", "Unfortunately, when a woman has a child, she will often hear \"advice\" - back seat driving from every freaking relative, co-worker and passerby on medical, diet and child-rearing issues - for decades!", "You are no longer planning on breeding with this person.", "Or the conception.", "Seriously. OP, ask your BF to ask his sister how she feels about you knowing her personal medical decisions and how she feels about him using her experience as an argument against your choices. \n\nNTA", "Oh, she shouldn't. But I've seen and heard too many \"but I love him!\" responses, so giving another option. Which, considering his response, would probably start another shit show.", "I never said it wasnt private, I meant on the whole \"its illegal\" part"]}
