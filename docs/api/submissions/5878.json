I can understand why a court would think a couple with 5 kids already would be fine to raise a 6th.  When you are talking big numbers like that childwise, there's probably not a massive difference between the costs of 5 v's 6 kids other than food.  Heck schools around here often have 5th and subsequent kids free for tuition when they are all enrolled at the same time (there are many private schools that are all the way from elementary to 12th grade ie F/P - 12 schools here).

As for your brothers other kids: They are your nephews too!!!! Maybe you could have cool uncle's weekends where they all come and stay at your super cool beach house?  Maybe offer to babysit every other weekend: maybe your brother and wife can have some time to themselves.  Just because you have money doesn't mean you are ready to be a parent and just because someone doesn't have money doesn't make them a bad parent.  Maybe consider slowly being a meaningful ADDITION to Jesse's life and then you can see if you want to be a full time parent.  Maybe later down the line Jesse will want to live with you, but right now jumping a kid around from place to place is only going to harm him.  Moreover, you've said in comments you've plenty of money to where you could get a surrogate.

If he wants to start a war, he shouldn't be crawling back asking for a bailout. NTA and please don't give up on the kid.", "Doesn\u2019t mean the nephew will thrive with other uncle (OP) either - he has just lost his parents.", "If this is true, how did you not have a better lawyer than your brother?", "Well that is crappy of OPs brother. He can't treat his nephew exactly the same as his own kids, as they have their parents, siblings, etc while Jesse has likely gone through something traumatic. They have different needs. It depends on what we're talking about. If the kid is doing poorly in school, does he need tutoring? Is private school still a possibility? (Not that I think that's neccessarily the best thing for him, buf regardless). Does he need therapy? Idk. There are things that a kid who lost a parent might need that OPs brothers kids don't.", "And I also didn't neccessarily mean strictly financial help in my original comment. Maybe they live too far away, but even if Jesse doesn't live with OP  maybe actually have 1:1 outings, phone calls to talk, etc. Just because OP doesn't hsve gaurdianship doesn't mean he can't TRY to help his nephew out. It almost seems he enjoyed watching his brother fail, even if it meant Jesse suffered - despite likely being able to help prior to now despite not having gaurdianship.", ">Mike and his wife run their family as tribes. They share everything.\n\nBruh, what does sharing everything has to do with tribes? Is this supposed to be derogatory towards native people or something? I sure hope that is not intentional for you.\n\n>Mike's kids are going to turn to savages when puberty hits.\n\nHow do you know what they would become? \n\nThis is such a troll post, either that or a guy who does not have good conscience to understand that taking a child away from a family that they are already established in is generally a bad idea.", "Then go visit Jesse. Let him know that you will try (no promises) to get custody of you if he wants. Discuss with him alone... not with everyone else there. Ask what he wants. Not just in relation to bedrooms and what money can provide but a special passion -- baseball or a dog or simply someone to help with homework for an hour each night.\n\nDiscuss with lawyer about total and/or joint custody; whatever s/he feels if feasible. If nothing else, knowing things about Jesse will help you in gaining custody and in making sharing lives easier.\n\nGood luck. I don't know why but even though you seem to have an A H-ish attitude on this post, I genuinely believe you'll make a good parent for Jesse.", "Is it no contact or not", "Yup it'll go from \"help jesse he has no parents and we're struggling with our other kids\" to \"help all our kids as you helped jesse and they're all equally your niblings\". Eventually it'll become \"help us as it's the least you can do for us taking care of all the kids\" as though they didn't go to court for one of them and fuck to have the others", "Exactly.  The brother who got custody probably denied the OP any sort of visitation.", "Is this money part of the reason they wanted Jesse to live with them ?", "Sounds like he was on drugs due to illness. As in he couldn't make decisions in the event of his passing with a sound mind.", "But getting a parent figure\u2019s full attention would be better than getting lost in the crowd. At the very least Jesse should have counseling.", "My house is 3 bedrooms. I don't do condos. My neighbors are the trees and the beach.", "This is the whole reason why Jesse would \u201cmost likely\u201d be better off with OP. He wants Jesse to have advantages. Nothing will ever make up for the loss of his parents but it\u2019s got to be better than being stuck with a floundering family.", "Op said he is a gay man and he cant have kids in the comment, I dont think he wants to do this for the kid as much as he wants to do this for himself", "We found a workaround. Instead of offering our family members money, we'd ask what they required and we'd buy it for them. That way we can say we are still helping them whilst knowing 100% that the money is being used for what is needed. \n\nStrangely, they stopped asking us for financial assistance when we began doing that. Except when it's actually needed for their children which is surprisingly rare given how often they needed our money prior.", "Exactly, that's what I would have done.  If this is about providing the best care and loving family for this poor kid, then you show up, you be there for him, you help out the family.\n\nLetting it go for a year says all there is to say about OP.", "Except it's up to Jesse's guardian. Ie. OPs brother.", "In that case, small wonder a kid whose dad (apparently his only parent) was so ill he had to be drugged for a prolonged period of time is having trouble adjusting to school.", "This is my point. Jesse will need support. Assuming that because a child who has lost both parents is not currently thriving (only educationally as stated by OP) does not mean this will always be the case. It is a relatively short time to measure success in terms of his current place (lots of change going on). \n\nLet put this in hypotheticals - if there were no family involved and this was down to foster families - would you suggest that a year is enough time for a child to \u201cget over their loss and settle into a new family\u201d? Or would you still expect for there to be issues/adjustments?\n\nAs a former teacher who has seen children go through traumas - there can be educational implications and changes for years. I think pointing at underperforming in school can be shortsighted when the focus should be on the emotional and psychological well-being of the child in question.", "Are you in a relationship or married? Just curious.\n\nAlso all you said in your post is how you can provide a better life for your nephew big house and send him to private school. You never mentioned how you love him or care about him. He\u2019s just a trophy yikes dude. Poor kid.", "The \u201cmoron\u201d attitude is not going to help going forward. Rise above. You may disagree with your brothers decisions but please avoid this attitude if you get custody - it doesn\u2019t benefit anyone - least of all Jesse.", "Oh bullshit. You need to seriously get over yourself.", "Oh please.\n\nOP is explaining the situation to a bunch of strangers, not bad mouthing his brother to Jesse.\n\nHis brother is a moron, a moron who did not have Jesses best interests at heart.\n\nJesse needs lots of therapy and attention after what happened, being with a moron who is incapable of providing the help he needs due to monetary reasons and number of kids is not in his best interests.", "It's not the OP's responsibility to make sure his brothers 5 child are also provided for if he gives money/pays for Jesse.  His brother and SIL chose to have 5 kids and then they decided they wanted this one too.", "Is it harassing to call or text to check in or ask to visit? No. Has OP given any indication of whether he has done this? Yes his brother should have offered opportunities for OP to visit (as he knew OP wanted to share custody etc.) But OP is equally responsible for pursuing any and all opportunities to visit with  and spend time with Jesse (and his other nephews if this is something if interest to him)."]}
