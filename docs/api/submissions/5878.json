Especially gross to call his wife \"nasty\" and she's right, you clearly are a bully.\n\nIt's unsurprising that a judge would grant an established family custody of a child vs a single person, no matter how much money you have. If you really cared about your nephew's wellbeing, money-wise, then you could have easily just been giving them a little money every month to help support him.\n\nYour brother reached out to you, probably swallowed a lot of pride, to ask for money and you basically extorted another custody hearing out of him to try and selfishly rip away an orphan from the family he's been welcomed into and established for the past year. Being surrounded by family, siblings, is a lot more important for a young child than \"a really cool house by the beach\".\n\nUltimately, you had the perfect opportunity to be the awesome fun uncle and you fucked it up.
