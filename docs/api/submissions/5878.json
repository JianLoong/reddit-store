NTA.", "He cut off contact because his brother who didn\u2019t have the means for another child backstabbed him in court because some judges would rather a child in poverty with 2 parents than a child having a single male parent who has means to provide. It\u2019s a known bias in family court.", "Not in his court to one way contact a minor nephew that was legally taken from him. Don\u2019t see how fighting a lost battle would make him any good mentally also. If the backstabbing brother didn\u2019t agree with keeping contact I don\u2019t see many other options.", "That's not how custody works lol. You can't  just sue them for thier child", "Some are just appalled that OP thinks that he would be a better 'Dad' because he has money. Despite not haven seen the boy for a year, he just knows that Jesse would be better off with him. Suppose Jesse doesn't want to leave his new family? Does OP know the first thing about raising a child- hint it's not all about money.\n\nChances are that Jesse needs therapy first with losing his parents and then going through a custody battle. Is OP willing to put him in therapy and do the hard work, some soul searching? Or does he just want to gloat over his brother and get tired of having Jesse around when he realizes how hard it is to be a parent?", "OP I can assure you we're all VERY impressed with you", "You're getting downvoted for some reason but I'm 100% on team Substantial\\_Duck.  You tried to step up to take care of a kid that wasn't yours and you didn't have a real obligation to.  You are not a charity.  You built a successful life for yourself and had the means to give Jesse all the opportunities one could hope for their own child, and I imagine your late brother probably would have wanted that as well.  Instead, Mike betrayed you and ignored your warnings and subsequently/predictably finds himself in the situation he currently does.\n\nFor those saying that you are using Jesse and the situation as a pawn, ignore them.  You saw this situation happening already and being aware that giving them a band-aid now will not fix the problem, your condition to provide help as long as they modify guardianship will actually do things the smart way for once instead of the problematic way Mike is currently operating.

You probably don't know anything about him now.", "Actually!! Yes she can go and get a lawyer and sue for custody.. again she wants visitations and I\u2019m sure with the right lawyer she will be able to.. also if that don\u2019t work then let the family fall on their ass so hard that they ain\u2019t got money enough for all them kids and he will most likely give u the nephew\u2026 I\u2019m all for pettiness!! Specially since he play her.", "Lots of us are friends with our cousins LMAO", "Seems fairly logical given the other brother is not able to provide properly. What I don\u2019t agree with is with OP bailing and enabling his brother. He is delusional thinking he\u2019s getting anything paid back, and he already got backstabbed once.", "Nope you csnt just demand custody or visitation of someone else's chlld. Furthermore being proud of being petty isn't a good thing. This may surprise people like you but being petty is bad personality teiwit", "I understand why you didn't get custody", "Who gives a fuck!", "I'm not saying show up unannounced. I'm saying you should be reaching out to your brother to arrange to see Jesse. If  this is really about having a relationship with your nephew, you would do whatever you needed to do to make it happen. Kinda sounds like you value your pride more than your nephew.", "What in the world? OP, I totally agree with you here. THEY went no contact, they can let you in his life bc they are now his parents, & they know you want to be since you offered to adopt him! These people saying you are at fault for not bending over backwards clearly don\u2019t get it. Also, I think you\u2019re NTA (obviously).", "Sure does. Just because you\u2019re incapable and unwilling to put in the work to be a good parents doesn\u2019t make it untrue.", "So he just needs to harass them to get his point across? Instead of telling them his wishes, but then respecting them as the parents? He clearly wants to be in the kid\u2019s life. It\u2019s in literally every part of this. Including the deal to borrow money now. Harassing the parents isn\u2019t gonna help anything.", "Are you stupid or just that out of touch with the real world? You\u2019re insufferable and so, so selfish. I hope your brother uses these posts against you in court.", "Well thanks.

Those things seem to be in short supply with his brother. \n\nI think too much hate has been thrown on the OP just because he is wealthy and living the good life\".", "No offence but it sounds like you can\u2019t offer much emotional support and your bro can\u2019t offer much financial support, so why don\u2019t you both just combine the efforts so you can help financially and your bro can offer him the family life. When you\u2019re family you just do what you can to make sure the children are good. Your life you want to offer sounds a bit lonely for a young boy.

Why are you so desperate to gain custody of him?  For 2 years he's been part of your brother's family.  Do you really have what it takes to raise a child?  It takes more then a private school, sports, and a cool house at the beach takes.  Because, you are not willing to set your pride aside and think about what is really best for him.  You just assume you are the bee's knees.", "INFO: You do realize that the most likely outcome of all this is that he takes the money and then ghosts you again, right?", "So many questions...\n\nHave you loan your brother money before? Does he pay you back? Reluctantly or without nagging by you? If you give him the money, how much of it will benefit Jesse?\n\nWhy do you want Jesse? As a favor to your dead brother and his wife? As a parental figure without the added head/heart-ache of a wife/girlfriend? To get to know him as an individual?\n\nHow is he treated in Mike's family?  As an individual or just another member of the pack? How do they approach school and after school activities?  All the boys in one sport because it's convenient? Each boy in something he excels at or finds fascinating? Is Jesse separated out as 'not belonging' by his cousin/brothers?\n\nHow would things be different for Jesse if you were the primary custodian? What kind of things would you and he do? With or without his cousin/brothers?\n\nIf these are the kind of things going through your head, then you are NTA. And I'd suggest you contact your lawyer and discuss taking over custody of Jesse due to Mike & wife's failure to provide adequately in a significant emotional way.

Clearly you don't care for this child and want him as some sort of show pony. I hope your brother the best", "His nasty wife is right.   Look, there's obviously nothing wrong with single child families or single parents, but I think a lot would agree that a kid will have a better experience with siblings and 2 parents (especially as you cite nothing wrong with them as parents or a family).  What you SHOULD have done after you went to court was to OFFER to help rather than making him beg for it.", "In this situation your NTA!

Everyone is saying that OP\u2019s brother did this out of the kindness of his heart. But it sounds like he just did it to get the money as he was already drowning in dead. One doesn\u2019t get 20K in debt in a year. Well\u2026 maybe u do if ur an idiot. Now the brother is trying to play on OP\u2019s sympathy to get money out of him.

But why do you assume private school will be better? I\u2019m a teacher and just because class sizes are smaller it doesn\u2019t mean that children will automatically do better.

Perhaps a therapist and working with his school initially would be a better plan than changing everything in his life at once (if you plan on him moving in with you).

Really??? They aren't a Hermes bag or a Ferrari or an expensive gaming system. They are children who should only be brought into the world and into a household where they will be loved and treated well, not acquired to prove a damn point. Kids aren't acquisitions.

Are you taking time off work to help him settle in and adjust? You going to help him adjust to another new school? What about childcare? Is he going to be left with a nanny or do you have a schedule where you can be there for him? How about socialisation, like youth groups and teams so he can make new friends? You going to factor him into your dating choices and be cautious about having people around him? How about if Jesse wants to go back with his cousins? Will you respect that or force him to stay with you? Have you once stopped to consider what Jesse needs? \n\nYTA, and all the mansions and money in the world won't change that.
