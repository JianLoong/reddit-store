I can understand why a court would think a couple with 5 kids already would be fine to raise a 6th.  When you are talking big numbers like that childwise, there's probably not a massive difference between the costs of 5 v's 6 kids other than food.  Heck schools around here often have 5th and subsequent kids free for tuition when they are all enrolled at the same time (there are many private schools that are all the way from elementary to 12th grade ie F/P - 12 schools here).

As for your brothers other kids: They are your nephews too!!!! Maybe you could have cool uncle's weekends where they all come and stay at your super cool beach house?  Maybe offer to babysit every other weekend: maybe your brother and wife can have some time to themselves.  Just because you have money doesn't mean you are ready to be a parent and just because someone doesn't have money doesn't make them a bad parent.  Maybe consider slowly being a meaningful ADDITION to Jesse's life and then you can see if you want to be a full time parent.  Maybe later down the line Jesse will want to live with you, but right now jumping a kid around from place to place is only going to harm him.  Moreover, you've said in comments you've plenty of money to where you could get a surrogate.

He said he wanted partial guardianship with a plan to take full guardianship in exchange for the money.\n\nI find the focus on money and legal obligations in this sub diverts discussions a lot, let\u2019s just not speculate our own plot twists.\n\nThis is what happens in custodial situations, because ex partners move on and have more kids/stepkids. Anyway, the point I was making is adding one kid will mean spreading resources thinner across the board - asking for a detailed cost accounting of that is counterproductive. Not sure if you have kids or seen these coparenting issues.\n\nTL/DR (sorry it got long lol) Some of the money should go to cover the child\u2019s costs -and if it\u2019s a lot, you would have to trust. Trust that the person you trust with your child is ok with your money (in an ideal world). That\u2019s not to say I\u2019d trust someone whose good with money, with my child. I\u2019d rather lose money and my kid was raised in a wholesome family, than save my kid\u2019s money but he loses his joy growing up alone\u2026\n\n\u2014 - - - this is where I ramble lol \u2014-\n\nIf it were me. The child is the focus. I have a kid alone (the entire time), I know what comfortable living for two is like for a kid. And I have a big family and know what it\u2019s like for him with them. Let\u2019s be real, I wouldn\u2019t want my grieving child growing up with more of this lifestyle when the love isn\u2019t even that of a parent. That\u2019s all that keeps us together as a family of two, love. That this nephew just lost.\n\nYes this boy needs space to grieve. He\u2019s not used to the noise and inevitably the family energy will impose on the grieving process. And immediately having a full family may cause guilt given he just lost his parents. However, that family can provide the structure and nurturing he will need in future.\n\nSo I would say the brothers should join forces. Not argue over guardianship for the sake of it (as OP is doing as per the info provided). OP can provide all the support without being named guardian.\n\nWith the two brothers together, their nephew can have a staggered transition. Easy access to OPs place and also the other brother. Space in both places, but also open to other niblings hanging out at their uncle\u2019s on occasion (they can bond with their cousin - and will feel equal to their uncle). The nephew shouldn\u2019t feel like the child being cut in half here OR prized over others.  Roger can go to either uncle and know they\u2019ll be there for him. And maybe a schedule where he gets steady routine for school with his cousins, and one day of the weekend at OPs and a plan for afternoons/evenings he needs space. Allow the nephew to then adapt that schedule so eventually his social life and things would naturally move into his spare time, and routine and bonds with his cousins are not forced (or resisted)\u2026but developed.\n\nHe would need a family and it truly can be a bonus. As a single parent my kid knows his cousins and their family would always take care of him - that gives him peace, and belonging beyond me. But it\u2019s totally true it can be overwhelming if he\u2019s in a bad place, and grief would be that. It\u2019s not good to push the family stuff so soon so hard without a space for him to just be. But that isolated single parent life - that would kill a child whose experienced loss. I see it everyday in a kid whose experienced a quarter of that loss. \n\nIt\u2019s imho blind of me to ignore what the post says and the focus on guardianship  and one upping his brother OVER actual understanding of a child\u2019s needs and the grief process.\n\nThe money would help his brother better accommodate his nephew. OP refuses because they want guardianship (period). \n\nOP claims Mike and his wife are bad parents who don\u2019t take care of themselves. But a court found their 4 other kids are fine and they do parent them well. \n\nSocial workers would tell OP he qualifies and has a fair chance on paper of course - we see that too. But it cannot make up for the attitude and self-interest OP displays. I can\u2019t imagine entrusting my kid with that (and yes I have a sibling whose amazing on paper but very ego driven and short sighted - especially in matters to do with others feelings and needs). Everyone has their strengths and mean well, but I just cannot ignore all this and what I read to opt for a speculation the brother did this for the money.\n\nI don\u2019t know the $ amount either but it would be hard for me to fathom taking in a child I cannot care for - dealing with their grief of this magnitude - on top of 4 kids and a marriage\u2026.for money. \n\nTotal tangent, my will would include a buffer for the other kids in the event of my death. This is because I\u2019d expect the family taking my kid would treat the kids equally (including mine being treated well, even if they have more than I). In my case it\u2019s a college fund for each kid, and small buffer to spend on mine that\u2019s a top up to their regular living cost. Any excess would be given to my kid. It\u2019s not rational to expect adoptive parents to be fair, but then blame them for things they didn\u2019t do when they\u2019re trying to make it fair. Some of the money should go to cover the child\u2019s costs - and if it\u2019s a lot, you would have to trust. Trust that the person you trust with your child is ok with your money (in an ideal world). That\u2019s not to say I\u2019d trust someone whose good with money, with my child. I\u2019d rather lose money and my kid was raised in a wholesome family, than save my kid\u2019s money but he loses his joy growing up alone\u2026", ">This may surprise people like you but being petty is bad personality teiwit\n\nIt also doesn't play well in family court lol", "Nah, the OP is racist.\n\nApparently the only kids Orange County will 'give' him are 'thugs' and 'gangbangers'.", "I'm starting to wonder of the reason why ops brother took custody was because he might be able to squeeze op since op clearly wanted the kid.", "Not to be rude, but asking? If OP went  NC after his brother got full custody (his brother choosing this against his will) - his brother may not have offered opportunities. Him reaching out would also help his case with custody agreements going forward - if his attempts at contact were rebuffed.\n\nI have family members (step-relatives with grandchildren) who they no longer have contact with but I always advise to reach out and keep records of all attempts at contact - for their record when looking at custody/visitation going forward.", "Just had a thought before going to bed, but...is OP technically admitting to human trafficking?\n\n> I agreed to give him the money [$20,000] on the condition that he and I file for a joint guardianship next year. The goal is for Jesse to live with me.\n\nThey gave someone money with the understanding that in return they would receive custody of a child in the future. Am I crazy?", "ESH it should be about what\u2019s best for Jesse not what any of you want. Poor kid needs a court appointed guardian.", "wow your brother is an asshole. I got to be careful with my wording here because according to the mods, the only swear word allowed is \"asshole\". NTA. Your brother is.", "ESH", "Info: Can you elaborate on your \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201cgangbanger\u201d comment. What did you mean by collecting fostering/ adopted children from the OC that?", "INFO - How does your brother feel about you being gay?  I am curious as to why there has been \"next to no contact in a year.\"  My default is NTA when relatives come out of the woodwork asking for help.", "YTA.", ">*I took him to court .. but Mike backstabbed me and filed for sole guardship ... After he won, I expected him to initiate a relationship with me and Jesse. That's what I would had done*\n\nNo it is not   \n\n\nI USED MY HUGE WEALTH TO SUE MY BROTHER TO TAKE AWAY HIS KID BUT HE BETRAYED ME BY TRYING TO KEEP HIS KID AND NOW HE DOESN'T WANT TO SHARE THE KID I TRIED TO TAKE AWAY FROM HIM???!!!!  \n\n\n.. is not a sentence a mentally sound person could type", "This is your chance to backstab him back and get custody use this against him as evidence in court!", "Read OP's comments. I wouldn't trust him with a pet rock. Keeping that kid away from this raving narcissist is the best thing the brother could do.", "Read OP's comments, he's a raving narcissist.", "Also, learn to type", "Read OP's comments, he's worse.", "OP says he 'doesn't know what he wants', so I'm guessing kiddo didn't want to go near his arrogant, self-absorbed uncle.", "loving guardians who are inept at managing or earning money. But that's what OP is for right? OP is there for his money.", "where's your bugatti? LOL", "Honestly, that's not a bad way to approach things. As long as it's entertaining, it probably won't hurt you.\n\nI don't care much either way - if it's a real person/issue I gave my input the way I think it's the best. If I can do so much as make someone think in a positive/constructive way it's a win. If it's fake I selected a dialogue option and received approval/disapproval. Not that different from an RPG. The graphics suck, but the dialogue is more interesting. It's not like I had something better to do.\n\nOn the other hand, you'd be surprised how full of misery and stupidity this world is. If you're an \"average/normal\" person (no insult intended, I'm not sure how to put it better), your fantasy might not be good enough to depict how bad humanity can truly be.", "nah dude. I am Asian, a whole continent away from whoever the OP is and I agree with the OP. It's a broke man's cope that moves him to say \" I don't need money to raise a kid, all i need is love and to backstab someone for child custody.\" If the brother didn't need money, why is he now asking for money? I You guys are just glorifying financial ineptitude. Sounds like you are all bitter that people got more money than you.", "I don\u2019t know the $ amount either but it would be hard for me to fathom taking in a child I cannot care for - dealing with their grief of this magnitude - on top of 4 kids and a marriage\u2026.for money.\n\nI\u2019ve worked in estate law long enough to see that many, many people do things just for the money. Which is why when OP mentioned shared custody and the brother went back on that\u2026I thought benefits. Shared custody would usually come with some kind of shared benefits. Just like a lot of foster parents do it for the money, not because they love kids (although many do)."]}
