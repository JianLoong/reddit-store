We bought 4 half a liter bottles of water before going to a very touristy (and sunny) place for the day. In the hotel I put two in my backpack and gave her the other two. She forgot them. She noticed this once we got to the place, so I gave her one of the two bottles I had. We saw places that sold water but she said it was too expensive and didn\u2019t want to buy more. I thought I could manage with the half liter I had left, so we kept walking. Not even 2 hours later she had finished her bottle, so she went to my backpack drank a sip from mine. I was being careful with my water consumption and it bothered me. Still I didn\u2019t say anything but when she went for another sip maybe half an hour later something must\u2019ve shown on my face because she felt the need to comment on it, telling me I could relax she was just drinking a little bit of it.\n\n2. When I\u2019m traveling I make sure that both my phone and my power bank are fully charged by the time I wake up. On a traveling day, soon after leaving the hotel, my friend said that her phone was at 30%. I was annoyed because I can\u2019t see why she couldn\u2019t have let it charge overnight. She kept using it until it and then asked to use my power-bank, I gave it to her but asked her to use it only until it had used up 50% of the charge, so that I could have some left if my phone needed it. She asked why and told me it wasn\u2019t fair since my phone was still at 60%. it was the middle of the day and I wanted to be sure I had some charge left once we arrived to our destination. She wasn\u2019t happy about it, but respected my wishes, commenting a couple of times on the fact that she had to put her phone in airplane mode.\n\n3. I don\u2019t know if this one is all in my head or if she also counted it, but we were traveling with backpacks and at some point she bought some books that added maybe 3/4 kg to her load, she didn\u2019t say anything about struggling with the weight until she had to move my backpack and found it way lighter than hers, then she commented on the weight difference and how tired she was getting.We sat for a moment and she started taking out stuff from her backpack and it made me wonder if she was expecting me to offer to take some of the load. I didn\u2019t, I had packed lightly for a reason. She didn\u2019t say anything so maybe i\u2019m projecting.\n\nI feel like I was reasonable in coming to her help but not crossing my own boundaries to accomodate her.

You were prepared for the activities on the vacation and your friend wasn't. It seems like a case where she needed to suffer the consequences of her own acts. Failing to prepare means preparing to fail. I hope you were still able to enjoy your vacation. Based on your friends actions, I wouldn't blame you if this was the last time you vacationed with them. That doesn't mean you can't stay friends, but I would pick and choose carefully where I took them in the future.", "NTA.\n\nThe problem here isn't that you don't know how to share.

Nope, you are definitely NTA. \n\nI'd think twice before travelling with this friend again.", "NTA. She was ill-prepared multiple times and expected you to inconvenience yourself for her. You were truly more gracious with her than I would have been. I'm not sharing my limited amount of water with someone who forgot theirs in the hotel. That's her fault.", "NTA.

You know perfectly well how to share since you gave your friend one of your two water bottles.  Your friend was then presumptuous to drink from your bottle without asking first.

You're not the person who doesn't know how to share, your friend is a person who feels entitled to all of your shit to make up for their own failure to plan and be prepared.\n\nFrom everything you've said it's not enough to just share with her, she wants you to give up your own share of things to her as well. She's being selfish and trying to make you feel guilty for it.", "NTA your friend is not fun to travel with and prepares badly.", "NTA!

Yeah, you're perfectly capable of sharing, it's just that she's rather inept at taking care of herself, thinking ahead, staying on top of things, etc. You're not her mom and she's not a little girl, you don't need to bend over backwards or suffer or put yourself at a detriment because she, an over 30 year old woman, failed to plan accordingly (and doesn't seem to learn from her mistakes / miscalculations) and needs a hero.", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing if it\u2019s an emergency, but when she can\u2019t plan properly\u2026 that doesn\u2019t make it your problem. \n\nShe forgot her water\u2026 she can buy some.

There is no social construct where you buy the box of cereal and on the way out of the store you are required to give handfuls to passer-bys because they think the cereal is too expensive. \n\nBut these were your items.
