We were thrilled. \n\nHowever, she said she would be staying at a hotel and would only like to see me and my husband at a restaurant outside. I was heartbroken that she didn't want to include Michael. I asked her to please visit us at home so she could see her brother as well. She is not having it.\n\nI asked her why she made this decision. She said she wanted a peaceful evening with her parents. I told her she needed to see her brother too since we're all a family and we need to stick together. Elizabeth told me to never mind, that she wasn't coming and that she made a mistake.\n\nI feel really bad for making her cancel the trip.

Between her pushing to have her son invited, and Elizabeth not even wanting to see him, reading between the lines - he is not easy, takes up a lot of energy, and probably throws tantrums/has a meltdown far more frequently than OP admits, and Elizabeth has been having to tiptoe around it for years.  I think OP and her husband have been in denial about how this affected Elizabeth for a long time.", "Translation: parents with high special needs children are automatically neglectful assholes and it's fine to make up your own conclusions about them without any other evidence about the situation.\n\nLord this sub is tiring sometimes.", "Only because that's how you want to take it.\n\nJust because she didn't fill you in on details doesn't make it a blanket statement.", "Plus, some parents think their autistic kids are helpless and that that\u2019s a valid excuse not to parent them. We all know what happens when you spoil a kid.\n\nI\u2019m autistic. I know many autistic people. Autistic kids are still kids, and kids need love and stability and someone who teaches them how to deal with the challenges of life. Is that always possible with high-support needs children? Nope. But don\u2019t make life worse for them.", "Thank you so much for your very kind words, that's so sweet of you.\n\nMy older brother and husband are both diagnosed autistic since childhood, and as a female autism is regularly overlooked. So I've spent a lot of my time being the daughter in this story (but not as extreme) whilst having my own needs myself. Watching my brother get everything handed to him without effort and being capable of having a job but using autism as an excuse, whereas I've fought and worked my butt off to support myself and get to where I am today... it is tough.\n\nApparently here in the UK, the assessment waiting lists are up to 2 years, which isn't very helpful at all but at least I'm now in the system. I think I chose the worst time to seek a diagnosis, as I have several chronic serious health conditions which require medical intervention, so adding another addition to my list isn't very helpful, but I guess once I do get my diagnosis, it could help me navigate other aspects of my life with better support.\n\nOP really is an AH for both ignoring her daughter's very human and understandable needs, and for using the most patronising and ridiculous language to describe an autism diagnosis- you wouldn't say someone SADLY has brown hair or blue eyes, so yeah...", "I'm guessing they mostly just paid for it and dropped her off at lessons and competitions. If they did attend any events, most of their attention was probably on their son.", "Mostly the former", "It was every birthday until she was 24. After that she told me she wanted to celebrate her birthday with her friends so I stopped.", "They are TA right now, for insisting that the only choices are mini family reunion or no visit at all. The parents are the ones that are not amenable to a visit with just their daughter.", "I don't see it as the past because it's still happening in the present. That's why Elizabeth canceled her trip. The forcing of a relationship. But that's just my opinion. The same actions of the past are still happening", "That must have been so hard for you. I'm sorry. \n\nI had an older sister that was a quadriplegic and a young sister that was a paraplegic and I spent so much of my child and teen years helping to care for them. My parents were never at events. I missed events myself because I had to be home, or no one could take me. We were never short of food but any extra money went to medical bills, treatments. \n\nBut my older sister was a beautiful ray of sunshine and my life was better for having her in it. And though my younger sister was sass on a stick, I loved her as well.", "This input is so important, thank you for sharing! I hope OP does read your comment specifically", "If thats what you want to take from my comments okay.\nOr you could take that parents need to also balance time with their kids that dont have medical needs and ensure they are getting all their needs met. \nSure their physical needs can be met easily, but theirs emotional, social needs that often do get ignored. \nNot every parent is like this, but some are.

We're not helpless, we require more support.   \n\n\nI know many people with autism, and some of these people aren't my friends because they were raised on the basis of \"you are owed the world and can do no wrong because you have special needs\" aka weren't parented but many are my friends and give me fond memories.   \n\n\nI, however, have to admit that I'd probably be in agreeance with OP's daughter here. Michael probably realizes that his sister resents him to some extent. He's not stupid. If a baby (not to say he's a baby, but mentally he's not the biological age he presents) can understand hurt then so can someone who is mentally challenged.   \n\n\nJust because Michael is nonverbal, has seizures, and needs round the clock care? He's not stupid, he likely understands when someone doesn't like him or want to be around him just like everyone else. His brain isn't broken, it's just slower and needs a little more help. It doesn't mean forcing him to bond with his sister or his sister to bond with him.", "I understand some of what you feel. Funny I was diagnosed autistic first but only found ourt 20 years later (20!) that ADHD was the cause of the things that bother me most (that and likely c-PTSD, yay).\n\nYou\u2019re on the waiting list now and that is important. You\u2019ve got time to let that sink in because two years.. ugh. The sooner on the list the better, I guess.\n\nAs a fellow woman I recognize that girls are left to their devices more than boys, and the medical field is centered around white male subjects who do not have to deal with intense hormonal cycles like we do.

Thank you so much for sharing, I really do appreciate it, friendly internet stranger.\n\nThe medical field needs to change and stop treating women's genuine physical and mental medical conditions as \"women's problems\", but treat men with more care and seriousness if they present with similar symptoms.

She can't get one dinner because of Michael.", "Occam\u2019s Razor would like a talk", "OP has a 26-year old autistic child whose meltdowns she describes as tantrums.

Don\u2019t worry about taking on the world, focus on you first. I think it\u2019s amazing that you want to lobby for better care and undoubtedly you will find more women in your position.

Singular, not plural. So what are you basing the claims your making on - because it\u2019s not what is in the post?", "She's staying for several days and only wants to see them out of the house. Literally what I said.\n\nWhat I'd like to know is how people make the leap from 'wants a peaceful evening' to 'neglected/parentified'. Her brother's medical issues being disruptive does not automatically mean she was abused, but that's the assumption everyone is making in this thread."]}
