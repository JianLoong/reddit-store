We were thrilled. \n\nHowever, she said she would be staying at a hotel and would only like to see me and my husband at a restaurant outside. I was heartbroken that she didn't want to include Michael. I asked her to please visit us at home so she could see her brother as well. She is not having it.\n\nI asked her why she made this decision. She said she wanted a peaceful evening with her parents. I told her she needed to see her brother too since we're all a family and we need to stick together. Elizabeth told me to never mind, that she wasn't coming and that she made a mistake.\n\nI feel really bad for making her cancel the trip.

Is that what you want to happen? My mom is currently in the hospital with a cancer diagnosis that does not look good, and has everyone calling or messaging me that she\u2019s sorry and regrets what she said. I can not bring myself to care though, my relationship with her is already dead so I will not be calling or visiting her, that could be your future if you don\u2019t realize you can not control who your adult daughter spends time with.", "YTA - This is how kids go no contact with their parents. Your daughter wanted time with her parents for a reason and you made it about your son.", "Yeah I think we\u2019re missing a lot here. OP sounds like one of those parents who makes everything about Michael and whose plan for when they can no longer take care of Michael is for daughter to take over. \n\nOP if you are reading these comments you need to make sure you aren\u2019t seeing your daughter as a future caretaker plan, she needs to have worth outside of how she interacts with her brother and you need to make sure she knows that her relationship with you and your husband isn\u2019t dependent on how and if she interacts with her brother.

I was the neglected older daughter and my brother doesn\u2019t even have any special needs (my parents just wanted a boy). Now i have an older daughter and an autistic younger son.

How often did you or your husband spend quality time with her growing up? Show an interest in her hobbies?  How many times did you turn her into an extra carer for her brother?  Siblings of children with disabilities often get emotionally neglected maybe you should talk to your daughter with an open mind about how she experienced her childhood to see why she doesn't want to be around her brother.", "I have to wonder what her childhood was like. One of my best friends from college has a sister that has special needs. Growing up, he never got to go to amusement parks or carnivals or baseball games bc of his sister's sensory sensitivities.  Every single family outing revolved around her needs and never his.  He spent his teen years babysitting instead of getting to play sports or do after school activities.  It was especially hard for him bc she was 4 years older and as strong as him. He feels like he missed out on life. Now, at 40, he barely speaks to his parents. \n\nOP, I'm not saying this exact thing is what happened to your daughter,  but the need to meet alone or not at all is *very* suggestive.  Maybe she was trying to repair your relationship.  Mayne she needed help. Maybe she feels alone or suicidal.  You'll never know now, bc you let her down.  I'm guessing, not for the first time.", "He speaks a few sentences and needs constant care by others, he also has a lot of issues with seizures that sometimes slip out of control.", "This is a pretty clear argument for YTA instead of NAH.", ">Sadly, parents that have one of the children autistic tend to make their life revolve around then, ditching ither children to themselves or even parentifying them\n\nWould that not make the parents AH?

You only answered the question about your son. Is that something you do often because I think I know why your daughter has very little contact with you.

No fucking wonder she doesn't want to see him!", "So in other words he needs attention almost all the time because of his needs. And has for almost all of your daughters childhood. That is a huge burden for a family already. But if the parents don\u2019t balance the small path carefully enough one child will suffer immensely. And it seems that your daughter was the suffering child that was neglected because of her brothers needs. \n\nAnd even now as an adult she is unable to spend some time with you alone, which she was very clear about. So of course she cancels the trip. \n\nIf you and your husband want any kind of deeper relationship with her, you should seriously consider to sit down with her and listen to her.
