Visits naturally became less frequent over time and she hasn't been home since last Christmas. Last week she called and asked if it would be okay for her to come home for a few days. We were thrilled. \n\nHowever, she said she would be staying at a hotel and would only like to see me and my husband at a restaurant outside. I was heartbroken that she didn't want to include Michael. I asked her to please visit us at home so she could see her brother as well. She is not having it.\n\nI asked her why she made this decision. She said she wanted a peaceful evening with her parents. I told her she needed to see her brother too since we're all a family and we need to stick together. Elizabeth told me to never mind, that she wasn't coming and that she made a mistake.\n\nI feel really bad for making her cancel the trip.

She'd have to rearrange her whole life revolve around him after you ensured her childhood centred around him. She'd have to push her own kids aside to focus on Michael, essentially doing to them what you've done to her. That's unfair and unreasonable. \n\nAll Elizabeth wanted was one dinner. Just one dinner where she had you and your husband to herself, where the focus was on her, and you couldn't even make that small effort. Nope, instead it once again became about Michael and how he just had to be there, how she had to put her wishes and wants aside for the sake of Michael, who you know you would have had to spend the entire dinner looking after. \n\nI'm going to put this bluntly: you have two children, not one. You need to remember that and act like it. Elizabeth is building a life without you because you've treated her like an afterthought. You missed her milestones, you're missing out on her life, and now you've shown you can't even show up for a single meal for her. I doubt you've apologised for any of it. I bet you've just demanded that she understand that because Michael is family and has the issues he does, she has to go without.

And then just to be punched in the gut by her mother who again put someone else's needs above her daughter's. \n\nOP's daughter, if you happen to find this post please know that it was a brave thing you did asking to spend time alone with your parents.

So far this has resulted in them having a phenomenal relationship, they both adore each other.

Autistic kids take more effort for sure but many are capable of functioning quite well in society and there\u2019s support networks out there if you know where to look. Usually when someone says sadly when referring to a diagnosis it\u2019s one of two things: someone\u2019s going to die or someone is disappointed.

Which means my guess about his disability was wrong and changes my view on why OP says he has occasional tantrums and is a lovely person. OP is hiding their disappointment which explains the word sadly being used and I definitely think his sister was likely going to be expected to care for him while she was there.\n\nAs someone who is Autistic this is really not ok.

OP never explained the degree to which their son's autism manifests itself and described him in joyful language initially, which would lead us, the readers, to interpret him as being more high functional and less stressful to deal with (so we end up wondering why her daughter doesn't want to be around her son). Then, OP describes the diagnosis as \"sadly\", which invariably would be offensive to high functioning autistic individuals because it invalidates people who do have autism but still live full and independent lives.\n\nBasically, OP didn't want to divulge how stressful her daughter's childhood was and how her daughter lost out on attention and was potentially parentified, because OP wanted us to believe it was unjust for OP's daughter to request time with her parents without her brother. But, this backfired as most people have logical thinking and can tell how difficult OP's daughter's childhood was, and OP has managed to offend high functioning autistic people by describing a diagnosis which is central to their existence, in the same vein someone would describe a cancer or dementia diagnosis."]}
