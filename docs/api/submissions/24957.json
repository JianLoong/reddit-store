I\u2019ve been having really complicated feelings about the whole thing, so when my wife and father both asked me what I want to do for my birthday I said \u201cnothing\u201d. And I truly meant it I\u2019m not like those passive aggressive people who say I want nothing and then get mad when nobody does anything. I\u2019m a parent to twin 1 year olds so a quiet day would genuinely be a gift. \n\nMy mom, however, told me \u201cI\u2019m holding a BBQ for your birthday on August 26, bring your wife and kids.\u201c I told my mom thank you but I really don\u2019t want this to be about my birthday. If she wants to do a family barbecue , just as a fun thing that\u2019s fine we\u2019ll participate but I don\u2019t want it to be about my birthday. No cake no presents. My mom got offended at this idea, insisting she wanted to celebrate me, so I reluctantly agreed.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. My dad texted me asking what kind of cake I wanted for my celebration this Saturday. I got confused and asked him to double check the date. He said mom invited him (they\u2019re divorced obvs) for this Saturday. I reached out to my mom to clear up the confusion. She said it was this Saturday. I reminded her she told me next Saturday and she argued with me. After a bit she got frustrated and admitted \u201c we have to do it this weekend, because that is when your cousin will be in town.\u201d Suddenly the truth dawned on me. the barbecue wasn\u2019t for me, it was so, my cousin could have a nice homecoming after being gone a few months. I was furious at this point, and said \u201cso you planned a birthday celebration without my consent, didn\u2019t consult me or my wife for what I actually wanted, and didn\u2019t ask me who I would like at this shindig, after not really doing anything for my birthday in nearly 10 years?\u201d She got flustered and said I\u2019m just trying to do something nice. I got mad and said \u201cwell, enjoy your barbecue with your nephew, because this party is not for me, it\u2019s for him. My family and I will not be attending. Thanks anyway.\u201d \n\nMy mom is really upset with me and is insisting she did this for my sake, and it\u2019s cold to just ignore her and everyone else who just wants to celebrate me. On the one hand maybe she is trying to do something nice for me, but on the other this reeks of her poor planning and her desire to make others happy regardless of my feelings. Am I crazy here? Is it selfish of me to tell my mom to cancel the party?\n\nEditing because this keeps coming up: I am not mad because the party isn\u2019t about me, I am mad because she clearly threw the event for my cousin, and decided last second \u201coh shit, it\u2019s my son\u2019s birthday, better toss that in too so I don\u2019t look bad.\u201d I feel like an afterthought at what was painted as a celebration for me. If she had told me from jump that it\u2019s a celebration for your cousin coming into town, I would\u2019ve been fine with that. IMO if you\u2019re going to celebrate someone\u2019s birthday, you should celebrate their birthday in a way they want, not what you want.", "created_utc": 1692379338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uqmhz/aita_for_cancelling_my_birthday_party/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He would have gone to the BBQ and had a great time celebrating his cousin.  But instead, the mom decided that doing that, even though it's what OP wants, would make her look bad since she's celebrating her nephew and not her son.  So she added her son's birthday to the nephew's party.  BUT she didn't tell OP, she just pressured him to let her give him a party - that he didn't want - until he agreed to it.  But she STILL didn't mention OP's cousin.  So OP would have shown up to a party he was pressured to have, only to find out he was an afterthought.  \n\nAnd I'm guessing this isn't the first time the mother has done something like this.  Specifically a) forcing OP to do something she wants even if he doesn't and b) treating him like an afterthought.", "I'm angry because she emotionally manipulated me into accepting a party, told me its to celebrate me without anything caveats or qualifications. Then it turns out it was never to celebrate me at all, it was to celebrate my cousin's home coming, and she tried to conceal that fact, and then gaslight me about it afterwards. \n\nI genuinely don't care that I haven't gotten a real celebration in years. I'm a grown up, and I don't need one. I would've rather the day passed with a simple \"Happy Birthday\" and maybe a card from my wife and kids. That's literally ALL I wanted. I know the party isn't about or for me, but she is still framing it that way to me and everyone else she invited, which means now I'm going to get the attention I didn't want at a celebration I did not ask for. And even if it was going to be a party to celebrate me, shouldn't I have been consulted about literally anything? Venue, food choice, guest list, anything? When I plan a party for someone, I take their input on literally everything, because it's \\*their\\* party.

I definitely agree that there\u2019s no way his mom hasn\u2019t done something like this before, and she never actually listened to anything he wanted.

I hope your translation/ guess is correct because that would make more sense. I understand being frustrated at his mom, but I still don\u2019t really understand why he\u2019s angry now. He claimed he didn\u2019t want to be thought of at all, so idk why he cares now that he discovered he\u2019s an afterthought. \n\nHis whole quoted conversation with his mom sounds very passive aggressive. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me who I would actually like at this shindig\u201d he didn\u2019t want it to be his party, so why does he care who she invites? He seems very torn on what he wanted for his birthday.", "Oh I wasn\u2019t arguing against your mom manipulating you. It absolutely is her own party with a \u201cyou themed coating\u201d. But you don\u2019t want the party, and already decided not to go. So why are you mad that you didn\u2019t get consulted on a party that you didn\u2019t want? Just don\u2019t go, and leave it alone? Just leave it at \u201cI didn\u2019t want a party\u201d. And now you\u2019re complaining about \u201cvenue, food, guest list\u201d about a party you want/ wanted nothing to do with.", "It absolutely can.\n\nLet me make my position clear: If this was just going to be a family barbecue? Great. Love it. If it was going to be a homecoming party for my cousin? Cool. I'll celebrate with the dude. If it was going to be a birthday party for me? Also fine, not crazy about it but if you insist I'll join. But if you're going to tell me \"It's a party for you\" when it's a party for someone else, and then don't even bother to take my thoughts and feelings into account or even tell me the right date? Then I'm pissed. It's not the actions, it's the framing and communication. Also, there's some bad history in there so I'm also kinda nursing old burns from her.", "Clearly you have a lifetime of baggage with your mom (who doesn't, believe me I get it). But that baggage is not conveyed by this specific post / situation and I stand by my judgment made with the knowledge provided.\n\nEveryone saying YTA is getting immediately downvoted into oblivion despite the subreddit's guidelines and entire purpose. Isn't the point to give opinions on subjective situations? \n\nI guess ultimately I'm not really sure why you're posting here when you seem extremely sure you are not the asshole.", "No, it's more like \"you didn't have to get me a gift, but thank you for it.\" and then having it snatched back and then saying \"psyche! not for you.\". Like I would've been happier if you never gave me the damn thing in the first place.", "Yeah you probably would have been happier without the gift in the first place. But you still are getting what you wanted, which was no gift. If you didn\u2019t even want it, why are you so angry she took it back? It\u2019s not really a tease unless you did want it.\n\nYour mom does sound very frustrating to deal with and she should have listened to you from the start. I agree with you not going. But I think you\u2019re still a lot more torn on the birthday subject than you claim to be. Otherwise this wouldn\u2019t be so complicated since the end result is in your favor.", "Did you even read the post? This is not about him. He never wanted it to be about him but his mother is making it about him to feel good about herself.\n\nMy birthday wish for the last 20 years has been to just forget about it and spend whatever resources are used for something more appropriate, because I could not give two Fs about my birthday and hate getting gifts and attention.\n\n That my family happens to meet on (or close to) my birthday every year for some bbq or just some social hang out where I can play with my niece and the dogs is completely fine with me and we all enjoy it. The week after when my sister has her birthday we do it again, with gifts and attention to her birthday and I get the same (or more) enjoyment from being there aswell. \n\nMy mother and family has adapted to my wish and we all enjoy it, but they know I wont accept any gifts and if they start singing happy birthday I will leave - we still have the best of times and the best and only birthday present I have gotten since I was 17 is a fistful of gravel from my toddler niece and a \"you welcome\" with a giant smile to my happy thank you. 10/10 will never forget that moment.\n\nThat is how you celebrate someone who does not want to be celebrated; by respecting their wishes.\n\nNTA."]}
