I\u2019ve been having really complicated feelings about the whole thing, so when my wife and father both asked me what I want to do for my birthday I said \u201cnothing\u201d. And I truly meant it I\u2019m not like those passive aggressive people who say I want nothing and then get mad when nobody does anything. I\u2019m a parent to twin 1 year olds so a quiet day would genuinely be a gift. \n\nMy mom, however, told me \u201cI\u2019m holding a BBQ for your birthday on August 26, bring your wife and kids.\u201c I told my mom thank you but I really don\u2019t want this to be about my birthday. If she wants to do a family barbecue , just as a fun thing that\u2019s fine we\u2019ll participate but I don\u2019t want it to be about my birthday. No cake no presents. My mom got offended at this idea, insisting she wanted to celebrate me, so I reluctantly agreed.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. My dad texted me asking what kind of cake I wanted for my celebration this Saturday. I got confused and asked him to double check the date. He said mom invited him (they\u2019re divorced obvs) for this Saturday. I reached out to my mom to clear up the confusion. She said it was this Saturday. I reminded her she told me next Saturday and she argued with me. After a bit she got frustrated and admitted \u201c we have to do it this weekend, because that is when your cousin will be in town.\u201d Suddenly the truth dawned on me. the barbecue wasn\u2019t for me, it was so, my cousin could have a nice homecoming after being gone a few months. I was furious at this point, and said \u201cso you planned a birthday celebration without my consent, didn\u2019t consult me or my wife for what I actually wanted, and didn\u2019t ask me who I would like at this shindig, after not really doing anything for my birthday in nearly 10 years?\u201d She got flustered and said I\u2019m just trying to do something nice. I got mad and said \u201cwell, enjoy your barbecue with your nephew, because this party is not for me, it\u2019s for him. My family and I will not be attending. Thanks anyway.\u201d \n\nMy mom is really upset with me and is insisting she did this for my sake, and it\u2019s cold to just ignore her and everyone else who just wants to celebrate me. On the one hand maybe she is trying to do something nice for me, but on the other this reeks of her poor planning and her desire to make others happy regardless of my feelings. Am I crazy here? Is it selfish of me to tell my mom to cancel the party?\n\nEditing because this keeps coming up: I am not mad because the party isn\u2019t about me, I am mad because she clearly threw the event for my cousin, and decided last second \u201coh shit, it\u2019s my son\u2019s birthday, better toss that in too so I don\u2019t look bad.\u201d I feel like an afterthought at what was painted as a celebration for me. If she had told me from jump that it\u2019s a celebration for your cousin coming into town, I would\u2019ve been fine with that. IMO if you\u2019re going to celebrate someone\u2019s birthday, you should celebrate their birthday in a way they want, not what you want.", "created_utc": 1692379338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uqmhz/aita_for_cancelling_my_birthday_party/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
