We met online, he moved to my country and left his family, apartment and job behind. He did everything to make our relationship work out. No matter how thankful I am for that, there always have been a few arguments about stuff that concerned me (ex girlfriend still in his life, texting edgy stuff to other girls etc.). Making him move in here, finding a job, car and proper life standards was not easy too. We were both stressed (I had many important exams at that time and was dealing with mental problems). \nOne day we had a really big argument, I don\u2019t want to go too much into the details. I basically found some explicit stuff from other girls on his phone and some spicy chats. I confronted him and he couldn\u2019t explain it much to me. At this time I felt really broken and hopeless, it took me a few days to come to the conclusion of wanting to break up with him. As we talked about it, things got out of control again and I ended up staying at my parents place for a while. \nHe must\u2019ve texted his mother about our argument and that I wanted to break up with him, I don\u2019t know what exactly they chatted about, but his mum ended up texting me on facebook, threatening me and insulting me in the worst way (I can\u2019t write that out on reddit the post would be banned). She was basically threatening me to end my life and called me out as a b\u2026ch. \nThis was a while ago, and my boyfriend and I are fine now, but his mother never apologized to me though. We just ignore any topic that\u2019s about her. \nHalf a year ago my boyfriend proposed to me, I said yes. We are planning our wedding now and we don\u2019t want a big wedding, only close friends and family.

What else will he be going to allow in the way of abuse towards you in the future?", "When you marry a man you are marrying his family as well.

You both have too many unresolved issues..", "NTA, an apology is a very small ask, and if your bf has really changed he should be explaining to his mother that he was in the wrong and that although he\u2019s grateful that she stood up for him with you, she was too hard on you and was out of line to get so involved. You can\u2019t be sure exactly what he told her about your argument at the time but I\u2019d take a guess that he made a big deal out of how he\u2019d given up everything to be with you and you then left him, and told her little or nothing about what he\u2019d done to cause the argument; so whilst death threats are a long way out of line, she might not have been acting on all the necessary information, and that might be why she\u2019s feeling so unforgiving.\n\nThat said: avoiding topics that are difficult to talk to and trying to sidestep all conversations about bad behaviour in one another and refusing to adhere to reasonable boundaries is a deeply unhealthy sign for your relationship. Your boyfriend isn\u2019t in the wrong for wanting his mother present on his wedding day but it seems like he is refusing to acknowledge his part in creating this situation and you have been for a long time letting that slide to keep the peace. Long term, that isn\u2019t going to work and you\u2019ll need to find more healthy ways to communicate and learn to hold one another accountable without getting into years-long fights about things that end up with some topics being off-limits until something big happens to force the issue.", "NTA. He is prioritizing his mom's feelings of anger and lack of ability to apologize over your feelings, this to me is a sign of what may be to come in the future, he may not ever out your feelings first before his mom's. I'm glad you were able to work through your previous problems however please ask yourself before it becomes years later and much harder to untangle from, do he prioritize your sense of security and well being or his mother's over yours? Is there a pattern of behavior you notice, would an apology from her truly make you feel more safe around  her?", "NTA She sounds awful. Boyfriend sounds awful for what amounts to cheating, not defending you, not standing up to his mom. You the least of all but also for doing this to yourself. You're NTA for wanting her to not attend but this is not a wedding to make happen at this point. This will be the rest of your life with this dynamic. Get it resolved first then a wedding. Or you will always be back seat and second choice in the family dynamic.
