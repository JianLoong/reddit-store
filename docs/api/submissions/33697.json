No your feelings are totally valid. It\u2019s your day and you should get to spend it how you want. Just keep in mind she was just trying to do something nice for you. 18 is a big age and she might feel like she\u2019s running out of opportunities to throw parties for you like this. Also you have a very good mindset about the whole thing you are obviously greatful. Honestly times like this are to cherish we don\u2019t know how many we\u2019ll ever have left.", "NTA. It's *your* bday! Your mom is TA for making your special day all about her preferences, and guilt-tripping you about something *she* insisted on doing.", "NTA. she made YOUR birthday all about what SHE thinks should be done. And ruined it for you. Of course you are not grateful - why should you be grateful for a ruined day?", "NTA. You *are* ungrateful for what she's trying to do. What she's trying to do is far from what you want her to do. If you could just tell her \"Don't do anything.\" and she listened and didn't do anything, you'd be perfectly happy.\n\nShe's doing what she believes is the right thing because it's what she's always done. She doesn't accept that you're older and may not want the same things. She got the party she wanted; you got the party you didn't want. Plus you had to work for it on your birthday.
