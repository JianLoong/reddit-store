Does she want you to spend every one of those days with her?  From what you describe, you're prioritizing her, your mental health, and making time to spend with friends. \nEnjoy your time off, OP!", "NTA- it\u2019s your annual leave to do with as you wish. She sounds very controlling about your personal time. An 8 day holiday would be seen as a luxury to most people and she is throwing hissy fits over you spending a couple days here and there with your friends. She is not entitled to 100% of your time. We have friends, families and partners over the course of our lives and a single person, no matter the connection, does not get to dictate who you see and how much time you allot them.", "NTA\n\n\"Not using it on us\" . Uhhh what? Its your time. Youre allowed to do stuff without her attached to the hip.", "NTA and this is some serious red flag shit. In a relationship you still get to have you time to do things without your SO. Especially with such generous leave time it sounds like you are using 8-10 days with her and 2 days to see friends.", "That's some micromanaging of your leave she's doing there, especially since you just spent Easter together.\n\nDon't think you're TAH. Is this a pattern you're seeing from your gf, where she tries to block you going away alone/seeing other friends (ie not her friends)/prefers it to be just the two of you?\n\nIf so, that's not healthy.\n\nNTA", "I wont put in a verdict (yet). Future time off aside. There is something you two need to talk about as there is something bothering her. I think you should ask your girlfriend if there is something she wants to talk about. Use this situation as a lead-in. Ask her if there is something she is struggling with lately. Ask her about her mental state. Is she ok? How is her mental headspace?\n\nThe TA or not. Thats irrelevant. Dont focus on winning this \"battle\". There might be a deeper meaning. It reads like there is..\n\nShe can be a bit jealous of your extra time. But thats a 'symptom'. It can mean she feels stressed. Perhaps she needs quality time to battle that. Or she can feel like you are not giving her the (right) attention she feels she needs/deserves.\n\nThe only way to know is to not ask the internet for a verdict on this one instance, but to talk it through with her.", "NTA. It\u2019s your leave and friendships are important.", "NTA. Everyone needs time for themselves and to spend time with friends rather than just with your SO. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s part of a particularly healthy relationship to not appreciate time spent apart.", "NTA.\n\n>She said I'm not prioritising the relationship by using it all on myself\n\nYou clearly aren't doing this.", "NTA she is being controlling and manipulative. Put it into percentages and explain it that way to her, sounds like you gotta break it down for this one!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can do what you want with it.", "NTA - you work to live not live to work so you have every right to use your annual leave how you want.\n\n Also your gf complaining about you using leave despite having plenty still left over and you two have a holiday booked plus some weekends is a bit of a red flag tbh as it's your leave not hers at the end of the day + some couples get nowhere near this level of time off in a year so her expecting you to dedicate all your time off to her and the relationship is very self centered.", "As far as work goes, your AL is there provide a restorative work-life balance.\n\nSeeing friends is a great use of time! It's wonderful for your wellbeing!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your girlfriend sounds like the type that would make rabbit stew with a live rabbit.\n\nGet out while she\u2019s a GF and not a fianc\u00e9, OP!", "NTA. She sounds needy and selfish and controlling. You haven't seen these friends in over 2 years and you're using up a fraction of your time off to see them and that's a problem for her?? I would use the rest of my time off to find a new GF who isn't like this", "NTA, also fellow Brit here, ultimately my annual leave is for me so I get final say on how I use it. I\u2019ve used some of my annual leave this weekend for the bank holiday. Also have 30 days paid annual leave plus paid bank holidays. I\u2019m going go out the pub tonight and then doing nothing for the rest of the weekend plus the days I\u2019ve booked off next week. \n\nI\u2019m also going to multiple festivals this year with my friends and used my Annual Leave for the Fridays and Mondays before and after the festival so I can spend some time with them. \n\nUse your annual leave however to want to. Some days you just need off to do nothing.", "I agree with this, but it could also mean that she's trying to isolate him from his friends and be just 'the couple'. Impossible to know from this post. Talking about it is definitely the way to go."]}
