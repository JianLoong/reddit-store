I have been pretty indepedant for ten years now: own my flat, am in a stable relationship etc... I've always worked very hard by myself, and if my parents supported me, they always told me that they did not think I would succeed. I've been lucky enough to enter two very prestigious universities, despite my insecurities.\n\nMy brother (26M) is the polar opposite. He still lives home and does not contribute despite being in apprenticeship and earning more money than I do. My mum and dad do his laundry, clean his room, prepare his meals (each night and also the one he needs during the workday), help him with his car (he practices racing which is expensive), and land him money to get a new one. Everything he is doing, my parents did it for him. They found him his apprenticeship, asking for him, they did his cover letters, they filled application forms. So now he is basically a bachelor, explaining \"so fun I can go this far by doing nothing.\" He'll work in construction.\n\nHere is the problem. He has a master's thesis to write this year. And does not want to. He says it's too complicated for him. He never even tried. So my mum is doing part of it, spending her evening on it and wants me to contribute to the other part. I'm kind of pissed since it's like 100 hours of unpaid work, that they always ask me when I have a ton of work (but since it's on my computer fuck it, it's not real work), I'm sick of this dynamic where he gets everything he wants and never even asks (he asked my parents to ask me instead, never text or anything), does not even read what I do for him (one day I had to make a cover letter - while I was working ofc - and I left blank where I missed data, tell him to fill the gap but he sent it like this and my parents were pissed about me.\n\nI just spent 300 bucks to get back home for a week holiday, and it's back again with that thesis. If I say no, my parents tell me that it's awful that I don't help my brother to get a better life. And that I should at least do it for my mum, who is spending a lot of time writing it. Parents think I'm reluctant because I'm jealous and bitter, and it's true, maybe I am. What should I do?\n\nHe will be hired full-time in his company, even if he does not finish his master's thesis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I listened to you all. I had a discussion with my parents and said that I would stop doing stuff for my brother.\n\nI told my mother, that it was fraud. It's dangerous. And it's also taking a toll on her mental health because she is spending a lot of hours on this master's thesis (while she has no previous knowledge of the field and she never has been to the uni). She says \"She loves to help\", but it's not help. I can't do anything more since she does not understand that.\n\nMy dad was annoying. He, again, blamed me for a traffic fine my brother had two years ago. (Because I was in the car with two friends of mine). I decided to take a step back and will spend the rest of my week seeing my childhood friends around.\n\nI'm sick of the toxic traits of my brother, and the fact that my parents enable it. I think I'm going NC with him and if my parents want to see me, they can still come and visit where I live.\n\nI won't report him because I don't want to start a war, but I hope one day it'll backfire on him and he will stop acting like my parents are his slaves.

Asked someone to do my assignments for me.  Heck, sometimes I would have to tell my mom that no, I didn't need someone to read over a paper.
