I have been pretty indepedant for ten years now: own my flat, am in a stable relationship etc... I've always worked very hard by myself, and if my parents supported me, they always told me that they did not think I would succeed. I've been lucky enough to enter two very prestigious universities, despite my insecurities.\n\nMy brother (26M) is the polar opposite. He still lives home and does not contribute despite being in apprenticeship and earning more money than I do. My mum and dad do his laundry, clean his room, prepare his meals (each night and also the one he needs during the workday), help him with his car (he practices racing which is expensive), and land him money to get a new one. Everything he is doing, my parents did it for him. They found him his apprenticeship, asking for him, they did his cover letters, they filled application forms. So now he is basically a bachelor, explaining \"so fun I can go this far by doing nothing.\" He'll work in construction.\n\nHere is the problem. He has a master's thesis to write this year. And does not want to. He says it's too complicated for him. He never even tried. So my mum is doing part of it, spending her evening on it and wants me to contribute to the other part. I'm kind of pissed since it's like 100 hours of unpaid work, that they always ask me when I have a ton of work (but since it's on my computer fuck it, it's not real work), I'm sick of this dynamic where he gets everything he wants and never even asks (he asked my parents to ask me instead, never text or anything), does not even read what I do for him (one day I had to make a cover letter - while I was working ofc - and I left blank where I missed data, tell him to fill the gap but he sent it like this and my parents were pissed about me.\n\nI just spent 300 bucks to get back home for a week holiday, and it's back again with that thesis. If I say no, my parents tell me that it's awful that I don't help my brother to get a better life. And that I should at least do it for my mum, who is spending a lot of time writing it. Parents think I'm reluctant because I'm jealous and bitter, and it's true, maybe I am. What should I do?\n\nHe will be hired full-time in his company, even if he does not finish his master's thesis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I listened to you all. I had a discussion with my parents and said that I would stop doing stuff for my brother.\n\nI told my mother, that it was fraud. It's dangerous. And it's also taking a toll on her mental health because she is spending a lot of hours on this master's thesis (while she has no previous knowledge of the field and she never has been to the uni). She says \"She loves to help\", but it's not help. I can't do anything more since she does not understand that.\n\nMy dad was annoying. He, again, blamed me for a traffic fine my brother had two years ago. (Because I was in the car with two friends of mine). I decided to take a step back and will spend the rest of my week seeing my childhood friends around.\n\nI'm sick of the toxic traits of my brother, and the fact that my parents enable it. I think I'm going NC with him and if my parents want to see me, they can still come and visit where I live.\n\nI won't report him because I don't want to start a war, but I hope one day it'll backfire on him and he will stop acting like my parents are his slaves.

Asked someone to do my assignments for me.  Heck, sometimes I would have to tell my mom that no, I didn't need someone to read over a paper.

But, it's my money, not theirs. \n\nMaybe another point is that: he is entitled to treat them like shit. What he asks, he gets and it's working. Blaming my parents because they are not rich enough so it's complicated for him to do car racing, while they pay for everything.

We went to the same high school and went to the same bigger city to begin our studies. I decided to pursue it in bigger cities, mainly because there are few universities in my field.\n\nMaybe it will be clearer if I tell you that we live in Europe, in a country where some masters have an apprenticeship option.  (I did one too' during my master's). Maybe we call it, coop training? \n\nAnd about the differences in our situation: I chose a career path where there are not a lot of work opportunities, and where the salaries are super bad: journalism, and then shifted to documentary making, where you win even less. I'm doing another diploma this year, in a school that has classes for adults who already work in the industry. It's the only one in my country and they select only twelve of us each year so I'm super excited to go, but need to keep working on the side. \n\nHis apprenticeship is in the construction field, public work, and it's very well-paid while he is still living with my parents (who got him the job, and the schools to raise in the company, he began as a truck driver). \n\nIt works well for both of us, since I'm super happy with my job and would never trade, and I get enough money to live, no problem about that.", "Enjoy your downvotes because this is an absolutely insane take.", "> Help with the thesis\n\nThis is academic fraud, my friend.", "> fault.

That's academic dishonesty and can and should lead to the brother being kicked out of his program.", "Master thesis\\* which is not the same than doctorate.

Don't you mean \"*We*\" are doing?!!! You are equally enabling the situation.\n\nPut them all on mute and don't do it...ever again. Honestly your family sounds like they barely throw you a loving bone, yet you dance to their manipulative tune!", "Seriously op the only way you would be the ahole is if you help your brother commit fraud here, honestly if i was in your shoes i would be tempted to send an anonymous email to your brothers uni telling them of fraud issues with his work but then again i come from a family of academics and would be crucified if i help someone plagiarize even a small essay. \n\nAlso your parents have utterly infantilized your brother and its only going to hurt him his whole life afterall are they going to do his work for him for a job he gets thx to having a masters? what about if he ever has to present it in a meeting he will be incapable of things that are basic skill he was meant to develop at uni because of your parents.", "A cover letter isn't academic, it's for a job application.

I was following the path they had for me and I was miserable.

Distance yourself, and focus on you a bit more.", "It sounds like he is the Golden Child and can do no wrong, and that would make you the Scapegoat, and can do no right. Your family seems to have an unhealthy dynamic where your parents favor him, so they will do anything and everything for him if need be.  \n\n\nIt is funny to me how your parents constantly belittled you, but now are expecting you to do the work for someone who they think of as \"better\". Shouldn't he do his own work if he is so destined to succeed? If he is so smart and so good, won't whatever he writes be good, too?", "Sounds like you're enabling all of this. Is there a reason you are incapable of saying no? It's on you at this point.\n\nThe sooner you stop, the sooner they'll get angry, get over it, and stop asking you.", "I have kids in grad school and would never do this it's not being helpful", "Again, I would simply contact the university and report them anonymously, they are not going to change.", "It sounds like your mother is a little loopy.

How has he helped you that you would throw away your morals (and your hard work) by helping him cheat? Academic dishonesty pulls away from YOUR work.

She was the one suffering because she was parentified and basically had to raise her two brothers and one sister. She was the one who had different rules than her brother because she was a woman. She was the one caring for my grandparents while her brother (who is still not fucking autonomous) where still asking my dying grandmother to do their laundry. Her two brothers have really fucked up life because they were golden children and a ton of social issues, but she can't help herself to do the same for her son? \n\nConcerning my brother, helping me? He neither speaks to me. Each time I try to ask him about his day, he brushes me off (it's \"his\" temper) according to my parents.

I am still working on my self-esteem though but I made very big progress :)\n\nIf you want to be happy and feel free, you have to let it go.
