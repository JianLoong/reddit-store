People who are uncomfortable with nudity should not go to places where nudity is allowed.", "I'm going to go with NAH. but to preface: your sister's insecurities should never dictate your comfortability with your own body!!\n\nIf you're from a place where nude or topless beaches aren't as common, most people will have different thoughts about it. Nude beaches are in my area, but are still a little more \"taboo\" to a lot of people. I feel like I could be topless at a beach with my SO, best friend or sister. but my brother in law would not want me to be topless around him, he is very reserved (but incredibly kind!). I would NEVER be topless around my best friend's husband. He's a creep and I wouldn't feel comfortable around him. I'm assuming my sister or best friend would ask me if I felt comfortable with them being topless around my SO. Which I honestly don't know if I would. Stranger's tits are different than tits that come over for dinner, I think lol (again, this is based on the way I was raised. I have absolutely no issue with others doing what's comfortable for them!!) but you guys had already discussed going topless so yeah, I see why you would just go for it. I'm assuming she thought you guys would do it without your husbands' there? But that's not your fault for not assuming that's what she meant. \n\nI see both sides of it. Hopefully you guys can laugh this off before long", "Why did she decide to stop by a nude beach if she got so offended? I get her point, I wouldn't feel comfortable to be nude in front of my family, the only times I did it was when noone knew me. But why even go there if that was her reaction? She should say she is not comfortable. Doesn't sound like anyone was particularly pressed to go there anyway, so it wouldn't be a big deal if you skipped it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s a ***nude beach***, not a prude beach. She didn\u2019t have to strip down, but she absolutely has no right to shame you for doing it. Especially with the encouragement of your husband! If she was *that* uncomfortable, she shouldn\u2019t have gone to that beach. That\u2019s like going to a restaurant and getting mad that someone ordered a burger while you\u2019re on a diet.\n\nWas she going to give dirty looks to everyone nude there, or is this solely because YOU did it? Because either way, she\u2019s being obtuse. She\u2019s also ruining her own vacation. I\u2019d honestly ignore her if she\u2019s ruining it for you too. Go have fun, let her be unhappy on her own.", "NTA. If she is uncomfortable with nudity she should not be going to a nude beach, it isn't like you stripped down at a family BBQ.", "NTA.\n\nIf there\u2019s ever an appropriate situation for being topless in front of your brother in law it is sunbathing at a nude beach that everyone, INCLUDING YOUR SISTER, agreed to go to.\n\nYou were literally at a nude beach. What the fuck did she think would happen here????", "NTA. Free the nipple.   \n\n\n**Your body, your choice.** Your sister does NOT get to police your... shall we say... beach fashion choices ... simply because she's insecure about her own body.", "I think ESH... sure it's fine to do, but in front of your sisters husband...? that just seems so inappropriate to me. Just because you can, doesn't mean you SHOULD...", "NTA\n\nWhy would she go to a nude friendly beach and expect you to keep your clothes on? That is just madness.", "4 of u. All human all equal.\n\nWhether it was one of four or three of four, they removed their tops in order to enjoy the sun\u2019s warms. This is entirely not your problem.  \n\nAnd she knows it . \n\nSo if two brothers go out and one has a big belly & the other doesn\u2019t he\u2019s gonna get pissed off that his brother took off his shirt to go swimming or something? Ridiculous. \n\nI understand the emotive reaction because she\u2019s so insecure but ridiculous, irrational, and emotionally immature to impose on you .", "NAH. But, I do think it\u2019s kind of weird that you felt comfortable taking your top and skirt off to tan in just a thong in front of your brother in law. Personally, it\u2019s not something I would have done. It has the potential to create issues and weird dynamics. You may have made things awkward between you and your sister but also him. He\u2019s now seen you almost naked and that may have created an issue for your sister. In her mind, she hates her body and now her husband has seen her sister\u2019s almost naked body. She probably can\u2019t get it out of her head that he might be attracted to you now. You\u2019re not an AH because you have the right to do what you choose with your own body, but have a little sympathy for your sister and understand that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with you doing that in front of her husband.", "NAH - It sounds like there was a miscommunication between you and your sister about comfort levels, but it wasn't intentional, and everyone's feelings are valid", "ESH \n\nI say this for two reasons \n\n1. Her issues with her body have nothing to do with you and shouldn't stop you from feeling comfortable in your own skin. So I don't know why she would try to shake you because she doesn't feel good in her own skin. \n\n2.While we are all about freedom to do with our bodies as we please, there is a certain level of respect we hold for each other and each others spouses. I don't think the respect for her spouse was met here. There should have been a prior discussion about her comfortability with you being naked in front of her spouse. Specifically int hat context. \n\nI mean I'm not as comfortable in my skin as my lil sis too but we joke about doing nude beaches etc but the respect level we have for each other and our partners means neither of us regardless of where we are would ever get naked Infront of the others spouse. But we as sisters would 100%  get naked Infront of each other and streak down the street if we wanted, but never infront if each others partners. \n\n She was probably joking about it with you, with the intention of doing it only with you. Not with your spouses present.", "If i care about someone and notice they\u2019re uncomfortable I ask and try to make them feel comfortable. That\u2019s all. The vast majority of women around the world wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with what op did. It doesn\u2019t matter if you think it\u2019s ridiculous or not. Sister was uncomfortable with something most people would be uncomfortable with, op disregarded that.", "YTA - why not run it by her first? Joking doesn\u2019t mean she was comfortable with a relative getting naked, especially in front of a husband. At the end of the day, they\u2019re just tits, but you should\u2019ve asked the rest of the party accompanying you. Not cool", "Weird uncomfortable comment. I\u2019m all for nudity, but I can empathise with your sister. I feel like going clothed to a nude beach and taking off your shirt is kind of weird and if I was using the beach and guys turned up in clothes and just took their shirts off it would feel pervy. \n\nLikewise you weren\u2019t all in bathing suits. You just stripped down from clothing, so your sister was unprepared for that. I\u2019m not articulating this well, but that feels weird. Why it mentally feels different to take off a cover up and a bikini top, as opposed to taking off a shirt and bra. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why, but I get your sister on this one.", "This has nothing to do with it being a nudest beach or the sister being a prude  it has everything to do with her getting  naked in front of the sisters husband", "Not completely the asshole but you probably should have just told them you were going to get undressed.  I'm guessing you don't come from a culture where nudity is common, being on holiday doesn't change that. A little communication could have prevented this and your sister and her husband could have gone on  a walk before you got naked if she had been uncomfortable.", "I'm going with NAH. Being on a nude-acceptible beach, you were perfectly in your rights to go nude. However, I think you're completely blind to what your sister is feeling. She gave you a hint, but only part of the equation. She's not comfortable with her own body, AND she wasn't comfortable with her decade-younger sister baring her tits to her husband. She's not going to come right out and say it, but she'll be concerned in the future every time her husband is around you now.\n\nWhile none of this should be used to control you and your body, try to at least have a little empathy.", "YTA. People just have no boundaries.  It is is one thing if it were you and your husband alone but why are you showing off your breasts around your BIL. I knew your sister wouldn't be happy before you even did it. I don't understand how you couldn't see this as a problem.", "The world has gone crazy. Don't show your brother in law you tits in thong and Mauritius doesn't have nude beaches.", "Weeeelll I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an AH but maybe in your sister\u2019s head the plan was to go with you only to tan the titties.. personally I wouldn\u2019t free the nip in front of my BIL but that\u2019s me I guess\u2026", "NTA.

She should get some help for that. Nta", "What I can\u2019t move past is why would you feel comfortable being in just a thong in front of your sister\u2019s husband? I can\u2019t think of anything more uncomfortable.", "Hates her body, goes to a nude beach. Yeah.", "Alright, imma play devils advocate with everyone in the comments, even at risk of getting downvoted. I agree it\u2019s your body, do whatever you want, but if you knew she felt uncomfortable with her body, why would you strip nude and leave her to be by herself? Especially in front of her husband. I mean, I get free choice, but I can completely get where the sister is coming from. I\u2019ll just say ESH.", "NTA. Your sister seems to be the one with a problem, not you.", "YTA. \n\nWhen joking (which you acknowledge were jokes) about going to the nude beach did those plans include your husbands? Probably not. \n\nYou took it upon yourself to strip down to your panties in front of your BIL at the nude friendly beach. She is deciding to now put distance between the two of you because she no longer trusts you because of your actions. \n\nWhether or not you\u2019re technically allowed to be naked isn\u2019t really the issue for her. The fact that you assumed to do so in front of her spouse probably is. I hope this doesn\u2019t damage your relationship forever but that\u2019s what happens sometimes.", "NTA. Your sister shouldn\u2019t be offended when her husband is around some boobs at a nude beach. Especially when he has his out.", "I\u2019m gonna have to go against the grain and say YTA. I\u2019m sorry but y\u2019all joked about going as you two girls. I could never just strip in front of a sister or best friend\u2019s husband. It feels \u2026 wrong. If it was just you two then that\u2019s very different. But it\u2019s you two and your *husbands*. Which means your brother in law has now seen you naked. I\u2019m sorry but not cool. That should\u2019ve been a girls only activity. Let them go golf or something\n\nEdit to add ESH. My original YTA vote and reasoning still stands but I will for sure add that the sister is also a bit of an AH for her comment about \u201cyou know I\u2019m insecure about my body\u201d. Just because she\u2019s insecure doesn\u2019t mean she should project that onto OP and try to shame her for being comfortable in her skin.

Her sister on the other hand has no confidence in herself and does not trust her own husband.", "Same", "Mine too. Is wasn't just her breasts on display. She was in a thong, practically naked.  And it wasn't a nudist beach either.", "Is that what people are doing when there are toilets on their lawn? Should I be allowing my toilet to sun bathe? Is there a benefit? Does it just need to touch grass occasionally? \n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m apparently a child that couldn\u2019t just pass up that autocorrect.", "Some ppls sisters are their besties .", "No, I have no interest in seeing nude strangers. No, I have no desire to see my father, mother or brothers naked. When I think about the things that nudity is absolutely necessary for like, bathing, sexual encounters, birth, dependent healthcare, going to the bathroom, etc. those all carry a significant level of privacy, vulnerability and intimacy. If being nude is so normal and acceptable, then why do we have bathroom stalls? Why not just take a crap in front of everyone? And why separate gender showers in places like prisons or gyms? Let everyone shower openly and freely with all hanging out. See, if nudity is acceptable on beaches, in front of your brother in law, father and whoever else - then all activities where nudity is necessary, should be seen as openly accessible to the public. And to anyone who feels uneasy about it, shame on them and their modesty.", "The problem is that beautiful strangers he'll see at a beach once is different from seeing her sister at gatherings for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe sister feels insecure about her body, and it's implied that she feels like she doesn't measure up to her sister, the topless one in her thong underwear. \n\nWhen they were joking about topless sunbathing, she should have told OP that she'd feel embarrassed about her own body if OP took her top off in front of her husband. Or she should have communicated better in the moment.\n\nHowever, insecurity about your own body is a strong shame and embarrassment, and a lot of women don't talk about it, feel like they're wrong for having those opinions, or might not even understand what exactly they want in the moment. \n\nWe women are bombarded with gorgeous, airbrushed, photoshopped, and filtered women from every angle - social media, Youtube, IG, magazines, and other online sources. They all seem to be thin, toned, and gorgeous. A lot of them look nothing like that in person. The message is, if you're not in your twenties, gorgeous, and thin, then you're unworthy. Men and women each have their individual pressures, but body issues are so common with women. \n\nIt's not OP's fault, and her sister did not communicate what was going on the right way. She appears to have the usual body image issues so common in women. They need to just sit down and talk about it.", "your partner seeing the breasts of your sibling is not the same as seeing a stranger\u2019s\n\n( like having a partner who watches porn is okay for some people but if the partner signed up for a close friend\u2019s OF would not be okay)", "They said \"on holiday\" so idk how they sound like North americans?!?", "Haha! \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude48 \n\nYou saying toilet sunbathing is not something everyone does?!?!", "The men were topless already.\n\nYou know what some (lots of) women are into? Guys with nice chests and nice stomachs/abs. If OPs husband had his shirt off how does OP not know her sister isn't sitting there licking her lips and getting wet to OPs husband? She doesn't know, but she isn't worried about it because she's confident and trusts her family.", "That's true across Canada thanks to women in the 90s.  Nude beaches everywhere I've been are kinda on a hearsay basis unless you happen upon one.  I mean there's not like huge signage, you just go find the naked people and join em lol.  I think it's cool", "Well written.\n\nI meant to actually vote Nobody's The Asshole but I forgot how to say that.\n\nI have a lot of empathy for the sister too:\n\n1) working through body issues\n2) OP is relatively younger than her\n3) OP's sister would have insecurities in the bedroom due to body issues and her sexual partner is present\n3A) the husbands are closer in age than the sisters are\n4) OP's husband makes a \"for the boys\" type comment right before OP unclothed\n5) what kind of sister misreads a joke that badly, I can't imagine fucking up like that on reading my siblings \n\nThere's a lot of reasons to feel for the sister.  She's not a bad person either and OP honestly just took her top off after maybe misreading a joke.  Just wish the communication was better but isn't that life?", "Thanks for the correction & the laugh!", "Ok I need people to stop being hilarious on here!", "Reddit is mostly American and that\u2019s unfortunately the American puritanistic culture. If Reddit was all French you\u2019d see none of these responses here.", "I disagree. I was on topless on a nude friendly beach in Greece with my bf. A German family was near us and the husband keep glancing at me, trying to be discreet but failing miserably. Btw, I live in Germany and a couple of my German friends will pop on their sunglasses and talk about the nude people on the beach. Mostly making jokes about them. A friend even said she wanted to go to a spa with me because she was curious how I look naked. One time I went to a swimming pool with a Scandinavian friend and she seemed very interested in looking at me in the shower after our swim when she didn't think I was looking. Yes, everyone likes to say it's normal but if you scratch a little further they are not quite as nonchalant as you think.\n\nIt's okay if people want to let it all hang out, but personally I feel a bit vulnerable that people are scrutinising me and it makes me uneasy. Therefore I choose not to go naked in front of some people.\n\nAbout OP, I have 2 sisters. 1 has an eating disorders and is too thin. The other is overweight. I am slim and I get compliments for looking fit. I know my sisters would feel insecure if I took my top off in front of their partners and I don't want them to feel like that. I want to enjoy the time with them which means we all feel secure with each other. I think either you don't know your sister well, or you don't really care how she may feel. She's not enjoying the experience the way you are.", "Nobody is angry because you are a Canadian \ud83e\udd23", "Body dysmorphia has been around for a long, long time", "Yes exactly!\n\nIt would almost be equally awkward if people at a nude beach completely refused to look at each other. If you were pointedly  staring at the floor you'd be colliding with things and people as a consequence.", "Yep, you just accept that that particular woman got a bad vibe and you didn't mean to send it and then move on.  It's the fact that women have to be on their guard, so I don't take it personally.  I just y'know do my best, move away from her if I can so I won't seem like I'm trying again, nothing huge, but a small display of mindfulness of the situation.  You're right, the truth in those situations is absolutely unbelievable and there's no reason to argue it either.  The only thing creepier than accidentally creeping that a well or at least neutrally intentioned man could do is argue that he didn't mean to stare..."]}
