You could always open the door by asking to chat and saying something like \"I don't want you to feel like you were responsible for my relapse and maybe you didn't know about my eating disorder when you were complimenting my weight loss... But I had to say something because your comments were triggering. Now that you know everything I'd love to start fresh.\" Or something like that.", "Nta I will never understand why people have to comment on weight stuff about other people. You could be sick, or maybe not have enough $ for food. Like it\u2019s not always a good thing", "NTA. You asked her to stop a behavior that was negatively affecting you, and you explained why. It's not your fault that she's upset, any more than it's her fault you have an eating disorder. \n\nI think if I were in your position I'd offer a non-apology just to make peace. \n\n* \"I'm sorry it upset you to hear about my eating disorder.\" \n* \"I'm sorry I called your compliment game lazy.\"\n* \"I heard you were upset so I wanted to make sure you know you didn't cause this, but your comments did make it worse.\" \n* \"I'm sorry diet culture got you too.\"", "NTA, I lost a lot of weight after a breakup, I was already thin and people were like \u2018oh you are so skinny, I wish I had your discipline\u2019 and so on.  This was 25 years ago and I still remember the kindest comment I received was \u2018Hey, I see you are going through something if you ever need someone to talk to I am here for you.\u2019  This wasn\u2019t a good friend just a work colleague but \u2018wow\u2019 I will never forget that.", "NTA I lost a heap of weight as I was trying to divorce my husband. Everyone told me how amazing I looked. I didn\u2019t feel amazing, I felt shit. Then when I finally told everyone i had left him, they wanted to know why. And once i was out, i put weight back on and people said oh that\u2019s a shame, you were looking good. So apparently you look good when you are suicidal and it\u2019s a pity you can\u2019t stay that way. Just cause people get embarrassed at the stupid shit they say, without knowing the circumstances, doesn\u2019t mean you owe them anything.", "NTA. I too have an ED that's greatly affected when people comment on my weight. People need to stop complimenting people they don't know about their weight loss, it's inappropriate and kinda gross.", "NTA I\u2019ve been both obese and super skinny after wls. The amount of people who think it\u2019s their right to comment on weight loss is insane. I never ever had a comment when I was obese but now I\u2019m am struggling to keep weight on, every Tom dick and harry think they have a right to an opinion for me", "NTA. You did what you needed to do for your own mental health by bringing her up to speed on exactly why this is not appropriate these days. \n\nTo answer everyone's question, some people think this is okay either because they are from a generation where being thin was great regardless of how they got there or because they spend a lot of time with people from that generation and don't understand it is not the norm. A mere ten years ago, people were doing messed up shit like congratulating each other on weight loss caused by the stomach flu. \n\nThings have changed drastically in how we go about weight loss and how we view it. She probably did feel genuinely bad for not knowing, but hopefully, this spared others the discomfort of her comments.", "NAH. She was trying to be kind and weight is probably a struggle for her in a different way. You told her she was making you worse, which isn\u2019t really fair. \n\nAlso, she presumably was saying these comments to you in private (assuming since none of your coworkers who know about your illness told her to back off), which seems to indicate she was trying to be thoughtful about how she commented to you. \n\nObviously she didn\u2019t know your history, and you were right to tell her to stop, however, she\u2019s not TA either for what she intended to be a praise. She deserves the benefit of the doubt, just as you deserve to not have your illness brought to attention by simple ignorance.", "NTA. Apologizing isn\u2019t necessary but definitely a talk with her that your mental health isn\u2019t her fault but she seriously needs to zip it with the weight talk. Especially in a hospital where weight loss is usually a sign something is wrong.", "NTA for what you said and no, you shouldn't broach the topic again to apologise or otherwise. It's ok for her to feel bad. It's upto her to work through her feelings. Idk why so many people feel that anyone feeling \"bad\" must be coddled immediately. Feeling bad for doing something wrong or sticking your foot in your mouth even if you didn't have malicious intentions *is ok*. As humans we are supposed to be able to work through our negative emotions as well.", "NTA. That's a valid boundary to set. I never understand why commenting on a co-worker's weight is something so many people think is ok.", "NTA obviously. Your weight is your business and she should stay out of it.", "NAH. Weight is probably a big struggle for her too. You aren\u2019t an AH but you probably could have said it in a more gentle tone, like \u201chey just so you know, I actually struggle with this, would you mind not mentioning it? Thanks\u201d", "Nah. Truth is while people should not comment on others bodies, we are still programmed to think it is a compliment. \n\nYou don't have to do anything but your CW is not an ahole for this.", "NTA\n\nShe did/said something you didn't like, so you asked her to stop. Now she is upset?? Oh my goodness....I cannot believe a grown adult can be so sensitive to being told to stop doing something. How old is she, 5?\n\nYou are not responsible for how she perceives things. And saying you have an eating disorder is enough explaining. Don't go apologising for whatever she may think she has done.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReport your coworker for making inappropriate commet sbaout your body. She needs to stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU have nothing to apologize for.", "NTA. Commenting on the weight loss of a co - worker you barely know is just not a good thing to do. If someone mentioned they're on a diet, cool, compliment them. But if you don't know they were actively trying to lose weight, keep your thoughts about it to yourself.", "NTA, but with a caveat. If she didn't know about your disorder you probably could have approached it differently.", "NTA\n\nIt's about time she learns to not comment on people's weight.", "I\u2019d say a very gentle YTA. \n\nWhile your eating disorder is entirely not her business, I am sure she was saying these things without malice. She thought she was giving a compliment. \n\nThe best course of action would have been to in private ask her to stop making comments on your weight because it makes you uncomfortable. If she continues to talk about it after that then that is entirely on her. \n\nI only put this more on you because it seems like you went on the attack without giving her an opportunity to correct something she didn\u2019t know she was doing wrong.", "I am going to say yes, YTA\n\nShe was new. Didn't know about your disorder. Typically, people are happy to hear weight loss compliments.", "YTA. Most women like to be complimented when they change something. Hair, weight loss, new nails, etc. She genuinely thought she was complimenting your efforts to lose weight and instead of saying \u201cI\u2019m fighting an eating disorder\u201d you actually blamed her for making it worse. Yea, Youre definitely an AH.", "If you literally said to someone \"I have an eating disorder and you are making it worse.\" then of course they would feel responsible, you've actually told them that they are.\n\nIf they're a healthcare worker I'm a bit concerned by them, though. Like if any person should know better than to assume rapid weightloss is a good thing...??? On top of: commenting on colleague's bodies in the workplace? Because it was a \"compliment\" it was assumed that was okay?\n\nI think the \"you should apologise\" opinion is coming from when you said it and how you said it.\\* You had an opportunity to draw a clear boundary the first time, the second time, the third time... I assume that she was trying to be \"friendly/nice\" (from her perspective), you were trying to be \"polite\" (I assume I assume, you didn't say how you responded to earlier comments and she obviously continued to believe you'd appreciate these \"compliments\"), and it unfortunately built up into this blowing up at her. Are you right to tell her not to comment on your body? Of course. OF COURSE. But would she feel upset if she believed that she'd been being nice to someone, maybe making a work-friend, and suddenly they're doing a 180 and telling her that she's been actively harming them? I'm also assuming since you haven't at all mentioned her reaction that she at least responded appropriately (apologised to you) and also isn't looking for you to apologise. All that \"this is how you made her feel and you should apologise\" is from other people wanting to just get along and keep peace, basically.\n\n\\*(Because if their reasoning is that you should apologise for WHAT you said then fuck them forever, fuck them five times over if they're supposed to be healthcare professionals, and fuck them another ten times for every year they've known you and seen you have to go through this. Fuck them so much, is what I'm saying.)\n\nSo. What I think is that you should apologise, but specifically for WHEN you said this to her. And if you didn't have to work with this person and if I had any reason to think that they were the asshole (defensive when you said it, they told you you'd upset them, they wanted the apology, etc.) then I really wouldn't say that; I'm assuming this is a generally nice person, trying to make friends in their new job, very unfortunately thinking it's Standard Girl Culture to covet and compliment thinness. If I'm being too generous then don't dare apologise. But maybe some work on setting boundaries? Once you're in a better place mentally.\n\nIn all scenarios NTA, likely NAH, or possibly the other coworkers are the assholes.", "YTA. She never meant any harm and is saying this directly to you and shes idolizing you. Im not sure if you actually look unhealthy or actually look good. But youre the only one that knows you have an eating disorder in the situation. She didnt do anything to make it worse. Those are your own mental problems. Regardless of if you look healthy or good theres still a ton of women who idolize social media presences with eating disorders and whether if they realize it or not, look down on themselves and question how they can look like that. She might boarderline also have similar delusions. I don't think its her fault you had a relaspe so i dont know why you had to tell her shes making it worse. Really projecting. You could have shut her down in a way without doing all that and placing the blame that you dont take care of yourself on her.\n\nIts kinda funny how if we took the same situation and made it an overweight girl blaming her peers for being overweight nobody would agree with this.", "NTA.

There's no exucuse for commenting on somebodys weight unless they ask you directly about it. She might have learned her lesson to keep her mouth shut now.", "NTA she needed to hear it. I lost a lot of weight after my mum died and its soul destroying hearing people tell you \"you look so good\" I did not, I was ill, grieving and in a very bad place. Eventually I had enough and when someone commented I ended up saying \"oh it's easy, you've just gotta bury your parent no biggie\" which was harsh but I'dhad enough. It's messed up and the hypocrisy of thinking losing weight is an achievement to comment on but being worried about commenting on people at the other end of the spectrum is hurtful too, everyone needs to just mind their business unless asked", "NTA for having a boundary and giving feedback to your coworker to stop making comments on your body. Perfectly reasonable and necessary. However, YTA for telling your coworker that they are \"making it worse\". It's perfectly fine to give feedback about comments regarding your body but YTA for making specific comments to your coworker as if they are making your disorder worse. Your eating disorder is based on your own behavior; not the behavior of others.", "NTA: Weightloss is personal, and unless you know the person is trying to lose weight, you don't get to damn well comment on their appearance!

Just move on and hope that she does, too.\n\nMay I make a suggestion, though? Next time this happens, consider saying something along the lines of \"Thank you for the compliment, but I've been ill lately.  I want to keep it low key and would prefer that we not talk about it, but don't worry, I'm on the road to recovery.\"  An approach like that will achieve the goal of getting the complimenter to shut up without making them feel misplaced responsibility.", "NTA - I have a chronic illness and my weight fluctuates.

Just because her harm was not malicious doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a problem. And now she\u2019s learned a valuable lesson. She should feel upset by the consequences of her actions but it\u2019s not up to OP to make her feel better about it. Sometimes we screw up in life and hurt someone by mistake. When that happens we\u2019re going to feel bad for a bit. That\u2019s normal, ok, and part of learning. But it isn\u2019t the responsibility of the person we hurt to make us feel better. We feel better by doing better next time. No apology from OP needed"]}
