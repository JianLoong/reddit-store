If that's the case, I do not see how you are T A.", "You were no longer at the table, and the two of you were off to yourselves, so NTA. However, you will be the asshole if you don't tell the rest of us how a shoulder surgery ends up with a damaged penis.", "NTA. No one told those men to eavesdrop.\n\nAlso...\n\n>The next day a got a call from the wife of one of these men, telling me I'd traumatized her husband and literally given him nightmares.\n\nThis GROWN MAN'S wife called you to complain that you gave him nightmares?! I would expect this from the mother of a 9yo, but as adults we've general accepted that various things we come across over the course of our day may give us bad dreams.\n\nLastly, you can't just leave us hanging OP! HOW did shoulder surgery lead to penis damage?! Inquiring minds want to know!", "NTA. It wasn't a dinner conversation, and you weren't speaking to the whole group. If the conversation bothered someone listening in, they could have moved and joined (or listened in on) some other conversation.", "NTA Because in context it looks like you were having a conversation separate from the rest of the party.\n\nI will say this though. Those who work in the medical field truly are desensitized, and it is really hard to be around folks who are that desensitized.\n\nI was recently at a concert, and one of the newcomers to our concert group works in the ER. And he was laughing as he was telling us about treating someone with addiction issues who ended up in the ER with very serious skin and bleeding issues. I understand that this is something that medical professionals may see and deal with every day. However, a concert is not the time or place to talk and laugh about people struggling with addiction, and the horrors that they deal with, and the blood and pain that they were in, and how funny it was to this medical professional.\n\nEspecially because he was new to the group, did not know any of us, especially that some of the people in our group had addiction issues in their past.\n\nThis was not the only case of a medical professional making light of some serious medical issues when the rest of us were just trying to have some fun and relax.\n\nI don't know if there are any seminars or continuing education for medical professionals on how to process their feelings and trauma outside of work, it doesn't seem like it. But I think that should be a necessary class for people to take if they are going to be in the medical field. Many of us are squeamish and can barely handle conversations about blood, let alone hearing someone laugh at someone else's pain.\n\nIn my case, I excuse myself and leave those conversations, because I'm not afraid to make medical professionals feel bad if they are grossing us out with their medical horror stories. However, other people are not as assertive as I am. So you're not the asshole for someone else overhearing you. But on the flip side, I do think there should be some training for medical professionals on what is and is not appropriate to discuss outside of work and where. Not everyone loves these stories and is as desensitized as those who work in the field.", "I think it's pathetic that he had his wife call. He sounds like a large child. His mom probably used to make those calls for him.", "You're NTA.\n\n\nI'm also a medical professional and I've been in that type of conversations often.\n\nYou weren't discussing it with those people but with one particular person. The others just listened.\n\n\nThe people who listened aren't the assholes either because they just happened to listen a conversation. Although I feel bad for him, as he probably got scared that something bad may happen to him next time he needs to go to doctor..\n\n\nI hope that whatever damage/harm that patient had full recovery on both his genitals and everything else. And if course I hope that this nurse got reprimanded for her actions. Some stuff are pretty serious, and in the medical field some mistakes due to negligence can lead to horrible situations (death, permanent mutilation, sterilization, etc)", "NTA. While not a nurse or other *licensed* medical professional, I've been in a medical office for 24 years. Once, me, my work bestie, and 2 Infectious Control Nurses were eating in the cafeteria. Some of our dinner table conversations were GNARLY as hell and were definitely making those within earshot turn green. It was definitely NOT a conversation for otherwise \"polite\" dinner conversation. But the 4 of us just kept eating because it didn't phase us. Those in the medical field truly can talk about things the rest of the world can't even begin to fathom. And this was a grown-up conversation. The others could have walked away.", "NTA\n\nObv it traumatized him bc he's a he and prob anything to do with the penis is going to be traumatic to him. \n\nThis was after the meal.

He didn't need to listen in and he could have walked away if it was bothering him. You were talking shop one on one. \n\nAnd his wife called to complain that you gave her husband nightmares? I assume they're also in their 40s? That's a really mommy move.\n\nDon't worry about it.", "NTA \n\nOh look, it's exactly what I thought it was!\n\nIt's the same thing I tell my 10-year-old, it's not my fault if you're eavesdropping, maybe you should mind your own fucking business. And then his wife cries to you about the repercussions of him being nosy? And he's that insecure about his penis? Are you sure you weren't having a conversation with his mommy?", "Tip: Whenever you use the words \"horror story\", it's not a story for a dinner party.\n\nNTA though. They could have just stopped eavesdropping.", "NTA - but maybe save these stories for situations where people cant/wont over hear", "Soft YTA. Soft because I think medical professionals just don't get how horrifying it is for normals to hear this stuff.\n\nI have relatives in the medical field and they think nothing of discussing horrifying medical stuff at dinner parties because they are not affected by it. They now know not to discuss that kind of thing in front of me or my partner. They're also now more sensitive to other people who might be squeamish about these things.\n\nNow you know, so just remember to keep that type of thing to others of your kind in future.", "NTA but I\u2019m very curious how this could happeb", "NTA\n\nSpeaking about such a topic at the dinner table is going to be a bit taboo - sat down at a meal people do not have the same ability to excuse themselves.\n\nIn smaller groups after a meal, you may still have to be careful - you should probably be wary of any unwitting innocent ears and give a warning before going into the details.\n\nAnyone eavesdropping does it at their own risk though.", "NTA they were listening in on your private conversation with someone else. They deserve to be a little traumatized.", "YTA. Surgical mishaps are not good dinner party conversation.", "I have to say ESH.

If you\u2019re going to tell about other people\u2019s pain and suffering for jollies, do it in professional only groups. First off - and you shouldn\u2019t have to be told this - for privacy reasons. There can\u2019t be that many people whose d!ck was damaged during a shoulder surgery, and if this party was in the same geographic region where this man was treated, this is not okay. \n\nAnd second, for compassion reasons. I know, I know, compassion fatigue and you need to blow off steam and I don\u2019t begrudge you that one bit, just keep it with other pros who can relate. Otherwise you just seem mean, using someone else\u2019s worst day as entertainment.", "I didn\u2019t even read it but everyone knows that gory stuff isn\u2019t dinner talk.", "Gently, YTA\n\nWhat is commonplace for you is not for the rest of the world. What you think of as no big deal may be triggering to others.\n\nI think there is **a time and a place** for these conversations. Maybe if you were outside, just the two of you, and knew for a fact that no one was around.\n\nBut it sounds like you were at a dinner party, in a room, and knew that there were others in the room, but just figured they either (a) wouldn't overhear, or (b) if they heard, wouldn't think it was worth getting traumatized over.\n\nYou were wrong on both. You owe an apology to those people (and perhaps your hosts, if you want to be invited to other events). Good luck.", "YTA. You ran the risk of compromising patient privacy and confidentiality. The injury you described combined with the intended purpose of surgery at a dinner party could compromise those you are mandated to protect - you never know everyone others know or how far a story will be carried to others who you don\u2019t know and whose acquaintances you don\u2019t know and who might know the patient. As far as the others at the dinner party, I don\u2019t know whether they may be traumatized so I can\u2019t really evaluate that. It really depends on the level of detail about anatomy, effects, and body functions you went into, I think. In my opinion, though, a conversation in the presence of others really is not a \u201cprivate\u201d conversation.", "YTA\n\nNot appropriate for the setting. You were all ~~at the same table~~ in the same room around the dinner table - your conversation was in no way private and the expectation should be that other people would hear you whether they want to or not.", "ESH\n\nIf it was so private, as you claim, then you should have taken it outside or in another room. You were at a dinner party with others nearby within earshot. That was rude. (and a possible HIPAA violation, if certain details were revealed). \n\nIf that man didn't want to hear your conversation then he should have moved away or used his words like a grown man, such as \"Hey, do you mind not talking about that stuff right here? It's bothering me.\"\n\nEDIT: I am a medical professional.", "[deleted]", "I'm going with YTA mainly because this seems very close to bordering on a HIPPA violation. This is a unique case in which the patient could be identified later on due to lawsuits or by the community and in those instances it's better to be safe than sorry on protecting patient and medical information. If I were the patient who suffered from this incident, I wouldn't be happy to hear it shared as a dinnertime anecdote", "I've found it's a great conversation piece at the dinner table to demonstrate the surgical treatment of priapism with a small sharp knife and a banana.\n\nNTA.", "Yes, clearly.

There are some people who can get very nauseous at the mention of organs and bloody accidents when they have a full stomach. But it's all about the audience and context. You were having a conversation with another professional, and the other dinner guest had every opportunity to walk away before hearing what they couldn't unhear. they're partially at fault for listening in.\n Personally, I'm rather curious about the rest of the story.", "Yes, YTA.

I'm in the medical field (hospice nurse) so talking about cases with other people present is risky, at best. It's just better not to in the first place. Maybe those voting nta aren't in the medical field or they're just ignorant of the laws. :-)", "\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "Man having nightmares: \n\nYou: ur penis is small LOL", "This. This is the way. ahahha", "Oh if we\u2019re trading catheter horror stories my partner was catheterised because he wasn\u2019t passing fluids only he got an infection, mentioned it when it started, doc was supposed to come back, didn\u2019t, he kept bring it up to the nurses who were seemingly unprepared to call up a doctor so close to the end of main hours. He asked them to at least look because honestly, it was blowing up, they acted like he was an exhibitionist or something. He kept on at them, eventually, annoyed, they got a consultant up. Consultant started off patronising my partner till he lifted the sheet. White face. Ran to the phone to grab anaesthesiologist before he left the building, then shook my partner\u2019s hand and thanked him for persisting. \n\nYou don\u2019t as a rule realise how reluctant medical professionals are to look at penises until they need to. Over lockdown I was reduced to describing further infections on the phone to my GP. Best I could do was a sausage role in short crust pastry. Never thought I\u2019d be begging a receptionist to let me send a dk pic in my fifth decade\u2026", "s/Yes, but this is normal and doesn't happen to men.", "It's more like a water balloon, but yeah.", "In the cafeteria where any person can overhear is bad form.", "They were talking in pairs and groups. It would depend on how close the other people were to all the groups or pairs. It would also depend on how loud they were discussing this. But honestly, the offended dude should have not listened in on a private convo. Plus, if he had such an issue, he should have said something and not have his wife call after the fact.", "True, but if you're having a private convo and other people decide to eavesdrop, and they don't say \"hey, do you mind talking about something else, this is giving me the heebie jeebies\", or move out of earshot, then you can be forgiven for thinking they don't have a problem with the topic you're discussing privately, that they can stop listening to whenever they want.", "I found it, I'm dumb but agree with your vote.", "Just hoping the huge insecurity that comes from it will overshadow whatever trauma he claims to experience from eavesdropping to a conversation.", "that sounds unprofessional af. dicks need medical care, too. \n\nthis is just like how some ppl wont give women CPR for fear of touching boobs", "Sadly you HAVE to advocate for yourself when you're the patient, because no one else will. It's not malicious, but medical staff are humans like everyone else, and therefore failable like anyone else", "Once encountered a patient who ripped out her own catheter with the balloon still intact and was swinging it around her head like a lasso.", "To be entirely fair, nurses get shown a LOT of dicks that don't have anything wrong with them except that they're attached to an exhibitionist. I'm sorry that happened though!", "It\u2019s classless to tell any kind of \u201chorror story\u201d at a social event, especially so when you\u2019re a med pro making yourself look like you\u2019re using a patient\u2019s pain for entertainment.", "Catheterised dicks especially do. And frankly should be monitored as part of infection control procedures.", "I\u2019m literally his carer but I left after the infection started but at a point where a doctor was supposed to be coming within the hour. I felt so guilty I didn\u2019t stay till it was taken care of.\n\nI\u2019m actually inclined toward blaming the consultants more than the nurses, because apparently they seemed very reluctant to call a doctor up. So yeah, in this case, the doctor was glad he\u2019d been bought up. But why were they nervous about doing it?", "If every nurse was afraid to call, I\u2019m afraid of what this doctor was like honestly"]}
