If your brother is somebody that hinders that process for you, don\u2019t feel bad to give yourself that distance from him for the time being.

You will know when it will feel appropriate to reach out to your brother again. When you do, I would suggest you have a heart to heart with him, as both of you will be in a calmer, more neutral place. You can then apologize for saying to him harsher words that you did not mean, but do ask him as to why he made the comments that he did, and let him know that they were very hurtful to you. Objectively, his comments were very insensitive, and he needs to know that, and apologize to you as well. Perhaps you will learn that he was also grieving for your dog, but did not know how to appropriately express it. At the very least, you will be giving him a chance to become a better person, to not repeat the mistakes that he made to somebody else who is grieving over loss in the future.\n\nAs for your parents, they should understand that your words to them were spoken under duress and the pain of loss. And they will forgive you, you are, after all, their child\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re 4 or 34 or 64. I\u2019m sure when the time is right, you could also apologize to them about what you said, to tell them that you didn\u2019t mean the words you expressed.

She came over 2 days in a row for several hours each time. \n\nEven with all of us working hard on it (the trainer, my husband, my dad, my mother and I) we couldn't make any progress.

My parents euthanized my cat when I was at college and didn't tell me until a few days before I was coming home on a break. And it wasn't that she had just been euthanized recently; it had been 1-2 months prior. They actually said on the phone they were calling to tell me because when I got home I would see the cat wasn't there. \n\nThat's just a SMALL sampling of the fucked up shit that happened throughout my life until graduating college and moving 8 hours away from my mother.

Our boarder has a behavioralist on staff. Our dog is on Fluoxetine and Gabapentin. We take every precaution.\n\nShe only goes to the vet at the very last appointment of the day. Once he lets the staff know they are there he they wait in the car until the vet tech indicates they can come in. She then goes through the back employee entrance and straight into an exam room. Leaves the same way. She always has the same vet and same vet tech. Now that's she comfortable with them, if only one thing is being done she doesn't need a muzzle. If it's multiple things the vet still like to on a muzzle as a precaution.\n\nWhen being boarded she is kept in an entirely seperate building from the other dogs. She's kept in a suite that is usually used for families boarding more than one dog. She never goes outside with the other dogs. She is taken on walks individually by staff members she likes. \n\nOur back yard is completely fenced in. The fence is wrought iron with gates that are locked and you need a key to unlock. She is never taken out for walks so she doesn't have an opportunity to harm someone. Though she's kind of agoraphobic so she doesn't like going more than half a block from home anyways. \n\nI could write a whole treatise on what we did when we got our second dog. Long story short, it was a year in a half before they were allowed in the same room together. Always supervised and in the beginning both on leashes. Once we felt they were comfortable enough to remove the leashes, they were never unsupervised together. Not a quick trip to the bathroom, or to the kitchen for a drink. Since we didn't want to be outside to supervise every time they went potty, they had to take turns.\n\nAfter months of that, we finally felt comfortable enough with them being together alone in the yard, hanging together in the family room while in the kitchen doing laundry, etc. But never left alone in the house together. Whenever both of use left the house bub would come with us. We went on vacation/family reunion in June. The dogs were boarded together in the family suite. In the 3 years we've had him that was the FIRST time that had been truly completely left alone together.\n\nWe have had our dog for 8 years. Not a single time in those 8 years has she ever bitten anybody or bitten/attacked another dog. I will do everything in my power to protect her and the world around her.

We would still regard anyone who said \"I felt the same way when iron man died\" to a grieving parent to be a complete and utter ahole. You don't need to have kids to understand that belittling the relationship is stupid. \n\nMoreover, these are brothers not strangers. Their relationship must be pretty bad already if little brother never noticed that OP has a strong relationship with his pet. Hell, I don't get along with my brother and he straight up dislikes pets but he still knows that I love my dogs and cats so much that he would never dare say anything remotely that dismissive to me. If OP's bro was even a little involved with his life then he should have known better. He doesn't need to understand every owner's relationship with their pet, just his brothers. \n\nThis whole post doesn't seem realistic to me but if it is then not only are they both immature but their relationship has obv got way more issues than either of their isolated comments. \n\nSoft ESH because I know how deep and overwhelming grief can be (luckily my usually snarky bro chose to say nothing rather than offend me) but op needs to act his age and patch things up if he cares for his brother at all.", "Where on earth did you get \"jealous\" from?", ">Not everyone loves pets as family, especially if they've never had pets of their own.

I don't even particularly like kids, most of them get on my nerves. But I am able to understand that there are people who want to have kids and actually love their kids (even when I can't understand why someone would want to have kids, why they want to change their whole life and have it revolves around kids). I would never tell someone grieving their kid that \"it's just a kid, you can get another\". Because I have basic empathy.\n\nSo excusing OP's adult brother's lack of empathy with the *\"he never had one, so he can't understand it\"* bs is ridiculous. **If someone has basic empathy, they can understand / can see that an other person loves something and is sad about loosing it (even if they don't understand why they love that), then that person won't say inconsiderate shit like OP's brother to the grieving person, regardless of what living being (human, animal or even a flower) is the object of love and loss in the story, or even if it's an object the other person is sad about.**\n\nIf OP's brother doesn't have a kid already, then is it ok if he doesn't understand that people love their kids and are sad about their death and if he says inconsiderate things to grieving parents? Because if he never had a kid, it's hard to understand for him how people care about their kids so much? Or do you think that's different, there's no excuse for his lack of empathy then because that's a human but this is \"just\" an animal?", "\"This is Arlo.

I\u2019m obsessed with my animals and it would upset me as well. It was insensitive. Teens and early 20s can be idiots. But there\u2019s something gross about a 34 year old ripping up a 22 year old sibling in that way. If the dog comment was hurtful imagine how the brother felt. It was a big escalation. The little brother deserved to be called out, but OP went too far. If we are expecting more from the 22 year old we certainly should expect more from a 34 year old. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know if they can use the excuse of being upset in the moment when they then continued the snark with the parents.
