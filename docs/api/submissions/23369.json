All children should be fortunate enough to be allowed pets, who will become a part of their family for the rest of their lives. When I said given, I meant by the parents, never, ever by anyone outside their home who will not be responsible for the care and well being of these animals. \n\nParents who want their children to experience the miracle of birth should never adopt a kitten or puppy with the thought of having them experience one litter. A better idea is to contact a rescue group and foster a pregnant cat. Sadly, there are many of them needing temporary homes.\n\nOf course I recommend rescue groups for anyone looking for a pet. These groups know the animals well and are great at finding a good match for their home because they have been staying in foster homes. The foster parents can tell you who is good with  dogs, or kids, and what little quirks they might have."]}
