It wasn\u2019t up to OP when they had another son so why should OP have to be nice to their other son, just because they want him to be?", "Of course he should have known better. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay to go nuclear over the brother\u2019s comments.", "Then having another son is nothing to do with OP\u2019s wishes but then expecting OP to treat their other son how they want him to has everything to do with his wishes.", "He\u2019s not autistic.", "Um, I\u2019m autistic and I\u2019d never say something that cruel. Don\u2019t use autism as an excuse for that.", "I had to scroll back up to check their ages.  I would have guessed OP was about 12-15yo. \n\n12yo NTA\n16yo ESH \n34yo YTA", "Or even \u201cYou\u2019re inventive and there\u2019s no point talking to you right now.\u201d Or \u201cI hope you never have a pet\u201d would be fine.", "In a way, the parents did choose to have a child\u2026.", "Well, I mean look how their parents reacted too. It\u2019s all of them", "OP\u2019s brother was the one running to OP\u2019s parents. It\u2019s the parents\u2019 choice to intervene and try to maintain that relationship when OP doesn\u2019t want it.", "No such thing as overreaction. If you start something, expect to get hit 10 times as hard by the other guy.", "i agree with NTA but maybe her brother was like 6 idk", "Being that age I\u2019m guessing it was his own first pet that was truly his. I\u2019ll probably be that age when my first one passes. I won\u2019t take it very well, and if I was in OP\u2019s shoes I would have been violent", "My dad is a lot like this actually, whenever him and my mom (or anyone really) fight he just says the most hurtful things possible, because he thinks he wins a fight when someone just doesn't wanna listen to him talk anymore.", "He's 22", "While I agree they are both the AH, Who are you to tell him that he shouldn't have been so hurt by it? He lost a being he was incredibly close to and someone around him was treating it like it was something small just like you are trying to do.", "It depends. Someone making light of the death of my dog would hurt me ten times more than my brother cutting me out of his life, since I value my dog more. Many people also care more about their pets than siblings.", "I never said they need permission but they made it sound like I should be grateful to have a brother and cherish that relationship. They made it sound like he\u2019s a gift when he isn\u2019t.", "Lashing out is hardly ever warranted in any situation. Particularly in a way to that is so cruel as to disavow any love or affection for your own brother. Brother was a jerk, yes, but mature people don\u2019t respond to jerks by being an absolute AH.", "plus as i think abt it, i have been told \"its just a dog\" so many times, by people who really matter to me- i judge them in silence bc i know my bond and grief is valid. insecurity is a real ass kicker but getting ahead of that makes it way easier to control your emotions when people are cruel like your brother was. he was the AH until you got wildly aggressive & personal with his existence.", "Being related means nothing.", "The only thing that matters is who started it. OP\u2019s brother started this so OP is fully justified in going all out, no-holds-barred.\n\nNTA.", "ikr? OP behaves like a 14-year-old. Definitely a YTA to OP.", "He\u2019s seen it once. Dude laughed when Wick\u2019s dog died.", "I agree with that but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like he never loved him as he said he did care about him before the comment he made, and I don\u2019t think this is something that should necessarily completely tear apart what they had (assuming they had a pretty good relationship before so if that\u2019s not true I\u2019m wrong). I think this is a good moment for his brother to learn not to be a dipshit and hopefully learn some empathy which he seems to be lacking. I still don\u2019t think the comment to the parents was fair though other than I\u2019m guessing it was said out of a place of anger and hurt.", "I'm wondering what type of parents raise a child who thinks that way. There's some empathy missing for sure.", "No. They're 22, I'd expect that from an 8 year old. \n\nOr is their brother special needs?", "I value life as life. \n\nWhy do you think you're more valuable than other lifeforms? Because you can access reddit?\n\nPathetic. You've no more value than any other living thing.", "Not the poster you\u2019re replying to but yes to your question.", "I mean iron man dying was heartbreaking I cried too. He probably just doesn\u2019t understand people can grieve for their pets. If u never had your own pet you won\u2019t necessarily understand why people grieve them as if they are a person. He was insensitive she could have told him off but she probably vented years of frustration instead.", "Yes\u2026.But, however misguided, the brother was attempting to empathize with his brother. OP said what he said to hurt his brother\u2026which makes him an AH.", "I\u2019m wondering if brother has a disability and was trying to relate to op but didn\u2019t really know how", "A kid doesn\u2019t get to decide for two other adults if they wanna have a kid, again, I don\u2019t understand the logic", "The brothers age is in the post. 22.", "The brother is an adult.", "They meant a brother/sister relationship is gift not him, they want to see you get on because when they pass u could be each other\u2019s support system. Honestly can you not really not see why they are trying to keep the peace.", "Are you sure you are even in your 30\u2019s? You sound like you are 12.", "I disagree, sure you might have been told \u201cit\u2019s just a dog\u201d but did anybody openly mock you when you were sad your dog died? Because that\u2019s what his brother was doing. He knew what he was doing by comparing it to Iron Man. He was laughing at OP for being sad.", "There\u2019s no such thing as the other part being the AH until you retaliate. If someone hurts you first you have the right to respond as harshly as you want to stamp them out completely. Just look at what US did to Japan.", "Are you twelve too ?", "\u201cHe started it!!!\u201d \u201cYeah!? Well I wish you were never born!\u201d \n\nSounds like an episode of full house", "Yeah no I wouldn\u2019t associate with him if he casually acts like dog\u2019s dying it\u2019s a laughing matter,.", "idk, maybe he couldn't process it as much. When my parents called on me to inform the dog I fed and raised died, my immediate response was \"how?\". She dying hurt me, but to this day idk why I asked that.", "Lol. You sound unhinged. I assume you think the child should have been sacrificed so the gorilla could live. \nPsycho.", "Trivialization isn\u2019t empathy.", "The adults can decide for themselves but in this case they are deciding for OP by telling him he should treat his brother well.\n\nThe logic is why should OP treat his brother well when he didn\u2019t want the brother? Only the parents wanted the brother, so only the parents can be expected to treat him well.", "One day if another species comes and treats you like nothing, then you'd understand. You're taking humans being in top of food chain for granted.", "Yup.", "I think most people do.", "Someone who has never owned a pet cannot empathize. \n\nAll children should be given pets. It teaches them to be better, kinder human beings.", "It\u2019s just absolutely bizarre to me, like the chick who sued her parents for being born \u201cugly\u201d, there was also a guy who sued his wife because she \u201chid\u201d her real looks with plastic surgery and kids were born \u201cugly\u201d. How are you gonna be mad for a sibling getting born? \ud83d\ude02", "Out of respect for the parents at the very least, because he lives under their roof, because he is already born? Pick one. You don\u2019t really get to complain about other people having sex and reproducing. People gonna people.", "I haven\u2019t lived under their roof for 15 years. I never complained about their other son until they expected me to love him unconditionally the way they do.", "Okay my bad about the living part, I stand corrected, however, I still stand with them, but I\u2019m biased, I would do terrible things for my two siblings, there\u2019s nobody biologically closer to me than them and they\u2019re all I have left after my parents will pass. How can I not love them? I hope you feel the same way one day."]}
