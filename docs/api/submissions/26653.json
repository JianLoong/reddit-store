Your wedding, your rules. People shaming you are the AHs, but so are the parents who let their kids act like that. We had kids at our wedding because we wanted them there. Ages 3 months to 14 years. About 15 of them. They all behaved perfectly. Better than some of the adults. They sat nicely for a 4 course plated dinner. They danced and had fun. No running around or getting into trouble.

Our parents made the planning a nightmare, our DJ who came recommended completely flaked on us was recommended from my Aunt, our wedding date was actually dictated by my mother in-law to work with my sister in-laws schedule... The list goes on, only thing was completely ours was the photographer who cost 3 times as much as my in-laws choice but was boss and stepped up majorly after the DJ sent a replacement, without our schedule leaving us without an MC. My brother in law used the other photographer, their proofs were a massive stack of 4x6's and we've never seen a wedding picture of their framed while ours are still up in many houses 15 years later. \n\nTLDR:\n\nYou probably did that out of order.

It's a loved one, or someone I'm fond of. I saw them get married! Great! It's a treasured memory. This reception is a little... chaotic! But it's good to spend some time with my loved ones. I have a great time and get back to my life. \n\nI then check my social media in a couple of weeks and see my friend/family member posted some of their wedding pictures. But.... they aren't right?

I guess I wasn't important enough to be invited to the real wedding? Or be respected enough to told the truth about the situation ahead of time. \n\nThat feels pretty shitty to me. I thought I was a respected friend or family member. Turns out I was just invited because her parents wanted it and she didn't want to put up a fight. \n\nFor what it's worth, I think this could've been ENTIRELY prevented by simply telling people the truth: you don't want kids at your wedding so this is going to be a basically a party for your friends and family in honor of your new marriage.

I literally couldn't even sit in on my very best friends wedding reception because I wasn't religious anymore. (Mormons) You don't need to watch people kiss over an alter to celebrate their marriage, imo that's a pretty weird stipulation. The reception is the most family involved part of the wedding. They get to dance, drink, sing, chat, and have fun. They should have been more than happy to have been able to enjoy that, I doubt they would have kept their kids quiet and respectful during the ceremony if they allowed you to get puked on w/o apology and were getting teens so drunk they vomitted.

A couple people (that weren\u2019t even invited?) were really upset with us about having a kid-free wedding which we established before we had even planned anything. That drama along with the headache of trying to plan and make specific accommodations for everyone on \u201cour day\u201d and completely at our own expense made us decide to just sneak off and tie the knot on our own terms a few months before the actual wedding. It actually turned out to have a great effect because only our immediate families knew, and since we were already legally married, i asked my grandfather to give the \u201cphony bologna ceremony\u201d and he was honored to be apart of it without even having to actually get ordained.

You have certain expectations going into a big wedding (probably chaos) and other expectations going into a small wedding (probably a much more refined and easier to control situation).

Then they announced after the wedding that they had actually been married for almost a year already, they\u2019d eloped to Vegas previously. So we were all pretty confused about the drama in the first place. It wasn\u2019t even a real wedding, why was there a problem with travel plans interfering with a pretend ceremony!? So. Maybe this is becoming more common, and it clearly is important to the people involved.", "Yeah if I was one of the guests I'd think it was kinda weird but wouldn't think much else about it and move on with my life. NTA. But if I was in the wedding party or had to attend both ceremonies I'd be very annoyed", "There are many places where the legal and religious ceremonies happen at different times.", "The same people currently complaining about being invited to the \u201cfake wedding\u201d would still be complaining they weren\u2019t invited to the \u201creal wedding\u201d (ceremony) if they\u2019d only been invited to the reception. They\u2019re just looking for something to be hurt over. Most people attend weddings to honor the couple and experience the celebratory event, not for the gratification of knowing a paper was signed somewhere that day. That\u2019s a weird detail to fixate on. \n\nI\u2019ve been to two weddings for the same couple (one intimate and one big) and both felt \u201creal\u201d and special in their own ways. Never occurred to me to think of one as \u201cfake,\u201d that\u2019s just drama-seeking. Most people at the big wedding didn\u2019t know the small one had happened and weren\u2019t entitled to know, since that\u2019s how the couple wanted it.", "Because it\u2019s not legal and obviously ppl are reeeeeewally much into paperwork and administration.", "That is literally how it works in the US. If you want to get married in a church, that\u2019s fine. However, that\u2019s not legally binding in and of itself. You still have to file the marriage certificate with the courthouse for it to be \u201clegal\u201d.", "\"I'm having a second, separate ceremony for just the bridal party\" is a small detail though. It's also a detail that, and this one is important, **doesn't pertain to them**.", "The wedding is not about the guests and their reactions.", "Then they should act like adults and not rsvp.", "When you have a party, though, you don\u2019t invite someone and then say \u201coh we\u2019re are also having a few other parties this year. You\u2019re not invited, but I thought I should tell you upfront that this isn\u2019t going to be our only party.\u201d Like, in what world would you have a party invitation that emphasizes a totally different party, with a different purpose and intention?", "There was only one reception. The other wedding was a family affair.\n\n\nYou sound extremely entitled.", "But if there is no A list party, how is there a B list party?  1 party, 1 guest list. A separate ceremony that is just the vows and doesn't have an audience besides the participating wedding party is absolutely none of the wedding guests business or concern, and the party they chose to go to not knowing about the intimate ceremony is every bit as valid a wedding as if the intimate ceremony had not occurred. Celebrating a new marriage with a party and making vows in a ceremony are distinct.", "Specifically, what was taken from these people that attended? They saw a ceremony of loved ones. They enjoyed a reception. They celebrated and gave a wedding gift. That is a wedding. Is wasn't a trick. They weren't asked to give multiple gifts or this was all to fool them. They went and enjoyed a full-on wedding. Full stop.    \n\n\nThe couple having a smaller ceremony for only the bridal party and parents changes nothing of that. Because attendees wouldn't have been invited to that one anyway. This is as selfish and foolish as getting mad you didn't get invited on the honeymoon.", "Maybe.  But that would be their own reaction to manage.  If they didn\u2019t want to attend (or give a gift!) that would be their choice.  OP didn\u2019t let them make that choice.\n\nIt gives the impression of being a deceitful gift grab - even if that wasn\u2019t the intent.", "Shit I just noticed your username. You do need a hug.", "I\u2019m talking about you. You sound like an entitled wedding guest.", "Most places the officiant takes the paper work and sends it off.", "Depends how you define most places.

I got married in a beautiful greenhouse full of exotics plants followed by pictures in and around the outdoor gardens with just family. Then we all headed to a restaurant that Hubby and I had booked half of and met up our friends there for dinner, drinks, dessert etc. Does that count as Canadian-redneck? \ud83d\ude02", "That's how my wife and I were married, small ceremony with close friends and family followed by a ~3 day reception where all were invited and all got trashed. It was a wild time and I loved every second of it.", "Maybe I'm not being clear but we are saying the same thing. I think I switched up fake and real.", "And if you, by any devine power, would be granted permission to bring it....\nYou'd turn off the sound, would you not?\n\nI have already mastered the art of looking very angry and disappointed at anyone who keeps their phone on volume during official moments. I would get fed up with the mario sound pretty fast", "Or you do what my parents did and tell three boys ages 11, 9, and 7 to suck it up and be respectful because that's your cousin who you adore and you should be nice to them.", "No one said it was better. It just makes more sense than thinking someone went up to the DJ like, \"hey, could you play the Mario Kart song?\"", "People will 100% always find something to bitch about haha.", "It makes sense when you think of it from an anthropological kind of standpoint. It's the ceremony itself that is the important thing to people. Friends and family all come together to support the couple, both emotionally and literally through gift-giving. An important friend missing from the wedding might make someone feel like they don't have their friends support for their relationship (but shit happens, obv). People attending weddings also like to participate in the ceremony itself because it makes them feel like they are actually part of something and that their support matters for the couple. The legal stuff is the least important part. I feel like everyone talking about fake weddings and \"real\" weddings is missing the point. A wedding is just a ritual, it's as real as people participating in it make it. \n\nOP had two weddings, I don't think it's a big deal. Plenty of people have multiple weddings, especially if they have family that lives very far away who can't travel. Them framing it as a gatcha like they tricked a bunch of people is not going to ingratiate them to anyone, I feel that is their mistake.", "Oh absolutely. There's also times when someone gets married at the courthouse and then a few months later they do a big thing with family and friends. Some do an entire ceremony, too.\n\nI could be off base, but that doesn't seem to be what OP is implying happened here, though. It was a faux wedding for her family so they *thought* they were at the real thing, and then she had what she feels was her \"real\" wedding later. \n\nIt's the deception that makes it weird.", "I agree that if people want to, they'll find something to bitch about. Ya can't stop 'em lol.\n\nHowever, I do think there's a difference between being honest and having people complain vs. being almost sneaky and then people complaining. If you like people enough to invite them to celebrate with you, just be honest about what you're doing. Being deceptive is going to breed doubt and suspicion.", "So really the second one was \u201cfake?\u201d The first one was the legal ceremony?", "Sorry, can you clarify - was the first ceremony \"just\" religious, and the second was the legally binding one? So you legally got married in the second ceremony?\n\nNTA in any case.", "Then why call the second wedding a wedding?  Which one did you file the paperwork for?", "It's fake because they know to *you* it wasn't the real ceremony, and the \"real\" ceremony was what you held later and if people ask you when you got married, that'll be the date you give.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily call you an AH but what you did feels underhanded; you could've just said, \"Look, we're throwing a big reception party to celebrate our marriage after a private ceremony\" and then invited people. Instead, you said, \"this is the wedding\" and went through all the motions only it wasn't really. \n\nI can see why people feel lied to; seems shitty.", "But it doesn't require a courthouse ceremony. You just mail in the signed form after the wedding", "It very much does when people need to get clothes, buy gift, and take time off their work for a fake wedding that they may have chosen to not come to if they knew", "I couldn't disagree more. They might not be the main focus, but a wedding is definitely also about friends and family and sharing the moment with them to me.", "Oh, absolutely. And the bride really never has to care about my feelings ever, at any point about anything.\n\nBut that is how I would feel, and as someone who has been a bride who eloped, I would never want to make my guests feel they were deceived. Being honest and upfront with our guests was something important to us.", "I\u2019m really not sure what the hang up is in simply telling people what they\u2019ve been invited too. If it\u2019s a party celebrating the wedding, tell them that. If it\u2019s a wedding, tell them that. Don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s a wedding when it isn\u2019t.", "> Celebrating a new marriage with a party and making vows in a ceremony are distinct.\n\n\nThat\u2019s the problem.

If they were they could have chosen to attend or not. They were invited to a reception and a make believe ceremony.", "My thoughts exactly \u2014 it sounds like the only difference between the two is that one ceremony was (legally?) real. That\u2019s kind of a picky detail to be angry about.\nIf the guests were present for both a \u201cfake\u201d ceremony *and* a real reception, then there should be literally no issue. \n\nAnd from my understanding, a lot of couples sign their marriage certificates later on, so the ceremony doesn\u2019t even make them legally married anyway. For all the guests know, the second ceremony could have just been a fun little extra ceremony to sign their marriage certificates.", "If they wanted a small wedding then have a small wedding and invite people who make the cut. That\u2019s not what they did. \n\nThese people were told they were close, paid up for it (with the exception of messy babies and drunk teens), then found out they paid friend prices for acquaintance level.", "I will make the same point I made the other day on that one where they didn't tell people they had already done their courthouse stuff. \n\nIts none of their business anymore than if the couple was a virgin or how much they spent on the wedding.", "It is the name of a punk band from the 80's.", "Me too. Just realized I've been duped. But at least once invited to small ceremony too", "That actually sounds lovely! This wedding is a reception in some family land outside of the city with BYOB and no dress code with the expectation you're camping in the yard because there's no taxis or Ubers out there. That's what makes It Canadian-redneck ohhh and the Shania Twain \ud83d\ude09", "Well you said this\n\n>Yeah but the real ceremony involved vomit on her wedding dress\n\nBut the real ceremony didn't since it was child free so I'm not sure what you're trying to say.", "Or headphones for a better gaming experience (and to drown out 'parent music' as a kid)", "Sadly, parents like yours who are responsible and teach their kids to behave well in public seem to be in a minority.", "Ha! OK. Point made!", "Good points, I see what you mean.", "wouldn't it be neither?\n\nYou are legally married when the person who officiated the wedding submits the paperwork to the government and the government accepts it.

The modern purpose of a wedding isn't to legally bind two people, it's to celebrate two people committing to marriage/life together. Tons of people don't get legally married at their wedding. \n\n\nIf you went, and celebrated the couple getting married, then congrats, it was a real wedding. Stop letting a bruised ego ruin a fun event.", "It was, though!!! They got married in a church, under God, in front of all their friends and family, then threw a huge reception! *Then*, they went to the courthouse to make it official with *the state*, wore a beautiful dress, hung out with their immediate family in a gazebo the next weekend, and people are acting like they didn\u2019t see these people get married? Ask the preacher who married them if it was a fake wedding!", "Legitimate question what is the actual difference? Because they still made their vows the two families and friend groups interacted, the party was still had, and people still had fun. A wedding is about two sides mixing and becoming closer that was accomplished. The vows made are not any less serious nor is the time shared together. This way they just had way less stress and were able to have a better time by not stressing out about kids ruining a couple of thousand dollar dress and etc.", "it was a wedding with a ceremony and vows. and also a party. The OTHER event was also a wedding with a ceremony and vows, but IT was NOT a party. Both ceremonies were presumably beautiful expressions of love, one public, one private. Being offended you were at the ONLY public ceremony and ONLY party makes a guest an insufferable and entitled buffoon. The religious significance of already being married when doing the ceremony again and the government's interest in which of the ceremonies was the one referenced on the paperwork they file are absolutely not anyone's concern no matter how close.", "they wanted a wedding without children, and to celebrate with friends. so it's either A: take parents money and include children (which involved a lot of messiness with kids) or B: force people to \"make the cut\", maybe squeeze in a few people beyond the bridal party and people get pissy. \n\nThey did A so EVERYONE could celebrate and enjoy the occasion. Then didn't even fully do B- it was JUST THE PARTY. Do you get mad when you're invited to a wedding but not the bachelorette parties? That's the level of entitlement you're spewing right now.", "That's exactly what they did. That's literally what the second wedding was. Over half the country's living paycheck to paycheck, not everyone has the budget to throw a big party. That's why with parents paying for it, they celebrated with EVERYONE. Everyone got the same exact same experience. Nobody had to \"make the cut\" and miss out.\n\nYou're not entitled to be in anyone's wedding, nor are you obligated to attend. The first one had a vastly larger budget and allowed them to invite the people they care about. The way you're phrasing it is that these people were duped into taking time off and done so only to gain wedding presents.\n\nNobody's told \"they were close\", they were invited to be part of a marital ceremony and celebration.
