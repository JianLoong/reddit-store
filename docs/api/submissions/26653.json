It sounds like a wonderful way to handle the situation - one rowdy celebration with the families, including the kids, and one solemn celebration with the adults. \n\nAs far as the people being invited to the \u201cfake\u201d celebration - just look at how few people apologized for (or tried to control) the actions of the children.", "Why the drama?

If I've learnt anything from planning my own wedding, there is just no pleasing everyone! So the best you can hope for is pleasing yourself and the majority of your guests, but there's always someone who's going to winge about something or another!

We used to do that with New Years countdown, having one at 8 pm for the kids, then another one at midnight with just the adults.

You did good!", "YTA- If I had saved a day, made arrangements and spent money and bought gifts to attend your fake wedding I would be insulted, annoyed and feel like I got tricked. Just learn to stand up for yourself and get married the way you want to, forego the theatre. You frame it like you were just having two ceremonies, but then why did you keep that a secret? Because nobody would come!\n\nAlso, I'm sure everyone wanted to fuss with their kids to get them dressed up, and pack snacks and games and diapers and all that shit for your dumb ceremony in the first place.

I'd see it as two ceremonies not unlike those who elope, have multiple religious ceremonies etc. \nThose upset are just jealous they weren't the trusted ones with the golden ticket so to say. They no longer feel important. You could try and placate them but tbh they sound petty and it probably isn't a battle you are going to win.

Your wedding, your rules. People shaming you are the AHs, but so are the parents who let their kids act like that. We had kids at our wedding because we wanted them there. Ages 3 months to 14 years. About 15 of them. They all behaved perfectly. Better than some of the adults. They sat nicely for a 4 course plated dinner. They danced and had fun. No running around or getting into trouble. Some of my little cousins did bring their Ninendo Switches, but I had mine too so it was fine. \ud83d\ude02", "Nta that sounds brilliant", "NTA \n\nActually kind of brilliant but you screwed up letting the \"secrete\" out. My wife and I did the big wedding thing too, but we wanted kids to be there, mostly, minus a few we knew would be... problematic. And though our wedding was a good time, we recommend people elope. Our parents made the planning a nightmare, our DJ who came recommended completely flaked on us was recommended from my Aunt, our wedding date was actually dictated by my mother in-law to work with my sister in-laws schedule... The list goes on, only thing was completely ours was the photographer who cost 3 times as much as my in-laws choice but was boss and stepped up majorly after the DJ sent a replacement, without our schedule leaving us without an MC. My brother in law used the other photographer, their proofs were a massive stack of 4x6's and we've never seen a wedding picture of their framed while ours are still up in many houses 15 years later. \n\nTLDR:\n\nYou probably did that out of order. Get married secretly first then have the party and fake wedding, if you like. That way the pressure is off and it's just a party fuck everybody else, eat cake shut up and dance. You did the right thing though, maybe not the fake marriage part but yeah, nta and good call.", "NTA", "Apart from this idea being brilliant, inclusive and flat out awesome, there really shouldn't be anything for anyone to complain about.

One was full on fun, the other more intimate and serene. \n\nNTA by any stretch of the imagination. Those who are complaining are not your friends, but they are exactly what you are not. \n\nCongratulations and wishing you decades and decades of happiness, bliss and frequent zany adventures. \ud83d\udc96 Y'all are stars!", "NTA. The people who didn\u2019t make the cut for the dream wedding know exactly why and that\u2019s why they are upset.

I mean, you weren't rude and you didn't hurt anyone. But it's super weird to have an entire fake ceremony.
