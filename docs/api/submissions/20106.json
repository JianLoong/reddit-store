I met my friend in the first year of university (I am Australian), we were taking the same major in a Bachelor of Arts and hit it off almost instantly in our class together. I\u2019m very cautious about who I become friends with due to some trauma related stuff in my past, so I did a healthy amount of stalking beforehand to make sure they\u2019d be a good friend. Anyway, we have been closest friends with each other since we were 19 and 20 respectively, doing everything together, and we would always jokingly flirt with each other due to the nature of our friendship. We would always wingman each other at uni parties but my friend would never have any luck. One night last week we were out for a few drinks at the bar, and my friend got very drunk. I was only a couple of drinks deep, so I was much more sober, and my friend starting taking the flirting to a next level (I am now happily married with a kid) to the point where it was a bit much. After this, it went downhill and it devolved into her having an almost cry session about how she is 37 and still doesn\u2019t ever get with anyone. Because I was a few deep, I was maybe a little more loose-lipped than usual, but still sane enough to think she wouldn\u2019t remember anything I said. Anyway, I made the mistake of just blurting out \u201cIt\u2019s because you are just so, so ugly.\u201d At the time my justification for saying this is maybe she would realise and take measures to improve her attractiveness, but obviously she didn\u2019t take it this way, and she ended up remembering the comment. She has not spoken to me for a week now, and while I don\u2019t stand by what I said, I did truthfully mean it to try and help her, and I don\u2019t think our almost two decade long friendship should end because of something so juvenile.", "created_utc": 1687225808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dxjkf/aita_for_telling_my_closest_friend_that_she_is/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not going to be a dick and say anything rude to you over it , but I will say you could\u2019ve been so much kinder. Maybe you said it that harshly because you were annoyed with her behavior or maybe you really did think it would help but it doesn\u2019t. If you genuinely cared about her and her feelings then that shouldn\u2019t even be something you\u2019re thinking nonetheless saying to her. You could\u2019ve found so many other helpful and uplifting ways or handling that. You could\u2019ve told her that she\u2019s a great person but that maybe she should take some more pride in her appearance and take some cute pics for a dating app or something. You could\u2019ve suggested some makeup or ways to put herself out there. In no way is it okay, appropriate or kind to be that harsh and cruel. It\u2019s not your job to judge her attractiveness because I guarantee the right person for her will love her as she is. She is still worthy of love exactly how she is and she will be attractive to somebody. You should\u2019ve gently pushed her to put herself out there more instead. She might just need some time or maybe she\u2019ll never talk to you again. But that\u2019s also completely justified. To you it may have been nothing but if your best/ close friend said something cruel to you about something you may be insecure about it would probably change how you feel. You\u2019d probably be insecure in how that person sees you. The fact that you trusted and felt comfortable around this person and then to find out they think you\u2019re really fucking ugly and that\u2019s how they see you is fucking awful. It probably destroyed any confidence and security in your friendship with her and you should feel kinda bad . You don\u2019t handle the people you care about with that kind of lack of care. Tact is important. So yes it\u2019s justifiable if she never talks to you again and no it\u2019s not \u201cjuvenile\u201d. It\u2019s human. Either apologize or leave her alone so she can heal on her own.", "This is literally the definition of YTA.
