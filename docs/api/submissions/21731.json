{"id": 21731, "submission_id": "14usthg", "title": "AITA for being indecently exposed while feeding my baby?", "selftext": "I (F28) recently had mine and my husband's (M32) first child - a little boy who is now five months old. Our baby is amazing, and we are so in love with him.\n\nAfter the birth, we only allowed our parents/siblings to see the baby so that we could have some time to settle into our new lives. We didn't want to be overrun with visitors, but decided to host a BBQ this weekend so some more extended family and friends could meet baby. It went really well, and everyone was so over the moon to see the little one. I would like to clarify, this wasn't a huge gathering, maybe only 10 people.\n\nAt one point, I took baby inside for his lunch. I am nursing him at the moment, so I went to his nursery so we could have some privacy. As most people were in the backyard, I thought that this would be a quiet spot for the two of us.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, my best friend's (F27) husband (M29) needed the bathroom at some point and came into the house. I think he was having a bit of a snoop around because he ended up opening the door to the nursery where I was with the baby (which is nowhere near the bathroom), and inevitably found us. He was quite shocked and fumbled his words a little bit before closing the door and leaving. I was not very happy that this had happened because I had specifically gone looking for a quiet moment so baby could eat, but it is what it is and I thought it was over.\n\nWhen I walked out of the house a little while later, I was surprised to see that my best friend and her husband had left. My husband tells me that when best-friend's-husband (BFH) came out of the house, he immediately reprimanded my husband for the fact that I was exposing myself and acting inappropriately in front of guests. Of course, my husband was very confused by what was going on, but BFH basically just grabbed my friend and the two of them left leaving everyone else quite stunned.\n\nA few hours after everyone had gone home, BFH started a group chat with myself, my husband, and my best friend, and basically said that he could not believe how I had exposed myself to him today when I knew he was happily married, and that I should have more shame. He said that I was not setting a good example for my son, who would grow up as some kind of deviant because I am refusing to feed him in a \"normal and healthy way\".\n\nI am honestly quite upset about the whole thing, and no one has responded (my best friend has not even opened any of my other messages), but I wonder if maybe I should have just gone with a bottle feed during the event so that this never would have happened. My husband thinks BFH has lost his mind, but I wonder, was I the AH?", "created_utc": 1688890217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14usthg/aita_for_being_indecently_exposed_while_feeding/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He did it deliberately. \n\nHe got on the front foot with the accusations to prevent you from being able to call him out. \n\nHe\u2019s a pervert.", "Absolutely not. Feeding your child is not exposing yourself or a suggestive and  sexualized thing?!!!\n\nNta", "NTA . \nIt is completely unnecessary of him to venture around the house to begin with . It seems like he had a guilty conscience and told wife his version of the story to cover his own . If they do not respect your privacy in your own home then good riddance !", "NTA.  BFH is nuts.  By his reasoning, accidentally opening a door on someone using a toilet would also be \"exposing yourself in public\".  \n\nHe is trying to find a way to make sure he is blameless.  This is very nasty behaviour on his part.", "My guess is: he was snooping and trying to catch a peek.  When best friend found out she was pissed and he is trying to play the victim to not have her think he is a creeper, which he is.  Who the fuck enters a closed door without knocking first?", "NTA \n\nYou have every right to feed your baby however you choose. BFH can get wrecked.", "NTA. the fact you even have to ASK this is so sad.", "Sweet Jesus you can feed your child anyway you want ESPECIALLY in your own home ESPECIALLY in your own nursery! \n\nYour friends husband is so wildly out of line, you should go no contact with both of them until he apologizes completely and unreservedly \n\nNTA. Very much so.", "I completely agree with your husband I\u2019m happy he\u2019s has your back ! Im not going to lie your best-friend and her husband need to be cut off immediately. And I hope they know it\u2019s a law now for mothers to be able to nurse whenever they want even in a daycare center . I\u2019m an educator so mothers breastfeeding in a setting is normal . \n\nWhat you did was reasonable and away from the party goers ; don\u2019t let this upset you cause you made a positive choice to have privacy with you and your baby  ! Good job mom \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA obviously. You went inside your home to a private room to feed your baby as nature intended\n\nHe went snooping and came across you doing this and then is trying to gaslight everyone into this being your underhanded attempt to flash him?", "You would have been NTA even if you'd publicly fed your son in full view of guests. JFC, people have to stop sexualising breastfeeding, and, while they're at it, breasts in general, to this extent.", "NTA\n\nWho does this man think he is?!?! I think he was overcompensating for having seen your boobs, because he was snooping. \n\nYou were feeding your infant in your nursery in your house, what kind of mental gymnastics did he do to get to these conclusions?\n\nYou should respond telling him your were breastfeeding in an appropriate place and that HE was the one snooping other rooms.\n\nHe doesn't want to take accountability after getting caught.\n\nWild.", "NTA - it's so unbelievable to me that people still get upset about this. Feeding a baby is the most normal thing, the damn thing has to eat! It's not exposing yourself, that guy is just so used to sexualizing breasts.", "NTA.  You were feeding your child in a private room when your friend's husband opened the door.  Not sure how he concludes you are setting a bad example for your son . . . by feeding him.   Not sure how he spun it to himself as to conclude that you deliberately showed him your breasts, when he was the one who intruded on you.", "Have you blasted him in that group chat ?  Snooping at the very least. There must be something along the lines of invasion of privacy , or just accuse him of following you, and see how he feels about being accused.

You should report him op.", "NTA. First you\u2019re allowed to breastfeed wherever you want however you want. Second you were in your house inside a closed room.

Btw: you are feeding your baby in a normal healthy way.", "NTA - you need to let the group chat know what really happened.           \nEven if you have to say \u2018I\u2019m sorry if I offended you when you opened the closed door to my baby\u2019s nursery and saw me breastfeeding my baby\u2019", "NTA - respond with \"wait a damn minute!

You knew where the bathroom was - why were you going around my home opening doors that you had no business opening?!\"\n\nWhat an absolute jerk", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, he is a guest and should act like one. He sounds manipulative and narcissistic. I suggest just breaking friendship with your best friend since he already did her brainwash about this whole situation. You were sitting privately in your own house feeding your baby, nothing is wrong with that.", "I'm guessing that dude knew where the bathrooms were and is being a dick for attention or some other reason. Make himself look better or whatever.", "NTA. BFH has issues.", "NTA. Do not allow him to make you feel any other way. It was in your home away from all guests. He snooped, I imagine he would have known where the bathroom was? \n\nWatch how your friend reacts when she eventually responds to your messages. Her BF has gone insane.", "NTA. You are feeding him in the most natural and healthy way. But to BFH that probably means the baby formula way. I wonder how he thinks babies were fed before this formula way became the norm.", "NTA and you need to send a very stern response that it is inappropriate to snoop around other people's homes and he invaded a nursing mother's privacy with his nosiness.The audacity of this man! He should be begging your forgiveness.", "NTA. Even if you had breastfed your child in a living room. Nothing wrong with that.", "NTA\n\nWhat's his business snooping around in your house?", "Certified NTA. BF's husband gets the AH crown for discovering your private feeding and freaking out.  Does a man that age really not know the difference between feeding a baby and an \"exhibition\"?  A normal person would discreetly back out apologizing, saying nothing.", "He\u2019s a pervert. NTA", "Nta \n\nhe walked in on you  and is making it sound as though you made an advance towards him although I\u2019m curious what had your husband said about all this?", "NTA, your friend's husband should apologize to you.", "NTA\n\nRespond in the group chat with exactly what happened. Ask why he was opening closed doors in your home. What was he looking for, and it wasn\u2019t the bathroom? \n\nI\u2019d take a break from this friend, and pay attention if mutual friends start acting strangely towards you and/or makes comments. Set them straight immediately.", "You did nothing wrong and definitely NTA. Why was he snooping around you house and entering rooms he had no need to be in. I hope your husband is backing you up here and telling this guy how wrong he is.  You can feed your child however you choose, especially in your own home. Nothing about breastfeeding is indecent, it\u2019s a perfectly appropriate and natural way to feed a child. I\u2019m so angry for you. How dare he!", "So that shady asshole was snooping round your home, found you breastfeeding your baby then acts like you chased him down and stuck your boobs in his face? And your friend believed whatever shit he made up? What? \n\nHow could you be the asshole when you've done nothing wrong? Try get your friend to meet up and tell her exactly what you were doing and question what HE was doing snooping. If she's still on his side then she's as much of an asshole as he is.\n\nNTA", "NTA you were not indecent you were nursing in a private space and he walked in", "NTA, you could have been in the backyard with everyone else feeding him and still wouldn't have been. I'm so sorry that this person has made you feel like this.", "NTA He just turned feeding a baby in your own home into something sexual. He is TA.", "NTA. Keep him out of your life. Dude's garbage.", "So you fed your son in your home in his nursery and you are \"exposing\" yourself to him? Also breastfeeding is not a normal and healthy way to feed a 5 month old? What planet is this guy from? This is nature's way of feeding your child. So much so that if a Mother wasn't capable of feeding her children (or didn't want to ) wet nurses were hired. \n\nAs for your friend....she's either in an abusive realtionship where he won't let her talk to you or she is a AH also for not supporting you. She's a woman she knows how the body works.", "NTA breastfeeding is natural and I\u2019m so sorry this experience has made you feel you ought to make concessions to other people even when in your own home! \n\nWhy on earth was he opening random doors in your house??? That should be the key point here! If they can\u2019t talk sense and apologise to you for wondering around, disrespecting your privacy and making a scene, then I think you\u2019d be better off without them.", "Breastfeeding is not indecent please cut this so called friends off", "If you wanted to you could have fed your child outside around other people and still be NTA. The fact that you went inside for some privacy doesn\u2019t change that you were feeding your child! \nAnd the fact that he saw/ got annoyed by it is his problem not yours", " He is virtue signalling and he is the AH. He got caught snooping and trying to blame you.", "NTA. He is deflecting and HARD. \n\nHe was either snooping round your house (nasty) or deliberately looking for you (creepy and nasty). There is no reasonable explanation as to why he walked in on you whilst you were feeding your son behind a closed door unless he genuinely thought that your nursery was the bathroom.   So he needs to attack you to avoid answering about what the hell he was doing in the first place.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. You were in your house feeding your baby. This man is a creep.", "NTA. This is insane. Your friend needs to date someone that\u2019s not such a creep.", "I think he was trying to steal from you, or find out something private.\n\nWith closed doors to private rooms, I'm guessing he was looking for your bedroom, and accidentally got the nursery instead.\n\nAnd now he's trying to cover it up by accusing you of perversion and coming onto him (and I'm sure he's told his wife some different tale), before you can tell everyone and accuse him of whatever he thought you figured out he was doing.\n\nNTA. He knows you feeding a baby in a room he wasn't supposed to be in is hardly the same as you coming onto him.\n\nDon't apologise to him or his wife. This was super shady. Simply ask him in the group chat why he came into your babys bedroom when he knew that was neither the bathroom/living room/kitchen, and that you had left the party to feed. I think he's terrified of someone asking him that because he can't think of a valid excuse.", "NTA. BFH is using the tactic \u2018offence is the best for of defence\u2019. He knows he\u2019s in the wrong. He was snooping and / or looking for some titty thrills. He\u2019s now deflecting his inappropriate behaviour onto you. \n\nI would clarify the situation on the group text. Stating that you were feeding your baby in an appropriate manner. Breasts are for feeding babies after all. \n\nYour baby will not grow up to be a pervert, however BFH sexualising a 5 month old baby is very disturbing. \n\nI doubt you\u2019re going to keep your friend though.", "NTA. You also weren't 'indecently exposed'. \n\nThis man is no friend. He got busted somewhere he shouldn't have been, and is deflecting hard. \n\nAre you missing any cash, jewellery, electronics, personal identification etc?", "NTA\n\nPutting aside that women should be able to breastfeed wherever they want, especially in their own home\n\nYou deliberately went to a private room so that you DIDN'T \"expose yourself\" or \"behave inappropriately in front of guests.\" Everything would have been fine if he hadn't gone where he wasn't welcome. If you were \"exposed\" he's the one who exposed you. If he had pulled down your pants while you were in the garden would he have complained about you not being dressed properly?\n\nAsk him what he was doing in the nursery while you were feeding in the first place.", "Nta. Your husband is right. He lost his damn mind somewhere in the process of searching for the bathroom", "NTA I would message your best friend and tell her to get her husband into line with a full apology from him and a promise from her to not bring him around ever again.

You weren't exposing yourself to him, you found some privacy and he was snooping (why?)\n\n2. If you've got a good latch, the nipple shouldn't be visible while feeding anyway\n\n3. Breastfeeding isn't deviant, you are in your own house feeding your child.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It is not possible to be indecently exposed when breast feeding a baby.

Don\u2019t ever message me again and if \u201cfriend name\u201d thinks this is ok then it\u2019s no loss cutting her out too.\u201d", "NTA!! Your best friend is a TERRIBLE friend for allowing her husband to treat you this way.", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA. Breastfeeding is not sexual or exposing yourself. \n\nMy ex-girlfriend used to breastfeed everywhere, and if men were staring, would loudly ask - are you getting a good view, buddy?

NTA.", "Wow, did he ever like seeing your breasts! The amount of over reacting he is doing makes me think he feels guilt for liking what he saw, and is over compensating by trying to prove to his wife that it's all your fault he saw anything.\n\nOr he's just a straight-up nosy A who can't accept breasts are not actually for men, and instead feed babies. You were hiding away in the nursery for Pete's sake! \n\nNTA, not even a little bit.", "NTA.

The dude is a perv. He followed her.", "His version of the story: I was making my way directly to the bathroom when your friend jumped out in front of me topless and jiggling her breasts seductively!", "I agree ; what he did was so wrong and he\u2019s know it\u2019s  !", "Especially in a house that doesn't belong to you.", "NC even if he apologizes.", "I also wonder if BFH has been caught doing this before? Hence the rush to accuse OP of being purposely indecent to him.", "I suppose I would be tempted to respond that you found him physically disgusting and that it is spooky that he sneaked about your house."]}
