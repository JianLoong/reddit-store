Our baby is amazing, and we are so in love with him.\n\nAfter the birth, we only allowed our parents/siblings to see the baby so that we could have some time to settle into our new lives. We didn't want to be overrun with visitors, but decided to host a BBQ this weekend so some more extended family and friends could meet baby. It went really well, and everyone was so over the moon to see the little one. I would like to clarify, this wasn't a huge gathering, maybe only 10 people.\n\nAt one point, I took baby inside for his lunch. I am nursing him at the moment, so I went to his nursery so we could have some privacy. As most people were in the backyard, I thought that this would be a quiet spot for the two of us.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, my best friend's (F27) husband (M29) needed the bathroom at some point and came into the house. I think he was having a bit of a snoop around because he ended up opening the door to the nursery where I was with the baby (which is nowhere near the bathroom), and inevitably found us. He was quite shocked and fumbled his words a little bit before closing the door and leaving. I was not very happy that this had happened because I had specifically gone looking for a quiet moment so baby could eat, but it is what it is and I thought it was over.\n\nWhen I walked out of the house a little while later, I was surprised to see that my best friend and her husband had left. My husband tells me that when best-friend's-husband (BFH) came out of the house, he immediately reprimanded my husband for the fact that I was exposing myself and acting inappropriately in front of guests. Of course, my husband was very confused by what was going on, but BFH basically just grabbed my friend and the two of them left leaving everyone else quite stunned.\n\nA few hours after everyone had gone home, BFH started a group chat with myself, my husband, and my best friend, and basically said that he could not believe how I had exposed myself to him today when I knew he was happily married, and that I should have more shame. He said that I was not setting a good example for my son, who would grow up as some kind of deviant because I am refusing to feed him in a \"normal and healthy way\".\n\nI am honestly quite upset about the whole thing, and no one has responded (my best friend has not even opened any of my other messages), but I wonder if maybe I should have just gone with a bottle feed during the event so that this never would have happened. My husband thinks BFH has lost his mind, but I wonder, was I the AH?", "created_utc": 1688890217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14usthg/aita_for_being_indecently_exposed_while_feeding/", "score": 6865, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A raging loser?\n\nYour poor friend. \n\nI have to wonder if he is just making up random stuff so he can force your friend to not see you again. Abusers isolate their victims from friends.

Also insane. My BF would freak out if her husband said some shit like that to me", "NTA- in my book you would have been well within your rights to have whipped a titty out in the middle of the bbq to feed the baby, so the fact that you went out of your way to be in a private space to feed him means you did everything reasonable to be decent.

I was completely incredulous + we both told her that this is what her body is made to do, there\u2019s nothing sexual or shameful about feeding a child!! Get your tits out girl, feed that baby! We carried on a completely normal conversation around her breastfeeding and it was so unremarkable that neither of us even mentioned it once she\u2019d left. It\u2019s natural. \n\nOP went out of her way for privacy and BFH knew exactly what he was doing when he opened the nursery door while Mom was missing with Baby.

In places like European countries there things like beach nudity are seen as completely normal, it's seen as no big deal.

The fact that women are shamed for doing what is normal and natural and has been since people existed is horrible. I'll admit breast feeding was not something I was really good at. I pumped and ended up using formula starting at 6 weeks with each of my kids. It had nothing to do with shame. It had nothing to do with outside pressure. I was fortunate to be supported by both men and women in my life. \n\nPeople that try and convince young people that basic care and feeding of an infant are somehow perverts is disgusting.", "I think part of it is really that, for a few generations, bottle feeding was really pushed and glorified. Now we are doing the work of de-stigmatizing the very natural (and healthier!) process of breastfeeding.", "I feel that it's really an American puritanical view of public nudity. Even though a mother nursing an infant is normal and natural, people get weirded out. It disrupts some people's ability to sexualize the female body. Nursing in your own home, behind a closed door, even with guests in the house is also normal. OPs friends husband was being shady and awful no matter what his intentions originally were.", "Considering how many kids those mormons have, it's not at all surprising.", "Same in Indiana. \n\n*nice avatar!"]}
