She's a single mother of two twin boys (8M). \n\nI live alone with my cat, but I have a pretty good job that makes it so I can afford nice 4 bedroom house. Since I have room, I decided to let Laila and the boys move in until she can find another apartment/job. \n\nI only have a few rules for them, mostly basic stuff like if you break something pay me back, keep things clean, stuff like that. Except there's one rule that they seem to be having trouble with. I told Laila that no matter the circumstances, do not ever let my cat into the garden.\n\nMy cat is VERY prone to eating stuff he isn't supposed to, and that includes the flowers in my garden. One time I accidentally let him out, and he chewed through some of them completely, so then I decided to just put him in my room whenever I go to garden.\n\nA few weeks ago, when I was at work, Laila told me the boys had accidentally let him into the garden. Thankfully he didn't get out or anything, but he destroyed some of my roses again. I told Laila to put him in my room next time the boys went out to the garden, and she told me she would.\n\nLo and behold, a week or so later, he gets into the garden again. My garden is pretty big so I was pretty worried when I couldn't find him. Thankfully after a few minutes of panic I found him hiding behind a large bush, so he was fine. Scared me to death though, so I told Laila if it happened again they could find another place to live.\n\nShe got pretty mad at me and told me it was an \"accident\", so I should \"just chill out\". I don't think it's that hard to put a cat in a room while you're in the garden, I do it all the time.\n\nI thought Laila had gotten the picture after that, because she listened to me and started shutting him in my room. But around two days ago, he got out again. This time he actually did escape and I had to track him down. When I got home Laila just said she was \"so sorry\", and that she just \"forgot\" to put him in my room.\n\nI was furious at this point, I mean, how hard is it to put a cat in a god-damned room???? I told her that she better start packing her stuff because I was not going to let her keep putting my cat's health in danger because she just couldn't bring herself to lock a fucking room.\n\nMy parents don't have room for them all at their house, so Laila is staying with them while her ex husband took the boys. She's pissed at me for \"kicking her out over nothing\", and my mom is too, but my dad thinks she deserved it. AITA for kicking her out?

All she had to do was follow the rules and everything would have been fine.  Frankly, it's probably best the boys are with their dad.  Does she even watch them?  Or just let them out and let them wander around on their own, possibly even out into traffic?\n\nYou were very generous letting them move in.  You had very basic rules to follow.  When my cats stay with my parents, if Felix the Fearless gets out, my dad goes all out nuts trying to get him back in the house.  My mother has realized that Felix likes dirt baths (the soil where they live is very sandy and my dad is a gardener so there's also stray potting soil around).  Felix goes out the back door and works his way around front, flopping in every sandy/soily patch he finds between the back and front of the house.  While Dad panics and forms a rescue posse, Mom stands by the front door and opens it when Felix strolls up.  Felix is an escape artist, so I kind of expect this sort of thing.  I know Houdini had nothing on Felix.  I've literally watched Felix escape a locked room.  That's not the case with your cat.\n\nYour mom and your sister are clueless.  Stick with your Dad.", "YTA \n\nShe\u2019s probably protecting her two eight year olds from getting kicked out. Eight year olds aren\u2019t the best at remembering every step when it\u2019s already a totally new environment. Even adults forget every detail. Especially trying to keep two boys from destroying her sister\u2019s house. This woman has a lot going on and chasing down a cat to go in the garden is probably not in the top list ten of things she needs to do to survive her situation. Give her some slack.", "ESH I think you\u2019ve taken the nuclear option and it will damage your relationship with your sister and possibly your whole family. One solution could be to simply ban garden access while they\u2019re staying there. Just lock the door to the garden. Or install a self-closing screen door at your sister\u2019s expense. Do you never open your windows? How do you stop the cat climbing out of an open window?\n \nAt least help your sister find somewhere else to live. Throwing her and her children out (with nowhere to go?) over three cat-in-the-garden transgressions without at least looking for other solutions is extreme, in my opinion.", "I get it. And I'll be downvoted but maybe OP you'll hear me. I have a beloved cat. We don't want him out but my husband is adamant. We also have kids. It can be really hard to keep a cat in that wants to get out. Ours is like Houdini. With kids sometimes it is hard to find and take the car to another room every time you need to open the door a minute. Ours sometimes lurks under the furniture and we don't even know he is there.", "This, she should apologize again and find a way to remember to put the cat in the room if OP agrees to try one more time. The fact she says it is nothing tells she won't change and will let the cat escape again if she gets another chance.", "And three chances.", "They didn't help me find him once.", "I thought Laila had gotten the picture after that, because she listened to me and started shutting him in my room.", "I\u2019m in a large subdivision, 60k+ people, very developed.\n\nWe still have coyotes around here \u2014 one poor lady had a coyote come up and grab her toy poodle right in front of her while out on a walk. Plus feral hogs, owls, and sightings of a bobcat. And of course stray or uncontrolled dogs.\n\nYeaaaah my cats get their \u201coutdoor exposure\u201d by hanging out in the windows.

If THEY'RE  letting the cat out there are far bigger problems with her sister i believe.", "I don\u2019t know what eight year olds you\u2019ve been around, but every eight year old kid I\u2019ve seen KNOWS how to follow directions. It\u2019s if they choose to that\u2019s the problem. Children are smarter than they let on, and her sister could\u2019ve told her kids to leave the cat alone. She was given ONE rule and constantly broke it.\n\nWhat would you say if the cat ate a plant that was poisonous to it? \u201cOh well you can\u2019t blame the kids for forgetting\u201d?", "They were given plenty of chances to comply, not like the first time it happened they were out on their asses. The time to protect her children was when she was warned that further non-compliance with the rules of the house would result in them needing to find somewhere else to live. Maybe chasing the cat down should have been higher on her list of priorities since that is a known condition of continuing to live there. She had plenty of slack already.", "If OP's sister can't manage to follow the \"don't let the cat out\" rule, why on earth would she follow the \"don't go in the garden at all\" rule?\n\nThey don't have nowhere to go, it's in the last paragraph. Try reading the whole post.", "OP is aware the cat isn't in danger in her garden, he's just going to destroy her roses if allowed to.  Yeah, her sister needs to get her act together and figure out how to support herself, but choosing eviction without notice because of some damaged flowers once a week is extremely harsh.\n\nThat definitely damaged the relationship long term.", "She got three chances already.
