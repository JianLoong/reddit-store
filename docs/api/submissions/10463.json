Except there's one rule that they seem to be having trouble with. I told Laila that no matter the circumstances, do not ever let my cat into the garden.\n\nMy cat is VERY prone to eating stuff he isn't supposed to, and that includes the flowers in my garden. One time I accidentally let him out, and he chewed through some of them completely, so then I decided to just put him in my room whenever I go to garden.\n\nA few weeks ago, when I was at work, Laila told me the boys had accidentally let him into the garden. Thankfully he didn't get out or anything, but he destroyed some of my roses again. I told Laila to put him in my room next time the boys went out to the garden, and she told me she would.\n\nLo and behold, a week or so later, he gets into the garden again. My garden is pretty big so I was pretty worried when I couldn't find him. Thankfully after a few minutes of panic I found him hiding behind a large bush, so he was fine.

I don't think it's that hard to put a cat in a room while you're in the garden, I do it all the time.\n\nI thought Laila had gotten the picture after that, because she listened to me and started shutting him in my room. But around two days ago, he got out again. This time he actually did escape and I had to track him down. When I got home Laila just said she was \"so sorry\", and that she just \"forgot\" to put him in my room.\n\nI was furious at this point, I mean, how hard is it to put a cat in a god-damned room????
