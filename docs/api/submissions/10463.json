Since I have room, I decided to let Laila and the boys move in until she can find another apartment/job. \n\nI only have a few rules for them, mostly basic stuff like if you break something pay me back, keep things clean, stuff like that.

One time I accidentally let him out, and he chewed through some of them completely, so then I decided to just put him in my room whenever I go to garden.\n\nA few weeks ago, when I was at work, Laila told me the boys had accidentally let him into the garden. Thankfully he didn't get out or anything, but he destroyed some of my roses again. I told Laila to put him in my room next time the boys went out to the garden, and she told me she would.\n\nLo and behold, a week or so later, he gets into the garden again. My garden is pretty big so I was pretty worried when I couldn't find him. Thankfully after a few minutes of panic I found him hiding behind a large bush, so he was fine. Scared me to death though, so I told Laila if it happened again they could find another place to live.\n\nShe got pretty mad at me and told me it was an \"accident\", so I should \"just chill out\". I don't think it's that hard to put a cat in a room while you're in the garden, I do it all the time.\n\nI thought Laila had gotten the picture after that, because she listened to me and started shutting him in my room.

When I got home Laila just said she was \"so sorry\", and that she just \"forgot\" to put him in my room.\n\nI was furious at this point, I mean, how hard is it to put a cat in a god-damned room???? I told her that she better start packing her stuff because I was not going to let her keep putting my cat's health in danger because she just couldn't bring herself to lock a fucking room.\n\nMy parents don't have room for them all at their house, so Laila is staying with them while her ex husband took the boys. She's pissed at me for \"kicking her out over nothing\", and my mom is too, but my dad thinks she deserved it. AITA for kicking her out? She's been calling me a monster for separating her and her kids.\n\nEDIT: Some people are asking so I just want to say, she's never had a problem with my cat before. Sometimes I even send her videos of my niece playing with him and she's never indicated she felt negatively towards him or anything. She usually just responds with \"Awww so cute\" or something like that.

Any cat that resource guards food will resource guard cat grass. \n\nIt's often easier to grow in small flower pots regardless, in which case you want one per cat at first as two cats will decimate all the grass very quickly. If one of the cats shows no interest, then you just subtract that from the best batch. \n\nMy recommendation would be this: \n\n1. Buy solid pots, unless you're willing to sit there and hold the plastic/lightweight pot. They *will* drag lightweight pots on to the side while munching. I usually hold it while scrolling my phone because I prefer plastic pots for ease.\n\n2. Buy two pots per cat (who wants any). When one is ready for eating, plant the second one. Cat grass takes about 10-14 days to grow in. By the time they nibble plant one to death, the second will be ready. \n\n3. Give each cat a chance to eat the grass in a closed room by themselves. It's more work, but then there'll be no fighting over who gets the grass first. \n\n4. Do not free feed it. Cats like the texture/taste but cannot digest it well. A cat who eats too much grass will throw up -- that's actually what they eat grass for in the wild. Your cat is not wild and will want to eat it even when they don't need to throw up. \n\n5. If one cat is extra into one week (more into it than they usually are), they're likely experiencing stomach issues. If that keeps going for multiple weeks a vet check would be a good idea. \n\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to ask. My little chaos goblins are spoiled af."]}
