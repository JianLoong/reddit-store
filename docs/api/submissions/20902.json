You could\u2019ve been gentler, sure. But this is a reality of many pet owners. As an emergency veterinarian, this is a discussion I have often. I need owners to consider their quality of lives along with the quality of life of their pets. Does it sound selfish? Maybe. But it\u2019s not. You should not stop your life for a pet, you shouldn\u2019t be worried about traveling, living, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s hard. Especially when they\u2019re young and when there\u2019s \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d but you\u2019ve put in more than what a lot of other pet owners would. You\u2019ve tried and you love her a lot it sounds like. This will be hard for everyone to come to terms with because she\u2019s young, she\u2019s otherwise healthy, you\u2019ve invested money and emotions since that initial diagnosis, etc.\n\nMaybe reaching out to rescues prior and having meetings with the coordinators as a family can help? Maybe ask the rescue about counseling services available near you that may be helpful for your wife. This way you can get any questions and concerns out of the way. I\u2019m really sorry your family is experiencing this. It\u2019s a hard decision to come to terms with, but I think it may be best for your family (based on what you\u2019ve described).", "NAH. This is a hard situation. I would genuinely look into seeing if there are rescues or resources where people accept dogs with special needs. \n\nPutting the dog down is a last resort.", "NAH- Y'all need to do what's best for your dog. That may mean giving her to someone who can care for her or putting the dog down.", "nah \nthis is a painful time \namd it is clear that you wife loved her dog very much - i would suggest some grief counselling sessions for her (to come to terms) and you to be supportive.  there are very few rescues or people that can manage a dog like this - some can but you would have to be very careful about who would take her so she didn't end up in a hoarder situation.", "NTA\n\nIts a horrible thing but the lesser of two evils.  Its not nice for the dog either and she isn't ever going to get any better.  \n\nVery sad situation but you seem to have exhausted all avenues to help her and now only really have one option left.", "This is a tough one for me because I had to have my little buddy put down in November.  He had a slipped disc. He was an adopted brindle pug, and the vet did not give him a very good chance of ever regaining full use of his back end.  He was still able to walk and run, although his little back legs would give out on him sometimes. He would even jump up in my lap on his good days, but he had lost the ability to know when he needed to go to the bathroom.\n\nI eventually made the decision because he appeared to be in pain on many days towards the end, and it caused him to become aggressive towards our other dogs. It was the hardest decision I have ever had to make, and my wife, who is in a similar situation as you, was the one who finally opened my eyes to what needed to be done.\n\nThat being said, I think NAH. I think maybe the subject should be handled with a little more compassion, but if the dog does not have the same quality of life anymore, then maybe it's time. In my case, I think I prolonged the decision for many more months than I should have, and only now looking back do I see how much his quality of life had diminished.\n\nHowever, I also don't know what your home schedule is like. My buddy came to work with me every day, so I would take him out every couple of hours and he knew that that was when he should go to the bathroom. If the loss of the ability to know when the dog needs to pee or poop is the only problem, I would strongly urge you to rehome to someone who may be able to handle a schedule in which they could take the dog out every couple of hours. If, of course, that is the only issue.", "NTA, it is cruel of her for wanting the dog to live like that.", "Sounds like the dog needs to live somewhere with a temperate climate and become an outside dog?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You snapped in a difficult situation and admit your tone was wrong.\n\nHave you tried Chiropractor, Acupuncture and Cold Laser Therapy?  They can do wonders for dogs with spinal problems like yours.", "I'm sorry for you both and your poor pup. \n\nThe next time family reaches out to berate you, ask them when you can schedule them to babysit the pup at their house for a weekend so your wife (and you) can take a much needed break.\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m so sorry for this difficult situation, and for what you, your wife and your dog are going through. \n\nPerhaps UTIs can be avoided with more frequent changing of the diaper? \n\nCan she be on preventative antibiotics? I normally am really against that sort of thing because of the side effects and chances of increasing antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but I have to think this issue has been addressed by vets before so there must be something they can do. \n\nIs there a way to time meals and outside time to maximize the chances the dog will pee/poop outside? \n\nCranberry works for people with UTIs. Can it work for dogs? \n\nI\u2019m basically advocating for being as creative as possible to maximize the quality of life for all of you. Obviously it would be extremely traumatic to lose the dog, but it\u2019s really important for the dog to have a good life too. \n\nNAH IF you exhaust all options. If you have, then have the vet explain to your wife about the quality of life issue. People will sometimes listen to a third party even though the spouse said the same thing.\n\nETA it looks like expressing the urine regularly can help prevent UTIs. And expressing the bowels can reduce problems as well. \n\n\u201cPet diapers can be helpful in managing bowel incontinence, but they are only one part of a complete program of bowel care. Expressing the bowel is healthier for your pet than wearing a diaper. If you express your pet\u2019s bowel, feed your pet a diet that produces quality stools, and work with your pet\u2019s natural elimination schedule. Diapering may become unnecessary. It is also better for your pet\u2019s peace of mind because adult pets can smell waste even if they are unable to feel it.\u201d \n\nAnd \u201cWhen we diaper pets, we remove their natural ability to groom or clean this area, so it\u2019s your job as an owner to take time to brush the coat regularly, [g]ive your dog breaks from diapers, check for rashes, and make sure your pet is completely clean and dry before applying a new diaper.\u201d\n\nFrom https://www.handicappedpets.com/blog/pros-and-cons-of-diapering/#:~:text=Expressing%20the%20Bladder%20%26%20Diapers%3A%20Why%20Both%20Are%20Essential&text=Expressing%20the%20bladder%20is%20still,be%20enough%20to%20cause%20infection.\n\nIf your wife can and will do all of the necessary care likely five times a day, including expressing the urine, the bowels, cleaning the diaper area, changing the diaper, then theoretically there should not be UTIs or a mess all over the house. Vacations will require boarding at a vet\u2019s office so the dog can get the proper care.", "We had a rescue cat once who could not stop spraying (Bengal - as they are an undomesticated cross they are prone to it).  Did medication and everything, nothing worked, and we just had to live with cat pee smell and constant cleaning.  Otherwise he was truly the sweetest, silkiest cat ever. He died young from natural causes and I felt guilty but I was \\*so\\* relieved. I would not live like that again, it was too much.", "[deleted]", "Respectfully, you\u2019re wrong. As a veterinarian I can say this isn\u2019t a cruel existence. The dog is otherwise happy and healthy. She just needs a lot more care and time than this family is able to put towards her. The wife isn\u2019t being cruel, she\u2019s being human. It\u2019s hard for her to acknowledge that this is draining them and that she\u2019s serving from an empty cup currently. It\u2019s okay for her to be upset about it.", "What do you mean? The only issue with the dog is lack of control over bladder and bowels. The OP states that the dog is happy and healthy otherwise. In OP's own words she is a little ball of joy. The dog is happy, and while not completely healthy, she is ok. The only issue is the burden she places on her owners due to lack of control over bodily functions. So please don't imply cruelty towards the animal. She's not \"living like that\". According to the OP, she is happy and fine.", "I wish I could correct the title. I meant either put her down or give her away to someone who can care for her.", "Can you point to where I said it wasn't ok for her to feel the way she feels?", "She is happy with her situation. She will always be limited on what she can do (no jumping or rough playing with other dogs).", "It's okay OP. Caring for a special needs animal is exhausting. You snapping is completely understandable. It doesn't make you an asshole OP for sure. Your wife also just deeply cares about the animal.\n\nIn order to leave each other a satisfactory/ okay compromise, exploring rescues together might be a good idea. If no one takes the dog, then there's the hard conversation about euthanizing the animal.", "Where you said NTA which, in this sub, means the other party is. Otherwise you'd vote NAH.", "There are reasonable puppy pads that you can throw in the laundry. If you keep her confined to whatever room you guys are in at the time, she can hang out with you and then if she goes to the bathroom just chuck the pad on the laundry. Hey a few of them to always have them on hand. We did this when my previous dog was losing control of her bladder and it was awesome because she could still be on the furniture with us, still hang out with us, etc.", "Feelings don't make her an AH leading her family to believing he is some sort of monster because he acknowledges their dog has special needs that they might not be able to provide care for is what makes her an AH.", "Bring him to the vet, tell him to explain her that it's the end of the line and it would nicer to let him go. She maybe has to hear it from a doctor.", "YTA. The time to bring up putting your dog down is not in a moment of anger. It's obviously a hard topic that needs to be approached gently.", "NTA, she needs to realize that keeping the dog alive is selfish. Is it sad?  Yes but it is also unrealistic to keep the dog alive.", "NTA just like you \u201csnapped\u201d at your wife with reality. \u201cSnap\u201d at her family and tell them to butt out of you and your wife\u2019s and dog issues. You already have enough stress as a couple with a poor ailing dog to be taking in crap from other people who have no business getting involved.", "NTA it's horrible she would want the dog to go through that. Poor thing doesn't even know. Y'all legit can't afford to keep doing it."]}
