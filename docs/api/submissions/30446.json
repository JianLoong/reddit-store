I'm her whole world and while she's a high energy dog and gets long walks/runs/agility/training/playtime and tons of puzzle toys, I'm not the most interesting thing to be around 24/7 and short errands that she gets to go on if I have a co-pilot give a high yield in tail wags for the rest of the day. It's just that the last thing I need is some psychopath breaking my car window and getting bit because she thinks she's being attacked. Oddly, these are the same people in my area who would feel like it's really obnoxious and worth throwing a fit about the 30 seconds inside the gas station with a dog too. \n\nThey just want to be angry and there's no reasoning with them.", "While counterconditioning is useful, this probably isn\u2019t the best method. When a dog is as worked up as it sounds like this kid was, they\u2019re not learning. I don\u2019t think this did some huge harm to the dog, but it wasn\u2019t training either. Also a vet.", "It's so funny to me that people think I took her in the store. Are Walgreens and Starbucks with drive thrus uncommon or something?

But I\u2019m positive a worker would gladly hang out with your pupperoo outside and do what they could to keep them calm.

I've gotta file this one away in case I ever encounter a tik tok videographer in the future.", "This lady sounds like a real piece of work. No one spends more than a couple minutes in a gas station. It wasn\u2019t hot. She was the one agitating the dog.

It's like people all just decided at some point that their dogs should be welcome everywhere.", "Most Home Depots, and some TJ Maxx/Marshall's/Home Goods allow dogs as well.", "I'd find my boy sitting, probably in the shade, a couple hundred yards down the road. Nobody chooses to listen to his yaps, cries & quiver lipped whines.", "We made a sign for the kitchen that says \"do not listen to the cat.

It's so annoying on the rare occasion when you see dogs in the grocery store.", "People bring their pets anyway and the employees rarely do anything about it.

She wasn't 5 seconds behind me; that's how fast a Jack Russell can bite through a leash.", "I have a Great Dane so there's not much she can safely be tied to. She's dragged heavy signs and vending machines along before. If I leave her in the car for a few moments, she starts trying to lick and nibble her way out of the window.
