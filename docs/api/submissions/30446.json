I pick up prescriptions from Walgreens and go to Starbucks afterwards. I always bring my dog with me because she gets treats and a pup cup. \n\nOn the way home I stopped at Kwik Trip for gas. I was planning on doing pay at the pump but the card reader was down. In hindsight I could've pulled around to another pump since it was slow but I didn't think of that at the time. I decided to run in pre-pay. \n\nMy dog is a rescue and has separation anxiety. Whenever I leave the space she's in, whether it's leaving my house or getting out of the car while she's in it, she cries. Her cries are loud and high pitched too, she sounds a lot like a laughing hyena. She started crying as soon as I got out, but I was close to the store entrance and there wasn't a line. I was in and out quickly. All the windows were cracked open and I had calming music on for her. \n\nWhen I got back to my car there was a woman recording my dog. She was right up against my window too, which was making my dog even more upset. Before I could say anything, she pointed her phone at me and said \"is this your dog?\" I said \"..yes?\" She said \"it's been barking for FIFTEEN MINUTES, why do you think it's ok to abandon your dog like that?\" I checked my phone to see how long I was gone and said \"it was less than 3 minutes. I appreciate your concern, but you're upsetting my dog. Please back up\". At this point my dog thinks this woman is a threat and starts actually barking. The woman says \"well I don't care how long it's been! This is going on tiktok, I hope your boss sees it!\" I said \"neat, I'm sure your 4 followers will be outraged\" \n\nThis next part is what made me want to post this here. She said \"you're a shitty pet owner who abandoned her dog outside. You heard her crying and didn't care. I hope you feel terrible!\" That actually did make me feel terrible. Am I a bad person because I left my dog alone, knowing that she has separation anxiety? Am I just telling myself \"it was only 2 and a half minutes\" to justify my actions?

Seeing a dog in a car at the gas station is no big deal. The average person doesn\u2019t tend to stay at a gas pump for extended periods of time. Even if your car had broken down, it\u2019s likely that the car was the safest place for your dog at that time. This lady just sounds nuts and like she\u2019s not a dog owner herself.

Trying to get someone doxxed and ruin their life over something like this is insane behavior.", "NTA\n\nIt was a few minutes and she sounds like trying to cause drama for tik tok.\n\nMaybe you should have finished with \"like and subscribe\"", "NTA.

We go to check out and the clerk says there\u2019s an officer at our car waiting to speak to us. Wondering whats going on, we approach him and he tells us that someone gave them a call about a dog in a hot car with the windows up. He was visibly annoyed with the call and said he didn\u2019t see anything wrong as it wasn\u2019t even hot, and just recommended cracking the windows a bit so they have no reason to call.\n\nI think what happened was she started barking as they walked by and they didn\u2019t like it, so they called the police.", "NTA\n\nYou're fine.", "Some rando who cares more about hopping on the fame train of TikTok than the actual dog.

I have left my dog, who screeches and screams for no reason, just whenever she isn\u2019t getting her way - to the point the vet office has to apologize to other people and promise they aren\u2019t hurting her - in the car alone at a gas station to run in and get food. I would apologize if someone confronted me and said it wad annoying, but that\u2019s probably all that would happen. Lol", "If they have no idea, that doesn\u2019t justify making up a lie. If you\u2019re concerned, wait quietly, away from the car and take action when there is actual cause to do so.", "Well, seeing as it was a gas station where people are typically in and out in less than 5 minutes, the bystander actually did have a pretty good idea how long OP was gone.", "Okay, but\u2026 realistically, OP was at a gas pump, not a store/restaurant/other venue where there\u2019s room for reasonable concern about how long the dog was alone. Given the location of where this happened, there\u2019s really only so long that they could\u2019ve been gone. Even if they went to the toilet, grabbed a snack, and waited in line, that\u2019s \u2014 what? 10 minutes max? Unless OP is in the southern hemisphere, it\u2019s generally cool enough at this point in the year that a dog can hang out in a car for 10 minutes without nosy randos getting into an uproar.", "So you shouldn't leave them at home either? \nAre dogs really that needy? \n\nI'm a cat owner but I've sat for dogs as well....and I've also seen plenty of dogs sitting in cars outside of target being totally chill....\n\nYour dog should be totally capable of being alone for a few minutes in a car. It should be totally capable of being alone for a few hours in your home without barking all day or destroying things.\n\nIf your dog isn't capable of that right now it means it needs additional training and socialization. There is nothing wrong with that but like....dogs should never be left unattended? That's a little too much.", "If dogs weren\u2019t meant to be left unattended no one would have one.", "This is laughable", "Okay so this might be a hot take but... I'd say the lady is absolutely TA, and you are very slightly TA. \n\nSeparation anxiety is mental and physical distress. Giving her objects to distract when you leave her is just management and does not actually fix the problem. This is demonstrated in her screaming behaviour with you leaving her for only three minutes. SA is a really tough one to fix but you owe it to your dog to do actual active behaviour modification not just passive management. If leaving for three minutes causes her this much distress, imagine what she goes through when you go to work. Or out with friends to a no-dogs-allowed event. It is not fair to your dog to *know* she has this issue and do nothing to actually fix it.\n\nStepping off my sopbox now.\n\nThe lady was absolutely out of line. Massive overreaction on her part, the filming and posting to attempt to shame is ridiculous. (If only she knew what travel looks like for people deep into dog sports and conformation showing - she may actually just stroke out, even though \"dog world\" people take the absolute best care of their dogs.)", "Time to talk to a behavior specialist then, because separation anxiety is almost always an owner-created training issue. If an adult dog can't be left alone for a couple of hours during the day, it hasn't been trained properly. So many people adopted puppies during the height of the pandemic and have fucked up those poor dogs royally by being home with them every minute of every day."]}
