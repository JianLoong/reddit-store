She came out years ago, but honestly before she ever said anything to me, she made it clear as a child that she wanted very little to do with boys.\n\nMy half brother James and I reconnected about two years ago. We knew of each other as children, but I didn\u2019t know for sure that he and I shared the same dad. We ended up doing a dna test after our father died and confirmed that we were siblings.\nSo now we\u2019ve gotten to know one another again and we\u2019ve been slowly introducing our families to each other.\n\nHe has two kids that are just a few years younger than my daughter, so Eva was really excited about finally having some cousins closer to her age (the ones on her mom\u2019s side are significantly younger). She\u2019s also excited about getting to know more of my family since I\u2019m not very close with the rest of them.\n\nWe\u2019ve met up a few times and it\u2019s always gone well. Everyone gets along with each other. At dinner a little while ago, James joked that Eva\u2019s \u201cboyfriends\u201d would have to answer to me, her uncle, and her male cousins if they broke her heart. Eva just laughed a little and said that she wasn\u2019t concerned about boys so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that.\n\nLater when they were gone, she asked me if I knew how James and his family felt about the LGBTQ community. I told her that I wasn\u2019t sure because it had never come up, so then she asked me if I could find out for her. I said that she should just talk to them about it directly since she was the one with the question, but then she said that she didn\u2019t want to ask because she didn\u2019t know James as well as I did and it would probably be easier for me to bring it up instead.\n\nI ended up telling her that she can\u2019t expect me to do hard things for her just because she doesn\u2019t want to do them, and if she wants to tell my brother/his family that she\u2019s gay or even find out their opinions on LGBTQ people, then she should do that herself.\nI thought she had let it go, but she\u2019s been giving me the cold shoulder for a bit.\n\nMy ex wife actually called me earlier and told me I was being obtuse about the situation and that I actually should be willing to do this for our daughter.\n\nI feel that Eva disclosing her identity is a responsibility that should fall on her, and it\u2019s not my job to pave that road for her.\nEvidently my ex and Eva both think it is and that I\u2019m being insensitive as well, so I wanted some outside opinions.\n\nEdit:\n\nI love my daughter, and I\u2019m proud of her. Even in wanting her to find out about my brother\u2019s views on her own, I never would have left her to handle that without me at least in the room.\n\nReading the comments, I realize that I wasn\u2019t teaching her how to be independent and do things on her own, I was likely making her feel completely unsupported.\n\nI saw this as a facing her anxieties thing, instead of truly thinking about it as a safety issue. I should have tried to see it from her point of view, I recognize that, and I will do more to learn in the future. I\u2019m going to apologize to her, and ask how she wants to go about this.", "created_utc": 1674678773, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l8whv/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_she_cant_expect/", "score": 662, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People can completely change in their treatment of a person when they learn they aren't straight. I've seen the nicest people in my own family turn into the most hateful people the moment anything Rainbow comes up. You never know who bigots can be, and they are also capable of being the kindest and loving people to people they aren't hateful towards. \n\nYou're right in that it should be her responsibility to tell them, if she chooses. However, she is asking you as her parent to find out if these are safe people for her to be out to. One of the jobs of a parent is to protect their kids. She wants to know (rightfully so) if she comes out if the reaction is going to be ugly and upsetting or if it will go well. After all, this sounds like a newer familial bond and she may be looking to see if she should invest her time in building a relationship with them. If they turn out to be Westbro Baptist sympathizers, she may not want to invest into the relationship.", "YTA.  This isn't \"hard stuff\" this is making sure they are safe people to come out to.", "It is absolutely your job to protect your daughter. How have you been a parent for 17 years and not realize this? YTA", "Wow, YTA\n\nIt's YOUR half brother and someone you just reconnected with. She's asking you because YOU know him and she doesn't.\n\nQuit being so flippant and pandering.", "YTA. This is not a \u201cyou order your own meal\u201d or \u201cif you want to be good at something, practice\u201d sort of helpful lesson. This is an emotional (and possibly physical) safety issue. She\u2019s going to have plenty of chances to come out to people once she assesses the safety of it. This is a stranger. Help her assess the safety. \n\nAre you the one with a problem telling your brother your daughter is gay?", "Yes, YTA.\n\n\"I won't do the hard things for her\" is sound parenting for stuff like not writing her college essays for her or not waking her up to make sure she goes to her job on time. It's horrible parenting when she is legitimately worried about whether she'd face direct bigotry from people and is asking you, very nicely, as an adult she *should* be able to trust, to scope things out to make sure she can be safe and comfortable around people.\n\nE: Also, surely it isn't difficult for you to ask, right? Even ignoring the exact nature of the favor, if somebody asks you to do something that is very difficult for them and very easy for you, it's pretty rude to not oblige *solely* so they have to do the difficult task. Would you refuse to grab something from the top shelf at a grocery store for somebody in a mobility scooter so they could learn a hard lesson?", "YTA, I can't stress this enough. She is not asking for you to see if she'd be comfortable, she's asking for you to see if she'd be safe. This is something your daughter is right to be scared of. Bigotry is not kiddie shit, and it can bring a deep ugliness and cruelty out of people who you never thought were capable of such a thing. Scoping out the situation for her is not the same as holding your kid's hand because she's scared of going to the dentist. You are making sure she's safe. In refusing to do this for her, you are communicating to her that her safety is not your concern. That her safety is an inconvenience to you. She will remember that for the rest of her life. \n\nIf you want to genuinely support your daughter, do this for her. Keep doing this for her. Don't hold it above her head, ever. It may sound like a stupid hassle for you, but you need to understand that every time she outs herself, she's sticking her neck out. She can get hurt, physically and psychologically and financially. One day, she will. Protect her while you still can.", "Damn dude, YTA. She's still just a kid and she doesn't want to get outright rejected. You don't know what it's like to say you're gay and have someone go off the deep end telling you how you're a mistake and going straight to hell. People get killed or beaten over the fact they are part of the LGBTQ+ community. All she's asking is for you to feel out the situation before she comes out to them. God forbid you try to make her anxiety less just because she's 17. Support your kid.", "YTA \nSo disclosing her identity is her thing. She can decides to whom she wants to \u2018out\u2019 herself. \nHowever, that is not, what she asked you to do. She asked you to check out whether this part of the family will respect her or not. So she asked you to help her and protect for. If they are opposed to the LGBTQIA+ community they could deny her identity or say very hurtful things. It is still very difficult to be queer in some communities. Basically she just wants to protect herself and as her father that should be your goal as well. So find out what their stands are and let her come out if she wants to.", "YTA. She is NOT asking you to disclose anything about her. She is asking to feel them out so she can decide how to proceed.

It's not that difficult to mention some news article to your brother and discuss how you feel about it. You don't have to be any more specific that that to learn what she wants to know.", "YTA. Your daughter is going to have a hard time out in the world as it is. You say she's old enough to do this on her own, while ignoring that she is also old enough to understand that coming out to your newfound family might cause friction between you and your half sibling. Not to mention the vitriol she might be subjected to if they are intolerant.", "YTA 100x over. Your daughter is asking for the tiniest bit of help in what is most likely the hardest and most traumatic thing in her life up until this point, and you don't want to help?", "YTA: She\u2019s not asking you to come out for her, she\u2019s asking you to figure out if it\u2019s safe for her to come out.", "YTA. Your daughter is asking you to do it because she's trying to shield herself from the pain of finding out they have shitty attitudes toward people like her. Why wouldn't you want to protect her from that as much as you can? She's not asking you to disclose her identity. She's asking you to find out if these new family members are safe people for her to tell. You are her parent. It is definitely your job to protect her and it's sad that you have to come to Reddit to be told that.", "YTA. She didn't ask you to come out to them for her. Just find out their views surrounding it so she can base her involvement accordingly.", "YTA  \n\n\nYour kid asked you for a favor, an EASY one, and you do not want it coming out at your dinner table that they are dirtbags who condemn gay people.   \n\n\nFrankly, its sort of creepy they want to talk about her dating life, or hurting/making someone answer over it. It's penis waving and meaningless, it's not as if they are going to actually do anything so saying that is utter cringe.", "SERIOUSLY? YTA!!!\n\nYou are her FATHER and it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure your daughter feels SAFE in these situations. This is your family and you need to be a buffer in case James\u2019 family isn\u2019t accepting. I honestly can\u2019t believe how you\u2019ve responded. It makes me sick. Do you know how hard it is to come out to not just your parents, but everyone else? Plus this is 3 males and your daughter is clearly uncomfortable around the male gender. Do your job, support your daughter, tell your family and tell your daughter no matter what they say YOU will always love and support her. \n\nIt IS your job to pave the road. That\u2019s what being a parent is about. To make your children feel safe and loved. You managed to make her feel unsafe and unloved simultaneously. Nice work. Why can\u2019t you tell your brother? Are you afraid? It really seems like you are afraid how they might judge YOU not her.", "YTA. Just find out the information from the half-brother and then you can help advise your daughter on how to proceed. This is not hard stuff, this is you having a conversation with your family member.", "YTA - your job as a parent is to protect your child and, respectfully, you\u2019ll be doing a piss poor job if you risk even potentially exposing your gay daughter to homophobia.", "YTA.\n\nComing out is VERY Scary and INTIMIDATING!

I pray you fix this!", "YTA, your daughter is 17. She is a child and she\u2019s looking to you to make sure that your half brother is a safe space for her. What did you do?

You should be equally concerned about whether the people YOU associate with will be shitty to your kid or not. You make kids do \"hard things\" to teach them life lessons and work ethic, and neither of those has ANYTHING to do with this situation! What's the Hard Lesson you want her to learn from this? That some people are homophobic? Guarantee she already knows that. That her parent will choose their estranged sibling over her? Because that's what it sounds like you're setting her up for. Honestly to me it sounds like you're not as accepting of her being gay as you pretend to be. It sounds like you want someone else to make her feel bad about it, since you KNOW you'll be a bad parent if you do it.", "YTA.\n\nNavigating your family in order to protect her isn't the \"hard things\" - it's literally your responsibility as her parent.", "Umm yta. Title is a little bit misleading. Yes, you should make your kids independent and they should be able to do things on their own. But this one is not a regular task. Think of it as a favor and do it for her. She told you years ago so she is not afraid of coming out. She is just concerned how her newly found relatives would react.", "YTA... It sounds like you don't really care about your daughter's safety at all. No wonder your ex-wife divorced you because you don't want to do hard things.\n\nI agree with your ex-wife and daughter.", "YTA \nComing out to one\u2019s family and finding out your relatives\u2019 views on human rights are two very different things. Pushing your daughter to ask your brother and his family if they think people like her should have rights and be treated equally in social situations is potentially putting her in a dangerous situation if the answer is no. Seeing if a place is safe for your daughter to be herself should not just be a tool for evaluating her comfort, but for your own. Would you be comfortable around people who treated you well but simultaneously treated your daughter as an other at best?

She came out years ago, but honestly before she ever said anything to me, she made it clear as a child that she wanted very little to do with boys.\n\nMy half brother James and I reconnected about two years ago. We knew of each other as children, but I didn\u2019t know for sure that he and I shared the same dad. We ended up doing a dna test after our father died and confirmed that we were siblings.\nSo now we\u2019ve gotten to know one another again and we\u2019ve been slowly introducing our families to each other.\n\nHe has two kids that are just a few years younger than my daughter, so Eva was really excited about finally having some cousins closer to her age (the ones on her dad\u2019s side are significantly younger). She\u2019s also excited about getting to know more of my family since I\u2019m not very close with the rest of them.\n\nWe\u2019ve met up a few times and it\u2019s always gone well. Everyone gets along with each other. At dinner a little while ago, James joked that Eva\u2019s \u201cboyfriends\u201d would have to answer to me, her uncle, and her male cousins if they broke her heart. Eva just laughed a little and said that she wasn\u2019t concerned about boys so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that.\n\nLater when they were gone, she asked me if I knew how James and his family felt about the LGBTQ community. I told her that I wasn\u2019t sure because it had never come up, so then she asked me if I could find out for her. I said that she should just talk to them about it directly since she was the one with the question, but then she said that she didn\u2019t want to ask because she didn\u2019t know James as well as I did and it would probably be easier for me to bring it up instead.\n\nI ended up telling her that she can\u2019t expect me to do hard things for her just because she doesn\u2019t want to do them, and if she wants to tell my brother/his family that she\u2019s gay or even find out their opinions on LGBTQ people, then she should do that herself.\nI thought she had let it go, but she\u2019s been giving me the cold shoulder for a bit.\n\nMy ex wife actually called me earlier and told me I was being obtuse about the situation and that I actually should be willing to do this for our daughter.\n\nI feel that Eva disclosing her identity is a responsibility that should fall on her, and it\u2019s not my job to pave that road for her.\nEvidently my ex and Eva both think it is and that I\u2019m being insensitive as well, so I wanted some outside opinions.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

YTA ask him.", "You'd be protecting her by testing the waters with your brother and her cousins.  You should absolutely be willing  and able to see how they feel about it, without 'coming out' *for* your daughter.  Once she knows how they feel about LGBTQ people, then she can choose whether to open up to them or not.  That's all she's asking of you.  But no matter how your brother and her cousins feel, if you really want to protect her, then always be in her corner.  And since you love her and support LGBTQ people, be willing to defend your beliefs if your family doesn't support her or the community.  It's not enough to just not be a bigot, real support means you have to be against bigotry by standing up to bigots.\n\nEdit to add judgment: YTA and I hope you choose to do the right thing now and do better in the future.", "YTA. The world may be unsafe. It may be unfair. However, it is NOT your job as a parent to make your home a replica of the world. Your home should be a safe place, a refuge from the world. Sure, you won't always be there. But you are there now.\n\nAlso, you can find out your brother's stance without outing your daughter. As her parent, it is incredibly importance that you realize there is a huge difference. She is not asking you to tell your brother that she is a lesbian. She's asking you to find out how your brother feels about the LGBTQ+ community as a broad subject, so that she can tell him when she feels like it. If your brother asks why, state a reason that has nothing to do with your daughter's sexuality.", "It's your half brother. You're just not willing to deal with the fallout if he turns out to be bigot. You'd rather subject your daughter to it. Congrats parent of the year.", "I am a straight woman who, for health reasons, had to shave her head. My normal dressing style is casual and my preferred tones are muted grays and greens and blues. In my daily life I was suddenly confronted by microagressions and homophobia. It was quite scary. The way men treated me was turned upside down. I was suddenly treated aggressively, dismissed, and simply disliked for being in the world. I am the exact same person. I wish everyone could have this experience. It was shocking and saddening and I will not forget it until the day I die. Your don't understand what your daughter is going to have to deal with and I hope these AITA responses open your eyes and you start to be a much stronger support for your daughter.", "Well, if he cared he would.", "Then you should be finding out your brothers stance on lgbtq for your daughter.\n\nBecause lgbtq kids are at high risk for emotional and physical assault. There's a high suicide rate amongst them as well \n\n\nI have a story. One of my friends had an older brother, whom was openly gay. He was in his 3rd year of college at WVU when he was jumped by 3 men who beat him to near death, because he was gay. He suffered enough brain damage he never recovered. \n\nProtect your daughter, please.", "Imagine a situation where your daughter comes out to your brother and he yells and berates her. How will you feel knowing you put her in that position when you could have saved her?", "You need to and quickly. There are plenty of people who will want to hurt her because of who she is. What are you going to do if your brother is one of them?", "What other angle even was there to consider?? \n\nShe wasn\u2019t asking you to come out to them. Her entire request was for you, her father, to assess whether it was safe for her to come out (be her authentic self) to these people you brought into her life.\n\nYou should have done this BEFORE you brought them into her life at all. And you didn\u2019t even consider safety as an \u201cangle\u201d, AFTER she had to explicitly request it?? \n\nMy guy\u2026", "YTA. She\u2019s asking you to help keep her safe. She\u2019s asking you to help her not get her heartbroken by people she cares about. She\u2019s not asking to do her homework.

Her life is her life and she should live it in whatever way makes her the most happy.\n\nthis is a really good perspective and i'm glad you have it, but... it unfortunately puts you in a place of a kind of privilege. because that's your daughter, that's your baby who you love and care for and you can't think of someone treating her badly a reason outside of her control.\n\nbut that's something Eva has to think of every time she comes out. it's going to unfortunately be something she has to consider likely for the rest of her life. it's going to be a math she always has to calculate: is living truthfully and regularly worth the harassment and discrimination and potential violence that may happen right now? this is going to apply to a new neighborhood she's walking through, a new workplace she's starting a job at, a new family member that's come out of the woodwork. she's going to have to juggle odds on whether it's safer for her to exist as herself or to stay straight-passing for a while.\n\nshe's asking you to be a parent and help her test the waters before she dives into a potential deep end. is it hard? yes. is it something she's going to have to do on her own the rest of her adult life? yeah. but she isn't an adult yet - she's still your child sussing out your relatives that you brought into her world.\n\nmake sure she's safe and save the life lessons for when it may not actually cost her life.", "It\u2019s concerning that you claim you\u2019ve known she\u2019s gay since childhood but only considered the safety issue now. I hope you\u2019ll be open to listening to the other concerns as well. This is your chance to do right by your daughter.", "I do want to commend you for being willing to reconsider your position now that you are aware. Cis and hetero people generally don't understand that being LGBTQ+ means constantly being on guard to know if things are safe. Genuinely, people are still being killed because of it.\n\nNow that you understand, go forth. And know that her asking you to do it was because she \\*trusts you\\* and \\*knows\\* you're a safe person. Not every queer kid has someone in their life that they trust like that.", "Well you need to start thinking about this from the safety angle my dude, because this is her reality and the reality is, she\u2019s at a higher risk for violence, sexual assault, and other terrible things in life just because of who she loves. Saying this as a gay man in his 40s, who has survived some shit - don\u2019t make it any harder for her than it already will be.", "No, no.

I guess I was thinking of what would happen after that.  Because a choice would have to be made about whether or not she wishes to tell them.  I guess I see it as a multi stage issue.\n\nSo ... OP ... YTA for this part of the process. I think that it's appropriate to support a 17 year old by scoping their attitude.

What a ridiculous comparison.", "I agree that this isn't a good comparison, but it would make perfect sense for her to want to know if her employer is a raging homophobe who may not treat her equally if they find out, not to mention she likely just wouldn't want to work under someone like that in the first place.\n\nOP should still do this for their daughter, IMO. She may not want them to know about her sexuality if it turns out they are homophobic, so OP should be testing the waters in regards to their family's feelings about it.\n\nYTA", "lmao why does the half uncle and his family need to know????", "Who is saying anything about firing? If shes so concerned with what basically a stranger family member thinks of LGBTQ people you really dont think shes not going to be concerned with what a boss and other work people shes going to be around 8+ hours a day with will think of her?

She gonna call OP and ask them to come check with her roommates or work friends if therye cool with gay people? Eva is 17, in 1-2 years shes off to college or at a job, she needs to be able to handle something like this on her own at some point. What better group to do it on then family, yes OP can offer to be there to support etc, but still her hill to climb.", "She literally just wants him to bring up something about lgbtq and see how they react. He should want to know this too because he shouldn\u2019t want to have a relationship with this person if they ended up being the kind to say: \u201cI can fix your child with a 20 gauge!\u201d (Literal comment an LGBTQ mom I know got a few days ago!)", "omg what I live in Motown?!", "I don\u2019t personally believe that it\u2019s my place to tell my brother that she\u2019s gay, but I wouldn\u2019t be upset at him knowing that she is.\n\nI think she should share her identity as she sees fit.", "Coming out to the wrong people has resulted in extreme violence. It's common knowledge. OP doesn't care enough about his own kid's safety to put out feelers and find out if these are safe people. That's bare minimum, and he can't be arsed. Does he even like his kid? I would do this for a stranger, and he can't bother for his own child.", "I'm trans and so is my cousin. She's out but I'm not. My parents are Conservative Christians. You better believe I asked her how they treated her when she and my uncle were over for dinner!", "New fresh college student, knows no body, first couple nights or weeks in dorm by herself who she gonna ask to guage the room?", "I absolutely do not consider the people I work with as second family.", "Why does the half uncle and his family need to know? lmao", "It would make sense! If an employer is a raging homophobe, I'd imagine she'd find out soon enough.

Because they're family.", "right on! why would you ever tell family anything personal about yourself!", "I didn't say anything about firing either. I said discrimination. This stranger family member was literally brought in by op. Op introduced this stranger to his family.

Most people won\u2019t go that far", "No, but her roommates and work friends will not be people that OP introduced into her life, a crucial distinction you seem to be missing.\n\nAnd speaking as a gay man who's lived that life for decades - when I entered college I absolutely still found trusted people I could ask.  When I start a new job, I find trusted people I can ask.  \n\nGoing into these situations blind can be deadly.", "Can you describe such support? Like in this specific situation that OP described, what support can he offer? Maybe feeling his half brothers feelings out?\n\nIf someone decides to spew bigotry at work, school etc, you have a high chance of taking action against that, like suing, complaining to HR, reporting the behaviour. It's in your family  that people act like absolute monsters and morally (not legally) you can't take action most times bc it's family. \n\nSo your point is moot.", "I think he would...if she wasn't almost a legal adult. She's 17, and sooner or later she's going to have to tell people as well.\n\nIt's not like the dad is refusing because he knows the answer, he literally doesn't know as he is reconnecting. \n\nShe should really be opening up to her family about this, but he also needs to be present when she does...there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nTbh I'm annoyed by the reaction to this. This sub often has a problem with parents giving their kids agency. If she were 18 or 19, I guarantee you the reaction would be different.", "This was back in 09  so I don't remember anymore. I was a junior in highschool in VA.

The lack of support I felt contributed to years of mental health issues.", "You absolutely should not tell them she's gay, what she's asking you to do is find a way to find out their stance on gay people.

She can then choose if/when to come out.", "Seriously? \n\nIt\u2019s not about you & she\u2019s not asking you to tell him.

She's asking you to casually bring up the subject of how he feels about it in general. Maybe have him over for a beer and talk about some sports, hunting, or whatever it is you guys talk about. Maybe find a news story about an lbgt issue to see how he reacts. Something like that. She wants to know if he's someone she can come out to not for you to out her.", "JFC what do you think he's doing now? He didn't understand, he does now, and has agreed that he was blind to the danger and is making amends!

Even gone to a wedding or 2 for them and other events.", "Well, so he quits hounding her about boyfriends, for one. And two, the daughter clearly wants to know his feelings, since they are likely to be around each other, and she should feel like she can be herself. Really not hard for OP to take the lead here and start a discussion.", "Yeah, the other person is obviously being a bit ridiculous acting like she's going to call up her parents to find something like that out.

Why does she need to avoid what seems to be the easiest one shes going to get?

OP is fully able to help, but thinks teaching his daughter a \u201clesson\u201d or whatever is more important than her literal safety. he should feel lucky that not only does his daughter trust him enough to ask for help, but he is actually capable of helping her in this situation. instead he\u2019s hemming and hawing about \u201cresponsibility\u201d or what the fuck ever. how about your responsibility to protect your kid??? \n\njesus christ i\u2019m wound up lol.", "i think you need better friends, bitcoinbandit.", "The people I know would.", "I'm a straight woman, and I have served as this person for many friends in the LGBTQ community.
