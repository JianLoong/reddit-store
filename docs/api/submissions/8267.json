She came out years ago, but honestly before she ever said anything to me, she made it clear as a child that she wanted very little to do with boys.\n\nMy half brother James and I reconnected about two years ago. We knew of each other as children, but I didn\u2019t know for sure that he and I shared the same dad. We ended up doing a dna test after our father died and confirmed that we were siblings.\nSo now we\u2019ve gotten to know one another again and we\u2019ve been slowly introducing our families to each other.\n\nHe has two kids that are just a few years younger than my daughter, so Eva was really excited about finally having some cousins closer to her age (the ones on her mom\u2019s side are significantly younger). She\u2019s also excited about getting to know more of my family since I\u2019m not very close with the rest of them.\n\nWe\u2019ve met up a few times and it\u2019s always gone well. Everyone gets along with each other. At dinner a little while ago, James joked that Eva\u2019s \u201cboyfriends\u201d would have to answer to me, her uncle, and her male cousins if they broke her heart. Eva just laughed a little and said that she wasn\u2019t concerned about boys so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that.\n\nLater when they were gone, she asked me if I knew how James and his family felt about the LGBTQ community. I told her that I wasn\u2019t sure because it had never come up, so then she asked me if I could find out for her. I said that she should just talk to them about it directly since she was the one with the question, but then she said that she didn\u2019t want to ask because she didn\u2019t know James as well as I did and it would probably be easier for me to bring it up instead.\n\nI ended up telling her that she can\u2019t expect me to do hard things for her just because she doesn\u2019t want to do them, and if she wants to tell my brother/his family that she\u2019s gay or even find out their opinions on LGBTQ people, then she should do that herself.\nI thought she had let it go, but she\u2019s been giving me the cold shoulder for a bit.\n\nMy ex wife actually called me earlier and told me I was being obtuse about the situation and that I actually should be willing to do this for our daughter.\n\nI feel that Eva disclosing her identity is a responsibility that should fall on her, and it\u2019s not my job to pave that road for her.\nEvidently my ex and Eva both think it is and that I\u2019m being insensitive as well, so I wanted some outside opinions.\n\nEdit:\n\nI love my daughter, and I\u2019m proud of her. Even in wanting her to find out about my brother\u2019s views on her own, I never would have left her to handle that without me at least in the room.\n\nReading the comments, I realize that I wasn\u2019t teaching her how to be independent and do things on her own, I was likely making her feel completely unsupported.\n\nI saw this as a facing her anxieties thing, instead of truly thinking about it as a safety issue. I should have tried to see it from her point of view, I recognize that, and I will do more to learn in the future. I\u2019m going to apologize to her, and ask how she wants to go about this.", "created_utc": 1674678773, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l8whv/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_she_cant_expect/", "score": 4069, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People can completely change in their treatment of a person when they learn they aren't straight. I've seen the nicest people in my own family turn into the most hateful people the moment anything Rainbow comes up. You never know who bigots can be, and they are also capable of being the kindest and loving people to people they aren't hateful towards. \n\nYou're right in that it should be her responsibility to tell them, if she chooses. However, she is asking you as her parent to find out if these are safe people for her to be out to. One of the jobs of a parent is to protect their kids. She wants to know (rightfully so) if she comes out if the reaction is going to be ugly and upsetting or if it will go well. After all, this sounds like a newer familial bond and she may be looking to see if she should invest her time in building a relationship with them. If they turn out to be Westbro Baptist sympathizers, she may not want to invest into the relationship.", "YTA.  This isn't \"hard stuff\" this is making sure they are safe people to come out to.", "It is absolutely your job to protect your daughter. How have you been a parent for 17 years and not realize this? YTA", "Wow, YTA\n\nIt's YOUR half brother and someone you just reconnected with. She's asking you because YOU know him and she doesn't.\n\nQuit being so flippant and pandering.", "YTA. This is not a \u201cyou order your own meal\u201d or \u201cif you want to be good at something, practice\u201d sort of helpful lesson. This is an emotional (and possibly physical) safety issue. She\u2019s going to have plenty of chances to come out to people once she assesses the safety of it. This is a stranger. Help her assess the safety. \n\nAre you the one with a problem telling your brother your daughter is gay?", "Yes, YTA.\n\n\"I won't do the hard things for her\" is sound parenting for stuff like not writing her college essays for her or not waking her up to make sure she goes to her job on time. It's horrible parenting when she is legitimately worried about whether she'd face direct bigotry from people and is asking you, very nicely, as an adult she *should* be able to trust, to scope things out to make sure she can be safe and comfortable around people.\n\nE: Also, surely it isn't difficult for you to ask, right? Even ignoring the exact nature of the favor, if somebody asks you to do something that is very difficult for them and very easy for you, it's pretty rude to not oblige *solely* so they have to do the difficult task. Would you refuse to grab something from the top shelf at a grocery store for somebody in a mobility scooter so they could learn a hard lesson?", "YTA, I can't stress this enough. She is not asking for you to see if she'd be comfortable, she's asking for you to see if she'd be safe. This is something your daughter is right to be scared of. Bigotry is not kiddie shit, and it can bring a deep ugliness and cruelty out of people who you never thought were capable of such a thing. Scoping out the situation for her is not the same as holding your kid's hand because she's scared of going to the dentist. You are making sure she's safe. In refusing to do this for her, you are communicating to her that her safety is not your concern. That her safety is an inconvenience to you. She will remember that for the rest of her life. \n\nIf you want to genuinely support your daughter, do this for her. Keep doing this for her. Don't hold it above her head, ever. It may sound like a stupid hassle for you, but you need to understand that every time she outs herself, she's sticking her neck out. She can get hurt, physically and psychologically and financially. One day, she will. Protect her while you still can.", "Damn dude, YTA. She's still just a kid and she doesn't want to get outright rejected. You don't know what it's like to say you're gay and have someone go off the deep end telling you how you're a mistake and going straight to hell. People get killed or beaten over the fact they are part of the LGBTQ+ community. All she's asking is for you to feel out the situation before she comes out to them. God forbid you try to make her anxiety less just because she's 17. Support your kid.", "YTA \nSo disclosing her identity is her thing. She can decides to whom she wants to \u2018out\u2019 herself. \nHowever, that is not, what she asked you to do. She asked you to check out whether this part of the family will respect her or not. So she asked you to help her and protect for. If they are opposed to the LGBTQIA+ community they could deny her identity or say very hurtful things. It is still very difficult to be queer in some communities. Basically she just wants to protect herself and as her father that should be your goal as well. So find out what their stands are and let her come out if she wants to.", "YTA. She is NOT asking you to disclose anything about her. She is asking to feel them out so she can decide how to proceed.

It's not that difficult to mention some news article to your brother and discuss how you feel about it. You don't have to be any more specific that that to learn what she wants to know.", "YTA. Your daughter is going to have a hard time out in the world as it is. You say she's old enough to do this on her own, while ignoring that she is also old enough to understand that coming out to your newfound family might cause friction between you and your half sibling. Not to mention the vitriol she might be subjected to if they are intolerant.", "YTA 100x over. Your daughter is asking for the tiniest bit of help in what is most likely the hardest and most traumatic thing in her life up until this point, and you don't want to help?", "YTA: She\u2019s not asking you to come out for her, she\u2019s asking you to figure out if it\u2019s safe for her to come out.", "YTA. Your daughter is asking you to do it because she's trying to shield herself from the pain of finding out they have shitty attitudes toward people like her. Why wouldn't you want to protect her from that as much as you can? She's not asking you to disclose her identity. She's asking you to find out if these new family members are safe people for her to tell. You are her parent. It is definitely your job to protect her and it's sad that you have to come to Reddit to be told that.", "YTA. She didn't ask you to come out to them for her. Just find out their views surrounding it so she can base her involvement accordingly.", "YTA  \n\n\nYour kid asked you for a favor, an EASY one, and you do not want it coming out at your dinner table that they are dirtbags who condemn gay people.   \n\n\nFrankly, its sort of creepy they want to talk about her dating life, or hurting/making someone answer over it. It's penis waving and meaningless, it's not as if they are going to actually do anything so saying that is utter cringe.", "SERIOUSLY? YTA!!!\n\nYou are her FATHER and it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure your daughter feels SAFE in these situations. This is your family and you need to be a buffer in case James\u2019 family isn\u2019t accepting. I honestly can\u2019t believe how you\u2019ve responded. It makes me sick. Do you know how hard it is to come out to not just your parents, but everyone else? Plus this is 3 males and your daughter is clearly uncomfortable around the male gender. Do your job, support your daughter, tell your family and tell your daughter no matter what they say YOU will always love and support her. \n\nIt IS your job to pave the road. That\u2019s what being a parent is about. To make your children feel safe and loved. You managed to make her feel unsafe and unloved simultaneously. Nice work. Why can\u2019t you tell your brother? Are you afraid? It really seems like you are afraid how they might judge YOU not her.", "YTA. Just find out the information from the half-brother and then you can help advise your daughter on how to proceed. This is not hard stuff, this is you having a conversation with your family member.", "YTA - your job as a parent is to protect your child and, respectfully, you\u2019ll be doing a piss poor job if you risk even potentially exposing your gay daughter to homophobia.", "YTA.\n\nComing out is VERY Scary and INTIMIDATING!

I pray you fix this!", "YTA, your daughter is 17. She is a child and she\u2019s looking to you to make sure that your half brother is a safe space for her. What did you do?

You should be equally concerned about whether the people YOU associate with will be shitty to your kid or not. You make kids do \"hard things\" to teach them life lessons and work ethic, and neither of those has ANYTHING to do with this situation! What's the Hard Lesson you want her to learn from this? That some people are homophobic? Guarantee she already knows that. That her parent will choose their estranged sibling over her? Because that's what it sounds like you're setting her up for. Honestly to me it sounds like you're not as accepting of her being gay as you pretend to be. It sounds like you want someone else to make her feel bad about it, since you KNOW you'll be a bad parent if you do it.", "YTA.\n\nNavigating your family in order to protect her isn't the \"hard things\" - it's literally your responsibility as her parent.", "Umm yta. Title is a little bit misleading. Yes, you should make your kids independent and they should be able to do things on their own. But this one is not a regular task. Think of it as a favor and do it for her. She told you years ago so she is not afraid of coming out. She is just concerned how her newly found relatives would react.", "YTA... It sounds like you don't really care about your daughter's safety at all. No wonder your ex-wife divorced you because you don't want to do hard things.\n\nI agree with your ex-wife and daughter.", "YTA \nComing out to one\u2019s family and finding out your relatives\u2019 views on human rights are two very different things. Pushing your daughter to ask your brother and his family if they think people like her should have rights and be treated equally in social situations is potentially putting her in a dangerous situation if the answer is no. Seeing if a place is safe for your daughter to be herself should not just be a tool for evaluating her comfort, but for your own. Would you be comfortable around people who treated you well but simultaneously treated your daughter as an other at best?

She came out years ago, but honestly before she ever said anything to me, she made it clear as a child that she wanted very little to do with boys.\n\nMy half brother James and I reconnected about two years ago. We knew of each other as children, but I didn\u2019t know for sure that he and I shared the same dad. We ended up doing a dna test after our father died and confirmed that we were siblings.\nSo now we\u2019ve gotten to know one another again and we\u2019ve been slowly introducing our families to each other.\n\nHe has two kids that are just a few years younger than my daughter, so Eva was really excited about finally having some cousins closer to her age (the ones on her dad\u2019s side are significantly younger). She\u2019s also excited about getting to know more of my family since I\u2019m not very close with the rest of them.\n\nWe\u2019ve met up a few times and it\u2019s always gone well. Everyone gets along with each other. At dinner a little while ago, James joked that Eva\u2019s \u201cboyfriends\u201d would have to answer to me, her uncle, and her male cousins if they broke her heart. Eva just laughed a little and said that she wasn\u2019t concerned about boys so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that.\n\nLater when they were gone, she asked me if I knew how James and his family felt about the LGBTQ community. I told her that I wasn\u2019t sure because it had never come up, so then she asked me if I could find out for her. I said that she should just talk to them about it directly since she was the one with the question, but then she said that she didn\u2019t want to ask because she didn\u2019t know James as well as I did and it would probably be easier for me to bring it up instead.\n\nI ended up telling her that she can\u2019t expect me to do hard things for her just because she doesn\u2019t want to do them, and if she wants to tell my brother/his family that she\u2019s gay or even find out their opinions on LGBTQ people, then she should do that herself.\nI thought she had let it go, but she\u2019s been giving me the cold shoulder for a bit.\n\nMy ex wife actually called me earlier and told me I was being obtuse about the situation and that I actually should be willing to do this for our daughter.\n\nI feel that Eva disclosing her identity is a responsibility that should fall on her, and it\u2019s not my job to pave that road for her.\nEvidently my ex and Eva both think it is and that I\u2019m being insensitive as well, so I wanted some outside opinions.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I see you\u2019re recognizing that queer folks face some safety hazards when they consider coming out to new people. I\u2019m going to take a moment to clarify that your daughter has already been assessing her safety with your brother\u2019s family.\n\nWhen your brother made his crack assuming that your daughter would date boys and her male relatives would be responsible for intimidating the boys, he revealed something important about himself without realizing it. He told your daughter that he holds deeply entrenched assumptions that girls date boys and girls need the men in their lives to manage their relationships. \n\nThese ideas are *heteronormative*, *heterosexist*, and *misogynistic*. That means \n\n\u2014they assume that heterosexuality is the standard from which other sexualities deviate\n\n\u2014they find heterosexuality preferable (more comfortable to be around, more comprehensible)\n\n\u2014they regard women as having inferior ability to make decisions about themselves and their relationships, or make their needs known to their partners (infantilizing)\n\nPeople who harbour those ideas are often not safe or supportive company for queers, especially young queers. Most of us have had the experience of coming out to the wrong people, and our communities are full of true stories. Once your daughter took that in, she had every reason to wonder how your brother and his relations would think of her and treat her\u2014and you. She has to weigh whether she\u2019s willing to be out to these folks. She actually has to wonder if these lovely new cousins who have been raised by this guy will turn on her, expose her to social problems, or even physically harm her. She also has to weigh whether she\u2019s comfortable potentially blowing up your relationships with them, and what kind of emotional repercussions will arise within your family.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot for a kid to navigate, especially when you, her dad, have some important emotional stakes in the situation as well.\n\nSo yeah, apologize and step up. Don\u2019t out her, but have a conversation with your bro about what you believe about queer folks and our place in society. Listen to his answers, report honestly to your kid, and listen to her while she parses them. And be prepared to reassure her that you\u2019ll choose her if necessary.\n\nBest of luck from a queer cis parent of queer nonbinary teens", "YTA. You're the person who's been introducing this man and his family to your daughter and encouraging this connection. If they are homophobic, it's your responsibility to find out and do something about it, this relationship is yours too. This isn't a \"her\" problem, it's your problem too.\n\nIf you're not even willing to look into it, how is she supposed to know that she won't have to deal with the consequences alone if they are homophobic? Will you keep bringing them around? You're saying that regardless of the outcome, it's her problem and not yours. And that's just not right.", "YTA. \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t know if this person wants to literally k*ll gay people.

I couldn\u2019t come out to my aunt or grandma - they\u2019re too religious for me to be able to. My other aunts could likely care less, one of them probably knows and that\u2019s fine with me. It\u2019s more or less protecting your kid so they don\u2019t get hurt trying to get close to someone that doesn\u2019t think they should exist for being LGBT. I\u2019m 20, and my mom still does this. Why? Because protection is important. Because without it, your daughter could truly end up hurt - emotionally, mentally, physically. Being gay in a world that isn\u2019t very accepting is hard. \n\nHave a talk with your brother. Listen to everyone here, it\u2019ll save her so much anxiety. And fear.

A lot of anxiety and fall out (even if it happens) can be managed.\n\nThere is also a need to explain to your daughter that people have different beliefs and sometimes don't automatically support you. It takes work and patience and not dismissal.\n\nThey might have questions, some of which may be uncomfortable and she can respectfully decline to answer those.\n\nRead the room and give her all the love and support she needs.\n\nIt is also worth thinking that independence is not purely facing every situation alone, it is also our job as parents to equip them to handle and respond to the independence and what comes along with it.\n\nHope it goes well...", "Good edit", "It seems like you've maybe already realized this from your edit but just to add another voice to the chorus: our lives are in very real danger to this day.
