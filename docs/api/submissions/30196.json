In public and such its how I have to do it because nowhere has wheelchair accessible changing tables. I've never had an accident and its all very well contained. I did this all with my first so I'm pretty good at it lol.\n\nI changed him and tied the dirty diaper in a bag, hung it on my chair and waited for my husband to return.\n\nWell, my MIL walked in, saw the diaper sack and connected the dots.

I told her it was necessary because her house isn't accessible, she responded by saying I could have asked her to do it upstairs or waited. A dirty diaper has never killed anyone.\n\nI told her neither were options - we don't allow others to change diapers, which she knows, and I was not going to make him wait.\n\nShe disposed of the diaper and when my husband came back called me a disgrace, asked him to teach me about hygiene. It was tense and I felt extremely uncomfortable. \n\nMy husband is on my side, mostly, but did say it was a little gross and I could have at least tried to calm him down first and see if he'd be okay to wait.\n\nI disagree - I wouldn't enjoy sitting in a dirty diaper, I'm sure he doesn't either. \n\nIts all quite uncomfortable but hopefully will calm down soon.

Out of all the options here, you chose the best one. Let's look at the consequences:\n\n1. You wait and make your kid suffer needlessly.\n2. You strain and possibly hurt yourself to take the kid up to the bathroom.\n3. You annoy your MIL.\n\nI could be wrong, but her annoyance is the lesser of three evils here.", "There's a disgrace here, but it's on MIL thinking it's fine to leave a kid in a shitty diaper.\n\nNTA", "Non-accessible house is a good excuse for you to not visit this MIL\u2019s house!  She should be proud that you are able to manage on your own.. she doesn\u2019t sound so nice", "INFO: Why won\u2019t you let another family member change a diaper? This seems odd. Are you always with your children? You don\u2019t ever get a babysitter?", "No, you are NTA. Kids poop and mess diapers, and no it cannot wait half an hour.   \n\n\nOh, and no, you should not have to lug yourself up stairs just for a natural thing like that. It's not like you tossed him onto the dining room table or kitchen counter. MIL needs to chill, or to accept that family visits will be severely limited for a long time. Hubby needs to be a touch more on your side, though you said he was supportive to a point.   \n\n\nAs someone who lived in a chair for several years you have my respect. Go, Mom, Go!", "NAH. It\u2019s gross and I would also be grossed out, but making him sit in a dirty diaper until someone else got back wouldn\u2019t have been fair to him. I\u2019m sure asking your MIL to do it also wouldn\u2019t have gone over well if she\u2019s willing to call you a disgrace for anything.", "I'm actually going to go with NAH.\n\nYou did what you had to for the good of your kid. Your MIL's house is not accessible, and that sucks, but making a house accessible is not easy and not cheap. You did the best with a bad situation. \n\nHowever, you changed a diaper in a public space at a food function. I can see why she freaked out, and I think a lot of people would have done so--hopefully not externally, but probably at least internally.", "NTA But today, I learned that there are no accessible changing tables, and that is super depressing.\nI dont have kids, so I never even thought about it.", "NTA, you're in a wheelchair, she didn't set up a change station, and otherwise the baby will get nappy rash.", "I\u2019d ask MIL to change the baby since there\u2019s no accessible bathroom available on that floor. I\u2019m not understanding the \u201cno one changes baby\u2019s diaper but dad, baby sitter and me.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s no way to wash your hands after you\u2019ve changed your kid and I can\u2019t tell if you moved into a private area.\n\nYTA", "ESH for lack of flexibility. I\u2019ll start with OP. Always ask the host where they would like you to do diaper changes. A good host would then set up an accessible area for you to change diapers. Changing a poo diaper at a food function is not nice.\n\nMIL sucks for not offering you an accessible place to change diapers to begin with. If a person in a wheelchair comes to my place, I would ask them what accommodations I should make before they show up. Calling you a disgrace is awful, too.", "ESH\n\nEach of you has kind of a ridiculous position here - she won't allow diaper changes in shared areas of her house and you won't allow anybody else, not even the grandma, to change your kid's diapers. Her house her rules against your kids your rules. \n\nYou both kinda suck. I'm on the fence about Dad, who's caught in between the two of you. Poor guy.", "NTA for changing the kids diaper. Super weird to not let anyone else change your child. Like you say it\u2019s a boundary, but you might want to talk to someone why you feel the NEED to have this boundary.", "You lost me at nobody else can change a diaper. Are you purposely trying to alienate you mil.", "I would have asked my MIL to change the diaper.   \n\nyta", "YTA.  When your child needs changed and you are in someone else's house, you ask where they want you to do that.  Has your MIL harmed another child while changing their diaper?  I have children and I find it very entitled to do a diaper change just where ever.", "Nta.\n\n\nSo it's ok to make a baby wait ty be changed. Having a dirty diaper that can cause a rather or even burns? All because she can't deal with reality of LIFE?\n\nI would tell hubby that's fine because of that now you and kids will not be going over there anymore since it's so disgusting. That you k ow you are unwelcome, and you will not be letting her say this and disrespect you and to do so in front of the kids. So he can have fun but since he agrees he has no leg to stand on to fight you on this because he can't guarantee ot won't happen again. He can guarantee that she will keep her mouth shut and you refuse to make baby uncomfortable because she an adult can't deal.", "YTA, while changing the child was important, you could have explored other options. Your child's waste shouldn't be exposed publicly in a house that is not your own. \n\nYou just didn't want to discomfort yourself but alas you must sometimes to respect other people's homes.", "NTA, it sounds like you physically couldn't go anywhere and limited every other option for yourself. It is very gross but there was nothing you could do.", "I never worried about annoying the mil", "NTA...\n\nAnyone else visualizing the pearl clutching as MIL was acting all indignant?\n\nOP, you are a good Mom.  You saw your baby's distress and discomfort and you remedied the situation.\n\nBravo to you!", "Given that the Broad Street cholera outbreak started from an infant\u2019s dirty diapers being washed into a cesspool that leaked into the nearby water well, a dirty diaper had totally killed someone. That being said, ESH. MIL for inaccessibility, and you for not allowing anyone else to change a diaper and potentially contaminating a public space (especially if food is being served in the same area).", "NTA", "I would ask did you do it out of sight of others or in the middle of the living room?  If you were trying to be discreet then definitely NTA.  It sounds like your MIL would find something to complain about with you however no matter what.", "WTF did I just read? How dare this woman. NTA and I hope she treats you better OP.", "NTA does your rule about not letting others do diaper changes annoy her? If so I wonder if that\u2019s part of her freak out. I really don\u2019t see the big deal. It\u2019s not like you used her kitchen table.", "Remind your husband and your MIL that MIL isn\u2019t getting any younger\u2026 How would she feel if she was in an aged care facility, and the staff let her sit in a soiled nappy? How would she feel if they told her, at that point,  \u201cA dirty nappy never killed anyone\u201d?\n\nWell done for making good use of the resources you had.\n\nNTA", "NTA.", "NTA. Regardless of her opinion about it she overreacted and is just mean af. Your husband should be 100% on your side.", "You're NTA.

I change kids on floors and couches, car seats or chairs with a diaper pad under them. Your lap is fine. \n\nOlmy place I won't change a diaper is on a table or in the restaurant, or a bathroom with no changing station. Those places are just gross. \n\nYour MIL is an AH though.

Yikes.", "NTA.\n\nYour MIL is TA. Truly, she is *awful*. \n\nYour husband is also TA. He needs to back you up. His behavior in this was really out of line.", "Most definitely NTA.

Off in the corner of the living room, sure. \n\nNot letting others change a diaper is out there, but ok.
