Like toddlers are just nudists but also have no idea of \"consent\" they literally just don't give a damn about clothing.", "It does matter a little bit - full diapers do smell, and at an event where people are eating it might have been obvious to the MIL without seeing the diaper bag that one had been changed just from the lingering smell.", "The OP and partner have their reasons for not trusting. They aren\u2019t shared, but to have that kind of boundary that includes extended family says so much. It takes a village of trusted people. MIL is not one of them.\n\nI agree dads are statistically more likely to be a danger. But for this specific instance both parents are in agreement, MIL is not trusted.\n\nI can see your point that if it weren\u2019t for this boundary, then there wouldn\u2019t have not been an issue.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t agree with is that the boundary is unreasonable or needs to be defended by the OP.\n\nThere were two reasons she had to change her baby on her lap, one is the boundary, the other is because she didn\u2019t have a safe accessible place to do so herself.\n\nWhy is it that the boundary is what needs to give, and be defended, and not the lack of a safe accessible place? If the bathroom is the only place acceptable to MIL, I\u2019m assuming this based on her request. Then maybe it\u2019s the MIL that is the one being unreasonable. Based on her reaction and how she chose to handle this? I\u2019m going with the MIL.", "So your hands WERE on/around their genitals. It\u2019s not weird to say that unless you make it weird but yeah dude changing diapers means being up close and personal and it\u2019s definitely more invasive than just catching a glimpse of a mom changing a diaper.", "I agree I wouldn\u2019t in my kitchen either if there were other options.\n\nBut what other options were there? And I\u2019m not in a wheelchair which adds so much more to the difficulty of this.\n\nA toxic AF MIL? No thanks. I mean regardless I wouldn\u2019t let some who is that much of a dick change my kids diaper. It simply requires too much trust. It\u2019s not that the MIL didn\u2019t have a right to be offended or upset. It\u2019s how she handled it that I have a huge problem with.", "Obviously i am not talking about a child that is still in diapers. I was replying to the person who doesnt seem to understand the difference between a bathroom vs other space. Yes a bathroom is a shared space too but a) usually you are behind a closed door where other people cant see you b) it is meant for human waste. The hallway on the other hand is not meant for human waste and does not have a door so anyone can waltz on by without warning. \n\nYou know It's actually interesting that OP doesnt want other people changing their child yet has no problem exposing their child out in the open...", "Lol. Boom, got em.", "Wow, you think people who are disabled should just stay home and hide away from family and society. OP not being able to go upstairs because of discomfort and pain is bad behaviour? Great way to lose an argument buddy \ud83d\udc4d\n\nEdit: downvote away! I\u2019m not an ableist. I don\u2019t think OP handled the situation perfectly, but I do not agree that she should have to put herself through pain and danger of walking upstairs holding a baby, just cause her MIL got a little annoyed. And I DEFINITELY do not agree with people not being accommodating to disabilities, and saying that disabled people can\u2019t participate in society because of their impairments.", "It looks like that was only after she edited her inital comment.\n\nEdit: and now two hours later, she deleted her comment that she had previously edited. But left the rest of her arguing. What a peach!", "She edited. Her original sentence was, \"You become a bit weary of not just anyone but everyone.\" That's it, that was the entire sentence.", "That is your sentence. If you can't change it so you can use a synonym, it's not the right word. You used the wrong word and you're throwing a tantrum now because you were corrected.\n\nYou've gone from a simple mistake to outright wanting to be wrong. Lucky you're proud of that, I guess. If you \"said what you meant\", than you're either saying you deliberately misuse words or you're just admitting you don't know the difference. But you do you.\n\nAlso I'm a woman. Not a sir. But thanks for the misgendering!", "Nah, don\u2019t put this on women. This is a YOU issue, not something normal women think about. I\u2019m not worried about \u201cbeing preyed upon\u201d, I\u2019m not hyper vigilant, nor was I worried that my children were going to be preyed upon, especially not by my in laws. That\u2019s abnormal to worry that much, and if you truly think that way, I hope you\u2019re seeing some type of therapist.", "That\u2019s incorrect. You\u2019re confusing leery with leer. Leery and wary are direct synonyms as the poster above stated. A predator leers at someone. As a woman I am leery (or wary) of predators.", "Nah, I'm a parent, and this just sounds completely wacky to me.", "So if your child is 17 with a boyfriend/girlfriend, you think you have more say over whether your child shares their naked body than they do themselves?\n\nI don't think you quite have this \"ownership of their own body\" thing down.", "Why that age?   I know that the age they legally become adults.  But why does that actually make them capable of understanding the ramifications?  And would you think that\u2019s a universal age, no matter where a child is growing up in the world?   For example, legal age of \u201cconsent\u201d is different in different places.  Do you mostly set you age based on *legal* capability or on more emotional capability?", ">Why is it that the boundary is what needs to give, and be defended, and not the lack of a safe accessible place? If the bathroom is the only place acceptable to MIL, I\u2019m assuming this based on her request. Then maybe it\u2019s the MIL that is the one being unreasonable.\n\nWell like I said, I think they both kinda suck in this situation, so I'm not just harping on mom.  MIL sucks for her terrible reaction and cruel words. If my MIL did that, I don't think we'd be going to see them for quite a while. I can't entirely fault her for not having multiple diaper changing areas though. It's not like they still have young kids living there. I certainly don't expect mine or my wife's parents' houses to be as set up for kids as ours is. \n\nBut you have to admit that some of this falls on OP. All she had to do was ask for help. I don't know about you, but if I was hosting a BBQ with friends and family and one of them just decided they felt comfortable enough to change a *poopy* diaper right in the middle of a shared space without even attempting to find a better solution or ask for help, I'd be pretty embarrassed and miffed too. It's frankly unreasonable to think you will under no circumstances ever in your life have to compromise a boundary like this. So yes, I think in a social setting like this, she should have bent. Honestly, the more I think about it, the worse it seems. \n\nLook, I'm a SAHP to two young children. Parenting is fucking hard so I don't tend to pass judgment on how others raise their kids or what they have to do to get by. But I can't help but feel that raising your children to think the world is just so incredibly dangerous that you can't trust anyone but your parents, including grandma and grandpa, is just objectively bad.  Not only does the data show we're living in the safest time in human history, but it just seems this will do nothing but lead to some antisocial and sheltered behavior later in childhood. Honestly, it seems like it's more of a control issue than anything else.\n\nYou said grandparents are just people who had kids who had kids, and don't automatically deserve the benefit of the doubt, right? Well, the same principle applies to OP. Just because she has kids doesn't mean every decision she makes is the right one or undeserving of scrutiny.", "Yeah, it\u2019s only weird if you make it weird, and saying, \u201cNo one touches my child\u2019s genitals but me,\u201d makes it super weird.", "Asking.\n\nAll she had to do was ASK MIL\u2019s preferences or help within her boundaries and go from there\n\nIf MIL is that horrible she shouldn\u2019t be there.  She\u2019s an adult who went to someone else\u2019s home.  Be adult enough to ask.\n\nMIL\u2019s house, she absolutely has the right to boundaries around her house", ">You know It's actually interesting that OP doesnt want other people changing their child yet has no problem exposing their child out in the open...\n\nI don't think that is interesting at all. There is a big difference between having access to privates, and seeing a baby's butt for a second.", "I just assumed you were a sir, because you didn\u2019t it read it - and just started mansplaining. I \u201ccorrected\u201d it just for you.", "No. No it doesn\u2019t. Babies cannot clean themselves. They have needs that are taken care of by what is commonly referred to as a \u201cprimary caregiver\u201d. This includes parents, yes but can also include other people. If you are not a primary caregiver of a child you should not be touching their genitals. Period. \n\nAnd having an entitlement and obsession over changing a child that isn\u2019t yours is super fucking weird."]}
