Expect this sort of thing when you make that choice in the future.", "ESH", "[deleted]", "YTA, she didn't ask you for advice. Sounds like you had the issue and made it her issue too. Maybe she didn't want to hangout and used her husband as an excuse? Mind your own business unless they ask for the advice.", "NTA. you're her friend, and sometimes you have to say these things. Don't harp on it, but do speak your peace once (which you did) and support her.", "NTA\n\nWell, her husband definitely acts like the fourth child.  \n\nOf course he got real upset.  If your friend chooses to divorce her husband, which I would agree with 1000%, suddenly he has to be an actual adult, living by himself.  And he has to pay child support.\n\nYou know it's real bad when a grown man literally has to have the same punishments as their kids.", "NTA\n\nOP, please forward this to your friend:\n\n[Why does he do that?

He doesn\u2019t seem to respect her or her time, your friend should stick up for herself so she can honour her commitments to others, and she also should not be putting you in potentially harmful situations like that phone call with her husband. \n\nCurrently, you are definitely inserting yourself into their relationship. It\u2019s okay to want to do this if you feel like it\u2019s necessary to help your friend, but based on your actions it seems like you\u2019re doing it blindly, which could add to the tension of not only their relationship, but yours with your friend. If you want to help, you should look into reputable resources for helping friends who are in dysfunctional relationships, and helping friends get out of dysfunctional relationships.\n\nIf you\u2019re not willing to do this, and feel like you can\u2019t participate in these discussions without reacting this way, you may want to set some boundaries with your friend. It\u2019s much easier to stay out of a relationship when someone stops pulling you into it.", "ESH. I know how annoying it is to be constantly hearing your friend complain about their spouse, but you can **not** tell them to divorce their spouse. You should have just taken some distance from the friend so that they stop trauma dumping on you. Your reaction is normal after having so much trauma dumped on you, but I would personally not say it to a friend.", "Yes YTA. I think you really care for your friend and you had good intentions but it crossed the line when you gave \u201cadvice\u201d she never asked for. I think it\u2019s different if she said she was considering it and wanted your opinion, but you asserted yourself. The level of anger feels like maybe you\u2019re projecting some of your issues onto her husband. I agree he doesn\u2019t sound great but the only person who should be this mad is his wife.", "YTA, and you're a bad friend. She needs support NOW and you're not giving it to her.", "YTA.  She is the problem, not him.  She had a choice, stay home or see you and she made it.  Her telling him what you said shows that she will stick by him no matter what.  You also need to realize that you are not her priority anymore, her husband and kids are.  This is also a MYOB.  You can support her if you want or not support her.", "YTA and way to make your friend's life harder.", "YTA but only because of how you handled it. It's okay to tell your friend when you're worried about them, even to say you think separation might be wise, but you have to handle it a lot more delicately than that. You've likely made her life with this man and your friendship much more difficult for the foreseeable future.", "YTA - Every marriage is not the same. Some things might seem off to you, but it might work for them. Short of him being abusive, you should never ever get involved in someone else's marriage. Of course he called you and screamed at you.", "NTA. You got fed up at how you saw she was being treated. So you spoke up about it. Nothing wrong with that. I liked your sign off line too!\n\nBut, there are always consequences, so one has to think carefully before you tell a friend something like this. A lot of people don't like having their partners criticized, even if they agree with the criticism. And you may lose a friend that way. \n\nIt's also not clear what your friend thought of your advice; \"she said she'd think about it\" could be a polite brush-off. Maybe it wasn't, but it's hard to tell from this description.", "Everytime I've given this advice I've gotten some type of backlash.

But, I will tell you what I've told every single one of my friends, a person will not leave a relationship until they are \"done.\" \n\n\"Done\" looks different for everyone, and is intensely personal for the person considering leaving. You'll/they'll know it when it happens, but not a moment sooner. To be New-Age-y, there are karmic ties we all have with each other, and people remain in our lives until they have served their purpose for our lives. He sounds like a major AH and I have no doubt she fantasizes about leaving him all the time, but she won't, until she is Done. So just support her as best you can, don't judge her, and tell him what an AH he is every time you see him.", "YTA for calling her and just telling her to leave him.", "NTA. \n\nNormally, with advice being thrown around like \"get a divorce\", I'd be calling you out on that, and even if this is borderline \"everyone sucks\" territory, this dude doesn't need a wife, he needs a mom.", "NTA \n\nAt a certain point, it\u2019s being a good friend to tell the truth, even if it means losing the friendship.", "It's so easy to tell someone they need to leave or get a divorce, but what are her economic realities? There are 3 children to think of, besides herself. Yes, he's TA, but if she doesn't make enough to support herself and the children (because you know he cannot be counted on to pay child support), then she's kind of stuck with him. You've had your say, she told him, he called you out. There's nothing else you can do, except let your friend know you will support her, or whatever, should she decide to leave him. NTA.", "YTA mind your own business and worry about your own marriage (if you have one).\n\nYou didn't tell her to divorce him because you worry about her, you told her to divorce him because you're annoyed at him. So get off your high horse pretending you're worried about care so much.\n\nIt does sound like he's (the husband) an AH and needs to step up his effort in the house, but to tell her to outright divorce him is way out of line.", "You're probably right.

They want to dump on you and you know, ok, sometimes that's what friends are for.  If you don't want to listen, that's fine too.  \n\nBut it always just bites you in the ass.  And the advice goes unheeded.  And then they're back pissing in your ear. \n\nTake the ear piss if you choose to.

We don't know what was said in the hours long call, but telling a friend \"you should leave them\" is far from meddling in someone's marriage. \n\nAlso funny how is completely okay for the husband to call OP and insult them but them talking to their friend about her shitty relationship is AH behavior.", "My ex didn't like my friends encouraging me to leave him, but they were right and I needed to hear it. If OP's friend's husband doesn't want people telling her to divorce him he should get it together and act like an adult partner.\n\nETA OP is NTA", "I might be hurt if someone told my partner to leave me but I wouldn\u2019t call them screaming.  \n\nHe can hurt, angry, confused \u2026 but calling a partner\u2019s friend to scream at them? Not emotionally mature behaviour.", "Leave them is advice to a problem, very valid advice at that. \n\nMy best friend absolutely told me I should leave my husband when he was depressed and spent months taking his depressive anger out on me and refusing to get help. I did tell him I was leaving him, he finally got the help he needed to address his depression, which in turn finally convinced him to go to couple's therapy like I originally asked when we were constantly in conflict, and within 6 months I had an even better partner than the dude I originally married. \n\nNow that he's better, he recognizes what a problem he was and how unfairly he treated me, and he agrees that it was the reasonable conclusion anyone would have to the level of mistreatment I received. He's still friendly with her and respects her when she comes around because he's an adult who can admit when he does something wrong and doesn't blame other people for the consequences of his own behavior.", "It is advice and considering the context it\u2019s good advice.", "NTA.\n\nI doubt it's the first time you've advised your friend to get a divorce.\n\nYour friend won't leave her husband, especially if she has enabled him. She'll continue moaning about him to you and others. It sounds like you're fed up of being her sounding board.\n\nI'd avoid giving advice from now on. Stay away from the drama or change the topic if she brings it up.", "OP, NTA\n\nYou lost this friend a while ago tbh.", "ESH. The solution to everything is not divorce. Ending a marriage, especially when children are involved, is a big deal and easier said than done. Offering support to a friend does not require advising her to leave her husband and the father of her children.\nThe friend was confiding in you and you offered her some advice. She should not have shared that private advice with her husband.

I've been in many conversations like this, and most people don't want advice, they just want to voice their frustrations and often hear what they are saying repeated back to them in a different voice.", "Maybe tell your friend that by staying with his toxic spouse, he is teaching his child that this toxicity is normal and ok in a relationship.", "NTA, exactly.  However, you could have said something like 'When you decide to leave him, you will have support from your friends group. Meanwhile, here's a website listing signs of an abusive relationship.  Check it out and see if you fit the description.'\nPlant seeds for her to think about.  She already has some guy telling her what to do.", "NTA. You care about your friend that\u2019s in an abusive relationship. But maybe instead of a divorce, you help her stand up to him. If she had your get together on the calendar for Saturday and he knew about it, then she should leave on Friday to spend time with you guys and leave him with the kids. He\u2019ll have to deal with it. If he doesn\u2019t help around the house she should hire someone that he pays for. She should stop doing things for him.

It's ok to voice concerns but not demand they leave their spouse.", "Thank you!

You can ask things like \"Do you understand he isn't likely to change?\" or \"If this was always what life was like, would you be happy?\" But telling her to leave over the phone is only likely to lead to escalations like this and won't actually get her free of him.", "You should have said, \"You sound upset. Can you put your mommy on the phone?\"", "NTA because you're right, he sounds terrible and she should leave him.  But did she turn around and tell him exactly what you said?  WTF?
