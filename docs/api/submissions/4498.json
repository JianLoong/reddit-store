You are so sensitive\", excluding me from things, and straight up telling the therapist when we did group therapy that she \"hates me\"\n\nMy husband has a shiny spine and we are very low contact, but do still see her since we have mutual family. MIL recently got engaged to someone she went to high school with. Apparently they really really hated each other which isn't too surprising. MIL has admitted she was a mean girl in high school (lol she thinks she is better now)\n\nAnyway someone recently asked them if they were high school sweethearts and MIL was like oh God no we hated each other. Person laughed and MIL said \"no I mean real hate, like he reenacted the pig's blood scene from Carrie) I immidiatley perked up because I need to hear that story. He quickly clarified it was paint and then unfortunately the conversation moved on.\n\nLater I asked her fiance about it. He said it's a funny story but he wasn't going to tell me as he knows how I feel about her and it seems mean. I pointed out that he is the one who did it, and he is literally still smirking while talking about it. He said that he can laugh at her, I can't. Honestly I was just being playful, batting my eyelashes, asking in a cutsey voice and stuff, but he continued to say no and I let it go.\n\nWell imagine my shock when I heard through family that he told MIL I was flirting with him. MIL said she wasn't even going to confront me but did tell her sister to show how \"pathetic\" I am and because apparently this is proof that I am the problem. I immidiatley confronted her fiance and he said I was being flirty and it would be weird not to tell her. \n\nI am furious. I feel so betrayed. He clearly made something out of nothing, so I said I would not be alone with him under any circumstances. Well the other day MIL realized I was serious when she went to take something out of the oven and I followed her into the kitchen (hubby was in the bathroom) MIL called me ridiculous and a child.\n\nI also set a boundary that unless he formally apologizes in front of the family I will not be going to the wedding. He is refusing, and i guess I feel a little bad about my husband not going if I don't go, but I have to stick to my boundaries.", "created_utc": 1670790255, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zj74g1/aita_for_refusing_to_be_alone_with_mils_fiance/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
