You are so sensitive\", excluding me from things, and straight up telling the therapist when we did group therapy that she \"hates me\"\n\nMy husband has a shiny spine and we are very low contact, but do still see her since we have mutual family. MIL recently got engaged to someone she went to high school with. Apparently they really really hated each other which isn't too surprising. MIL has admitted she was a mean girl in high school (lol she thinks she is better now)\n\nAnyway someone recently asked them if they were high school sweethearts and MIL was like oh God no we hated each other. Person laughed and MIL said \"no I mean real hate, like he reenacted the pig's blood scene from Carrie) I immidiatley perked up because I need to hear that story. He quickly clarified it was paint and then unfortunately the conversation moved on.\n\nLater I asked her fiance about it. He said it's a funny story but he wasn't going to tell me as he knows how I feel about her and it seems mean. I pointed out that he is the one who did it, and he is literally still smirking while talking about it. He said that he can laugh at her, I can't. Honestly I was just being playful, batting my eyelashes, asking in a cutsey voice and stuff, but he continued to say no and I let it go.\n\nWell imagine my shock when I heard through family that he told MIL I was flirting with him. MIL said she wasn't even going to confront me but did tell her sister to show how \"pathetic\" I am and because apparently this is proof that I am the problem. I immidiatley confronted her fiance and he said I was being flirty and it would be weird not to tell her. \n\nI am furious. I feel so betrayed. He clearly made something out of nothing, so I said I would not be alone with him under any circumstances. Well the other day MIL realized I was serious when she went to take something out of the oven and I followed her into the kitchen (hubby was in the bathroom) MIL called me ridiculous and a child.\n\nI also set a boundary that unless he formally apologizes in front of the family I will not be going to the wedding. He is refusing, and i guess I feel a little bad about my husband not going if I don't go, but I have to stick to my boundaries.", "created_utc": 1670790255, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zj74g1/aita_for_refusing_to_be_alone_with_mils_fiance/", "score": 900, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you don\u2019t want to go because he won\u2019t apologize then be a grown up and encourage your husband to go to his Moms weeding, remember she will always be his mom and no need to try to make him picks sides.", "YOU DID FLIRT!!\n\nYou threw aware your dignity to get dirt on your MIL. Somehow I'm now doubting your narrative about how evil the MIL is when you straight up went to her fiance and flirted with him.\n\nYou felt \"betrayed\"?? That this man wasn't taken with your charms? Hope your husband realizes that you like to CREATE drama too, and learns that you were flirting with other men. \n\nYTA", "ESH- I'd say get out of each others lives but then your toxicity would spread to innocent bystanders so please go away and enjoy your self made personal hells and leave the rest of the world out of it", "Lol. This is why we drink our water, eat our vegetables, and mind our business. Messed around and ended up with your name in someone\u2019s mouth. \n\nIf your MIL hates you, I\u2019m so sorry, but it\u2019s a her problem. You cannot control how people feel about you, but you control how you act around them and treat them. If you\u2019re giving her fodder, stop going around her. If she\u2019s naturally an unkind person, stop going around her. Your husband might have a shiny spine, but there\u2019s no reason to keep utilizing it. Focus on yourself and your husband and call it a day.", "I hope your husband goes to the wedding by himself while you \u201cstick to your boundaries\u201d.  YTA", "YTA. You were being flirty. He didn\u2019t lie. Stop acting innocent. This is completely on you. \n\nGrow up.", "Jeepers you all sound exhausting. I'm sure your MIL is difficult but sounds like you give as good as you get. ESH. Except your husband as far as I can tell.", "Ummmm, news flash - you were flirting with him. YTA. Grow up.", "So you flirted with him and now you\u2019re mad that he told people you flirted? YTA", "YTA, the MIL might suck but that doesn't mean you don't need to look in the mirror...", "YTA, you flirted with him, no one took anything out of context and yeah flirting with others can damage your marriage. Maybe think about that before you try to flirt with men to get your way. Grow up, and quit demanding people apologize for your actions.", "NTA, i don\u2019t think you were trying to get with this fianc\u00e9.", "I'm surprised you hang out with them. NTA", "YTA, it certainly sounds like you were flirting with him, in order to get dirt on and be possibly cruel to your MIL. He didn't lie, maybe exaggerated but you need to own your own behavior in that interaction.", "YTA- yep, that is commonly known as flirting.", "YTA!\n\nYou wanted dirt and juicy gossip on your horrible MIL and it backfired. Batting your eyelashes and using a cutesy voice *IS FLIRTING*! MIL is marrying someone who is just as low and awful as she is. The whole thing is one big pissing contest and it's pathetic.", "YTA because you WERE flirting with him by batting your eyelashes and asking (repeatedly) in a cutesy voice. And big surprise, he chose to share that with his fianc\u00e9e so as to keep everything out in the open and above board. You should have dropped the whole thing the first time he said no. You chose to pester him and FLIRT with him as a way to get the dirt on MIL so you would have ammunition to hold against her in the future. He was right not to tell you. You\u2019re just mad cuz you got burned and he wouldn\u2019t dish. Get over yourself. Sounds like MIL has at least some legitimate foundation to her feelings for you.", "NTA", "NTA but definitely not the best decision maker. If a situation is as hostile as it is with your in-laws, better to remove yourself from such a situation entirely and not engage with people who most assuredly are not on your side because that's how you get fucked over. I'm sorry for the harsh words but we all learn our lessons this way. You play shitty games, you win shitty prizes.", "YTA what you described was flirting. Leave that lady and her fianc\u00e9 alone.", "YTA\n\nThis story is literally in your perspective and you legit said 'batting my eyelashes, asking in a cutesey way'...the fuck do you think flirting is? All you were missing was biting your lips and twirling your hair. You don't like MIL, fine, but you acted flirtatiously (whether you intended or not, by your own accounts) in order to get information on MIL from her fiance, someone he knows you do not like. Maybe MIL *is* the from hell...but this one if on you.", "Erm yta ma\u2019am , you intentionally WERE flirty to try to get him to tell you then got mad he spoke up abt it .", "\"I was just being playful, batting my eyelashes, asking in a cutesy voice and stuff.\" Yta. Wtf do you think flirting is? If anything you owe him the apology.\n\nS.N. He made it pretty clear he felt uncomfortable telling you the story the fact he had to say no more than once makes you a double a.h.", "NTA.\n\nRefusing to be alone with him seems a reasonable response to what he did.", "But you... were flirting??   \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. You did flirt and hit called on it. \n\nAnd that\u2019s not a \u201cboundary\u201d. You gave your future FiL an *ultimatum*.", "Im in the minority but NTA, men need to realise women being nice or politely descitful ISN'T fLiRtInG.

Everyone else needs to grow tf up.", "Why do you even bother going around her at all?  i would be NC. Your husband can go see her if he wants but I would be done with her.  You both hate each other. NTA for not wanting to be around fiancee but YTA for trying to dig dirt on your MIL. I guess that means ESH except for your husband.", "RIGHT?! Like I'm not saying OP is evil or something, but wow was she dumb. Flirting with MIL's fianc\u00e9 when she knows MIL hates her...all because she wanted some juicy details about how fianc\u00e9 was mean to MIL...likely to make herself feel better. Like OP, I get sticking with your boundaries. But like - you were flirting with him, so like don't pretend you weren't.", "And if OP's husband is LC, why is OP in a posoyof being alone with the husband and why were they going to the wedding??", "I bat my eyelashes at my father when I want something. That\u2019s not automatically flirty.", "Pretty sure MIL isn't a much better person.", "guys stop downvoting my comment i agree she's the AH I'm just self reflecting :(((((( I'm so bad at interpreting social clues sorry", "OP wasn't wrongly accused of flirting, OP was called out for inappropriate flirting with her MIL's boyfriend.", "I am wondering what op\u2019s definition of flirting is. Does she think she has to grab his crotch or something?\n\nOp, yes, YTA. Sounds like you are the mean girl.", "> Yeah...and newsflash for OP. That is flirting.\n\nThis is why guys don't make first moves anymore until it's almost in writing.... She flirted/sexualized the situation just for the story... Playing him\n\nYTA", "Flirting or coquetry is a social and sexual behavior involving spoken or written communication, as well as body language, by one person to another, either to suggest interest in a deeper relationship with the other person, or if done playfully, for amusement.\n\nDo you really believe she was trying to sexual with the guy?", "I'm conflicted. Because while even from OP's own story it does sound flirtatious, OP may have genuinely NOT been \"trying\" to flirt. \n\nI know people, men and women, who do those kind of actions when they are 100% not intentionally flirting with the person they are speaking to. Hell, my stepmom's husband and his sister do it to each other, and she and I do it to each other. I do not wanna hook up with my... umm... aunt-in-law? in-law? \n\nOkay I get that she's not actually kin to me but she acts like an aunt and I buy her gifts that I address to \"Aunt HerName\" so between her being old enough to be my mom and a pseudo relative, I'm definitely not flirting when I bat my eyes at her and talk cute to get her to tell me a funny story about something her brother did. (In my case I wanna hear the embarrassing stories not as \"ammo\" but because he was a real wild child and did some hilarious stuff. He rode a dairy cow through a drive through because he wanted a burger but the drive through wouldn't let him walk through and he didn't want to drive drunk. So he walked the cow to the fast food place, then rode it through the drive through. Its funnier when she tells it though.)\n\nMy brother has done stuff like that for as long as I have known him if you refuse to tell him something \"harmless\" (aka not a deep, traumatic secret but like, what you got him for his birthday or what you plan to get someone else for Christmas) he wants to know. He's definitely not flirting with everyone he has done it to.\n\nIf a person who behaves like this naturally and innocently meets someone who can only see it as flirting, then they are likely to be misread. And I know if someone accused me of flirting and caused drama with someone I hate when I was not doing any such thing (or at least wasn't -trying- to do any such thing) I would not be alone with them either.\n\nI think this might be a ESH? But I'm not certain because as I said, maybe OP WAS flirting?\n\nSo I'm gonna hold top level comment judgement on this one. I just wanted to speak up for the innocent \"flirts\" like my family. (Also, is it irony that I am really BAD at recognizing whether someone is flirting with me and when I WANT to flirt I have no idea how to do so? There's a guy I see when I work and I think he might be into me but he might also be polite and fuck me sideways I do NOT know how to figure out which it is...)", "Yeah and that exaggerated mannerism with the hands, I don't know what to call it, like reaching for his arm like \"oooh dooo telllll daddyyyyy\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShudder.", "I thought the same thing. I don\u2019t hang out with people I don\u2019t like\u2026but that\u2019s just me. OP\u2019s husband can visit his mom on his own.", ">He feels uncomfortable as he wouldn't have anyone to talk to.\n\nHis family will be there... you know, the reason why y'all supposedly still have contact cause of mutual family?", "She thought she could use her feminine wiles to coax the story out of him and get some good dirt on MILs humiliation but it backfired. FFIL sounds like a good man. You deserve what you got. You\u2019re not owed an apology.", "> Being nice to men apparently is also considered as flirting.\n\nSometimes friendly behaviour is mistaken for flirting, but that's not really relevant to the issue because OP clearly wasn't just being friendly.", "She did try to play him, but what you're referring to is guys being afraid of sexual harassment accusations. That's not what's going on here, OP didn't falsely accuse him of harassment, she actually harassed *him*.", "Have I used big eyes and a little girl voice to get something out of my mom? Yes. No, I wasn't flirting with my mom, but I was using the fact she would fail for the adorable act......sometimes. But using those tactics on a man you barely know? OP knew she was flirting.", "She didn\u2019t invite anyone he talks to. She only invited her sister and BIL who are very much on her side with how she treats me", "Yah that's what I do lol", "Never gets old.", "It's a loaded statement. Told in its entirety casts OP as manipulative (which is what she was being) whereas left in ambiguity positions her as wanton or destructive.", "Lol really!?!  Is my sister flirting with our dad when she goes \u201cdaddy will you PLEASE refill my wine\u201d social context is key.", "That's insane. Do they have mommy issues and a woman had never paid any attention to them before? It's as if women are a new specie that they've never interacted with before, and they misinterpret most of our intentions.", "Right it's like no bro she just works at Starbucks she is forced to be nice to you and ask your name.", "Wdym?", "And this isn't OPs dad? There's no pre-existing relationship where being cutesy and wheedling negates the flirt aspect. You're right, social context **can be** key. \n\nAnd just to clarify: I'm a flirty person. I acknowledge that if I'm interacting with another human being in a social setting, there's about an 85% chance it's going to read as over famikiarity or flirting (unless i make a concious effort not to, anyway). I don't then get to argue that nooo, I wasn't *flirting* because there wasn't sexual undertones! I get to *explain* that it's casual and not flirting with intent, but that's it. I don't get to deny it.\n\nAnd OP 100% *describes stereotypical flirting* as what she did. Cutesy, eye batting, etc etc.", "I guess I\u2019m just failing to see \u201cflirting\u201d with an obvious non sexual partner as the same as flirting with someone single.  I\u2019m not flirting with my 12 yo cousins when I say they\u2019re pretty.", "You keep using family examples. \n\nThis is not OPs dad or cousin or even long term friend/unofficial uncle. To lay out the degree of separation, it is her husband's estranged mother's fiance, that they only interact with occasionally. \n\nTurning on the flirty behavior is notable. He could have either said she was flirting, or being a manipulative AH. Honestly, saying she was flirting was the more tactful option.", "I guess I\u2019m saying \u201cflirting\u201d wasn\u2019t the more tactful option when they accuse someone at the family holiday party for the first time of it.  That\u2019s actually pretty much my whole point.  They knew they were twisting the truth to get the biggest reaction just like OP when she was fishing for a story.", "I mean it in the way OP implies her MIL hates her and treats her badly.", "You sound really invested in the drama of it all. Not sure what else to tell you. If you really think his pain is worse than what you suffer from his mother, then we're back to the \"shut up and take it\" plan since you won't entertain actually making your life better. \n\nShow up to her wedding in a white dress and bring her old high school frenemies?

OP flirted with MIL's fiance, so that part is true based on the story. The issue I have is that I think the fiance and MIL are both implying OP flirted in a sexual manner as to break apart their relationship, which it does not sound like OP did. There are many ways to flirt, many meanings to flirting, and in this case the lines were probably blurred when fiance told MIL OP was flirting. Everyone in this story sounds like someone I would personally just steer clear of. No interest in this youthful drama. Maturity just is not present in this family.", "YTA OP not for the playful \"tell me all you know\" antics but when he told you **\"NO\"**, you should have left it alone.  NO means NO and you know this.  And YTA because you actively tried to get info that was humiliating to your MIL and you would have relished this.  The proof is in your own words of your perking up.
