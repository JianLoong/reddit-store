If it's to be seen as a commentary on boundaries, then if anything it's about how it's useless emotional labor to maintain constant vigilance around your boundaries when dealing with people you knew perfectly well and who have never encroached on them in the first place. The property line is the boundary and it exists regardless and both men respect it. The *fence* is a labor intensive barrier that the neighbor insists on maintaining even though it changes nothing between the neighbors. And every year it breaks down as nature passes through it and the labor is done all over again to patch it back up. All for nothing.\n\nYes, boundaries are great and healthy. But often with healthy relationships it is enough to have them known, and consequently respected. Like the property line. Why build barriers to enforce them when you have no material need to do so? By choosing to maintaining the fence each year, you show that you do not trust that the neighbor will respect the boundary, despite having nothing but evidence to the contrary.\n\nGood neighbors are good neighbors, regardless.
