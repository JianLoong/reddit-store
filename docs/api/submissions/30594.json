Where else would my 14 year old son make out with his girlfriend when I'm home?", "I've got a different way of thinking, the person who wants the fence should put it up and maintain it. I've got dogs, my rear neighbor doesn't. I built my fence on the property line, pretty side out, after a survey and permit, and I pay all the maintenance costs. It's only fair. I'm the one that wanted/needed the fence, I'm the one benefitting from it, they shouldn't have to bear the burden. My neighbors managed to not get offended. They still say hi, chat, bring me vegetables from their garden and I give them composted manure for their beds. It is possible to build a fence and be friends with your neighbors. Hell I even tore down and disposed of the sagging fence put up by previous owners of their property (after asking permission and getting their blessing). Gasp! They thanked me! All it took was a little communication. I'm glad they weren't assholes about it. A nice fence can benefit everyone. They hung gutters on their side of my fence to grow strawberries in, they've been wanting to do that for a while but didn't have a good fence to do it on. I'm really looking forward to some fresh strawberries next year. They're cool neighbors and we get along great, I know they'll share.", "Well here's the thing about 'sharing'. Most US ordinances essentially require the 'pretty side out'. So if you do a picket or privacy stockade fence, the board or pickets must face the neighbor or public. So if you share a fence do you have to put boards or pickets on both sides of the stringers? GC laborer. Can't make this crap up", "Yep.  Here it is 3ft.   So it is about a mower length.\n\nSo they aren't walking in my yard.  I personally wouldn't care if they did.  And we frequently just cut the back  neighbors little strip.    \n\nBut also the set back is why we don't have a fence.  We have a small yard.  Plus fences cost money we didn't want to spend.\n\nI would never pay for a fence If it was on the property line and the neighbor wanted it they would have to pay for it.  It isn't something I want to spend money on.", "Fences don't create boundaries, they enforce them. The property line is the boundary, and if both parties already respect it, there is no function for the Fence, it does nothing. Helps nothing. It's a pointless yearly chore to maintain and the narrator does so solely out of a neighborly sentiment even though it's utterly pointless, thereby even further showing that there is no value in the fence.\n\nThis poem isn't about how boundaries are good. If it's to be seen as a commentary on boundaries, then if anything it's about how it's useless emotional labor to maintain constant vigilance around your boundaries when dealing with people you knew perfectly well and who have never encroached on them in the first place. The property line is the boundary and it exists regardless and both men respect it. The *fence* is a labor intensive barrier that the neighbor insists on maintaining even though it changes nothing between the neighbors. And every year it breaks down as nature passes through it and the labor is done all over again to patch it back up. All for nothing.\n\nYes, boundaries are great and healthy. But often with healthy relationships it is enough to have them known, and consequently respected. Like the property line. Why build barriers to enforce them when you have no material need to do so? By choosing to maintaining the fence each year, you show that you do not trust that the neighbor will respect the boundary, despite having nothing but evidence to the contrary.\n\nGood neighbors are good neighbors, regardless.

I don't understand the thought process that would put me in such a hypothetical situation, to me its just common sense to contain your animals and not allow them to disturb neighbors. Yeah I know there are people who do let their animals roam but I think people like that are assholes, irresponsible animal owners and in general just tend to be complete fucking morons.
