Well, he decided that he didn\u2019t want to take a day off from work; there were a lot of things that went wrong surrounding our wedding, from having three months to find a new venue, to the cake not being ready, but I did my best to just roll with everything and not be a bridezilla. My sister showed up to the cabin the day before the wedding and kept my husband and I up until 1 am the night before the ceremony; she wouldn\u2019t take the hint that we were trying to go to sleep, and we were exhausted from last minute wedding preparations.\n\nEveryone has their limits, and while I dearly love my nephews, they can be a bit much; my older nephew, we\u2019ll call him K, said a lot of offensive and frankly disturbing things to my friends when I or my sister wasn\u2019t within earshot. His brother, we\u2019ll call him E, told my new mother-in-law to F off (he said the actual word) when she politely told him to stop messing with her dog; worse still, he tried messing with an ax at the cabin during the reception that we had rented for the week to have our honeymoon. I told him that he couldn\u2019t mess with it, and he said, \u201cYes, I can!\u201d I said, \u201cNo, there are too many people nearby, and this isn\u2019t ours,\u201d he said, \u201cYes, it is!\u201d I said, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t belong to us; we rented this place for the wedding, and we\u2019re responsible for any damages.\u201d \n\nI tried to be understanding because they live on a farm, and he\u2019s probably allowed to chop wood at home and at his grandparents\u2019, but this wasn\u2019t the time or place to be swinging around a tool. My husband was getting frustrated, too, and I finally told my sister that E had to go home because he wasn\u2019t behaving; I said that my niece and other nephew could stay, but E was out of control. She got upset with me and is still holding a grudge over three years later. She\u2019s civil towards me, but I have heard from others that she is still bitter about me kicking her out of the reception; we don\u2019t talk as much as we used to either.\n\nI felt terrible at the time, and I still feel guilty for telling her that E had to go; I didn\u2019t say that they all had to go, and her husband could have picked him up since he was the one who decided not to come to help her, they\u2019re his kids, too. E has always had boundary issues, and some more serious behavioral problems that my sister can\u2019t seem to see; K was really upset because he wanted to camp, but I don\u2019t think that he knew that he wasn\u2019t going to be camping outside our one bedroom cabin on our wedding night (awkward). \n\nAm I the asshole for kicking my nephew out of my reception?", "created_utc": 1697827287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cia5o/aita_for_kicking_my_sisters_kid_out_of_my_wedding/", "score": 436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This post is all over the place.", "And you're mourning the loss of her friendship *why?*", "Oh wow! Misread that.\n\nOkaaaay a six year old with an axe is definite no!!!", "oh my god good catch \ud83d\udc40 #toozoot4reddit", "We have a nephew who's like that right now. He's younger though, and we haven't seen him in two years\u2014we'll be hosting him along with the rest of extended family soon, so we're hoping he has grown out of it, but his parents don't discipline, they just look the other way. Oddly though, when they aren't present, he is fine, because then the other adults feel free to step in and discipline him (nothing harsh, just firm) and he responds really well.  But only IF they aren't there.", "I've never understood this. My SIL has 2 girls that are 8 and 10 years younger than my oldest son. When they were younger they used to treat him like a jungle gym. He hated it. So right after he told me this the next time they came over sure enough they're all over him. She actually got mad at me for telling them to stop. I told her if she would parent and entertain her children maybe my son and I wouldn't have to.

She wanted to be single for a night instead of being a parent. It sounds like she\u2019s blaming you for her husband\u2019s lack of help. It seems like E and her don\u2019t like when people set boundaries. Instead of rocking the boat at home, she\u2019s blaming you.", "Why would you allow your 16 year old nephew to stay after you said: \u201cmy older nephew, we\u2019ll call him K, said a lot of offensive and frankly disturbing things to my friends when I or my sister wasn\u2019t within earshot.\u201d?  That makes zero sense.\n\nYour sister is self-absorbed as is her spouse and they are raising sociopaths. Who cares if she keeps her distance? Your life will be all the better for the less time you spend around them.\n\nThe only things you should have done differently was tell her to take all of her kids home bc her sons were not behaving and she was making a fool of herself.   Also you cannot blame her for the fact you have no backbone. You and your husband staying up until 1am was because you didn\u2019t say: \u201cWe are exhausted and going to bed now.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026she wouldn\u2019t take the hint that we were trying to go to sleep,\u2026\u201d stop hinting! \n\n You approached your sister the same way she handles her kids: you didn\u2019t.\n\nNTA just be grateful for the low contact.", "NTA.  It sounded like K needed to go, too, if he was going to be that crude and rude.\n\nAlso, next time someone's keeping you up and not taking hints, just be politely blunt:  \"Well, we've got to get to bed.  Thanks for stopping by, see you tomorrow!\"  And hold the door open for them.", "NTA. Your sister's grudge is not your fault. You are not responsible for her emotions. The child wasn't being safe or behaving appropriately and the mom wouldn't do anything about it.  So, logical next step is he needs to go home.", "NTA. Knowing the word \u201cF off\u201d at the age of six definitely reflects bad parenting, he would have got kicked out for other things.", "NTA. If that child seriously hurt someone, it could have ruined the whole wedding, it's one of the most important memory for you and your husband , you don't want to be remembering someone getting seriously injured with an axe by your nephew!

According to the story the older nephew is K. It was E who told the MIL to eff off, and it was E messing with the axe. E is 6. Who the hell allows a 6yo to play with an axe? Who the hell lets their 6yo wander around a wedding venue unsupervised, to begin with?\n\nYou\u2019re right that the OP is NTA, though. Her sister is nuts.", "They know they have problems.

I would rather not lose anymore family.", "I need to borrow this sometimes", "You can substitute a super soaker for the spray bottle. Might be more acceptable and definitely more fun. Lol", "ROFL I will take that under advisement.", "Right, and that happens a lot with kids; they know who they can push boundaries with and who won\u2019t budge. I don\u2019t know if they still do, but my sister and her husband used to spank him; it just seemed to make him even more defiant and angry. I think that\u2019s part of why I want to remain a part of their lives; I worry about the kind of person he will become in that environment without someone to advocate for him.", "Yeah, when he was literally scratching my husband\u2019s legs, all I did was tell him to stop and say, \u201cBoundaries, E.\u201d She said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what boundaries are, he\u2019s only 7!\u201d Well, that\u2019s the problem; my kids know that they should ask someone before hugging them because I\u2019m teaching them consent and bodily autonomy.", "She wasn\u2019t always like this; I used to live at her house when I first moved to PA from MI, and I have noticed over the past 4-5 years, her whole family has changed. Her husband travels a lot for work, so I don\u2019t know if that has anything to do with it; their relationship is much more tense than it used to be.", "I hate to agree with you, but that seems to be the consensus here; I know that my kids aren\u2019t perfect, and I have had to leave the store without finishing my shopping due to their behavior, but I didn\u2019t get offended over it.", "I don\u2019t know how she disciplines him now, but I know that she used to spank him; I think that made him more angry and defiant.", "As long as I can put tuna water in it.", "No children are perfect. You have to create some boundaries while still letting them be their own person. Unlike you, your sister has not done this, and this may become a bigger issue.", "Lmao!", "Spoken like someone with siblings."]}
