Well, he decided that he didn\u2019t want to take a day off from work; there were a lot of things that went wrong surrounding our wedding, from having three months to find a new venue, to the cake not being ready, but I did my best to just roll with everything and not be a bridezilla. My sister showed up to the cabin the day before the wedding and kept my husband and I up until 1 am the night before the ceremony; she wouldn\u2019t take the hint that we were trying to go to sleep, and we were exhausted from last minute wedding preparations.\n\nEveryone has their limits, and while I dearly love my nephews, they can be a bit much; my older nephew, we\u2019ll call him K, said a lot of offensive and frankly disturbing things to my friends when I or my sister wasn\u2019t within earshot. His brother, we\u2019ll call him E, told my new mother-in-law to F off (he said the actual word) when she politely told him to stop messing with her dog; worse still, he tried messing with an ax at the cabin during the reception that we had rented for the week to have our honeymoon. I told him that he couldn\u2019t mess with it, and he said, \u201cYes, I can!\u201d I said, \u201cNo, there are too many people nearby, and this isn\u2019t ours,\u201d he said, \u201cYes, it is!\u201d I said, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t belong to us; we rented this place for the wedding, and we\u2019re responsible for any damages.\u201d \n\nI tried to be understanding because they live on a farm, and he\u2019s probably allowed to chop wood at home and at his grandparents\u2019, but this wasn\u2019t the time or place to be swinging around a tool. My husband was getting frustrated, too, and I finally told my sister that E had to go home because he wasn\u2019t behaving; I said that my niece and other nephew could stay, but E was out of control. She got upset with me and is still holding a grudge over three years later. She\u2019s civil towards me, but I have heard from others that she is still bitter about me kicking her out of the reception; we don\u2019t talk as much as we used to either.\n\nI felt terrible at the time, and I still feel guilty for telling her that E had to go; I didn\u2019t say that they all had to go, and her husband could have picked him up since he was the one who decided not to come to help her, they\u2019re his kids, too. E has always had boundary issues, and some more serious behavioral problems that my sister can\u2019t seem to see; K was really upset because he wanted to camp, but I don\u2019t think that he knew that he wasn\u2019t going to be camping outside our one bedroom cabin on our wedding night (awkward). \n\nAm I the asshole for kicking my nephew out of my reception?", "created_utc": 1697827287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cia5o/aita_for_kicking_my_sisters_kid_out_of_my_wedding/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
