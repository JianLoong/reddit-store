I wonder if they are trying to shame you for setting boundaries with them, and that\u2019s why you posted this. You have the perfect right not to help them if you don\u2019t want.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult - you can make your own decisions. So rather than think of it as AITA, for your own well-being just think about how to handle this in a healthy way.\n\nIt's okay to be angry with them about the way they treated you. But living in anger is not healthy for you. And anger isn't the best state of mind for making decisions or for communicating. So in a time when you are calm and away from them, think about how you would like to ideally handle this - in a way that you politely refuse to do anything you don't want to do for whatever reason, that you don't need their agreement or permission, and that you can let them have whatever drama they want without letting them draw you into participating.\n\nHang in there!

It\u2019s normal to have a little fun at someone\u2019s expense when they are learning something but what you\u2019re describing sounds like verbal abuse.

From you referring to your dad as \"my old man\" to your description of everyone belittling everyone else in your family, the problems stem from a basic lack of proper communication and respect for one another.  \n\nThat being said, I suspect you have great potential!  Rise above and beyond and search out other people in the world who can become role models and teachers for you to follow.  My son lost his dad when he was 6, and his dad was one of those guys who excelled in everything, pretty much.  Building, woodworking, athletics, etc.  So, I do understand what you are going through, from a unique vantage point.  All I can say is there ARE teachers out in the world, whether you find them in peers, positions of teaching, artists, authors, musicians, etc.  Learn their stories, grow from their lessons and experience, and let yourself follow any dream you aspire towards.  Refuse to let those in your family decide your projection in the world.  Becoming awesome, all in your own right, is the best way put those who failed to support you, into their proper place.", "NTA\n\nI hope you will find a way to talk through this with them for your own benefit. Not everyone can teach what they know. Not an excuse for them, but it does happen. My hub had to work really hard to find things he could \u201cteach\u201d the younger son because they had little in common.", "NTA. \n\nIf they\u2019re going to be pricklier than thorns on a rose bush, that\u2019s their problem. They can\u2019t ask for help while being rude to you.", "NTA. They had the chance to help you and they pushed you aside instead. Probably told you to toughen up plenty of times too. Well, wish granted. Tell them to do it themselves. It\u2019s not hard, so they can figure it out.", "Would be so satisfying to go elsewhere and learn at least one of those sets of trade skills.  Then, one  day blow them away with what you can do and then refuse to help.", "Yeah that's more or less how it goes. I'm 35. So dno if it's a age thing or whatever. And I did not like it. I'm fucking great at fixing cars now though.", "I've heard lots of guys say they had the same experiences. It's like these dads forgot that they didn't know how to do this stuff at some point either. But I reckon their parents were probably kinder, better teachers. Why do they want your help now? According to them you're not any good at it.\n\nNTA. Have a beer and relax. And if they say anything, tell them you don't want to mess up like they say you always do.", "NTA The not teaching you is one thing and somewhat common. The belittling is the problem, and a real asshole move. I wouldn't even turn on a light switch much less hold a flashlight. Course I also wouldn't be around them either.", "NTA. You know if you did help they\u2019d go straight back to telling you you\u2019re doing it wrong!", "are all boomer fathers like this?  even my brothers are like this.  if they weren't complete jackasses i feel like i may actually have learned or could learn from them", ">NTA.

If someone\u2019s a jackass like that, they don\u2019t deserve a flashlight holder. I\u2019d just snap \n\nim ok with being the butt of the joke and ribbing.  but i actually want to learn.  its always frustrated sighs, swearing that im a dumbass and insults and personal attacks when i cant do something handy.  it sucks cuz now i suck at handystuff and fixing anything because of the PTSD of my youth.  I hate to call it PTSD but i really think it is", ">As far as I can see....\n>\n>ESH.  From you referring to your dad as \"my old man\" \n\nthis isn't rude. \"my old man\" or \"the old man\" is a very normal way to casually refer to your father in america. it's not derogatory.", "My dad called my grandfather \"the old man\", and now I call call him the same. He has never seemed bothered by it. As always.. context matters. In my case its interchangeable with \"dad\".", "You couldnt see further than your nose", "good advice, thanks!  \n\nI've been trying youtube and have gotten better with a power drill but really need a mentor haha", "I\u2019m not sure that this is a boomer thing specifically. But there are people in this world who create a sense of security and strength in themselves by putting down others\u2014 particularly their children, since children are so much weaker than they are.", "Naw.. my dad was pretty solid at teaching me things when I was willing to listen.", "[source](https://blog.ohiohealth.com/parenting-trends-generation/#:~:text=The%20Baby%20Boomer%20Generation%20(born,be%20more%20nurturing%20than%20critical.)\n\nNo.\n\n\"The Baby Boomer Generation (born around 1946 up to 1964) struggled with the concept of child discipline, especially traditional discipline techniques from their own childhoods.

I was lucky and learned some things from my dad. But the good news is you can learn a lot from YouTube videos and I\u2019ve done a lot of handy things that way. There\u2019s also little workshops at home improvement stores and local community college classes and that type of thing.  Hopefully you\u2019ve also got a grandparent, aunt or uncle, friend, etc that can be a resource. A lot of people actually like to teach.", "I thought my post was pretty positive.  But, the old man stuff has always sounded like it lacked a certain level of class and respect.  That's my view and I am sticking to it!", "Oh, I do.  Sadly, people like you don't.  I'm sorry that you have no further insight than your tip o' schnoz.", "Also, if you volunteer with Habitat For Humanity, or even for a local community theater where you can help build the set... Either way you'll meet great people and will learn great skills.", "Those home depot workshops are pretty decent.", "I feel this in my soul. My dad was the same way, and if I asked a question he looked at me like I had 3 heads and all of them were cursing my grandma\n\nNTA so hard.\n\nAlso. Weirdly enough. He's the exact opposite with my son. He's the most patient man alive with him. Which I'll always appreciate.\n\nStill treats me like I have 3 heads and gave grandma the cancer that took her though.", "No, my father who is a boomer and I who am also a boomer do woodworking together. We made or refinished over half of the furniture in my house. He also taught me how to do basic work on my car, could get my license without knowing how to change the oil and a tire. \n\nI'm sorry your family was like that so NTA.", "Mine isn't.  He has taught me all kinds of stuff.  Now, at 44 (me) and 72 (him), he's working on handing the family farm over to me and is going over all of his records and such.  He sometimes let's me take an extra tractor out with him and we race.  It's great", "CPTSD is definitely a thing, I recommend looking into it. I completely understand the wanting to learn and being told how stupid you were. I wanted my dad to show me how to change a tire or oil and he'd laugh and tell me I was too stupid to teach - but would show my brothers how to change engine parts. \nPlease take this to heart: anything is do-able, and it always takes longer the first time. You don't suck at fixing things, you just don't know yet. A kiddo who doesn't know 2+2 doesn't suck at math, they just don't know yet. You have to give yourself the patience and love and room for mistakes that your father and brothers never gave you. It hurts to have to reparent yourself, but when our parents fail, we are allowed to work to fix ourselves a little at a time. Treat yourself gently and have patience. You can do it, you are allowed to mess up and try again with zero consequences for a mistake. You are capable of more than your anxiety tells you. \nMy first project was an ikea bedside table - I turned on music, cleared an entire day, and got ice cream. I did a step at a time and whenever I got frustrated I took a break. You can do anything you set your mind to!!", "NTA \"just\" flashlight holding is the most traumatic part for a kid, too.", "NTA \n\nI experienced similar things, kind of.", "NTA Just say you\u2019d really like to help them but unfortunately you can\u2019t because you\u2019re an idiot, you\u2019re ridiculously stupid, you\u2019re (insert swear words/insults) and they need to find someone who was born knowing mechanics to help them.", "No. Not all \u201cboomers\u201d are like that.  That\u2019s a dreadful generalisation, same as calling all \u201cGeneration Z\u201d lazy, and that they don\u2019t work hard enough.\n\nNeither are true.", "No it wasn't. People deserve respect if they respect others. \"Old man\" isn't even insulting in this context. Your reasoning is pathetic.", "My father wasn\u2019t mechanically minded at all, he calls me and asks how to do stuff.  I remember when I was growing up I would just stay away when he was working on whatever project because he would get super frustrated with it anyway.\n\nYears later, I have taught myself how to do most anything I\u2019ve needed to do, from carpentry, to metal working, to working on my own vehicles.  Also my non-blood brothers that I work with are the best and very patient and kind when I\u2019m learning how to do something, so I can\u2019t say that all men are dense and judge mental when it comes to teaching mechanical things.\n\nNTA.  Sorry you didn\u2019t have better teachers!  I find that reactions like theirs are deep seated in their own insecurity.", "Nah, my dad has a 'I'll just do it for you' attitude but it's because he wants to help. (And probably wants to feel needed). If i specifically ask him to teach me something, he'll happily walk me through it. He has NEVER insulted or belittled me for trying to help, or wanting to learn.", "I wonder this myself. My husband is a terrible teacher, and likes to act.. maybe \"big\" is the word im looking for around the grown kids and grand kids. I on the otherhand, am actually quiet good at handywork, and can do anything but electrical, because it scares me. I am also a woodworker. The grandbabies love to help out, and I have a scrap box in my shop, with smaller size tools that they can build their own stuff. Recently my 6 yo grandson made some projects he was able to sell for 20 bucks!!!! But the point is, I guess some men just aren't made to teach people that don't get stuff naturally.", "This!! The license thing..I am female, and had to do the same. Had to change tire, oil, and know all the basics before I could get license. \"If you can't take proper care of a vehicle you have no business operating it\"...Dads words. My kids are now grown, all but one, and they all had the same concept. I can change a tire easily if I have to, but would rather pay someone else to do it now. But, I am very self sufficient."]}
