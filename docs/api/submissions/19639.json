He has no business to bitch about anything to you. He's not the boss. You were doing the task the boss assigned to you. I would've answered him: \"No I couldn't. Can't you see my hands are full?\" I hope the boss put him in his place. It's not up to him to dictate what should be done in his absence.", "NTA\n\nYour role in the job should have clearly written roles and responsibilities. \n\nYou did your job or what you thought your job was and you got told off for it which is just ludicrous. \n\nPossibly a soft AH for calling them a b\\*\\*\\*h as this didn't seem necessary for the situation.", "NTA you did what your boss asked you to do", "YTA. That wasn't a good way to treat a coworker, neither is using leverage with the boss. If you know how to do other tasks I'm betting you get put on those tasks while the other drivers get stuck doing all of the dishes. He was probably just frustrated with that. \nThat's something your boss needs to deal with objectively.", "Esh\n\nSometimes people lose their tempers at work.\n\nYou shouldn't have felt attacked because he isn't your boss--you had been assigned a task to do and were doing it.  It was not the other drivers place to change what you were doing.\n\nHis comment most likely was more frustration that the dishes weren't done instead of an attack on you.\n\nThe right answer was--I am doing what I was assigned to do.  That would be the end.  If he wanted to pout about dishes then it would be on him.\n\nInstead you upped the argument.  That is never--and I repeat--never a good look in a work environment.\n\nI lost my temper at work a couple of weeks ago.  It was out of character.  I went back to the person and apologized for my actions.  It went a long ways and you might want to do the same.", "NTA. The boss asked you to cut dough, so what has the kid to rant about?", "ESH.  You should have just said, \"No, the boss told me to help cut the dough.\"  \"Returning fire\" is not something one should do at work... or really anywhere.", "NAH, I wanna say \"kids today\" and disregard his attitude, but the world has changed. He's still a kid, probably let his mouth get away from him and will regret everything tomorrow. Could you have reacted better? Sure. But no one is perfect. I hope kiddo gets it figured out.", "ESH. That kid should not have treated you that way and you should have handled the situation better. Especially since you were the adult in the room. I get that we get caught up in our moods, especially when we are stressed so I wouldn't dwell too much on the situation or the judgment here.", "I would say NTA, but think the same than you", "Fair assessment to be honest", "As a big fat hairy Sicilian American the heat definitely gets to me.

Yeah it\u2019s a known fact we are lifelong best friends but he doesn\u2019t treat me special when I\u2019m working and even likes to put me in my place in front of everyone else so everyone knows that I\u2019m no different. If anything he makes me do more than everyone else. And I like that too. I don\u2019t want to be that guy.", "I did not call him a bitch, I said if you\u2019re gonna bitch.

This has nothing to do with age", "We usually do dishes between deliveries to help each other out. I do if I see it piling up. Which is a good system. Unfortunately they piled up very fast while I was doing dough and made the sink look even worse", "I\u2019m not petty. In fact I see a lot of myself in that kid to be honest and I would rather him be on my side than against me. I want to clear it up because I feel like I approached it in the wrong way.

So why did you post in this sub?", "No I certainly might\u2019ve been in the wrong here but I had to state my case. I plan on clearing things up regardless next time I see him I would like to pull him aside man to man and settle the beef.
