Don\u2019t tell her \u201cyour family is too healthy,\u201d tell her the truth. \u201cYour family pushes me to do things that are dangerous to my health. Or did you forget that my asthma got triggered to the point that I *passed out?\u201d*", "NTA. What her family does is not healthy - it's disordered eating that has been pushed on the kids since they were little, so your friend probably legit has no idea what normal actually is.", "That's... that's not normal at all. Your poor friend has been so warped by her parents' (or at least mom's) orthorexia that she thinks it's normal when it's actually quite alarming and setting her up for a lifetime of problems including but not limited to a severely dysfunctional relationship with food, physical ailments from malnutrition, and obsession with exercise. \n\nClear NTA. You need to take care of your own health, which means listening to the professionals and making sound choices. You're doing great.", "NTA. I find it weird that her mother chooses what everyone else should eat, and the fact that they eat once a day is insane and generally unhealthy, but hey it's their lives. She also didn't have to take a dig at your family because you told her the truth about why you didn't want to go. It's not okay that you have to put your health at risk because of their way of living. Tell her I said she should go eff herself \ud83d\ude1a.", "NTA. She said what her family does is normal?

What friend and her family do is not healthy or normal, and are disregarding your health needs by forcing their \u201cnormal\u201d ways on you.

Your friend is an ass for not understanding that not everyone views a vacation the same way as her family.", "NTA. What your friends family is doing is unhealthy in itself and it sounds like the entire family now has an eating disorder due to the idiotic parents. \n\nI know plenty of people DO only have one meal a day, and they're generally malnourished.", "nta, your vacay should be fun for you also.  Not going is better than going and letting your misery make them unhappy also.", "NTA sometimes No is enough of an answer.", "NTA", "You pass out from what they're doing so obviously it is neither normal nor healthy to expect you to do it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA for so many reasons. 1) that much exercise and only a salad every day is extremely damaging and unhealthy. \n\n2) picking meals for people is weird. Sounds like the mom is the ringleader of this circus. She has passed her ED to your friend- her immediate defensiveness and turning it around on your family tells me her mom has gotten told multiple times this is in fact the opposite of healthy and has dug her heels in. \n\n3) and this is the one that got to me the most- it\u2019s VACATION! I\u2019m not saying go totally off the rails but isn\u2019t the point of a trip to enjoy yourself, relax, break for your routine and decompress? This compulsion sounds exhausting. \n\nDon\u2019t go, maybe try to talk with your friend under calmer conditions because this is really unhealthy. NTA", "NTA. Their way of eating and exercise is absolutely not normal! That is an eating disorder. Her mum is controlling, and her behaviour is straight up abuse. They need help, that is incredibly worrying.", "NTA and what they do is NOT normal. Even if it was it is against your doctor\u2019s orders and harmful to your health.
