Does that sound like someone who respects boundaries? He made it clear he doesn't want her driving it unless she asks, that's his right because it's his car. She tramples all over that and does what she wants anyway. It's just pure disrespect", "OMG, are you the girlfriend? Imagine thinking you can just take someone's car.", "No, he said she can use it; just ask...it's not that hard. What he is tired of is planning to go out and drive it and it is gone. This sounds like a common occurrence. The GF is claiming the car and is planning to use it whenever she wishes, OP's wants be damned.", "This is a preview though.  What\u2019s yours is ours and what\u2019s ours is mine and i will disregard whatever boundaries you set for these items because they are mine.  It\u2019s just the car for now because it\u2019s shiny.  Give her time and every other shared entity you have will follow.", " Imagine the look on her face when she is tearing up the house looking for those keys. I wonder how she would bring it up when you got home from work.", "Sadly the next time you say yes to her using the car she is likely going to copy the key.  \n\nShe sounds very entitled.", "Just take the car keys to work with you. I'm a female and annoyed for you. I absolutely HATE when I go to use my car and my husband has it. We've had this conversation too and he now asks. If your gf can't respect that simple request, she should be denied access.\n\nAlso, I get that he likes to drive my Audi (not as nice as a corvette but nicer than his Chrysler) but when I want my car, I should have access to it.", "Corvettes and Camaros are my top 2 wish list cars.. \n\nBut hell right now I\u2019d be happy with an accord.", "Hope you're better now.", "Exactly. It\u2019s your car and if you want to drive around your neighborhood blasting show-tunes, that takes precedence over her happy hours or house showing. Take the keys with you and tell her why.", "Are there issues with her car?  Breaking down. Super old. Unreliable?", "If you\u2019ve been living together for a certain amount of time depending on what state you\u2019re in then technically it becomes a common law marriage and assets could be seen as joint.", "I wouldn\u2019t suggest getting married if you can\u2019t even let her use the car without permission, especially when you have another car you can use. I guess NTA since it\u2019s your car but doesn\u2019t sound like a marriage ready relationship. Marriage is a combining of your lives, including cars", "[deleted]", "I've been married 38 years. All our property is marital. I still wouldn't drive my husband's beloved Audi without asking if he minded first. That's just being considerate, IMO.\n\nNTA.", "[deleted]", "Why don\u2019t you read the rest of my comments, and read my post more clearly. I said after multiple occasions, not once, MULTIPLE. Jesus. I said she\u2019s childish, and they need to set boundaries.", "Wouldn't say it's a preview, they've lived together for 7 years, been together total of 10. I'd be curious to know if it's been happening the whole time, and OP just didn't really care about things until now, or whether this is something new.", "I predict a big tantrum is on the horizon!", "my issue is practical. given how frequently it sounds like GF is using the car, she likely isn't covered under OP's insurance anymore if something happens.", "The accord is newer I think it\u2019s a 22 so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a bad car.", "No, its a Corvette. She thinks she looks cute driving it. (Which she might, but not the point).", "No", "Should she really be using the \u201cwell legally\u201d argument with me though? I don\u2019t think my request is unreasonable.", "This is valid ONLY for joined owned assets. If the car is registered only under his name, it\u2019s his. Any assets that each one bring individually into the marriage (or common law marriage is yours), unless you start a nasty legal battle.", "Why does she need to use my car if she has her car she can use?", "My husband and I share everything, but we still have a car that is \"designated\" for each of us. We absolutely do not mind swapping cars, but we always give each other a head's up.  It's not about \"permission\", it's about being considerate in case the other person wanted to use \"their car\" on a certain day.", "What? I would never expect to use my partners car without permission.  Even if we were married.", "Ehh see I don\u2019t like that. I really don\u2019t think I should have to plan out when I wanna use it around when she wants to use it. Like if I\u2019m not using it and don\u2019t plan to that day and she wants to take it than that\u2019s fine.", "He has set up boundaries. She's not respecting them.", "Sorry, after a year of using reddit I'm still have no idea how to read this. Respect to your way of resolving this issue.\n I realised a few days ago that I can't share things. Like childhood issues. So...\n If my gf would start using my car without asking (and reason like going to hospital / vet) I would sell it to her.", "Right. How exactly does that equal an \"EHS\". I fail to see how OP is an AH.", "I agree with this. I think because he's a car guy he's a bit more protective and caring about it.", "True, but I\u2019d even be happy with a pinto too. #needacar \ud83d\ude05", "I know. But there could have been mitigating circumstances. Which i clarified. And have rendered my vote.", "Then NTA. Sounds like shes using your car instead of hers because a corvette screams status symbol and that just sucks. Especially if shes not contributing to upkeep etc.", "Oh I am not defending her. I\u2019m just saying that is probably her logic. Doesn\u2019t make it right though. She\u2019s definitely not being fair to you. You guys need a serious talk. I\u2019m honestly surprised she is able to get to the keys.", "Yes you\u2019re correct. I should have worded it better. My point was more like his gf has a twisted sense of logic with the whole thing and is prolly trying to claim common law marriage rights etc to him", "what does she say when u ask her??", "That\u2019s why I said NTA, but your attitude about mine versus hers isn\u2019t really good for marriage is all. My fianc\u00e9 and I both have \u201cour\u201d cars individually but they are both of our cars because we\u2019re a unit and would never divide up things like that. It\u2019s all good because it\u2019s your car, I\u2019m just saying it seems like an over reaction for someone you say you\u2019d possibly want to marry. Just like how she has her own car, you clearly have a 2nd car you could also take so just seems like an over reaction all around", "Exactly. This is just a common courtesy.\n\nWhen I was 16 I bought my first car, a 2001 Grand Prix. I couldn't even drive it without an adult in the car as I had a permit at the time.\n\nI never once had a problem with my father using my car, not like I could use it on my own anyway. But whenever he used it he ALWAYS asked me. To me, it's just a common courtesy. I've had to use his truck before, and while I don't expect him to say no I'd never even think about taking it without asking first.\n\nNTA on this one. Not everything just becomes shared property just because you are in a relationship. You set boundaries and she doesn't seem to be able to respect them.", "[deleted]", "He is male, of course.", "I only brought out the it\u2019s MY car line after frustration has built up. And also it is factually MY car.", "But OP didn't START with that.  As he has pointed out in comments, he said that after multiple conversations and efforts to resolve the issue.\n\nI've been married 22 years and with my husband 27.  I am the sole wage earner, he is a stay at home dad.  All finances are shared.  We each still have a \"my car\" even though both names are on both titles. Each of us picked out the style/model/options we wanted, and want to have our own available when we want to use it.  I don't take his without asking, and he doesn't take mine without asking.", "This reeks of entitlement. Just because you're in a relationship with someone does not automatically grant you unabridged access to their belongings. That may be how a relationship you would like works but every person has the right to decide how their relationship functions and OP was clear with his. Despite making his boundaries clear, they are still being stepped over so he's not wrong for reiterating that his possession belongs to him.", "I agree. You WBTAH (at least somewhat) if you guys shared everything in your lives and when you bought the car you immediately said \"this is my car don't you dare touch it\" unprompted, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. You wanted to have a reasonable conversation about boundaries and your girlfriend refused to considered your feelings or requests. NTA."]}
