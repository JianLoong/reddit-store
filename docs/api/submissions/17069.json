Depending on the law in your area, if your area has common law marriage and it applies to your relationship, there may also be a disconnect between what you see as \"your property\" and what's community property, but I don't know where you are or what the law is so I won't speculate on that.\n\nThe second, and much more important problem IMO is that she either doesn't respect your boundaries and wishes or has adopted the attitude that you've been together so long that your boundaries and wishes don't really matter.\n\nNext month my wife and I will have been married 14 years. Now, I'm not saying I'm some kind of relationship guru because of that or anything. Lord knows we still have issues we're working on every day. But I've come to understand that, if anything, our boundaries are more important now than they were when our relationship was younger. Now we know pretty well what each other likes, what makes each other happy, and what each other's boundaries are. For one of us to violate the other's boundaries, it would take a conscious, intentional act. That to me is much worse than accidentally breaking a boundary because you're just getting to know the other person. Depending on what the boundary is and how you respond to being told that you've broken it, you can deal with it as part of the learning process. \n\nEither she doesn't feel that way or thinks your boundaries are unimportant or she doesn't know you, what motivates you, and what your boundaries are as well as she needs to. In either case, that's a major problem. \n\nI'm not one to easily jump on the \"DTMFA\" train, but it would not surprise me if your relationship does not survive this issue.

Either an old fashioned Club or something fancy that will cut the engine if its dongle or key fob is not also in the car. She does not get the key, key fob, or dongle. Do this before you have any conversations with her.\n\nSecond, I would tell her the following:\n\n1. That you are glad she likes your car, and you respect her desire to use it and want to honor that as much as you possibly can. (Always start with a positive. Keep bringing up how much you value her and how much you want to continue to allow her to use the car.)\n2. That you are concerned someone will steal your car (look up local theft statistics to back this argument. Because it's true. You're concerned that *she* will steal it, but you don't need to add that part.) You can bring up the *stupid as shit* TikTok challenge where teenagers steal somebody's car and go on a joy ride, because that's a thing now. \n3. That she is *incredibly* lucky you haven't panicked and called the cops, because that's the natural assumption when you come home and your second vehicle is missing. If she protests, ask her what you should do if your car is gone and her phone is dead and you can't reach her...and she *doesn't* have your car. Her inability to respect your boundaries is setting *both of you* up for a successful car thief to just...take the car. Should you wait for her to come home and hope the 'vette isn't at a chop shop or wrapped around a tree? How would she feel if your car is stolen by a stranger, and because she always takes it, you don't call the cops for the hours the fucker needs to make it disappear? Can *she* afford to replace your sports car if that happens?\n4. (optional) That you feel incredibly disrespected by her behavior, because it shows you that your wants and needs are not being respected. Sure, this is a small thing, but trust and relationships are built on small things, and are broken the same way. It hurts, and you're hurt, and her feeling like it's not fair only *increases* how hurt you feel, because it's *another* example of disrespect and your needs being discarded. You *want* to trust her. You *need* to trust her. Her behavior is undermining that trust. (If you cannot have this conversation safely, it's time to start questioning everything in your relationship. I would not say this parenthetical statement to her.)\n5. That she will continue to get to use your car, but she does need to ask first because you *really* need to know where your car is and who has it, so you do not call the cops on her by accident. \n6. Explain that if you *ever* come home and see your car is missing and no one asked you if they could use it, your first call *will* be to the cops, because everything else aside, *that's theft.* It's theft if a stranger does it, It's theft if she does it, and it needs to stop happening.\n7. Add that if she can make it a habit to ask before using the car, you will give her a key to the anti-theft device, but that you will expect her to use it when she goes out. You two can also consider a savings fund to buy her her own used sports car that will be as much *hers* as your car is *yours.* \n\nHer choices are to follow your boundaries or lose the use of the car. End of sentence. How you coach this determines if you will still have a girlfriend, and if she blows up over this, it's probably time to start asking for some distance. Because as everyone has said, this is not about the car. This is about how much you can trust her. If she won't respect the car, what will she respect? Where will she draw the line? If she can have an adult conversation about this, there's nothing to worry about. If she can't...well, I had to toss a relationship of similar duration *with a kid involved,* because my ex was not safe. I could not trust him to pay his car insurance, keep his registration current and not go driving on a suspended license *with the kid in the fucking car.* I still bend over backwards to keep him in the kiddo's life, but my safety and her safety come before anything else.

I handled auto claims. when someone who doesn't tries to provide information on the claims process it can cause a lot of frustration.\n\nYou might even say the correct thing, but people hear what they want to hear and spend hours raging at someone who handles claims.\n\nIts about like if I tell someone a scratch should buff right out or they can just pop that dent right out!\n\nThis happened most frequently with agents providing incorrect information.\n\nIf the car is in your shop and repairs are authorized, coverage is not in doubt. Its the *next time* that becomes the problem.\n\nThere is a reason so much documentation is sent out and scripts are read verbatim for certain things.\n\nTelling a person something will be covered outside of a claim with the appropriate information is asking for trouble.\n\nI'd go so far as to say that answering a hypothetical requires enough hedging that its near useless\n\nOnce you say \"this is how it usually works\"provided coverage exists and no exclusions apply\". Wow thats a lot of baggage!\n\nFor clarity I'm not disagreeing with the person you responded to.\n\nWhere I worked not all claim handlers could handle claims where permissive use was potentially involved.

Probably, but people just hear an unqualified yes.\n\nIts really best to encourage people to call the insurance company if they have questions.\n\nfun example, the policy follows the car not the driver right right? ok what is \"the car\"?\n\nYou might think I'm joking. I'm not. I haven't handled a claim since 2012 but I can tell you there is/was an entire section in the policy on what \"your car\" means(Its probably not what you might think).\n\nIt can be the car on the policy, a temporary substitute car, a non owned car....\n\nWait, a car that is literally not \"your car\" is defined as \"your car\" in the policy? Yeah... at least the policy I worked with.\n\nAs with permissive use, not all claims handler could qualify a vehicle if it was other than the vehicle listed on the policy. is OPs vehicle a NoC as per her personal auto policy?\n\nIs a rental a TSC or a NoC? it depends.\n\nIIRC it also needed to be a \"passenger\" vehicle. < 10k lbs/4 wheels (Is my Uhaul covered? maybe?\n\nEach of those has various restrictions. For example Check your insurance policy for how many days a new(to you) car is covered.\n\nIts too long since I handled claims for me to be certain, but iirc a car was no longer a \"non owned car\" if you had access to it over a certain number of days/regular use.\n\nWhat the car was used for could matter too. At the time carrying a passenger for a fee was an exclusion. Not to mention shit like off-roading or street racing (you need you car towed out of where? how did it get there?\n\nTurn out the insurance might not follow a car \"there\"\n\nThen you have the definition of \"loss\" as sudden an accidental.\n\n\nLaws vary from state to state and policies may vary as well.\n\nI'll stress its been quite some time and things do change but the message is sound. redirect questions to the insurance company.\n\nTLR: So much can go wrong, and people usually only find out when they file a claim.", "Disconnect the battery cable . . . .
