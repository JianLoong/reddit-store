If you take the keys with you, it's the beginning of the end. Similarly, an ultimatum wouldn't work for it.\n\nAnd with that said, I totally agree with you about the whole thing otherwise. It's your car, you should have access to it when you want unless you've otherwise agreed to its use elsewhere. But solving the issue by holding the keys is not even just going to prolong the issue, it's going to be worse, because of what u/lovebombme2u is saying.\n\nOne of two things can happen here (and realistically, with any issue)--either they will change, or you will learn to deal with it. If she honestly does not see an issue with what she is doing, she is less likely to change than you are. I'm not saying that is right or wrong, but it's how constant compromises work in a relationship. Sure, sometimes you may meet in the middle, but taking the keys is now how you get there in this situation.", "Nta she doesn't respect you and your boundaries on not taking your stuff without asking. Your not selfish. How can you be selfish when it's your car. She's the selfish one here. Take the keys because she clearly won't listen to what you have to say. If she wants a cool car she can save up too.", "This isn\u2019t true.  In most states, if you live together but don\u2019t pay to put a cohabitants\u2019 name on the policy, they are not covered under the policy.", "If she's not listed on the policy good luck filing a claim", "Upvoted because I know what a Pinto is", "If she needs it to make a sale she should buy her own\u2026 or get a job she\u2019s better at \ud83d\ude02", "> or you will learn to deal with it\n\nWhat the hell kind of compromise is that?  It's HIS car that he bought with HIS money.  He already laid down the rules once and she ignored them.  How many times do you think he needs to talk about it?  Once should be plenty.  \n\nEdit: It's not a situation that he created, she created it.", "If talking isn\u2019t working and you don\u2019t want him to withhold the keys I\u2019m not sure what avenue you want him to take. \n\nHim suffering and being annoyed while she continues to ignore him doesn\u2019t seem reasonable to me.", "Screw that.\n\nIf she fails to see its an issue, that is also another issue, and is certainly one that can lead to a breakup.\n\nThere needs to be a hard line drawn, and if it's not, she is just going to keep doing what she is doing until he makes a big enough stink about it.\n\nThen, she is going to get mad because he is \"getting mad over nothing\".\n\nTaking his keys means the car is no longer in the middle of the power play, and she kinda has to deal with him.", "Or she could respect HIS wishes about HIS property. Her actions say a lot about how she sees the relationship. Right now, based on the post, she feels entitled to do anything she wants regardless of how OP feels. Basically, his feelings don't count for anything. Like someone else said... what's hers is hers and what's his is ours.", "\ud83d\ude02 the struggle is real"]}
