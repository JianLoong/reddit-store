It worked out perfectly.\n\nIf the bride and groom want their guests at their wedding they have to try to accommodate them. Your sister wants a child free wedding and you're not child free and will struggle with childcare and worry the whole time. Your sister should at least attempt to understand.", "NTA because she\u2019s not accepting your answer. Neither of you are AHs regarding the initial choice, but having a childfree wedding means accepting people with children might not attend, either by choice or because they can\u2019t.", "NAH. She is an idiot though. You can't ban all children and expect someone with a breastfeeding baby to show up.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s a child-free wedding. You aren\u2019t able to follow her rule.\nNo harm, no foul.", "Nta. It\u2019s about choices she made hers and you made yours.", "NTA.  I believe in childfree weddings but thems is the breaks.  \n\nWould have been nice if your husband could have watched them but guess not.", "NTA. Maybe a controversial hot take but I find most (certainly not all) people who insist on a childfree wedding are pretty self absorbed. They often seem to want a perfect day, with everyone coming to support them and celebrate with them etc, but fail to understand the difficulties in arranging childcare some people face, exactly like your sister has demonstrated. \n\nIn my opinion, if you really want all your family and friends to celebrate the wedding but also want a childfree wedding, then you should make accommodations to have a \"practice dinner\" or similar event that is kid friendly, if you know that some of the guests will have small children, and also make an effort to reach out individually to those people and say something along the lines of \"while we appreciate it might be hard to arrange care for the kids for the wedding, we're having a celebration dinner the week before at a kid friendly venue and we'd love if you could make it\"\n\nNow I know the AITA crowd loves to spout off about obligations, and there's going to be some who will say you shouldn't have to be obligated to cater to people with kids and make an extra effort to allow those people to be involved, they knew when they had kids there'd be events they couldn't attend, it's their problem and they chose it etc etc, but I find that both callous and inconsistent. I think relationships of all kinds require sacrifice sometimes and if these are people you really want to celebrate with you should make an effort to be accommodating. Sometimes you have to go a bit out of your way to demonstrate to someone that they matter to you and that you want to spend time with them, and it seems weird to me that you'd be upset they can't make it but also not make an effort to ensure they could make it in some other capacity.", "NTA- if people make these choices for their wedding then they have to expect that people will not come. Same with destination weddings. People have other priorities which come first.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t be pressuring you after banning kids from the wedding. She had to know what that would mean for you, and if she didn\u2019t she die now and still isn\u2019t offering to let you bring your kids. \n\nI disagree with the NAH posters, because weddings are about community and family coming together to recognize a social, familial, and legal union. There are plenty of fine people who choose not to have kids. There are very few good people who describe themselves as \u201cChildfree.\u201d We\u2019re talking about people who do not like children, mostly be they don\u2019t want to stop being children themselves, and have their own subreddit who whine and cry about the preset of children in public and at child centered activities/events/facilities.", "NAH. Your circumstances mean you can't attend, and she has the right to have a childfree wedding.", "NAH. She has the  right to  have both a child free wedding and also want her sister there. You have the right to do what you believe is best for your family.", "ESH. A lot of people have child free weddings and I don\u2019t think blaming someone for not wanting a baby screaming at their $1000s+ day is ideal for them. You seem very salty about the child free wedding part but also seem like even if it wasn\u2019t child free, your *feeling like a sack of potatoes and not wanting to be ~uncomfortable~ for 6 hours* seems like this is something you have to tell yourself to not feel like you\u2019re missing out/it\u2019s your choice or that you really didn\u2019t even want to go to begin with. Your sister sucks bc she can\u2019t take a hint that you really and obviously just don\u2019t want to be there. Child free weddings aren\u2019t common, but your dry effortless responses to your sister seem super strange if your relationship with one another is good. Seems like people with kids are mad that people without kids have more leeway and freedom for things and that\u2019s what this seems like which is why there \u201cis no effort to be made\u201d", "YTA - that\u2019s your sisters wedding.

Therefore, don't feel like going is a legitimate reason not to go (if perhaps poorly worded due to everyone's judgement based on that one phrase).\n\nAdd to that the children need to cared for, and making the effort of finding someone suitable because the trusted family members will be at the wedding, is also mentally draining.\n\nNow the OP is also being asked to work with the bridesmaids to co-ordinate dresses. So there's more mentally draining work and possibly physically draining work (due to meeting with people and running around finding a dress etc).\n\nWe don't know how much work is required for the autistic child. I do know it's extremely difficult in many cases. A work colleague has a son on the spectrum who's punched holes in walls, poured water over the parent's bed, close to becoming physically abusive. Aged between 10 to 16 (I've heard the stories during this age time frame). I've also experienced one kid trying to open my car door and I exclaimed \"hey!\" because I thought he was trying to break in (while I was in the locked car). The kid ran off, found his mother and started bawling his eyes out exclaiming he wants to die (because he got the car wrong and was shouted at). The mother spend a lot of time trying to reassure him and quieten him down. This kid was also around 10 to 12 and on the spectrum as I realised while watching the interaction with the mother.\n\nSo the, throw away comment, \"I don't want to make the effort\" or \"I don't feel like going\" can have a lot of emotion behind it and be a result of being emotional, physically and/or mentally drained.

If no reasonable options exist, it\u2019s okay. \n\nBecause it\u2019s your sister, and you said you\u2019re close, I think there is a reasonable expectation that you put some effort into attempting to find a solution. Even if the solution is zooming in to the ceremony while Aunt Linda holds the iPad.
