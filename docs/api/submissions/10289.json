For context, I\u2019m posting from a burner account and names have been changed for privacy reasons. \n\nMy daughter, Rachel, married her childhood sweetheart, Logan. We were family friends at church. My husband and I always hoped that our daughter would marry an amazing Christian man. We were even happier when she started dating Logan. They began dating in middle school and they broke up briefly in their senior year of high school. Full disclosure, they broke up because each of them cheated on the other. The two were engaged at 18 years and were married at 20. From the outside, they were the perfect couple. But this reality crumbled before me when Logan came to our house one night. He had told me Rachel had been having an affair for a year and he caught them in the act in their bed. I could hardly believe my ears. I told him I would fix it. Rachel\u2019s father and I were so disappointed that we didn't allow her to move home. I stayed in close contact with Logan, reminding him of our love for him and that love conquers all. He was willing work on the marriage. But eventually, Logan became non-compliant and stopped answering my messages which upset me. One day, he told me, \"I'm not Rachel's husband anymore. That ship has sailed.\" What Logan fails to remember is he is legally Rachel's husband and matters that concern me about her should concern him too. Logan still filed for divorce only a month later. Rachel is now living with the man she cheated with, but I was still convinced there was hope for people to show Rachel the proper course of action. But it gets much worse. I found out through one of my other children that Logan has a new girlfriend who has moved in with him, while he is still legally married to Rachel. I am so disappointed in each of them for breaking the sacred bond of marriage. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I took measures further and stage an intervention? My idea is to reserve a dining room for the two of them, filled with their wedding pictures and childhood photos together. I feel as if they saw each other again they would be reminded that love conquers all and that the marriage could be saved. Next, all of their family and friends will each weigh in on the sacredness of marriage, we may decide to read some scriptures and powerful quotes about love. But my husband is on Logan's side. I'm so saddened that I do not have my husband's support. He thinks I'm going way too far but many of my friends think it's perfectly appropriate to give it one more shot. So all that being said, would I be the asshole?", "created_utc": 1676699518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11587lq/wibta_for_trying_to_save_my_daughters_marriage/", "score": 543, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That relationship is dead.  She cheated on him twice, how do you expect him to trust or respect her anymore?  It is impossible to have a healthy relationship without trust.\n\nLet them do the mature, adult thing and move on from an irreparable mess.\n\nThis is one of many reasons why it\u2019s not a good idea to push people to marry young.  They haven\u2019t finished growing and often lack the self-knowledge to choose a partner who fulfills their needs.  Because they\u2019re still growing, it\u2019s not uncommon for them to grow apart.\n\nIt\u2019s not your marriage, you need to mind your own business.  There is nothing to save here anyway.", "YTA. They got married far too young and their relationship has run its course. Stay out of it.", "Jumping Jesus on a pogo stick, you would be a massive AH on top of everything else you've done. You are living in a god damned fantasy world if you think you can force them back together just to adhere to **your** religious beliefs. Let it go already. Let me say quite confidently that no one in this scenario other than yourself wants to talk about this anymore", "Since you're saddened and are trying to look at this from a Christian pov, l'll try to answer with that in mind. \n\nYou are worried because they're\n\n>breaking the sacred bond of marriage\n\nby getting divorced, but here's the thing, from a biblical perspective your daughter  broke that bond by cheating on her husband. Luke and Matthew identify sexual immortality as the only reason for divorce. Adultery is included in that term. Paul also considers adultery to be a reason for divorce. Deuteronomy forbids taking back a spouse after the've been with another person. Taking back your cheating spouse is so unheard if biblically that Hosea being ordered to get back with his cheating wife Gomer was considered shocking. So, from s Christian perspective Logan's decision is unproblrmatic.\n\nFrom a non-religious perspective, your husband's got it right. **Stay out of your daughter's marriage!** Your not being supportive and putting your religious views over her well-being does not speak to a great mother-daughter relationship, so she may not have confided in you about things that were going on in her marriage that led to this situation. \n\nIt's great that you're supportive of Logan. But have you even spoken to your daughter to coroborate his version of events or did you simply tell her she cannot stay with you because of what she's done without asking her about her version?\n\nYWBTA if you continue to ignore their wishes and decisions because they don't align with your beliefs and keep getting involved. Be there for them the way rhey need or stay out of it entirely.", "YTA they are adults, and you have NO place to meddle!\nIt is NOT your business. It is not your place to involve yourself in. \n\n\nThis is too outrageous to be real. This is a fake, right?", "YTA. This is literally none of your business. Your daughter ruined the marriage by cheating. She lives with her affair partner. What on earth makes you think this is fixable? He filed for divorce and moved on like he should. You need to accept that your daughter isn\u2019t the woman you think she is/want her to be. Leave Logan alone.", "YTA it\u2019s not your marriage. they are adults. leave them alone", "YWBTA, and honestly the extent to which you\u2019re involving yourself here is just creepy. you can\u2019t try to force other adults to do what you want them to because of your religious fanaticism. you raised a cheater, and you\u2019re going to have to come to terms with that and let her soon-to-be-ex husband get on with his life with someone better.", "YTA and I don\u2019t even have to read anything but the title to confidently say that.", "YTA. This is not the movies where some whacky Parent Trap plan will make them realize they love each other. It is clear that the two married before they knew themselves or their needs and both of them have moved on happily with another person. Let them be happy apart instead of miserable together.", "It sounded like you were claiming to be a Christian, but then you started judging the actions of your daughter and her childhood sweetheart, and then you started trying to interfere with them, so I'm confused about your actual religious views.\n\nINFO", "Yes, you would be an asshole. These are adults who are figuring out some complicated stuff in their own lives. You cannot force them to live the way you want them to live. Back off. If you keep pushing this, you're going to lose any relationship with your daughter.", "YWBYA. What\u2019s wrong with you? Don\u2019t do this.", "YTA. I mean this in the kindest way, but what planet are you from? I seriously got sick reading this that you think you have authority over two grown-ups and that you think this ridiculous plan would work.", ">Logan became non-compliant and stopped answering my messages\n\nErm.... You do realise they are actual humans and not your doll playthings right? Be annoyed they are not being obedient little Christians if you need some moral righteousness, but BOTH have very much moved on from a marriage they likely felt pressured into in the first place. \n\nYWBTA.  Time for you to move on as well.  Logan isn't your son in law anymore.", "You\u2019re planning to reserve a dining room filled with photos of them and somehow trick them into both attending, brow beat them with scriptures and then what? You\u2019re going to lock them in there until they magically realise that they love each other and that past hurts are all erased? That stuff only works in books.\n\nYou\u2019ve already meddled far too much in a relationship that isn\u2019t yours. \n\nAbsolutely, without question, YWBTA if you do this.", "YWBTA it is not your marriage. You've expressed your opinion (overly expressed) and, to be quite honest, you've meddled enough. They are adults who can make their own decisions, and if you were to stage an \"intervention\" you would not only drive them further apart, but further from you as well.", "Thou shalt not meddle. \n\nYWBTA.", "\"I will fix it,\" she says about her adult age child, lol. Yo, helicopter control freak mom. Butt out!\n\nYour daughter is an adult and will make her own choices, good or bad, with or without your help.  You're so disappointed in her that you've taken your SIL's side at times, shame on you.  What happened to your conditional love for her? \n\nYTA", "It\u2019s literally none of your business. You\u2019re caught up in your own dreams of what their future looks like without considering what they want. They\u2019ve both clearly moved on. You need to accept that. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a surprising outcome. They got together/married way too young, without experiencing the world at all. Of course they didn\u2019t last. \n\nYou trying to puppeteer their lives is taking a giant leap over their boundaries, so yes. YWBTA. Stay in your lane and let them live their lives.", "YWBTA. They're adults. Let them handle their own affairs. They are the ones who understand the situation more. They have hurt each other already. Do you want them to keep hurting each other more?", "YWBTA. your daughter is a grown ass adult. Mind your own business. Her marriage is her business it doesn't concern you.  The only 2 people who knew what went wrong in that relationship and how to proceed forward is your daughter and her ex husband. You're not in a position to pass judgment on them or their relationship.", "YTA- Stay out of your adult child\u2019s relationships. I\u2019m wondering if she didn\u2019t feel pressured into marrying him so young to appease your ideals.", "Absolutely, YWBTA. It sounds like Rachel and Logan had what turned out to be a starter marriage very young, they started growing apart, Rachel wanted out, so she blew the whole thing up by having an affair. Logan, being a self-respecting person himself, grew to know better than to try to force something to work that Rachel didn\u2019t want to work, and moved on with his life. It\u2019s all over but the technical legalities, which sound like are in progress. This is a very common tale, and you don\u2019t have the right to try to unmake their decision to walk away from this marriage.  It sounds like you also need to be reminded that your daughter is not an extension of you, and her choices in life and relationships are not about you. They\u2019re not for you to \u201cfix\u201d and your husband is right that your proposed intervention is absolutely unhinged, ridiculous, and definitely going too far. That would do nothing to reunite them, but it\u2019ll probably inspire her to cut you out of her life altogether.", "Why not take this energy and put it into getting to know her new bf? You can't change what happened, but there's no use ruining your relationship with her either.", "YTA.  Your role in your adult daughter's life is not to guide her, but to try to influence her and above all, to love her.  I think you owe these two a huge apology, as they were obviously not ready to settle into marriage and might not have if you had influenced them to wait.\n\nYour daughter needs your nonjudgmental love and support whilst she decides for herself what she wants, and beyond this, you should keep your hyper-judgmental opinions to yourself.\n\nIf you go forward with an \"intervention\", you will cause tremendous pain and possibly alienate your daughter for a very long time.  You will not achieve the desired results, and shouldn't want to.  Why would you want your daughter to stay in an unhappy marriage out of fear of your disapproval?", "YTA. Get a life and get out of your kid\u2019s personal business. This is none of your business. They both are done with the marriage. All you care about is that he\u2019s Christian and I guarantee she only married him because you forced the issue. He owes you nothing and the fact that you didn\u2019t even try and help your daughter is pathetic at best.", "YTA.  This is a way to drive them both away from you forever, not back together.  They probably should never have married in the first place, and obviously they don\u2019t share your view of marriage.  Leave them alone.", "YTA Looks like 'Rachel' has made her choice, do your job and support your daughter", "YTA. Butt out", "Is there anything in the bible that states one must not shove ones nose in other people's business? Genuinely asking.", "YTA. You are definitely crazy. Stop torturing Logan", "It is sad your daughter cheated, but that\u2019s God\u2019s will for you pushing them to marry young. YTA. Hope you didn\u2019t piss off the big man too much!", "YTA - Logan didn't cheat on his daughter, thank God he got himself out of a lot of trouble.\nDid you really think he would stay married to his daughter after she cheated on him for a year and had to find out by catching her in the act in their bed ? Please stop raving.", "YTA and more than a little nuts too. Who gets this involved in their kid's marriage! Or goes on and on about how great their son-in-law is, and then wants him back with the person that cheated on him. Find a hobby that doesn't involve someone else's relationship.", "YWBTA\n\nReligious aside no one, men or woman after caught their gf/wife in the act doing it with someone else on their own bed. Especially if it their marital bed. The hurt, the pain etc it's enough traumatic for them. It's an insults and disgusting.\n\nTalking about religious, get out from whatever ere you're in.. This is not the era when you caught your wife or husband in a act of adultery and just pretend everything is OK because it's a sin to get divorced. No one can live with their cheating partner and pretend forget and forgive, yeah maybe the forgive part but to forget? Enough giving them mental illness. \n\nStop bothering your ex son in law.. Let him be happy, doesn't matter if he brings 1 gf, 2 gf or an harem and starts living together, because all this started when your own daughter can't keep her.. Close. If you want to talk about religious start with your own daughter because she definitely doing it wrong or doing it first, I'm saying this because this \n\n>I found out through one of my other children that Logan has a new girlfriend who has moved in with him, while he is still legally married to Rachel. \n\n\nRachel legally married, everyone know she's married but she doing it with some else, \nLogan do it when he have the intention for ending the marriage like you said he filed for the divorce and get a new gf. \n\nI'm sorry if I come hard but just don't make your ex son in law more hurt with your involvement. The ship is already sail. He happy with someone else and she with her 'affair/adultery partner. The more you push or starts spouting about love conquer all, faith or God you make them run as far as they can and avoiding you. \n\nAnd last listen to your husband and see it from his point of view. If you get involved he will think' what she up to? 'did she do it too? And you might ruin your marriage too..", "YTA.  And creepy.  Stay out of it- these are adults.", "YTA their non-existent love won't conquer all.", "Yta- for what you\u2019ve done and what you\u2019re thinking about doing and if you keep going this route you might permanently destroy any hopes of ever having a relationship with your daughter again.", "YTA - and then some. This is not your marriage and you are overstepping. Trying this stunt will only push you daughter and ex SIL away from you. They are adults, treat them with the respect the deserve and drop the \u2018I know best\u2019 attitude. \n\nYou care more about the \u2018marriage\u2019 than your own daughter. You care more about what people will think than the fact your child was unhappy in her marriage. Love doesn\u2019t conquer all and it\u2019s obvious to everyone else that these two have moved on. You should as well.", "Wow, Mom, you're just scary. None of this is any of your business. They have both moved on, regardless of an actual divorce decree. It's time for you to move on too.", "I could barely even finish reading the post. \nYTA.  Not your marriage, not your concern. Period.  Put your bible down and back slowly away.  Let them handle their marriage (or lack thereof).  If those \"sacred bonds\" just aren't there, trust me YOU aren't going to suddenly make them happen.", "YTA.\n\nYou're going overboard to try to save something that cannot be saved. Your daughter cheated on Logan with another man and Logan caught them in an intimate act in their marital bed. Worse yet, your daughter is now living with that same man and likely continuing to have intimate relations with him. And you're disappointed in Logan?\n\nYour daughter is the one who destroyed and refused to respect the bonds of marriage. If you're going to start anywhere, start with the adulteress you raised. Leave poor Logan alone.", "YWBTA\n\nThe marriage isn't worth saving. The damage is already done. It's like trying to fix a broken mirror, better to leave it alone then try to put it back together. A broken mirror when fixed is just going to have the cracks of reminders of the past.", "YWBTA. They are adults who clearly are interested in other people. Your intervention will not change anything, will piss them off, and will insert you in something that, frankly, is none of your business. And if you want a biblical response, try Matthew 19:8-9. Logan has biblical grounds for divorce because your daughter committed adultery.", " You are unhinged. YWBTA. Shit, you ARE being the asshole currently. Leave poor Logan alone, sounds like your daughter has done enough to him.", "YTA. I really wish that I didn\u2019t believe this could be real, but fundamentalist religious parents have a tendency to  push the boundaries of sanity for control over their children. Apparently for you, this doesn\u2019t stop with your daughter being married and starting her own family. I cringed that you would use the word \u2018non compliant\u2019 as it demonstrates this. A grown adult does not have a duty to comply with whatever harebrained scheme you have cooked up. You don\u2019t need to work on their nonexistent marriage. Stop. Get a hobby. And maybe some new friends.", "YTA. Accept the child you brought up fucked up. She hurt Logan beyond repair. She broke her vow to not cheat. Accept that. \n\nI would never be with someone who\u2019s cheated on me. They\u2019ve shown me they don\u2019t love me and I\u2019d never be able to trust them again. Without trust, you have nothing. \n\nYou\u2019re crazy and unhinged. Nobody will thank you for your meddling. The relationship is over. Let everybody move on, especially you.", "YTA. You have to let them handle this. It\u2019s their marriage and they\u2019re adults. I have two daughters. One is married and has two kids and the other is engaged. The only reason I would ever insert myself into their relationships is if they were being abused.", "YTA. You are the only one interested in saving this marriage. It's not yours to save.\n\nYour daughter is not interested in saving this marriage. \n\nLogan is not interested in saving this marriage. \n\nStop wasting your time and energy. This ship has sailed, sunk, and rests on the ocean floor.", "YWBTA - do not do this. Let them live their lives. Leave Logan alone!", "YTA, and honestly, this response would be inappropriate for literally any couple who are in the process of separation and divorce, regardless of the ages and circumstances involved. Absolutely no one is going to genuinely change their mind about ending a relationship because of some pictures and a ridiculous amount of pressure from their family. At most, they may feel bullied enough to say they're going to give it another shot to end the show, and then likely stop speaking to everyone involved. You make it sound like it's a decision they've come to lightly. It's clearly not. Please stop trying to fix other people's lives and let them make their own choices for how to live it.", "YWBTA\n\nThey are/ were the married pair, and THEY are the ones who should want to give this another shot. You can't want that on their behalf. \n\nOnly if they wanted that, then it would be nice for you to help in intervening and helping to fix things. But right now sounds like both parties are done.", "They were married too young. They don\u2019t want to be with each other.  It\u2019s better to separate now before they have kids than to continue being miserable together. Leave them alone. They\u2019re both adults and know their relationship better than you. \n\nYTA", "YTA. What exactly are you trying to save here? The \u201csacred bond\u201d was already broken when your daughter cheated. I\u2019m pretty sure adultery is frowned upon in most religions.\n\nYou can\u2019t put this back together. You CAN ruin your relationships with both Rachel and Logan if you continue to push.\n\nI get that you\u2019re sad and disappointed, but you aren\u2019t part of this marriage.

Not how it works.", "YTA\n\nI mean, everyone in this story sucks, but on the matter of trying to \u201csave\u201d your adulterous daughters \u201cmarriage\u201d you are the asshole. Their demands that you leave well enough alone on the matter is entirely justified.\n\nSo why are you forcing the issue.\n\nYou raised a good Christian daughter, and she married a good Christian man!\n\nAnd then you learned what good Christians are like.  And now they both want nothing to do with each other, and have failed to meet your every expectation.  But instead of questioning the purpose of a black and white viewpoint of assumed reality you decided to become a practicing Christian yourself,  interfering in someone else\u2019s union over whom you feel entitled to a sense of control, demanding adherence to a particular set of rules you picked out of a book you like, in service of conveying obedience to specific principles you deem exemplary.  \n\n\nBut why tho? Why do you feel the need to meddle in their (actual) affairs?  Your daughter is kind of a hot mess and Logan turned out to be every bit a Christian man (terrible)  and somehow I have the feeling if your daughter told this story she\u2019d explain how the only thing you wanted out of her was to get this Logan kid to become your son.  You seem more concerned about keeping him in the good Christian family, but they don\u2019t want each other.", "Omg. Please do this and have your kids film it. It will go viral for sure. You'll be the star of r/JustNoMIL for a long time.\n\nTheir relationship is dead! They've moved on. Time to stop believing in imaginary connections that don't exist. Logan deserves better than someone who's cheated on him multiple things. Surely your God can see that. YTA.", "YTA. Maybe she\u2019s with someone 15 years older than her because of your archaic views and trying to push two people who have REPEATEDLY cheated on each other together. If your family wasn\u2019t so gung-ho on Logan her childhood sweetheart \u2764\ufe0f maybe the pressure of marriage and it\u2019s \u201csanctity\u201d led her to this.

They got together as children, they married as children, and now that they are adults with fully developed brains they have grown apart.  That happens much more frequently than you might realize (especially if you don\u2019t socialize with too many people outside your church circle).  They both had problems with infidelity even as teenagers, so it was a bit naive of everyone to think their marriage would really last.  Their relationships with their new partners may or may not last, but the reality is your daughter needs you right now.  Be angry with her for her actions, but at the end of the day she is your child.  Help get her on the right track instead of condemn her.

Good for him that he has enough self respect to leave a toxic marriage. I hope he finds someone who loves him unconditionally and won\u2019t cheat. This marriage does not need to be saved and they have both moved on.", "As Logan said, that ship has sailed. *Unless both parties are \"all in\" about salvaging the marriage, it's not going to be saved.*\n\n  I understand that you wish that they could work through this and be happy, but neither of them wants that.

Stay out of it.  Once someone cheats, the marriage is never the same.  That's on your daughter.   In my opinion,  he is not cheating.  While legally married,  that's a formality.  They are broken up and he is free to be happy with someone who doesn't cheat on him. \n\nAlso, as someone who was raised this exact way, married at 17 to the guy I met in church at 15, please see that your influence on their relationship is already too much.  It's not about what you want for them, these are their lives.", "YTA. This is so far past the normal level of wanting to help people I can\u2019t even process it.", "YTA. Butt out of their business.

Hope this finds everyone well. I'm really struggling right now. For context, I\u2019m posting from a burner account and names have been changed for privacy reasons. \n\nMy daughter, Rachel, married her childhood sweetheart, Logan. We were family friends at church. My husband and I always hoped that our daughter would marry an amazing Christian man. We were even happier when she started dating Logan. They began dating in middle school and they broke up briefly in their senior year of high school. Full disclosure, they broke up because each of them cheated on the other. The two were engaged at 18 years and were married at 20. From the outside, they were the perfect couple. But this reality crumbled before me when Logan came to our house one night. He had told me Rachel had been having an affair for a year and he caught them in the act in their bed. I could hardly believe my ears. I told him I would fix it. Rachel\u2019s father and I were so disappointed that we didn't allow her to move home. I stayed in close contact with Logan, reminding him of our love for him and that love conquers all. He was willing work on the marriage. But eventually, Logan became non-compliant and stopped answering my messages which upset me. One day, he told me, \"I'm not Rachel's husband anymore. That ship has sailed.\" What Logan fails to remember is he is legally Rachel's husband and matters that concern me about her should concern him too. Logan still filed for divorce only a month later. Rachel is now living with the man she cheated with, but I was still convinced there was hope for people to show Rachel the proper course of action. But it gets much worse. I found out through one of my other children that Logan has a new girlfriend who has moved in with him, while he is still legally married to Rachel. I am so disappointed in each of them for breaking the sacred bond of marriage. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I took measures further and stage an intervention? My idea is to reserve a dining room for the two of them, filled with their wedding pictures and childhood photos together. I feel as if they saw each other again they would be reminded that love conquers all and that the marriage could be saved. Next, all of their family and friends will each weigh in on the sacredness of marriage, we may decide to read some scriptures and powerful quotes about love. But my husband is on Logan's side. I'm so saddened that I do not have my husband's support. He thinks I'm going way too far but many of my friends think it's perfectly appropriate to give it one more shot. So all that being said, would I be the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Finally my ex SIL had enough and left. Her church then kicked her out for not trying hard enough to save the marriage. \n\nSo sadly, I believe this 100%. Also the OP WBTAH for sure.

She basically said that taking the physical pressure off the relationship can let you think with a clear head and figure out what's lust vs love.\n\nNeedless to say, I did not share that life lesson with my Sunday school class, but I'm really glad that I listened, because I've seen a lot of people get married right out of high school just so they could get laid.", "I have been pissing people off for over 4 decades') glad you liked it:)", "This is debatable", "Ehhhh in my experience older men are much more likely to be selfish and not care about the pleasure of other's in bed.

Basically, don't point out and try to fix their mistakes and instead work on your own life. \n\nCause, yeah, your daughters behaviors heavily signify that you have some issues that you're using scripture to justify. Like, yeah, the bible says divorce is bad but the bible also says adultery is bad and that it's okay to divorce an adulterer. Your daughter is an adulterer.\n\nI think therapy would be helpful for you to cope with the divorce (there are christian therapists) since it is a point of struggle for you. I hope you pursue therapy because God does want you to be the best you that you can be and this behavior is not your best you. \n\nYou're letting the devil quote scripture in your head to twist your faith.
