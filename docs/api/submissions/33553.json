I would of told him to fuck off as well. Hope it didn\u2019t ruin your wedding.", "Your fault bro honestly. Old people can sometimes be very weird and have weird charasteristics and personalities. These charackter traits may be an consequenze or aftermath or symptoms of some illnes he has or had. And on top of that, he may know your parents better than you do or atleast maybe knows enough of them to understand that it was in fact your parents fault that you were in this dilemma in the first place because of bad decision making, (I can just assume as you haven't given more information). So maybe he knew that your parents coudn't handle money or he may knew that your parents made a bad decision or maybe he had a feeling like your parents were after his money OR MAYBE he has a feeling that his relatives in general are after his money and is just being cautios (maybe he already has had a situation where a relative where after his money, maybe those people were your parents in their early years of marriage.). The point is, there could be many reasons for why he did what he did. As you have not written more information I again can just assume. \n\nSo to put it simply, it was on you to find out if he was really that much of a bad person or not, but YOU only counted the things he did wrong and where you think that it all was his fault. To me this sounds like this is done by your parents by talking bad about him in your presence or even directly telling you how bad he is. Because you didn't mention any of his charackter traits, personalities to describe what kind of human he is. So you judged upon what you heard about him which already is a bad and not-smart way of tackling this situation.\n\nBut what really stands out the most is the fact that he was being invited. As he was being invited and came all the way to your wedding (if you like it or not) he has the right of stay there. If he was not invited you could have asked him to leave, even though I woudn't even do that, but logically speaking you can only then throw out an uninvited guest. But as he was invited you do not have the right to throw him out UNLESS he SAID or DID something that REALLY breaks the limit. Him saying your dad is a loser, with all respect, is not even close to throw out an invited relative (Although it DOES matter how and where and in which tone and with which intention he said it.)

You said that when you were in need, by the way, glad you got on your feet and are starting this new chapter in your life, you called him and asked him for money and for help and stated that he was rich and had a lot of connections. Some people can act a certain kind of way when they feel like all people do is call them when they need something instead of just calling them to just chat or see how they're doing. Not saying that your uncle is a savior because he sounds like garbage, but sometimes especially with family people don't want to help others because they feel like they're being used. I have some members of my family who, regardless of their income or financial situation, will not help other people because they never hear from that person when everything is going well and they never hear from that other person just to chat or just to see how that family member is doing. Instead, they only hear from that individual when they need something from them. Sometimes people can feel used and that their only value is just for money and to bail their family out when they need something. That might be the reason your uncle didn't help you guys.

I have always assumed that I am getting nothing from anyone so try to treat people with love, kindness and respect for who they are rather than how much money they have. \n\nI don't talk to my dad. I doubt I will get anything when he dies or at least I've assumed that I won't because of his awful wife. My mum will most likely have to sell her house for care when she's older. My grandparents are either dead or have so many grandkids that I doubt there will even be a book or spoon to be handed down. \n\nI got a shock last year when my grandpa left me a very small amount. I assumed he was leaving everything to everyone else, not because I was an arse or anything but because I was always honest in our weekly chats how important that time calling him was and then only thing that I wanted was the picture of a train from a magazine he was featured in, a list of the jazz songs he'd recommend and the bell he used to ring for food when we were kids. He left most of his money and wealth to my sister who had cared for him and my mum, which was totally understandable. \n\nI still can't come to think about that money because I just miss him so much that I can't come to remove the weekly alarm to call him. \n\nOver the years I've heard so many stories from people where their grandparents had people coming in at the end of their life to \"care for them\" because they wanted to get the will changed to them getting the money only to find out they were hoping on getting was already gone.", "One of my favorite tongue-in-cheek jokes is, \"money can't buy happiness but at least it keeps the kids in touch.\"", "Yup! This is why people take sides against her.", "> Sadly, this is a definite \"absolutely yes\" for a lot of people.\n\nI'll admit....I have a price. How expensive are we talking?", "My ex-FIL treated his wife terribly, mostly emotionally. He gave her an expensive piece of jewelry every Christmas as if to make up for it.", "I hope we hear a huge plot twist in a few years, like \"uncle left everything to me when he died because I didn't kiss his ass like the rest of the family, aita?\"", "Average capitalism fans", "You automatically (*should*) get a certain amount of respect for being human. For existing. \n\nMore respect can accumulate for being kind or working hard or singing well or somehow enhancing your self. \n\nYou also get respect for standing up for yourself.\n\nI'm 65 and have always replied to the 'respect your elders' with \"Some elders don't deserve respect\".", "\u201cThe older I grow, the more I distrust the familiar doctrine that age brings wisdom.\u201d  H.L.

The older a person gets, the more they have to understand that in order to get respect, you have to give it.", "Money absolutely gives you power.

OP had the right to tell him to leave but the way he did it was very badly judged.", "But as a guest, would you have known the context of what he was yelling about? Or would you just have seen the groom yelling at an old man?", "> people will remember that\n\nOkay and?", "While NTA, I would have smiled at the uncle and responded that it's only because of your father and mother was he on the invitation list. When we needed you, you weren't there. Enjoy the wedding.  Keep the gift.", "Maybe being mature and controlled doesn't work with uncle. Maybe Op had to get loud and nasty with him to get his point across. Some people think politeness and good manners are a sign of weakness.

Even though I have more medical knowledge than my sister, I will not take care of the monster.", "I also don't talk to my father. When he dies he'll probably have drunk away all of his money anyway. My grandparents died before I was 18, except for his mother, but in my country most people don't write a will anyway, so everyone gets what the law dictates. I live with my own mother and we are raising my son together, so the small apartment we own will be my only inheritance, but I already own half of it anyway. I have more distant cousins who inherit so much property because my family is technically dying out. Like people with several kids don't have any grandkids. Sometimes I feel a bit jealous, because my mum and I had to work for everything we have, and some people just get this windfall of money and property. So maybe if I had a rich uncle I would do a little A kissing. Though I doubt I'd actually do it.", "I'm sorry for the loss of your grandfather.

I know my mom got pissed because a distant cousin of mine (who she insisted I invite) was late and somehow didn\u2019t get a seat but I don\u2019t know how late they were.

My father is a great actor. If you met him, you'd think he's a great guy. \n\nHe pretended to my mum that he had money. He was actually broke. They had an international relationship, so my mum moved to the US for him. There she had to find work without speaking much English, and when she cleaned houses, he made fun of her. She had very good jobs at home, including modelling. When she got pregnant, he totally ignored it and even went on a two-week holiday without her. A lot of other small things happened that showed that he didn't care about me or her. \nShe left him shortly after I was born and moved back home with me. Throughout my life he gaslit me with \"we don't have a relationship because you're not trying hard enough\". He was originally from the same place my mum was, but they didn't meet when they were younger. Anyway he partially moved back and spread all sorts of lies about us. On my 30th birthday he told his mother that he wouldn't come to my birthday because I didn't respond to a text he sent. My aunt, his sister, whispered to me that actually, his friend was having a barbecue. So I decided I've had enough of the lies, the gaslighting, all the little things that happened throughout the years, and I just wasn't going to deal with him anymore. It was a huge relief.

It wasn't mentioned in post so can only speculate. For me it's not about caving into what other people think. Should it be considered? Yes but it shouldn't drive the issue. My mindset would be \"Hey you are fucking with my vibe so please leave and goodbye. Gonna enjoy my day.\" I just think there's sometimes a time and a place for things.
