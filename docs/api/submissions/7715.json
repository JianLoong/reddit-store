It may be a little harsh, but sometimes it's warranted when people don't get it. He needs to understand that a work-from-home position doesn't mean you're always available. If you worked in an office, would he show up there and ask you to stop what you're doing to send an email for him? If he can't do it himself, he needs to realize he's on your time, not his own.", "NTA, if he's expecting you to send his emails and treats you like a maid/secretary he's probably using weaponized incompetence to get what he wants. Your own life and your kid always comes first!", "NTA. Is he your father an adult or a child? Sending emails isn't hard, plus you're not being paid to be his secretary. He SHOULD learn how to do it on his own and he probably KNOW how to. He's likely just lazy AF.  I'm genuinely annoyed for you OP.", "Weaponized incompetence. \n\nNTA. \n\nWould he have come to your office? Would he do this to his father? Sign dad up for classes at the local college or senior center. Put a sign on your door when you are at work that says no knocking.", "You should have a talk with him about boundaries - but you are currently living in his home and he's doing you a favor. So maybe consider paying back the favor by helping him? Maybe set a certain time a day to help him or something like that.\n\nI can't really figure out if E S H or N A. Maybe a little bit of both?", "NTA teach your dad to send an email and tell him not to interrupt you during work unless he's injured and needs to go to the hospital.", "Nope. NTA", "NTA technically, but why don't you just teach him how to send emails? He does need your help, and it's very likely he spent a good 18 years of his life helping you. It couldn't hurt to offer to teach him.", "NTA for setting boundaries.  But a little bit the AH for snapping at him.  Be clear about when you are and are not available to help him with things.", "That's a great idea. Thank you for that.", "My dad has been like that with plenty of things, not only technology. I remember being all focused studying for exams or whatever and he knocking on my door all the time with the most stupid and repetitive requests. When I moved out I even installed a remote control software to \"help\" him (in other words, make for him) with whichever IT question he asked one million times before (and I taught him how to solve himself). Until I got fed up realising he's not dumb or something, he simply finds way easier to make other people do the things he's not willing go put effort on. I'm now LC with him, and finally relaxed.", "My new house is currently in the process of being built. Once it's done, I'm out!!!", "Don't assume things.\n\nAlso, emailing has been around for a really long time and this father should know how to do that.", "That's where you're wrong. He wasn't the best father. Growing up, he would make me stop studying to make him something to drink.", "You kind of owe him for letting you stay with him while your house is built.  Set boundaries around your other responsibilities, but maybe find some time to help him too.", "Why not rent or find a hotel", "You\u2019re grown up now\u2014sounds like it\u2019s time for him to do stuff for himself. He\u2019s going to throw a tantrum and pout and act like a child instead of an adult, but that embarrassment is on him and not you. NTA. Time to cut the cord.", "Typically during working hours you're meant to work. I doubt OP's job description includes \"drop all work to help father whenever he wants\"", "I'm not talking about helping him whenever he wants.  I'm talking about making time after dinner or something.", "I agree with that, but the whole post is about him bugging OP during working hours so saying \"you kinda owe him\" doesn't sit right with me", "In her post she mentions helping him the first time. It's clear she doesn't consistently tell him she can't help", "Well it looks like the father is indeed interrupting OP during work hours. That's pretty rude...like what you would expect from a 2 yr old.", "How old is this guy? Does he have dyslexia or some other impairment which makes it hard to send emails? Because, you know...it's not that hard. My 94 year old MIL handles it with ease.\n\nNTA but I would be trying to find a different living situation and a lock for my door.", "NTA, but your father is a major ah", "Well, if it was a REAL job she'd be in an office, right? Besides, she's only a girl, how important can her job be? /s", "Libraries often have private rooms you can check out! Sometimes you\u2019re lucky enough to have projectors and screens inside.", "Um, did you read past the title? She made time the first time he asked DURING WORK HOURS. He needs to back off when she\u2019s working. He can either wait until she\u2019s done work (and, btw, not actively caring for her child), or he can learn to do things for himself. Demanding her time just because he has no self control is wrong. NTA.", "$", "NTA. Email has been around for decades and the format hasn't changed much.", "NTA. I feel for you as I live with my mom (post divorce) and I have to lock my door for meetings and interviews because she walks in, sees me with over ear headphones and will start talking anyway until I TELL her I\u2019m in meetings lol. It\u2019s gotten better but it was hell at first. \nI disagree with you having to leave home to get work done because it defeats the purpose of WORK FROM HOME. Instead I would set aside 15-20 minutes a day to assist him with whatever he needs. Block that time on your calendar and he can get all his tech needs met then.", "NTA but you need a hard boundary with your father. Either there are times you're available to him or you're flatly not.", "Are you living in his house?", "NTA. Your dad, your rules", "Nta. If one wants help with something, its either a) wait until the other person has finished whatever they need to do and have a free time for it; or b) learn to do it yourself.\nSending an e-mail isnt so hard so he can easily learn to do it himself. It seems to be the case of learned helplessness or smth. Maybe you can lock the door during work time and use headphones to ignore him, or smth similar.", "NTA\nI think some people don't understand that working from home responsibilities are the same as \" tethered \" to a desk in an office responsibilities.  You are being paid to get stuff done.\nPerhaps your dad needs to take a computer class at the senior center.", "NTA see if anywhere local to you has a internet basics class which includes how to send email and sign your dad up. He obviously has time during the day and it will be good for him to learn a new skill and find people other than you to bother while you\u2019re working.", "NTA\u2026 could you talk to your dad, and maybe set aside a specified time daily to help him? Maybe 30 minutes after work?\n\nEdited to fix a typo", "NTA. Apologize for snapping, but he has to wait for you to help him after work, and your child has been attended to first. Then, you'll be able to help him to learn. But it is better for all if he learns how to do it himself so that he doesn't have to wait. Maybe tell him your window of time is 7 to 7:30 PM that he can ask you his questions.", "NTA? \"If I was a professor teaching a class right now, you wouldn't interrupt me. This is my job. If you ever want help again, let me work in peace.\"", "NTA. If the emails, etc. are not important  enough for him to learn to send by himself, they are certainly  NOT important enough to warrant  interrupting  your paid work.", "Clearly we need INFO\n\nWhat\u2019s the topics of his prolific emailing?", "NTA - although I don\u2019t agree with telling your dad that he isn\u2019t your biggest priority I think that you need to manage him. If he wants help from you he needs to come with all the things he wants help with in one go. If there is anything else that comes later it should be added the next day. \n\nGetting helped once in the day is ok but he shouldn\u2019t come a second time and demand more help. \n\nQuota: once per day and apart from that you offer to teach him how to do it on his own should he need anything more done the same day. That is at least an incentive for him as your store is closed."]}
