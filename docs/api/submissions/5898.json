I pursued my masters degree while he built up a very successful business and ended up selling it for a lot of money (10m+). \n\nAround last year we found out he had a terminal illness and he ended up passing away. He ended up drafting a will where I got everything except a few thousand dollars that were given to his parents.\n\n**What happened**\n\nMy in-laws found out I got everything and asked me for the things. I said no. They then started pestering me for everything(the house, money, property, his belongings, etc). The things my in-laws want are very sentimental to me as they belonged to my late husband. They kept guilt tripping me and trying to manipulate me.\n\nOn top of that, I don't think my husband would've wanted them to have much as nearing the end of his life his parents never visited him and often made homophobic remarks. I think they were expecting they would get all the money and didn't need to act nice to leech off him anymore.\n\nI don't think I'm being unreasonable, but my friends and his family are berating me for being entitled and leeching off him.

Im angry on your behalf at this point.\n\nI am so sorry you're going through all this stress.", "NTA- \n\nEntitled is only a bad thing when you are acting as those you deserve something you don't have a claim to. \n\nThis is your husband's things, that are yours by law. You are entitled to them- because they are yours. The people ACTING entitled are the ones who are trying to bully you into giving them what you don't want to give them. \n\nI would get a lawyer- and if there is anything sentimental from his childhood like pictures or medals or something I would probably give that back because it probably means much more to them than you- but other than that it's your choice.", "NTA.  He was your husband and he made a will laying out his wishes.  You are his primary heir and he wanted you to have his property.  Get a restraining order on his parents and get friends who are willing to support YOU.\n\nIf his parents just wanted a memento or two like a couple of his shirts, that's one thing, but this is obviously a cash grab from their dead child whom they did not approve of.  Screw them.", "NTA. If your husband had wanted those things to go to his parents, he would have put it in his will. You\u2019re under no obligation to give them anything. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA hire a lawyer and have the lawyer tell them to piss off.

Obviously you have enough money to move away, you might want to consider starting over.  And give them nothing.", "Even without a will, your late husband's estate belongs to you, the spouse. Those things are yours, by law, to do with as you please.

If they gave him a certain piece of furniture, I would probably give them that and what was already in the will. \n\nBUT\u2026.I would talk to a lawyer first before giving anything just in case it messes with what is stated in the will and not give the in-laws an opening to sue for more stuff.", "NTA.  You are going to be happiest if you follow your heart.  Your husband gave most to you for a reason which deserves to be honored.  Happy New Year.", "NTA\n\nYour husband made it clear what he wanted to go to you and what he wanted to go to his family by leaving a will. If you have a lawyer, talk to them and ask them to send a letter to his parents stating that they have already received what their son intended them to have and that they should cease and desist any and all contact regarding receiving any further property or possessions from his estate. They have no legal standing. \n\nFriends who do not support you in this are either afraid of conflict or are not your friends. Tell them that this is what your husband wanted and expressed in his will and it's how it's going to be and that's the end of the discussion. True friends will respect you on this. Lose the ones who don't. \n\nI'm very sorry for your loss and the extra stress your husband's family is placing on you. Stand strong.", "NTA. His parents raised your late husband as they should do given they are his parents. I have a feeling your husband would have left them more in his will if their support warranted it\u2014but you described them being unsupportive, not present when he was ill/dying, and also homophobic, so clearly not supportive of him, you, or your marriage. Meanwhile, you stood by your husband (and he by you). Don\u2019t feel guilty that he left you with everything of both financial and not mental value. Clearly, he wanted you to be set/secure and to take care of you.\n\nIf there is an item that is sentimental to them but not so much to you and you feel good about sharing it, then that\u2019s a nice gesture but not necessary. If there are childhood family photos and you can share copies, that\u2019s lovely. But don\u2019t feel obligated or guilted into such gestures. \n\nLastly, my condolences for your loss. I hope it brings comfort to know your husband is forever in your heart, sharing your love, and looking out for you in his way.", "NTA. If they were asking for some small items that have sentimental value to them and not really to you, that might be okay. But his money and house? Clearly they are trying to manipulate you for the sake of money. Because they made up some narrarive in their head that they deserve it more than you do. The worst kind of entitlement. Your husband *choose* to leave those things to *you* and you were his *husband*. Nobody should have these things but you.\n\nTell them to stop harrasing you and block them. If they keep bothering you, you can go to the police for harrasment. I would cut off those \"friends\" as well.", "NTA. Btw, you need new friends.", "NTA here. While I would look for something small to part with, you're under no obligation to do so. He left you everything for a reason.

It's one thing to ask for some sentimental items but it sounds like they want the money which he apparently did not want them to have.", "Block them all. You have a will.

When you said things, i thought you meants sentimental stuff, like things from when he was a kid.. but wanting a house and a watch collection? No, they don't want 'things' they see dollar signs.

It isn\u2019t clear if you met when you were both in middle school, or if only you were in middle school and he was older. On the balance of probabilities, the fact that he sold his company for $10 million+ and amassed houses and luxury items and then died of a terminal illness (cancer?) indicates he was significantly older than you. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t really change anything but it might go some way to understanding his parent\u2019s behaviour outside of sheer greed.", "NTA!!!
