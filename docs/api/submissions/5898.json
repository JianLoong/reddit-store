He was your husband and he made a will laying out his wishes.  You are his primary heir and he wanted you to have his property.  Get a restraining order on his parents and get friends who are willing to support YOU.\n\nIf his parents just wanted a memento or two like a couple of his shirts, that's one thing, but this is obviously a cash grab from their dead child whom they did not approve of.

Those things are yours, by law, to do with as you please.

If they gave him a certain piece of furniture, I would probably give them that and what was already in the will. \n\nBUT\u2026.I would talk to a lawyer first before giving anything just in case it messes with what is stated in the will and not give the in-laws an opening to sue for more stuff.", "NTA.

Happy New Year.", "NTA\n\nYour husband made it clear what he wanted to go to you and what he wanted to go to his family by leaving a will. If you have a lawyer, talk to them and ask them to send a letter to his parents stating that they have already received what their son intended them to have and that they should cease and desist any and all contact regarding receiving any further property or possessions from his estate. They have no legal standing. \n\nFriends who do not support you in this are either afraid of conflict or are not your friends. Tell them that this is what your husband wanted and expressed in his will and it's how it's going to be and that's the end of the discussion. True friends will respect you on this. Lose the ones who don't. \n\nI'm very sorry for your loss and the extra stress your husband's family is placing on you. Stand strong.", "NTA. His parents raised your late husband as they should do given they are his parents. I have a feeling your husband would have left them more in his will if their support warranted it\u2014but you described them being unsupportive, not present when he was ill/dying, and also homophobic, so clearly not supportive of him, you, or your marriage. Meanwhile, you stood by your husband (and he by you). Don\u2019t feel guilty that he left you with everything of both financial and not mental value. Clearly, he wanted you to be set/secure and to take care of you.\n\nIf there is an item that is sentimental to them but not so much to you and you feel good about sharing it, then that\u2019s a nice gesture but not necessary. If there are childhood family photos and you can share copies, that\u2019s lovely. But don\u2019t feel obligated or guilted into such gestures. \n\nLastly, my condolences for your loss. I hope it brings comfort to know your husband is forever in your heart, sharing your love, and looking out for you in his way.", "NTA. If they were asking for some small items that have sentimental value to them and not really to you, that might be okay. But his money and house? Clearly they are trying to manipulate you for the sake of money. Because they made up some narrarive in their head that they deserve it more than you do. The worst kind of entitlement. Your husband *choose* to leave those things to *you* and you were his *husband*. Nobody should have these things but you.\n\nTell them to stop harrasing you and block them. If they keep bothering you, you can go to the police for harrasment. I would cut off those \"friends\" as well.", "NTA. Btw, you need new friends.", "NTA here.

It's one thing to ask for some sentimental items but it sounds like they want the money which he apparently did not want them to have.", "Block them all. You have a will.

When you said things, i thought you meants sentimental stuff, like things from when he was a kid.. but wanting a house and a watch collection? No, they don't want 'things' they see dollar signs.

It isn\u2019t clear if you met when you were both in middle school, or if only you were in middle school and he was older.

Unfortunately they are not the type of friends worth having. Rip the bandaid off now and be glad their true colors were revealed before they took advantage of you. Start new friendships and cut all contact to those people!", "NTA Do. Not. Give. Anything. To. Them.", "NTA. You need new friends, cause current ones suck.  \n\nVery sorry for the loss of your beloved.", "The answer above is correct. The great thing about your husband having had a will is that we actually know what he wanted to have happen with his stuff.", "Of course they do.  It's always the nicest stuff people want want \"for sentimental\" reasons.\n\nMy parent's estate will be a decent size.  No idea what share I will get, for various reasons (that aren't a bad relationship).  Mom has already passed, and of all their material possessions, all I want is a little statue of Dad that Mom commissioned for him.  For me, it's important.\n\nI want it because it has meaning to me, not because it is worth money.", "So very sorry for your loss. Since your husband left you with funds, perhaps hire a lawyer to be between you and his family. Have a lawyer send them all letters to not contact you directly and to only contact you through the lawyer. Follow up with restraining orders if they ignore that and keep bothering you directly. As to your friends that are berating you, I'd drop them, they\u2019re not your friends. Just keep the people who are supportive of you through this in your life. When you feel ready, which could be in a few years, if ever quite frankly, maybe look through your husbands belongings for something for each of his siblings and parents that you think will have sentimental resonance with them. I sent each sibling, cousin, BILs and close friends Hawaiian shirts about a year after my partner passed, he had an extensive collection of them. His family going after money, houses and valuable collectables isn't sentimental smh. And right now you're vulnerable. And they're behaving despicably, yes even his immediate family who are grief stricken as well, but not too grief stricken to try to swindle a vulnerable widow while she too is grieving.", "Clearly he was cutting ties with them. This reinforces that he didn\u2019t want them to have anything.", "I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nI would not be surprised AT ALL (based on your post and comments) if he put his parents in the will and gave them a small amount of money because it would give them zero grounds to contest it. They can\u2019t claim they were unintentionally left out of the will because they are named in it.", "OP like it's been said, if your husband wanted them to have it he would have written it in his will. He knew what they would try which is why he added them but gave them very litter so they couldn't contest it. He knew deep down what you would be battling and wanted to set you up to be comfortable. Your friends are not your friends if they are all against you. I've been in a similar position with some different things. You knew your husband and his wishes, don't ever feel ashamed or feel like it's a mistake to stay true to his wishes. If they were not around and made arrogant/homophobic comments, they do not deserve a damn thing! Stay true to your husband. I'm so sorry for your loss and having to go through this mess.", "I don't say this to be a dick, but FYI, 'bias' is a noun - a thing and not something people are. \n\n'Biased' is an adjective.\n\nPeople are biased or they 'hold a bias.'\n\nBut also, I concur with everyone else - your husband left you the stuff because that's how he wanted it. His parents get sod off.", "When my grandmother died all I wanted was her gold wedding band. Not her other diamond jewelry, just the plain gold band. It was so thin it was molded to the shape of her finger and was engraved with her wedding date. I still wear her band.", "OP should give them one of his husband's favorite t-shirts and a blanket he liked to snuggle under on chilly days. If they don't appreciate those items they don't want sentiment, they want lucre.", "I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nBut that doesn't mean OP should give his late husband's belongings (which are now his belongings) to the homophobic parents who turned their back on him while he was dying.", "My husband has his grandfather's pocket watch.  He cherishes it.  And sometimes even wears it. It has special meaning to his to remember a loved one.", "I'd love to see those figurines,  Is there a knickknack tax like reddit's pet tax? LOL", "<<festering buttboils>>  I love this!\n\n I  call bothersome people \"hemorrhoids\" with a descriptive/identifying adjective before it.  ie \"spray-tanned hemorrhoid\".\n\nI changed from calling people A-H's because at least an A-H has a useful function.  There is nothing useful about hemorrhoids.  They are just pain and misery", "I love language...and being creative with insults is so much more fun than  just saying AH or beyotch. most people are so shocked by a fully functioning vocabulary that they can't compose a response \ud83e\udd23"]}
