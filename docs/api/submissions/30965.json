My old country is very racist against a particular race and my parents hold those racist views. Back when we were engaged, my wife\u2019s best friend and maid of honor is this particular race. My parents didn\u2019t like that and didn\u2019t want any of our wedding photos to have her MOH in them. This led to a huge fight and a very awkward wedding after which my wife completely disowned my side of the family. \n\nWe eventually had 2 daughters and she refused to allow them to have anything to do with my side of the family. My parents have been to the US at least a dozen times to visit my siblings and other relatives but they\u2019ve never met my children. Although I understand my wife\u2019s position, I disagree with not allowing our children to know my side of the family but I\u2019ve honored her wish.\n\nI have a couple of siblings here but most live in the old country. Recently my niece from the old country asked if I could take her to visit some college campuses here and I said yes. I told my wife about my niece and her visit which led to a discussion about the enormous costs which further led to a discussion about how my sibling can cover the over $100,000 a year cost of tuition and living expenses for my niece.\n\nThe short version is that my parents are paying for it. They have many grandchildren and are going to pay for almost all of them to go to college because education is extremely important in my culture. I said almost all because they told me they\u2019re not paying for my children and will not include them in their will.\n\nI never told my wife any of that because I assumed she didn\u2019t care since she disowned my family and have had nothing to do with them. I was wrong, she cared. \n\nShe said it\u2019s unfair for our children to be left out which I agree but I can also see it from my parent\u2019s perspective. She wants me to have my parents include our children and even talked about suing. I reminded her that the legal system in the old country is not like the here where you can sue to be included in a will. Also, I feel dirty having to talk to my parents about giving our children money. This has led to her yelling at me for a couple of days and even now when I\u2019m posting this, she\u2019s text yelling at me about confronting my parents.\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks all for reading and giving me your input. It makes me feel better about my choice. There are things I left out because I was at my desk earlier but now I\u2019m at lunch so I\u2019ll include them.\n\nEven for US standards, most of my family would be considered very well off. They own factories in our old country that make parts or complete things for export to other countries. They also own other businesses and a considerable amount of land. All of which we\u2019re completely cut off from.\n\nI never told anyone I dated about my family\u2019s wealth because I wanted them to want me for me. I didn\u2019t tell me wife until after we were engaged but by that time she had it in her head that well off in my old country meant making minimum wage here. I tried to get her to visit my family before everything blew up but at first she didn\u2019t have a passport then she was too busy to get a passport then finally she didn\u2019t want to have \u201ca month of diarrhea\u201d. I remember her words exactly because it stung that she thought my old country was a 3rd world country.\n\nI regularly visit my siblings here and fly back to the old country at least once a year with her full knowledge.", "created_utc": 1699973794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17v3yua/aita_for_not_fighting_for_my_daughters_interests/", "score": 1277, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good riddance to bad money.", "NTA\n\nYour wife can't have it both ways.  \n\nIf you exclude them from you and your daughters' lives, you cannot expect their money.\n\nYour wife sounds totally unrealistic.", "NTA.  You and your wife should have been saving for your own daughters' college funds regardless. Nothing's changed.\n\nIf your parents have the kind of money to spend millions of dollars on grandchildren, then your wife has known about your family wealth from the beginning.  Surely she realized that cutting them off would mean potentially losing access to those funds.  It seems unreal that this would \"suddenly\" be an issue.", "NTA. It's funny how quickly some people's moral high ground just crumbles when money is on the line.", "NTA. Her choice to not let your kids have a relationship with your parents is the direct and full cause of this. If she hadn\u2019t decided to keep them from having a relationship your kids would be getting that money as well. Remind her of this and tell her that if she wants their money so badly she can call and ask them for it.", "NTA. You wanted to maintain a relationship with your parents, your wife didn't. It's not your wife's money, your money, or your child's money. It's your parent's money. Are your parents shitty for being racist? Yes. Does that make you entitled to their money? No. Losing out on the will is just the cost of virtue, and your wife has to accept that.", "NTA \n\nYou sound pretty saintly tbh, with patience and a great attitude to money. Your wife's principles would cost you, you probably knew it and committed anyway. Your wife is being a bit graceless over this, wish she had lived up to your expectations and not cared - I hope she comes around. \n\nDid your parents mellow much over the years? I guess reconciling is off the table now cos the money issue makes it seem suspect.", "Nta she *disowned* them. That means she wants nothing from them, including money.  She can't have it both ways.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand how people don't get that, never mind a \"right to an inheritance\", inheritance doesn't even actually EXIST until people die. Until your parents die, their money ISN'T an \"inheritance\" . . . it's just their money, that they have earned, and have a right to spend however they want, on whatever or whomever they want. No one except your parents has a right to it.\n\nAnd I totally understand why your wife is frustrated. She's caught between a rock and a hard place. Her choices are to allow openly and unapologetically racist grandparents into her children's lives, which it seems that even you, her own husband, don't see an issue with (and honestly, why don't you see an issue with your parents being abject racists . . . why do you want them to have an influence on your children?) . . . or to pass up incredible opportunities for her children's future simply because she stuck to what is ethically and morally right. That's a shitty position to be in. \n\nBut ultimately you are correct that your parents' money isn't something that you or your wife or kids have any right to. And your wife doesn't get to lay claim to it \"because family\" if she doesn't actually want to BE family with them. They aren't a bank, they are human beings . . . even if they're awful, proudly racist ones. And they don't owe anything to people who openly dislike them, family or not. NTA.", "So racists bad, but racists' money good?\n\nOP is NTA.", "NTA\n\nThe consequence of disowning your racist parents is that - well, you disown your racist parents.

Not having their money is a consequence of that.", "NTA.  Your parents are not obligated to pay for your kids.  You guys cut them off (and for good reason).  So why would they pay anything?  Your wife sounds greedy.  And sue them?  For what?  You\u2019re not owed anything.", "NTA. Your wife got exactly what she wanted; your parents are out of your lives.  And so is their money.

Drug kingpins, murderers, rapists, organized crime etc etc. But loaded out of their fucking minds. \n\nHe left it all behind, moved to the US for his education and had a long battle with his father about leaving the family and business behind. His children have no contact with his family. They live a upper middle class lifestyle, he's in banking now but nowhere near what his siblings kids' had, going to fancy private schools etc. But the flip side is they roll around with bodyguards in armored vehicles, and live in fear of the business spilling over into their family life. \n\nDoesn't have a single regret. His morals are worth more than all the gold plated pistols and private jets they could ever offer. He's also safe from them, because while he disowned his family, he didn't betray them.

Now, I completely understand her reasonings in doing this because your parent's are racist assholes. HOWEVER, your wife is nuts if she thinks that she can have this both ways. Basically, it's like your parent's don't have these grandchildren because they have never met them and your wife will not let them have anything to do with them. Why TF would they give money to people that they don't even know? I mean handing money to a stranger on the street would be about the same thing as them paying for your kids since they don't know them at all. NO ONE is promised anyone's money, but that is especially true when there is no relationship at all. Your wife needs a reality check.", "NTA - you can't have it both ways you're right.\n\n>This has led to her yelling at me for a couple of days and even now when I\u2019m posting this, she\u2019s text yelling at me about confronting my parents.\n\nI'd tell her you both decided to cut ties with them and this is one of the consequences. If she wants to ask them for money, she can do it herself, because you won't do that.", "NTA.   Your wife can't have her cake and eat it too.  She cut your parents out.  They haven't been allowed to meet your children yet she still thinks they are entitled to your parents' money?  Don't think so.

She doesn't get to tell them how to use their money - especially for children they've never even met.", "NTA, you\u2019re wife cannot have her cake and eat it too. \nThe right to inheritance is in most jurisdictions a right of the testator, not the heirs. Your children are brought up without their grandparents by your wife\u2019s wishes, not your parents. \nTo your wife, taking away part of their family from her children and to some degree also from you is well worth her principles. But now it\u2019s about money so it\u2019s different?\nI can understand why you don\u2019t want to talk to your parents about it. It would be a disgrace.", "NTA your wife decided she couldn't stand racists so why does she want to beg for their money now. \n\nIt's like all those posts about gay people needing to stay in the closet to grandpa in order to get large inheritances but feel the need to show grandpa that they don't care, except for after his death when they really do get nothing and start to beg for others to share their inheritance.", "She can hate their racism and treatment of her friend. She can even decide not to be involved with your family herself. The two of you, together, decided to keep the kids away from your side. It is absolutely unreasonable for her to expect her children to financially benefit from your family, who she disapproves of to the point of cutting them out of your lives! Who among us would give a ton of money to someone who openly hates us? Not many, if we\u2019re all honest. It would be so gross to reach out to your family for money now, after all that has happened. \n\nNTA", "NTA\nShe can't have her cake and eat it too. I think you need to stand up and say you're not doing it.  She has 2 choices.\n1) let your parents back in your lives and see if they change their mind, or\n2) continue as is and know you aren't owed anything from your parents", "So, just so you know, in the states, you can\u2019t sue parents to force them to write you into their will. That\u2019s a crazy, made up thing that your wife just said because she\u2019s mad about the situation. \n\nHaving integrity comes with making the hard choices. She cut them out of your lives, so she needs to live with the consequences of her actions, ie no money. \n\nOr she can decide that the money means more than her integrity, swallow her pride and allow them contact again - which may not work in any case since your parents 100% understand that she\u2019s just doing it for the money. \n\nThat said, cutting them off completely was perhaps not the wisest choice for your family, and now she sees the consequences. Just because they\u2019re racist or don\u2019t have the same values, doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t still be a part of your family. I have racist, misogynistic, homophobic and ignorant in-laws. If they say something awful, I\u2019ll call them out and after we spend time with them, I explain to my children that their grandparents aren\u2019t very smart people and we don\u2019t agree with their values. However, they\u2019re my husband\u2019s parents and while he understands that they\u2019re very flawed, he still gets to maintain a relationship with them. \n\nMaybe the real problem is that you were so quick to cave to her demands at the beginning without explaining the big picture to her.", "NTA.  Your wife disowned your side of the family, that includes their money.  Why the fuck would she expect your parents to leave an inheritance for children that they\u2019ve never even been allowed to meet?\n\nI understand why she chose to cut contact with racists, and I support that.  But she doesn\u2019t get to turn around and demand that the racists share their money with her.\n\nShe is free not to associate site your family if she doesn\u2019t want to, and your family is free to dispense with their assets however they choose.", "NTA.

My old country is very racist against a particular race and my parents hold those racist views. Back when we were engaged, my wife\u2019s best friend and maid of honor is this particular race. My parents didn\u2019t like that and didn\u2019t want any of our wedding photos to have her MOH in them. This led to a huge fight and a very awkward wedding after which my wife completely disowned my side of the family. \n\nWe eventually had 2 daughters and she refused to allow them to have anything to do with my side of the family. My parents have been to the US at least a dozen times to visit my siblings and other relatives but they\u2019ve never met my children. Although I understand my wife\u2019s position, I disagree with not allowing our children to know my side of the family but I\u2019ve honored her wish.\n\nI have a couple of siblings here but most live in the old country. Recently my niece from the old country asked if I could take her to visit some college campuses here and I said yes. I told my wife about my niece and her visit which led to a discussion about the enormous costs which further led to a discussion about how my sibling can cover the over $100,000 a year cost of tuition and living expenses for my niece.\n\nThe short version is that my parents are paying for it. They have many grandchildren and are going to pay for almost all of them to go to college because education is extremely important in my culture. I said almost all because they told me they\u2019re not paying for my children and will not include them in their will.\n\nI never told my wife any of that because I assumed she didn\u2019t care since she disowned my family and have had nothing to do with them. I was wrong, she cared. \n\nShe said it\u2019s unfair for our children to be left out which I agree but I can also see it from my parent\u2019s perspective. She wants me to have my parents include our children and even talked about suing. I reminded her that the legal system in the old country is not like the here where you can sue to be included in a will. Also, I feel dirty having to talk to my parents about giving our children money. This has led to her yelling at me for a couple of days and even now when I\u2019m posting this, she\u2019s text yelling at me about confronting my parents.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It also seems like if wifey knew there was money, she might\u2019ve kept up appearances.

In fact, she doesn\u2019t seem to want *any* sort of relationship; only their money.\n\nFair or not, your parents don\u2019t owe anyone anything. The idea of being entitled to an inheritance is, to me, the mark of a far too entitled person. Being related to someone doesn\u2019t mean you deserve to receive their property when they die. They can donate it to charity, pick and choose who gets it, or burn it all on the front lawn.

I'm going to skip over the irony of them valuing education and then being racist, so I digress. Your wife can't expect financial support for her children from people she refuses to allow see them.

You teach and guide them away from dangerous things like playing in the street or talking to strangers. You could also teach and guide them into believing that color and nationality do not matter. This is easy to do, specially with the limited visit time the parents would have with the kids due to distance. I mean, you don't keep the kids indoors until they are 18 to keep them \"safe\", and your family has bed beliefs, but are not violent.\n\nI am mad at your wife right now for denying you and the kids your whole side of the family. I am disappointed at you for allowing it! You have let your wife keep you and the kids away from your family for too long. \n\nForget about the college money. To ask for it now would be like saying you only want to see them for money. Even you have to agree the separation has hurt them enough. And I can tell you truly care about them. \n\nYou have lived with your wife making the rules long enough. It is time to start standing up for yourself, your kids, and your family. I would tell my wife I want my kids to know my parents. I want my parents to know my kids. There is nothing wrong with that. This is th US, where dad's do have a say in what goes on. \n\nYou can also look up ways to keep children from being influenced by racists. Get a game plan to ensure those beliefs do not transfer to your kids. Explain it to your wife. \n\nExplain also that you will not ask or address the tuition or inheritance issue. Let her know you need to rebuild this relationship without it being based on wants or needs. If she can't be genuine around your family, take the kids and leave her at home. She never has to spend a minute with your family if she chooses not to (only fair), but you are no longer going to deprive yourself or the kids of their company. \n\nEventually, you will need to see your family. Don't be at your dad's deathbed after 25 years of not seeing him,  regretting the amount of control you allowed your wife to have over your familial relationships.  I can tell you already regret the time you lost. \n\nRegardless of how much you love your wife, you are  slowly dying inside by this separation. It does benefit anything but your wife's sense of righteousness to stay away. She is hurting you and you are letting her. She has already hurt your kids, denied them a whole side of the family. \n\nIf she wants a divorce because you want time with your family, it is almost worth it. I would think what she is teaching them is as bad as racism:\n\n1) once someone upsets you, you should never forgive them, discuss it with them, or think they can learn to be better. Hate is the only option.\n\n2) family means nothing! \n\n3) it is okay to hate someone, but still feel entitled to what they have. If you want it, they should give it. \n\n4) only her opinion matters. Everyone else should listen to her. No. Questions. Asked.\n\n5) couples should not work together to get past their difficulties. They should just do what the wife wants, all husband's should buckle to the word of the wife\n\n6) it is okay to dislike or disown people if they do not agree with 100% of your opinions. \n\n7) it is okay to treat an entire family like piriahs because a few of the elders are prejudiced (in America, iT is common for the elders to be racists, and the younger to teach against it).\n\n8) it is all about you, don't consider others at all when making a decision about life's.\n\nI don't think you want your kids to grow up with those values, but you are allowing it. Do something about it. You are already arguing with your wife over this, take it all the way. You are as human as the rest of us. You have needs too. Your wife is not the Supreme Ruler of the Universe. If you don't put an end to this now, you will be at your dad's deathbed, as described earlier. \n\nDo you really want your wife so badly that you are willing to give up yourself for her? And you never know, if you stand up for your rights, she may agree you should see your family without her. \n\nBut whatever you do, I would make a new rule (because you can make rules about your OWN family) that she is never allowed to talk money, tuition,  or inheritance with your family.

Neither of you deserve that after diligently following the rule she set!!", "It makes sense that your wife was horrified at your family\u2019s racism. \n\nIt makes sense that you would side with your wife on this, even though I imagine your history with your family made it difficult to disown them, despite their obvious and objectively terrible flaws. \n\nIt makes sense that your family is extremely offended that they aren\u2019t allowed contact with their grandchildren.\n\nAnd it makes sense that because they cannot even meet your children, they will not be giving them money.

He apologized and said he could keep his trap shut. My kids were exposed to those ugly words, but they also saw me stand up to him and make him apologize. After he left, I would talk to the kids about how ignorance leads to racism. If I had told my spouse that FIL would never be welcome in our house, the kids would not have had that example.

She would laugh at me and say no they aren't, they pass for white so they are white.   I eventually cut her off for other reasons, she was just all around toxic and dangerous. It's harder to divert dangerous behavior and exhausting.  And it wasn't even like I kept her around for money, nope just a sick twisted sense of obligation, guilt, and that I owed it to her for being such a crappy child.

That\u2019s why in the US there are much publicized cases of people being mentioned in wills and trusts as being excluded. Because without said legal notification they are legally presumed to be entitled, and sometimes, dependent on probate laws of residence, they are also presumed included if the notification of exclusion is determined to be fraudulently included, improperly framed, or simply unjustified given circumstances.
