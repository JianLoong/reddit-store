My old country is very racist against a particular race and my parents hold those racist views. Back when we were engaged, my wife\u2019s best friend and maid of honor is this particular race. My parents didn\u2019t like that and didn\u2019t want any of our wedding photos to have her MOH in them. This led to a huge fight and a very awkward wedding after which my wife completely disowned my side of the family. \n\nWe eventually had 2 daughters and she refused to allow them to have anything to do with my side of the family. My parents have been to the US at least a dozen times to visit my siblings and other relatives but they\u2019ve never met my children. Although I understand my wife\u2019s position, I disagree with not allowing our children to know my side of the family but I\u2019ve honored her wish.\n\nI have a couple of siblings here but most live in the old country. Recently my niece from the old country asked if I could take her to visit some college campuses here and I said yes. I told my wife about my niece and her visit which led to a discussion about the enormous costs which further led to a discussion about how my sibling can cover the over $100,000 a year cost of tuition and living expenses for my niece.\n\nThe short version is that my parents are paying for it. They have many grandchildren and are going to pay for almost all of them to go to college because education is extremely important in my culture. I said almost all because they told me they\u2019re not paying for my children and will not include them in their will.\n\nI never told my wife any of that because I assumed she didn\u2019t care since she disowned my family and have had nothing to do with them. I was wrong, she cared. \n\nShe said it\u2019s unfair for our children to be left out which I agree but I can also see it from my parent\u2019s perspective. She wants me to have my parents include our children and even talked about suing. I reminded her that the legal system in the old country is not like the here where you can sue to be included in a will. Also, I feel dirty having to talk to my parents about giving our children money. This has led to her yelling at me for a couple of days and even now when I\u2019m posting this, she\u2019s text yelling at me about confronting my parents.", "created_utc": 1699973794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17v3yua/aita_for_not_fighting_for_my_daughters_interests/", "score": 345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your wife have excluded all contact with your side of the family in your kids.  You and your wife made that choice.  So no, they don't owe your kids jack or squat.\n\n\"She said it\u2019s unfair for our children to be left out...\"\n\nSorry, but this is BS.  While you were right to push back on their racists  comments concerning her MOH, this is the cost of that choice.", "NTA she can\u2019t have it both ways where she disowns your family, prevents your parents from having a relationship with your daughters, but still expects & demands their money. Cutting them off means cutting off their wallet. \n\nFrankly, it\u2019s for the better as it prevents them from using their money to demand compliance with their views and values.  Good riddance to bad money.", "NTA\n\nYour wife can't have it both ways.  \n\nIf you exclude them from you and your daughters' lives, you cannot expect their money.\n\nYour wife sounds totally unrealistic.", "NTA.  You and your wife should have been saving for your own daughters' college funds regardless. Nothing's changed.\n\nIf your parents have the kind of money to spend millions of dollars on grandchildren, then your wife has known about your family wealth from the beginning.  Surely she realized that cutting them off would mean potentially losing access to those funds.  It seems unreal that this would \"suddenly\" be an issue.", "NTA. It's funny how quickly some people's moral high ground just crumbles when money is on the line.", "NTA. Her choice to not let your kids have a relationship with your parents is the direct and full cause of this. If she hadn\u2019t decided to keep them from having a relationship your kids would be getting that money as well. Remind her of this and tell her that if she wants their money so badly she can call and ask them for it.", "NTA. You wanted to maintain a relationship with your parents, your wife didn't. It's not your wife's money, your money, or your child's money. It's your parent's money. Are your parents shitty for being racist? Yes. Does that make you entitled to their money? No. Losing out on the will is just the cost of virtue, and your wife has to accept that.", "NTA \n\nYou sound pretty saintly tbh, with patience and a great attitude to money. Your wife's principles would cost you, you probably knew it and committed anyway. Your wife is being a bit graceless over this, wish she had lived up to your expectations and not cared - I hope she comes around. \n\nDid your parents mellow much over the years? I guess reconciling is off the table now cos the money issue makes it seem suspect.", "Nta she *disowned* them. That means she wants nothing from them, including money.  She can't have it both ways.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand how people don't get that, never mind a \"right to an inheritance\", inheritance doesn't even actually EXIST until people die. Until your parents die, their money ISN'T an \"inheritance\" . . . it's just their money, that they have earned, and have a right to spend however they want, on whatever or whomever they want. No one except your parents has a right to it.\n\nAnd I totally understand why your wife is frustrated. She's caught between a rock and a hard place. Her choices are to allow openly and unapologetically racist grandparents into her children's lives, which it seems that even you, her own husband, don't see an issue with (and honestly, why don't you see an issue with your parents being abject racists . . . why do you want them to have an influence on your children?) . . . or to pass up incredible opportunities for her children's future simply because she stuck to what is ethically and morally right. That's a shitty position to be in. \n\nBut ultimately you are correct that your parents' money isn't something that you or your wife or kids have any right to. And your wife doesn't get to lay claim to it \"because family\" if she doesn't actually want to BE family with them. They aren't a bank, they are human beings . . . even if they're awful, proudly racist ones. And they don't owe anything to people who openly dislike them, family or not. NTA.", "So racists bad, but racists' money good?\n\nOP is NTA.", "NTA\n\nThe consequence of disowning your racist parents is that - well, you disown your racist parents. You can't tell them you want nothing to do with them, and they don't get to see your children because they're racists, and then turn round and say \"but we want your money\".\n\nYour children don't have a relationship with your parents. Not having their money is a consequence of that.", "NTA.  Your parents are not obligated to pay for your kids.  You guys cut them off (and for good reason).  So why would they pay anything?  Your wife sounds greedy.  And sue them?  For what?  You\u2019re not owed anything.", "NTA. Your wife got exactly what she wanted; your parents are out of your lives.  And so is their money. She can\u2019t have her cake and eat it too.", "I've got a friend from University. His family is the worst kind of people. Drug kingpins, murderers, rapists, organized crime etc etc. But loaded out of their fucking minds. \n\nHe left it all behind, moved to the US for his education and had a long battle with his father about leaving the family and business behind. His children have no contact with his family. They live a upper middle class lifestyle, he's in banking now but nowhere near what his siblings kids' had, going to fancy private schools etc. But the flip side is they roll around with bodyguards in armored vehicles, and live in fear of the business spilling over into their family life. \n\nDoesn't have a single regret. His morals are worth more than all the gold plated pistols and private jets they could ever offer. He's also safe from them, because while he disowned his family, he didn't betray them. But as Latin Americans, where a huge emphasis is placed on family, it was a sharp blow to do so. \n\nNTA, you can't buy integrity.", "You wife can't have it both ways.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife can\u2019t have it both ways. She can\u2019t refuse to have your family in her and your children\u2019s life, which I actually agree with since growing up around racism isn\u2019t worth the hassle of keeping the peace, but then turn around and demand their money.", "NTA - Your wife wanted to disown your parents and not have them see their grandchildren. Now, I completely understand her reasonings in doing this because your parent's are racist assholes. HOWEVER, your wife is nuts if she thinks that she can have this both ways. Basically, it's like your parent's don't have these grandchildren because they have never met them and your wife will not let them have anything to do with them. Why TF would they give money to people that they don't even know? I mean handing money to a stranger on the street would be about the same thing as them paying for your kids since they don't know them at all. NO ONE is promised anyone's money, but that is especially true when there is no relationship at all. Your wife needs a reality check.", "NTA - you can't have it both ways you're right.\n\n>This has led to her yelling at me for a couple of days and even now when I\u2019m posting this, she\u2019s text yelling at me about confronting my parents.\n\nI'd tell her you both decided to cut ties with them and this is one of the consequences. If she wants to ask them for money, she can do it herself, because you won't do that.", "NTA.   Your wife can't have her cake and eat it too.  She cut your parents out.  They haven't been allowed to meet your children yet she still thinks they are entitled to your parents' money?  Don't think so.  Whether her reasons for cutting them out are valid or not, she is certainly not entitled to demand they leave your children anything.  She doesn't get to tell them how to use their money - especially for children they've never even met.", "NTA, you\u2019re wife cannot have her cake and eat it too. \nThe right to inheritance is in most jurisdictions a right of the testator, not the heirs. Your children are brought up without their grandparents by your wife\u2019s wishes, not your parents. \nTo your wife, taking away part of their family from her children and to some degree also from you is well worth her principles. But now it\u2019s about money so it\u2019s different?\nI can understand why you don\u2019t want to talk to your parents about it. It would be a disgrace.", "NTA your wife decided she couldn't stand racists so why does she want to beg for their money now. \n\nIt's like all those posts about gay people needing to stay in the closet to grandpa in order to get large inheritances but feel the need to show grandpa that they don't care, except for after his death when they really do get nothing and start to beg for others to share their inheritance.", "She can hate their racism and treatment of her friend. She can even decide not to be involved with your family herself. The two of you, together, decided to keep the kids away from your side. It is absolutely unreasonable for her to expect her children to financially benefit from your family, who she disapproves of to the point of cutting them out of your lives! Who among us would give a ton of money to someone who openly hates us? Not many, if we\u2019re all honest. It would be so gross to reach out to your family for money now, after all that has happened. \n\nNTA", "NTA\nShe can't have her cake and eat it too. I think you need to stand up and say you're not doing it.  She has 2 choices.\n1) let your parents back in your lives and see if they change their mind, or\n2) continue as is and know you aren't owed anything from your parents", "So, just so you know, in the states, you can\u2019t sue parents to force them to write you into their will. That\u2019s a crazy, made up thing that your wife just said because she\u2019s mad about the situation. \n\nHaving integrity comes with making the hard choices. She cut them out of your lives, so she needs to live with the consequences of her actions, ie no money. \n\nOr she can decide that the money means more than her integrity, swallow her pride and allow them contact again - which may not work in any case since your parents 100% understand that she\u2019s just doing it for the money. \n\nThat said, cutting them off completely was perhaps not the wisest choice for your family, and now she sees the consequences. Just because they\u2019re racist or don\u2019t have the same values, doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t still be a part of your family. I have racist, misogynistic, homophobic and ignorant in-laws. If they say something awful, I\u2019ll call them out and after we spend time with them, I explain to my children that their grandparents aren\u2019t very smart people and we don\u2019t agree with their values. However, they\u2019re my husband\u2019s parents and while he understands that they\u2019re very flawed, he still gets to maintain a relationship with them. \n\nMaybe the real problem is that you were so quick to cave to her demands at the beginning without explaining the big picture to her.", "NTA.  Your wife disowned your side of the family, that includes their money.  Why the fuck would she expect your parents to leave an inheritance for children that they\u2019ve never even been allowed to meet?\n\nI understand why she chose to cut contact with racists, and I support that.  But she doesn\u2019t get to turn around and demand that the racists share their money with her.\n\nShe is free not to associate site your family if she doesn\u2019t want to, and your family is free to dispense with their assets however they choose.", "NTA. You guys made a choice to cut out bigots. And can NOT be surprised they chose not to include you in anything financial they provide for other family members who accept their bigotry.", "If she doesn't want to associate with racists, she doesn't get to demand racist money. OP is NTA if he does not confront his parents about this.", "Can you sue in the US to be included in a Will??? That's news to me. Whatever. You should have tried to encourage a bond between your children and your parents. I am not getting why you have been so submissive to your wife's demands and views. It's kind of funny but no surprise that now that she knows there's lots of money to be had that she's reacting. No idea of who the AH is here to be honest.", "NTA. Can\u2019t have it both ways. Stand your ground. Don\u2019t ask your parents for the money. Your wife is being entitled here.", "NTA. She can\u2019t have it both ways.

And even if there was, she would have to sue in their country, not the US as the parents aren't US citizens and don't live in the US.", "This all makes your wife look bad. She was right to cut them off for being racists; but now she just looks greedy. NTA", "You can't disown your in-laws and then expect money from them to pay for your children's college.

You can't cut someone out of your life and then demand money from them. She needs to grow up.", "You are NTA but your wife is. So are your parents but not because of the money. They were completely out of line at your wedding. They should have kept their racist views to themselves and not made their demand about the photos. But your wife is essentially demanding that your parents give money to strangers. They don\u2019t know your kids because their mother has refused to allow them to even meet their grandchildren. If it\u2019s because she\u2019s still angry about the wedding then she needs to deal with it, not ignore them. If it\u2019s because she\u2019s concerned that your parents will pass on their racist views then I understand why she would be concerned. But she could still allow them to see the kids and just monitor their behavior. If she intends to keep your kids from ever meeting your parents then this is a consequence of her decision and she will have to accept it. Threatening to sue for something she has no right to is idiotic. Your wife needs to grow up.", "LOL, so your wife wants their money but not a relationship\u2026yeah sorry, doesn\u2019t work like that.

My old country is very racist against a particular race and my parents hold those racist views. Back when we were engaged, my wife\u2019s best friend and maid of honor is this particular race. My parents didn\u2019t like that and didn\u2019t want any of our wedding photos to have her MOH in them. This led to a huge fight and a very awkward wedding after which my wife completely disowned my side of the family. \n\nWe eventually had 2 daughters and she refused to allow them to have anything to do with my side of the family. My parents have been to the US at least a dozen times to visit my siblings and other relatives but they\u2019ve never met my children. Although I understand my wife\u2019s position, I disagree with not allowing our children to know my side of the family but I\u2019ve honored her wish.\n\nI have a couple of siblings here but most live in the old country. Recently my niece from the old country asked if I could take her to visit some college campuses here and I said yes. I told my wife about my niece and her visit which led to a discussion about the enormous costs which further led to a discussion about how my sibling can cover the over $100,000 a year cost of tuition and living expenses for my niece.\n\nThe short version is that my parents are paying for it. They have many grandchildren and are going to pay for almost all of them to go to college because education is extremely important in my culture. I said almost all because they told me they\u2019re not paying for my children and will not include them in their will.\n\nI never told my wife any of that because I assumed she didn\u2019t care since she disowned my family and have had nothing to do with them. I was wrong, she cared. \n\nShe said it\u2019s unfair for our children to be left out which I agree but I can also see it from my parent\u2019s perspective. She wants me to have my parents include our children and even talked about suing. I reminded her that the legal system in the old country is not like the here where you can sue to be included in a will. Also, I feel dirty having to talk to my parents about giving our children money. This has led to her yelling at me for a couple of days and even now when I\u2019m posting this, she\u2019s text yelling at me about confronting my parents.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When are you gonna ask how all this makes ME FEEL?\u201d\n\nETA - I do think it was right for wife to take a stand for her MOH, and while she may be in the right for that, and you were right to stand by her, yoi both had to know it was going to come with consequences. It also seems like the decision wasn\u2019t one made together, but more wifey putting her foot down, which doesn\u2019t sit well with me. It also seems like if wifey knew there was money, she might\u2019ve kept up appearances. So even though she was correct in the initial conflict, it doesn\u2019t make her right on all things tangentially related to that conflict. None of this is a good look for her, especially now that she is demanding YOU do something to fix the mess SHE made.", "NTA.  Your wife is sounding like a greedy wretch.

You cannot and should not expect to profit from them afterwards.", "NTA - There is no legal requirement for anything to be fair in a will.  Your parents can spend their own money however they want.  As others have said, this reflects really poorly on your wife to be asking for money after disowning your side of the family.  I feel she was totally justified disowning them, but no takebacksies.

What an asshole.", "NTA.  You cut someone out of your life (and rightly so), you don't get any of their money.  Also, fyi, you can't sue to be included in a will in the US either.

Spouses may be able to sue after someone has died to obtain their spousal share if they've been written out of a will, but that's about it.", "ESH. You for still being in contact with racists who can't even put their twisted believes aside for their sons wedding. And your wife for her hypocrisy. So your parents/family are too racist to have contact to your children but taking their money is okay?\n\nAnd obviously your parents/family suck for being racist.", "NTA for your part. You wife made the decision, which you supported, to cut your side of the family out of your lives and the lives of your children. The reason for this decision is irrelevant.

In fact, she doesn\u2019t seem to want *any* sort of relationship; only their money.\n\nFair or not, your parents don\u2019t owe anyone anything. The idea of being entitled to an inheritance is, to me, the mark of a far too entitled person. Being related to someone doesn\u2019t mean you deserve to receive their property when they die. They can donate it to charity, pick and choose who gets it, or burn it all on the front lawn.

This is pure greed, if she was sticking to her principles she wouldn't want money from racists anyway, what's the issue?", "You're NTA, but your parents and wife are. I'm going to skip over the irony of them valuing education and then being racist, so I digress. Your wife can't expect financial support for her children from people she refuses to allow see them. I also understand why she wouldn't want such racist people around her children. I wouldn't want my kids interacting with racists and rubbing off on them. She's still completely ignorant in demanding money for them. It's selfish and rediculous.", "NTA - she's a hypocrite. She did the right thing disowning racists, but she can't expect their money.
