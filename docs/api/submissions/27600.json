No. No you're not.", "NTA. Coming out is something that ought to happen at the time and place of one\u2019s choosing.  This includes not telling folks as well. Others dreams for you are not your responsibility to make reality.\n\nFinally, I hope things calm down and that you have a place to feel safe and supported.", "NTA.  It's shocking and disappointing that this is still happening in 2023.  \n\nYour sexuality (and any other thoughts or feelings that you want to keep to yourself) is not public property.  No one has any right to know your sexuality.  If you want to share information, go ahead.  But you certainly don't have to.  Anyway, your parents' reaction is a shining example of why you DON'T feel comfortable sharing information with them.\n\nI would tell your uncle that he is a gigantic AH for creating this chaos and then cut him off.  \n\nTell your father that his comment was unbelievable.  You can't change your sexuality to suit your mother and you don't owe her a particular lifestyle.  Many straight people don't have children and there are ways for gay people to have children.  The bottom line is that if your mother wanted to guarantee she'd get grandchildren, she should have had more children of her own to increase her chances.  \n\n No matter what happens, stay calm.  Next time your parents bring this up, tell them that you'll remember their reaction for the rest of their life and that if they want a relationship with you in future, they need to apologize for their behavior and talk to a counselor about how to behave in future.  I repeat: your sexuality is none of their business unless you choose to make it their business.  You don't have to share any information you don't want to and you're doing nothing wrong by being who you are.\n\nAnother thing I think you should do is go to your doctor or school counselor and ask about resources for kids in your situation.  If your parents kick you out or refuse to pay your college tuition or continue to yell at you, then you can get help from various organizations.  Please make a list of them and their phone numbers/emails right now so that you know what to do if anything happens.  I hope your parents will calm down, but if they don't, you need to know exactly where to go and what to do.  Good luck.", "NTA. NTA 2. NTA 3. NTA Vice City.

You need a place to live and it can be rough getting kicked out at an early age. There are people who are just set in their ways. They will never attempt to understand a different perspective. You can't reason with someone who doesn't want to be reasoned with. You just have to find ways to deal with having them in your life. Honestly the healthiest thing to do in many cases with family is set boundaries and lie until you can get out.", "NTA. You had good reason not to tell them given their reaction.

You have the right to come out whenever you want to whomever you want. Your parents\u2019 reaction demonstrates exactly why.

You totally had the right to tell them on your own schedule. Their reaction to finding out confirms your instinct to not tell them. Screaming is definitely not an appropriate response.", "NTA. They have no right to demand you share anything with them, let alone your sexuality.

I\u2019m so sorry they weren\u2019t accepting and supportive.\n\nYour parents (and family, sounds like) are homophobic. They aren\u2019t angry you didn\u2019t tell them, they\u2019re angry you aren\u2019t straight.

Because my son came out to ME, and it's never ANYONE'S place to out someone else. Ever. \n\nYou're mom being upset about you \"not getting married and having kids\" is stupid, gay people get married. Gay people have kids. They adopt, surrogate, etc, but they have kids all the time. Sorry but your mom sounds like really backwards and sheltered and a little bit dumb saying that.\n\nOP, you are the only NTA in this situation. The whole rest of your family are being TA. Do you have a friend group or some elder LGBTQ+ people you can lean on? Most of us end up having to make our own \"family\" and it's really important for you to have a support system that loves and accepts you. Is there a gay-straight alliance at your place of education, or at a local drop in? Somewhere you can find a safe community.", "NTA, yikes even a very big NTA. \n\nThat is the kind of thing you never talk to you uncle again over, what an massive asshole and a tool. \n\nYou can still get married and have kids even though your gay, or at least I hope so depending on where you live so Mom will get over it. Hopefully they are just shocked from the sudden news and will calm down, if they dont then its on them. \n\nHeck I'm straight and I'm still not planning on having kids or getting married so dont sweat it since your sexuality has nothing to do with that. \n\nAgain seriously fuck your uncle though, outing you like that made a often difficult situation so so much worse.", "Nah, you're not the asshole. Your family is just being a bunch of closed-minded jerks. You don't owe them an explanation for your sexuality and it's not your fault that they can't handle it. Just focus on finding support from people who actually accept you for who you are.", "NTA and you have no reason to apologize. They are all being homophobic and discriminatory. Is the whole family up in arms when your straight cousin dates for the first time? No, no one gives a shit. Don't apologize to anyone, they should apologize to you.", "NTA, obviously.  But I'm stuck on this point about them being angry at you for 'letting them think you were straight all this time' and 'getting everyone's hopes up about marriage and kids'?!?  Dude you are 16!  You weren't 36 and continuously making up fake girlfriends to throw them off your track.  It's great that you figured out who you are so young, but many people don't figure out their sexuality until their late teens or older.

You deserve support! \n\nYou do not have to tell ANYONE who you like, who you're attracted to, who you want to kiss, who you're dating, or if you have plans for a family or not. That is YOUR PRIVATE INFO. \n\nEven if you were bi or straight, there is NO GUARANTEE you'd get married and produce offspring for your parents. Your parents are cruel for putting that expectation on you. Likewise, gay couples can and do get married and have children. That's YOUR choice and you don't have to tell anyone. \n\nYou don't need to apologize for being gay, any more than your family needs to apologize for being straight! but your family SHOULD apologize for not accepting you as you are.

There\u2019s some advice here about pushing back against your parents but I urge you to be cautious and think about what risks this might pose with your parents specifically. Are they likely to kick you out, cut you off financially or ship you off to conversion therapy?\n\nMake the choices you need to make and tell the lies you need to tell to keep a roof over your head. I suggest you start seriously planning for what you\u2019ll do if they do decide to cut you off, either now or when you turn 18. Do you have even a single family member who supports you? Any friends parents? Are you in a part of the world where you can tell a school counselor that you\u2019ve been outed to your parents and they\u2019re not taking it well and they will help you? I\u2019d look into a part time job to try and save up as much as you can and look at options for after high school like trade school where you can gain the skills to make a good living, even if your parents don\u2019t support you in that.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a big and beautiful world out here of us gays.

Your parents are shitty and are supposed to love you unconditionally. Why are they so disgusting towards not accepting a family member\u2019s (your) happiness?

There are tons of us who support you so please don\u2019t let your family get you too down. I\u2019m glad that when you weren\u2019t sure if you were being bad, you asked and let us tell you that you aren\u2019t. Stay strong! Find supportive people near you. I hope your family realizes their close minded mistake and makes it up to you before you move out!", "Sweetie it\u2019s your life and you should be happy.  I\u2019m sorry you have a horrible family!  Don\u2019t feel like you let your mom down because you\u2019re not going to have babies.  Who knows maybe you\u2019ll adopt someday and if not so what.  Live your life the way you want.", "NTA, their reaction is exactly why so many people have trouble coming out. Also, do not apologize, you have nothing to apologize for.", "NTA. It sounds like that was a choice made out of self-preservation; I'm so sorry to hear your family is treating you this way", "\u201cYour reaction is exactly why I didn\u2019t tell you. Maybe I would have come out sooner if I had a family I knew would support me\u201d \n\nObviously don\u2019t say that but like..that\u2019s exactly how I wish these kinda situations could go. \n\nNta. Sorry things are tough for you right now. It sucks not having a supportive family", "NTA. Your sexuality is your own business not anyone else's. No one is entitled to know that. If anything they've just proven your concerns to be correct. \n\nI'm sorry this happened. You're family don't sound very nice and your uncle sounds like a right AH himself.", "all I could think after reading this post was \"well this is exactly why they didn't tell you.\" usually gay people don't tend to tell homophobic people they're gay because of issues like this", ">My dad said I really upset my mom because she expected me to get married and have kids and I got her and everyone else's hopes up.\n\nAlso want to point out that.\n\n1. Gay people also get married.\n2. Straight people don't always have kids OR get married.\n3. Marriage and kids are for yourself, not them.", "thank you <33", ">Another thing I think you should do is go to your doctor or school counselor and ask about resources for kids in your situation. \n\nDepending on where they're located.  There are a number of places that are not friendly at all to LGBTQ+ kids (and I'm including some states in the US in that).", "okay thank you sm", "Better tell them absolutely everything about yourself just in case you're still ah for not telling them everything. Then your parents need to tell you everything no matter how small", "Yes, all this. If there isn't anyone local you feel safe talking to, there are national organizations for gay kids. I'm a mom of a gay teen, and I'm so, so sorry OP. You deserve so much better.", "Also NTA Tokyo Drift.", "LMAO, I wasn't expecting a response like this in an AITA post.", "haha thank you", "Chef's kiss \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffb", "okay thank you\n\nAnd mainly said sorry because I made them upset I just thought they'd stoo being uspet if I said sorry", "That's not true. What about if you're in a relationship lying about your sexuality? I get it's hard but it's an awful thing to do to someone.", "thank you!", "thank you <3", "Yea....no. Queer people (especially ones with homophobic families) don't owe anyone by telling them. Their reaction isn't because they're shocked, it's because they're homophobic.", "\"Idk if AH is the right terminology, but as a minor your parents DO have the right to know certain things about you.\"\n\nYep. Their sexuality is not one of them though.\n\n\"As we live in a society where sexual orientation overrules personality traits, one could argue that it\u2019s a pretty big deal they didn\u2019t know.\"\n\nOverrule personality traits? What does that even mean? Are you one of those people who thinks personality is linked to sexuality or something? \n\n\"I think their reaction is based more on how they found out than anything.\"\n\nDoesn't matter how they found out, they're homophobic nonetheless which makes them massive assholes.", "Who you tell and don\u2019t tell your sexuality to is up to the person, not the creeping uncle who didn\u2019t have the common courtesy to not spread it like wildfire.", "thank you and no he is my age dw", "ty <33", "aw man I'm really sorry try not to be too worried it might go really well!!", "thank you :')", "thank you :]", "thanks man", "I think she more expected me to get a wife and have a kid with her like a bio one", "thank you sm :] <3", "thank you so so much <333", "thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "4. Any couple can have kids now", "They're 16. Burning bridges can come later when they have the means to support themselves.", "The only one reason they could be upset as a parents could be the situation, where the AH uncle told them about you kissing and they didn't know about you being gay. They could feel awkward and not very good parents, not knowing this about you and hearing it from the third party.  \nBut them being upset doesn't mean they are right and you have an obligation to tell them about it.   \nNTA", "And this guys family while not seeming super homophobic definitely seems a little bit \u201cI\u2019m going to be annoyed if my children aren\u2019t straight\u201d. Your sexuality is something you should keep to yourself, you don\u2019t have to tell anyone."]}
