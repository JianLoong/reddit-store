No. No you're not.", "NTA. Coming out is something that ought to happen at the time and place of one\u2019s choosing.  This includes not telling folks as well. Others dreams for you are not your responsibility to make reality.\n\nFinally, I hope things calm down and that you have a place to feel safe and supported.", "NTA.  It's shocking and disappointing that this is still happening in 2023.  \n\nYour sexuality (and any other thoughts or feelings that you want to keep to yourself) is not public property.  No one has any right to know your sexuality.  If you want to share information, go ahead.  But you certainly don't have to.  Anyway, your parents' reaction is a shining example of why you DON'T feel comfortable sharing information with them.\n\nI would tell your uncle that he is a gigantic AH for creating this chaos and then cut him off.  \n\nTell your father that his comment was unbelievable.  You can't change your sexuality to suit your mother and you don't owe her a particular lifestyle.  Many straight people don't have children and there are ways for gay people to have children.  The bottom line is that if your mother wanted to guarantee she'd get grandchildren, she should have had more children of her own to increase her chances.  \n\n No matter what happens, stay calm.  Next time your parents bring this up, tell them that you'll remember their reaction for the rest of their life and that if they want a relationship with you in future, they need to apologize for their behavior and talk to a counselor about how to behave in future.  I repeat: your sexuality is none of their business unless you choose to make it their business.  You don't have to share any information you don't want to and you're doing nothing wrong by being who you are.\n\nAnother thing I think you should do is go to your doctor or school counselor and ask about resources for kids in your situation.  If your parents kick you out or refuse to pay your college tuition or continue to yell at you, then you can get help from various organizations.  Please make a list of them and their phone numbers/emails right now so that you know what to do if anything happens.  I hope your parents will calm down, but if they don't, you need to know exactly where to go and what to do.  Good luck.", "NTA. NTA 2. NTA 3. NTA Vice City.

You need a place to live and it can be rough getting kicked out at an early age. There are people who are just set in their ways. They will never attempt to understand a different perspective. You can't reason with someone who doesn't want to be reasoned with. You just have to find ways to deal with having them in your life. Honestly the healthiest thing to do in many cases with family is set boundaries and lie until you can get out.", "NTA. You had good reason not to tell them given their reaction.

You have the right to come out whenever you want to whomever you want. Your parents\u2019 reaction demonstrates exactly why.

You totally had the right to tell them on your own schedule. Their reaction to finding out confirms your instinct to not tell them. Screaming is definitely not an appropriate response.", "NTA. They have no right to demand you share anything with them, let alone your sexuality.

I\u2019m so sorry they weren\u2019t accepting and supportive.\n\nYour parents (and family, sounds like) are homophobic. They aren\u2019t angry you didn\u2019t tell them, they\u2019re angry you aren\u2019t straight.

Because my son came out to ME, and it's never ANYONE'S place to out someone else. Ever. \n\nYou're mom being upset about you \"not getting married and having kids\" is stupid, gay people get married. Gay people have kids. They adopt, surrogate, etc, but they have kids all the time. Sorry but your mom sounds like really backwards and sheltered and a little bit dumb saying that.\n\nOP, you are the only NTA in this situation. The whole rest of your family are being TA. Do you have a friend group or some elder LGBTQ+ people you can lean on? Most of us end up having to make our own \"family\" and it's really important for you to have a support system that loves and accepts you. Is there a gay-straight alliance at your place of education, or at a local drop in? Somewhere you can find a safe community.", "NTA, yikes even a very big NTA. \n\nThat is the kind of thing you never talk to you uncle again over, what an massive asshole and a tool. \n\nYou can still get married and have kids even though your gay, or at least I hope so depending on where you live so Mom will get over it. Hopefully they are just shocked from the sudden news and will calm down, if they dont then its on them. \n\nHeck I'm straight and I'm still not planning on having kids or getting married so dont sweat it since your sexuality has nothing to do with that. \n\nAgain seriously fuck your uncle though, outing you like that made a often difficult situation so so much worse.", "Nah, you're not the asshole. Your family is just being a bunch of closed-minded jerks. You don't owe them an explanation for your sexuality and it's not your fault that they can't handle it. Just focus on finding support from people who actually accept you for who you are.", "NTA and you have no reason to apologize. They are all being homophobic and discriminatory.

But I'm stuck on this point about them being angry at you for 'letting them think you were straight all this time' and 'getting everyone's hopes up about marriage and kids'?!?  Dude you are 16!  You weren't 36 and continuously making up fake girlfriends to throw them off your track.  It's great that you figured out who you are so young, but many people don't figure out their sexuality until their late teens or older.

You deserve support! \n\nYou do not have to tell ANYONE who you like, who you're attracted to, who you want to kiss, who you're dating, or if you have plans for a family or not. That is YOUR PRIVATE INFO. \n\nEven if you were bi or straight, there is NO GUARANTEE you'd get married and produce offspring for your parents. Your parents are cruel for putting that expectation on you. Likewise, gay couples can and do get married and have children. That's YOUR choice and you don't have to tell anyone. \n\nYou don't need to apologize for being gay, any more than your family needs to apologize for being straight! but your family SHOULD apologize for not accepting you as you are.

There\u2019s some advice here about pushing back against your parents but I urge you to be cautious and think about what risks this might pose with your parents specifically. Are they likely to kick you out, cut you off financially or ship you off to conversion therapy?\n\nMake the choices you need to make and tell the lies you need to tell to keep a roof over your head. I suggest you start seriously planning for what you\u2019ll do if they do decide to cut you off, either now or when you turn 18. Do you have even a single family member who supports you? Any friends parents? Are you in a part of the world where you can tell a school counselor that you\u2019ve been outed to your parents and they\u2019re not taking it well and they will help you? I\u2019d look into a part time job to try and save up as much as you can and look at options for after high school like trade school where you can gain the skills to make a good living, even if your parents don\u2019t support you in that.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a big and beautiful world out here of us gays.

Your parents are shitty and are supposed to love you unconditionally. Why are they so disgusting towards not accepting a family member\u2019s (your) happiness?

Be kind to yourself, be compassionate to yourself, and focus on BEING and BECOMING yourself.\n3. I'd remind them you still CAN get married and have children, if that's what you choose.  My sister-in-law and wife have a child they adopted, and they are wonderful parents.\n\nAll that being said, you will have to deal with their anger while they process things.

You don't owe it to them to 'be straight' and if they are going to be angry at you for this and treat you like crap, maybe you should start making plans to leave as soon as you are able. The saying \"blood is thicker than water\" actually means \"blood of the covenant is thicker than water of the womb\", meaning the family you choose can mean more than the family you were born into. Just because you are blood related to someone doesnt mean you have to take their abuse, especially for something like this. There are alot of people in the LGBTQ+ community who have been through the same thing and can be your found family.

You are NOT a disappointment. You are NOT in the wrong. You are completely normal. Don't ever forget that. People can be cruel. Far too many people shouldn't have the right to have kids. Absolutely no one should be okay with abuse, neglect, and emotional harm inflicted on children JUST to keep those population numbers up. \n\nI'm so damn sorry you're being treated this way. Your little gut was telling you not to tell them because you knew the outcome wouldn't be positive. Sucks your uncle caught you. Your family is delusional, bigoted, and awful. I'm beyond pissed. I'm 41 (non-binary demi) and ashamed of fellow millennials who treat their children this way. I'm never having kids, but even if I did, I'd never shame them for being part of the community I'm also in. Even if I was cis and straight (like I thought I was when I was young), I'd be their biggest supporter.

You should be able to share personal information when you feel ready, and not because somebody else expects you to.

You are very young to have the lesson that you can only live your life for you and that you must be true to you if you have any chance of happiness. You deserve love, compassion, and the space you hold on this world.
