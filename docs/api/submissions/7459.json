Even if it was intentional NTA.", "NTA at all. Tell her to ask her parents how to grocery shop", "NTA. You handled the situation correctly as far as I\u2019m concerned. She is an adult and can look online to learn how to shop and cook. I recommend budgetbytes.", "NTA.  Roommate is too selfish.  The assumption that your purpose was to deny her access to your food is the proof.  She needs to grow up and stop assuming actions and motives of other people.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin her meals, she ruined them by being an entitled brat. It\u2019s time to put your foot down and explicitly tell her to not take your food without asking first. \n\nI\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t tried to stand on a stool or chair.", "Nope NtA. Should of told her if the shoe fist to wear it!", "NTA. Why should you pay for her food? Theft is theft, and that is what she has being committing. It is very kind of you to explain it away with her not being used to do grocery shopping. Well, guess what? If she wants to eat, she should learn, quickly at that.", "NTA, you should have started with, \u201cwait\u2026 what? You\u2019ve been taking my food?\u201d", "Nta. She only had an issue when she couldn\u2019t steal your food anymore. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. You should have told her you didn't realize she had been stealing your stuff.", "NTA. I can't believe she told you that you ruined HER meals. She was laying claim to your food and functioning under the assumption the food was hers too. Right there. She doesn't acknowledge the food belongs to you. You're already a step behind. \n\nHopefully, your grocery store pic set her straight. Keep on keeping your shit up high. Carry on.", "Nta. She needs to learn to do basics for herself. Might I suggest sitting down with her and helping her learn how to plan groceries and maybe even cooking basic meals.", "NTA.  Even though my college days were many, many years ago, I remember how irritating it was in one place where my roommates just helped themselves to my food.  The other thing I hated was that I started college with many living skills, such as cooking, cleaning, ironing, laundry, shopping while so many had no skills whatsoever.  You have legitimate complaints.", "Nta you are not responsible for her. You didn't ruin anything. She needs to be responsible for herself and go buy her own groceries. Just because she and the other roommate had an agreement about the food that doesn't give her right to go behind your back and steal your food. If she can  make and prepare food she stole from you and if she can come home with fruits and granola bars she can manage to buy her own groceries her self.", "NTA. She admitted to eating food you bought, so she is the Ahole. \n\nAs for the grocery text, She played silly games and won silly prizes. \n\nIt is important to clear the air and tell her that you buy the exact amount of food you need, but if you ever have extra, you will offer it to her. \n\nYou should also try to solve the ongoing problem in a way that she can save face and not feel defensive. \n\nI think you should get free food from a food pantry and give it to her, without telling her where you got it. \nIn the US, you can Google \"food distributions near me\" to find where free groceries are given out. You can also call 211 (United Way local resource directory).", "I think mixture of NTA and You are the asshole for doing the whole local grocery stores, to be fair she did take it as a personal attack right away though. I say when you see her next to explain that you genuinely didn\u2019t mean to be passive aggressive, but also maybe say you\u2019ll apologize for the grocery store if she apologizes for getting so angry and instantly assuming you meant it like that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However\u2026 I knew someone like this who just had no idea how to do groceries and feed themselves because their parents never bothered to teach them. He literally bought baby food because he didn\u2019t know how else to eat healthy. If you are feeling extra magnanimous and have the time and energy (and if you honestly think she is sheltered and not just manipulative). I would recommend offering to take her grocery shopping with you a couple of times, maybe help her make a simple meal plan?  If she truely is clueless, why not help the poor kid get a clue?\n\nFYI: I can\u2019t take the credit for teaching my friend how to shop; it was someone else.
