A co worker of mine i share a break room with asked me out to a Red Robin's after knowing each other for over 2 years. I was surprised she even asked me, and i happily agreed. I told her I knew the manager there and that I could get us a discount. She said that sounds great, and we set a date. A few hours later after talking to my friend who is the manager isn't closing that night, so I call my friend and tell her we should go to an Outback, where a manager I know, is working and can help us out with a discount. (A complete lateral move in  prices and menu, not much changes if anything it was closer to us both) The day comes and she tells me she no longer had a ride to our date. And she asks me for an uber to our destination. I agree to it because I wanted to see her. She misses the first uber because she took too long getting ready. Sooo\u00f2 I order another uber for her and she arrives 40 mins after we agreed on a time. I'll be honest I had 2 beers as I waited for her. She finally arrived and ordered herself a drink right away.\nShe ordered 2 appetizers and a steak dinner, and before the appetizers came out she asked for another drink too keep up with me. My buddy came out and dropped off our appetizers and steak dinners and gave us amazing service. I personally thought everything was going super well. We were having a good time drinking and eating. She ordered a dessert I had no interest in because I was finishing off my Moscow mule as a liquid dessert. She has had 4 drinks at this point and ask for one more after her desert. I start drinking water because I still have to drive myself home. Anyways we talk for a while and chop it up. My buddy comes by and offers us the bill, it was 30 minutes before closing so I tell him we'll take it. I'm not sure if I said it rudely but I asked, how do you want to split the bill. After she had already packed up mine and hers leftovers and the Appetizers all together, she said with a straight face, \"I thought you were going to pay since you invited me out?!\" I was absolutely confused, because she had invited me out. So I bring this up and she says since I changed the location so it was now my invitation to her. I was a little upset at first but I didn't want to make a fuss because I'd known her for a while and it seemed like we hit it off. Whatever I pay for it. I offer her a ride home and she tells me she's not comfortable that I know where she lives. Sooooo I order her another uber, which still gives me her address so I don't understand her reasoning. \n\nWe sit and talk for about 10 minutes before her uber arrives and I hug her goodnight. As we're hugging she kisses me on the lips, and I kiss her back. She gets in her uber and goes home. Nights over, but honestly ended and started super wierd.\n\nBut a couple days later she text me and asks me why I would even ask her to pay on the first date which confused me even more. Should i tell her i drove her to and from Outback after she invited me out? And that she took all the leftovers home? What the hell did i do wrong? Am I the a**hole?\n\n", "created_utc": 1702921683, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18leq10/aita_my_coworker_asked_me_out_on_a_date_and_is/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She asked you out on the date. Ordinarily that would mean she pays. Despite that she asked you out on the date, you arranged to find a good location where you could get a nice discount which would save her money on the date.\n\nIt sounds like you paid for two ubers for her on a date she asked you out to and that was zero percent your responsibility, which would have been even more reason for her to pay for the whole outback bill and tip, if not also reimburse you for the ubers.\n\nIf you offered to split the bill with her, that would have been above and beyond, especially as she ordered more food, drinks, and indicated she intended to take home with her all the left overs. She should have reimbursed you entirely for the ubers.\n\nYou are NTA, OP; your coworker/date is.\n\nHow did y\u2019all resolve this? Financially I mean.\n\nI\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re fortunate to have found out so much about her on the first date that there won\u2019t be subsequent dates, but that nevertheless she\u2019ll drag you at the office and claim you asked her out and then had the nerve to expect you to pay or split the bill with her so she dumped you narrative.\n\nBullet dodged.", "NTA....I am a woman, and maybe its my generation,  but if *I* ask you, I AM PAYING.

She asked you to order an uber, didn't get it on time, then had the audacity to ask you to pay for another one - you should have stopped things right here.

Why should she expect you to pay for it all?\n\nBut also, don\u2019t shit where you eat. Dating co-workers almost always ends poorly", "HAHA! She scammed you big time. Lesson learned, friend. It doesnt give you any of your money back but you are definitely NTA.", "Ps did you ask her why she thought you asked her out?", "Your co-worker asks YOU out on a date and expects you to pay for it.

Even if she's just dumb and doesn't understand, she's still showing red flags because of how much she ordered and taking YOUR leftover with her.

I always assume the asker is paying, although I always carry enough money for what I eat/drink.

I hope this doesn't make it uncomfortable for you when you're at work, but she was totally in the wrong.", "NTA. And she ordered all that food and drink with the assumption that someone else would pay? She is rude and it's a good thing you can see what she is before you got more involved.", "NTA. I would be honest with her. If it helps to think about it in a different scenario, like you are going out to eat with your friend. Would you let them treat you this way? And did she even ask if she could take all the leftovers? Her actions make her come across as very selfish and manipulative. Depending on what she tells you if you do decide to confront her will tell you all you need to know about her. Her sincerely apologizing would, in my mind, extend another chance, but if she comes back with the same bullshit she already gave you, I\u2019d let that one go. Good luck!", "NTA but cut non-work ties now", "Cue: Pikachu face....", "\u2026.why couldnt you pick her up for the date?", "So how did it end, did she offer you sex if you pay for the meal, did she split the check, start crying saying she didn't have any money??", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
