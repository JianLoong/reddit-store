A co worker of mine i share a break room with asked me out to a Red Robin's after knowing each other for over 2 years. I was surprised she even asked me, and i happily agreed. I told her I knew the manager there and that I could get us a discount. She said that sounds great, and we set a date. A few hours later after talking to my friend who is the manager isn't closing that night, so I call my friend and tell her we should go to an Outback, where a manager I know, is working and can help us out with a discount. (A complete lateral move in  prices and menu, not much changes if anything it was closer to us both) The day comes and she tells me she no longer had a ride to our date. And she asks me for an uber to our destination. I agree to it because I wanted to see her. She misses the first uber because she took too long getting ready. Sooo\u00f2 I order another uber for her and she arrives 40 mins after we agreed on a time. I'll be honest I had 2 beers as I waited for her. She finally arrived and ordered herself a drink right away.\nShe ordered 2 appetizers and a steak dinner, and before the appetizers came out she asked for another drink too keep up with me. My buddy came out and dropped off our appetizers and steak dinners and gave us amazing service. I personally thought everything was going super well. We were having a good time drinking and eating. She ordered a dessert I had no interest in because I was finishing off my Moscow mule as a liquid dessert. She has had 4 drinks at this point and ask for one more after her desert. I start drinking water because I still have to drive myself home. Anyways we talk for a while and chop it up. My buddy comes by and offers us the bill, it was 30 minutes before closing so I tell him we'll take it. I'm not sure if I said it rudely but I asked, how do you want to split the bill. After she had already packed up mine and hers leftovers and the Appetizers all together, she said with a straight face, \"I thought you were going to pay since you invited me out?!\" I was absolutely confused, because she had invited me out. So I bring this up and she says since I changed the location so it was now my invitation to her. I was a little upset at first but I didn't want to make a fuss because I'd known her for a while and it seemed like we hit it off. Whatever I pay for it. I offer her a ride home and she tells me she's not comfortable that I know where she lives. Sooooo I order her another uber, which still gives me her address so I don't understand her reasoning. \n\nWe sit and talk for about 10 minutes before her uber arrives and I hug her goodnight. As we're hugging she kisses me on the lips, and I kiss her back. She gets in her uber and goes home. Nights over, but honestly ended and started super wierd.\n\nBut a couple days later she text me and asks me why I would even ask her to pay on the first date which confused me even more. Should i tell her i drove her to and from Outback after she invited me out? And that she took all the leftovers home? What the hell did i do wrong? Am I the a**hole?\n\n", "created_utc": 1702921683, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18leq10/aita_my_coworker_asked_me_out_on_a_date_and_is/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Depending on what she tells you if you do decide to confront her will tell you all you need to know about her.
