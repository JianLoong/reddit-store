{"id": 11812, "submission_id": "11m93ek", "title": "AITA for excluding my autistic daughter from Frozen Night?", "selftext": "Hi Reddit, I (34F) am a mother of three daughters: Emma (10F), Lily (8F), and Olivia (14F). Emma and Lily are typical kids, while Olivia is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). She has loud vocal tics, which means she sometimes makes repetitive and involuntary sounds or words.\n\nRecently, my husband and I wanted to treat our daughters to a Frozen night at the movie theater. We planned to watch Frozen 2 on the big screen, where the theater is doing sing-alongs and having a Frozen-themed dinner during the intermission. Emma and Lily were thrilled, and so was Olivia. She's a huge fan of Frozen and has been looking forward to the movie for weeks.\n\nHowever, I'm hesitant to bring Olivia along, mainly because of her loud tics. I'm worried that her vocal outbursts might disturb other moviegoers and ruin their experience. I know some people might be understanding, but others might not, and it's not fair to subject them to the noise. Additionally, the movie theater might be too overwhelming for Olivia, with its loud sound system and bright lights.\n\nMy husband thinks we should bring Olivia anyway, as it's not fair to exclude her from a movie she's been waiting for. He also believes that we can prepare Olivia for the movie and explain the social rules, such as keeping quiet during the movie. However, I'm still worried about the potential negative reactions from other people.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for not bringing my autistic daughter to Frozen night at the movie theater?\n\nAdditional info:\n\nOlivia is aware of her tics and has been working with a therapist to manage them. However, they still occur frequently, especially when she's excited or anxious.\n\nWe've had mixed experiences with public outings in the past. Sometimes, people have been understanding and supportive of Olivia's condition, while other times, they've stared, made rude comments, or even complained to the staff.\n\nWe have a backup plan for Olivia if we decide not to bring her to the movie. She can stay home with her grandma and have a special Frozen-themed movie night with her favorite snacks.\n\nThank you for reading and sharing your thoughts.", "created_utc": 1678311707, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11m93ek/aita_for_excluding_my_autistic_daughter_from/", "score": 1347, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get a free trial then cancel it. Do that before you exclude your daughter from any experience.", "YTA, if you had doubts about bringing your 14 yo autistic daughter to an event, you never should have brought it up in the first place.\n\nOn top of that, this is a sing along. You\u2019re not exactly taking her to see something with a dead quiet audience; if anything that\u2019s a great place for her to experience a movie theater and potentially make noise and NOT disrupt anyone. And if it is overstimulating, you or your husband can be a parent and miss the experience to take care of your daughter, by either bringing her outside, another location, or home. \n\nBring separate cars. Don\u2019t have separate cars? You or husband can drive her home/elsewhere, and everyone else takes an Uber when the movie is done. There\u2019s so many solutions here, and not even looking for them/calling a movie night in with grandma equivalent makes YTA.", "YTA. Have you ever been to a kids sing-a-long? It's loud AF. Your daughter wouldn't be disturbing anyone. You're right to worry about them disturbing your daughter, but maybe she'll be so happy to be participating that she won't get anxious. You already promised her this so she should get a chance to try.", "NAH. It would be better for the other movie goers to not bring her. But why would you get her excited about going if you're not sure you're taking her?!", "I work with neurodivergent folks myself, and I would say bring her along. It can be very tough to bring an autistic person to the movies, but considering all the other kids will be singing along and also making noise, I don't think it will be a big deal to other moviegoers. All you would get from not bringing her is one peaceful day and potentially a very angry little girl, who may remember this for a long time. I understand your concern and frustration, and I feel like a lot of the people in these comments simply don't get how difficult it is to be in this situation. At the end of the day, how will she learn to behave if you don't give her opportunities to learn? This is a perfect teaching moment. You got this!", "YTA, your kid might surprise you especially if she really wants to go. Give her the chance and if she fails well that's cool too give her another chance after that.", "YWBTA- instead of excluding her, let her go and have fun. If it turns out she can't handle it, then go with an exit plan. \n\nInstead of assuming the worst, hope for the best and plan accordingly. Why stop her from enjoying things?", "YTA, you care more about other people's reactions then bringing your daughter to see a movie she's been so excited to see. It doesn't matter if she has ASD or not.", "bring her. its  not her fault she's different and only people with kids will be there. they will understand.", "Some people are suggesting this is a complicated situation, but it's actually pretty simple.\n\nYour daughter is obviously aware of this event and has been looking forward to it for weeks. If you pull the rug out from under her now, you're saying, \"I don't care how hard you're trying, it doesn't matter that you're working in therapy, it's not enough.\"\n\nFor that alone, YTA.", "Don't do this. \n\nYou're not saying it, but your actions will tell her that she's different and an embarrassment to you. Don't damage her confidence and heart over a movie outing, it's not worth it.\n\nGo, enjoy the night and even if the other movie goers look at you funny, you make a funnier look! Your daughter deserves to have a fighter in her corner, not someone that feels more embarrassment and shame than she probably is already feeling.\n\nYtA.\n\nYou know how many people I've told to be quiet in the movies? A lot! It'd just part of the experience at this point.", "Soft YTA\n\nMy daughter is autistic and I can count on one hand how many times we have been to a movie theatre with her in her 12 years.  So I fully empathize with the deliberation of when taking her places is appropriate for her or for others around her.\n\nBut there in this case there will be so many kids being loud and yelling at Olaf or giggling. Most people won't notice. It's a singalong so I doubt that normal movie etiquette will be kept. If it is all too much take her out.\n\nAlso does she have noise cancelling headphones? They are a must for us in a movie theatre", "I think this is one of those hard situations. You don't want to exclude your daughter, but you know that there is the possibility that that it will either be too much for her or it might dim the enjoyment for other moviegoers. \n\nIs there anyway that one of you could take her to a different time of the show/sing along so if it's too much for her you can leave without your other children having to leave, too? \n\nNAH. It's tough situation.", "Everyone has legit concerns here, but it's a sing along full of kids, not a bunch of adults watching a special screening of \"Citizen Kane\".  The theater will be noisy already.  It's a sing-along.  Bring all your kids.  And since your eldest is 14, you've had time to learn how to deal with people's reactions to her tics and vocalizations (without shaming your daughter for something she can't control).", "YTA, Since she knows the others are going. All you can do is try and hope for the best outcome.", "YTA. There was plenty of ways to prepare her. You not taking her is excluding her from not only a family thing BUT you are making her feel left out and could hurt her in the long run.", "I wouldn\u2019t say YTA cause I understand where you\u2019re coming from but not including her because of something she can\u2019t control isn\u2019t fair. Also what does that say to her if you\u2019re willing to leave her while you guys go out to have family time. Just bring her along and if something happens, just come back with her or do something else. She do have two parents. If needed for her to leave, one of you can just go be with her.", "Yta and horrible parent if you exclude your daughter cause someone might give you a funny look", "I have a daughter that has ADHD and ASD. She also has some loud ticks. I understand why you feel hesitant to bring her and why you have mixed reactions from other families. That being said: YTA. You told her about the movie and got her all excited to go with her family. To pull her out now is unfair to her. My local theater does showings for autistic children. Maybe you should look into that.", "YTA. Not for not wanting to take her, I can't judge that, but for getting her excited first and then planning to exclude and disappoint her, even though you know how much it means to her and how much she has been looking forward to it.\n\nAlso, she is 14. Even though she has ASD, can't you involve her in the decision? Maybe she agrees she'd be happier at home with grandma, and maybe she is desperate to try.", "YTA because you shouldn\u2019t have told Olivia about it  if you weren\u2019t gonna bring her. \n\nAlso INFO: she\u2019s 14 now shouldn\u2019t you have been helping her much sooner to manage these outbursts? Genuinely asking for understanding\u2026I\u2019m not sure if they just recently developed, but I think that has weight in the judgement as well. \n\nOlivia deserves the chance to be in public and start learning. I do appreciate that you considered other people tho, but she\u2019s your daughter so you gotta put her first. It\u2019s a singalong so it\u2019ll be loud enough to cover her.", "So many saying you're the asshole. I feel like it's a no win situation.\n\nTake Olivia and ruin it for the people around her if she has audible tics.\n\nLeave Olivia and ruin it for her because she was excited over it.\n\nStay in and ruin it for your children because they wanted to go.\n\nWhatever you do, you aren't the asshole. Nobody is.\n\nNAH", "I think there are more ways. Like noise canceling headphones when it gets too loud, sunglasses if it's too bright, something (like a cozy blanket) to calm down or just going outside to get some fresh air and do some calming exercises, one parent goes home with her if she thinks that she can't handle the overstimulation. So, YTA for the hard cut between yes and no", "Okay I'm the type of person that I hate when people are loud and interrupt a movie I am paying my good money to see, \n\nbut.   \nYTA. Even I, curmudgeon that I am, wouldn't even think of getting upset about a neurodivergent child who was obviously just loud because they were so excited and having a good time.  (A bratty kid running up and down the aisles, different).  Real inclusion means just that. Including everyone.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019ve promised your NT kids a fun activity that meets their needs, which you must not cancel if it\u2019s avoidable. Your autistic child is looking forward to attending the showing. \n\nLet Olivia try. Have a plan for communicating with Olivia during the show, and for escorting her out temporarily if necessary without disrupting your other kids\u2019 fun. Go in two cars if necessary. And let Olivia know that if she needs to leave (singalongs too loud or whatever), it\u2019s okay. She will get to attend a sensory showing later if possible, or you\u2019ll do a special screening at home with a nice dinner, maybe some themed treats.", "YTA. She's already super excited about this night and you will CRUSH her if you tell her she can't go. I'm autistic and if I had been told this and given a \"backup plan\" night I still would have felt extremely fobbed off and condescended to. This isn't about her, it's about you and the reactions of strangers. Also keep in mind that ND individuals are very often a few years behind their peers, maturity wise, so Olivia might be 14 but she may not yet feel like a teenager/feels closer to her sisters ages in terms of interests and things. (I was definitely like that). This is an opportunity for her and her sisters to go to a thing together and bond over their love for Frozen. \n\nCall the cinema and ask what these nights are like. If they're loud and rowdy with people moving around a lot then literally nobody will mind. Maybe they have a specific event for disabled and ND people. Many cinemas and live performance theatres do events like that these days. But don't you dare put this on her. She will hate herself and blame herself.", "NTA. Part of planning to take a child with different needs anywhere is drawing plans for which parent will have to step out and be with them if they can\u2019t enjoy the show. If that always falls on you and your husband isn\u2019t willing to cooperate with that, then wanting the other kids to enjoy the show doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. The show just isn\u2019t for her. There will be other things that will be and you can plan for better. Olivia\u2019s a little older, does she do well with earphones that block out most the sound? Is there other shows that would be more accommodating/less triggering so she can enjoy them?", "NAH. It\u2019s a difficult situation for everyone involved. You\u2019re not an AH for considering not taking her. Alternatively, could you prepare her for a situation where if her ticks get out of control, then either you or your husband will take her to a quiet place to calm down for a short time before being able to go back to watching the show? It could be a good opportunity to work on coping mechanisms.", "YTA. She\u2019s 14, have you even asked her what she wants? You\u2019ve said she\u2019s trying to control her outbursts so why not have a conversation with her about whether she wants to come and thinks she can handle it. If she does, come up with a plan together for how to handle it if it all becomes too overwhelming. If she doesn\u2019t want to go, plan some exciting for one of you to do with her instead (and make it more exciting than sitting at home).", "YTA - it is wild to me that you\u2019d introduce this as a possibility for her to get excited about if you didn\u2019t have a plan already in place to cope with her needs there or a firm commitment to make one. \n\nTake all the kids and make sure there\u2019s an extra adult there that\u2019s on Designated Olivia Watch - to help her manage her outbursts or be ready to walk out with her if the stimulation is too much. Be honest with her about the extra stim beforehand but not to secretly make her dread or want to drop out - just let her know that you\u2019re excited for her to have a good time and you\u2019re ready to support what that needs to look like for her.", "YTA.\n\n1. So you want to exclude Olivia because you are scared that she would \"inconvenience\" others. It baffles me that you care more about other people's convenience than your own daughter's feelings. Come on, it is not like she is going to wreak havoc. Give the kid a chance!! \n\n2. How long are you planning on keeping Olivia isolated from fun events? Let me tell you this, she knows. She understands what you are doing and she does feel bad. Also, she won't forget any of this! \n\n3. It is a kids movie. Olivia won't be the only autistic kid there.", "YTA. Building up her hopes and then shooting them down by excluding her is wrong. Further, there are ways that you can make this plan or a similar one and include her.\n\nFrozen 2 is already out, so watch this on Disney+. Then for another day plan for the whole family to attend one of AMC's sensory friendly family movie showings and make this work. \n\n[https://www.amctheatres.com/programs/sensory-friendly-films](https://www.amctheatres.com/programs/sensory-friendly-films)\n\n>AMC is proud to partner with the Autism Society to offer unique movie showings where we turn the lights up, and turn the sound down, so you can get up, dance, walk, shout or sing! Our Sensory Friendly Film program is available on the second and fourth Saturday (family-friendly) and Wednesday evenings (mature audiences) of every month. Please check your local theatre listings for specific showtimes, and don't forget to share your family fun with #AMCSensoryFriendly.", "Absolutely, YTA. You're her mother and you're so focused on what other people may think that you're not considering how your own daughter will feel. She's going to spend her life struggling with these issues, but the message from her parent that she is unworthy of experiencing a world where others may disapprove of her disability adds so much weight to her burden. \n\nBring Olivia. If people don't understand, fuck them. She deserves to experience a full life.", "NAH. But you should really consider bringing her. I Can understand not wanting to bother others, but a sing along will likely be louder anyway (the tics may not stick out as much) and this is an opportunity for the family to all do something fun. She will feel horribly excluded if she isn\u2019t allowed to come. Maybe make a game plan for either you or dad to take over if things get too much for her. Maybe the arcade or outside? But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for considering it. It sounds like a hard decision all around. I hope everything goes well for you all! Maybe she will end up surprising you.", "YTA - Unless Olivia\u2019s vocal tics include long rants of profanity or slurs, I see no reason why a movie showing encouraging audience participation would be an inappropriate place for her. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first time that they\u2019ve seen an autistic teenager. If she gets overwhelmed, there\u2019s always the option of stepping outside, or bringing earplugs for her to help her with the noise.", "YTA. You\u2019ve obviously told all the kids about it and even if you hadn\u2019t Olivia would have found out. She shouldn\u2019t be hidden away because of her disability. You implement all of the tools learned in therapy to help her limit her vocal tics and if they become a disruption you follow whatever advise the therapist gives for those situations. If taking her outside for a moment helps do that. If redirecting her with a fidget toy helps do that. Don\u2019t exclude her.", "YTA & I can\u2019t believe you wrote all of that out and still felt the need to ask.", "NTA - I think not bringing her is the most generous thing you can do for Emma, Lily and every other person in attendance.  I know I will be downvoted and called ablest, but really, how is it far to others at the movie to have to listen to Olivia.  Is there is a special low stimulation showing?  that might be a good compromise.", "YTA. It seems like this event will probably have lots of kids who will potentially make some noise. Especially if it\u2019s a song-a-long! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to exclude her while you take your other children to a special event. It kind of sounds like you\u2019re more concerned about what others will think than about what\u2019s fair to your daughter. You may get some stares or comments, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth leaving her behind.", "NTA\n\nI think people (including myself) who are not parents of autistic children can not at all understand what these people go through on a daily basis. Not only is this mother trying to be considerate of her own kid who she feels will be overwhelmed by the sounds and theater, she is also trying to be considerate of other movie goers who paid for their tickets. She is trying to make everyone happy in what seems to be a lose-lose situation.\n\nOlivia seems like she\u2019s old enough to have a rational conversation with and while I\u2019m sure she will be disappointed, I\u2019m sure if you suggest doing something special with her separately she will be okay. Mama, you are not at all an ass hole in this situation. It sounds like you are trying really hard to please everyone", "YTA and so fucking ableist.", "NTA, you know your daughter best. If you think it will be too much for her and will disturb others I would not bring her. You also want the other two girls to have a good time.", "If it\u2019s a sing along, the theatre will be loud, will anyone hear Olivia\u2019s tics? Can she wear ear defenders to reduce her sensitivity to the noise? Also, talk to her. I prep my 7 yo ASD daughter both what to expect and how we\u2019re going to deal with her being overwhelmed, like stepping out to have a break if she needs. \n\nBasically, make her aware of potential stimulations,  let her know not to wait until she over stimulated and let her know what actions she can take, while taking any precautions. \n\nYTA if you exclude her", "YTA.\n\nDon't exclude your daughter - she can't help who she is. You find ways to work with who she is, and it sounds like a rambunctious sing along theatre situation with tons of overly excited kids sounds like the perfect place to let her be herself ... AND ... if it's too much for her? Have a plan with Hubs to handle that in a graceful way.\n\nBeing home with grandma to watch frozen on the tv while your sisters get a whole experience all because you can't help but be who you are ... well that's shitty.", "Yta if you do this. Decide which parent gets to step out with her if she needs to de-stimulate instead.", "NAH but you shouldn't have told her about it until you made a final decision. I understand your hesitancy to hurt other people's experiences having been in those situation. For what its worth, it could be a moment for other children to build compassion. I wouldn't want to deprive your other daughters of movie theatre experiences either. You and your husband know your daughter best and should make a decision together, not reddit.", "Um YTA big time. What the hell? I think considering it\u2019s going to be mostly parents with their kids you don\u2019t need to worry. Most parents will understand.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI think where you are coming from is from a good-hearted place but you cannot build up her hopes then take them away. Thats an ah move. She is going to need to learn to navigate with world and doing this is only going to make her feel further excluded then she likely does on a daily basis. \n\nHonestly have you considered keeping ALL the girls home and doing a movie night at home? Frozen themed?", "It's a sing-along.  People are expected to be louder than a usual movie.  Unless the tics are extreme, like swearing-based tics in some presentations of Tourette's, or loud enough to really startle or scare people, I think it is worth bringing her.\n\nYTA", "\"Emma and Lily we're thrilled, and so was Olivia\"\n\nSo Olivia is already aware of this cinema trip, and now you're planning on taking that away from her? Whilst still talking your other two daughters? That's cold, OP. YTA.", "Wow I\u2018m gobsmacked that you even have the nerve to pretend that you are being considerate of other people when in reality you are embarrassed that people sometimes stare if your daughter gets excited/nervous.\n\nBack-up plan\u2026. Sorry Olivia we cannot have you embarrassing us on a very special Frozen night at the theatre (which we told you about because we just want to punish you for your autism \ud83d\udc7f).  So instead of spending a fun time with the rest of the family watching the movie and having a nice frozen themed dinner you can stay home with grandma and have some \u201csnacks\u201d \ud83d\ude44.\n\nYou are not only an a\\*shole but an ableist one at that.\n\nYTA", "YTA- what tf kind of shit is this. I feel really sorry for your daughter.", "YTA\n\nYou can't hide your daughter away forever just because she has a disability. Instead of worrying how other people might react to her stimming, come up with a plan for how to handle the situation if/when it happens.  Give her the tools and skills to cope when she gets overwhelmed or excited. But do not deny her the opportunity to the movies with her sisters.", "If you had this concern from the beginning, I would've never ever suggested it in the first place. Why set your daughter up for disappointment in the first place?", "That is your daughter, I could not imagine leaving a kid out because they have a disability. You should of thought about your kid and taken her because she would enjoy the moment . If you are concerned about your daughter because of that disability she deserves better parents .", "Bring noise cancelling headphones, earplugs and sunglasses maybe to help with the noise and lights?", "Personally it\u2019s kind of a yes and no situation. As someone who is Neurodivergent, if my mom didn\u2019t wanna take me out because of it I would be upset. I say talk to your daughter and your husband about thus", "NTA \n\nI'm going to sound like an AH \n\nI think you're being courteous to those in the theater who may want to enjoy the movie without outburst. Kids will be kids but there are different expectations for let's say a 4 year old vs a 14 year old. Yes society has become more accommodating to people with different needs but it's still slightly annoying when things go awry. \n\nI think if you want to include her go to a matinee, where it's more appropriate for kids to make noise and be disruptive.\n\n I'm not a professional but with a family member that has special needs to get her used to behaving properly in public places was going during their slow hours. That way no one felt rushed, there weren't as many people, it was less overwhelming etc. Every child is different and will have their own learning curve.", "To be honest I don\u2019t know. Ultimately if you do take her and things get weird with others there, then the night is ruined for everyone. If not , then you are leaving her and excluding her. Maybe dad can take her and do something while you take the younger girls or vice versa.", "NAH\n\nMom of a kid with lots of tics. I get it. It\u2019s always anxiety inducing to try weigh all the possible outcomes. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole. The only people who can decide if she can handle it are you and your husband. If the situation is anything like our house, that decision can really only be made in the moment. I\u2019m sorry the world isn\u2019t an easier place to navigate with our kids. \n\n\n\nI would also say your younger kids deserve special events that aren\u2019t balanced around whether eldest can handle it or parental stress at keeping the eldest managed. You and your husband do too, especially since you\u2019ve got a backup option for Olivia.", "I don't really understand here, it seems Olivia is someone you can speak to and communicate with pretty well (unlike some autistic people, is my point). Can you not simply explain to her your concerns, and let her know that if it gets bad, you or dad will step out of the movie with her and keep her company, and she can do a frozen party at home?\n\nI understand your concerns about disturbing others, but just be prepared to leave if it gets bad, no?\n\nI feel like you're really over-complicating this and needlessly excluding your daughter, but it is so hard for me to know because we only have this brief blurb to go off of, and do not really know what Olivia is like. Maybe it'd be a real problem, only you know, but if it were me I'd be inclined to take her and see what happens. The very worst case scenario is you leave the movie.", "NAH. Lots to consider here\u2026 but if you weren\u2019t going to take her I wouldn\u2019t have told her to begin with. It seems you should take her since she knows and has been excited, you have been in these situations with her before it seems and you should know how to properly field it. In the future, throwing a big movie party at home can be a TON of fun! With friends and snacks and loads of fun! Dress everyone up! Projector and screen (easy as a white sheet hung on a wall).", "Yes YTA\n\nIt's a night specifically for kids. \n\nEven without a mental difference, kids are loud.\n\nIf you're worried, call up the theater and check with them. \n\nBring along some noise canceling headphones, earbuds, etc. whatever accommodations you think your daughter might need based on what she might encounter. \n\nShe needs practice using her coping strategies and seeking her own accommodations. Leaving her at home while yall have fun not only deprives her of a growth opportunity, it also further shows her that you care less about her wellbeing and growth as a human being.", "I don\u2019t feel like this is the best place for you to be getting advice from but since you asked\u2026 YTA. Please don\u2019t exclude your daughter and perhaps discuss all this with her therapist on how best to prepare her for these types of situations. They will come up more and more as she grows. Avoiding them will only make her feel excluded and like there\u2019s something wrong with her and it won\u2019t allow her to gain the tools she needs to cope.", "take *all* your kids to the movies. lots of kids for various reasons cant keep quiet, and especially if they are encouraging singalongs it will not be a quiet theatre.\n\nNAH except people who shush kids at a kids movie", "To be clear, I read the whole post, but I didn't have to read any further than the first half of the title to know YTA on this one. \n\nDo you want to cause a rift between your children?\n\nBecause that is how you cause a rift between your children.", "You already shared your plans to go there.

Emma and Lily are typical kids, while Olivia is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). She has loud vocal tics, which means she sometimes makes repetitive and involuntary sounds or words.\n\nRecently, my husband and I wanted to treat our daughters to a Frozen night at the movie theater. We planned to watch Frozen 2 on the big screen, where the theater is doing sing-alongs and having a Frozen-themed dinner during the intermission. Emma and Lily were thrilled, and so was Olivia. She's a huge fan of Frozen and has been looking forward to the movie for weeks.\n\nHowever, I'm hesitant to bring Olivia along, mainly because of her loud tics. I'm worried that her vocal outbursts might disturb other moviegoers and ruin their experience. I know some people might be understanding, but others might not, and it's not fair to subject them to the noise. Additionally, the movie theater might be too overwhelming for Olivia, with its loud sound system and bright lights.\n\nMy husband thinks we should bring Olivia anyway, as it's not fair to exclude her from a movie she's been waiting for. He also believes that we can prepare Olivia for the movie and explain the social rules, such as keeping quiet during the movie. However, I'm still worried about the potential negative reactions from other people.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for not bringing my autistic daughter to Frozen night at the movie theater?\n\nAdditional info:\n\nOlivia is aware of her tics and has been working with a therapist to manage them. However, they still occur frequently, especially when she's excited or anxious.\n\nWe've had mixed experiences with public outings in the past. Sometimes, people have been understanding and supportive of Olivia's condition, while other times, they've stared, made rude comments, or even complained to the staff.\n\nWe have a backup plan for Olivia if we decide not to bring her to the movie. She can stay home with her grandma and have a special Frozen-themed movie night with her favorite snacks.\n\nThank you for reading and sharing your thoughts.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she can't go, no one goes. It's that simple. You shouldn't exclude her from something she already knows about and is excited to do. \n\nAlso, you said it's a singalong, it's not a normal quiet movie experience so people will probably be a lot less bothered if she makes noise.

Decide what you're going to do in the future before telling her.", "Okay yeah you\u2019re definitely TA. YTA. Look. As and autistic person, our \u201ctics\u201d aren\u2019t really tics, they\u2019re stims. It\u2019s stimming. It\u2019s not a \u201csymptom\u201d of autism but rather a method used to interact and cope with our environment. It\u2019s not unhealthy and it\u2019s very helpful for us autistics to be able to do these things. This therapy isn\u2019t good for her if you\u2019re trying to suppress her stimming. If you looked at accounts from actual autistic people, you\u2019ll find that those who were pushed into ABA therapy that focused on \u201cminimizing\u201d this \u201cbehavior\u201d actually resulted in PTSD symptoms later in life. This is because autistics are often told to reject their primary means of self-regulation. The reason she\u2019s not stopping them is because she *needs* them. This is an important part of her mind\u2019s method of processing information, it\u2019s not something to be corrected. So for one, you need to understand that this isn\u2019t something she does that needs to be stopped. The more you push for her to \u201cfix\u201d this, the more you\u2019re damaging her psychologically. I highly recommend looking into accounts directly from autistic folks regarding this, which you can find in r/autism because you\u2019re gonna hurt her if you force her to suppress her natural means of self-regulation. \n\nThis all on top of the fact that she doesn\u2019t deserve to be excluded. You can\u2019t hide her disability away forever. In the Autistic community, we prefer being called \u201cautistic people\u201d instead of \u201cpeople *with* autism,\u201d because it\u2019s very complex neurological disorder, and not like a mental illness where \u201creducing symptoms\u201d makes it easier for the person. It actually makes it harder. You could go to the r/autism community and *ask* autistic folks what would\u2019ve helped them cope in this situation. As her parent, you\u2019ve gotta give her tools to cope with it all. Headphones to reduce noise but not completely, among other tools that could help her. I feel like you might reject this response, but I want you to know\u2014as someone who\u2019s autistic and in the autistic self advocacy community\u2014that you need to learn, find reliable research, and get a understanding of autistic people. Because the official and professional understanding of it has notably hurt quite a lot of us, really.  It would help you to actually help her find alternative ways to stim vocally. They\u2019re not \u201ctics\u201d they\u2019re \u201cstims,\u201d and suppressing stims can be painful, you end up trying to take away the *natural* means by which your autistic daughter regulates her emotions.", "YTA.\nIt's a children's movie sing along, nobody is going to have a serious issue with a child being noisy.

In the event, Olivia does start being disruptive, even if some nice people don't say anything, they are still being inconvenienced after all. The people who do say something are simply more vocal.

A couple of suggestions for future situations:\n\n- Have a home movie night with your family instead of at the theatres or worst case, one with your two daughters and the other with Olivia\n\n- Have someone take her outside if she's evidently being disruptive during the movie, should you opt to bring her. You don't necessarily have to wait for others to say something; you can judge it yourself\n\nI think it's important for everyone to remember that for every person especially sympathetic towards autism, there is another (who may or may not be vocal about it), who get annoyed/inconvenienced by it. Despite the fact that I PERSONALLY believe society should IDEALLY make concessions for those that need it, they are not OBLIGATED to. And OP is again, a thoughtful person for not forcing her daughter's proclivities upon others.\n\nMy two cents.", "This is absolutely the way. There will be so much noise with people and kids singing that very few will even notice. IMHO this is the best time to take her to a movie.", "I can't believe OP typed that out. JFC. My son is neurodivergent and this breaks my heart.", "It sounds like Olivia is in ABA therapy, which is most cases works to suppress naturally autistic behaviors that help us self-regulate. So I get an icky feeling from this too.", "Had she just put \u201cneuro\u201d in front of typical she\u2019d be totally in the clear, but you\u2019re absolutely right. As it\u2019s written, it comes off very \u201cmy two normal kids\u201d\n\nI say all this as someone who is autistic (also with ADHD, making me two flavours of neurodivergent)", "If she gets overwhelmed in a way that leads to meltdowns, I'd suggest sitting as close to the exit as possible. That would also potentially give her space to stand up and walk around near the door if she needs movement without blocking anyone else's view.", "I am so glad I wasn\u2019t the only one to read \u201cABA\u201d in OP\u2019s post.\nI am so furious.", "Vocal tics and many other behaviors related to ASD, depending on the level, are generally not within the person's control. A tic is a neurological response to stimuli; they are more like a brain reflex similar to how you don't have control over kicking when the spot below your kneecap is hit.", "What I believe the OP is referring to is actually stereotypic behavior (stimming) which is a deeply sensory oriented behavior and different than what you would consider an outburst or a typical tic. It has likely been present for a very, very long time. Stimming can look different for each person. It might be motor for one person (e.g., hand flapping) or vocal like in OP\u2019s case which has the potential be more disruptive. The argument could be made that it should be reduced to some extent so that the behavior doesn\u2019t impede learning or disrupt others but stimming is often self soothing and something that is preferred (again it is sensory oriented). Ethically there is no reason to get rid of it completely and it\u2019s probably not realistic anyway.", "And If the question was \u201cwould I be the asshole for bringing my daughter with audible tics to a movie\u201d I would say YTA\n\nHer tics only stop OTHERS from potentially enjoying things.", "Absolutely. \n\nThere\u2019s a great group on Facebook called Autism Inclusivity. Autistic people answer questions and share guidance on how to include them. \n\nOP YTA. Do better for your daughter. She might be autistic but she\u2019s still human. How on earth could you even consider excluding her like this, without doing everything you could to accommodate her first.", "Also the sibling of an autistic person here. \n\nWorrying that other people gossip about me is the LEAST of my concerns when it comes to my sibling's happiness. \n\nBut I guess you think it's okay to hype up an autistic kid about a movie they want to see, then decide gossip is bad and go back on your word? \n\nYou and OP are both YTA.", "I gave a YTA judgement and I am raising an autistic kid with tics, so I\u2019m pretty comfortable making that judgment.. Accommodations can and should be made so autistic kids can participate in events they are excited about. It sounds like you\u2019ve been in some pretty stressful situations in the past related to your sibling\u2019s autism. I understand that must have been hard and there\u2019s nothing wrong with needing time and activities without your siblings, autistic or not. But other people being a-holes isn\u2019t a good justification to leave one child out of a whole-family activity.", "As someone who is autistic, this is a horrible take. I\u2019ve spent my life getting looks, getting judged, being made to feel uncomfortable simply for fidgeting and covering my ears. The kid is clearly excited to go and should be allowed to her. Her parents being embarrassed and not wanting to deal with it makes them horrible people. IDC if you\u2019re embarrassed by your family member, consider how they feel being left out.", "As I parent of a child with tourettes syndrome I disagree. She should be given the same opportunities as her siblings. If she closes not to go because of the anxiety that's fine, but she can't be offered less than her siblings, that would be awful for her and have a life long affect. \n\nBTW, OP YTA", "I sympathize with parents in this situation. The only thing I would like to ask them of how much of these uncomfortable situations are just you feeling awkward vs putting your child in a legitimately harmful situation. \nFor example: if your autistic child is NOT having a meltdown due to clear signs of distress but is simply excited about their experience - but as a result their behaviour is not \u201cnormal\u201d and therefore other parents may react. Is that YOUR discomfort as a parent? Why miss the child be removed because grown adults are uncomfortable. Im not trying to be obtuse - I\u2019m legitimately asking parents of children who experience these situations.", "That\u2019s exactly my thought! It\u2019s a sing along! The theatre will already have kids being more noisy than a regular showing.", "You make good points, which i took into account in my response. You make very valid points. The only reason i say she is YTA is putting myself in the kids shoes.", "You're right that the sisters deserve to have activities where Olivia will not draw unwanted attention. But an activity they're ALL excited about is not the time for that.", "I'm parenting autistic kids and I'm neurodivergent myself. OP absolutely WBTA if they take their younger two but exclude their eldest. My frozen obsessed 14 year old would be devastated and remember it forever if I did something like that. \n\nI'm also curious about this \"therapy\" to \"manage\" her stims.  Like I understand not wanting stims that are overly disruptive, but we don't stim just for funzies.", "Mom should know this kind of issue might come up. She is definitely an AH.", "Whether you have an autistic child or not doesn't mean you can't understand parenting is hard and each kid is different.", "Not to mention it\u2019s a sing along and won\u2019t be a quiet movie experience regardless.", "This is definitely worth looking into. It will vary by theater of course but we have theaters that only cost $100 to rent out.\n\nYou may also be able to ask for a few accommodations that way too (like turning down the volume or leaving regular lights on so the screen isn\u2019t so harsh).", "THIS THIS THIS. Let her be autistic!!!", "Couldn\u2019t disagree more. 1. This event will be full of kids making all kinds of noise, 2. If it turns out to be overwhelming, one parent can take her outside the theatre to calm her down. It\u2019s cruel to take the other kids and not take Olivia when she\u2019s specifically looking forward to it.", "These are literally just copouts to make herself feel better.", "Here\u2019s the solution. If she does create such a disturbance that it\u2019s negatively affecting all the movie goers then he has to be the one to take her outside to get regulated. NAH, I think this just needed some brainstorming. Having a special needs child isn\u2019t easy and there is no instruction manual. Good luck to you on this journey.", "But Olivia already knows about the plan, and that exclusion will not do her any well. She should be allowed the chance especially since she\u2019s working on her tics in therapy", "I\u2019m 33 and love Frozen. Also her sisters can have 90 minutes away from their sister doing something else. How rude to go do something she also wants to participate in, and exclude her.", "It's not ableist lol.", "It\u2019s a singalong. All the kids will be screaming, it\u2019ll be loud as fuck. No one will notice her.", "This is a good question. She only mentioned an autism diagnosis. As an autistic person, I can attest that our \u201cvocal tics\u201d are stimulatory actions/behavior that are vital to helping us regulate our emotions and ourselves.", "Because everyone who is watching a movie wants to hear, no should be forced to be okay with hearing an autistic child interrupt loudly throughout the movie? It\u2019s a difficult situation but one person being present is now the priority in society, as opposed to, idk 15 other paying movie goers enjoying their experience? I swear as soon as someone is \u201cautistic\u201d it\u2019s like the rest of the world is just supposed to move to accommodate them, which is cool in some instances, but a disability is a disability and it\u2019s not always something that can be worked with reasonably.", "Or even bring the grandma along with the understanding that she takes Olivia out for breaks or whatever if both parents wish to stay with their other kids.", "That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking", "That\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve done this so many times at restaurants with a baby. One parent takes the crying baby out if it\u2019s disruptive.", "That\u2019s our M.O. for our child with ASD. We bring him to the thing when we aren\u2019t sure how he\u2019ll do, and one parent is always ready to take him out if needed. I want to give my son as many opportunities to try and enjoy things as I can, and worst case scenario I just miss out sometimes when I have to be the parent that removes him.", "I mean, it sounds like they've learned that they don't want to deal with it unless they have to, which is exactly why they're seeking to exclude Olivia.", "As somebody with Tourette\u2019s, that\u2019s ridiculous. Tics happen. Yes, they can be held in, to an extent, but it can be extremely uncomfortable. Sometimes they can\u2019t be held in at all, and sometimes they just happen out of the blue. Also, you don\u2019t always know what your tics are going to be, or if you\u2019re going to have just one or a string of them. Now, maybe it\u2019s different with ASD, maybe her tics are stimming, I don\u2019t know, but if she has an actual tic disorder, your advice does not work.", "I mean, it's no \"Tangled\" which actually has good songs.", "Yeah sing along showing of frozen for small children is just not the time to be worried about this its just a non issue for this movie", "THANK YOU! I was so confused by this question. A sing-along movie is definitely not a place OPs child\u2019s vocal tics will be noticed. \n\nI wish OP was far less concerned about how other people react to her daughter and far more concerned about how to mitigate any discomfort her daughter might have in a loud environment. \n\nOP, YTA.", "OP is not a Rocky Horror Picture Show fan.  :)", "That\u2019s brilliant!", "Yeah, this all sounds like the best way to help the daughter, and these are pretty much all strategies OP and Olivia can use in other scenarios also. I'm kind of shocked that OP didn't even mention brining noise cancelling headphones.", "I had a whole other comment typed up before it hit me. Apparently mom missed the message of the first movie.", "So....\n\nShe would have to... Let it go??? \ud83d\ude05", "I've been to the cinema a lot and there have been many times that someone disabled or with some kind of condition/disorder has been loud during the movie. Literally no-one has ever been rude, told them to be quiet, etc. If the person is very loud or is maybe getting a bit too excited or something, the person they're with sometimes takes them out for a bit, then comes back a bit later. Obviously some people suck so I get the worry, but in my experience people understand and are fine with it. It's different to someone talking on their phone or being intentionally annoying.", "I upvoted you, this is lovely!", "My geeky musical theater self is cheering.", "But she gets to have snacks with grandma!  Let Olivia go", "TBH this IS, in fact, what a depressing number of people I have encountered think about autistic people/ people with any kind of mental or developmental disability.", "Ableism starts at home", "100% best solution right here. One parent stays with younger girls, one parent gently takes Olivia back home if she's overstimulated. And she still gets to hang out with Grandma and have her movie night with snacks that way, so having to leave the theater is not seen as a punishment!", "Thank you- there\u2019s a LOT of change happening right now, and so much good coming out of Autistic People taking back control of the discourse, and when parents have been inadvertently railroaded into the old, ableist ideologies about Autistic People, it definitely can be challenging for them to shift away from what they\u2019ve been brainwashed into thinking is gospel. But change can and does happen- it\u2019s challenging, confronting and complex, but 100% worth it!", "If it was a regular movie night I would understand- however this is a specific event geared towards young children, and has a sing a long element incorporated with the movie. I think anyone going to this event would be aware that children can be loud. If it gets excessive compared to the other children around, then OP can take Olivia outside the theatre to manage her tics.", "Absolutely, it\u2019s actually the best time to take a kid who needs a little practice going to movies.", "Same. I wrote a whole comment explaining how OP should do some research on it because it\u2019s actually probably hurting the kid more than helping.", "You hit on a very key point here, which is that OP is teaching their daughter here that her right to exist in the world is reliant on other people's opinions of her. They're directly telling her that they value other people's enjoyment of things like this movie more than they value her own right to enjoy things, and are implicitly teaching her to do the same. This will lead to an adult who is constantly plagued by thoughts like, \"I can't go to this place or do this thing because I would just bother other people due to my disability. I should just stay home.\" In teaching your daughter to cater her presence and behaviors to be more pleasant for everyone but herself, you are teaching her that she has no right to exist in the world the same way as everybody else, unless she adequately masks her disability. \n\nThere will always be people who are intolerant and discriminatory; there will always be people who would rather be irritated and antagonistic by another person's disability than understanding or empathetic. Those people, however, can *choose* to be that way. OP's daughter cannot choose to not be autistic, even if she can be taught to act less autistic. And that's all it will ever be--an *act*. One that will exhaust, limit, hurt, and ostracize your daughter so much more than her disability, which is a major part of *who she is*, ever could.", "Like recently when I went to the movies, I could hear the kids in another theatre room making a racket and I was at the furthest point from the door. \n\nIt was just a normal film like it wasn't a sing a long like these Disney 100 ones.", "That is... an excellent point. \n\nElsa's powers literally kick in when she's excited/overwhelmed/anxious. Olivia is also the oldest sister! Interesting.", "Damn. You\u2019re the sibling I wish I had as an autistic kid. My sib still is embarrassed by me and won\u2019t be seen in public with me.", "The typical guess how tired we are. Not our fault everyone is ablist, yes being a family member might be hard but if people actually listened to autistic and the disability community we wouldn't have this issue would we. Xxx", "Exactly. We stim to regulate ourselves, our emotions and reactions. They\u2019re a natural part of being an autistic person, it sounds like her daughter is in ABA therapy if they\u2019re trying to get her to stop stimming. Which isn\u2019t great, because that\u2019s hurting her more than helping.", "Oh I missed that the first read. Yeah she\u2019s definitely the asshole", "Yeah it's not fair to force your special needs kid on others and ruin their time. fuck man I'm autistic and think that's gross", "It's a kid movie and a sing a long. She'll be fine.", "Ohh, thank you! I dont have autism or know many symptoms so I didnt know.", "It\u2019s a sing along movie. In a theatre full of kids. I don\u2019t think the autistic child would be the disturbance here.", "Yes. If they want a quiet movie night they can do it at home.", "that\u2019s a good plan! and if olivia gets too overwhelmed, she can leave with grandma and do their original plan maybe?", "This is the way!!!", "Autism mom here and this is the answer", "\u201cHey mom, come to the movie with us but if my daughter acts up, you\u2019re responsible for taking her out and missing any parts of the movie during that time.\u201d This AIN\u2019T the way.", "Right? Mom is all \"I don't know how it will go\" because she's never given the kid the opportunity to find out.", "Exactly this. They looked at the opportunity cost and would rather exclude their own kid than risk being embarrassed.", "I also prefer Tangled. And Brave. And Moana. But Frozen is fine, and Citizen Kane (while I guess the camera angles are revolutionary or some shit) is the most overrated film of all time.", "We don't know what her tics are. She could be cursing for all we know.", "She really did. I hope she's found these answers enlightening.\n\nI mean, I just found out sensory friendly screenings are a thing that exists now, though I wish it had sooner. Movies theaters have always been *painfully* loud to me. I was better able to push through it anyway as a teenager but it's gotten worse the older I've got (chronic pain means I won't willingly add more pain if I can avoid it).", "Fuck those people.", "Totally fine if a kid is singing along off key but this would not be the typical noise that you would expect.", "It\u2019s not, it\u2019s more disruptive than normal so it might be more overwhelming", "Its a sing along movie. Everyone will be loud the whole time. This is a completely different type of movie experience.", "Her backup plan is already to have the grandma watch the movie at home with her my point was just have her go with her and if she\u2019s overwhelmed they can go home and do the backup plan instead that way Olivia doesn\u2019t feel excluded but if it\u2019s too much for her and she get overwhelmed she still gets a special evening with her grandma.", "Moana is fire.  Frozen is just mid, but the kids like what they like.  \n\nBut Citizen Kane I thought was actually really enjoyable and I'm far from a film snob, as evidenced by my strong opinion on Disney animated films. I don't care about the camera angles, I just thought it was entertaining!", "Based on OP's words, loud sound system and bright light, which describes pretty much all cinema. So unless the kid has never been to a cinema before, that shouldn't be OP's arguments. All OP cares about was being embarrassed by her. And also, if she starts feeling unwell, her PARENTS will literally be right there to get her outside for a little break.", "But if it goes south they might have to leave and the other 2 kids lose out\n\nI say do a matinee or do it at home", "There are two parents. One can simply take her out of the theater and do something else, if needed. No one loses out except Olivia if she is purposefully excluded BY HER OWN MOTHER."]}
