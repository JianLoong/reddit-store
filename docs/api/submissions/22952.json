Think more about your kids and how to protect them in case you divorce Sam or if you die before him.\n\nJake already inherited from his mother so I don\u2019t see any issue with that. To me it seems fair that kids will inherit their parents, not their step parents (unless they were adopted by step parents).\n\nEdit: I may have misunderstood, maybe Sam divorced years ago but it was last year that his wife died, so it could be that you have a longer relationship with him.

This way he has a place to live and your kids get the house you paid for.", "Not necessarily the asshole, but I don't know your relationship with your stepson. I deal with a lot of families in this situation. If you're close enough to the point where you each think of each other as your own, then cut him in. If you don't, don't. If you're somewhere in between, do something in between. It can cut down on a lot of hurt feelings between his step siblings (assuming he has a good relationship with them now.)\n\nPersonally, I'd suggest some kind of nominal gift, to show that you've recognized him. (Step kids have a general problem of feeling like they belong to neither family, especially if both parents have other kids.) A small gift would go a long way.\n\nIf you don't want to re-write the will, consider a small account with a beneficiary designation or a low value insurance product that you can leave to all the kids, him included. It's more of a symbolic gesture than anything else. \n\nAs for Jake, he's 22. 22YO people aren't well known for being good with money. Hopefully, he learn his lesson once the money runs out. Sometimes, it takes a few tries. At that age, if you've never had a large sum of money, your brain can't compute it. You think your bank account is binary. It's either overdrawn or not. If it's not, you spend. If it is, you stop. When you have a large deposit, the only mental check you have before you spend is, \"am I overdrawn?\" They think of anything over a few dollars as unlimited cash, so they spend until it's overdrawn. No real way to break them of that until they screw it up, firsthand.", "Info: what age was Jake when you first met him? Without knowing tbst, it is impossible to know whether or not you are the asshole. We need to know what sort of role you have played in his life. The fact that this is not included is somewhat suspicious.", "NTA. This is your money to be decided how you feel fit. Jake is not related to you and Sam is welcome to give him a house afterwards if he chooses so. However, I do not follow your logic in including Jake\u2019s inheritance from his mother in your calculations. The same way as Jake is not related to you, his other inheritance is none of your business. It does not make you an A though", "I mean I would leave my husband's kid something even if he blew money he had before simply because that's what I'd do for my biological children. I can see how someone would mess up money like that after losing a parent I imagine he was trying to fill the void and distract himself. You can do what you want but I disagree with the its not your kid view in comments to me when you marry someone with kids those kids are now yours too. If you don't give anything it should be because he blew money before not because he's not your biological child.", "YTA. Your stepson is part of your family.
