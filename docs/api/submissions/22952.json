It can cut down on a lot of hurt feelings between his step siblings (assuming he has a good relationship with them now.)\n\nPersonally, I'd suggest some kind of nominal gift, to show that you've recognized him.

Sometimes, it takes a few tries. At that age, if you've never had a large sum of money, your brain can't compute it. You think your bank account is binary. It's either overdrawn or not. If it's not, you spend. If it is, you stop. When you have a large deposit, the only mental check you have before you spend is, \"am I overdrawn?\" They think of anything over a few dollars as unlimited cash, so they spend until it's overdrawn. No real way to break them of that until they screw it up, firsthand.", "Info: what age was Jake when you first met him?

That's why I said it would normally be a good compromise, but not in this case since Sam sucks with money.", "That's basically what I meant. I just worded it poorly.
