My cousins however had pretty comfortable lives. They excluded us from things. All my childhood I had to watch my cousins go to restaurants, cafes and other places and they never invited me or my little sister (16) because they knew we couldn't afford it. I know I wasn't entitled to their money but it hurt because  my aunts and uncles could easily afford to invite us at least once in our lives and pay for it but they never did. Because of this my sister and I aren't close to them since we never got the chance to bond with them.\n\nAs I said now I have a high paying job and I still live with my parents so I don't have any bills or rent to pay and I've been able to save a good amount of money. My cousins(who are mostly adults now) planned a trip last week and this time my sister and I were invited because we can finally afford it.\n\nHowever turned out that most of them are no longer being supported by their parents and they don't have high paying jobs so they were in a tight budget. I was disappointed when I heard the trips plan because they wanted to go by bus, get a few rooms in a cheap hotel and only eat homemade food, go to cheap places etc.\n\nI agreed to go with them because my sister wanted to go however I decided since my sister and I were neved a part of their group we don't have to be a part of it now either. I got plane tickets for both of us and reserved a room in a nice hotel. We still spent time with them for example we would buy our food and join them so we can all eat at the same time and we joined them on some of the activities that they planned however there were some activities that we wanted to do that they couldn't afford so we couldn't be together all the time.\n\nMy sister and I had a blast in our trip however after we returned home one of my cousins called me and told me I'm a jerk for seperating me and my sister from everyone else like that and apparently my sister has been bragging about our trip and making some of the younger cousins upset", "created_utc": 1693143329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162qltm/aita_for_separating_me_and_my_sister_from/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not your cousins fault they grew up in more well off situations nor is it their fault you were never invited. This is an aunt and uncle problem.\n\nDid your cousins used to brag like your sister is doing? Cause your sister is definitely being a dick especially since she didn't pay for squat on this trip I'm assuming. And she is bragging to the younger cousins.\n\nYou have every right to have the trip you guys wanted. But honestly to just go with your cousins for the sake of being petty is a waste of time and childish.", "It sounds like there's a disconnect here. You definitely come across as envious of their upbringing and you and your sister definitely rubbed the reversal of fortune in their faces.\n\nIf you want a relationship with your cousins then you should talk to them about everything - how you felt then about being excluded, what their expectations were in inviting you now you've \"made it\" etc. If you don't want a relationship with them, fine but that's your decision for good or for bad.\n\nYTA for your attitude though.", "Feels a little petty TBH like you intentionally decided to rub their faces in it.\n\nDoesn't seem to me like growing up it was on your cousins (who were also kids) to make things right.  I'm going with YTA downvotes be damned!", "Info\n\nWhy are you punishing your cousins for what thier parents did?\n\nDoing this makes you no better than them, actually I think you'd be worse.", "YTA \n\nThe cousins didn\u2019t exclude you when you were younger. Their parents did. \n\nYour cousins were thoughtful enough to include you in a cousins trip. You intentionally excluded them. If you didn\u2019t want to go on vacation with them, why didn\u2019t you plan your own trip? \n\nDon\u2019t expect to be included on any future trips without a sincere apology.", "I can tell by how you talk that YTA.", "You purposefully made sure your cousins knew that you have more money then them because you're holding a grudge over something you were never entitled to. YTA", "Your cousins are annoyed you didn\u2019t include them and pay for their experiences just as you\u2019re upset your aunt and uncle didn\u2019t pay for you to join them when you were a teenager. If you feel you should have been Included then, then you should understand why your cousins want to be included now. It\u2019s the same thing.", "NTA, if you only went because of your sister. You have higher standards now than when you were a kid and can afford said standards, you shouldn't have to reduce them for anyone. It's good you treated your little sister to a semblance of the highlife she didn't have.", "YTA. When you\u2019re invited on a trip, it\u2019s assumed that you\u2019re going together. Why not plan your own trip next time?", "YTA - it doesn\u2019t sound like they ever said they were upset before you didn\u2019t pay for them. It sounds like they were upset you separated yourself from them and you have to get that it was a dick move to go on a group trip and then wander off. Why not just take your sister on your own? \n\nIt reads like you are carrying a grudge from childhood and wanted to get back at them.", "def not the AH,\n\nThey only wanted you to come because you have money, they were phishing for you to pay for it and are now upset because you and your sis had some cash and treated yourselves.", "ESH - They we\u2019re TA for not including you when you were younger. You are TA for going on this trip to, it sounds like, rub in their faces that you were doing better than them.", ">after we returned home one of my cousins called me and told me I'm a jerk for seperating me and my sister from everyone\n\nIt sounds like you and your sister weren't close to your cousins anyway. You and sis had a blast. They're jealous. Who cares? Live your life. NTA. \n\nBesides, you're not required to do everything with your cousins while on holiday.  Sometimes, one person loves churches, and their travel companion is contemplating stabbing them in the eye if they have to go to one more church. Part of growing up is accepting that people like to do different things.  You still hung out with them.", "You\u2019re adults, if you want to stay at a nicer place you can. end of story. NTA", "NTA good job for showing your sister how family should really be. You gave her something she deserved not a low budget vacation because the people who planned it didn\u2019t save enough of their money", "Nta!  Great job on your success", "NTA. They were hoping you would help pay for their trip.   Put all the childhood trauma/drama aside. They are adults and should not expect anyone else to pay their way.  \n\nI would suggest, however, that you begin contributing to your family\u2019s household expenses. If you are a self supporting adult who can afford to take nice vacations you should be paying rent.", "INFO: I don\u2019t understand how you see the situations as the same, but it\u2019s possible I\u2019m not understanding the scenario. \n\n1) A planned trip together is different than just daily life. Like on a vacation together, there\u2019s an expectation that you\u2019ll do things together. In your regular life, there\u2019s not a general expectation to eat every meal together. So while I get that it\u2019s shitty your aunt and uncle never thought to treat and include you, it also isn\u2019t like you would have expected to eat with them any time they were going out. So the vacation feels different. \n\n2) it was your aunt and uncle who excluded you. In one comment you say your cousins chose the restaurants, but that still doesn\u2019t make sense. It doesn\u2019t sound like their choices were \u201ccheaper meal with your cousins or expensive meal without your cousins\u201d and the kids chose the latter. But maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding?\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019re TA for not feeling a need to include your cousins but it does feel like you\u2019re taking out your (justifiable) anger on the wrong people given what you\u2019ve said.", "Honestly my judgment meter's all over the place. I'm honestly bouncing between ESH and NAH but could also make the case for NTA and YTA. Whuff.\n\nSo rather than throw in a verdict, I will just advise you that you may be doing a bit too much mind-reading (in the cognitive distortion sense). \n\nI think if your assumptions that they intentionally chose expensive restaurants when they were younger as a means to exclude you for being poor, and that they only invited you on their trip because you now have money, are true, then yes maybe you were a bit petty about it but you wouldn't be an ass.\n\nHowever, these are *assumptions* you're making about their intentions and you need to be careful about this kind of bias. You do it, I do it, we all do it, it's part of being human and having theory of mind but it can also get out of hand and breed resentment unnecessarily.\n\nI'm not saying one way or the other if your cousins were actually thinking this way. I just suggest you consider how your actions might come across if these assumptions turned out to *not* be true.\n\nETA: Your aunt and uncle do suck for this though, and you have every right to be bitter about that part.", "Nta, you worked your way to afford those luxuries,  they didn't.  Oh well", "NTA. You treated your sister to a fun vacation. Nothing wrong with that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
