You were basically trying to balance out the scales.\n\nNow that your grandson is turning 18 though, perhaps you can readjust your position.  Not doing anything for your grandson at this point might be going a bit too far.  I'm not saying you should get him a car, but perhaps you can offer to match whatever he can gather.  So if he gathers 2000 for a car, you'll put in 2000 (if you have the means to do this).  Or you can offer to help him out with car insurance, or even take the kid out to dinner once a month.  Try to be a good influence on his life, and maybe even explain to him why you were so distant.  How do you know the favoritism hasn't also bothered him?   At least get to know the kid and see where you might be able to help him out while staying in your comfort zone.\n\nPlease keep showing Laura all that love since she apparently isn't getting it from her parent(s). I think she probably needs it.  It's very hurtful for a kid to see their parent(s) show all their love for one kid while ignoring the other.   Encourage her to achieve great heights.   Explain to her that her success will be the thing that makes her parent(s) regret their past decisions of not showing equal love to both kids.  But try not to be exactly like them.  Offer at least some support to the grandson as well, so that he isn't feeling rejected completely by you.\n\nBest of luck OP.", "INFO: How is any of this Jonah's fault?", "NTA, someone needs to show Laura she is loved", "NTA\n\nYou!!!

Which, if that's the case, is unfair to Laura. \n\nProbably telling Dad that OP is not helping Dad buy a car for anyone but is open to talk with Jonah if they can do something is a better choice, given that we have no indication that Dad even cared if Laura had a job or not (at least at 16).", "For thinking his parents shouldn't have treated hkm like an only child?", "No-he really hates his daughter-in-law.

My birthday is in August, this is back when Harry Potter books would be released end of July. I insisted that she get to read them first. (But she's a really slow reader who usually fell asleep by 10 pm and I'm something of a night owl so I usually managed to catch up overnight! Because who can wait for Harry Potter!) \n\nNot the point, anyways...what I'm trying to say is, Jonah is 18. If he doesn't realise that his parents are treating his sister like she isn't worth shit, then either he is stupider than 'the treasonous pumpkin' or he enjoys the special treatment and really doesn't care about her. In which case, OP owes him less than nothing.", "I'd argue then that the appropriate thing would be to care for Laura more, but from OP's post I get the impression that he doesn't care for Jonah AT ALL as a way of punishing the parents for neglecting Laura. That's not how you treat a grandchild.

Why in the world does she need a babysitter?", "You've never seen how vindictive grandparents can be when they don't like one of the parents.

My grandma didn't like her and used to talk mad shit about my mom to my sister and I to try and make us hate her. Told us when we were little that our parents thought we were mistakes and made us believe that our mom didn't want us so we wouldn't recognize how abusive my grandma's actions were. And OP's words are reminding me a lot of my own grandma.", "Yeah, OP should talk to the kid. He's old enough to understand it. The kids' parents are useless to both Jonah and Laura.

Even so, I don\u2019t think it would hurt to assist Jonah as grandparents if they can afford it. Maybe offer to let him work to earn a percentage and then cover the rest as they did with Laura.

The question is if he is an AH for not buying a car for a child he has little to no relationship with and the answer is no.  You are not obligated to provide for a grandchild in that way if you want to it is nice but not obligated.  He provided for his grand daughter because he has that type of relationship with her.  We don't know if the grandson has ever even tried to have a relationship with him.   If we knew the grandson had tried and he rejected him sure that is an AH move but that isn't the question.
