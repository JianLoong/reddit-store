You were basically trying to balance out the scales.\n\nNow that your grandson is turning 18 though, perhaps you can readjust your position.  Not doing anything for your grandson at this point might be going a bit too far.  I'm not saying you should get him a car, but perhaps you can offer to match whatever he can gather.  So if he gathers 2000 for a car, you'll put in 2000 (if you have the means to do this).  Or you can offer to help him out with car insurance, or even take the kid out to dinner once a month.  Try to be a good influence on his life, and maybe even explain to him why you were so distant.  How do you know the favoritism hasn't also bothered him?   At least get to know the kid and see where you might be able to help him out while staying in your comfort zone.\n\nPlease keep showing Laura all that love since she apparently isn't getting it from her parent(s). I think she probably needs it.  It's very hurtful for a kid to see their parent(s) show all their love for one kid while ignoring the other.   Encourage her to achieve great heights.   Explain to her that her success will be the thing that makes her parent(s) regret their past decisions of not showing equal love to both kids.  But try not to be exactly like them.  Offer at least some support to the grandson as well, so that he isn't feeling rejected completely by you.\n\nBest of luck OP.", "INFO: How is any of this Jonah's fault?", "NTA, someone needs to show Laura she is loved", "NTA\n\nYou!!!

How entitled do you have to be to think that not getting a car is neglect?", "Grandson has two parents, granddaughter has 2 parents.", "* me \n* too", "I didn\u2019t see those details. Then yeah, that absolutely tips the scales.", "* I also want in. \n* I hope it works.\n* Yay!", "He said that in some comments he made to people. It very much comes across that the parents treat Jonah as an only child, and he and his wife have basically had Laura living with them since she was 11. \nEdit: to add his reply below. \n\nYou think I'll ever take them both out and make Jonah pay for himself?", "One of the comments in here basically said OP not getting Jonah a car was neglect. That's a special level of entitlement right there.", "\"you say it Hitler's everyone is untrue\" ???", "Nowhere does it say he tears him badly it just says he didn\u2019t also buy him a car. He told the parents he wouldn\u2019t contribute to his basic needs which they should be doing alone anyway .", "It doesn't. But I never made the claim that OP is the only asshole in this story.", "It's also NOT Jonah's fault. Why should he be punished?", "The wife was neglecting the daughter based on what obviously biased word of this grandparent that shouldn't be a grandparent. The only real evidence of lacking parenting is that he claims that she hold the son more than the daughter well there's myriad reasons why that could have been that had nothing to do with neglect. You're basing your belief that they're neglectful parents on an obviously biased individuals selectively given story as to why they choose their granddaughter over the grandson to spoil and buy things for which is a real shitty thing for a grandparent to do whether they like the mother or not whether they agree with the parenting styles or not they should treat both kids equally they should love both kids equally it's so wrong for them to neglect ignore whatever you want to call it the grandson and spoil the shit out of the granddaughter the boy didn't do anything wrong it's not his fault.", "I'm wondering if there was some postpartum depression going on. It can be hard to connect with a baby and can last years after birth.", "Op does not sound like a reliable narrator. If he didn't like the son or her partner, it's unlikely they were spending enough time to know which child she pays more attention to.", "This is an opinion from someone who already dislikes their DIL. How do we know the DIL wasn\u2019t working through some PP issues? I love my 3rd baby but man, she broke me in so many ways. It took me a good bit of therapy after her birth to feel connected like I did with my others. The second pregnancy is rough, ppd is hell, and judgmental comments from in laws don\u2019t help.", "This story is very obviously biased. I dont trust what OP is saying at sll. Except that their showing severe favoritism to one grandchild", "These are people who think you are a terrible parent who should have never had children if you don't own a home big enough for each child to have their own bedroom and private bathroom."]}
