You were basically trying to balance out the scales.\n\nNow that your grandson is turning 18 though, perhaps you can readjust your position.  Not doing anything for your grandson at this point might be going a bit too far.  I'm not saying you should get him a car, but perhaps you can offer to match whatever he can gather.  So if he gathers 2000 for a car, you'll put in 2000 (if you have the means to do this).  Or you can offer to help him out with car insurance, or even take the kid out to dinner once a month.  Try to be a good influence on his life, and maybe even explain to him why you were so distant.  How do you know the favoritism hasn't also bothered him?   At least get to know the kid and see where you might be able to help him out while staying in your comfort zone.\n\nPlease keep showing Laura all that love since she apparently isn't getting it from her parent(s). I think she probably needs it.  It's very hurtful for a kid to see their parent(s) show all their love for one kid while ignoring the other.   Encourage her to achieve great heights.   Explain to her that her success will be the thing that makes her parent(s) regret their past decisions of not showing equal love to both kids.  But try not to be exactly like them.  Offer at least some support to the grandson as well, so that he isn't feeling rejected completely by you.\n\nBest of luck OP.", "INFO: How is any of this Jonah's fault?", "NTA, someone needs to show Laura she is loved", "NTA\n\nYou!!!

Your saying the things that they get should be equal. If one gets this or that, then the other should get the equivalent. Thts true. Him buying her a car and Jonah not having one is unbalanced but I think if he were to give Jonah the same thing he gives her then it defeats the purpose.

I would say if OP buys Laura something then the parents should buy Jonah the equivalent and if they can afford it.
