I get home from work today at 3pm and she asks me to take the baby.

It was an interviewer and he wanted to do an over the phone interview and asked if it was a good time. I said yes.\n\nAbout 40 minutes later I go back in and my wife is cooking dinner with the baby strapped to her chest. I said I could take the baby now and she said \"looks like I've got it\" and dismisses me completely. She then turns off the stove (dinner was done) and goes in to the bathroom with the baby and takes a shower, with the baby. I go in and say she's being ridiculous and that I had to take a phone call and she snapped. She said \"I take phone calls while holding the baby all the fucking time. I cook, clean, shower, shit and shave while holding the baby. Your excuse is pathetic.\" AITA for not taking the baby immediately?\n\nETA: our daughter just had her vaccinations. She's fussy.

Simple as that. \n\nAnd then after being gone for 40 minutes and seeing she is upset, you follow her to the bathroom and tell her she is being ridiculous. Dude, you left her when you said you would help for 40 minutes with zero consideration or communication, and she is the ridiculous one?", "Info:  Did you explain to your wife you were going to have a phone interview before it started or after?", "Soft YTA. I get that a job interview is important and I also get that you wanted to be seen by the interviewer as accommodating, but a better way to handle this would have been to ask the interviewer to hold on for a minute while you checked with your wife whether it was okay to proceed. You had no idea how her day had gone and where she was at mentally/emotionally in that moment, and at 7 weeks postpartum she and your child should be your main priority. By not looping her in on what was going on, she had no idea what was so important about the call and felt you were being dismissive of her and how rough her day was. She was no doubt exhausted, touched out, and at the end of the rope, and instead of giving her the respite she needed and expected when you walked in the door, you dismissed her and gave her 40 minutes to stew about it. \n\nFYI, i\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt on this, but the fact that she is a SAHM should only be relevant to the fact that she had been stuck at home all day.

I don't know whether it would have helped with her apparently at her wits end, but it just lets her know that it was more important than just any old phone call. You should really try giving her an afternoon/night completely off if you can. Not just hold the baby while she's cooking, like an actual evening of no baby/cooking/house duties. It sounds like she really needs it. You have to keep in mind that you have zero baby duties while at work, and zero work duties once you are home. She probably has very little time with absolutely *no* duties when she can just completely relax. Like, even your commute probably sounds like heaven to her. Half an hour or whatever in the car with no one bothering her to just listen to music and be alone with her thoughts? Absolute *heaven* for a new mother. It's a long road. Don't let her burn out this early.", "How difficult would it have been to say to the interviewer \u201cI just walked in the door, can I put you on hold for one minute whilst I let me wife know I\u2019ll be occupied for a bit?\u201d As somebody who has interviewed and hired people in her professional life, that would have been a point in your favor.

You probably both are stressed.\n\nThe right way to handle this was to a) tell the interviewer \"hang on a second, I just walked into my home\", b) tell her it's a job interview and does she still want you to take the baby (\"yes, I really need to hand her off now\"), c) take the baby and get back to the interviewer saying you can talk if he or she is ok with you holding your newborn, or if they prefer, reschedule/offer to call them back once the baby has settled. Or if you want to not hold a baby while interviewing, tell her right away (\"I feel like I should focus fully on the interview - the job sounded really great, so if you want me to take her now, I'll try to reschedule\").", "Does the baby never get put down for awhile in a crib? Playpen? Bassinet? Nap? Etc? Just wondering..", "YTA. Use your words and explain that it was for a job interview. It's understandable that you were worried about missing the opportunity.

If you're trying to get a better job for your family, taking an interview when asked is good for all of you.  But a half second to tell your wife would have been a lot more considerate.

Clear communication in the future will help. Ask your interviewer to hold for one moment. Tell your wife it's a job interview and you will be able to hold baby shortly.

Does she want you to advance in your career? It was an interview it's not like you stood there and talked to a friend for 40 minutes and goofing off. You had a legitimate call.

You may be comfortable now but raises are scarce and babies add up FAST. I don't care how tired your wife was- sometimes sacrifices need to be made for the good of the family and not passing up an interview for a better paying position is more important than LESS THAN AN HOUR of holding the baby. She had an emotional response which is understandable, but if she doesn't apologize for the overreaction later she's the AH. Reddit is a cesspool of chronically online people that don't understand how actual human interpersonal relationships work and this was not a good place to ask for an objective opinion", "YTA for agreeing to take the baby and then not communicating to your wife when that plan changed.\n\nThough it really sounds like this is not a one-time issue and you should talk to your wife about why this was a breaking point for her. It could be as simple as having a long day with a fussy baby and not getting the break she needed, or there could be a deeper issue where something you do is letting her down and this was just a straw that broke the camel\u2019s back kind of thing.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve had a newborn AND spent 10 years working in hiring for various levels of jobs, so \u2014 no, most newborns can\u2019t be set down for long (if you think that, you\u2019re probably thinking of babies over 4 months old who are more independent), and most jobs will absolutely reschedule an interview.

Unless you are being specifically head hunted, most interviewers have multiple applicants that are all about the same in terms of viability. They have no need to wait on the convenience of your normal applicant to be available. Taking a phone call from your mum or to a friend is very different to an interview call. Having a baby being distracting or worse, start crying is not going to project \"competent professional\". Some interviewers might be forgiving but a lot are not. The average person has enough competition against them for good, high paying positions without sabotaging their first impression. NTA. It sounds like your wife could use some recharge time though if she is normally a reasonable person. And yes, I was a SAHM for many years. I know exactly how tough it is.

You prioritised something you felt was important but your wife had a different opinion. Hey guess what, this is going to happen A LOT. Her day to day life has massively changed being a SAHM and yours much less so. Your priorities will naturally be different.

You may be planning on using that money for fun, but you know what never hurts when you have children, is a little more money. Cause kids are expensive.

If she wants to have a shower without the baby, roll the bloody bassinet into the bath room and put the kid in there and have a shower, at 7 weeks old she isn\u2019t going anywhere.", "YTA not for not taking the baby right away, it's reasonable for you to answer a call about a job interview. But you're an asshole for saying she's \"being ridiculous\" because it was obviously frustrating for her to not have a break at that moment. \n\nYou prioritized being \"right\" about the phone call over understanding and caring for your wife. An apology for the situation and an acknowledgement of her status of \"can't turn it off\" parent would have gone a long way.", "NTA. In this job market you need to take an interview when offered. Anyone saying that they would have called back isn\u2019t being realists. And your wife should understand that in order for her to have the luxury of being a SAHM you need to have a second job. \nI was a SAHM when we had our twins and our oldest was turning 2 years old. So I had a toddler and newborn twins who were EBF. \nI understand how stressful it is. But if my husband was getting a second job to help support the family, I would not have been so unreasonable with him.", "NAH and people that are saying otherwise probably never had a job. The only thing you could have done different was say \u201cgive me a minute to get to a quiet place\u201d and let your wife know what was happening. She could have done something else for 45 minutes and handed you the baby after. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to pass on an interview. The job market largely stinks right now. You don\u2019t want a baby screaming through it. Taking the call was the best for all of you. And it was 3 pm.

You did what seemed right to you at the time, and your wife understood it as her being ignored. You both are partially wrong. As a former manager in charge of new hires, if you had blown me off I would have continued down my list and not bothered with you. You were right to take the phone call.\n\nHowever, you didn't communicate to your wife the importance of the call. She felt let down and ignored. Use this as a learning opportunity for communication skills.\n\nMy last bit of advice, it's entirely ok to put the baby down and let it cry for a few minutes.

So hold the baby.", "I'm going to go with NTA. You got an important call, one which will directly impact your ability to provide for your family. People here saying that you could have rescheduled have a very optimistic view of the job hiring process. IMO you have to strike while the iron is hot, maybe the next prospect IS available and oh they are a perfect fit, oh and they can start Monday? Bye bye better job. Your wife saying she can take a phone call with the baby is a false equivalency, you needed to give a professional tone and focused attention to this call, which don't include a baby. You offered your wife a break as soon as you were able, and I think that is the most you can be asked for in this situation. When you guys aren't so upset with each though, it may be worth sitting down and figuring out ways to lighten your wife's load, maybe she would like a rule that as soon as you come in you are on baby duty, maybe you need to start cooking dinner, whatever. Good luck.", "NAH. You should have communicated the call was important before walking off, and certainly after you agreed to the interview and knew the call would be a while. \n\nBut having a 7 week old is being in the trenches big time.

You\u2019re going to have squabbles like this, but as long as you communicate and work through stuff you will be fine.", "NTA - I just had my baby and we've had disagreements or miscommunication. I would recommend to apologize and ask what you can do better or differently next time.

You happ3ned to get the interview call at that moment, then I 100% understand that was more important at that moment. Yes it sucks, so apologize and make it up to the wife.

But, when with a very upset baby, you ha e to put them down sometimes, especially if you are overwhelmed", "NTA, no one is TA here -- your wife is feeling extremely overwhelmed and deserves sympathy and support. I would have asked the recruiter if I could call back in 20 minutes, this always works and you can do this next time. Your focus on your income was NOT wrong, but you can still learn and grow from this experience and realize your wife MUST have that break when you get home. It's vital, especially with the baby being fussy. If your baby can handle walks in carrier or stroller without being fussy I would have tried to make that happen before calling back your recruiter. \n\nYou should also know there is a HUGE double-standard here that you can exploit as a male. \"I'm here with my baby, sorry if she's fussy as she's just had her shots\" is something I could absolutely never say/do in a professional setting because I look like a woman who will split my attention between my family and my work. Men do it all the time at my job though -- I love admiring their babies but mine are only visible when sick or truly melting down.", "NTA, a phone interview to better the lives of your entire family, is definitely #1 priority.

You get a phone call and tell her one second. Upon realizing the call was going to take awhile, you TELL your wife it's an important call for a job interview. Boom.

And then you take the baby from your wife.\n\nInstead, from her perspective: you came home, she asked you to take the baby. you agreed, but told her one second. She's exhausted from caring for baby all. day. long. You then take a phone call about who knows what and disappear for 40 minutes.

My husband stays home with the baby and, despite how exhausted he is, has always been supportive of me taking interviews *because I communicate and I keep his needs in mind when scheduling those calls*. In fact, wherever possible, I took interview calls during my work day specifically so that it wouldn't impact my time at home. \n\nWhat a lot of sole providers don't realize is the time you take the baby is *the only down time the primary parent gets* and is usually used for basic maintenancelike eating, showering,  and sleeping so it's not really down time. And this only gets worse as the kid gets older. I can nearly guarantee you are not working as hard as she is during the day. I certainly don't work as hard as my husband does. Babies are fucking exhausting, especially at this early stage when she's either not on a schedule yet or the schedule changes as soon as it's been established. \n\nYour wife likely feels under appreciated, unseen, and under cared for while being expected to take on this new challenge of parenting, mostly on her own. I would encourage you to take a few days to do her job,  the way she does it, without her there to help or guide you so you can fully understand and appreciate what she's going through because a few hours in the evening and on weekends does not at all compare to the work she's putting in during the days.", "ESH.

There's obviously going to be stress, exhaustion and some hiccups along the way, it's inevitable. \n\nHowever, I feel like your communication could use a scootch of improvement OP. You told your wife \"one moment\" but then didn't clarify that it would be longer after finding out it was an interview (a task that usually takes a longer time to complete). While there's absolutely nothing wrong with taking the interview in the moment, and I'm sure your wife would understand, I feel like you owed her an explanation beyond \"I had to take a call\". This makes it sound a bit like your priorities come first regardless of her needs and like you don't feel that you need to explain yourself to her. \n\nIf something like this comes up again, I would recommend saying \"one moment\" while you answer the phone, but then asking the interviewer/other party to give you a moment so that you can let your wife know. You can word it to the interviewer that you want to make sure you aren't interrupted if you're worried about professionalism. This helps to clarify needs on both sides and also helps to establish a possible timeline for when those needs will be met (most adults are familiar with an interview process so you being 40 minutes wouldn't be unexpected).\n\nJust remember to work with your wife and that a little communication goes a long way!\n\nETA: Your wife isn't in the wrong here either for being angry and lashing out against you. Also, telling her she's being ridiculous is *not* going to help. You're understandably upset at her reaction, but this goes back to the communication piece. Talk to each other, figure out each other's needs and work out a routine that works for you. She's probably burnt out/touched out as heck right now. Try helping her with baby-free time, ask if there's anything she would like you to do to take a couple things off of her plate, or just jump in to lighten her load and give her a break wherever you can.

You don't take that call I'm calling the next person on my list, because the only reason why you got a call, and they didn't is because they made a typo but it's not going to affect the job and I can schedule the interviews and go home without having to make follow up calls the next day.", "No, handling the baby who is already fussy during an interview is not right.

OP\u2019s wife certainly deserves a break the second he gets home, and I\u2019m sure she was looking forward to being able to hand off the baby after a long and hard day. She was reacting to not having enough information about why he was taking that phone call. They are new parents who are still trying to figure out life with a baby and how to do it together. They both are probably really tired and sleep deprived. OP\u2019s wife is more so because she is doing something new to her versus her husband just going about his normal day and continuing his work he is already familiar with. So I think with grace from both of them for each other, the situation would have been easier to navigate. It does not feel to me that either one of them was being willfully, uncooperative or mean.

Obviously the timing sucked and is out of his control but it's also pretty obvious that's not why she's upset. It just happened to be the phone call that was the catalyst. She's 7 weeks pp with her first kid and is probably overwhelmed as fuck", "Depending on the baby, I am sure a screaming baby in the background would have made that interview go really smoothly.", "I am upvoting you because people really need to start understanding that babies - even newborns - CAN be put down.

Some otherwise healthy babies do, too.

Sorry I can't help until we are done\" and then continue the call. This is NOT a difficult situation to manage. Also, employers calling for interviews around dinner time know it is a bad time. They are either testing to see if you will work in the evening, or they should understand if it is a bad time...

Unfortunately even with reputable and good workplaces, declining an interview is not taken well so while I agree with workplaces needing to be more accommodating, I know for a fact that it\u2019s rarely the case.", "I\u2019m sorry to each their own but I would take the baby a while longer if it means encouraging my husband towards a potentially good opportunity that I would end up benefit me and my child and give us a better quality of life. I appreciate the need for a break, but we need to think long term as a couple and what\u2019s best for our child and their upbringing. It just does not make any sense to me that I would get mad at my husband for taking an interview call even if I\u2019m tired and have been holding this child all day. Family comes first, but he IS putting his family first by job hunting and taking interviews. And yeah, they might leave a voicemail, but I don\u2019t see the issue with him taking the call on the spot.", "Eh I wouldn\u2019t give a firm answer before asking. She could still be having post partum or anything else, and she could REALLY have needed a break.

Your wife being able to cook/clean/shower/shave/take a phone call/etc without a baby strapped to her is not important (to you). \n\nWhat would you deem important enough to take over childcare from your wife? Would she need to lose a limb or something? If she were lying dead on the kitchen floor do you think you could manage to hold your infant *and* call 911?

You could have easily scheduled a better time to speak with the interviewer instead of spending *40 minutes* on the phone, knowing full well your wife is overwhelmed/exhausted/on-call 24/7. \n\nAlso, she shouldn\u2019t have to ask for your help. You should be parenting, not helping her parent. \n\nSince work is so important to you, imagine you\u2019re a nurse working at a hospital.

There is a lot of competition for jobs in that pay range, so companies can afford to be picky.\n\nOne of the ways to advance your career and increase your salary is to move companies. Once you're locked into a job, you're locked into their compensation strategy, which if you're lucky is 2-3% raise per year. Looking for a new job while his current one meets their needs is smart. It's better to do it now before they reach the point where he has to hustle or she has to go back to work.\n\nDude should have told his wife what the call was about and had a quick powwow with her to see if it's worth it to take the interview.

I\u2019ve been in the job hunting process and I\u2019ll tell you that you just can\u2019t say that this time isn\u2019t good. \n\nThere was no need for the wife to act like a martyr. We know being a SAHM is difficult. It\u2019s a sacrifice for sure. \n\nBut she could have waited rather than making dinner right then. She could have sat down with the baby and waited for him to finish his job interview. \n\nIt\u2019s not like he was off playing video games or out drinking with his buddies. He was having a job interview, after working a full day, to help his family out. \n\nI stand by my initial assessment of NTA.", "Yup. It\u2019s stress. Financial. Lack of sleep. Life changes.

I am not undermining that. \n\nA bouncy or something in the same room while you shower quick or use the toilet is a practical and reasonable solution.

Plan better.", "That makes a bit more sense, especially with the recent shots.", "So what did your wife say when you took the call, explaining to her how important the interview (in a quiet space) was, and guaranteeing you\u2019d take your daughter as soon as you were done?", "These guys are wrong you are an asshole you treated your partner like shit. You need to apologise at the very least.", "I get her being upset about it. But to outright refuse and not take the break offered? To not understand that you take the interview when offered? She was just being unreasonable.", "I think it's NAH. \n\nI've been in OP's wife's shoes. My second was an unhappy baby who couldn't be put down. Well, he could, but he would cry so hard he threw up. It is *exhausting* and it's so difficult when you feel like you can't get a break. She must be completely overwhelmed, as you said, which is why she snapped and then took the baby with her to shower. \n\nOn the other hand, OP had a job interview. That's a big deal.

I read that as hes finding a new, better paying job.", "Yeah that's fair.

Is it ok if I take this call downstairs, and then I'll take the baby out on a walk?\" They have only been parents for 7 weeks and this kind of communication is a skill that can take awhile to learn.
