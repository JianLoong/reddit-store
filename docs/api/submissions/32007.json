I get home from work today at 3pm and she asks me to take the baby.

It was an interviewer and he wanted to do an over the phone interview and asked if it was a good time. I said yes.\n\nAbout 40 minutes later I go back in and my wife is cooking dinner with the baby strapped to her chest. I said I could take the baby now and she said \"looks like I've got it\" and dismisses me completely. She then turns off the stove (dinner was done) and goes in to the bathroom with the baby and takes a shower, with the baby. I go in and say she's being ridiculous and that I had to take a phone call and she snapped. She said \"I take phone calls while holding the baby all the fucking time. I cook, clean, shower, shit and shave while holding the baby. Your excuse is pathetic.\" AITA for not taking the baby immediately?\n\nETA: our daughter just had her vaccinations. She's fussy.

Simple as that. \n\nAnd then after being gone for 40 minutes and seeing she is upset, you follow her to the bathroom and tell her she is being ridiculous. Dude, you left her when you said you would help for 40 minutes with zero consideration or communication, and she is the ridiculous one?", "Info:  Did you explain to your wife you were going to have a phone interview before it started or after?", "Soft YTA. I get that a job interview is important and I also get that you wanted to be seen by the interviewer as accommodating, but a better way to handle this would have been to ask the interviewer to hold on for a minute while you checked with your wife whether it was okay to proceed. You had no idea how her day had gone and where she was at mentally/emotionally in that moment, and at 7 weeks postpartum she and your child should be your main priority. By not looping her in on what was going on, she had no idea what was so important about the call and felt you were being dismissive of her and how rough her day was. She was no doubt exhausted, touched out, and at the end of the rope, and instead of giving her the respite she needed and expected when you walked in the door, you dismissed her and gave her 40 minutes to stew about it. \n\nFYI, i\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt on this, but the fact that she is a SAHM should only be relevant to the fact that she had been stuck at home all day.

I don't know whether it would have helped with her apparently at her wits end, but it just lets her know that it was more important than just any old phone call. You should really try giving her an afternoon/night completely off if you can. Not just hold the baby while she's cooking, like an actual evening of no baby/cooking/house duties. It sounds like she really needs it. You have to keep in mind that you have zero baby duties while at work, and zero work duties once you are home. She probably has very little time with absolutely *no* duties when she can just completely relax. Like, even your commute probably sounds like heaven to her. Half an hour or whatever in the car with no one bothering her to just listen to music and be alone with her thoughts? Absolute *heaven* for a new mother. It's a long road. Don't let her burn out this early.", "How difficult would it have been to say to the interviewer \u201cI just walked in the door, can I put you on hold for one minute whilst I let me wife know I\u2019ll be occupied for a bit?\u201d As somebody who has interviewed and hired people in her professional life, that would have been a point in your favor.

You probably both are stressed.\n\nThe right way to handle this was to a) tell the interviewer \"hang on a second, I just walked into my home\", b) tell her it's a job interview and does she still want you to take the baby (\"yes, I really need to hand her off now\"), c) take the baby and get back to the interviewer saying you can talk if he or she is ok with you holding your newborn, or if they prefer, reschedule/offer to call them back once the baby has settled. Or if you want to not hold a baby while interviewing, tell her right away (\"I feel like I should focus fully on the interview - the job sounded really great, so if you want me to take her now, I'll try to reschedule\").", "Does the baby never get put down for awhile in a crib? Playpen? Bassinet? Nap? Etc? Just wondering..", "YTA. Use your words and explain that it was for a job interview. It's understandable that you were worried about missing the opportunity.

If you're trying to get a better job for your family, taking an interview when asked is good for all of you.  But a half second to tell your wife would have been a lot more considerate.

Clear communication in the future will help. Ask your interviewer to hold for one moment. Tell your wife it's a job interview and you will be able to hold baby shortly.

Does she want you to advance in your career? It was an interview it's not like you stood there and talked to a friend for 40 minutes and goofing off. You had a legitimate call.

You may be comfortable now but raises are scarce and babies add up FAST. I don't care how tired your wife was- sometimes sacrifices need to be made for the good of the family and not passing up an interview for a better paying position is more important than LESS THAN AN HOUR of holding the baby. She had an emotional response which is understandable, but if she doesn't apologize for the overreaction later she's the AH. Reddit is a cesspool of chronically online people that don't understand how actual human interpersonal relationships work and this was not a good place to ask for an objective opinion", "YTA for agreeing to take the baby and then not communicating to your wife when that plan changed.\n\nThough it really sounds like this is not a one-time issue and you should talk to your wife about why this was a breaking point for her. It could be as simple as having a long day with a fussy baby and not getting the break she needed, or there could be a deeper issue where something you do is letting her down and this was just a straw that broke the camel\u2019s back kind of thing.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve had a newborn AND spent 10 years working in hiring for various levels of jobs, so \u2014 no, most newborns can\u2019t be set down for long (if you think that, you\u2019re probably thinking of babies over 4 months old who are more independent), and most jobs will absolutely reschedule an interview.

Unless you are being specifically head hunted, most interviewers have multiple applicants that are all about the same in terms of viability. They have no need to wait on the convenience of your normal applicant to be available. Taking a phone call from your mum or to a friend is very different to an interview call. Having a baby being distracting or worse, start crying is not going to project \"competent professional\". Some interviewers might be forgiving but a lot are not. The average person has enough competition against them for good, high paying positions without sabotaging their first impression. NTA. It sounds like your wife could use some recharge time though if she is normally a reasonable person. And yes, I was a SAHM for many years. I know exactly how tough it is.

You prioritised something you felt was important but your wife had a different opinion. Hey guess what, this is going to happen A LOT. Her day to day life has massively changed being a SAHM and yours much less so. Your priorities will naturally be different.

You may be planning on using that money for fun, but you know what never hurts when you have children, is a little more money. Cause kids are expensive.

I have two kids that are older and I get not wanting them to cry but sometimes that\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles.\n\nI am going against the grain here and saying NTA, your wife doesn\u2019t have to hold the baby all day. If she wants to have a shower without the baby, roll the bloody bassinet into the bath room and put the kid in there and have a shower, at 7 weeks old she isn\u2019t going anywhere.", "YTA not for not taking the baby right away, it's reasonable for you to answer a call about a job interview. But you're an asshole for saying she's \"being ridiculous\" because it was obviously frustrating for her to not have a break at that moment. \n\nYou prioritized being \"right\" about the phone call over understanding and caring for your wife. An apology for the situation and an acknowledgement of her status of \"can't turn it off\" parent would have gone a long way.", "NTA. In this job market you need to take an interview when offered. Anyone saying that they would have called back isn\u2019t being realists. And your wife should understand that in order for her to have the luxury of being a SAHM you need to have a second job. \nI was a SAHM when we had our twins and our oldest was turning 2 years old. So I had a toddler and newborn twins who were EBF. \nI understand how stressful it is. But if my husband was getting a second job to help support the family, I would not have been so unreasonable with him.", "NAH and people that are saying otherwise probably never had a job. The only thing you could have done different was say \u201cgive me a minute to get to a quiet place\u201d and let your wife know what was happening. She could have done something else for 45 minutes and handed you the baby after. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to pass on an interview. The job market largely stinks right now. You don\u2019t want a baby screaming through it. Taking the call was the best for all of you. And it was 3 pm.

You did what seemed right to you at the time, and your wife understood it as her being ignored. You both are partially wrong. As a former manager in charge of new hires, if you had blown me off I would have continued down my list and not bothered with you. You were right to take the phone call.\n\nHowever, you didn't communicate to your wife the importance of the call. She felt let down and ignored. Use this as a learning opportunity for communication skills.\n\nMy last bit of advice, it's entirely ok to put the baby down and let it cry for a few minutes.

So hold the baby.", "I'm going to go with NTA. You got an important call, one which will directly impact your ability to provide for your family. People here saying that you could have rescheduled have a very optimistic view of the job hiring process. IMO you have to strike while the iron is hot, maybe the next prospect IS available and oh they are a perfect fit, oh and they can start Monday? Bye bye better job. Your wife saying she can take a phone call with the baby is a false equivalency, you needed to give a professional tone and focused attention to this call, which don't include a baby. You offered your wife a break as soon as you were able, and I think that is the most you can be asked for in this situation. When you guys aren't so upset with each though, it may be worth sitting down and figuring out ways to lighten your wife's load, maybe she would like a rule that as soon as you come in you are on baby duty, maybe you need to start cooking dinner, whatever. Good luck.", "NAH. You should have communicated the call was important before walking off, and certainly after you agreed to the interview and knew the call would be a while. \n\nBut having a 7 week old is being in the trenches big time.

You\u2019re going to have squabbles like this, but as long as you communicate and work through stuff you will be fine.", "NTA - I just had my baby and we've had disagreements or miscommunication. I would recommend to apologize and ask what you can do better or differently next time. Explain that a new job is important to you and you did not mean to dismiss her or the baby. \n\nI was on leave watching baby for 6 months and I often would hand baby off as soon as my husband got off work (wfh). I had things I wanted to do too and there were times my husband said he needed time to himself too.

You happ3ned to get the interview call at that moment, then I 100% understand that was more important at that moment. Yes it sucks, so apologize and make it up to the wife.

But, when with a very upset baby, you ha e to put them down sometimes, especially if you are overwhelmed", "NTA, no one is TA here -- your wife is feeling extremely overwhelmed and deserves sympathy and support. I would have asked the recruiter if I could call back in 20 minutes, this always works and you can do this next time. Your focus on your income was NOT wrong, but you can still learn and grow from this experience and realize your wife MUST have that break when you get home. It's vital, especially with the baby being fussy. If your baby can handle walks in carrier or stroller without being fussy I would have tried to make that happen before calling back your recruiter. \n\nYou should also know there is a HUGE double-standard here that you can exploit as a male. \"I'm here with my baby, sorry if she's fussy as she's just had her shots\" is something I could absolutely never say/do in a professional setting because I look like a woman who will split my attention between my family and my work. Men do it all the time at my job though -- I love admiring their babies but mine are only visible when sick or truly melting down.", "NTA, a phone interview to better the lives of your entire family, is definitely #1 priority.

You get a phone call and tell her one second. Upon realizing the call was going to take awhile, you TELL your wife it's an important call for a job interview. Boom.

And then you take the baby from your wife.\n\nInstead, from her perspective: you came home, she asked you to take the baby. you agreed, but told her one second. She's exhausted from caring for baby all. day. long. You then take a phone call about who knows what and disappear for 40 minutes.

My husband stays home with the baby and, despite how exhausted he is, has always been supportive of me taking interviews *because I communicate and I keep his needs in mind when scheduling those calls*. In fact, wherever possible, I took interview calls during my work day specifically so that it wouldn't impact my time at home. \n\nWhat a lot of sole providers don't realize is the time you take the baby is *the only down time the primary parent gets* and is usually used for basic maintenancelike eating, showering,  and sleeping so it's not really down time. And this only gets worse as the kid gets older. I can nearly guarantee you are not working as hard as she is during the day. I certainly don't work as hard as my husband does. Babies are fucking exhausting, especially at this early stage when she's either not on a schedule yet or the schedule changes as soon as it's been established. \n\nYour wife likely feels under appreciated, unseen, and under cared for while being expected to take on this new challenge of parenting, mostly on her own. I would encourage you to take a few days to do her job,  the way she does it, without her there to help or guide you so you can fully understand and appreciate what she's going through because a few hours in the evening and on weekends does not at all compare to the work she's putting in during the days.", "ESH.

There's obviously going to be stress, exhaustion and some hiccups along the way, it's inevitable. \n\nHowever, I feel like your communication could use a scootch of improvement OP. You told your wife \"one moment\" but then didn't clarify that it would be longer after finding out it was an interview (a task that usually takes a longer time to complete). While there's absolutely nothing wrong with taking the interview in the moment, and I'm sure your wife would understand, I feel like you owed her an explanation beyond \"I had to take a call\". This makes it sound a bit like your priorities come first regardless of her needs and like you don't feel that you need to explain yourself to her. \n\nIf something like this comes up again, I would recommend saying \"one moment\" while you answer the phone, but then asking the interviewer/other party to give you a moment so that you can let your wife know. You can word it to the interviewer that you want to make sure you aren't interrupted if you're worried about professionalism. This helps to clarify needs on both sides and also helps to establish a possible timeline for when those needs will be met (most adults are familiar with an interview process so you being 40 minutes wouldn't be unexpected).\n\nJust remember to work with your wife and that a little communication goes a long way!\n\nETA: Your wife isn't in the wrong here either for being angry and lashing out against you. Also, telling her she's being ridiculous is *not* going to help. You're understandably upset at her reaction, but this goes back to the communication piece. Talk to each other, figure out each other's needs and work out a routine that works for you. She's probably burnt out/touched out as heck right now. Try helping her with baby-free time, ask if there's anything she would like you to do to take a couple things off of her plate, or just jump in to lighten her load and give her a break wherever you can.

You don't take that call I'm calling the next person on my list, because the only reason why you got a call, and they didn't is because they made a typo but it's not going to affect the job and I can schedule the interviews and go home without having to make follow up calls the next day.", "No, handling the baby who is already fussy during an interview is not right.

They might have been, but how do you know that? If it's a good opportunity my family needed, nothing short of someone dying would have stopped me from taking that call. \"If they're that brutal you'd be better off without that company!\" is an unrealistic perspective to have. \n\n\nOn the flip side OPs partner is completely valid in being stressed and upset that he took a 40 minute phone call as soon as he got home.

OP\u2019s wife certainly deserves a break the second he gets home, and I\u2019m sure she was looking forward to being able to hand off the baby after a long and hard day. She was reacting to not having enough information about why he was taking that phone call. They are new parents who are still trying to figure out life with a baby and how to do it together. They both are probably really tired and sleep deprived. OP\u2019s wife is more so because she is doing something new to her versus her husband just going about his normal day and continuing his work he is already familiar with. So I think with grace from both of them for each other, the situation would have been easier to navigate. It does not feel to me that either one of them was being willfully, uncooperative or mean.

Obviously the timing sucked and is out of his control but it's also pretty obvious that's not why she's upset. It just happened to be the phone call that was the catalyst. She's 7 weeks pp with her first kid and is probably overwhelmed as fuck", "Depending on the baby, I am sure a screaming baby in the background would have made that interview go really smoothly.", "I am upvoting you because people really need to start understanding that babies - even newborns - CAN be put down.

Sorry I can't help until we are done\" and then continue the call. This is NOT a difficult situation to manage. Also, employers calling for interviews around dinner time know it is a bad time. They are either testing to see if you will work in the evening, or they should understand if it is a bad time...

Not all men fall into the same stereotypes you seem to be holding in your head.\n\nAnd for what it is worth, while family IS important, prioritizing a phone call from a recruiter or potential interviewer IS also incredibly important and it is justified to prioritize that. Family stuff happens every single day but interviews and first impressions with interviewers only happens a handful of times in your life. And if that leads to a significantly better job with much better pay, that IS for the family.\n\nIn short, by taking the phone call, OP WAS prioritizing their family.\n\nEdit: Please also see the replies later in this thread.

They don't need to care about typos here. This isn't their job. But having a typo in your resume means that you may not have the attention to detail that a job calls for. It's ridiculous to ask how a typo can affect job applications. Come on, don't be naive", ">Why are you discounting people for criteria you can't even hold up to yourself?\n\nMost people in general hold themselves to different standards depending on context. Applying and/or interviewing for a job? You're going to put a lot of effort in. Posting in anonymous reddit threads? Who are you impressing?", "Yeah, this commenter is ridiculous. You don't get to look down your nose and shit on others when you can't even manage a basic, coherent sentence. Holy run-ons, Batman!", "OP said it's what they both want. So yeah, she \"gets to\" stay home.", "Agree as well, he should have said 'Oh, this is probably that job I applied for' when the phone was still ringing.  Also, she could have walked over to him any time during the phone call and heard a job interview happening.\n\nNAH, they're both new parents and have frazzled brains.", "Yep, most definitely!", "\u201cFun money.\u201d It\u2019s literally in his post. Everyone is projecting their own money worries on OP so hard.", "Exactly. His poor wife *asked him for help with their child* and he left her hanging without so much as a word and ran off for 40 min to talk on the phone which is so fucked. Like she said she literally does *everything* with their baby attached to her all day every day, but he acted like it was impossible to put them on mute for a second, get the baby settled in his arms, then take the call, like infants emit cell phone jamming radio frequencies or something \ud83d\ude44", "My dissertation topic was on work/life balance, stress, and financial well- being on life satisfaction. The modern concept of work/ life balance has been researched for well over 100 years. But, the concept of working to live and enjoying life has been in discussions for thousands of years.", "Sucks? Yes. Surprising? No. \nIf OP is in the US, getting a new *higher* paying job isn\u2019t easy right now. Job hunting right now is awful.", "Don't take this as me arguing, but did this hold true when your oldest was freshly vaxxed? OP says shes extra fussy due to that so I'm just curious", "He should've told his wife what was going on then instead of telling her \"just a sec\" and then disappearinh for 40 minutes", "For sure. They know you can\u2019t even give them your full attention during an interview they 100% won\u2019t hire you unless you have some crazy unicorn criteria they can\u2019t find anywhere else but likely this guy does not.", "That\u2019s not at all the question at hand though. People are upset about the company calling in the \u201clead up to dinner.\u201d 3:00PM is NOT within an hour of MOST people\u2019s dinner time.", "Ridiculous!! As a normal job interviewer should know and work around this. So what's the magic time frame?  Cooking with an infant is doable, women have done this for millenia!! And absolutely no, not acceptable, logical or professional for a job interview. He should have communicated but 3pm is ridiculously early, even with a newborn. She sounds burned out but also very well could and should have just postponed. I mean it takes also 5 secs to eavesdrop and realize it's an important call and just pivot.", "He really had no idea if it was or wasn\u2019t an emergency, though, because he brushed her off and went in the other room. He had no idea *why* she wanted him to take the baby.", "It was his choice not to explain to his wife why he had to take this particular call.  He just doesn't consider her important enough to make the tiny little bit of effort that would take.", "Do people not really understand that when an interviewer calls for an interview, you generally should do the interview then?", "They never said they look down their nose and shit on those people. Part of their job is to pare down the list to a manageable number of applicants to call within a given time frame, and then place who's left into an order to be called in. If more applicants are of acceptable quality on paper than the number to be pared down to, some sort of criteria has to be applied to whittle it down further. With so little info to go on, things like spelling/grammar mistakes on a resume (a document they've ostensibly combed over to ensure accuracy and whatnot) becomes fair game. What would you prefer be the criteria used in that situation?\n\nThey aren't saying this is a good or fair system, they're just relaying the reality of the situation and how people in those roles are often taught to go about it.", "Person responsible for any hiring decision it's usually a quite busy person,who has no time to look at many candidates and wants to fill the role as soon as possible, but also wants to see many candidates in the shortest possible time. It means that a recruiter is supposed to get a number of interviews in a row,and get expected number of qualified candidates to choose from. That's why waiting, talking later and other options might be not available.", "So what if it is? She'll benefit too.", "In my case, yes...as long as he was being held he was super chill. \n\nBut the point that I poorly made is that every baby/parent relationship is different. My youngest was....less chill. \ud83d\ude02"]}
