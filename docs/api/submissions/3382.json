People want quality tattoos and it\u2019s not uncommon to share good or bad experiences with others looking to use an artist. How you treat people can also come back to hurt your business as this artist is finding out.", "Definitely NTA.  You gave the tat artist a lovely evening out.  They never should have offered to do the tat for free unless they planned on following through on their commitment to you.  He/she didn't stand by their word, talked you into agreeing to do the tat in a different color than you wanted it to be, and it faded almost immediately!  Then, they didn't back up their word about fixing it.  The tattoo artist is TA, not you.  Big time AH IMO. Very unethical. That is not how a responsible person does business.  You have every right to warn people who reach out to you about your experience with this person.   I'd send a message back through the person who reported what the tattoo artist said about you, that you're \"only speaking the truth when asked for a recommendation.  If they would prefer that you recommend them and not tell people what occurred, then they should have honored their commitments.\"", "NTA.\n\nTattoo artist here sounds like a real dipshit. \n\nThe way I see it, you're not going around slandering this dude. People talk to you about stick & poke, mention this artist specifically, and then you just tell them about your personal experience as it factually occurred. That's not badmouthing them, that's giving someone an honest answer based on facts when asked. \n\nAdditionally, he fucked you over twice (the way I see it) and deserves to be publicly shamed anyway. Depending on where you live, you may be entitled to legal damages (speak to a lawyer if you'd like) for breach of contract (verbal agreements could be binding where you live).", "If they had said \"I won't charge for my work,  but the facility wants $75\" before, they'd have a leg to stand on. Then, they went & did a tattoo that wasn't the way you wanted it & didn't meet your expectations. That's unprofessional & you're NTA for giving an honest opinion.", "NTA. Tattoo artist did not keep his part of the bargain - given, that you've got it as a bargain / trade thing. Also, ignoring your customers and postponing things you should've fixed? yeah NTA. I wouldn't tell anyone not to go there, but I'd tell them the story.

Even worse, they didn\u2019t even do a good job and your tattoo is already fading.

You are not openly trying to hurt their business. Only when someone brings them up do you share your experience. This is completely fair.", "NTA - it\u2019s your god damn right to review a person\u2019s service", "NTA - sounds like you got the bait and switch and he\u2019s a bit of a scammer. If he did offer to tattoo you for free then charged you after the fact with a list of excuses, he breached your verbal contract. His own bad business practices led him here. If he hadn\u2019t reneged on his end of the bargain, and he did a good job, he might have gained more business from you singing his praises rather than losing business.", "NTA. Telling the truth isn't badmouthing.", "Technically you\u2019re just leaving verbal reviews around town. You could do way worse with a nasty 1 star review on Yelp or something. I think you\u2019re being classy just sharing your honest feedback with those who ask.\n\nNTA", "Nta. They run a bad business", "NTA you owe him nothing", "NTA. Sounds unprofessional. My tattoo artist is my friend but he runs his own business so even knowing each other for years we always settle price estimates first because it's a business transaction. There has been maybe one time where the piece took longer or was more detailed than we previously planned and I have had no issue paying a few bucks extra, even though he would allow me just to pay the initial estimate but I'm not going to stiff my buddy for going the extra mile for the piece. \n\nFor this person to do the work and then tell you to pay up 75 bucks when they never implied there was a change to the verbal contract is just AH behaviour and definitely worth mentioning to any future customers.", "NTA your not badmouthing them your sharing the experience that you had with them.

He sounds like a mess. But in the future... Walk out if an artist isn't going to 100% tattoo you as *you* requested.
