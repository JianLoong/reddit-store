But I do so tire of people\u2019s entitlement to things they want or property they want to trespass. Seems there is no end. And as much I genuinely, truly despise Draconic states, like my own\u2019s ability to rob freedoms from people they deem less than, I do believe in the stand your ground trespassing law and how they would have a hard time finding a thief, the victim. In just about any circumstance. \nI truly appreciate the discourse. I learned some things. Generalizing is *bad. M\u2019kay*"]}
