The waiter asked me which level of spice I preferred and I said \u201cas little as possible\u201d. The flavors were good, but the dish ended up being too spicy for me to really enjoy and when he asked how I liked my dish, I said just that.  He kindly brought some yogurt, and I didn\u2019t complain about it or ask the waiter to make a new dish-I know Indian food can be quite spicy.  The yogurt helped, but I still couldn\u2019t eat it. On the way home in the car he was still commenting \u201coh, come on, it\u2019s wasn\u2019t that spicy\u201d. And. \u201cBut spicy IS the flavor\u201d. I\u2019d had enough and said \u201cI wish you would stop acting superior because you can tolerate spicy food. I cannot.\u201d Of course he argued, and the subject was eventually dropped.   \n\nHere\u2019s my issue. He LOVES everything spicy. I had to have 6 Gaviscon just to get to sleep and I only ate about 10 bites. I just couldn\u2019t eat it.  He thinks it\u2019s funny that I\u2019m sensitive to spicy food He makes snarky comments about \u201cAmerican food\u201d all the time. That it\u2019s bland and unhealthy. I love Mexican food, and I avoid dishes I know to be spicy food. Kind of like how other people can\u2019t tolerate gluten or lactose.  I\u2019m just fed up with his superiority complex and how he criticizes our \u201cAmerican\u201dfood.  \n\nMy daughter is completely in love with him and has branched out and is learning to enjoy a lot of Asian cuisine and has started to love  spicy food now, which is fine. I\u2019m just tired of him making snarky comments about our \u201cAmerican\u201d food and my inability to tolerate spicy food.  It\u2019s boring and we\u2019ve already established it.

Personally. I love chilli heat, but that's not a moral virtue. I've learnt to cook dishes with paprika instead of chilli powder, for the same flavour profile, and to replace fresh chillis with bell peppers likewise. And many very trad Indian dishes I make don't even use chilli. He's just a young dude swinging his dick to feel special. He probably can't even list actual spices that go into Indian cooking.

I'm deathly allergic to all types of chillies and I can't eat anything spicy as a result. If you're going out to eat Indian food, check that the place is run by Bangladeshis as Indian and Pakistani restaurants have spice in EVERYTHING.

Like, she even thinks Old Bay is way too hot.\n\nWho cares? When she visits, I make food super basic and I put seasonings out so people can do up their own plates.", "Not at all! You seem lovely, actually.", "Gotcha thanks for the info", "The waiter asked me how spicy I wanted it. I cannot eat anything spicy. I didn\u2019t complain.  But when he asked on the way home what I thought I told him. I don\u2019t think you read my post.", "And yes. I\u2019m a white lady. But my intolerance to spicy food has nothing to do with me being a white lady.", "Wow.", "I mean korma probably has less spice lol", "I also say NTA, but I'm wondering what's up with your daughter. \n\nI hope she realizes she should have been taking up for her mom here, and that her boyfriend is an oaf.", "NTA liking spicy food should not make up one's entire personality. He sounds insufferable. \n\nI love spicy food, btw. But not everyone does, and that's ok. People ask me if something is spicy and I make a pained face and tell them I'm not the best person to ask, but I don't think so?", "NTA. My stomach can't handle spicy either. It's not a joking matter. Im so sorry he acted that way. Not everyone is going to handle spice as well as others", "Nta being able to handle spicy food doesn't make some better or worse than anyone else.\n\nIf you go to Indian again, I recommend butter chicken if it's on the menu. Not spicy AT ALL.", "NTA. I love spicy food, my mother does not and it upsets het stomach. We jokingly call her spice intolerant. I'm lactose intolerant and now have to avoid gluten. I hate mushrooms, she loves them. I love honeydew, she hates it. People's taste buds and digestive systems are different. We both hate cilantro lol.\n\nNeither of us is right or wrong.\n(Btw, my brother and my mom love this brand called Fody which is like free from all spices/low fodmap)\n\nGive some arsenic to your daughter's boyfriend, that'll spice things up.", "As someone who loves spicy food, to quote a meme, \"you're weak, your bloodline is weak, and you won't survive the winter\". But no you're NTA here and he needs to back all the fuck off.", "He\u2019s young\u2026 he\u2019s not an Asshole regardless of this subs title.

It\u2019s annoying and vey boring.", "No worries as long as you stay home \ud83e\udd23", "I thought we were talking about early teens....mid twenties? Jesus, I feel sorry for you. Hope your daughter moves on sooner than later.", "NTA OP, and more likely than not, YOU have the superior sense of taste and he has a worse sense of taste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've generally found that the people who like really, really spicy and/or hot (hot and spicy are different things) food tend to have a poor sense of taste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be clear, I am not saying the food they like is bad, I am saying that their sense of taste cannot detect subtle flavors, which is why they almost universally consider anything not intensely spicy bland.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's like the taste equivalent of needing a hearing aid or glasses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Before anyone says it, I'm well aware that spicy food does not kill your taste buds. It just causes your mouth to go a bit numb. [I'm referring to the fact that not everyone has the same strength of taste](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2016/05/31/super-tasters-non-tasters-is-it-better-to-be-average/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt depends on the quantity of taste buds you have. More taste buds = \"supertasters\" who have a stronger sense of taste, about 25% of the population. Less taste buds \"non-tasters\" who have a weaker sense of taste, also about 25% of the population. And the remaining 50% are in the middle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom the link:\n\n>\\[Supertasters\\] They do not like hot, spicy foods because the receptors for pain surround the taste cells, so they also have more pain receptors.  \n>  \n>Non-tasters like hot spicy foods, and usually require more seasoning to make it taste good. This is true except for salt. Because salt masks bitterness, super-tasters tend to consume more sodium than non-tasters.", "NTA - next time try chicken korma.       \nIt\u2019s one of the least spicy.       \nNo heat        \nThat\u2019s of course only if you want to try it again.       \nTotally up to you, not everyone likes it \nAlso drink milk not water it gets rid of the heat better.        \nI worked in an Indian restaurant", "I think not being able to eat spicy food is childish \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Nta\n\nBiryani contains a lotta spices and u rlly cant extract/exclude them even if u ask \"as little as possible\".

PEPPER is too spicy for me, and my friends love poking fun at me for it, but it's all in good fun and they don't mean anything by it. They sure don't act like they're better than I am or constantly telling me that food \"isn't that spicy\" they know if something is even a little spicy I can't eat it and they respect it. Sorry your daughter is dating an ass, hopefully she'll see him for the ass he is.", "NTA I really like spicy food, but I would never berate someone for not sharing my fondness for hot/spicy food.

I painfully learned my bum can taste spicy food better than the other end.", "So much this. I don\u2019t mind a bit of spicy food, but it\u2019s absolutely not great for my acid reflux so I rarely eat it anymore and only in small amounts. The same goes for very acidic foods. My stomach doesn\u2019t give a crap how spicy someone else thinks something is or how much food they think I should be eating, and since they won\u2019t be the ones regurgitating everything they ingest (including water) and acid for days and unable to sleep, I don\u2019t give a crap about what they think either.", "No it just means you are going to get a lot more peoples opinions. By the way NTA hopefully your daughter drops his ass soon.", "Here to tell you that you made me laugh like a donkey and I startled my sleeping cats. So worth it. I keep picturing a bum hole as a mouth with a lot to say.", "If you give Indian food another try, butter chicken is *usually* once of the least spicy dishes on the menu. I have a very low spice tolerance and I've never had a problem asking for mild butter chicken, aside from the times the server has looked at me like I'm an idiot and told me that butter chicken *is* mild. \n\nI don't know your ethnicity, but if you aren't white, saying \"white person mild\" may also help. I made the mistake once of letting my Indian friend order for me and the \"mild\" they brought out for him was so spicy that the poor server thought I was about to have a medical emergency in his restaurant."]}
