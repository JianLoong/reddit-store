She wanted Indian food.  I\u2019ve never had it-I enjoy roti and Naan bread, but I\u2019ve never had a meal. I ordered chicken Biranyi. The waiter asked me which level of spice I preferred and I said \u201cas little as possible\u201d. The flavors were good, but the dish ended up being too spicy for me to really enjoy and when he asked how I liked my dish, I said just that.  He kindly brought some yogurt, and I didn\u2019t complain about it or ask the waiter to make a new dish-I know Indian food can be quite spicy.  The yogurt helped, but I still couldn\u2019t eat it. On the way home in the car he was still commenting \u201coh, come on, it\u2019s wasn\u2019t that spicy\u201d. And. \u201cBut spicy IS the flavor\u201d. I\u2019d had enough and said \u201cI wish you would stop acting superior because you can tolerate spicy food. I cannot.\u201d Of course he argued, and the subject was eventually dropped.   \n\nHere\u2019s my issue. He LOVES everything spicy. I had to have 6 Gaviscon just to get to sleep and I only ate about 10 bites. I just couldn\u2019t eat it.  He thinks it\u2019s funny that I\u2019m sensitive to spicy food He makes snarky comments about \u201cAmerican food\u201d all the time. That it\u2019s bland and unhealthy. I love Mexican food, and I avoid dishes I know to be spicy food. Kind of like how other people can\u2019t tolerate gluten or lactose.  I\u2019m just fed up with his superiority complex and how he criticizes our \u201cAmerican\u201dfood.  \n\nMy daughter is completely in love with him and has branched out and is learning to enjoy a lot of Asian cuisine and has started to love  spicy food now, which is fine. I\u2019m just tired of him making snarky comments about our \u201cAmerican\u201d food and my inability to tolerate spicy food.  It\u2019s boring and we\u2019ve already established it.  Just let it go, Also, he\u2019s kind of a \u201cChad\u201d.

You don\u2019t like it or can\u2019t tolerate it, that\u2019s fair enough. \n\nIf I\u2019m being honest, dude, I\u2019d just tell him to STFU because he\u2019s irritating as hell.

As I\u2019ve gotten older, I also can\u2019t tolerate it as much. \n\nAlso, spicy is NOT the flavor.

He needs to shut up and you should tell him you are not interested in his opinion", "NTA. I LOVE spicy food but I pay for it later with heartburn. You tried food, it didn't agree with you and there's nothing wrong with that. There's tons of flavorful food to be had that doesn't encompass spicy. The fact you're open to trying new food possibilities is all that can be asked for. No idea of the ages as none listed but I really hope he's in his mid to late teens. Most kids those age think they're everything and it's a bit more expected. If he's older, he's even more the ahole. No need to make fun of a person who just tried something and can't eat it.", "Nta.  The only thing I think you could have done differently is research the food more in advance.   There are different dishes that are tend to be less spicy than others.  But then different restaurants can have different spice levels too. \nAs far as the boyfriend goes, he's the ta for sure.  Food can be interesting without being spicy.   It can be herbs instead.

Telling your daughter's boyfriend to stop acting superior because he can tolerate spicy food was the right thing to do. Your preference for milder food is just like other people's food intolerances. It's not a superiority issue. It's important to respect each other's preferences and not belittle them. As the saying goes, \"Different strokes for different folks.\" \n\nIt's great that your daughter is exploring new cuisines, but it's not okay for her boyfriend to make snarky comments about American food or criticize your preferences. It's like saying someone's music taste is superior because they like classical music and the other person likes pop. Everyone should just enjoy what they like and respect each other's choices.", "What a strange thing to be proud of.   \n\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s exactly what I would say.", "NTA: You mention his age in the comments.

You were happy to try a new type of food, and didn't make a fuss. The boyfriend is rude, and he's also wrong - spice alone isn't the flavour - some of my favourite chilli's are ones that aren't as hot but have really interesting flavours behind the spice levels.", "UGH I'm so sorry and you're very much NTA. What your daughter's Chad doesn't realise is that not all Indian food is 'spicy\" and that \"spice\" doesn't mean chilli heat. He reminds me of the UK dudes who will only ever order vindaloo. Personally. I love chilli heat, but that's not a moral virtue. I've learnt to cook dishes with paprika instead of chilli powder, for the same flavour profile, and to replace fresh chillis with bell peppers likewise. And many very trad Indian dishes I make don't even use chilli. He's just a young dude swinging his dick to feel special. He probably can't even list actual spices that go into Indian cooking. Put it in the eyeroll-oh-the-glory/silliness-of-youth pile.", "NTA. How old is he? This sounds like some 16-20 year old dude behavior. They typically outgrew it, or joined the army in my experience.", "Nta but thats not what a \"chad\" is.", "NTA\n\nDifferent people can tolerate different levels of spice. It does not make you better to be able to eat spicier things.\n\nI ate spicier food in my 20's. In my 40's my body does not react so well to that level of spiciness. I'd rather enjoy my food than feel miserable because of eating it. \n\nMaybe you don't need to eat with your daughter's boyfriend if he can't handle someone else having different requirements or preferences than him.", "I love spicy food but no one realizes until I order/eat it because bragging about that is stupid and pointless. Sure, I can tolerate spice, but weird textures? Brrr. I'm sure Mr Amazing BF has a weak, soft underbelly he's protecting with all of that bravado. NTA", "NTA. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents both have pretty low spice tolerance. Making fun of them for it would be absurd.", "NTA. He's being a food fascist.\n\nI love spicy food; my husband does not. We do not bully each other over our respective preferences because we are adults. You tried the food; you didn't like it.\n\nedited a typo", "NTA and your daughter's boyfriend needs to grow up. I mean, it's such a basic thing, what sort of emotionally developed person gets judgmental over how much spice someone can eat. Also, I don't know what's up with the restaurant you went to. I eat quite a lot of Indian food, and I personally really enjoy spice, but my wife doesn't, and when we order something to share, we always buy a non-spicy option... and there's always exactly zero spicy anything in it. So I don't understand why a dish with \"as little spice as possible\" would cause such issues?", "NTA", "NTA, he sounds insufferable.
