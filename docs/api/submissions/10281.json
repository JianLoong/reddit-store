Sure they peer pressured a bit but it doesn\u2019t seem like it was with malintent.", "you have to edit out the old judgment too for it to count XD", "They literally started taking ops jacket off so that she could try on the other jacket. It doesn\u2019t matter if they meant to be assholes, they were ignoring her wishes and asking her repeatedly to do something she said she didn\u2019t want to do.", "Ever hear the phrase \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\"?\n\nImpact is always more important than intent.", "OP literally asked about their intent in her last sentence.", "They stepped over the line. Completely, and it feels like they did it to be cruel to you. NTA", "NAH.\n\nThey were probably just surprised at your reaction, but you definitely did nothing wrong. I personally hate it when people crowd me at my desk, particularly if it's two or more people standing directly behind me to the point where I can't move my chair at all. I'll just straight up stop working and let them know they need to take at minimum 5 steps backwards.", "Intent is not fucking magic.\n\nImagine this scenario: Someone steps on OP's toes, and they say \"Hey, I don't like people stepping on my toes.\" But then the other person tells OP they think stepping on toes is good for their feet and then *deliberately steps on OP's toes again*. At that point OP (rightfully) gets upset and tells them they don't want their toes stepped on, but then the toe-steppers somehow get mad at OP for not wanting their toes stepped on. \n\nHow are there no bad intentions at that point?", "NTA and sorry but wth are these people doing working in a doctors office when they can\u2019t read the room and the emotional state of a coworker that they Should know a baseline for?!", "NTA but YTA but to yourself. People here keep talking about boundaries, but they don't seem to understand the point of boundaries. A boundary drawn is you not allowing them to cross it. \n\nThey were overbearing and crossed lines, but you can't control that. Your boundary needed to be at trying on the jacket. End the discussion or walk away then.\n\nYou allowed them to push you past that, got flustered and made things worse. Should they have pushed? Of course not. They were definitely AHs. But at work you need to draw a firm box.\n\nIt sucks that your colleagues were rude and boxed you into a corner.", "NTA.   Learn how to do this now - it will serve you well over time.  If you have decided that \"no\" is your answer, learn how to say it  - or a very polite 'no thank you' - without explanation, without apology, and ***without giving a reason***.  \n\nThere's a scene in Goodfellas where Ray Liotta is offering something to DeNiro.  DeNiro just keeps repeating \"No, I can't have it.  I can't have it.\"   No reason, no apology.   Just No.\n\nFor many people, reasons sound like the beginning of negotiations.  You have a reason, they'll have a counter for it.   Another reason - another counter.   Don't let yourself get dragged into some drawn-out debate about it, and don't let yourself get guilted or bullied.  The way to do this is the simple, lone, and very polite \"no thank you\".    Give. No. Reasons.    Refuse to negotiate.\n\nIn general terms - for this situation and for many others - if a person is genuinely ***asking*** you for something, they will understand that one possible answer is \"no\".   If they were never really asking - if they're making demands disguised as a request -  they'll be ***insulted*** by the answer no.   They'll be ***livid*** that you're not going to give them what they want.   That anger - that'll tell you who isn't your friend.   That's when you'll know they don't give a shit about you, your preferences, your feelings, the hardship they may be putting on you - they just want you to give them what they want already and shut up about it.", "NTA. Your reaction was fine. You clearly communicated what you needed and it seems to have effectively got them to back off. Hopefully your coworkers are reasonable people and are just surprised and maybe you could apologize for snapping to maintain good relationships but you were not overreacting.", "NTA you said no multiple times and you were still pretty polite. They massively overstepped", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. I hate the pack mentality of this whole story. So what if they had \u201cgood intentions\u201d. Good intentions stop being good intentions if the other refuses to listen to the word NO. You said no many times, and they proceeded to  physically touched you to PULL OFF YOUR JACKET! I\u2019m shocked not one of them thought how they were behaving was unkind or pushy.", "NTA - they shouldn't have pushed the issue. I know that for me personally, just reading this story triggered my own anxiety about not only trying on something that doesn't fit and risk either ripping it or getting stuck, but also being surrounded by people who aren't listening to me. I would've done the same thing, if not even worse.", "> They kept pushing and pushing and my coworker even started pulling my jacket off!!\n\nAt the point where you have to tell coworkers \"stop taking my clothes off\" and they aren't listening, it's basically impossible for you to be the asshole.", "NAH.\n\nI believe they were trying to be helpful. You set your boundaries. \n\nEveryone can shake it off and move on.", "And also, \"just trying to help\" often means \"just want to feel helpful\".\n\nOP is NTA.", "You told them no multiple times and they pushed you anyway. NTA", "NTA, Who the heck tries to pour a doctors coat off?", "I\u2019ve had this happen as well when I was younger, where skinnier friends would insist I try on something which obviously wasn\u2019t going to fit me. I don\u2019t understand it.", "What?? I agree with nta but this doesn\u2019t really have much to do with work/life balance. They were just giving her clothes to try on in the new weather. Sounded like fun before they pushed it too far", "Big NTA. I got anxiety just reading this!!!", "NTA. You handled that waaay better than I would have. My response might have been more like \"Stop f@#&ING touching me!\".", "Why are you upset? They invaded your personal space & you felt closed in when they were around you! They owe you the apology! It was really insensitive & flat out rude!", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nI'd note, too, that a coat that's too tight over short-sleeves-weather clothing is going to be that much more too tight over cold-weather clothing/layers.", "Wow, you very neatly explained something that took me years to grasp. Wonderful, thank you."]}
