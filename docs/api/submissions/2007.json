No one should be bringing in someone who has hurt their partner into their shared home. No one should have their safe place violated by person who is toxic to them. \n\nThis is his home he\u2019s created with or with out you. It\u2019s where him comes to relax, to feel safe. Homes are not just shelter they often act like a massive safety blanket to those who live there. It is no longer his safety blanket. It\u2019s no longer a place he feels he can relax because the one person who attacked him and never apologised has invaded his space with his fianc\u00e9s permission. Someone he should be able to trust. \nSounds like this friend wants to leave her toxic husband and you have never called out or defended your partner against the actions that hurt him. She called him a shitty person in public. She doesn\u2019t get to live in his house with out his permission.\n\nThere is plenty of ways you could have assisted her during this time that didn\u2019t involve lying to your partner, breaking a firm boundary and making him financially responsible for another person. Those actions have made you the toxic person to him. You\u2019ve violated his trust, his money, his home, his emotional well-being and his boundaries. \n\nYou friend sounds shitty too. She never apologised. Moved in with you knowing how they both feel about each other and didn\u2019t even reach out to apologise and thank him for the roof over her head? \n\nCongratulations instead of offering to help pay for some of her rent elsewhere, taking her to a shelter or helping her secure a place and job away from her ex you both bit the hand that feeds you. \n\nAlso did it ever occur to you that fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t want you alone in a house with a woman fleeing DV?

You went behind your fiance's back to give your friend a place to stay, that is wrong.

I've been that woman, trying to escape a horrible and abusive marriage, and if a friend of mine wouldn't let me stay based  soley on their SO's dislike of me...that person would no longer be my friend.", "YTA. Having anyone else living in your home even for a few days requires discussion and agreement between all parties, especially when the guest will be there \"for a few months\".  You have likely lost your fiance's trust.  And im sure you would not like it if your fiance had a friend you didnt like or want in your home, and he disregarded your feelings and allowed his friend to move in for months.  A person's home is their sanctuary and if your fiance doesn't like  your friend, he will be uncomfortable in his own home and that isnt right.   I know you had good intentions to help your friend, but if her husband is truly abusive, you are placing yourself and your fiance in danger by allowing her to stay in your home.

I\u2019m glad she realized that. But the man you plan on marrying said no. This is an all or nothing situation. He is paying the bills. He decides who lives there jointly with you. How about he moves in a friend who needed help? I mean he doesn\u2019t even need to ask bc it doesn\u2019t matter what you say. You made a promise you couldn\u2019t keep. You were wrong. I would start looking at options. If she has a job she needs to find a place to stay and quickly. Maybe you should pay for her first month\u2019s rent since you assured her you would make sure she has a place to live. I was going to say not the a thinking a week or two but you promised her almost half a YEAR!!!", "YTA, and to be honest I'm surprised he isn't telling you to leave with her.

You have no respect for him, or his boundaries. You need to help her find a room to rent somewhere, or she can go to a shelter for abused women. You created this mess with your lies. I hope your fiance dumps you and finds a more honest partner who shows him some respect. I hope your tears and manipulative tactics don't work on him.", "YTA.  Your fiance said know. He owns the house.  Good luck finding a new place to live if you don't tell your friend to leave, as you will find yourself homeless and single too.  You've shown your fiance you don't respect him, so he will be rethinking your relationship at this point.", "Yta not only you let her stay after he told you not to. You also manipulation your finance to get you way by crying. Maybe when your single you and best friend can get your own place together.

It's actually his home he didn't want her in I would kick you both out your a bad fianc\u00e9.", "YTA so badly.... just think maybe in a few months you and your friend can be roomies somewhere together when you both get booted out.

Such women seem to make sport of degrading the husband and trying to convince the wife she would be improving her life by looking outside the marriage.\n\nIf it was just because I plain didn't like her personality, I would agree under the condition that I show her respect in my house and she shows me the same.  My wife and I actually rescued a woman in a similar situation, my wife ended up putting her out because she treated me like absolute garbage with the assumption that she is my wife's friend and there is nothing we would do about it.

Most ppl would throw you both out", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say NTA. If the friend really is being abused and OPs husband isn\u2019t even around for 5 months he should have said ok. Fair enough if he was at home too but to turn away OPs friend from an abusive situation when he\u2019s not even around just seems too far. What does it matter to him if she\u2019s there while he\u2019s gone? As long as she moves out before he comes home I don\u2019t see why he\u2019s being so harsh about it. \n\nI wonder if the friend had posted on Reddit describing how she\u2019s being abused and how her friends husband is away for 5 months but won\u2019t let her stay there and she has no where else to go - how many redditors would be calling him the asshole then \ud83d\ude43", "YTA", "YTA-What is WRONG with you? Why couldn't you respect your husband wishes? Why couldn't you respect your shared HOME? Your friend doesn't have any other family/friends? Give her money to stay somewhere else, or support her in other ways. Help her get her help/resources. If I were your husband I wouldn't trust you. Your also a manipulation the situation by crying when you knew you were wrong. Keep pushing your husband like that and eventually your friend will be helping you through your own divorce IF you get married.  And who cares what she thinks about him when you were in college? People can't change?", "NTA. Going against the grain here, but my bestie had to leave an abusive marriage and I was happy to be able to help by giving her a place to stay. It's not like you're inviting her in for a fun vacation - you're stepping up in a crisis. You know how fucking dangerous it is to leave an abuser? I do! She does! You do! Why doesn't your man?\n\nI think it's pretty fucked that your boyfriend is holding a grudge from years ago about her calling him out for treating you badly. Was he? And if he wasn't, has he really not been able to dig deep and consider that however ill-advised her behavior was, it was in defense of you because she loves you? And he still can't get over it in a situation like: she needs a safe place to live so she can leave an abuser? He's not even in the house for pete's sake. That's a lack of empathy that is a flag to me.\n\nFrankly I'd move out and throw in with your friend to rent a place together. You can decide whether or not you want to stay with him without worrying about getting kicked out, you can protect your friend, and maybe you can get a little space from a guy who has the empathy of a coke bottle.", "YTA.

Whatever fallout happens remember it's your fault for violating his trust.", "Glhf your life is gg straight downhill after this", "INFO did your fiance give any \\*reason\\* he didn't want her to stay? That seems very callous and uncaring of him to not want to help. I disagree with all the Y T A votes. It really depends if he offered any valid reasons. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis may be an ESH situation - he should never have been so opposed to at least potentially helping a women in what sounds like it may have been an abusive situation, but you should never have given an open invitation for her to stay while she deals with the divorce (sometimes that takes a year or more!!) instead of coming up with other solutions.", "YTA, he will end up telling you both to leave", "YTA. Taking away his comfort in his own home is one of the worst things you could have done to him. You're a terrible girlfriend.", "YTA. A major AH", "YTA why would you think it's okay to disrespect your partner?", "YTA. You have no respect for your fiance. I don't see how your relationship can last when you care so little about him and are content to lie (yes hiding that you have a temporary roommate in both of your home is lying) to get your way.", "YTA 100%. Have you and your friend started house hunting together yet?", "Yta!", "YTA. You asked. He answered. You ignored him, lied to him, then manipulated him. Why ask if you didn't care about his answer?", "YTA.  You asked, he said no, you disregarded his answer and you got caught.  He is within his rights to be pissed off at you.  And he is completely within his rights to demand that your friend leave within a week. \n\nAnd unfortunately (for you) at this point you will now have to tell your friend that she has one week to leave.  Of course, you could decide not to do so, but taking that route could very well lead to your fianc\u00e9 taking more drastic measures to get your friend out of the house (i.e. getting law enforcement or the courts involved) and/or deciding to end the relationship with you.", "Yes YTA. For the life of me I don't understand spouses who don't put their partners first. He specifically did not want this person in the home and yet you did it anyways. Who's more important to you your friend or your husband.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. OP, this is his home also. You dont get to unilaterally decide major decisions like who gets to move in. Would you like it if he moved someone you couldn't stand into the house? YTA - a really bad decision.", "I only disagree with this because of her intent. You can love someone and make a mistake. She went behind his back and has to take responsibility for this decision she made and if the consequence is their marriage failing then that's their reality. \nShe made this decision out of a harsh reality her friend was living in and while she should have considered other options to help her friend it doesn't mean she doesn't love her fianc\u00e9. You can love two people and prioritize someone who is in jeopardy over someone who won't even be home and still has a problem with it. \nIt isn't her home however which is why I do stand strong it's her mess she needs to clean up, he doesn't want someone else in his home when he isn't there. Just like she wouldn't be comfortable with him dropping one of his friends off without consulting her (even though it's HIS place technically) that's just boundaries in any healthy relationship.", "Yeah, she definitely deserves to be stuck in an abusive relationship because she looked out for her friend in college and hurt someone's feelings doing it /s", "She's immature because she yelled at him once in college? Maybe you could say that she was immature but it sounds like it happened once and that it has been several years since that time. Arguably, holding onto that grudge to the point that the husband is refusing to let the friend stay temporarily to get out of an abusive relationship while he's not even there is more immature than being rude once to your friends college boyfriend.", "It's not OP's house, she has no right to let her friend move in when her fiance said they couldn't. OP isn't the only option the friend has. Don't say some dumb shit like \" I'd reconsider the marriage if my partner didn't allow it\" she asked for his opinion, got it and then completely ignored it. The friend was toxic to him and once again it's his house, doesn't matter if he's not there during the time the friend stays there, if anyone should be reconsidering the marriage is OP's fianc\u00e9 not the person that disregards their SO's opinion and feelings.", "Right. If the edit to this post is \u201cmy friend went back to an abusive home bc she was facing homelessness and now she\u2019s in the hospital from DV\u201d everyone saying Y-T-A would feel like A themselves.

He\u2019s paying his rent/mortgage and probably the utilities as well which means he is paying for her to live there already. He told her no. Full stop. Don\u2019t pass go. Don\u2019t collect $200. That woman is now trespassing and he might even be able to call the cops and charge her wirh trespassing. I don\u2019t know. All I can tell you is that if she loved and respected her fianc\u00e9 she would not have moved someone into HIS legal home (which she had zero legs rights to). Full stop. It doesn\u2019t matter what my friends say/do. If my husband said they couldn\u2019t move in...I would find a way to help them that didn\u2019t involve moving them into a home I share with my husband. Even if he\u2019s out of town. Why? Bc I love and respect him. She could have helped her friend find a woman\u2019s shelter. She could have worked with local churches or non profits to find a place for her friend. Where are the friend\u2019s family? Why can\u2019t she go to a parents house or an aunt or sibling? Find a studio apartment that fits one and help cover the bills? Help her apply for govt assistance? Help her friend file for a restraining order against the husband? The only reason to move her out quickly is due to abuse right? If there wasn\u2019t abuse and the friend just was tired of the marriage they had time to work on accommodations. They had time to both save up money. OP said her friend felt stuck. Not that the friend was being abused (unless that was in a later comment).

Most people would not allow their jobless friend to move into their house for free while adding to the bills.  Also, OP is not actually a good friend.  She allowed her friend to move in and file for divorce knowing the fiance could throw them both out the moment he found out and that is likely.  This was a bigger mess waiting to happen.\n\nIt is also extremely easy for OP to be empathetic since she is doing with someone else's money and house without their consent.  If she wants to help her friend, then she needs to help her friend.  But her fiance should not have to foot the bill.  Plus, when he wouldn't she stole from him (moving in the friend adds bills, takes up space and costs $$$ since he may have to hire a lawyer to evict. Etc)\n\nOP is treating her fiance like an atm and that is wrong.  He needs to break up with her.", "I agree with you, through the downvotes. Her other comments have said the friends bf was abusive, and the friend had once yelled at the fiance because she thought he was taking advantage of op, so now he doesn't like her.  big whoop. That doesn't compare to the current situation. I don't know \"why help a good friend in an abusive situation get away while you are living alone \"(in a house your husband owns but isn't there half the time) is so controversial.  It is also her home. There are no reasons to think your friend fleeing will call squatters rights. That's just so jaded.  I would help my friends in a second.", "I see what you\u2019re saying.

What happens when they are??\n\nIt\u2019s not wrong to want to help someone in need, especially your friends and loved ones. But it\u2019s not his responsibility to save her.

I wouldn\u2019t have brought the friend over after he said no, because it doesn\u2019t matter how unreasonable someone\u2019s being if it\u2019s their house you have to respect their rules. But I think he\u2019s being unreasonable and raising some red flags that would yes have me reconsidering the marriage.\n\nEdit because I missed your comment about the friend being toxic on my first read through: protecting your friend from a toxic relationship isn\u2019t actually toxic, surprisingly.

Compleltey agree with you except I don't personally know how they feel because not only do I not know the couple I'm not them. I can't say if she loves him or not.

If I just straight up didn\u2019t like them because of our own personal issues, I wouldn\u2019t care because I wouldn\u2019t have to talk to them or deal with them.

It doesn't mean she doesn't love him. If she burns her friend and she has by putting ALL of them in this situation, does she not love her friend? Even if she did all of this for that love? This sounds like stupidity on her end and from her perspective making the best of two bad situations. I feel intent does matter in this situation. People don't stop loving one another when they hurt each other and the things you are describing sounds one way or the highway. If things like this are a pattern then yeah I'd be more inclined to believe she's a selfish individual and isn't doing things out of love. But she did this out of love. Her love for him doesn't stop where her love for her friends starts is where I'm coming from. Maybe I am being naive? I'm not trying to say I understand compleltey I'm just saying you're making statements that seem quite certain when we don't know everything about the OP or her relationship. You wanna talk legality and money, talk. Don't say someone doesn't love someone because they made a stupid decision with unforseen consequences. Being ignorant isn't the same as not loving someone."]}
