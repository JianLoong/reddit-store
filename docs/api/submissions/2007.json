If someone is going to be staying there, it needs to be okay with both of you.\n\nWhile it's great that you were trying to help your friend, you shouldn't have insisted on housing her in your home after your fiance expressed his discomfort.

No one should be bringing in someone who has hurt their partner into their shared home. No one should have their safe place violated by person who is toxic to them. \n\nThis is his home he\u2019s created with or with out you. It\u2019s where him comes to relax, to feel safe. Homes are not just shelter they often act like a massive safety blanket to those who live there. It is no longer his safety blanket. It\u2019s no longer a place he feels he can relax because the one person who attacked him and never apologised has invaded his space with his fianc\u00e9s permission. Someone he should be able to trust. \nSounds like this friend wants to leave her toxic husband and you have never called out or defended your partner against the actions that hurt him. She called him a shitty person in public. She doesn\u2019t get to live in his house with out his permission.\n\nThere is plenty of ways you could have assisted her during this time that didn\u2019t involve lying to your partner, breaking a firm boundary and making him financially responsible for another person. Those actions have made you the toxic person to him. You\u2019ve violated his trust, his money, his home, his emotional well-being and his boundaries. \n\nYou friend sounds shitty too. She never apologised. Moved in with you knowing how they both feel about each other and didn\u2019t even reach out to apologise and thank him for the roof over her head? \n\nCongratulations instead of offering to help pay for some of her rent elsewhere, taking her to a shelter or helping her secure a place and job away from her ex you both bit the hand that feeds you. \n\nAlso did it ever occur to you that fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t want you alone in a house with a woman fleeing DV?

You went behind your fiance's back to give your friend a place to stay, that is wrong.

I've been that woman, trying to escape a horrible and abusive marriage, and if a friend of mine wouldn't let me stay based  soley on their SO's dislike of me...that person would no longer be my friend.", "YTA. Having anyone else living in your home even for a few days requires discussion and agreement between all parties, especially when the guest will be there \"for a few months\".  You have likely lost your fiance's trust.  And im sure you would not like it if your fiance had a friend you didnt like or want in your home, and he disregarded your feelings and allowed his friend to move in for months.  A person's home is their sanctuary and if your fiance doesn't like  your friend, he will be uncomfortable in his own home and that isnt right.   I know you had good intentions to help your friend, but if her husband is truly abusive, you are placing yourself and your fiance in danger by allowing her to stay in your home.

I\u2019m glad she realized that. But the man you plan on marrying said no. This is an all or nothing situation. He is paying the bills. He decides who lives there jointly with you. How about he moves in a friend who needed help? I mean he doesn\u2019t even need to ask bc it doesn\u2019t matter what you say. You made a promise you couldn\u2019t keep. You were wrong. I would start looking at options. If she has a job she needs to find a place to stay and quickly. Maybe you should pay for her first month\u2019s rent since you assured her you would make sure she has a place to live. I was going to say not the a thinking a week or two but you promised her almost half a YEAR!!!", "YTA, and to be honest I'm surprised he isn't telling you to leave with her.

You have no respect for him, or his boundaries. You need to help her find a room to rent somewhere, or she can go to a shelter for abused women. You created this mess with your lies. I hope your fiance dumps you and finds a more honest partner who shows him some respect. I hope your tears and manipulative tactics don't work on him.", "YTA.  Your fiance said know. He owns the house.  Good luck finding a new place to live if you don't tell your friend to leave, as you will find yourself homeless and single too.  You've shown your fiance you don't respect him, so he will be rethinking your relationship at this point.", "Yta not only you let her stay after he told you not to. You also manipulation your finance to get you way by crying. Maybe when your single you and best friend can get your own place together. Cause obviously she means more then your fianc\u00e9 to you and his opinions.\nEdited to add. It's actually his home he didn't want her in I would kick you both out your a bad fianc\u00e9.", "YTA so badly.... just think maybe in a few months you and your friend can be roomies somewhere together when you both get booted out.

Such women seem to make sport of degrading the husband and trying to convince the wife she would be improving her life by looking outside the marriage.\n\nIf it was just because I plain didn't like her personality, I would agree under the condition that I show her respect in my house and she shows me the same.  My wife and I actually rescued a woman in a similar situation, my wife ended up putting her out because she treated me like absolute garbage with the assumption that she is my wife's friend and there is nothing we would do about it.

Most ppl would throw you both out", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say NTA. If the friend really is being abused and OPs husband isn\u2019t even around for 5 months he should have said ok. Fair enough if he was at home too but to turn away OPs friend from an abusive situation when he\u2019s not even around just seems too far. What does it matter to him if she\u2019s there while he\u2019s gone? As long as she moves out before he comes home I don\u2019t see why he\u2019s being so harsh about it. \n\nI wonder if the friend had posted on Reddit describing how she\u2019s being abused and how her friends husband is away for 5 months but won\u2019t let her stay there and she has no where else to go - how many redditors would be calling him the asshole then \ud83d\ude43", "YTA", "YTA-What is WRONG with you? Why couldn't you respect your husband wishes? Why couldn't you respect your shared HOME? Your friend doesn't have any other family/friends? Give her money to stay somewhere else, or support her in other ways. Help her get her help/resources. If I were your husband I wouldn't trust you. Your also a manipulation the situation by crying when you knew you were wrong. Keep pushing your husband like that and eventually your friend will be helping you through your own divorce IF you get married.  And who cares what she thinks about him when you were in college? People can't change?", "NTA. Going against the grain here, but my bestie had to leave an abusive marriage and I was happy to be able to help by giving her a place to stay. It's not like you're inviting her in for a fun vacation - you're stepping up in a crisis. You know how fucking dangerous it is to leave an abuser? I do! She does! You do! Why doesn't your man?\n\nI think it's pretty fucked that your boyfriend is holding a grudge from years ago about her calling him out for treating you badly. Was he? And if he wasn't, has he really not been able to dig deep and consider that however ill-advised her behavior was, it was in defense of you because she loves you? And he still can't get over it in a situation like: she needs a safe place to live so she can leave an abuser? He's not even in the house for pete's sake. That's a lack of empathy that is a flag to me.\n\nFrankly I'd move out and throw in with your friend to rent a place together. You can decide whether or not you want to stay with him without worrying about getting kicked out, you can protect your friend, and maybe you can get a little space from a guy who has the empathy of a coke bottle.", "YTA.

This is just a power display for him to ensure that he will be served in the marriage. Don't waste your life for this heartless AH.", "ESH, but YTH I completely understand your desire to help your friend, My wife has friends I don't particularly like but I wouldn't refuse to help them if they were in a toxic relationship, bad situation.

He has every right to say yes or no to ANYONE living there. Third, ya he does have a right to hold this grudge against her. Rather than have a civilized conversation about her concerns she yelled at him in public? And hasn\u2019t even apologized as it seems because neither party likes each other still.

You thought you would get away with it because he was overseas, but SURPRISE!\n\nNow it is what it is and you own her and your decision to put her up.  You should be sincerely apologizing to your fiance for putting him in this position, and ask him what your friend can do to atone for humiliating him those years ago as well as what you can do to atone for not respecting his wishes in your shared home.
