No one should be bringing in someone who has hurt their partner into their shared home. No one should have their safe place violated by person who is toxic to them. \n\nThis is his home he\u2019s created with or with out you. It\u2019s where him comes to relax, to feel safe. Homes are not just shelter they often act like a massive safety blanket to those who live there. It is no longer his safety blanket. It\u2019s no longer a place he feels he can relax because the one person who attacked him and never apologised has invaded his space with his fianc\u00e9s permission. Someone he should be able to trust. \nSounds like this friend wants to leave her toxic husband and you have never called out or defended your partner against the actions that hurt him. She called him a shitty person in public. She doesn\u2019t get to live in his house with out his permission.\n\nThere is plenty of ways you could have assisted her during this time that didn\u2019t involve lying to your partner, breaking a firm boundary and making him financially responsible for another person. Those actions have made you the toxic person to him. You\u2019ve violated his trust, his money, his home, his emotional well-being and his boundaries. \n\nYou friend sounds shitty too. She never apologised. Moved in with you knowing how they both feel about each other and didn\u2019t even reach out to apologise and thank him for the roof over her head? \n\nCongratulations instead of offering to help pay for some of her rent elsewhere, taking her to a shelter or helping her secure a place and job away from her ex you both bit the hand that feeds you. \n\nAlso did it ever occur to you that fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t want you alone in a house with a woman fleeing DV?

You went behind your fiance's back to give your friend a place to stay, that is wrong.

I've been that woman, trying to escape a horrible and abusive marriage, and if a friend of mine wouldn't let me stay based  soley on their SO's dislike of me...that person would no longer be my friend.", "YTA. Having anyone else living in your home even for a few days requires discussion and agreement between all parties, especially when the guest will be there \"for a few months\".  You have likely lost your fiance's trust.  And im sure you would not like it if your fiance had a friend you didnt like or want in your home, and he disregarded your feelings and allowed his friend to move in for months.  A person's home is their sanctuary and if your fiance doesn't like  your friend, he will be uncomfortable in his own home and that isnt right.   I know you had good intentions to help your friend, but if her husband is truly abusive, you are placing yourself and your fiance in danger by allowing her to stay in your home.

I\u2019m glad she realized that. But the man you plan on marrying said no. This is an all or nothing situation. He is paying the bills. He decides who lives there jointly with you. How about he moves in a friend who needed help? I mean he doesn\u2019t even need to ask bc it doesn\u2019t matter what you say. You made a promise you couldn\u2019t keep. You were wrong. I would start looking at options. If she has a job she needs to find a place to stay and quickly. Maybe you should pay for her first month\u2019s rent since you assured her you would make sure she has a place to live. I was going to say not the a thinking a week or two but you promised her almost half a YEAR!!!", "YTA, and to be honest I'm surprised he isn't telling you to leave with her.

You have no respect for him, or his boundaries. You need to help her find a room to rent somewhere, or she can go to a shelter for abused women. You created this mess with your lies. I hope your fiance dumps you and finds a more honest partner who shows him some respect. I hope your tears and manipulative tactics don't work on him.", "YTA.  Your fiance said know. He owns the house.  Good luck finding a new place to live if you don't tell your friend to leave, as you will find yourself homeless and single too.  You've shown your fiance you don't respect him, so he will be rethinking your relationship at this point.", "Yta not only you let her stay after he told you not to. You also manipulation your finance to get you way by crying. Maybe when your single you and best friend can get your own place together.

It's actually his home he didn't want her in I would kick you both out your a bad fianc\u00e9.", "YTA so badly.... just think maybe in a few months you and your friend can be roomies somewhere together when you both get booted out.

Such women seem to make sport of degrading the husband and trying to convince the wife she would be improving her life by looking outside the marriage.\n\nIf it was just because I plain didn't like her personality, I would agree under the condition that I show her respect in my house and she shows me the same.  My wife and I actually rescued a woman in a similar situation, my wife ended up putting her out because she treated me like absolute garbage with the assumption that she is my wife's friend and there is nothing we would do about it.

Most ppl would throw you both out", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say NTA. If the friend really is being abused and OPs husband isn\u2019t even around for 5 months he should have said ok. Fair enough if he was at home too but to turn away OPs friend from an abusive situation when he\u2019s not even around just seems too far. What does it matter to him if she\u2019s there while he\u2019s gone? As long as she moves out before he comes home I don\u2019t see why he\u2019s being so harsh about it. \n\nI wonder if the friend had posted on Reddit describing how she\u2019s being abused and how her friends husband is away for 5 months but won\u2019t let her stay there and she has no where else to go - how many redditors would be calling him the asshole then \ud83d\ude43", "YTA", "YTA-What is WRONG with you? Why couldn't you respect your husband wishes? Why couldn't you respect your shared HOME? Your friend doesn't have any other family/friends? Give her money to stay somewhere else, or support her in other ways. Help her get her help/resources. If I were your husband I wouldn't trust you. Your also a manipulation the situation by crying when you knew you were wrong. Keep pushing your husband like that and eventually your friend will be helping you through your own divorce IF you get married.  And who cares what she thinks about him when you were in college? People can't change?", "NTA. Going against the grain here, but my bestie had to leave an abusive marriage and I was happy to be able to help by giving her a place to stay. It's not like you're inviting her in for a fun vacation - you're stepping up in a crisis. You know how fucking dangerous it is to leave an abuser? I do! She does! You do! Why doesn't your man?\n\nI think it's pretty fucked that your boyfriend is holding a grudge from years ago about her calling him out for treating you badly. Was he? And if he wasn't, has he really not been able to dig deep and consider that however ill-advised her behavior was, it was in defense of you because she loves you? And he still can't get over it in a situation like: she needs a safe place to live so she can leave an abuser? He's not even in the house for pete's sake. That's a lack of empathy that is a flag to me.\n\nFrankly I'd move out and throw in with your friend to rent a place together. You can decide whether or not you want to stay with him without worrying about getting kicked out, you can protect your friend, and maybe you can get a little space from a guy who has the empathy of a coke bottle.", "YTA.

She went behind his back and has to take responsibility for this decision she made and if the consequence is their marriage failing then that's their reality. \nShe made this decision out of a harsh reality her friend was living in and while she should have considered other options to help her friend it doesn't mean she doesn't love her fianc\u00e9. You can love two people and prioritize someone who is in jeopardy over someone who won't even be home and still has a problem with it. \nIt isn't her home however which is why I do stand strong it's her mess she needs to clean up, he doesn't want someone else in his home when he isn't there.

Maybe you could say that she was immature but it sounds like it happened once and that it has been several years since that time.

OP isn't the only option the friend has. Don't say some dumb shit like \" I'd reconsider the marriage if my partner didn't allow it\" she asked for his opinion, got it and then completely ignored it. The friend was toxic to him and once again it's his house, doesn't matter if he's not there during the time the friend stays there, if anyone should be reconsidering the marriage is OP's fianc\u00e9 not the person that disregards their SO's opinion and feelings.", "Right.

If there wasn\u2019t abuse and the friend just was tired of the marriage they had time to work on accommodations. They had time to both save up money. OP said her friend felt stuck.

This was a bigger mess waiting to happen.\n\nIt is also extremely easy for OP to be empathetic since she is doing with someone else's money and house without their consent.

He won't let you help your friend escape an abusive situation because she yelled at him once YEARS ago?? He's been holding a grudge for that long?? He thinks that petty beef is enough reason keep her in an abusive home with her husband?  Shame on him. That's so wildly unempathetic that it's ridiculous.  Especially when you consider that he won't even be there to deal with her. Honestly OP I'm not one to say people should just get divorced but I'd be very concerned if I were you.  He's showing you who he is right now and it's not a nice person.  \n\n\nIn a normal situation he'd be well within his rights to say no and you'd be the AH, but this is an extenuating  circumstance. Your friend may not be all the way divorced in 5 months but she can definitely get a job, set up a separate bank account, and get an apartment in that time.  So it's very likely that she'll be gone by the time he gets home.  I just can't understand what his problem is with her staying while he's away? \n\n\nThe only a few reasons I can think of for him to say no considering he won't be living there while she's there:\n\n1. He doesn't think the abuse is that serious. He thinks that she can figure it out on her own because the situation isn't that deep.\n\n2. He thinks she deserves it for some reason.  \n\n3. He's really letting an argument from years ago cloud his judgements\n\n4. He's actually just not a nice or empathetic  person. He thinks the situation is serious but he doesn't care and since he doesn't like her anyways she can just get fucked \n\n\nI think it's most likely that it's some combination of all of these reasons but OP you should be most concerned if it turns out to be the 4th and you should honestly evaluate who you're planning to shackle yourself to so that you don't end up like your friend. \n\n\nThere's too many terrible stories of women marrying guys who seemed to be great people until they got married. That's probably what happened with your friend.  Her husband was most likely a great dude until they got married.  Your fiance is waving a red flag \ud83d\udea9  at you quite vigorously.  You need to evaluate what it could mean for your future to marry a man who's OK with turning away an abuse victim that he not only knows but is also his fianc\u00e9's best friend.  Especially when it would cost him nothing to help her.\n\n\nEdit: for those who don't know.\n\nOPs fiance used to make plans with her and then cancel them at the last minute to hang with his friends causing OP distress and to feel as if he didn't really care about OP. After this happened a bunch of times OPs friend yelled at him and call him out on his bullshit and about how he was taking OP for granted. After which he (according to OP) got his act together and their relationship survived hence the  engagement.\n\nOP considering this new information.  He really doesn't have ANY reason to not like your friend.  And your friend seems like one of the best to have. Having someone who's not only in your corner but willing to put themselves out there to defend you is irreplaceable. With a friend like that there's only a couple of reasons I can think of that explains why she still doesn't like your fiance:\n\n1. He hasn't actually changed and he still takes you for granted. \n\n2. There's some other issues with your fiance and the way he treats you that you're deluding yourself about and refusing to see clearly.  \n\nAgain OP please evaluate your relationship.  Talk to your friend ask her why she doesn't like your fiance and he open to hearing the honest answers. Then take those answers and evaluate to see if there's any merit BEFORE you get married.

A women\u2019s shelter could be the answer but it isn\u2019t the only RIGHT answer. Leaving is super hard, stressful and dangerous and if I ever found myself in that situation again I would hope I had a friend like OP. A friend that took my actual life above their partner\u2019s petty immaturity and grudge and stood up to them to give me a space place. This is why domestic abuse physical and/or mental is so stigmatized making it harder for anyone to get out of a situation. \n\nHonestly, I hope OP evaluates her relationship with her fianc\u00e9 be he is definitely an AH and the fact that he is holding on to a grudge for being \u201ccalled out\u201d leads me to think there is truth to his behavior that the friend was able to see that OP has or is ignoring. \n\nAnd I get it, lying or withholding information from your partner is bad, but if it\u2019s to save a life (which no one on here will ever know the true gravity of OP\u2019s friends situation, not even OP) then lying is the right thing to do.

Cuz her intention was to wrong her fiance", "The part that stuck out to me was she asked him, he said no, but she still did it anyway. That's a huge breach of trust. And when he tried to get her to leave, she cried and begged him not to, manipulating him using tears. What happens with a similar situation? She wants to buy a pet. He says no. She does it anyway but when he tries to return the pet she uses tears to make him stop. It's not the same severity but the same principle applies. Crying and begging to get what you want. When you let someone move in, it needs approval from the members of the household. \n\n\nHe's an AH for turning away a person in need. But not an AH for wanting someone out in his home. It's his house, and he pays the bills. If I'm not using anything and I don't want to give it away, then it's my right not to. \n\n\nHe didn't tell her not to help. He just didn't want her in his home. If his fiance was that abusive, what makes his home more safe than women's shelters built for situations like this? Unless they have guns, a high wall with barbed wires, huge guard dogs, or unless OP lives hours away from abusive husband, it's two women living alone and it's not gonna much of a difference. And if it was only for a short period of time. But OP's friend moves out next year. That's not a short period of time. If she had the resources to help, she should have used that. Not her fianc\u00e8s. If someone is in need, you do not volunteer resources you do not own. For example, if you live with your parents, you do not move someone in without their permission. You do not grant someone's wish if it is not in your power.\n\n\nLike other people have pointed out, it sucks that her husband didn't help, but OP could have helped her friend in some way. If a friend is broke, you do not give them money if you are broke yourself. Some people empathize deeply with their friends in trouble but they do not offer their resources if they don't have them. They help find employment, find other sources of money. It is not OP's space, it is her fianc\u00e8's space.\n\n\nAs for the red flag, if the fianc\u00e8 thinks this is too much of a breach of trust, he'll kick them both out. \n\n\nAlso, OP says friend doesn't badmouth fianc\u00e8 to her because friend knows she doesn't like it.

Yes, she lied and snuck around but she did it because her best friend was in a dangerous situation and needed her help. It\u2019s not always easy to find or get into a shelter, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to think clearly when the stakes are high. But he had all the means to help at no cost to himself and he never would have had to talk to her or be around her. He said no because he\u2019s still angry about something that happened *years* ago and can\u2019t put his ego aside for half a second to help someone in need. She made some AH choices but he is an AH as a person.", "So I have a few counter point.\n\nFirst about the whole dog situation. I've already addressed that. In that situation OP would be the AH but this situation is an extenuating circumstance considering OPs friend was being abused by her husband. That means that normal rules don't apply in the same way. \n\nI think OP asked her fiance because she thought he'd be OK with it. As her and I both see it. There's no real reason for him to say no since he won't be there while OPs friend is there. And my whole post is about how it's fucked up for him to have said no. Again it's an extenuating circumstance.  When OPs fiance says no there isn't a whole lot of alternatives. Deciding to move the friend in anyways is excusable given the circumstances. \n\nI think you're confused about a number of things.  \n\n\n1. Being abusive doesn't always mean he's going to chase the friend down and snatch her up in front of people or even do it knowing other people know where she's supposed to be at. I think instead of assuming there we can leave level of danger calculations up to OP and her friend. So while a women's shelter might be safer (which is debatable but idk enough about women's shelter statistics or anything to speak to that) it certainly isn't nicer than staying with your friend. Hence if danger levels are low then obviously staying with a friend vs. a shelter is the clear choice. \n\n\n2. I would cry if I were in the same situation.  It's not manipulative unless she has a masterful control over her tears and is using fake tears to get him to comply.  Crying because you're upset is not manipulative. Crying because you're upset that a certain thing might happen and asking for that thing to not happen is also not manipulative.  Now of course it might sway someone's opinion/behavior but I see having mal intent or a history of behavior as a requirement before I call someone manipulative. When a child cries or throws a tantrum to get what they want thats not being manipulative because they can't control their behavior. Same with OP, crying is not manipulative because she (presumably) can't control her tears. \n\n\n3. It doesn't matter that this is the fianc\u00e9's house. If we're speaking to legalities then OP has just as many rights to it as he does at this point so unless he had her sign a lease that forbids OP from temporarily moving in guests, then OP is not \"broke\". She has the resources to help her friend.  In fact she has an excess of resources because her fiance won't even be living with them. \n\n\n4. OPs fiance can do what he wants. Again I'm concerned that he is the type of person that would kick OP and her friend out over this. That's why I'm asking OP to really do her due diligence with this relationship before she says \"I do\". If kindness, Empathy,  understanding, or anything like that is important for her partner to have then it doesn't seem like her current fiance has a whole lot of any of that.  I may be wrong of course can't truly judge a person from a single post but again that's why I'm pressing OP to evaluate it herself and make her own judgements.", "IT's His house! Not OP's!\n\nHe doesn't like the friend. Doesn't want her in HIS house!

And not only is this the common denominator; it is also the only variable they we have any control over.\n\nYou can call it blame or fault. I call it taking personal responsibility. There are ways to avoid abusive relationships, or at least recognize one and leave quickly. The mindset of victims fails to recognize this. Consequently, there is never any realistic hope for something better.", "First of all literally two comments up OP says her friend yelled at him after she caught OP crying over him.

OP is a willing participant in this relationship and is incumbent on her to fix this relationship as well.", "I disagree with your point. I think if OPs friend was right in calling him out and his wake up from being called out is what saved his relationship then there's no reason for him to still be holding a grudge.

Unless the friend has some major issue, or disrespectful to the fianc\u00e9 or OP, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable for the fianc\u00e9 to say no. I think both should be free to do what they like. They\u2019re not staying with their parents. They should have autonomy to invite whoever they like to stay provided they don\u2019t inconvenience the other party. \n\nMaybe I don\u2019t have the words to explain it but I can give examples. In my home (my husband bought it) that I share with my husband, there isn\u2019t a no you can\u2019t do that in our house thing. You are free to invite anyone over, anyone can stay over, you can have parties, whatever you want you can it. No one needs to ask for permission because it\u2019s always a yes. We tell each other what we want to do or if we are unsure we\u2019ll chat about it. But both of us are free to make decisions regarding our house. But we wouldn\u2019t expect each other to be forced to contribute to our decisions. Say my husband wants to throw a party, he\u2019s free to do it and if I want to help him get it ready I can but if I don\u2019t want to then that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s never I wanna throw a party but you need to help. So there\u2019s no reason to say no. I dog sat for my sister even though my husband is scared of dogs. So we designate areas for the dog and my husband won\u2019t go to where the dog is if he doesn\u2019t feel like it. He is not expected to help me with the dog. But he would never say no to helping my sister out and even though it is a minor inconvenience for him, he\u2019ll always be on board for things that are important to me. Same for me. I\u2019ll always be on board for anything that\u2019s important to him. \n\nObviously we are very mindful of each other\u2019s feelings and comfort and we have to have good communication for things to work.

I hope you are never in the position where you need help and there is no place to go.", "I think it's a US thing, and they don't live there", "Yes I do believe it would go YTA no matter the sex.  I also believe there is a high probability that either sex will turn to the double standard of \"it isn't the same\" line.  Seen it plenty of times on this sub.  Wanting to help the friend isn't the issue the lying and going behind their back cause they are not there part is for me and many others.", "I didn\u2019t see where it says that she\u2019s been insulting him for years. She yelled at him one time in university for being bad to her friend. How is that years????", "Oh and if you hadn't seen it yet, OP is confident her fianc\u00e8 won't break up with her or kick her out, that he loves her too much to end their relationship. I don't know what that sounds to you, but to me OP knew exactly what she's doing. She's gonna go ahead and do what she wants because she \"knows\" he's not gonna leave her. We don't know if he told her that but she says she knows. That YTA just multiplied into infinity.", "We can ask OP's fianc\u00e8 the same thing, really. Do you really want to marry a woman who does what she wants, lies to your face about it, just hoping you don't find out, even if you said no? Would you be able to trust her not doing it again? Tbh that's all that boils down to it. \n\n\nOP lied to fianc\u00e8. It's for a good reason, but she lied and just hoped he wouldn't find out. OP is a very good friend but a terrible partner. But the question is, is she an AH for letting someone stay with her (in his house) even when her fianc\u00e8 said no? Yes she is. Is she the AH for helping her friend despite her fianc\u00e8 saying no? No she's not. \n\n\nI get what you're saying about circumstances. It'll be understandable if she only offered for a short period of time (a few weeks, a month) Because it was an emergency. But she offered for an indefinite period of time (until she saves up is relative, latest comment from OP is until January). They don't seem to be from the US, and other commenters were worried about squatters rights. If friend stays until in a period of time, fianc\u00e8 won't be able to kick her out without legal process. That costs time and money. I don't know if the place they live in has something similiar. \n\n\n\nIf not, then the next question would be, what if she doesn't save up? She still has nowhere to go in January? OP for now doesn't seem to have an answer to that. The post implies friend has been living there for quite some time. Her plan supposedly is \n\na/ ask fianc\u00e8 \n\nb/ if A doesn't work, lie to fianc\u00e8 and hope he doesn't find out \n\nc/ hope friend saves up in the meantime. \n\n\nPersonally OP sounds to me like she doesn't want to lose face. She said she couldn't stand doing nothing. The first thing she thought of was to offer her fianc\u00e8's home? There are government resources for this. Women's shelters. DV hotlines. Or if she has plenty of resources, she could have lent her money. Rent a place for friend to stay and OP will pay for it herself. Refer her to people who can help her. What about her family? Her friends? I get that abusive people isolate their victims, but did she exhaust any other solution? She never thought of something that will respect her fianc\u00e8's no and help her friend at the same time? Was it ONLY move in with me or stay in the abusive relationship? That's what we are saying. The ONLY possible choice was to live in her house? \n\n\nFriend only agreed to divorce because OP offered something she doesn't own. Kicking the friend out would, in a sense humiliate OP. Never mind that OP describes friend as still disliking fianc\u00e8, badmouths him, never apologized to him so why would you let someone who disrespects you live in your home? Even if you aren't there? Did she even try to make amends knowing she's living in his property? \n\n\nAlso, yes OP can move in who they want, but unless her name is on the title, then the fianc\u00e8 can kick both of them out. Even if OP paid for bills etc etc etc but she still doesn't own the house, she can still be kicked out because she doesn't own the property. Refusing to leave would be trespassing. (Also why people argue over titles, property and the like because if your name isn't on it, or you aren't named the owner, you can't have it.)\n\n\nIf OP was sure of her decision and commitment to help her friend and stands by it, then she wouldn't be here. If she's an AH for helping a life, then so be it right? She saved a life. Instead she's here commenting and defending herself, trying to make herself sound better. \n\n\nAlso: YTA 1000X. You are a good friend and you chose your friend over your partner. You CANNOT expect there will be no fallouts. Maybe you two can buy an apartment together if he kicks you both out.", "Thank you. Tenants rights apply just as much for \u201cguests\u201d who don\u2019t pay rent but have been living there & receiving mail for 30 days or more", "Tenants rights isnt correct either but i guess it could be different depending on the state but im pretty sure that if you dont have a lease or pay any rent you dont have tenant rights, at least in my state. And per my knowledge of the post the friend is just staying there, not renting it so she wouldn\u2019t have tenant rights.", "yeah i get that but in this case, the friend never got permission, right? The owner explicitly denied her access. So why would protection apply to her?", "In the Netherlands we have something called \"anti-kraak\", which is basically the municipal government allowing people to live in run down buildings for a very low rent to prevent people from illegally living there instead. All to prevent those buildings from becoming drugs dens etc. But you do not get any notice when the government decides to level the building. You are just told to leave and that's that.\n\nI know it is not exactly the same as squatting, but I suppose it has some similarities.", "Squatters rights is kind of a generic term in a case like this it would fall under tenant rights.  From what I understand in most places in the US if someone lives in a house for longer than X amount of days and meet some other criteria like receiving mail at the address they are no longer considered a guest but are considered a tenant.   At this point the person can refuse to leave and must be subject to a formal evection process which can take a long time.      There was a verbal contract of sorts, friend was told they could live there for X number of months, friend moved in and presumably stopped looking for another place to stay but is now being asked to leave.  The terms of the agreement changed.", "To respond to your points in order. \n\n\nYou're right you can ask OPs fiance about the mishandling of trust.  And again he's within his rights to decide to that it's a deal breaker.  Maybe for him he wants his partner to treat his word as law if he says no then they say no and vice versa.  That's OK for him to want.  I think that considering this circumstance that the idea that he says no so they both say no might have been untenable if OP cares about her friend and wants her to be safe.  That's why I think if he makes that choice based on this situation it would show his lack of empathy and understanding. \n\n\nOP definitely lied. You're also right about that but again I believe that lying for this reason in this circumstance is understandable.  Lying for a good reason is infinitely more excusable than any other form of lying and it's very hard to find a good reason to lie. This is one of the few examples.  So again given the circumstances we come to your question. In this situation you can't remove the circumstances from the question of of she's the AH. If things remained the same but friend is not in an abusive situation then i would also say she's Y T A, but that isn't what's happening here. When you add in the abuse she becomes NTA. So again I will always come back to the extenuating circumstance that and the fact that OPs fiance will be away are literally the only reasons she's NTA in this situation.  \n\n\nAlso to address OP being a bad partner.  Her fiance is also being a bad partner.  They're both not really working together imo. It sucks that she's lied to him and chosen her friend over what he wants but at the same time he's chosen what he wants over his fianc\u00e9's need to help someone she's close too. They're both not acting in their partners best interest but OP at least has a good reason. Her fiance (from what I can tell) really doesn't have a good reason to refuse OPs request because he won't even be there.  \n\n\nYou've made a good point about the length of the stay.  I'm assuming that OPs friend can be gone within the 5 months that the fiance is out of town. If it becomes clear that OPs friend is not working towards that goal then at the time that OP understands that and does not address it then OP will become the AH despite the situation.  At that point it is OPs responsibility to ensure that her friend finds another avenue to address her problems.  Again one of the big reasons that she's NTA in my opinion is that she's not unduly burdening her fiance since he'll be away but when he comes home if she doesn't handle it quickly at that time then she'll the AH. She can't force her fiance to live with someone he doesn't like and that doesn't like him that would be unfair to her fiance.  Likewise if he was going to be living there from the jump I'd say she can't move someone in regardless of their circumstance for that same reason.\n\n\nI think moving in with OP might have been the fastest, simplest, and cheapest option at the time. But again, all of those other options are valid at this point now that she's been removed from her immediate situation. OPs friend should definitely be tapping these resources so that she can move out in a timely manner. \n\n\nIt might be humiliating for OP to kick her friend out but I doubt she's done all of this just to avoid humiliation. That would imply that she doesn't actually care too much about her friends circumstance when I think OP has made it clear that she's done this because of how much she cares about her friend. \n\n\nSo assuming no one here is an absolutely terrible person, then fiance can choose to kick them both out but I'd hope he'd give them a notice of a couple of months.  In the U.S. it's customary to give 2 months notice before an eviction idk where they're at but id hope he'd give them a similar notice if he decides this is the hair that breaks the camels back.  With that being said I don't think this situation warrants that sort of reaction at all. If that is indeed what happens I'd consider it as OP dodging a bullet. \n\nFinally I have no clue why OP is here seeking validation from the internet but she's really stuck between a rock and a hard place. Her fiance is unreasonably angry with her and her friend doesn't really have many options. If she complies with her fiance her friend won't have the time to set up a nice alternative and if she doesn't comply then her fiance will continue to be upset and it could jeopardize the entire relationship/ her future with this man. \n\nWhile I think the fiance is being harsh and unreasonable that doesn't change the fact that OP is really in a tough spot. \n\n\nSo from this whole thing it seems our differences lie in our different perspectives. It's not very often I can have a civilized disagreement with someone on the internet so I want to thank you for that but at this time I don't think there's anything you could say to change my opinion and I don't think there's anything I can say to change yours.  I believe we both have very valid and nuanced stances that are only different because we're looking at the same situation from different angles.  Like the whole 6 vs 9 thing we're both right.  I very much empathize with OP and I think you're really empathizing with her fiance.  \n\n\nSo you be great. Thanks again for the good talk.", "Yeah, it'll be highly dependant on where you live, your local laws. \n\nLike where I am, anyone who isn't living in a property they own is just automatically given tenant's rights and the basic protections of a lease. \n\nBut in general, this is a discussion about \"tenants\" way more than it's a discussion about \"squatters\".", "She let them stay.

I can just about guarantee, because I've seen it so many times, that she was the difficult friend while they were dating. Always caused drama, created issues where none were, and was just overall a bad friend, and the fiance saw this, but obviously OP did not. Now she goes behind his back to have someone in a house he owns, that he isn't comfortable with being there? There were other solutions to this than lying to her fiance. Hopefully the fiance wises up and calls off this wedding!", "Still I'm positive there's a good reason the man doesn't want her there. \nLike for all we know this freind could be a real shitty individual", "You are either missing or dismissing the part of OP's post that mentions that neither the Friend nor the Fiance liked each other BEFORE this all started.

You literally say in this comment \"someone makes a stupid decsisons\" again I feel like you didn't fully read what I said.

I don't love your idea of only transactional love because I don't think we are as simple as that. You just said it isn't a feeling it's only our actions and that makes no sense to me. You don't know what you're talking about because just like the rest of us you don't fully understand humans let alone a complex situation such as love. So just stop stating things as \"facts and legality\" when I keep trying to have a conversation and have acknowledged the legality and transactional problems in this situation. Love and money are different and this was an isolated scenario. Don't know how plainly you need to have it said.", "It\u2019s been 5 months. I\u2019d say 99 percent of the population wouldn\u2019t be okay with someone moving into their home for that long who doesn\u2019t pay bills. The friend is in a terrible spot I agree 100%. But a decision like this needs to be okayed by both people. He owns the home but they\u2019re going to get married and both live in it. So to me that means they both get 50:50 say. So if one person says no and the other says yes it means that the friend cannot move in. Decisions like these, just like having a kid should be 2 yes and 1 no. But that\u2019s just me.", "I hate having anyone in my house.

There's so many people out there who believe victims have done something to deserve the abuse they suffer.

That leaves OP ultimately in the same situation as her friend, trapped in a home with someone who potentially doesn't care about her, because she has nowhere to go and the world hates women who try to leave in the wrong way.\n\nIt's honestly been eye opening today.

Sounds like he believes she should have stayed in her abusive marriage or live on the streets and doesn't care at all.\n\nI think ultimately, you did what you thought was right in your heart. I don't think you were an AH on purpose, and I can't believe the votes that say you're the AH and he's completely innocent. Do not listen to them. They're probably men or children who have never experienced an abusive relationship or tried to help a friend out of one.
