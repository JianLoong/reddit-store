If they keep asking for more, then just hand them the whole bag and tell them to just keep it because you wrongfully thought it was a gift for you, and stand there looking as if the wind has been taken out of your sails.", "The gifts, really,  were never for you. They bought that stuff for themselves, knowing they come over to your house constantly. They just called it a gift, but it was for themselves.", "INFO:\n\nMaybe I'm too neurodivergent for this, but why can't you tell them no? Or take the food away once you notice? Then give a mild excuse like \"oh we were saving that one for *blah blah upcoming occasion*, let me grab the other one for you\"", "NTA", "As soon as they hand you a gift, hand it back and tell them that you're saving the effort and handing it back to them since they are going to eat it instead. \n\nThere really isn't any point in you keeping the gifts if they are going to eat it all.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA, but is there more going on, you seem to be overzealous about this.  I mean are you just going to make single cups of coffee in the corner, while also drinking your precious syrup, kind of sounds like you already upset about something else, and I am assuming probably personal space.  Best to actually talk about this instead of letting the trivial eat you up", "I don't know how to word this so it may come off wrong but are the gifts actually for you or things they bring back and bring over because they want you to try them also? My parents traveled all the time and would bring back various things and bring them over but it would be for everyone to eat/drink. We also knew this though so we wouldn't get mad when they were ate or drank.", "NTA but is it time to perhaps consider that they come as guests and stop helping themselves to whatever it is they want? If it otherwise works for you, ok.  But wow I\u2019d be annoyed if my in-laws or even my own parents felt so entitled to anything in my home and took without asking.", "Or just have one conversation where you mention you are the type to save and savor these types of gifts. \n\nGiven the interaction over the syrup, seems like op has never brought this up before. Mil seemed to think op didn't actually like the syrup since the small bottle hadn't been used up in months. They might have assumed the same with the mustard and were just trying to use it so it wouldn't go to waste.\n\nMil was curious about the famous coffee and asked to try a single cup - not a crime. Given she drinks keurig she might not have a regular machine, so it wouldn't have made sense to buy her own bag of beans.\n\nWhy take everything to the extreme and be passive aggressive or preemptively hide things?", "Random question, assuming \"fixing\" isn't a typo - I've never seen that usage of fixing and it's really cool. If that is what you meant to write, can you explain what it means and give me other examples? (Am a language nerd!)", "I think if they felt this way, they would just stop buying him consumable gifts.", "Thank goodness for a rational response. There are so few people with basic common sense and social skills on here giving advice. \n\nInlaws may be assuming op doesn't really like the gifts so they are just trying to use them up. This is so easy to clear up without the rude comments when inlaws are feeding your kid breakfast.", "Too be fair, most people probably wouldn\u2019t be able to taste the difference", "When you give someone a gift what they do with it is none of your business - whether they use it immediately or leave it in a cupboard for a year.  If you're in someone's kitchen you only use foodstuffs that are plentiful and in common use, not small bottles from foreign countries that can't be easily replaced.", "Possibly slang for affixing?", "It's used mainly in the southern US and is not a typo.  Check this out - [https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/fixin-to](https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/fixin-to).", "I was living in Europe and my parents visited. I paid for them to have a week in Paris with one request; bring back a dozen croissants.  \nThey came back with the croissants and I was excited to have one with breakfast the next morning. Unfortunately for me, they had woken up early and ate them all. Two people ate a dozen croissants I had asked them to bring me.  \nTheir reason? \"We didn't have any of these while we were there and they're just so good!\"  \n\nYour inlaws sound exactly like them.", "For the sake of civility it would probably be better to have the conversation with them before the next time they gift you food, rather than just after they have used it.\n\nPersonally I would be inclined to let it go though. In the greater scale of things it is not worth falling out over mustard, maple syrup, or a few coffee beans.", "The inlaws aren't casual guests who need to ask about every little thing. They are family who come over all the time, babysit and feed the toddler.\n\nWould op prefer they wake him up and ask them if they can use the syrup to make breakfast for the kid? It's a misunderstanding that can be cleared up without snarky remarks.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be a falling out, though. OP can express their point of view and then it\u2019s on the in-laws.", "I think it\u2019s still pretty rude to use things like that without asking the person you gave the gift to. What if they were saving it for a special occasion, like a Christmas breakfast?", "Nah, that's not a given. If a family member came over and started using my thing without asking, I'd be irritated as hell. I agree that it can be cleared up with conversation, but blood and law don't erase a right to boundaries. If they don't know (and clearly they don't) they should be asking.", "Yeah, that one I don't get, maple syrup is pretty much maple syrup (I'm dark amber all the way though). OTOH, the itty bitty sample bottles of birch syrup from three different stages of sugar harvest sent all the way from Alaska? Totally different thing. Those were very much a tasting experience.", "This. If I buy a gift to share with someone, I say I bought this for us to enjoy together. I don\u2019t give someone a gift then months later decide well, that\u2019s a thing I\u2019m just going to use now.", "Nta", "I don\u2019t really mind sharing my food but doesn\u2019t it seem weird that his in laws visit every week? Maybe I need more context here but if it was me, I\u2019d feel smothered.", "NTA. This is rude. You don\u2019t give food gifts then eat them.", "Agree that the parents could very well have thought OP did not like or want a food gift that went unconsumed for *months*.", "This. These people are over every week, and have full reign of the kitchen?!! \n\nI mean, FIL likely wasn\u2019t eating the mustard with a spoon. He likely helped himself to their groceries too and had a sandwich or whatever. \n\nThat\u2019s weird to me. My MIL will come by and make herself a tea but anything else, she asks.", ">Inlaws may be assuming op doesn't really like the gifts so they are just trying to use them up. This is so easy to clear up without the rude comments when inlaws are feeding your kid breakfast.\n\nThen maybe it's the in-laws who should be communicating and asking OP rather than silently assuming they are required to volunteer their services as gourmet dustbins.", "Oh cool! But doesn't that usage need a verb after it, rather than objects? \"fixing them to you\" doesn't seem to follow the same pattern.", "It's not about how frequently you visit, or how closely related you are, it's about respect and manners.  I'm in my parents' house nearly every day but before I make myself a meal I check I'm not using something they're keeping for later.", "I think he meant \"fixing to give\". This usage isn't common in my region of the US but I have heard it. I had a friend from North Carolina who used \"fixing to\" when something was going to happen with some immediacy - \"I'm fixing to eat lunch\" as she sat down to lunch.", "yes, it is.  I acknowledge that.  It's completely fucked.  \n\nbut a deeper issue (to me) is why 4oz maple syrup is so precious when its so easily replacable?  OP has means to travel and bring them food gifts.  Hence my question.", "If they usually have Log Cabin or some other syrup that isn't actually maple syrup there is a HUGE difference. The other stuff is gluey sweetened corn syrup with flavor. It doesn't have the same texture at all.", "Thank you! I love learning new usages from different dialects.", "This is my experience. Never seen it moldy. Like honey.", "My pleasure! I love it too and it's nice to share.", "I live in Los Angeles, CA which is fairly arid (except for the last several weeks ;))and I\u2019ve had maple syrup grow mold. \n\nIf you Google, \u201cShould I refrigerate maple syrup.\u201d, every site states that if you don\u2019t, it can get moldy.", "In return, I offer you the UK's \"popping\" for brief/short journeys. I'm popping to the shops. I popped round to a friend's house. Charlotte popped round to say hi. It cracks my American friends up \ud83d\ude01", "I love this! Thank you!"]}
