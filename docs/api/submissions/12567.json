In the future, hide these treats when they\u2019re around.NTA", "INFO: Have you ever asked them not to partake of your gifts or placed the gifts somewhere where they wouldn't easily find them?  \n\nI think it's a bit presumptuous of them to tear in to their gifts, but at the same time if no one asked them not to and the gifts are in the same places as your normal, day-to-day foods, then you can't really blame them for helping themselves.  So, I suggest asking them nicely to let you savor the gifts at your own pace and/or putting the gifts somewhere where they're not easily accessible when your in-laws visit.", "They probably see it as something that they would be excited about and consume right away and don\u2019t understand you saving it for special occasions. You should separate your top shelf items from everything else so nothing else is used that you\u2019ve had like aged whiskey or wine. Just have the everyday things available for others to help themselves. While it sucks that they\u2019re using up your stuff without permission at least it was items that they paid for. I don\u2019t think anybody is necessarily an ah in this situation you guys just need to discuss it.", "NTA. Next time hide the gift they bring back.

If someone gave me an expensive bottle of wine I\u2019d feel like an asshole not offering them a glass \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fMaybe it would help you be less irritated to stop thinking of these items as gifts but rather as your in laws bringing back items to be shared as a family.", "It sounds like both you and your wife were raised differently. In my house, what your in-laws are doing would be considered normal and it wouldn't be an issue. It sounds like you came from a household with different expectations. Neither is bad or wrong, however, assuming that they know your expectations and how you view things without talking about it and than getting upset because they don't know is wrong. Yes, you could say it goes two ways but the situation isn't bothering them, so they don't know there is anything wrong.\n\nYou either need to talk to them or get over it. If you decide to talk to them, avoid anger and approach it from how much you live and appreciate their gifts and want to savor them.", "ESH. They shouldn't be indiscriminately eating these one-off precious foods, and in my view, they should also ask before eating stuff in your fridge in general. But you are also to blame for not taking steps to prevent this since it seems to happen often. Do you have a free-for-all on other things in the fridge? That policy would reasonably have them believe these items are also fair game. If you don't want them eating the perishable gifts they give you, store them away from general groceries at home. I keep my top-flight ingredients in a special place away from my partner and my roommates (when I had them).", "NAH\u2014 I don\u2019t think they are being AHs\u2014 they gave the gifts and expect you to also be generous. \n\nBut I have advice I\u2019ve seen from my foodie relatives: \nNerd out on them\u2014 \u201cthis is the Blah Blah you gave me\u2014 isn\u2019t it wonderful? It\u2019s got that earthy taste? Do you taste the minerals? That\u2019s what\u2019s most prized and what sets it apart from the cheap stuff\u2014 yes do you get whiffs of cherry? Yes? That\u2019s because blah blah.\u201d\n\nIt shows that you appreciate the gift and want them to appreciate it but also is kind of annoying if you don\u2019t actually care. \u201cMeh, I\u2019m fine with my Folgers\u201d might be what you get\u2014 win! Folgers comes with no lecture. \u201cOh\u2014 I see, that\u2019s why it costs so much!\u201d may make them use it more sparingly or continue to give you these appreciated gifts\u2014 win! \n\nBut I think you\u2019d be an AH if you voiced to them what I\u2019m hearing here \u201cI\u2019m the sophisticated one and I appreciate it so you don\u2019t deserve any, it\u2019s wasted on you!\u201d", "ESH. Their behavior is rude and presumptuous. It doesn\u2019t matter if they gave the gift or not, they shouldn\u2019t treat any of your possessions as their own.\n\nYou suck too but only a little bit. If they are regularly bringing gifts to you and doing this, just accept it for what it is. They aren\u2019t obligated to bring these gifts at all, so enjoy the parts you have and share, and you can simply anticipate this is how it\u2019s going to go. It\u2019s not as though their behavior is harmful even if it is peculiar.", "IDK I\u2019ve always shared food. Always.", "YTA. They don't owe you the gifts either.

NAH \n\nFood is communal and often differs from regular gifts. It isn't uncommon for gifted consumables to be opened right then and there to be shared around, if the time is appropriate. \n\nI understand wanting to savour special items, but that doesn't seem to be the way the inlaws think. No one is truly wrong, there just needs to be a discussion, firstly with OP's partner. Their parents, their decision on if it is okay for their parents to use gifted items. OP, if your partner doesn't see a problem as it is the standard in that family, then you'll just have to get use to it. As someone who has fork-st@bbed another person taking food from my plate, embrace sharing gifted food and you'll find the joy in it. Good food, good company.", "Yes, but a bottle of wine is different, particularly a special bottle. You open it and finish it (hopefully not alone). It doesn\u2019t sit in the refrigerator for weeks while you have half a glass at a time to stretch it out.", "Of course it doesn't bother them, they're using the things they bought for someone else without so much as asking.", "But it is wrong to use someone else's stuff without asking, especially when it is special/pricey/not much left.", "Well, looks like my in-laws just earned a new nickname: The Perishable Predators.", "WTF? How is OP at fault because they're not consuming the products as fast as humanly possible? This is a terrible judgment. Just because they brought the gifts doesn't give them the right to go 'oh well I guess OP isn't gonna use it, guess we will' on a regular basis. That's absolutely shitty of them.", "They don\u2019t owe him gifts, but they gifted him the items.

Just curious as neither syrup nor mustard require refrigeration in my experience.", "With the maple syrup, they were feeding the OP's own child. In that situation I don't think it's rude per se to use something from the cupboard. The only question for me is the size of the container. I'm neither American nor a maple syrup aficionado so I'm not sure how far a couple of ounces goes--if the bottles were single-serve or thereabouts then I'll lean towards team OP.", "You want to get technical on this, they have established different terms for the items they\u2019re giving. OP could decline the gifts, but it has been established that if OP accepts these gifts the terms are such that they are expected to be shared.", "Being stingy makes them TA. Utility wise it's a benefit being seen as a negative. It's petty and poor", "A good host would offer it. Maybe I'm in the minority. It's not that big of a deal.", "Both go bad more quickly if not refrigerated", "Op wasnt even there when they used some of these gifts. There wasn\u2019t even a chance to offer it.\n\nPlus thats when you first get a gift. Not when you had it and are savoring it."]}
