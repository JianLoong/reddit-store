Forcing someone to watch something they don't like is a mild form of punishment (severe if it's a hallmark movie). I mean, there is that window of 'giving it a chance' so if you noped out in 5 minutes, maybe the judgment would change. But if after 20-30 minutes of being bored you pulled out the phone, that's fair.", "NTA, you still sat with them. I don\u2019t understand why you had to watch a movie you didn\u2019t want to. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t like you were ignoring a conversation.", "On TV at home, and not in a movie theater, right?\n\nMostly NTA, although you'd be better off just getting up and leaving. You don't have to like the same things as the rest of your family.", "NTA - you were pressured into doing something you didn\u2019t want to do.", "NTA you will \u201cmiss\u201d the movie as surely as you would if you had fallen asleep. But that\u2019s just what we do these days; put on a movie and sit on our phones. Or fall asleep. Even for movies we want to see.", "Kinda yeah. I\u2019m sure the point was to spend time with your family. Yes, watching a movie together IS spending time with them.", "NTA, but this is at least partly a generational thing.", "No Asshole here / Everyone Sucks  \n\nHere's the thing, I completely understand both sides.  \n\nIt sucks if you want to share something with someone and they're just completely distracted and not paying attention.  \n\nHowever, being forced to sit down and watch a movie you're not at all interested in just for someone else's enjoyment is a chore.  \n\nI tried to introduce a GF to \"Firefly\" once and she was on her phone for most of episode 1, so we checked in with each other and realised it was better to just watch something else instead. No harm done, people are allowed to have different interests.", "INFO: were you at a house or a theater?\nAlso did you have your phone volume on or brightness up in an otherwise dark room?\n\nIf you were in a theater, had your phone sound on, or brightness all the way up 1000% yta.\n\nIf you were in a home, and phone was on silent, and brightness not enough to bother others enjoying the movie I don't see the issue. It sounds like they just really hoped you would enjoy it, and you didn't.", "YTA. They wanted you to come watch the movie *with* them, which is why they kept insisting you'd get into it, but you rudely ignored them anyway. If you didn't want to watch a movie, you should have said no or decided to leave when you couldn't get into the movie instead of making a big show about not watching it.", "Kind of but not really Yta. I mean yes it was a little rude you got out your phone but let's be real who's going to sit around for a solid hour and 40 minutes being bored as hell?", "YTA.", "YTA if you just can't get into the movie leave the room.", "ESH \nI understand not wanting to watch a movie you dont like.
