The key reason is people often don't pay you back right away and that's not okay. Most people can understand that one without arguing the point.

You are perfectly justified in ordering solo, and it's not like you're depriving anyone else of food.  They can still order for themselves, right?  There's no real harm done whatsoever. BUT, you violated social etiquette: they included you, and you excluded them in return. You probably hurt their feelings or made them feel like old farts that you can't be bothered coordinating with. Don't get me wrong - I would 100% want to order solo too and would probably try to find a way. It's just really tricky to do in an office situation without being an asshole. \n\nMaybe the best solution is just to keep on ordering solo and be the asshole for a while, until it becomes normalized and they eventually forget that you were ever the asshole.

I would send an email or post a note stating lunch order being placed at 11:30 am if you want in state your order and provide cash plus 15% (or whatever % you want to make it) prior to 11:30 am. It makes it cheaper on you to split tip and taxes. I would offer this maybe once a week or once a month only so people know I am thinking about them and other days I am free to do my own thing. Then I would tell people I don\u2019t always have time to coordinate orders but would love to on my usual day", "NTA\n\nOkay so after the first paragraph I was totally on the other side. Then I kept reading. Look, they are costing you money, you know it, they know it and dont care. Then trying to talk you into another place when they order for themselves all the time anyway? Jerks.\n\nThey can either put cash on the table including tip or suck it up. Though I will say that you doing that means you shouldnt join their orders anymore either. Not that they would be likely to ask you anyway after getting firm with them. I've worked places like this. I just always brought my own food or hunted for myself. It was cheaper and cut out all the drama.", "NTA you have tried before to do group orders, and it's always messy. People have straight up not paid you.

Why can\u2019t they order their own food from that restaurant if they want food from there? since you ordered from there are they not allowed to or something? If I saw someone come in with food from a place i liked I would just order some from myself. No big deal.\n\nand honestly I can\u2019t blame you for not wanting to order with them if they are not paying you back or helping tip.

Once we all decided to go to the movies together after work, eight or nine of us. I preordered the tickets the week before (it was opening day for a popular franchise).

And then I was branded as \u201cdifficult\u201d and not invited on the next outing. It pissed me off, but then again, someone else got to find out how it feels to not get paid back I guess. \n\nOP, just continue ordering for yourself, unless you want to keep floating deadbeats.

The food that he had already picked up. So she ended up trying to cancel the order, but Uber eats was making it really difficult, and we were incredibly busy at work that day. So Uber eats is communicating with the driver, like an hour has gone by and he agreed to deliver our food that had been in his possession for an hour. Uber eats still wouldn\u2019t refund, so the girl had to contact her credit card company. All the while, we\u2019ve already paid her. \n\nLol, it was a mess.", "This is the way.", "It started  as a way to skip delivery fees.
