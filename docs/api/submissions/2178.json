You prefer not to order with someone else, and your reasons are valid.\n\nEven if you didn't have justification, there's no reason to consider you an asshole. They can order their own.

Once bitten, twice shy.", "NTA If they complain about it just say you needed to order something last minute and didn't have time to check with them, but you'd be happy to show them where to get the app. Your job description does not include catering.", "NTA.

The key reason is people often don't pay you back right away and that's not okay. Most people can understand that one without arguing the point. Don't get pulled into engaging with anyone who wants to question you or has a solution to the problem (they think). Your reason should be enough. That said, don't be surprised if you're not included in future group orders.", "NTA, just be honest,  use your words.  \"Ladt time three people never payed me back\", \"I'm ordering in 5 minutes,  none up front if any one is interested \".  See how easy that is?", "NTA those services are expensive if they want that luxury too they gotta pay for it themselves.", "YTA. You are perfectly justified in ordering solo, and it's not like you're depriving anyone else of food.  They can still order for themselves, right?  There's no real harm done whatsoever. BUT, you violated social etiquette: they included you, and you excluded them in return. You probably hurt their feelings or made them feel like old farts that you can't be bothered coordinating with. Don't get me wrong - I would 100% want to order solo too and would probably try to find a way. It's just really tricky to do in an office situation without being an asshole. \n\nMaybe the best solution is just to keep on ordering solo and be the asshole for a while, until it becomes normalized and they eventually forget that you were ever the asshole. Or, organize a better group ordering system for the office.", "Yeah, this is sounds like a fun work place.", "That's probably why they're calling OP an asshole. They lost the opportunity to let someone else pick up the tab for their food.", "Early on in working there, we did that once. I wasn\u2019t ordering, but the restaurant did an awful job, many people didn\u2019t get their order, or it was just wrong. So everyone wanted their money back. I felt so bad for the girl that ordered. Really wasn\u2019t her fault, but she ended up out of pocket with the additional frustration of dealing with the restaurant . That happened once, and wasn\u2019t suggested again.", "NTA. You were doing them a favour before and they were taking advantage. Now they are cross that you are not letting them take advantage any more. Hold your ground, and serenely ignore them being crotchety. If they want to order, they can order themselves.", "This is a situation where you have to be totally straightforward, and not bend over backwards for anyone. You can say; \u201c hey guys! I\u2019m ordering from x, if anyone is interested please leave me your order and cash including gratuity and tax.\u201d And for those who don\u2019t have cash on hand, just tell them \u201csorry I don\u2019t have enough cash to cover.\u201d", "NTA no you were getting lunch, you're not obligated to feed other adults too, especially if they never pay you back. They can order their own ubereats.", "NTA. Regardless of how rude they are about shared deliveries, that's the entire point of the food delivery industry: anyone can order what they want, whenever they want.\n\nIf someone wants to tag on to your order, they should pay and add your item to theirs as last person in. If you've got non-payers, next time they're the ones who need to order and pay. \n\nBut if you prefer to order on your own, that's entirely reasonable - you're not inconveniencing anyone by doing so.", "NTA. I mean they don't even have to go out to pick up food from the same place. They just need to use the app just like you did.", "Why are you including a tip?", "If people have a go at you for not saying, just reply that last time you ended up paying for someone else's food and they refused to reimburse you, and you can't afford to do that again. Then ignore them. NTA", "NTA\n\nDoing an Ubereats or DoorDash order with housemates is nice but the whole office sounds like a nightmare.", "YTA for lumping them all together. If someone else normally does the ordering, then they are also possibly getting jipped with the tip or with people not paying. Try treating them as individual people instead of grouping them all as one.", "So yet another reason not to order for anyone else...\n\nNTA", "NTA. Just say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s nothing personal, but if I\u2019m paying so much to have food delivered, it\u2019s because I\u2019m having a crummy day and just need some time to destress. When we do group orders, it\u2019s a bit more chaotic than I need at the moment. But feel free to place an order amongst yourselves!\u201d", "NTA those complaining can just as easily order for themselves.  It\u2019s not like the restaurant will say, *\u201dsorry, you already ordered today\u201d*\n\nyou are not responsible for sorting other peoples food", "NTA   If Joe from work wants to eat something from door dash, Joe from work can order it on his own.", "Sometimes I offer and sometimes I don\u2019t but it should never be expected! NTA", "NTA. Do you even need to ask? If they don't pay well of course you should already know that they are the AHs.", "Also if they're not including tip when they reimburse OP I'd also kind of worry that they're the type of people who don't pay a tip to the driver on their own orders. Definitely not the type of customers I would want to lump myself in with.", "Yeah, individual orders are the way to go then. If they can't understand that the problem was the restaurant and still took it out in the girl there is no workable solution besides that.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.", "If someone came to me and said \u201cIf you order from such and such today lmk? I\u2019d like X and I\u2019ll CashApp you Y amount when you order, if that works for you\u201d I\u2019d say yes. \n\nOtherwise, keep ordering for yourself.", "NTA. Don\u2019t even engage. Say meaningless polite words and go on about your day. They can get their own exhausting lunches.", "NTA. However, to avoid conflict in the future, before placing the order, have them pay you through either Venmo or cash in hand. Give them a timeframe to pay and then order immediately after. Whomever hasn\u2019t paid can suffer through not having lunch delivered.", "NTA but creates workplace friction. I would send an email or post a note stating lunch order being placed at 11:30 am if you want in state your order and provide cash plus 15% (or whatever % you want to make it) prior to 11:30 am. It makes it cheaper on you to split tip and taxes. I would offer this maybe once a week or once a month only so people know I am thinking about them and other days I am free to do my own thing. Then I would tell people I don\u2019t always have time to coordinate orders but would love to on my usual day"]}
