That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. It was miserable for 13 years. When I was 13 it came out that my mom had been having an affair for around 4 years at that point. I heard her say that she did it to get away from this situation which I don\u2019t blame her for at all. Once the affair came to light my dad immediately filed for divorce. I was happy my mom got out of the situation, but the divorce made things hell for me for the next two years. My mom left with her AP and I was stuck in the house with my dad. He was even worse to me and really did a number on my self-esteem. After two years divorced my mom married her AP and I was able to move in with them full-time. I was never able to get along with my mom\u2019s husband while living with them though. He was nice and I tried to get along, but I couldn\u2019t help but see him as the person who broke up my parents marriage and made my life hell for those two years. I\u2019ve been to therapy but I have not been able to get over my feelings towards him and as a result only see him if I have to go over to my moms house for anything.\n\nTo the present day, I am getting married in 6 months to my fianc\u00e9 (F27). Our guests just got the invites and on them we specifically stated if the guest was allowed a plus one. I got a call recently from my mom who was upset because her original invite was only for her with no plus one. I did this because I knew she would want to bring her husband and I still have trauma associated with him and their affair and everything that resulted. I talked it over with my fianc\u00e9 and we decided that my mom would be allowed a plus one but it couldn\u2019t be her husband. When I told my mom this she freaked out. She told me that she can\u2019t believe I can\u2019t get over the divorce and all her husband did for both of us to help us out of that situation. I told her that while I appreciate all that her and him also left me for two years with my dad and that I associate him with that since he was the AP. She said she had to get out of that situation herself and get settled before she could come for me because my dad held all the power and money, but I told her that doesn\u2019t change that I was left in a bad situation myself as a result of her affair. She just screamed at me and hung up saying she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll come to the wedding anymore. I\u2019ve recently been getting texts from family members saying that I\u2019m being very cruel to mom and just need to let her bring her husband. My fianc\u00e9 is on my side but now I\u2019m torn.

Also by your own admission, you dad was abusive and horrible, why are you not upset with him? HE was the one who destroyed the marriage and your childhood.\n\nDivorces are nasty. You don't seem to believe her reasoning that she \"couldn't\" take you, but it's possible that's very true depending on her resources at the time. Also keep in mind that people in abusive relationships often have their self esteem battered into the ground -- it's so extremely possible that your abusive father had her convinced if she tried to take you he'd call the police, 'take you forever' etc. Absuers are manipulative and I think you need to go back to therapy and give your mother some grace.

Yes, he played a part in the dissolution of your parents' marriage, but that has nothing to do with you. It was your mother who was unfaithful to your father, it was your mother who left you with your father for two years... yet she's invited and the AP isn't. You're using this guy as a scapegoat and you're not addressing your unsolved issues with your mother. \n* Again I don't blame you for not wanting the guy at your wedding, but are you really surprised that your mother is upset her husband isn't invited? It's crass to invite one spouse and not the other to a wedding, and even more if they're related to the bride or groom. Also, \"she can have a plus one, but it cannot be her husband\"? That's just laughable and seems intentionally mockery. \n* Your mother also needs therapy. I'd dare say family therapy would also be great for you guys. She isn't remotely acknowledging her past mistakes and continues to throw excuse after excuse for her actions. I can understand being upset about the invite, but instead of trying to talk things through she's throwing a tantrum. Bad all around. \n\nI hope you guys can work it out and whatever happens you and your fiance\u00e9 have a lovely wedding.

Then to add insult to injury, you offer your mother the option to find another companion?  That's not okay.\n\nThen we get to your weird objections about your stepfather, someone you admit never did anything objectionable to you.

They could\u2019ve saved you, they chose not to. I\u2019m surprised you still have a relationship with your mom, it seems like both of them are equally at fault.", "This is a very sad situation. While I don't really understand why you villainize your mom's husband in particular while your father was the monster and your mother the one who abandoned you it is clear that there's a heartbreaking amount of trauma you carry. And emotional reactions to trauma aren't necessarily rational. \nI do feel kind of sorry for your mom's husband but you were put into an impossible situation as a child you clearly processed in the only way you could. Good on your for going to therapy! \nThat being said, your wedding is your day and it is absolutely within your right to choose not be faced with the apparent personification of your trauma - even if it's not his fault. Remind your mother that she abandoned you in your time of need. Her intentions don't matter, you are her child and her responsibility to protect and that this is one of the ways your trauma developed. This is not your fault. It's not your mom's husband's fault either.

People keep focusing on the \"he was nice\" comment but seem to be ignoring the \"I was never able to get along with him\" line. Really even though I understand your mom was in a tough spot in many ways, you don't leave your kid to be abused for 2 years, I'm sorry you don't. Even if she didn't have the resources to fight back legally for those 2 years, she should have at least done more to prevent you from suffering the abuse for those 2 years. However, she is your mother so I understand why you'd want her at the wedding. But I can also understand not wanting a reminder of the two years of abuse and trauma you suffered at what is supposed to be the best day of your life, even if he did help you and your mom out long term. Ultimately, he was the indirect catalyst to those two years, so excluding him makes sense to me. If your mom doesn't understand all this then that's on her.

With the external perspective I can't judge your mum for what she did, but I also don't blame you for being traumatised by it and the reality is, this stuff isn't logic based, it's emotional. Something I think people find very hard to reckon with is that something that messes a kid up messes them up regardless of the validity of the reasons behind it, and the validity of those reasons has no effect on the nature of the damage to the kid.

Many women stay in abusive situations because they can\u2019t find a way to get the kids out right away. The courts to NOT help a woman running from an abusive man. It can take years to prove the kids can be with her.\n\nA lot of them have to face the reality that they\u2019ll have to leave their kids in the horrible house temporarily, so they can get out and then send for their children. They take the risk for a better outcome in the long term, but it isn\u2019t an easy decision.\n\nYour mother may have been faced with this situation. Getting the kids may have been much harder than you think. Can you talk to her about it?", "You realize that I'd she'd taken you immediately and didn't have money for a killer lawyer and your dad would've demanded you back, you likely wouldn't have ever been able to leave your dad's until you were an adult. It sounds like your mom did the best she could to get both of you out of a horrible situation as soon as she could.", "I commented elsewhere, but wanted to add some perspective on this. My SIL divorced her husband when her children were still in diapers. She got a lawyer (no idea how she paid for it), he didn't because he couldn't afford it. She got most of what she wanted and wipes him out in child support. She plays a game for a year where she acts like they can get back together, changes her mind find a new man and takes Ex back to court again. This time Ex gets a lawyer to the tune of $20,000. He can't afford it, stops paying, laywer ditches him -- he loses again in court.\n\nIt all started in 2017 and now in 2022 those two are STILL constantly in court, dragging each other back with BS motions to amend visitation, child support, you name it. I wouldn't be surprised if they are in there 3-4 times every year. Occassionally ex has a lawyer, sometimes not. He always loses and apparently can't even afford rent for a place with his new wife/baby because of the costs. My SIL has fully admitted that she hopes to exhaust his money/emotions with the court and child support costs so she can convinced him to relinquish all rights and have her new husband adopt the kids. She's used his court and mental health records against him and is relentless in finding what she can to get her way.\n\nSo what I'm saying is (again) is that it's so very possible your mother had no choice but to keep you with your dad for legal reasons. If dad had the bankroll and she didn't, the right lawyer could have kept you away from her even longer. I have a friend who's dad did this. He didn't see his mom regularly for almost 7 years of his childhood because dad got nasty in court and mom didn't have the resources to match it. Friend always thought mom didn't want him and that was never the case, far from it.", "Why is that the affair partners fault and not your mother?\n\nShe is the one who has to protect you.

If this man has never treated you poorly, its possible your anger snd blame is misdirected.\n\nIt's your wedding and you are entitled to do what you want and invite who you want.

Money talks. A parent who can provide is the only thing a court is going to look at, especially as he would have been able to prove that she committed adultery in the relationship. And because he's an abuser the more she fought to have you, the more he would have fought to make her pay. YTA for blaming the wrong person.

Ex has recently been evicted from his home and had to move to a nearby county which SIL reports is very father-negative and it increases her chances of raking him over the coals. She's suspended some planned court activities until they can refile in new county and increase her chances.

This reminds me so hard of my high school friend whose mother escaped an abusive relationship and left all of her children with him for years.  My friend was the oldest, and not the abusive man's biological child, and so she took the brunt of all the abuse. When her mom finally got custody back (she could have had custody of my friend all along, honestly) the damage was so severe that the new step dad resented her for the mental health issues she had from the abuse, so the \"safe home\" wasn't safe either. \n\nI understand her mother was an abuse victim. She still sacrificed her oldest child to get herself out. \n\nLife is very messy, but you are holding a childhood victim of abuse to a higher standard than her adult parent, and that ain't right.", "NTA", "NTA but expect consequences, your mother probably won\u2019t go and you\u2019ll damage your relationship with her. Is it worth it?", "NTA, BUT I think you're blaming the wrong person. Your mother deserted you and left you with your horrible father. You were HER responsibility, not your mom's AP. If you aren't inviting her husband, you should not invite your mother.", "NAH.\n\nLook, abuse is awful. Your mom got out, which you should be happy about. I can absolutely understand your feelings of abandonment and that you also needed to get out. That said, it isn't always easy or even possible. Abusive parents often use their children as a weapon when the abused parent leaves. That means financial abuse (holding onto assets, refusing to pay child support), custody battles (often won by the abusive parent because the victim has been so traumatized and is generally not in a stable position to take custody), and additional threats. I can't be sure of what happened, but it's very possible that your mom could not take you until she got married, which gave her financial and housing stability to be able to legally take custody of you. Plus, as you yourself know, the effects of abuse take years to mitigate, and trying to parent a child during that time can sometimes end up just as bad for the child. Additionally, it could have ended up much worse - I myself was in an abusive relationship, and due to the abuser's control over money and his unethical BS with the courts, I lost my kids to him and couldn't even see my daughter for a couple years. It's caused a lot of heartbreak, and she is still dealing with the feelings of abandonment (even though it wasn't my decision or my fault, and she is now over 18 and living with me). Imagine if your mom challenged custody prematurely and you ended up stuck at your dad's for the rest of your minority because of it? It's very possible and happens all the time.  \n\n\nIt sounds like, from your writing, that once you went to your mom's home, you experienced a stable, loving life with her and her husband. You already know, intellectually, that it's not reasonable to take this out on her husband. He wasn't the cause of your abuse, and he wasn't the cause of the breakup of your family. Your dad was the cause of that. But your emotional associations have gotten the better of your reason, because that's what trauma does.\n\nI know you say you've been to therapy, which is great, but I'd like to suggest a couple other things. First is family therapy - first with you and your mom, and then once that dust settles add your stepdad in. It's not healthy to hold a grudge against someone for years when they haven't actually deserved it, and it probably affects you more than you know. Secondly, I suggest finding someone to provide DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) in addition to your other therapies. It's a specific approach to therapy that helps you essentially restructure the damaged brain connections you develop from trauma into new, healthier connections.\n\nUltimately, it's your wedding, and the guest list is up to you guys. But at the same time, your mom is understandably frustrated and hurt. This is something you can't just carry on with - it's on you both to fix it. It absolutely sucks that the victims are the ones that have to carry out the hard work of cleaning up the mess left by an abuser. But this work is important, and it will help you set a healthier tone for the rest of your life, including your life with your husband and (if you so choose) your children. I promise, it's worth it.", "NTA", "Ops mom ain't a victim here nta but I wouldnt invite her either", "YTA, definitely. You were happy your mom escaped the situation with your dad,but mad that she escaped it at the same time? Uh,ok. If your Mom's husband has always been nice to you,it's not his fault that he is associated with your trauma. Honestly,that's your problem,not his. You need to work that out in therapy. Sounds like this man had been much better to you than your real father.  And on another note,just so you know,it is very bad wedding etiquette and manners to pick and choose who you want to give a plus one to. Your mother and her husband are a married couple,they should be a package deal.  Then you tell your mom,ok,she can have a plus one,but it can't be her husband? That's ridiculous.", "YTA.

I decided to leave my ex about a month prior to that date, but was terrified to do so and didn't know how. I fell in love with him, and I genuinely tried to have a long-term/monogamous romantic relationship with him. However, he is still married to a woman who is making him effectively celibate. It is to the point that he were Roman Catholic, he could get an annulment. \n\nYou have to understand a few things about the situation that your mother was most likely in, and things that you may not have been able to understand as a child:\n\n* If there was financial abuse, your mother could not afford to leave your father and could not afford to fight for your custody. A fairly simple common law separation of assets battle is currently costing me $10,000 in legal fees. I left my ex over a year ago, and my financial situation is still not settled. \n* Most abusers are either narcissistic, psychopathic, sociopathic, or a combination of the above-mentioned. They are outstanding manipulators and are able to make their victim terrified to run away, making them feel worthless. Meeting my white knight gave me my confidence back, and allowed me to leave. It is possible that your mother's husband did the same for her, making her feel that she was a human being worthy of being loved. \n* It is possible that your mother tried to stay for an additional 4 years because she felt that you would be better off in this situation than if she left. It probably took her 4 years because she tried to make it work, until her situation became unbearable. This happens for most domestic violence victims with children - they try to make it work until the kids leave for college. \n\nYour mother's husband is probably her white knight in some capacity, and someone who is very important to her.

But that was not APs fault.", "The mom also left OP to fend for himself while she was busy having an affair for 4 years. But, hey, as long as *she* wasn\u2019t the punching bag\u2026", "But why is the guy\u2019s, and his alone, fault??", "It doesn\u2019t change the pain, and I 10000% would feel betrayed too, but on a financial level it isn\u2019t even just about having money to fight your dad in court - if she took you and he brought her to court for custody without viable financial ability to support you, she would likely have lost custody. It\u2019s so hard, because in many ways you were abandoned, even if the reasons why are what allowed you to escape your bio dad long term. It\u2019s complicated and my heart is with you.", " But OP should resent his mom for that, right?     What does the moms new husband have to do with anything?\n\nMaybe this is actually OPs way of punishing his mom.", "Not really assumed tbh. You're upset with your mum who abandoned you but keep in contact just because she's your mum. I wouldn't be utterly surprised if you kept in contact with your abusive dad just because he's your dad too", "Yeah it\u2019s true mom has a lot of responsibility there as well, yet we don\u2019t fully know what kind of situation they were in. He said his dad had all the money, perhaps mom couldn\u2019t sue for custody and had to build herself up (house, car, stable income) before being able to take her kid back. We don\u2019t know. \n\nMy point stands though, if anyone\u2019s an asshole here I bet it\u2019s not the step-dad. Unless he kidnapped the mom or forbid her from seeing her son. So much we don\u2019t know.", "Not necessarily and if you believe that you have way too much faith in the system, especially seeing as this was a decade ago.", "OP did. They literally blame the husband for tearing the family apart when the one who tore the family apart was the dad. They can be upset about the affair but after all these years still being upset at the husband and blaming them is just misdirected anger and resentment imo.", "That's hypothetical, I would say. I don't AP, I don't know if he's a winner or not. But he stayed with the mom.", "I agree with you if anyone should not be invited it should be mom.\n\nOut of the two AP is the less guilty party (not guilt free), but certainly less so.\n\nIf OP is really that upset about how things happened (understandably so) he should not have invited mom. \n\nBut in this instance OP is still mad about the situation but also wants his mom at the wedding (again understandably so) it is easier to take out his anger on AP instead of trying to actually deal with his anger at his mom.", "Not inviting the AP, as i just replied to someone else if anything the person that should not be getting an invite is OPs mom. Mom was the one who actually cheated not AP. AP made no vows to OP or the dad. \n\nMom was the one who left OP behind, AP couldn't have done anything. Mom is the only one that would have had legal authority. \n\nThe only people who broke up OPs family was the abusive dad and cheating mom.", "For a total of 6 years, mom left OP to the mercy of her abuser", "I don\u2019t know about anybody else but if my partner left their child in an abusive situation to be with me, I\u2019d feel a little responsible. And I\u2019d definitely be embarrassed if that same partner then tried to force a relationship with me on said child. But I guess that\u2019s just me!", "By staying with her and knowing she left her child with their abuser, he did stand by and let her do it. By staying with her after she abandoned her child, he was showing that letting a child be abused is perfectly acceptable. \n\nI\u2019m saying this as someone who was abused as a child. If you stand by and watch as a parent just leaves their child\u2019s abuser without trying to bring their kid with them when they leave, you are complicit in that child being abused. By standing by and watching OP\u2019s mother leave their abuser without her even trying to bring her kid with her, he was letting her leave her child to be abused.", "She could\u2019ve gotten a job with the time and energy she used to have an affair.", "Tsk! If only he think like you did...more rational than using his '2year miserable life' as a weapon to make his mother feel like a shit...hope after he getting married, he know and understand what 'married life' is...", "YUP. Dollars to donuts there were phone calls and other attempts at communication that mysteriously vanished before they got to OP.", "AP did have a roll to play in that though. If an AP is aware a person is married and continues to pursue them then both the married person and the AP are at fault. Mostly the married person. AP also left the child to continue to be abused for 2 years. To a child that experience will seem like \"stepdad rescued my mom but abandoned me\". They are entitled to that feeling.\n\nThis story is fake though and as an actual childhood abuse survivor, I'm big mad now. Their prior posts included a claim that they have a sister and that their mom got custody of them when they were 12", "OP isn't upset with the AP for the affair though. He's upset that the AP destroyed his parents' marriage and abandoned him with his dad. But the AP didn't do that. His parents' marriage was ruined by his abusive father long before the AP joined the picture. And he was abandoned by his mum not by the AP. If the AP came in and took OP away he'd be arrested for kidnapping. \n\nIt makes even less sense when he claims to be happy his mum had an affair and left him but hates the man she had an affair with and left him for.\n\nIt seems like OP resents his parents for his troubled childhood but has misplaced it on the AP because he still has some sort of dream family with his parents and blames the AP for that dream not coming true", "Agreed, but that's still not AH behavior. \nIf OP doesn't want AP at his wedding, that's fair, since they don't seem to have a close relationship.\nIf he still wants his mom to attend the wedding, that's fair, since it's his choice how much of a relationship he still wants. \n\nI don't think that he is accusing AP of anything, he is just stating that he personally has no interest in any deeper relationship (which is fine). And if he chose to forgive his mother or still tries to have a relationship, that's also fine. This is no AH behavior, he doesn't owe anyone an invite to the wedding.", "This. OP can't bear to turn his back on both his parents, it would be too hard and lonely. So he's unconsciously doing mental gymnastics to absolve his mom, and transferring all his anger on to mom's new husband instead.", "Perfectly said", "NTA. Agree 100%", "Mom messed up definitely\n\n but as other have pointed out it might not have been so clear cut. \n\nAbusive well of partners are able to use the system to their advantage. \n\nBeing with AP is what may have allowed mom to get the stability and monetary means to fight for OP in family court. \n\nMarriage, stability, and money is often a determining factor in awarding custody. \n\nNot all divorces are quick especially with contentious or abusive partners.", "You have every right to still want her there but there's a few truths you're just not paying attention to. Despite knowing her child was exposed to it she kept you in that situation for 13 years and when she found escape she did not even try to facilitate the same for you. Maybe she had herself convinced that you would be safe in his care if she wasn't there but if you weren't safe before there's no reason to think that.  \n\nShe chose to start an affair instead of planning an escape. She chose to leave without you. She accepted that she simply did not have the money to fight it without looking for resources. You have the right to choose whatever you want about your wedding but at least be honest with yourself about it", "I agree with you but I think harboring resentment for the AP for that much time given the circumstances is something that needs to be worked on and (if this were real I guess) excluding them is just being really over dramatic. I don\u2019t condone affairs but a lot of people leave unhappy marriages for better ones with people they met while married. It\u2019s shitty to happen that way but life is weird.", "In this case yes standard etiquette/behavior is if you invite one person you invite their spouse/partner. Not saying you need to give everyone a plus one and let them bring their new bf/gf of two weeks. \n\nBut yes if you invite your HS/college friend know they are married or have a long term partner of 2+ years and don't invite them that is AH behavior. That would hold true even if you never met them and were never going to have a \"deeper relationship\" with them.\n\nEdit: by them i mean the friends spouse/partner.", "Thi!!!", "Um, they absolutely were very prevalent 10 years ago. They became fairly common in the 80s or 90s.", "also, something a lot of people don't realize is that a lot of women's shelters have frankly absurd rules regarding male children. many of them refuse to house boys over a certain age (often around puberty) or just don't allow boys at all. that puts mothers with sons in a really tough spot.", "That last statement, wow. Unfortunately it may happen.", "This situation is tricky because I think there are so many conflicting emotions for OP because they have not properly and/or fully dealt with them in therapy. They have tried but not actually succeed. Not sure if they have not been honest with therapist or if they need a new therapist. \n\nI think OP does want mom there but at the same time I think you might have hit the nail on the head that OP is still mad and wants to punish mom. \n\nI don't think ultimatums/choices like this are good, and personally my reaction will almost always be to not choose or choose the person not giving me an ultimatum. Even if I would want to choose the other person.", "I actually think OP wants her to choose her husband. OP is upset with his mum for abandoning him but can't bear to go NC with her because at the end of the day she's still his mum. So he wants her to pick her husband again so that he can finally cut her off \"guilt free\"", "Pretty disrespectful to leave your child with an abuser for 2 years but that didn't stop the mum", "THIS!!!!!!!!", "ohh yeah the strong moral actions of having an affair and abandoning your child. the moms a real stand up women."]}
