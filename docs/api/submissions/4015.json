That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. It was miserable for 13 years. When I was 13 it came out that my mom had been having an affair for around 4 years at that point. I heard her say that she did it to get away from this situation which I don\u2019t blame her for at all. Once the affair came to light my dad immediately filed for divorce. I was happy my mom got out of the situation, but the divorce made things hell for me for the next two years. My mom left with her AP and I was stuck in the house with my dad. He was even worse to me and really did a number on my self-esteem. After two years divorced my mom married her AP and I was able to move in with them full-time. I was never able to get along with my mom\u2019s husband while living with them though. He was nice and I tried to get along, but I couldn\u2019t help but see him as the person who broke up my parents marriage and made my life hell for those two years. I\u2019ve been to therapy but I have not been able to get over my feelings towards him and as a result only see him if I have to go over to my moms house for anything.\n\nTo the present day, I am getting married in 6 months to my fianc\u00e9 (F27). Our guests just got the invites and on them we specifically stated if the guest was allowed a plus one. I got a call recently from my mom who was upset because her original invite was only for her with no plus one. I did this because I knew she would want to bring her husband and I still have trauma associated with him and their affair and everything that resulted. I talked it over with my fianc\u00e9 and we decided that my mom would be allowed a plus one but it couldn\u2019t be her husband. When I told my mom this she freaked out. She told me that she can\u2019t believe I can\u2019t get over the divorce and all her husband did for both of us to help us out of that situation. I told her that while I appreciate all that her and him also left me for two years with my dad and that I associate him with that since he was the AP. She said she had to get out of that situation herself and get settled before she could come for me because my dad held all the power and money, but I told her that doesn\u2019t change that I was left in a bad situation myself as a result of her affair. She just screamed at me and hung up saying she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll come to the wedding anymore. I\u2019ve recently been getting texts from family members saying that I\u2019m being very cruel to mom and just need to let her bring her husband. My fianc\u00e9 is on my side but now I\u2019m torn.

Inviting your mother with the instruction \"no husband\" is rude and disrespectful. By your own admission he has been nice to you and tried to help you out as you grew up. Also by your own admission, you dad was abusive and horrible, why are you not upset with him? HE was the one who destroyed the marriage and your childhood.\n\nDivorces are nasty. You don't seem to believe her reasoning that she \"couldn't\" take you, but it's possible that's very true depending on her resources at the time. Also keep in mind that people in abusive relationships often have their self esteem battered into the ground -- it's so extremely possible that your abusive father had her convinced if she tried to take you he'd call the police, 'take you forever' etc. Absuers are manipulative and I think you need to go back to therapy and give your mother some grace.

Yes, he played a part in the dissolution of your parents' marriage, but that has nothing to do with you. It was your mother who was unfaithful to your father, it was your mother who left you with your father for two years... yet she's invited and the AP isn't. You're using this guy as a scapegoat and you're not addressing your unsolved issues with your mother. \n* Again I don't blame you for not wanting the guy at your wedding, but are you really surprised that your mother is upset her husband isn't invited? It's crass to invite one spouse and not the other to a wedding, and even more if they're related to the bride or groom. Also, \"she can have a plus one, but it cannot be her husband\"? That's just laughable and seems intentionally mockery. \n* Your mother also needs therapy. I'd dare say family therapy would also be great for you guys. She isn't remotely acknowledging her past mistakes and continues to throw excuse after excuse for her actions. I can understand being upset about the invite, but instead of trying to talk things through she's throwing a tantrum. Bad all around. \n\nI hope you guys can work it out and whatever happens you and your fiance\u00e9 have a lovely wedding.

Having a kid with no money is no walk in the park. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t project the trauma your dad caused you onto other people. He could have been a great single dad but he chose not to.

Then to add insult to injury, you offer your mother the option to find another companion?  That's not okay.\n\nThen we get to your weird objections about your stepfather, someone you admit never did anything objectionable to you.

They could\u2019ve saved you, they chose not to. I\u2019m surprised you still have a relationship with your mom, it seems like both of them are equally at fault.", "This is a very sad situation. While I don't really understand why you villainize your mom's husband in particular while your father was the monster and your mother the one who abandoned you it is clear that there's a heartbreaking amount of trauma you carry. And emotional reactions to trauma aren't necessarily rational. \nI do feel kind of sorry for your mom's husband but you were put into an impossible situation as a child you clearly processed in the only way you could. Good on your for going to therapy! \nThat being said, your wedding is your day and it is absolutely within your right to choose not be faced with the apparent personification of your trauma - even if it's not his fault. Remind your mother that she abandoned you in your time of need. Her intentions don't matter, you are her child and her responsibility to protect and that this is one of the ways your trauma developed. This is not your fault. It's not your mom's husband's fault either.

People keep focusing on the \"he was nice\" comment but seem to be ignoring the \"I was never able to get along with him\" line. Really even though I understand your mom was in a tough spot in many ways, you don't leave your kid to be abused for 2 years, I'm sorry you don't. Even if she didn't have the resources to fight back legally for those 2 years, she should have at least done more to prevent you from suffering the abuse for those 2 years. However, she is your mother so I understand why you'd want her at the wedding. But I can also understand not wanting a reminder of the two years of abuse and trauma you suffered at what is supposed to be the best day of your life, even if he did help you and your mom out long term. Ultimately, he was the indirect catalyst to those two years, so excluding him makes sense to me. If your mom doesn't understand all this then that's on her.

With the external perspective I can't judge your mum for what she did, but I also don't blame you for being traumatised by it and the reality is, this stuff isn't logic based, it's emotional. Something I think people find very hard to reckon with is that something that messes a kid up messes them up regardless of the validity of the reasons behind it, and the validity of those reasons has no effect on the nature of the damage to the kid.

I belong to a group where there are quite a few women leaving their abusive exes. It\u2019s such a nightmare if there are kids. The fear that you\u2019ll lose them forever. Many women stay in abusive situations because they can\u2019t find a way to get the kids out right away. The courts to NOT help a woman running from an abusive man. It can take years to prove the kids can be with her.\n\nA lot of them have to face the reality that they\u2019ll have to leave their kids in the horrible house temporarily, so they can get out and then send for their children. They take the risk for a better outcome in the long term, but it isn\u2019t an easy decision.\n\nYour mother may have been faced with this situation. Getting the kids may have been much harder than you think. Can you talk to her about it?", "You realize that I'd she'd taken you immediately and didn't have money for a killer lawyer and your dad would've demanded you back, you likely wouldn't have ever been able to leave your dad's until you were an adult. It sounds like your mom did the best she could to get both of you out of a horrible situation as soon as she could.", "I commented elsewhere, but wanted to add some perspective on this. My SIL divorced her husband when her children were still in diapers. She got a lawyer (no idea how she paid for it), he didn't because he couldn't afford it. She got most of what she wanted and wipes him out in child support. She plays a game for a year where she acts like they can get back together, changes her mind find a new man and takes Ex back to court again. This time Ex gets a lawyer to the tune of $20,000. He can't afford it, stops paying, laywer ditches him -- he loses again in court.\n\nIt all started in 2017 and now in 2022 those two are STILL constantly in court, dragging each other back with BS motions to amend visitation, child support, you name it. I wouldn't be surprised if they are in there 3-4 times every year. Occassionally ex has a lawyer, sometimes not. He always loses and apparently can't even afford rent for a place with his new wife/baby because of the costs. My SIL has fully admitted that she hopes to exhaust his money/emotions with the court and child support costs so she can convinced him to relinquish all rights and have her new husband adopt the kids. She's used his court and mental health records against him and is relentless in finding what she can to get her way.\n\nSo what I'm saying is (again) is that it's so very possible your mother had no choice but to keep you with your dad for legal reasons. If dad had the bankroll and she didn't, the right lawyer could have kept you away from her even longer. I have a friend who's dad did this. He didn't see his mom regularly for almost 7 years of his childhood because dad got nasty in court and mom didn't have the resources to match it. Friend always thought mom didn't want him and that was never the case, far from it.", "Why is that the affair partners fault and not your mother?\n\nShe is the one who has to protect you.

I can't imagine how difficult it is to have a constant reminder of those terrible years.\n\nThat being said, I really think you should reconsider. Maybe seek out some professional help? I'm worried these actions will have long standing consequences that you may regret down the road. If this man has never treated you poorly, its possible your anger snd blame is misdirected.\n\nIt's your wedding and you are entitled to do what you want and invite who you want.

Money talks. A parent who can provide is the only thing a court is going to look at, especially as he would have been able to prove that she committed adultery in the relationship. And because he's an abuser the more she fought to have you, the more he would have fought to make her pay. YTA for blaming the wrong person.

Granted, this was all years ago, but I think as a mother she should still feel some guilt over leaving her son behind for two years. \n\nI won't judge her further for that without knowing the specifics (is it true that she had no money at all, was it a situation of financial abuse? I don't know), but regardless of her motivation or if she had other options at the time or not, she has to know that her decision traumatized her son. How could she not know? \n\nNow OP makes her husband the scapegoat of his trauma-linked resentment, and instead of addressing her own wrongdoings and try to talk things through, she freaks out, defends herself, shouts at him and ultimately says she won't come to the wedding. \n\nShe isn't a victim (not of OP, at least) and she isn't helping the situation at all. She's only making it worse, because it's likely in the future OP will also blame the AP for his mother missing his wedding.", "What people see is that the OP has chosen to carry this baggage with him for over a decade.

For the last 6 years all of this has been with their original county court. Apparently it's very \"father\" friendly and does what it can to keep families together, which is why SIL does not have sole custody yet. Ex has recently been evicted from his home and had to move to a nearby county which SIL reports is very father-negative and it increases her chances of raking him over the coals. She's suspended some planned court activities until they can refile in new county and increase her chances.
