It was a lot of work to care for an aging dog who showed no real affection towards me, but I still loved him and did it happily. We have another dog thats 10 now and we got her together, shes always been \u201cmy dog,\u201d even though we got her together. \n\nWith two small kids, another dog, my own career, I\u2019m just sort of enjoying not having yet another creature to care for. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, my husband signed up on the waiting list for a puppy from the breeders where our in-laws got their dog last year. He found out today that he has a dog available for him to purchase at the end of august. It was always our plan to discuss and decide on our next dog in august, not get one in august. He tells me two days ago and says I have to say yes or no by today. I am neck deep in work stuff this week and leaving for a 5 night work trip, and he sprung this on me. \n\nI am not interested in this particular puppy, its not a specific breed, or an older rescue that we can predict how it\u2019ll be with small kids.

I don\u2019t like that he only gave me 48hrs when he knew about this for a month. He wants this specific dog too bc its the same parents and thus the sibling to his dad\u2019s dog and the last litter that will be bred with these two dogs. \n\nMy husband can be dramatic to get his way, but he has never stayed at a hotel to manipulate a situation.

Doesn\u2019t seem like your husband put a lot of thought into planning for this puppy.", "NTA and let hubby continue to stay at the hotel until he comes to his senses.

Spur of the moment pet acquisition often ends poorly.\n\nYou two need to sit down together and talk about what you want in a dog (size, personality characteristics, puppy or adult, whether breed is important and if so which you want, etc).  It seems like neither of you had a clear idea about what the other wants and why.  I\u2019m not sure he was on the same page as you about how the whole dog decision timeline was supposed to go, which suggests some communication failure there, unclear who was at fault for that.", "NTA.

Does he do stuff like this often?", "NTA. \n\nYeah, don\u2019t cave in to that level of theatrical nonsense. If anything stomping off in a tizz to stay in a hotel would solidify my resolve and Id never agree to this dog.", "NTA. Your husband sounds very manipulative, you should talk to him about it.

He went behind your back to sign up for the puppy, deliberately withheld this information until the last second to put extra pressure on you to agree, then stormed off to a hotel to put even more pressure on you to agree.

A reasonable partner asks politely, lets you make a choice freely, takes your concerns seriously, and works out a compromise that is acceptable to both of you. \n\nWhen your husband returns, you need to tell him that this is not sustainable and you two need to be in counseling to figure out a more healthy and respectful way to have disagreements. Ask him if he would ever want a spouse or partner to treat one of his children the way he is modeling treatment of you. I know that this community always jumps to divorce, but I genuinely think that divorce should be on the table if he doesn't want to do counseling. Think about doing this shit with him for another 40 to 50 years. Think about 50 years of him manipulating situations so you *have* to cave to what he wants or you're the bad guy. 50 years of him offloading the work of parenting and pet care so he can have a happy family home while you also try to keep up with your career.

OP I know there are hundreds of comments here, but I hope you read this one.\n\nWhen we lose a pet, it can mean a lot more to us than simply losing a friend and companion. Sometimes the death of a pet can symbolize something else, for example the end of an era. He had the dog for 14 years, so the death of that dog could easily signify the end of an era for him (for example, if he got the dog as a kid, he is feeling the loss of childhood). When we lose a pet, it can also bring back the grief of losing someone else we held dear. Losing a pet is complicated and messy, and it hasn't been that long since your pet passed away, so he is probably still processing that grief.\n\nThe new dog was likely a coping mechanism for this grief, especially since he probably signed up on the waiting list months ago. A lot of people try to replace their old pet with a new pet to try and move on. He has probably been focusing on getting this puppy for months and used that as his sole coping mechanism. You mention that the dog he wants is from the same breeder as his dad's dog: that's a clue that his feelings about this puppy are likely tied up with his feelings about his parents.\n\nSince he can't have the puppy, the loss of losing his dog came back full swing. He probably doesn't even understand why he feels this way, so he might be lashing out at you. Or maybe he feels that you are minimizing his grief by not letting him have the puppy.\n\nI went with NAH because I think that both of your feelings are valid in this situation, even though I think your husband went about it in the wrong way. He did spring it on you, and it does seem like the dog is not the best fit for your family right now. However, as someone who works with pets and their owners, I'm not at all suprised it went down this way, and in fact this is a pretty common story.

You have an emotional connection to this because your family has dogs from the breeder but I don\u2019t have any time to train a puppy. Do you? This is not the time to get a new puppy.\u201d Good luck with your little boy, I mean husband.", "I mean I kind of understand where your husbands thought process is. I completely disagree with the way he has gone about it though.

Therefore, that shouldn\u2019t be a factor, go ahead and mourn/end it now, and instead if you NEED another dog within the next two years, you should discuss maybe getting an older dog which is less of a time commitment (since you feel like you are just catching air).", "NTA. But does your husband normally wave so many red flags??", "NTA. A decision this big is one of those times where both sides have a veto.

And he deals with all these mess that happens with puppies. \n\nIt means he is responsible for ensuring the puppy gets fed, taken to vet as needed, spends time training the pup, etc. \n\nI suspect he has either clearly forgotten how much work an actual puppy is or he has never done the actual work associated with one. \n\nI have had dogs for the past almost 50 years.  I love puppies but at this moment in time I do not want to start with a baby puppy so when the time comes will find a pup 6 months or older.  At 4 months most puppies have bladder retention, they are usually able to pay more attention and by 6 months might be down to eating 2 meals a day rather than 3.  Also I prefer not to be woke up by the smell of said puppy having pooped in its pen and having to clean the puppy, the pen, etc. at 1am. \n\nSo when your husband gets himself back home and you return from your business trip I wish you the best in having an adult conversation with him.", "NTA.

And if he was really doing 70 to 80% of the care for it, then a massive part of his life has gone and he's probably struggling to cope. \nHow he has gone about it is extremely immature but for me having my dog sit on the sofa with me every night and taking him on walks and stuff is a massive mental health coping mechanism. \nI could see it being really hard with him seeing you still having \"your\" dog and having all of these things but him not having them anymore. \n\nThe situations a hard one and I don't believe anyone here is an asshole, however he's not dealing with it in a mature way considering the young family.\n\nThat all said, going to a hotel is a straight up adult tantrum and not something that should be accepted in this situation considering the fact that he has a whole family to care for, very toxic.\nHe also sprung the request in you in an extremely unreasonable way", "NTA.

It\u2019s one thing to leave a partner over something like this (still extremely bad btw) but to ditch her with two kids left behind, is next level as it not only fractures the relationship but what\u2019s it doing to his kids?

You seem like a pretty reasonable person who really does care about what is best for the puppy, and from what I know about them most dalmatians are just not good family dogs. They are extremely high energy with very high exercise needs, and they are working dogs who NEED a job or else they turn into stressed out, anxious wrecks who destroy things, are generally obnoxious, and may bite people. They are very strong willed, and usually need an experienced and committed handler to successfully train and then keep training because they will periodically test to see if you still really mean it. They will not accept successful training from their primary handler to mean that they must also obey other people (most dogs won't, honestly). They are often very reserved and only get really attached to one or two people, and are generally uninterested in anyone else. They also tend to not be really cuddly or high touch dogs.
