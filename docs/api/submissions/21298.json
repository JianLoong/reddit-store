I say husband\u2019s dog bc he pre-dated me and although I was the one who took care of him 70% of the time due to my husband\u2019s work travel, the dog was never fond of me. It was a lot of work to care for an aging dog who showed no real affection towards me, but I still loved him and did it happily. We have another dog thats 10 now and we got her together, shes always been \u201cmy dog,\u201d even though we got her together. \n\nWith two small kids, another dog, my own career, I\u2019m just sort of enjoying not having yet another creature to care for. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, my husband signed up on the waiting list for a puppy from the breeders where our in-laws got their dog last year. He found out today that he has a dog available for him to purchase at the end of august. It was always our plan to discuss and decide on our next dog in august, not get one in august. He tells me two days ago and says I have to say yes or no by today. I am neck deep in work stuff this week and leaving for a 5 night work trip, and he sprung this on me. \n\nI am not interested in this particular puppy, its not a specific breed, or an older rescue that we can predict how it\u2019ll be with small kids. I\u2019m personally not ready for another dog and its going to be a big dog. I thought saying no would be understood, but he got really emotional and stayed at a hotel last night. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m being selfish in saying no to this dog, its not no forever, just a no until we can decide on the right dog together. I don\u2019t like that he only gave me 48hrs when he knew about this for a month. He wants this specific dog too bc its the same parents and thus the sibling to his dad\u2019s dog and the last litter that will be bred with these two dogs. \n\nMy husband can be dramatic to get his way, but he has never stayed at a hotel to manipulate a situation.

Who cares that he really, really wants a dog? It doesn\u2019t even sound like he\u2019s around enough to enjoy it.

It\u2019s not the right time for a new puppy. Y\u2019all have bigger issues. His reaction was not even remotely close to appropriate.\n\nThe real question is what are you going to do if/when he goes ahead & gets this puppy? That\u2019s the conversation you need to have.\n\neta \u2014 is anyone concerned about the kids & your 10 year old dog? Doesn\u2019t seem like your husband put a lot of thought into planning for this puppy.", "NTA and let hubby continue to stay at the hotel until he comes to his senses. A dog is a big commitment and both parents need to agree. He tried to manipulate you by springing it on you hoping you'd just agree. Stand firm in your 'no'!", "NTA. Getting a dog is not a \"fun spontaneous purchase\". It's a commitment. If you are not ready and the dog doesn't match you lifestyle, then it's 100% wrong to adopt him.\n\nYour husband needs to understand that a dog must be an unanimous decision. He should have communicated with you better, it's on him.", "NTA.  You\u2019ve got a lot of stuff going on right now.  There will always be more dogs around to adopt.\n\nWho does he think is going to raise and train this puppy?  Have you ever had a serious discussion about how much care you had to take of his last dog?  Is he planning to help with the dirty work like housebreaking, or is he just going to cuddle the puppy and leave you to do all the work?", "NTA.  And if he gets the dog anyway make him board it when not home.\n\nHonestly it\u2019s ridiculous.  He\u2019s going to make you take care of a dog you didn\u2019t agree to.  That\u2019s terrible.  He\u2019s being a child.", "NTA. There is no reason to rush this and you should decide together when both of you are ready. Going behind your back and making you decide suddenly and very quickly sounds a bit manipulative.", "NTA.  Giving you such short notice to decide feels pretty manipulative to me.  He should\u2019ve told you as soon as this opportunity presented itself so you had time to think about it and discuss it together.  Spur of the moment pet acquisition often ends poorly.\n\nYou two need to sit down together and talk about what you want in a dog (size, personality characteristics, puppy or adult, whether breed is important and if so which you want, etc).  It seems like neither of you had a clear idea about what the other wants and why.  I\u2019m not sure he was on the same page as you about how the whole dog decision timeline was supposed to go, which suggests some communication failure there, unclear who was at fault for that.", "NTA.

They are a TON of work and if your husband isn't going to help you then I don't blame you for not wanting a puppy! \n \nNTA, put your foot down.

He's angry that you won't add raising a puppy to your load, which is already his 50% to supervising and raising his kids, and his 50% plus the kids responsibility for maintaining his home and household.", "A breeder with a wait list... that doesn't have a specific breed?\n\nYTA for even considering buying a puppy from there it's almost certainly a puppy farm", "NTA, a pet is a two yes one no kind of decision (even more yes votes necessary for larger families), your vote being the most important one if you will be doing the majority of the looking after the dog. That aside, your husband staying at a hotel to manipulate you emotionally is a huge red flag. So is the \"My husband can be dramatic to get his way\". I think you might have more problems than the dog thing. I would tell him if he leaves like that one more time, he should not bother coming back.", "NTA as you already stated hes being manipulative. He only told you with so little time left in the hopes you wouldn't say no instantly and now he's upset his deception didn't work. Does he do stuff like this often?", "NTA. \n\nYeah, don\u2019t cave in to that level of theatrical nonsense. If anything stomping off in a tizz to stay in a hotel would solidify my resolve and Id never agree to this dog.", "NTA. Your husband sounds very manipulative, you should talk to him about it. It is not normal behaviour to go stay at a hotel if he doesn't get to have the puppy he wanted on a 48 hours notice. Even if he is emotional, he made a decision to go behind your back signing up for the waiting list", "He\u2019s having a temper tantrum over a puppy. NTA. I understand he lost his dog recently, but it\u2019s not an excuse to go behind your back like this.", "NTA. Your husband is throwing a tantrum about a puppy he's largely not gonna be around to take care of that he made a unilateral decision to get thinking you'd cave bc he sprung it on you. NTA bu have way bigger problems than this dog.", "NTA\n\nAnd you need to talk to him, this is not great behaviour. A puppy is a lot of work and it doesn't sound like your family can handle it rn, which is ok, just means you have to wait for a more appropriate time.\n\nI'm pretty emotional too.

This isn't an adult way to deal with conflict and I would not capitulate to it. He needs to grow up and act like an adult. NTA", "NTA\nSo your husband is emotionally manipulating you and that's a MASSIVE issue thst needs to be sorted. My partners family all recently got dogs and his two nephews have asked when we are getting one. I saod when I decide if it's ok to get one because I will be the one feeding, grooming, training, picking up after, medicating/ bringing to the vet etc. My partners face fell but he knew I was right.

It\u2019s super disrespectful of you. This isn\u2019t about a puppy this is about whether you\u2019re a servant or a partner in my opinion, sorry for the stark terms.", "NTA Just say no.

He went behind your back to sign up for the puppy, deliberately withheld this information until the last second to put extra pressure on you to agree, then stormed off to a hotel to put even more pressure on you to agree. A reasonable partner does not intentionally apply pressure to force an agreement. A reasonable partner asks politely, lets you make a choice freely, takes your concerns seriously, and works out a compromise that is acceptable to both of you. \n\nWhen your husband returns, you need to tell him that this is not sustainable and you two need to be in counseling to figure out a more healthy and respectful way to have disagreements. Ask him if he would ever want a spouse or partner to treat one of his children the way he is modeling treatment of you. I know that this community always jumps to divorce, but I genuinely think that divorce should be on the table if he doesn't want to do counseling. Think about doing this shit with him for another 40 to 50 years. Think about 50 years of him manipulating situations so you *have* to cave to what he wants or you're the bad guy. 50 years of him offloading the work of parenting and pet care so he can have a happy family home while you also try to keep up with your career.
