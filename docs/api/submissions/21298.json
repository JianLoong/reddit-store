I say husband\u2019s dog bc he pre-dated me and although I was the one who took care of him 70% of the time due to my husband\u2019s work travel, the dog was never fond of me. It was a lot of work to care for an aging dog who showed no real affection towards me, but I still loved him and did it happily. We have another dog thats 10 now and we got her together, shes always been \u201cmy dog,\u201d even though we got her together. \n\nWith two small kids, another dog, my own career, I\u2019m just sort of enjoying not having yet another creature to care for. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, my husband signed up on the waiting list for a puppy from the breeders where our in-laws got their dog last year. He found out today that he has a dog available for him to purchase at the end of august. It was always our plan to discuss and decide on our next dog in august, not get one in august. He tells me two days ago and says I have to say yes or no by today. I am neck deep in work stuff this week and leaving for a 5 night work trip, and he sprung this on me. \n\nI am not interested in this particular puppy, its not a specific breed, or an older rescue that we can predict how it\u2019ll be with small kids. I\u2019m personally not ready for another dog and its going to be a big dog. I thought saying no would be understood, but he got really emotional and stayed at a hotel last night. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m being selfish in saying no to this dog, its not no forever, just a no until we can decide on the right dog together. I don\u2019t like that he only gave me 48hrs when he knew about this for a month. He wants this specific dog too bc its the same parents and thus the sibling to his dad\u2019s dog and the last litter that will be bred with these two dogs. \n\nMy husband can be dramatic to get his way, but he has never stayed at a hotel to manipulate a situation.

It seems like neither of you had a clear idea about what the other wants and why.  I\u2019m not sure he was on the same page as you about how the whole dog decision timeline was supposed to go, which suggests some communication failure there, unclear who was at fault for that.", "NTA.

If anything stomping off in a tizz to stay in a hotel would solidify my resolve and Id never agree to this dog.", "NTA. Your husband sounds very manipulative, you should talk to him about it.

He went behind your back to sign up for the puppy, deliberately withheld this information until the last second to put extra pressure on you to agree, then stormed off to a hotel to put even more pressure on you to agree.

A reasonable partner asks politely, lets you make a choice freely, takes your concerns seriously, and works out a compromise that is acceptable to both of you. \n\nWhen your husband returns, you need to tell him that this is not sustainable and you two need to be in counseling to figure out a more healthy and respectful way to have disagreements. Ask him if he would ever want a spouse or partner to treat one of his children the way he is modeling treatment of you. I know that this community always jumps to divorce, but I genuinely think that divorce should be on the table if he doesn't want to do counseling. Think about doing this shit with him for another 40 to 50 years. Think about 50 years of him manipulating situations so you *have* to cave to what he wants or you're the bad guy. 50 years of him offloading the work of parenting and pet care so he can have a happy family home while you also try to keep up with your career.

It's not fair to an older dog to get pushed around by a young puppy if that's likely to happen. Two years ago we had two older dogs. One developed skin cancer and was gone very quickly. Our other dog was bereft. For example, he spent months sleeping in the spot where our other dog's bed had been.  He always liked other dogs, including puppies and smaller dogs, so we decided to get a puppy. And it's been hard, our puppy is now 20 months old. I don't work and am home most of the time and it's difficult, I can't imagine how hard it would be for someone working with a spouse that travels a lot. And my puppy has been an incredibly good girl who didn't nip, didn't chew everything in sight (chewed some things, but not like most puppies) and is super smart and learned so much from our other dog.  OP should not get a puppy unless she is *totally* down for it.  BTW, our dogs do get along quite well, but they fight like siblings sometimes and the young one does try to use her size, etc, to push the older one around (but he doesn't allow it.)

He already knows she's serious; that's why his response was so extreme rather than one of trying to wear her down or even getting the dog and hoping that forgiveness would be easier than permission.  He didn't, so he knows she's serious, and throwing the divorce grenade into the mix is unnecessary... and really dumb.
