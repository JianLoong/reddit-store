No reasonable person can expect to kick someone out of their house and expect them  to keep the utilities in their name. You are entitled to your money back. We pay for the deposits on our new place with the refunds from our previous place. This is the way life works.", "Assuming you gave him a couple weeks lead time to switch them over, NTA.

You don't owe your dad shit. As a parent he had to take care of you before you were of age. He wasn't 'doing you a favor' by raising you and giving you a roof to live under.
