Your niece can donate the ones she doesn\u2019t want to keep when she\u2019s finished with them. That should help reduce the clutter in your sister\u2019s house.\n\nYour sister probably has a lot of stress right now. She has to become a parent again, and the number of books has caused a dilemma. It would probably be a nonissue to other people, but I was just reading how difficult it is to transition to life outside prison. The number of books may be a tangible sign of all she\u2019s missed in the last five years, and that has to be upsetting. It may be easier to lash out at you than blame herself. However, you did nothing wrong. In fact, you are a wonderful uncle. \n\nPS This may be a difficult time for you, too, and I wish you the best.", "As someone who has bookshelves in every room of my house, NTA.  That being said, in a small house or apartment books do take up a lot of space so have you thought of giving your niece a kindle?  I have kindle app on my tablet and have been slowly been replacing some of my favorites to ebooks because seriously, my floors are sagging under the weight of my books.", "NTA but your sister has a point there, it's not easy for her to live up to the expectations her kid has because of you being a great uncle while she wasn't even there. As that's not your fault and what you did benefits the kid, there isn't anything to argue about from outside perspective, but perhaps you care to talk to your sister, show some understanding for her tricky situation and make it clear that you only have the kid's and her well being on your mind and are open to help her find some ways to better her relationship with the now young woman who is estranged for obvious reasons.", "NTA. If your niece no longer reads some of the books, because 200 is a lot, you can donate the unused ones.", "NTA. I would dare say it's about more than the books though.", "NAH but your sister isn't mad about the books.

Every child deserves to have a library of 200 books. \n\nIt would be a kind coda to your years of caring for your niece if you dropped by where they are living and helped them figure out where your niece can keep her library, since her mom's right, it's not really a workable solution to have her daughter dropping by to pick up books from your place.", "NTA for buying her books, but how fast does she read?\n\n\nIt's completely reasonable for your sister to not want 200 books to come with her daughter.

Besides your solution of storing some of the books overflow, can you and your niece go through the books and see if theres any she's outgrown that can be donated to the local library? You might even be able to expand on your tradition, and have her go to that library once a week to pick out a new book.
