Could she get any more petty or peevish?  (Maybe, but it's hard to think of how.)\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhat's so difficult about bringing your child to see the uncle that helped raise her every once in a while. Sounds to me like she's more irritated that you bought her kid gifts more often than she's gonna be able to.", "NTA it sounds like your sister is just looking for an excuse to argue with you.", "NTA. Reading has a variety of benefits, including reducing stress. Having a mother in prison was undoubtedly stressful for your niece. You offered a solution to the problem of having too many books (as if there is such a thing!)\u2014keep them at your house. Your niece can donate the ones she doesn\u2019t want to keep when she\u2019s finished with them. That should help reduce the clutter in your sister\u2019s house.\n\nYour sister probably has a lot of stress right now. She has to become a parent again, and the number of books has caused a dilemma. It would probably be a nonissue to other people, but I was just reading how difficult it is to transition to life outside prison. The number of books may be a tangible sign of all she\u2019s missed in the last five years, and that has to be upsetting. It may be easier to lash out at you than blame herself. However, you did nothing wrong. In fact, you are a wonderful uncle. \n\nPS This may be a difficult time for you, too, and I wish you the best.", "As someone who has bookshelves in every room of my house, NTA.  That being said, in a small house or apartment books do take up a lot of space so have you thought of giving your niece a kindle?  I have kindle app on my tablet and have been slowly been replacing some of my favorites to ebooks because seriously, my floors are sagging under the weight of my books.", "NTA but your sister has a point there, it's not easy for her to live up to the expectations her kid has because of you being a great uncle while she wasn't even there. As that's not your fault and what you did benefits the kid, there isn't anything to argue about from outside perspective, but perhaps you care to talk to your sister, show some understanding for her tricky situation and make it clear that you only have the kid's and her well being on your mind and are open to help her find some ways to better her relationship with the now young woman who is estranged for obvious reasons.", "NTA. If your niece no longer reads some of the books, because 200 is a lot, you can donate the unused ones.", "NTA. I would dare say it's about more than the books though.", "NAH but your sister isn't mad about the books. She's envious of all the time you spent with her daughter that she didn't and the books are an easier thing to bring up with you. Maybe help her to get her own thing with her daughter.\n\nEdit - changed from NTA to NAH", "NTA - You\u2019re looking out for your niece and encouraging her to read, which is one of the major indicators of success. You can always think about e-books as a compromise if there\u2019s not enough space at her place!", "NOT TA! Every kiddo needs books to learn and read! If she doesn\u2019t want them she can always donate to a consignment shop or a local thrift store for the books her daughter isn\u2019t reading anymore or is too old for if she doesn\u2019t want to leave some with you! It\u2019s so harmless to give a kid a book I don\u2019t understand the big deal. Just IMO.", "NTA.  Your sister getting irritate with you \"or not having foreseen this issue\" is simply ridiculous.  Her complaints are really about something else.  I think that your sister is feeling guilty for having been absent from her daughter's life and is taking it out on you.  \n\nOne way of saving room is if you and your niece donate some/most of the books to a library so that others can enjoy them.", "NTA\n\nWhat an ungrateful jerk yer sis is, tho.", "NAH. It's not about the books. It was never about the books.  It's not even about you or your niece.  Your sister is in for a hard time for the next few weeks/months.  Your niece will need you for a while.", "NTA at all. A book every week??? Can I be your niece?  That is awesome.", "You are *never* the asshole for buying a child books. NTA times a million.", "Definitely NTA your sister is jealous of the impact you had on her daughter and how much influence you have had on her life and love for books, she can see that the impact you made is probably going to be more than she would ever have and the nieces childhood memories will probably be with you", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds to me like your sister feels threatened by you fot essentially being the mother for her daughter for 5 years and lashed out. Prepare for more drama.\nHas your niece also read all of these books? :)", "NTA. Every child deserves to have a library of 200 books. \n\nIt would be a kind coda to your years of caring for your niece if you dropped by where they are living and helped them figure out where your niece can keep her library, since her mom's right, it's not really a workable solution to have her daughter dropping by to pick up books from your place.", "NTA for buying her books, but how fast does she read?\n\n\nIt's completely reasonable for your sister to not want 200 books to come with her daughter. You're only an hour away (I assume that doesn't mean an hour flight). Your neice can grab 5 books at a time and switch them out. \n\n\n\nAre you saying that if she doesn't take all of them immediately you get rid of them?", "NTA \n\nYour sister should be grateful her daughter had a safe, caring, loving, nurturing environment while she was in JAIL.", "can she just launder some more money and buy a bigger house? \n\nNTA. what a weird thing to complain about.", "Well thats it people, conclusive evidence the systems does not work and people are not re-habilitated. \n\nYou took care of your niece and tried to do a good job and put a lot of effort in. The only words your sisters gets to say on this subject is \"thank you\". She can come over once a month and switch the books she keeps at her moms.", "Get your niece a bookshelf and donate the ones shes read.  Problem solved .", "It's time to let your sister mother her daughter.   I commend you for being there for your niece.

Maybe she should have had foresight around how money laundering would deprive her child of a mother for five years? It\u2019s the audacity for me.", "Well, my first thought was 200 books don't take up that much space. Then I realized most people probably don't have a house that looks like mine with bookcases everywhere.\n\nI recommend you store most of them for her and let her decide what to do with them when she's on her own. At her age, honestly, it won't be that long.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nFrom reading this, I don't think you could be further from AH status. Books are so important for development, and you helped nurture your niece. Your sister is probably hurting and not dealing with the flood of emotions right now.", "NTA. If you want to raise your kids the way you want, which I guess in this case means without books, don\u2019t launder money. \n\nMaybe you could get your niece a Kindle or other E-reader.", "yeah right. you are the asshole for being a good brother / uncle. how dare you spoil a child that lost her parent to prison for a third of her life. you utter disgusting fool /s\n\nhow ungrateful can one human be? you could have let your niece go in foster care, instead you gave he a lovely time, while she waited on her criminal mother to be released. \n\nNTA buy your niece some more !", "NTA. Doesn't sound like prison had a very good impact on her. Will she earn another trip or at 18 will your niece decide to move out and back in with her uncle who treated her right? Time will tell.", "Right, you're at fault. Going to jail had nothing to do with it. NTA", "Petty me: \"Well, my life was made more difficult by you not foreseeing being imprisoned for money laundering.\"\n\nNon-petty: I wonder if it's jarring for your sister to see precisely how long she was in prison for. Her daughter can't fit the amount of weeks she was gone into her bedroom.\n\nNow that the rush of being reunited is over, she has to confront you were raising her daughter and the world didn't freeze while she was gone.\n\nIt's not about the books. NTA", "why is that NAH", "Five at a time does sound reasonable.\n\nNo, I\u2019m not gonna get rid of them.", "What?", "Yes that's my comment.   Buying the books because she doesn't want her niece to forget how much she is loved, missed, and treasured.    It's her way of staying relevant in a little girls heart who she loves as her own.    I am not belittling the aunt at least that's not my intention.  It is time she let her sister mother her daughter.", "Because the sister can't help feeling jealous of the time she missed and OP didn't do anything wrong.", "Yeah, buying the books isn't the issue. If they live in a 1BR apartment, and you and your neice insist on all 200 books going immediately, yes, that's a problem. \n\n\nIs she fighting to take all of them?", "I am sorry that I didn't make myself clear.    I commend the aunt who gave her niece five years of a stable home full of love and comfort.    I did put yta because I was asked if buying a new book nearly every week was an asshole thing to do.  And I think she is feeling left out of her nieces life and the books are her pain because she doesn't know what to do with herself.    I don't know how I could let go of a child that I loved as my own.", "Its not your emotion making you an asshole. How you act on or express your feelings decides if your an asshole or not.", "But she *can* help her behavior in response to her feelings."]}
