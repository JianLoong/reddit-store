Do you have a lease? Does it say anything about using the fridge or freezer?", "Oh man, she's going to have a tough time policing the whole world to hide all the junk food from her kids!\n\nShe can't evict you over this.\n\nNTA", "I have no idea where you live, but nowhere in the USA is it legal to evict you for buying junk food.  You should just remind her of that next time she brings it up.", "NTA. If this is such a big thing for Carla she should've made it clear before you moved in. The majority of people buy and eat junk food, shock horror.", "NTA. Your diet is none of her business, if she doesn't want her children seeing your junk food then I suggest you get a separate mini fridge and mini freezer. Also She can't kick you out for any reason without giving you a full notice period.\n\nShe's not your friend she's your land lady, check over your contract and read it fully. It might be time to look for some where else to live.", "NTA. \n\nHow much would it cost you per month to eat out when you're craving junk food? Because that's the amount I'd want my rent reduced by in order to comply with her unreasonable request.", "Nta and OP I\u2019d highly recommend just finding a new place. You are paying her rent. She cannot dictate what you eat just because she doesn\u2019t know how to parent her children. If you do compromise it will be setting a precedent that you bend to her will. And who knows what\u2019s next after that, if she decides the way you dress is a bad influence on her kids, she\u2019s gonna expect you to compromise. Let her find someone who shares those valves.", "NTA, but consider getting a small fridge for your bedroom to keep the peace, you know?", "NTA, you can\u2019t be evicted for the type of groceries you buy. I\u2019m assuming your lease is a written contract? You could take her to court for that.", "NTA, I don\u2019t think a junk food eviction will hold up.  However, don\u2019t expect her to renew your lease.  Might want to start looking.", "NTA. But it might be worth discussing a compromise to save yourself some trouble of having to move if she isn\u2019t bluffing.\n\nLike if you can put stuff in non-see through bags or get a mini-fridge in your room.", "NTA but try to find another place to live. She sounds annoying.", "If it means that much to Carla that OP stop buying junk food, then what is it worth? How much of a reduction in rent is she willing to accept to have OP stop buying junk food? OP is definitely NTA but Carla needs to pony up and make it worth OP\u2019s effort (and offset the cost as it is more expensive to eat \u201chealthy,\u201d unfortunately).", "NTA, once she agreed to rent a room and share communal spaces with a tenant in exchange for money, she gave up the power to control what's in the fridge. She can burn through tenants until she finds one she can control, or maybe she'll eventually realise that paying tenants get to choose what foods they buy and eat.\n\nYou should have 1 shelf clearly labelled and she can say to the kids, \"no, that's not your food, that's OPs food, we don't eat food like that\". There are actual parenting techniques to help kids through those meltdowns when they're told they're not allowed what they want.", "NAH, but just start putting your junk food in a bag or opaque container.  The kids won't ask for what they don't see.  No harm, no foul.", "NAH but could you hide the food? Put the food into boxes or bags or packaging of stuff the kids wouldn\u2019t eat? Paper bag that says butchers special, bull testicles or something? Maybe mom can save some packaging from her food to use as camouflage?", "NAH.  Carla doesn't like that you are setting this example for her children.  She will pick them over you.  Maybe you could buy a little refrigerator for your own room with a lock on it, and then don't let the kids see it.  Or look for another place where you don't have to hide it.  It sounds like you are about to get booted.", "NAH. You are free to eat what you want and so is Carla. She also has the right to decide no junk food for her kids. But as your landlord she does have the right to evict you legally. Depending on the laws where you are she can\u2019t just kick you out, but she should be to give you notice, depending on your lease agreement. \n\nYour best bet, if you want to continue living there, is to get a mini fridge for your room and keep junk food there.", "NAH. The mom is understandably frustrated at having food she doesn't want brought in the house. It's hard to avoid temptation when it's shoved in your face. I don't think it's unreasonable to not want junk food in the house all the time with kids around. You deserve to eat what you want as an adult though.\n\nI feel like this is one of those things that just isn't going to end well. I hope you can find a compromise. Maybe ask the parents about splitting the cost of a mini fridge for your room?\n\n.", "NAH and in her shoes I'd just wait and then not renew your lease. You're not a fit for her home, she's stuck with you legally through the lease, after that she can fine someone else and you can have all the junk food you want in the next fridge. You're not an ass for buying junk food, neither is she for not wanting that shit in her house. \n\n\nDepending on where you live though, sharing essentials like a kitchen often mean it's not a tenant situation in the same way in eyes of the law and you may have very limited rights if she wants to evict you", "ESH\n\nShe is your landlord and your housemate and she is not comfortable with some of your products in the fridge. Her request is a little over the top, but you are going to have to deal with it. Rather than giving her the metaphorical finger, your could just get a non-transparent box to hold your foods out of sight in the fridge, of you could get your own fridge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
