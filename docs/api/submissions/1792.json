Problem solved.", "NTA but it sounds like she has all the leverage. Just get a mini fridge for your room.", "NTA", "NTA. It's up to her to parent her children. Also she will absolutely have zero grounds in eviction court and waste a shitload of money.\n\nedit: saw that you were in the UK and idk the laws there, but either way you're still NTA.", "Could you come to an agreement where they provide or you buy a mini fridge for your room?", "Can you not just keep your food wrapped in the bags it came in so that the label is not visible when opening the fridge or freezer? Like, it's not that hard?", "It\u2019s legal everywhere in the us what are you even saying", "Ya but all she has to do is say \"you have a month to leave \" and that's pretty much it", "Which part? Scotland has a rent freeze at the moment and she couldn't evict you", "The idea is to encourage use of spare rooms but you have less rights than a tenant? I'm an American so I can really say shit at all but lol", "Can corroborate \nSource - niece of an 82 woman who has been trying to evict her non-paying tenant since before Covid who is still paying the monthly Maintence and taxes on a fixed income in NYC", "Find a new place to live. Period. \n\nShe is going past the line of passive aggressive.\n\nAnd if you refuse to that do two things:\n\na) buy a small fridge and microwave for your room.\nb) put a lock on your door. \n\nIf she complains move out. \n\nBut I would move out first. And find someone with the same values as yourself.", "It's not a favor if you're paying rent. And if you have an agreement it would likely be more difficult to evict you over junk food. You might prefer to find a new place though. \n\nAsk for a small fridge for your room. Or keep your food in bags, even in the fridge/freezer so her kids only see it when you're eating it. Plenty of kids grow up with two sets of rules for two different houses. Hers will survive.\n\nETA NTA", "NTA but she's your landlord so it's really not worth antagonizing her. \n\nGet some boxes with really unattractive food on them, like broccoli or whatever the kids hate. Slip your food into the broccoli boxes before putting it in the fridge. Voila!", "NTA, also her kids are going to have awful relationships with food when they grow up.", "NTA.  You have a right to buy the food you want to eat and keep it in the kitchen when you are paying rent.  It is none of her business what you eat and her kids shouldnt even be in the fridge if they are too young to understand that some of the food is yours.", "NTA - your body your choice. Buy a plastic box that is not see through for the fridge stuff so they don\u2019t see it. That should help.", "NTA, you are entitled to eat whatever you choose. It might be a different story if her child had an extreme allergy or there was some legitimate religious practices that had been clearly laid out before you moved in. But this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at all. Sounds like she is going through a crunchy phase and is getting a bit of self righteous indignation going on. Sorry to hear you are dealing with it. You don\u2019t deserve that.", "Find a new place to live ASAP.\nNTA.", "I dont know where you are getting that info... \n\nyou can evict anyone for any reason if they are renting a room, not an apartment, at least in my state.\n\nBut regardless,  I feel that OP is NTA. Honestly, mini fridges are cheap, so if the landlord has so much issue with OP using the amenities offered by the rental agreement, they should have offered to buy a mini fridge and ask them to squirrel away the bad food there. Get a lock on it so stickey fingers dont help themselves", "Besides what is she gonna do ,cut the TV cable and never take the kids in the city?never allow  them  to read ? Advertising  is everywhere.  Nta", "That's hardly the same thing though. They might whine about it but explaining to kids that adults have different sleep schedules isn't the same as having food lying around tempting them constantly. OP is NTA but hiding it in unmarked bags would be pretty reasonable, Carla seems extreme but she has a bit of a point that her kids shouldn't be eating that stuff, and she's trying to be better than our abysmally unhealthy society. They might see it out in the store but it's damn hard to maintain a healthy diet if you regularly keep junk food in the house and she has a right to keep her house temptation free and housemates should respect that at least enough to keep it out of plain view which is an incredibly minor effort on their part.", "Maybe a solution is to place your snacks in a concealed box in the fridge so the kids don't see it.", "Get a mini freezer and put everything in your room... I can recommend a good model if you want as I have one because pandemic removed accessible food", "Landlady sounds unhinged. Could you ask them to provide you with your own fridge?

What state do you live in that allows a landlord to evict someone with a lease?", "It's legal in the US to evict a tenant with a lease... because they have \"junk food\" in the refrigerator??\n\nYeah, I don't think so. \n\n(OP isn't even in the US, so the point is moot.)", "Vermont.
