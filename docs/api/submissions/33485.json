You did not want your daughter to be overly stressed, and you offered the worst case scenario as a realistic and ok option. Your daughter needs to learn that very few things in this world will actually end up mattering and most of them are not worth the stress.

She really seems to care too much about her grades to the point that it depresses and isolates her, and that isn't healthy. The message that \"it doesn't matter what grade you get, it matters how much you tried\" is a great one, because grades really don't show how intelligent you are, and sometimes they won't show accurately how much you tried. It's a great lesson that grades don't define your worth as a person.\n\nHowever, you saying that \"no one cares\" if she fails isn't helpful. It's not that you don't care. You should care that your daughter does her best and tries to succeed. Saying basically that it doesn't matter how you do in school reinforces the idea that you don't have to try hard, because no one will care if you fail. While the grades don't matter as much in high school, the work ethic kids can learn there is very important, and telling her to just not study isn't the same as saying \"it matters how much you tried\".\n\nInstead of letting go of some of the stress your daughter experiences when doing her best to study, she just stopped studying, just gave up, and quitting is not a lesson she should learn.\n\nEdit: By \"stopped studying\", I am talking about her Comp Sci exam, not in general.", "I can see why your daughter has test anxiety. You two seem like a real collective piece of work. Why don't you just leave her alone about her grades, as long as she's trying her best?\n\nAs for punishing a kid for grades, that's only effective if she's NOT trying her best, and by that I mean, refusing to study, refusing to turn in work, refusing to take school seriously.

Obsessively perfectionistic about school and grades. No pressure from either parent, they were mostly just in awe of my grades and wanted to support me. They often encouraged me to take a mental health day because I would get myself so worked up. \n\nOne thing that they didn\u2019t do great in, however, was how they handled my lack of self-confidence. Whenever I inevitably had a meltdown about being unprepared and feeling I\u2019d fail the test, they would jump to comforting me by telling me how smart I was and how they knew I\u2019d do fine. \n\nThey meant well, trying to reassure me they had total faith in my talents and the work I put in, but the way I experienced it was \u201cwe expect you\u2019ll do great because you always do,\u201d the flip side of which I filled in as \u201cso if you don\u2019t do well we won\u2019t be proud of you and you\u2019ll be a failure.\u201d \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I got a D+ on an organic chem test in college that I was able to articulate for them: I don\u2019t want them to tell me they know I\u2019ll do great, I want them to tell me they love me and are proud of me and I\u2019m just as smart and hardworking EVEN IF I get a D on a test. After that their approach changed a bit and it helped. \n\nI\u2019m now a doctor but I regret having done so. In retrospect though there wasn\u2019t as much overt pressure to become a doctor as many of my friends have faced, my parents definitely were invested in my becoming a doctor, and when I had times where I expressed my opinion it didn\u2019t seem like a good fit for me long term, they encouraged me to stay on track because it would all be worth it. In the end, it absolutely was not worth it, and I wish I had listened to myself and my own instincts more. \n\nSo all of that is to say - I see a LOT of my younger self in your daughter. I am still crippled by anxiety (despite nearly 20 years in therapy and appropriate medication) and am very aware of how my parents comments on and discussions about my academic performance played into it. Maybe unlike some other commenters, I think OP\u2019s actions here send a really helpful and powerful message about him having his daughter\u2019s back and also being realistic (as opposed to idealistic like my parents seemed to be). Especially if mom does seem to have distorted ideas about academic success, this kind of concrete action that you back your kid up on can have a very lasting impression that her self worth and approval from her parents is not dependent on all straight A\u2019s.

Getting an F is a hard hole to dig yourself out of.", "Hey OP, I was a kid in a similar situation to your daughter. For me, an A was expected, B was disappointing, and below a B was failing. Those expectations\u2014and fear of punishment if I didn\u2019t meet them\u2014destroyed my mental health and, to a degree, my physical health. I pushed myself to the point of not eating, not sleeping, and even blacking out from exhaustion by trying to meet those expectations.\n\nFor your daughter\u2019s sake, please talk to your wife and then your daughter about expectations and consequences. Seeing below a B as failure isn\u2019t healthy and, in higher education, completely false. Everyone has a bad class in university. I don\u2019t know whether your daughter is in high school or uni, but either way the expectation of B or higher is going to hurt her in the long term.\n\nThat said, the all and nothing thinking that resulted in her axing one exam and failing the other isn\u2019t great either, and it doesn\u2019t teach effective time management strategies. This is a period where your daughter should be given the room to experiment with time management and study methods to learn what works for her and what doesn\u2019t. Sometimes that will mean lower grades, because mistakes are part of the learning process. \n\nYou need to make sure that your daughter will (1) not be punished for mistakes/performance* and (2) knows that academic performance will not affect how much your love and care for her (and it shouldn\u2019t!!)\n\n*Note that mistakes and lack of care are different. It doesn\u2019t seem like your daughter lacks care or sense of responsibility, so be very careful before considering something intentional negligence rather than a genuine mistake or part of learning/growing pains\n\nHolding the expectations your wife has for your daughter are actively contributing to her anxiety and stress, and can cause long term health issues, both mentally and physically. Long term stress causes physical issues, including heart problems and (in my case) stress induced seizures. Not saying that\u2019s the point your daughter is at, but that it could get to that point if your daughter continues to feel pressure from you and your wife to have such high academic performance.\n\nShe\u2019s also in a period where a lot of young people, especially girls/women, develop more insecurities about themselves\u2014in terms of body image, social expectations/status, job and career prospects, personal relationships, etc\u2026 This is an extremely important period for her to know that she is loved and supported. Make sure you actively tell her that she is, and whatever you do, do NOT tie it to her performance in school (and be careful not to *imply* that it is).

But she is a very minor asshole here and she was only an asshole because you told her it was OK to be an asshole.\n\nYOU AND YOUR WIFE who, instead of getting your daughter a tutor or a study coach or test anxiety accommodations or literally anything that would actually have helped her, and instead downplayed her need to study and leaving her to sink or swim on subjects. Bonus points to your wife for wanting to punish her for failing an exam after you told her, it was perfectly OK to fail an exam which, let\u2019s be clear, it\u2019s not.\n\nYta. Get a grip on your parenting and get your kid some help.", "YTA.  You get an F on this parenting assignment.  Telling her doing her best is vastly different than telling her it is ok to fail.  You need to apologize to your wife, and tell her you were wrong. You daughter is obviously capable of better.", "YTA, both for encouraging her to give in to her anxiety instead of coping, and for not getting her help to cope. I am this person, I was this kid. I\u2019m 26 now and I am *not doing well* because I didn\u2019t get help for my academic and general life anxiety. Once she leaves school that anxiety will translate to jobs and relationships. It will crush her. It will cause serious damage. PLEASE get her to a therapist to work through this, whether with diet/exercise/talk therapy or even medication. This is the beginning of a road you don\u2019t want to go down and she shouldn\u2019t have to.", "Hi! I'm your daughter from another set of parents (as in my parents were the same in wanting me to have B's or above in everything because \"I'm not average\" like it's some sort of crime to be average but whatever). Let me tell you that, from her perspective, all that expectation and stress of grades comes from not only you but the academic world as well. Teachers are evaluated on how well their students test and, therefore, they stress students out just to make sure they make \"good grades\". Then there's the \"you need good grades to get into a good college!\" and...for what? More EXPENSIVE schooling to earn a degree in something because jobs need it? And then when you go apply for said jobs, what then? Where does the stress end?!\n\nSo I did all that, I got grounded when I got a C or below in anything, I felt like a failure and that my parents wouldn't love me (despite them telling me they did even if they were \"disappointed\" by my grades), and that I got so stressed out in High School/College to the point I felt like I was a failure to everyone and that nothing I did would ever matter all because of a sub-par grade. Something that is completely arbitrary since some teachers will just grade on a whim or use their personal biases against a student just because. And I nearly un-alived myself a few times because of that feeling of failure (thankfully never followed through any of the times I had breakdowns) and pushed through even if it meant graduating a year and a half behind my parent's expectations and getting that coveted BA.... \n\nBut you know what? I don't use my degree at all and haven't since I got it. I got a degree in English but never wanted to teach (and that's pretty much all it's useful for) and now work in finances. I put invoices into a computer system and I didn't need a degree in finances or computers for it and I make enough to be comfortable in life and have a house, get married, all those fun milestones that people enjoy in life. But a degree didn't mean shit in the end. PLEASE tell your wife 1 bad grade that lowers your daughters average isn't the end of the world and it actually probably helped her out in more ways than one. It lowered her average overall and that's ok. She failed at something and that's ok! No one should fear failing something and then being punished for it, especially when you (as her parent) already told her that she wouldn't be punished for it. If your wife continues to pursue that path, that's going to make a giant rift between you two as well as set your daughter up for future stress over possibly failing at ANYTHING in life. \n\nFor your daughters mental sake, please let this failure go and just let her learn from it that mental health is much, much important than arbitrary grades and that her parents love and support her no matter what. Good luck and you're NTA but your wife will be if she punishes her for something your daughter desperately needed.", "ESH. You and your wife need to be on the same page. Also your advice of you can fail one exam if you pass the other is terrible advice. Setting strict B or below as failing is also bad advice. Some classes are designed around a perfect bell curve. The average students will finish with Cs. I've been in my fair share of these classes and while they suck you also learn that getting a C doesn't end your life and isn't a failure. \n\nAssuming this is high school or below your daughter should get used to multiple tests in a single day. Hell when I was in college I had classes end on Friday, a final at 7AM Saturday and another final at 2PM Saturday. That was somewhat uncommon at the time but something I had to adapt to. She needs to learn what final needs more attention in terms of studying. It's a skill a lot of people, including myself, struggled to learn.", "So you may need to see someone about your daughter's potential anxiety, and also your wife and you shouldn't punish your daughter, it will just put her under a lot of stress", "NTA - can your wife explain why she thinks it's important?

You gave horrible advice and you, seemingly, haven\u2019t taken your daughter to get help. Her grades do matter if she wants to get into college, and with courses like that, I assume the answer is yes.

Stop being *lazy* and start helping your daughter.", "ESH except your daughter\n\nYou:  After you told your daughter that no one would care, and definitely not you or you wife, you should have gone immediately to your wife to give her a \"heads up\" that you had had this conversation. It sounds like your wife only found out about your advice after the report card results came out.  This left your wife blindsided and your daughter vulnerable.  Not good.\n\nYour wife:  Your wife wants to punish your daughter?  Even after you explained what happened?  That's messed up.  I think we can see where your daughter gets the idea that outcome matters more than process.", "You and your wife are both TA. Let me explain. \n\nI had a very similar experience to your daughter growing up. My mom was a perfectionist who considered anything below a B to be failing (but even a B was pushing it), while my dad was more lax. As long as I wasn\u2019t *actually* failing, he didn\u2019t care, and sort of just went along with whatever my mom said. My mom\u2019s perfectionism made me feel like I was nothing more than a trophy for her to flaunt, and that I had to make good grades to keep her happy. This led to depression and the severe anxiety your daughter seems to be experiencing. \n\nYour wife has 1,000% given your daughter severe anxiety and a complex about making good grades. If you truly have your daughter\u2019s best interests at heart, you will get her the help she needs and take her to a mental health professional. You should absolutely NOT punish her. \n\nAdditionally, you should probably sit your wife down and have a conversation with her about how she may be damaging your daughter, and encourage her to get help as well. Don\u2019t continue to passively allow her to f**k up your kid. \n\nHope this helps.", "Ssoooo your wife wants to punish her for failing and your daughter already has issues with exam stress and the NEED to perform. \nThat\u2019s the perfect combination for your daughter to completely lose her shit and fail miserably everywhere.\nYou\u2019re not the AH, your wife is for putting all the pressure", "YTA for making your daughter's grades more important than her mental health. Her grades are important to HER future and HER life after she moves out. In reality, they affect you very little except in the way that you probably like to brag about them, or the way you say \"In our family a B is failing\". \n\nApologize to your daughter about trying to control her. Support her when she gets a good grade (Physics is HARD!) and sympathize when she gets a bad grade. Her grades, like your work evaluations, are her business. Get therapy for you and your wife to delve into why you are so status driven that you'd push your child so hard. \n\nRelevant experience: mom to two girls who did just fine/are doing just fine in school even though I could not tell you a single grade they got. Oldest is on her way to grad school (completely paid for with scholarship) because she did so well in her highly selective undergrad program. Youngest is a senior in HS currently applying for college and I have no idea what her GPA is. Since they were small I have said \"Did you do your best?\" when they took a test and were happy or sad about the grade. We always pushed them to take the hardest classes they could, but did not press them on grades.", "So you guys punish her when she gets \u201cbad\u201d grades and wonder why she is making herself ill studying for her exams? YTA, not for making your kid \u201cfail\u201d but for allowing things to get this bad in the first place. Your wife obviously has a very unhealthy attitude towards your daughter\u2019s achievements and it\u2019s going to mess up her mental health and create burnout before she\u2019s even reached adulthood at this rate.", "Punishing her would be pointless and cruel. Punishment should not be transactional. You should be finding a way to help your daughter solve the actual problem, which is her extreme perfectionism. She'll probably need a counselor.

And now she wants the daughter punished despite this being the wife's fault in the first place.\n\nThe wife is the source of the problem. She's also creating the anxiety for his daughter.\n\nIn short the biggest asshole here is the Wife. \n\nAnd really I doubt the daughter overstudying is doing her any good at this point.

You don't disseminate the information you actually need to know.", "WTF How is it a bad thing to say ignore a subject that is not important to her career? By 15, she would have learnt the every day basics anyway and it seems she has a very precise path planned out since she knows which 3 subjects matter to her.

I suspect the daughter's anxiety would drop significantly if the wife learned how to chill", "Nah, not caring is the right mindset. Mom is making certain she is pushed.\n\n\nUntil I stopped caring about results I could not let go of anxiety. Care about the work, the preparation, the knowledge, but exam results are not a concern, they will be whatever depending on luck, effort, skill, intelligence.", "This. Although with the given information I agree with OP\u2019s decisions to not care about computer science. Thing is that if she was able to focus on studying Physics, aced her test, and her parents were supportive of her to further improve in future, then she will learn how to efficiently study for her exam. Also she will cognitively differentiate between studying and achieving results she wants or not studying and failing. In short, what she does will define her personality and perception instead of her personality defining her actions, which is crucial. It seems that her test anxiety was born out of some trauma (maybe teacher yelled or her parents said something wrong, I don\u2019t know). But in this case, for an anxious person, the expectation itself to study for both exams and trying to ace them has a high chance of failure, thus even the study time can induce anxiety. If she got Cs or Bs on both of them, I am not very sure how she would have felt. It is all about what type of reinforcement she gets to combat her anxiety which I think will need a doctor.", "This is a great answer. I\u2019m a teacher, so I see a lot of family dynamics just like this one. Additionally, I was a VERY anxious child who is still unlearning that my worth is not directly tied to my ability to achieve.

But yeah I agree that she should see a doctor for that. \n\nWhere he might be wrong is telling her to not study for the exam. He could have told her to just spare a couple of hours for it, to go over the important things. That way she might not have an F.

Also highly dependable on the field you\u2019re in but the economy/rate of employment isn\u2019t the greatest for most currently. For example, I was quite satisfied with my 83% average until I saw that competitive masters programs see 80% as the bare minimum, so all of a sudden I viewed my objectively good grades as subpar.

Took me a long time to work through that and now Im in my late 20s just now working through college", "I completely agree!", "That\u2019s so sad to hear. I know art programs keep getting cut and people like to say art isn\u2019t a good career but like ?? who will our artists be if we don\u2019t let them have that creative outlet?? I hate that so many schools have cut these classes in favor of other stuff (or sports). If I could choose where my tax dollars went I\u2019d pick art and teachers over everything else. \n\nI\u2019m lucky my high school didn\u2019t have a football team so we didn\u2019t have many sports to spend money on \ud83e\udd2a", "I had parents like this-- a mom who thought anything but As and Bs would lead to a screaming match and punishment and a dad who couldn't care less about my grades. \n\nI don't talk to my critical mom at all anymore and am low contact with my absent dad. I also have anxiety because of the pressures put on me by my overbearing mother and struggle with self-doubt and self-hate when I don't put in 150%. When I do that, I burnt myself out because it's not sustainable.\n\nYou need to get on the same page with your wife (and tell her to get some perspective). And to be clear, your wife thinking anything below a B as failing is exactly why your daughter pushes herself too hard before exams. Not eating? You need to address this now before it gets worse.", "Yeah, I don't think either parent handles this well. \n\nThe OP shouldn't have spoken for his wife when the wife is clearly contributing to this unhealthy grade fixation. *Punishing* a kid for a low grade - are we right out of Victorian children's literature? And in a case where the child followed the dad's advice to accept a likely low grade as a swap for a high grade where it counted more for her. \n\nThere's a reason that a C- is not a failing grade! (Not at the HS level at least - it is typically at the grad school level.) That one grade will be completely irrelevant in the bigger context of her life - except if she and her mother make it so. \n\nChildren need to learn how to deal with failure. Before college if possible. She's at a great age to draw lessons from that, but it sounds like neither parent are prepared to guide her well in this.", "Also, a final grade of C or even C- is still passing and is average. It means your daughter is meeting the expectations of what was to be learned. B is exceeding those expectations, and an A is above that, meaning practically all knowledge about the subject has been retained and understood. \n\nYour wife may need to take a step back and realize that not everyone is perfect. And this is the time for your daughter to learn that putting in the effort can be good but not to the point of causing that much anxiety. The anxiety over having to be perfect will cause many more problems in life than getting Cs in High School.\n\nNTA", "The effect it had on me was I just will not try for anything I can't be near perfect or 'impressive' on.\n\nI went to a magnet program in HS half the day for math and science...skipped a grade in English at my home HS.....captained two varsity sports, 3.65 GPA 29 on my ACTs, full ride academics to a state school (I didn't use because it was too close to home and I just *had* to get away)\n\nAnd the fuckers still made me feel like I was failing all the time.  I have no memories of them ever even attempting to help me with homework....it was just sit there and have mandatory study hours at the kitchen table.\n\nOut of spite....and I'm surprised I had the resolve to do this....I literally would stare blankly into a book for an hour, not turning the page or reading anything.\n\nThey had me getting my agenda signed by all my teachers after class, and a weekly meeting with the school counselor to check on things.  I REFUSE to use a planner to this day mostly because of that shit. (Which is dumb of me IK)", "Same.

I panicked when I got 80-84 (still a B in college).\n\nOn the plus side(?) I will never forget the rules of significant figure rounding, lol. (1-4 rounds down, 6-9 rounds up. 5 rounds to the even number. My physics teacher looked at her class full of overachieving honors students and said \"If I calculated your grades using significant figures, a 92.5 would be a B.\" I can still revert the horror that inspired almost 30 years later.)", "Ah yes the ever-giving gift of second guessing \ud83d\ude44", "> Yes a C is a passing grade, but high schoolers aren\u2019t just trying to \u201cpass\u201d high school. You don\u2019t get very far in life with just a high school diploma if you have high aspirations for your future\n\nThis is completely false. There's so many jobs out there that you can do and aspire too that will pay you well and give you a lot of success. It's actually this mindset that is so poisonous to young people these days where they feel like they **have** to go to college and get some type of degree to be successful. There are trade schools, there's just working a job and using that experience to get further along and move into different things.\n\nI have a HS diploma, never went to college, and I worked construction when I was younger, and I took that knowledge and I have moved into aerospace, first fabrication, and then quality inspection and advanced inspections. I have built a career and still have a very high pay ceiling. I was also picked over people with college degrees because I had actual experience that was relevant and valuable.\n\nDoes it depend on what daughter is wanting to do? Sure, but still she can achieve her goals without going to the most prestigious school that wants to be so far up it's own ass it will look at a report card and decide whether or not someone is *worthy* to be considered", "Fair", "It was a bad therapist not therapy that hurt you.

OP is not exactly wording things the best way but it doesn't make him an AH. She got a C- anyway so it doesn't matter. I graduated summa cum laude and the entire time in university, I calculated what I needed to do to get the grade I wanted. I had one professor that allowed homework to be submitted at any time during the semester, and he asked me why I didn't submit one. I told him I simply didn't want to- it was much harder than the other assignments and not worth much so I didn't do it. I still had an A in the class. This girl needs to learn how to prioritize like this, not just with other classes but also with her mental help, and OP is helping her do that. I wish I had a parent like that.", ">you should not tell her not to care, but to relax and set things in perspective\n\nIsn't that essentially what the OP did by telling his daughter to prioritise the exam she needed to pass at the expense of the one that she didn't need?", "You're her father and she's a minor. She doesn't have to agree. Book the appointment, and take her to it.", "As someone who has insanely bad anxiety that started at a very young age, get her a psychologist ASAP, not a therapist, not because they aren't good, but if she needs medication to help a psychologist can do that and have a treatment plan and be a part of the process without having to involve a second doctor, it can get confusing. \n\nMy mom got me help at a young age, but there was a lot I would hide and regret the way I handled my therapy but it kept me open to going back later in life when I was in a more comfortable place, even having sessions with a parent in the room to discuss worries you have with your child in a safe environment and a third impartial party can be extremely helpful to get a point across especially with anxiety. Well, it was helpful for me at least, but it helped me feel like it was an actual safe place because I wasn't alone and didn't feel like there was an issue with just \"me\" and instead it's more of a universal feeling, just stronger in me than others around me and I need help to manage it and others want to help me do that. \n\nIf she isn't into having a parent with her (I also have attachment issues), group therapy is also really great for anxiety and not feeling so alone in it.

I took math for 3 different semesters. I did them all after each other, but I could've waited, I just wanted to get it over with all at once. \n\nPerhaps this is INFO we need from OP though."]}
