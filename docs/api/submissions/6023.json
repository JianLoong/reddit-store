We don't have any extended family so she isn't going to have anyone to talk to and she isn't the type to go socialize and make friends.

However I am struggling with sympathy because she chose to marry that asshole Kyle, and she has been a pain in the ass about the wedding.\n\nMy mom only has two friends. Her best friend \"Meg\" is just nasty and has said horrible things about us. She is 100% not invited. Her other friend \"Ella\" seems fine, so I asked my mom about her. My mom told me that Ella isn't willing to come due to an affair between her husband and my future MIL years ago. she said it really fucked Ella up mentally and she never wants to see MIL again. Then my mom smirked and said since we are \"ruining her life\" by not letting her bring Kyle and causing her so much anxiety, we should uninvite MIL so she can bring Ella.\n\nObviously that isn't an option and at that point I lost my temper. I yelled at her that we would never uninvite MIL who has always been a kickass mom for my bitch mom who choses some guy over her child, and if she wants to be with an asshole who speaks like that she deserves this anxiety. I said we will never chose her over MIL which must suck knowing I don't even like MIL. \n\nI don't know if I took it too far, because she already has the attitude that my in laws are treated better and being a boy mom sucks, and she has already pulled away a lot due to those feelings.", "created_utc": 1672412301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz2i40/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_mom_for_making_a/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
