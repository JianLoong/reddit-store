When my ex and I broke up, my brother asked about the plus one because he wanted to make sure he didn't need to change any seat arrangements. I told him not to worry and that \"I'll bring someone with me.\" I guess he thought I was already moving on to my next relationship one week after breaking up?", "o hot damn that is good one!", "[removed]", "Also my personal favorite RR, on camping, said with great incredulity: \"Why would I want to pretend I don't have a house?\"", "She is so awesome. Off to YouTube!!!", "Love to hear this!", "Good on them. Apparently 4th times the charm for your cousin.\n\nOOo just had a thought, tell cousin to get the wife a charm bracele with charms of 4 (four leaf clover for example)", "Indeed", "Nothing says you can't stand outside the venue with a sign saying \"I'm sorry, give me another chance. I have good feelings about marriage #4\"", "Lol if your family tries to get you to apologize or any of that just say the invitation never stated it had to be someone I'm with.", "Hear me out. Hobo stripper.", "Of course you will, who else we bro have to be mad at for no reason?", "A German guy posted, I think on this sub, just other day about how he took a prostitute he sees regularly to a wedding as his +1.", "Who gives a +1 but expects the guest not to bring a pole dancer or whoever?", "Maybe New Wife is homophobic and brother is the type to let his partners dictate his personality.", "If you moved as fast as your brother you could have been accompanied by a spouse\u2026", "And the invitation arrived how long ago? Like, your brother does realize that most people the age of you guys don't consider a relationship of six months or less \"long term\", right?", "A new long-term partner.... who would also be a stranger to them?", "Oh gosh, this info could really do with being added to the post.", "Reminded of John Pinette on camping (Sorry I know I\u2019ve probably butchered it). \u201c \u2018It\u2019s like the pilgrims.\u2019 I think they did what they had to do, built a foundation so we could live in houses, not in tents. If Lewis and Clarke had had a Hilton, they wouldn\u2019t have camped.\u201d", "Dad's friend was on his 5th wife; he said if he'd met her first he'd have been married once.", "Eh, they'll have to get used to silence ig.", "Good for him, I hope they had a fun time.", "Yeah, guess that's more likely huh... idk, still feels like it's not that tbh", "To be honest, I didn't think it made a difference? I mean, I feel like it's totally normal to bring a friend as a plus one\u2014unless I'm weird and that's actually a faux pas.", "Maybe they\u2019re that type of couple that picks petty fights with other people because having a common enemy is the only way they can distract themselves from the fact that they can\u2019t stand each other.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird at all to want a friend there when you\u2019ve just been through a breakup.\n\nAlthough I do think that any changes to the plan, run it by the couple.\n\nI think they would have been AHs to refuse in the circumstances and I think they have completely overreacted about the whole thing.\n\nAnd your reply was funny, so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
