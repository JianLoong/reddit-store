It is so rude and inconsiderate to send a surprise gift the size of a television let alone a TWELVE FOOT WIDE surprise gift!\n\nI won't even get into the potential danger of such an item.\n\nSending it back and returning it is the most polite response you could have had.", "NTA there is an underlying issue here that needs to be resolved since you have been communicating what you want from her and she is not giving it to you and she\u2019s overstepping your boundaries. explain to her that these large extravagant gifts are not acceptable and you\u2019ll either regift them or sell them and purchase another gift for your child or she can have them returned. Tell her it will be her choice what to do", "NTA.  In fact, sending it back would be recommended as it's not appropriate, and you probably should have been doing that all along. \n\nAnd if you want further justification, ask your homeowners insurance agent how much having a trampoline affects your premiums.  Depending on where you live, a trampoline can be considered an \"attractive nuisance\", which means that *you* are liable if children break in and injure themselves while using it", "NTA but you need to set firm boundaries with your mil", "NTA. Are you kidding me? That\u2019s 113sq.ft. (plus whatever clearance requirements) of your yard she just tried to claim without asking, and with a potentially dangerous item that you specifically don\u2019t want!\n\nNuts. Send that thing back for sure!", "NTA\n\nNope, not in the least.  There is only one thing I told my wife long before we had children that we would never own and this ONE thing I would not budge and thats a trampoline.  \n\nGetting surprise gifts is cool but you need to establish boundaries.  Since you already made it known you didnt want a trampoline but it arrived anyway, maybe you need to make a list.  Make it of acceptable/unacceptable items or subjects, tickets to theme parks, vacation options, etc.  I dont think her buying is going to stop so at least control the path she goes down.", "NTA, but have you communicated your feelings towards these surprise gifts before? If not, you need to start right away, and place some boundaries.", "Where is your spouse in all of this?  They need to step up, and deal with it.  And instead of selling it or regifting, either tell MIL it's sitting in a landfill, or gift it to a charity she hates in her name.  Like to a democratic campaign if she's  a diehard Trump supporter,  and then tell her every gift that is not pre approved after that will meet the same fate.\n\nThen send her a bill for the delivery fees or landfill fees.", "NTA, but I'd ask her if she wanted to set it up at their house before returning or regifting it, just as a curtesy.", "NTA , It's a completely inappropriate gift for a 2 year old.\n\nYour post suggests you need to set some boundaries with your MIL and ask her to consult with you over any surprise gifts she sends or they will be returned.", "NTA! OMG please call MIL and explain this was inappropriate. You might hold onto it and try to sell it, then get something for your child with essentially her money. Set the boundary and stick to you.", "NTA- I'd return it.  I dont accept any packages that I did not order or be made aware of.", "NTA - a massively sized and potentially harmful gift should at a bare minimum be something that she should have run by you first.", "NTA. \nIf you rent, you might not be able to keep it per your lease and some homeowners insurance will charge you an astronomical rate if you have a full sized trampoline. \nSend it back and tell your MIL that big purchases like that should be run by you and your husband before they're sent. Every time she sends something like this, send it back, period. It's the only way she'll get the point.", "NTA and clearly it upsets you that they send surprise gifts. Maybe I missed it but you should probably address that with them.. after you\u2019ve cooled down.", "Nta. For a 2 yr old? Return it pronto. In the future tell her shes welcome to store toys that aren\u2019t near age appropriate yet or or you don\u2019t have space for at her house, or if she declines, donate. \nOffer her a list of ideas but beyond that I\u2019d just routinely make trips to a local shelter or other donation center, but have no expectations- don\u2019t try to control her, but it\u2019s ok to control what stays. Value the relationship over issues with stuff. As your child gets older they obviously get a voice- the things kids want to keep is so individual and it definitely changes over time naturally. We are rather a minimalist family and it took a few years before my in-laws stopped wasting their money on things we already had, weren\u2019t safe, we had no space for, etc. We tried rotating toys and still had far too many when kids were younger- (to a point), and it was ok became it was just the season we were in. Modeling our own lifestyle at home had much more influence on our kids in the end than all the toys did. Our 19 yr old son literally specified to get him no material things whatsoever for Xmas or his bday last year. He ended up asking for (I was asking repeatedly) a combo gift to help pay for him go to a convention he was interested in- experiences are his focus still. We gifted the grandparents special experiences with the grandchildren they loved - a cooking class or specific activity supplies and planned time to do it. Tickets to zoo/museum, etc. But yeah, a trampoline is a head injury waiting to happen, especially at 2.", "NTA is your partner communicating with your MIL?

It's also a little too big for a gag gift.", "NTA It\u2019s not an appropriate gift for a 2yr old due to safety reasons.

Whoever's related to the person making trouble should take the lead on dealing with them.
