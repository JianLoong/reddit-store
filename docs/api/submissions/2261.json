He typically runs the Dopey Challenge at Disney World every couple years and now he's decided that after our January 2023 Disney trip, he's going to start training for a 100 mile ultramarathon. That means every other weekend he'll be running 20+ miles as well as shorter distances on the non-long run weekends. We recently had our second baby this past June and between running, work, and the masters program he started last November, I've been spending long hours with the kiddos (3 years and 4 months), especially on the weekends. It's wearing on me a ton, especially since I'm also a full-time working mom.\n\nMy husband is really looking for support and encouragement to meet his goal of running an ultramarathon. He wants his parents and I to be his crew during the 30 hour race in August, leaving our then 4 year old and 1 year old with friends for the weekend. We'd be driving from point to point overnight to get him food, supplies, bandage blisters, etc. \n\nI want to be supportive, but I feel like I'm sacrificing so much of my physical and emotional energy to support his personal goals. He also says I told him it was okay when he initially signed up, but now I complain about it all the time. \n\nSo, AITA for not being excited he's running the ultra?\n\nEdit: He does try to schedule runs for early in the morning when we're still asleep. He also does spend time with his kids changing diapers, playing, feeding them, etc. It's just that I don't get much time by myself without the kids. For example, he studied for and took a test on Saturday. I had the kids from when they woke up until about 12:45. I then took an hour nap and we had the kids together the rest of the day. Today, he ran before we woke up, we went out with the kids for a couple hours, and then he was on kid duty while I cleaned the house. Altogether, I probably had 2 hours by myself without kids present all weekend.\n\nEdit #2: Thank you all for your responses, good and bad! I didn't think I'd get anywhere near this amount of responses. I will continue to read and respond to a few, but wanted to say thanks!\n\nEdit #3: There are a number of comments about getting a nanny or babysitter so I wanted to clarify our schedule. Husband and I both work 40 hour weeks and both kids attend daycare M-F.

He gets more time without the kids, works on himself and his hobbies and you don't. No matter how early he wakes up to run, that doesn't sound fair at all especially since it's catching up on you.

If you said you were okay at the start then just complain that's not quite fair on him. You admit he's doing a lot of the running while you're asleep, he's going on outings with the kids, he's taking over the kids in the evening, etc. Sounds like he's doing quite a bit too really on top of schooling and training.

He can do a good job packing his drop bags, the race has loads of support from volunteers, & maybe he can find a pacer (if allowed) to run with him in final shit miles. The most he can expect from you, imo, is a huge congrats at the end & a ride home.\n\nAlso, he jumped right to 100 miler? That's unusual &, to me, foolhardy.

He can do marathons next year but right now his family is in it, and he can support his fitness without committing to a marathon", "My first husband was an everyday runner/marathoner, biked everyday, trail biked weekends, went to the gym 3x a week, and coached work soccer.\n\nOK, so I trained, did a Century, and biked the Teton mountains hoping to spend time together with 1st husband, but seven marriage counselors later in our short 5 yr marriage did nothing for the ache in my soul.  My 2nd husband of 22 years is a wonderful couch potato who makes me so happy.\n\nNTA, OP, and the moral of the story is no one wants to be alone in a marriage.", "When I was running 60-70 miles a week, it was because I was very unhappy in my marriage and wanted out of the house. When I divorced my husband, I stopped running. Now I\u2019m remarried and have started back, but I\u2019m nowhere near what I was back then. I\u2019d ask him if he was running for other reasons \u2014 new baby, master\u2019s program\u2026that\u2019s a lot and he may be running to get away from it. You are NTA, though.", "That is so damn beautiful.", "That would be parenting, of course not!", "Haha no praise is worth the pain of a marathon much less an ultra.  A 5k, maybe.  \n\nRunning is meditation, self-medication, and a little bit of therapy.", "Well that\u2019s not good\u2026that he brings up you agreed to it in the first place.  Tell him \u201cin the first place\u201d was before you had perspective and now that you do, it\u2019s not working for you.  \n\nAlso it sounds like you start to feel a bit of that mom guilt if you don\u2019t spend every waking moment in service to or in the company of your kids/family.  I apologize if I am misinterpreting that.  I\u2019m not the best reader or writer so I\u2019m going off an impression here that I admit may be wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s okay for him and for you to take some time for yourselves. But yeah when one child is barely a year old and the other is still small, I\u2019m not sure how easy it is to do that without help and support.  So I\u2019m not downplaying the difficulty of your situation, but I am hoping you set mom guilt aside if you have any, because it will put blinders on you in seeing opportunities to get yourself a bit more time for just yourself.", "So he will support you in another hobby that takes time away from the family and him\u2026but won\u2019t just devote more time to you and the family as it is? What a strange line to draw in the sand.", "Time to challenge himself to raise the best kids he can for the next 18 years while still making his wife happy. It will be a grueling endurance challenge, but with the help of his parents and wife I think he can pull it off!", "Do you know what the greatest endurance challenge of all time is? It goes non-stop for 18 years.  It is the challenge of being a parent.", "Good point.", "It's possible I'm angry at myself for not having any hobbies rather than angry at him for having one.", "Well that speaks volumes. Does he treat your children with the same disdain for \u201cnon-productive\u201d time?", "If you can find someone to care for your children, he can find someone to stand around holding bandaids. NTA", "How do you know someone is an ultramarathoner?\n\nThey never stop talking about it!", "NTA One partners Goals and Dreams shouldn\u2019t come at the mental or physical detriment to the other.

A partial list of goals and responsibilities, in no particular order:\n\n1. Spouse/relationship\n2. Children (babies no less!)\n3. Career\n4. Hobbies\n5. Education\n6. Adulting/chores/errands\n\nMaybe pick 3-4 of these at any given time. If he wants to keep running like that (marathon addict here \ud83d\udc4b) he can hire a housekeeper and/or babysitter, cut back hours at work, put his degree on hold, etc\u2026 Or cut back on the running FOR A LITTLE WHILE until the kids are a little less needy or his degree is finished. \n\nWhat he\u2019s doing now is putting you on the back burner, and that rarely ends happily for anyone involved. He may do well to think about what his life would look like if you decide you\u2019ve had enough of being a low priority.", "NTA... when this marathon is over consider what hobby you want to take up while husband spends weekends with the kids. Even a few weekends on his own may be educational", "NTA his life is packed, and that's nice but he's not being a good partner because while he gets HIS time off kid duty. You don't get your time off kid duty. Everything else of why doesn't matter. There is an imbalance. Your tank is too empty to support him, because he won't give you time to refill it.", "Being pit crew for a 100 miler was my siblings and my birthday gift to my dad one year, it's a big commitment particularly the first time someone's doing a race that long. I don't have a ton of solid advice for you, but growing up with a runner/ironman parent, we went to a lot of his races where my mom was his crew when we were little. But not when we were really little - I think the earliest I remember was when we were ages 5-9. At that point, we could be left on our own in a hotel room for a little bit or sometimes an older cousin would come along as a babysitter.\n\nWhat I can say right now is that you are NTA for feeling this way. My mom has finally told my dad that it's great he enjoys these races, but when he gets to go away for a race she gets a spa weekend. Because it's his way of relaxing, not hers. And that's fine now that the house is empty. But both people need to have equal time for themselves. Cleaning the house is not your hobby (I assume), so the time he took the kids while you cleaned shouldn't count towards that. Sometimes certain hobbies have to wait until a different point in our lives. Long distance races may be one that needs to wait until the kids are older.\n\nDM me if you want to chat about tips on being a pit crew for runners, particularly the long races. I have some tips that likely won't have come up for a marathon runner. Also, can he take the kids on his weekend runs (not 5-6 hours, but load them in a stroller and go for an hour or three)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: another quick question - are there any (or a certain number) of qualifying races that he has to do to compete in the 100 M? Often the long races require that you've done other shorter (but still long) races in recent history before they'll let you run.", "NTA my dad was/is-ish a marathon runner but when him and my step mom had triplets he put that on hold until they at least get into school full time. It\u2019s great to have hobbies and goals but it\u2019s not fair that only he has time for them. If he found a form of exercise that took less time he could be giving you time for that too. Once the kids have more of their own hobbies he\u2019ll have more time for running again.", "You need to talk to him and organise time together and with the kids appropriately, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve actually had a sit down discussion about this. He ran before you woke up and then spent the day together/cleaning, so that\u2019s a non-issue and why couldn\u2019t you spend alone time on Saturday when he was with the kids? He needs alone time too, but chooses to do it running. YTA", "I've seen people do the 100's and it's not something I'd recommend to anyone who's only done marathons. It's brutal and as trail crew there's been multiple seasoned runners who you have to pull from the race and occasionally carry off trail. Particularly dangerous for those who don't do a lot of night trail running, but the whole thing is grueling. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I feel like a lot of the long races require you to have done a certain number of the next level down within a year-18 months? Like, if you want to do a 100 you must have completed 3 x 50 m or 50 k races within the last year and half?", "Why doesn\u2019t she wake up early or go to bed later then?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I think a 50 miler - or honestly a 50k if he\u2019s new to trail running - is a reasonable compromise.", "I was searching the thread for other ultrarunners! I agree that this training likely is not enough for a 100 miler. It\u2019s significantly less than what I did for my 50 miler. He could really get himself hurt. \n\nRunning is super important to my mental health and I make a point to fit it into my schedule. Still, in busier times, I recognize that sometimes I need to pause signing up for races and roll back the mileage a bit. I don\u2019t currently have kids but couldn\u2019t imagine signing up for a 100 miler right after having one. You\u2019re NTA.", "I really can\u2019t say you\u2019re an asshole, because I\u2019m a distance runner and I know there are times it can be tough on my partner. Although I don\u2019t think your husband is either. \n\nEmotionally, I always want him to support me during my races but logically I understand he doesn\u2019t always have the bandwidth to do so.  \n\nPerhaps as an alternative you could schedule a massage and some yummy takeout food for after the race? No work for you but you can show your support. Better yet schedule one for you too so you can celebrate together. \n\nAnd I really encourage you to pick up a hobby outside of your husband and your family. Even if it\u2019s as \u201csmall\u201d as reading. Just something that\u2019s completely yours.", "Running ultramarathons isn't really productive, it is quite self-absorbed."]}
