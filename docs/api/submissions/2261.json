He typically runs the Dopey Challenge at Disney World every couple years and now he's decided that after our January 2023 Disney trip, he's going to start training for a 100 mile ultramarathon. That means every other weekend he'll be running 20+ miles as well as shorter distances on the non-long run weekends. We recently had our second baby this past June and between running, work, and the masters program he started last November, I've been spending long hours with the kiddos (3 years and 4 months), especially on the weekends. It's wearing on me a ton, especially since I'm also a full-time working mom.\n\nMy husband is really looking for support and encouragement to meet his goal of running an ultramarathon. He wants his parents and I to be his crew during the 30 hour race in August, leaving our then 4 year old and 1 year old with friends for the weekend. We'd be driving from point to point overnight to get him food, supplies, bandage blisters, etc. \n\nI want to be supportive, but I feel like I'm sacrificing so much of my physical and emotional energy to support his personal goals. He also says I told him it was okay when he initially signed up, but now I complain about it all the time. \n\nSo, AITA for not being excited he's running the ultra?\n\nEdit: He does try to schedule runs for early in the morning when we're still asleep. He also does spend time with his kids changing diapers, playing, feeding them, etc. It's just that I don't get much time by myself without the kids. For example, he studied for and took a test on Saturday. I had the kids from when they woke up until about 12:45. I then took an hour nap and we had the kids together the rest of the day. Today, he ran before we woke up, we went out with the kids for a couple hours, and then he was on kid duty while I cleaned the house. Altogether, I probably had 2 hours by myself without kids present all weekend.", "created_utc": 1668389677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yul7gr/aita_for_not_cheering_on_my_ultramarathoner/", "score": 709, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Question is, would you be able to have a hobby that took up this amount of time, effort and energy ( and maybe finances) with his support?", "NTA. He gets more time without the kids, works on himself and his hobbies and you don't. No matter how early he wakes up to run, that doesn't sound fair at all especially since it's catching up on you. You should be able to use your kid free time to focus on yourself like he does, not cleaning the house. That's only possible with him putting more effort.", "NTA. His role as your partner should come before your role as his cheerleader, and with him not living up, how should you be expected to?", "NTA. It's great that he has goals and hobbies and whatnot, but he also has responsibilities as a father and partner. Especially while the kids are so young, his responsibility should be to his family. When they're older, he can spend more time focusing on his own pursuits. Right now, it sounds like he is trying to avoid them.", "NTA what time has he scheduled to be a parent? What time has he set aside to be a husband? What time has he set aside to help with household chores? I'm seeing a lot of he does this this and this for himself but I'm not seeing that he's putting his family first... Or even second, or 3rd.

If you said you were okay at the start then just complain that's not quite fair on him. You admit he's doing a lot of the running while you're asleep, he's going on outings with the kids, he's taking over the kids in the evening, etc. Sounds like he's doing quite a bit too really on top of schooling and training. I get him wanting you to be there for that day but if you can't tell him.

He can do a good job packing his drop bags, the race has loads of support from volunteers, & maybe he can find a pacer (if allowed) to run with him in final shit miles. The most he can expect from you, imo, is a huge congrats at the end & a ride home.\n\nAlso, he jumped right to 100 miler? That's unusual &, to me, foolhardy. I had a dozen 50Ks under my belt before tackling 50 milers. Only a few folks I know did the 100 & there were a LOT of DNFs, even with seasoned ultra runners.

Not enough time in the day!", "20 miles at a time!", "Why?", "If he is planning to run 20 miles on a weekend and run an ultramarathon, he would be taking far too long at 5hours.

He used the running to escape family responsibilities and run away from his obligations.  His wife was a SAHM (my friend).", "I'm not convinced he even realizes that he's being selfish. Like you say, people who do this definitely get sucked into it, almost like it's an addiction. It's super impressive but also extremely time consuming. A friend of mine just keeps getting more and more extreme with his runs - while also being a father (though with older kids than OP's). It's all he ever talks about anymore.  \n\nMaybe I'm a bit biased against it as I'm not a fan of running, even though I do it (much shorter distances) for exercise.", "Not that working long hours is ever worth sacrificing having a life, but out of interest, did the hard work pay off? Did he ever up with the financially secure future he told you he was working towards?", "The issue isn\u2019t how he is spending his free time, it\u2019s the fact that she doesn\u2019t get any.", "Who cares what shows other people are watching, OP is counting cleaning the house as her only childfree time", "if he was spending six hours gaming or binging tv shows while the only break she got was cleaning the house and taking a short nap that would also be a huge problem", "NTA this is AH behavior disguised as a nice guy hobby and I\u2019m not buying it.\n\nLife is about priorities.

Over time (especially after having children) things can shift a bit. Not deliberately, but the balance of chores, duties and free time can change. And you are too busy to notice or really think about it. \n\nAnd then you need to communicate effectively about those changes. And see how he responds.

I also appreciate how involved you are as a dad. But I'm also jealous of the time you get to spend on that personal development because there is no place in my schedule for that.

That isn't something thats your fault and I'm not blaming you for it, but I genuinely have no mental or emotional space to invest in your ultramarathon.

Its just hard for me not getting that time for myself.\"", ">Altogether, I probably had 2 hours by myself without kids present all weekend.\n\nThat's more than I ever had. I find that a lot. However I find it difficult to judge in total. It depends on how much total time this running takes up.

Long story short, he was using the running to avoid being home.

But the difference between a 50k and a 100 mile ultra is huge. \n\nFirst, your husband is foolish for not aiming for a 50k or 50 mile first. Second, your husband is an asshole for doing this when you have two young children - plus you\u2019re both working full time and he\u2019s doing a Masters. Third, he needs to find a different crew - ideally folks who have both running and crewing experience. Hell, he should both crew for someone and volunteer at an ultra before attempting one himself. It\u2019s really unfair to you!\n\nOne suggestion: can you each have a weekend day to yourself? In our family, I get Saturdays and my partner gets Sundays. We might not take the whole day to ourselves but we can if we want. I had to institute this when I felt like I wasn\u2019t getting enough time to myself. I also claim 60-90 minutes in the early mornings before he leaves for work, then he gets two weeknights.

You're also post-partum and I'm assuming bub still relies on you for feeding, so that should be taken into account.\n\nDon't work crew for him. You are already crew for your children.", "NTA - it does sound like your husband might not have his priorities straight though.

He's not simply running for his mental and physical health - he's after achieving a serious level of running and is happy to use all his family's resources to reach that.
