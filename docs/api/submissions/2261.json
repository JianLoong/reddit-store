{"id": 2261, "submission_id": "yul7gr", "title": "AITA for not cheering on my ultramarathoner husband?", "selftext": "Running is my husband's form of exercise, which he feels is becoming more and more necessary as he gets older. He typically runs the Dopey Challenge at Disney World every couple years and now he's decided that after our January 2023 Disney trip, he's going to start training for a 100 mile ultramarathon. That means every other weekend he'll be running 20+ miles as well as shorter distances on the non-long run weekends. We recently had our second baby this past June and between running, work, and the masters program he started last November, I've been spending long hours with the kiddos (3 years and 4 months), especially on the weekends. It's wearing on me a ton, especially since I'm also a full-time working mom.\n\nMy husband is really looking for support and encouragement to meet his goal of running an ultramarathon. He wants his parents and I to be his crew during the 30 hour race in August, leaving our then 4 year old and 1 year old with friends for the weekend. We'd be driving from point to point overnight to get him food, supplies, bandage blisters, etc. \n\nI want to be supportive, but I feel like I'm sacrificing so much of my physical and emotional energy to support his personal goals. He also says I told him it was okay when he initially signed up, but now I complain about it all the time. \n\nSo, AITA for not being excited he's running the ultra?\n\nEdit: He does try to schedule runs for early in the morning when we're still asleep. He also does spend time with his kids changing diapers, playing, feeding them, etc. It's just that I don't get much time by myself without the kids. For example, he studied for and took a test on Saturday. I had the kids from when they woke up until about 12:45. I then took an hour nap and we had the kids together the rest of the day. Today, he ran before we woke up, we went out with the kids for a couple hours, and then he was on kid duty while I cleaned the house. Altogether, I probably had 2 hours by myself without kids present all weekend.", "created_utc": 1668389677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yul7gr/aita_for_not_cheering_on_my_ultramarathoner/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s lovely that he has goals and dreams, but it isn\u2019t fair for him to expect his family to suffer in the name of supporting him. I hope he has a serious plan to make up for all the time he\u2019s been gone once this is over.", ">He wants his parents and I to be his crew during the 30 hour race in August, leaving our then 4 year old and 1 year old with friends for the weekend.\n\nI'm sorry but I think that's an unfair ask. I think you're burning yourself out for your kids and his needs. NTA.", "NTA. It sounds as if his hobby takes up a lot of time, effort and energy and makes him feel good about himself. Bravo. Question is, would you be able to have a hobby that took up this amount of time, effort and energy ( and maybe finances) with his support?", "NTA. He gets more time without the kids, works on himself and his hobbies and you don't. No matter how early he wakes up to run, that doesn't sound fair at all especially since it's catching up on you. You should be able to use your kid free time to focus on yourself like he does, not cleaning the house. That's only possible with him putting more effort.", "NTA. His role as your partner should come before your role as his cheerleader, and with him not living up, how should you be expected to?", "NTA. It's great that he has goals and hobbies and whatnot, but he also has responsibilities as a father and partner. Especially while the kids are so young, his responsibility should be to his family. When they're older, he can spend more time focusing on his own pursuits. Right now, it sounds like he is trying to avoid them.", "NTA what time has he scheduled to be a parent? What time has he set aside to be a husband? What time has he set aside to help with household chores? I'm seeing a lot of he does this this and this for himself but I'm not seeing that he's putting his family first... Or even second, or 3rd. Lol Honestly it sounds like he should be single, because running is more important to him than his family. I'm sorry!", "NTA\n\nIt's really tough going from one baby to two especially once baby Number 2 becomes mobile.  You're going to need more support from your spouse and he won't be able to give it to you because he's training.  If he could wait a couple of years that would be so much better for your mental health .", "NTA. When is he taking care of his kids and participating in his household, with such a significant training schedule? He\u2019s a selfish, small man who is literally running away from his babies. Tell him no, you aren\u2019t crewing for him. He certainly isn\u2019t for you.", "NTA dude needs to raise his kids", " NTA - I used to run (not as far as your hubby) but I did it with a treadmill, and when she was old enough, with her biking along with me. \n\nThere are lots of options for him to train or adjust his hobby to be more family-friendly (jogging strollers, treadmills). Is it the same? No, but oui make adjustments for your family.", "NTA. People should do this kind of time-intensive stuff before having kids, or when the kids are old enough that one parent\u2019s absence doesn\u2019t cause undue hardship for the other parent. My spouse does an annual weekend charity bike ride and I have not felt put-upon by that and the associated training even when our kids were little, but the monthlong cross-country ride was done before the kids were born.", "As a runner, I would hope my S/O is OK with the training time, but asking to be support crew might be a boundary that I wouldn't cross.", "NTA - I can relate. I had a girlfriend who was obsessed with running a marathon. She had previously been overweight so getting active and losing weight was very big to her. But like it was OBSESSIVE and basically as mentally unhealthy as her previous eating disorder. Like she had no free time, no social life and basically we just saw each other briefly in our place. I basically told her it seemed to me it was an unhealthy obsession and she already ran a lot so why keep going crazy with it. I can't imagine this while doing all the stuff with the kids too. Maybe have a talk with him about the toll it's taking on you.", "Info: how much time does he spend running per week? How much time do you get to spend on your hobbies per week?", "NTA. This is a lofty goal, and with your family situation the way it is, he should continue with marathons or maybe a bit more, but the ultra needs to be a goal for after he finishes school.", "YTA here for me sorry. If you said you were okay at the start then just complain that's not quite fair on him. You admit he's doing a lot of the running while you're asleep, he's going on outings with the kids, he's taking over the kids in the evening, etc. Sounds like he's doing quite a bit too really on top of schooling and training. I get him wanting you to be there for that day but if you can't tell him. The rest of the time why don't yall work on finding a baby sitter once or twice a week where you can both have some time off?", "It takes a really special woman to be the woman behind the man accomplishing great deeds.

Both while your kids are this young is just too much.", "ESH\n\nDoing this when your kids are so young isn't a great idea, especially if he is the only one getting alone time, it's going to make you resent him. It's natural for him to want you to be his cheerleader, but it's understandable that when you are exhausted it's the last thing  you want to do. He is asking too much. \n\nBut nagging him is not going to make the situation any better, and he will end up resenting you. As far your edit goes, he doesn't leave you holding the bag all of the time. He also gets up early to run, which shows an effort to mitigate how much time he leaves you alone with the kids.\n\nThe two of you have to have a serious conversation, in fact before talking you should both write out exactly what the issues are, and how you think they could be overcome. Work together to resolve the issues. Figure out how you get more time on your own, and how he can feel supported even if you don't want to be his crew.", "Sounds like he is literally running away.", "OP says he generally schedules his runs in the morning while they\u2019re asleep. Otherwise, he\u2019s working, taking care of the kids and having family time.", "I believe he runs 2-3 days per week during lunch. Every other weekend he'll have a longer run and the other weekends it'll be a short run. So, this weekend was something like 5-6 miles, which he ran this morning before we woke up. Next weekend is 20 miles and as far as I understand, you don't run as fast as you can when it's an ultra (since it's endurance, not speer) so if he's running a 15 minute mile (totally random number), that should take him around 5 hours. Add in his commute to and from where he likes to run (1 hour round trip), that's 6 hours.", "What about the great deeds OP might be interested in doing herself, but can't because of the amount of time her husband spends training? Does she get the same amount of free time to pursue her hobbies? It doesn't seem like it from the post.\n\nAlso I don't necessarily consider running an ultramarathon a \"great deed\" - sure, it's an impressive feat but it's not like he's curing cancer or something. It's just a race, albeit a ridiculously long one.", "And how much free time do you get? I\u2019m assuming basically none but you also need down time.", "Her great deed is spending time with him, according to this post. So, no. She can sit on the couch and be unproductive by herself if she likes.", ">She can sit on the couch and be unproductive by herself if she likes.\n\nAh yes, between the full-time job and taking care of a toddler and infant she *totally* has the time to sit on the couch and be unproductive.
