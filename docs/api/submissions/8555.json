That ended up being a good idea, since our table scraps would go to them instead of being wasted to the trash. For the record, I hate when my wife shops are Costco. She buys too much for our family which creates a lot of waste. I\u2019ve asked her to at least donate what we don\u2019t eat, or give it to me and I can drop it off to a homeless camp near my job.

She was completely mortified and grossed out. I told her I washed everything off before cooking it, but she said that didn\u2019t matter. My point was, if the food was good enough for us to eat it should have not been thrown out. At bare minimum, she could have given it to our daughter to take to the chickens. She argued back, that I should have taken it from the trash and to the chickens, not to our table. \n\nShe was irritated with me, fearing we all would have food poisoning or something.

But why in the fuck would you feed it to anyone else without their knowledge and consent, much less your own family??", "NTA. Everything was either sealed peeled or washed so there is literally no sanitation issue.", "Seems like the perfectly good food was carelessly thrown out. Who cares if it was in the trash as long as it was not contaminated. He said the package of lettuce was still sealed in its plastic. I'm assuming the other items were in a bag not thrown in rubbing against the side of the trash can. Even if they were, they can be thoroughly washed. Excessive waste is yet another example of why our society is doomed.", "Haven't ever used your local food pantry, huh? Very rarely is the food given 100% within date. \n\nSpouse shouldn't have thrown useful food away, and grabbing it from the trash didn't make it less useful.  If you think that food is arriving to your house \"clean\", I've got some sad news for you. \n\nIf it was buried under dirty diapers & baby wipes, then yeah, that would be totally gross.  But on top of general trash & (very likely) still in produce bags? Nothing wrong with that.\n\nI get that a lot of people will never, ever use something outside dates, and will automatically throw out any produce left at the end of the week. It is wasteful, and a luxury.", "(Smile) -- This reminds me of 'ugly' fruits and vegetables; ya know, the ones that are not perfect like a carrot with two 'legs'. Marketing has shaped people to expect perfection and marketing can separate us from common sense.", "100% agreed. I feel for what OP lived through, but my skin crawled when I was reading that the family was eating the trash can food. These are supposed to be people he loves and protects\u2014 there\u2019s no reason he should be putting them at risk like that.\n\nI hope he gets help, but I vote YTA for that.", "It's not the expiration date people are up in arms about.  It's the fact that he took the food out of trash can, swarming with bacteria and served it to his family without their knowledge or consent.", "Agreed. These types of foods usually have a \"best by\" date vs. an expiration date.", "To argue against the lettuce- in the last 2 years lettuce has been recalled for Ecoli contamination several times. I wouldn\u2019t chance the lettuce.", "Cucumbers can be peeled.", "OP said he washed everything", "Do you know how potatoes, lettuce, and cucumbers are grown? And that the USDA has allowable amounts of rodent hair in flour and mold and insect parts in just about everything we eat? https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/health/insect-rodent-filth-in-food-wellness/index.html\n\nThe trash can is the least of our worries.", "I agree with the last statement of your response, however, it doesn\u2019t detract from the fact the OP fed his wife and daughter expired food that was thrown away and thought it was perfectly fine, and you agree with that? And I would still like to know how not wanting to eat said disgusting food is entitled in any way", "Would you be okay with your spouse sneakily feeding you and your child expired wrapped food from the bin without letting you know until after you have eaten it?", "the expiration date doesn't have anything to do with ecoli\n\nif it looks good to eat it's fine", "and he didn't see any harmful bacteria on it - so it should be fine.", "While that list was horrifying, it's still nasty af to pick food out of a trash can and eat it. \n\nThink of it this way: even after knowing that all these things are legally allowed in your food, if you find a strand of hair, some mould, or an insect in your food, would you still eat it? The majority of people wouldn't. \n\nIt isn't practical for us to grow all of our own food so we kinda have to live with the fact that a lot of filth is legally allowed in food products. But that doesn't mean we throw all caution to the wind and stop caring about hygiene. \n\nAgain, if you want to do that with your own food, go ahead. BUT DON'T DO IT TO OTHER PEOPLE'S FOOD.", "A \"Best by\" date doesn't mean that the food is spoiled. It's merely an arbitrary date that after which, the manufacturer will not guarantee the quality of the product.  The wife and kids said the meal was good. Only after the wife learned the source of the food was she upset by it. Nothing in OP's post said the food was disgusting, you added that bit. Wasting the perfectly good food is what's entitled.", "NOT expired. BEST BY date. Learn a little. smh", "Obviously, yes. That is my whole point", "Please tell me.thats sarcasm.  You can't see all bacteria and germs.", "I see the point but the lettuce was wrapped and so was the bread. Cucumber and potatoes scrubbed and peeled. I sincerely doubt there was any contamination over and above what you'd get in the grocery store. My point was there is contamination everywhere. That's not license to make it worse of course. But it sounds as though OP was careful and what he served wasn't any more contaminated than anything else.\n\nI get that the idea of the trash can gets people and it's a one-way street for some but it also helps to have a realistic expectation of the lack of purity in our food. It's not a reason to be reckless but this is how and why our immune systems work. Sure, the wife was horrified and maybe OP went too far but I don't think the meal was unsafe. My ick factors lie elsewhere.", "I think you\u2019re misunderstanding me. I agree the wife is being wasteful, she should have donated it instead. But she threw it in the trash. Trash has bacteria. I know he \u201cwashed it off\u201d but it\u2019s still gross either way. Thanks for your perspective either way", "Hey, OP was the one that said expired in his own words.", "You want bacteria? [https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/health/insect-rodent-filth-in-food-wellness/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/health/insect-rodent-filth-in-food-wellness/index.html) Ever seen produce processing? If you're freaked out over the wrapped food sitting on top in the trash can and being thoroughly cleaned and cooked afterwards, seeing how the food you buy is treated, it'll curl your hair.", "Have you never bought bread, lettuce or potatoes? They don't have expiration dates, hell, not even milk does. So irrespective of what OP typed, maybe someone would make the mental leap? nah..."]}
