That ended up being a good idea, since our table scraps would go to them instead of being wasted to the trash. For the record, I hate when my wife shops are Costco. She buys too much for our family which creates a lot of waste. I\u2019ve asked her to at least donate what we don\u2019t eat, or give it to me and I can drop it off to a homeless camp near my job. She promised to just buy less quantity, but that didn\u2019t last because she doesn\u2019t like grocery shopping more than once a week. \n\nLast week I came home and found a sealed pack of lettuce, one whole cucumber, an entire loaf of bread, and potatoes in the trash can outside.

She was completely mortified and grossed out. I told her I washed everything off before cooking it, but she said that didn\u2019t matter. My point was, if the food was good enough for us to eat it should have not been thrown out. At bare minimum, she could have given it to our daughter to take to the chickens. She argued back, that I should have taken it from the trash and to the chickens, not to our table. \n\nShe was irritated with me, fearing we all would have food poisoning or something. But none of us got sick from the food. She said regardless, it was wrong for me to prove a point in that manner and borderline abuse to serve the family food from the trash.

Do you not wash yours after buying them? Do you know how many people probably touch them at the grocery store before you do?", "In future, could you not just remove the packaging from salad/vegetables whilst it\u2019s in the fridge so your wife can\u2019t see the best before dates?\n\nThis is what I used to do with my ex husband as he used to throw everything out when it was still edible.\n\nI have no issues going past the dates for salad/veggies etc, but I wouldn\u2019t mess around with meat.\n\nNot sure I\u2019d eat bread that had expired by 7 days either.", "Pretentious as well as an asshole. Do you usually try to parent your wife?", "I wish I had a gold for you - because this needs to be farther up!! Take my poor man\u2019s \ud83c\udfc5", "It was the outside trash can.", "Cooking doesn't even always make food safe.\n\nFor example, food infected with staph bacteria can still make you sick after being cooked because the toxins are resistant to heat (and that's the part that actually makes you sick with that disease)\n\nI wouldn't worry too heavily before it was in the trash, but you definitely should not be eating it once it came out of the trash.", "The Freegan movement is how I fed myself through college and I still hate food waste with a burning passion. So much so that I volunteer at our local food rescue that takes items exactly like OPs wife threw out (close to best before date, blemished, excess product or otherwise unsellable but still edible) from grocery stores and community members to redistribute them to the community because food waste is a massive problem in our society (not just for the garbage aspect but the amount of wasted resources it takes to grow and transport that food that\u2019s being thrown out).", "no you're worse bc you knowingly messed with your family to prove a sanctimonious point.", "You fed your family expired food. You're there.", "Maybe, I know it\u2019s a crazy idea, but maybe the OP has a job he has to work at. Maybe, this is also crazy, he doesn\u2019t have time to do the grocery AND cook. I know this is a crazy idea so take it with a grain of salt", "Thanks Norway!  Americans are so uneducated as to be unable to reason for themselves.   Most Americans can\u2019t evaluate risk from microbial contamination because they don\u2019t have the foundational knowledge to consider the risks reasonably.  It\u2019s a sad truth.", "I wouldn't have thrown away perfectly good food\n\nbread doesn't \"expire\" - it goes mouldy\n\nlettuce doesn't \"expire\" - it wilts/goes slimy\n\npotatoes don't \"expire\" - they rot\n\nthe wife is wasteful\n\nshe needs to stop buying so much that they're throwing away that much food.", "But it wasn't expired? It most likely the \"best by date\". Nothing was rotting or moldy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHeck, I've accidentally dropped potatoes in our trash can when peeling them over it. It just wash it off, keep peeling, and use them. Nothing wrong with it. There IS something wrong with food waste, however.", "Wait, I\u2019m sorry, food waste is a problem, but we\u2019re perfectly fine throwing cups away?", "NTA. Good for you saving food from being wasted.", "Agreed. I struggled growing up too, and also hate wasting food. And it sounds like maybe his wife jumped the gun on good food, but it\u2019s also a big mental labor to be in charge of buying the food and keeping track of what you have, what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not. This is where communication between partners comes in.", "Agree. NTA, but OP, definitely talk to your wife so you can come up with a compromise.", "You don\u2019t get the feeling from the post that he\u2019s smarter than that?", "Thank you.", "!!! This. I wish more people kept this in mind, rice is a huge one for this.", "general rule of thumb is don't fuck with people's food, especially to prove a point. hiding meat in a vegetarian or vegans food, testing food intolerance, etc. is not ok on any level and makes you an automatic AH. OP knew his wife wouldn't eat trash food and fed her trash food to prove a point. OP is unequivocally an AH", "op can always order online groceries and have it delivered if so busy", "If you are an efficient shopper, you can easily get in and out in 30 mins. Most stores even have a $/100g on their price label which makes getting your bang for your buck much faster. $0.17/100g for potatoes is much better than $0.60/100g for potatoes. Easy win for cheapest product. Get used to the store and you'll spend more time in line and paying than you will walking the isles", "I got that. I was responding to the date. Too many people think 'best by' means it magically rots the day after and that's just stupid.", "The bread was still packaged and vegetables are literally grown in a mixture of feces, blood, bone and chemicals.", "And either of those kind of dates are arbitrarily decided by the manufacturer.", "That's leaf lettuce. Iceberg or head lettuce does not have that problem. Just peal off the wilted leaves.", "That was not on expired lettuce. Lettuce doesn\u2019t expire, it wilts. And that was not from sitting around, from contaminated water", "If it had ecoli it would have it even if you ate it by the expiration date.", "If you drop a peeled banana on your floor you better throw it out then. Because that\u2019s probably about as \u201ctrash\u201d as some of the food OP took out of their bin", "I don\u2019t throw out perfectly good food, so I\u2019d immediately be able to visually identify that the rotting produce and moldy bread was old.", "To be fair, a lot of bacteria like e. Coli or staph doesn't always cause the food to look spoiled or taste/smell off. I learned this the hard way a couple of weeks ago.", "that's what I mean though - like you won't know at all - it has nothing to do with if it is expired or not\n\nif you are truly worried about ecoli then don't buy the lettuce or make sure to wash thoroughly\n\nby it's fine I mean that if it doesn't look wilted or bad it's not bad other than something that would have been there 5 days prior", "Yeah it's like the big hepatitis outbreak last year that was caused by imported frozen berries that looked and smelled completely fine!", "Ecoli isn\u2019t ON the food, it\u2019s IN it - you can\u2019t wash it off.", "TIL - my husband would be ashamed.
