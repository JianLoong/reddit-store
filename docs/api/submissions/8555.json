By the time I was 16, we were technically on our own and was ransacking dumpsters to feed myself and my sister. \n\nI\u2019m now in my late 30s, have a successful career and live quite comfortably, my sister is also well off now.

However, there\u2019s one issue we always can\u2019t find a compromise. \n\nI can\u2019t handle when food is thrown out. Our daughter (12) wanted chickens last year. That ended up being a good idea, since our table scraps would go to them instead of being wasted to the trash. For the record, I hate when my wife shops are Costco. She buys too much for our family which creates a lot of waste. I\u2019ve asked her to at least donate what we don\u2019t eat, or give it to me and I can drop it off to a homeless camp near my job. She promised to just buy less quantity, but that didn\u2019t last because she doesn\u2019t like grocery shopping more than once a week. \n\nLast week I came home and found a sealed pack of lettuce, one whole cucumber, an entire loaf of bread, and potatoes in the trash can outside. The lettuce was expired, but looked fine. The bread was also expired, but had no mold. The potatoes had eyes, but weren\u2019t green or rotten yet. I went inside and started on dinner. I grilled chicken, which was the only item not from the trash. I made a salad and added the cucumber, used the bread to make croutons. And finally, I made mashed potatoes. \n\nWe all sat down to eat, my wife mentioned how great the food was. I told her it was what she had thrown out earlier that day. She was completely mortified and grossed out. I told her I washed everything off before cooking it, but she said that didn\u2019t matter. My point was, if the food was good enough for us to eat it should have not been thrown out. At bare minimum, she could have given it to our daughter to take to the chickens. She argued back, that I should have taken it from the trash and to the chickens, not to our table. \n\nShe was irritated with me, fearing we all would have food poisoning or something. But none of us got sick from the food. She said regardless, it was wrong for me to prove a point in that manner and borderline abuse to serve the family food from the trash.

Get angry about that. But unless you want to go to a restaurant and get served other people\u2019s half eaten scraps, then you should probably understand who and what you\u2019re so angry about", "Who cares?  Is the inside of your house or is your indoor trash can magically protected by some force field? You are a germaphobe and that's a you problem not a true issue.", "Plus some people throw dog poop in other people's outside trash. Gross but it happens.", "Strangely, if it's in the fridge, she will throw it out the second it reaches the expiry date, however anything that can be frozen is treated as if it has an endless shelflife. The reason the freezer is so full is because she buys things on sale and buys too much, without a plan. My mother is both the OP and the husband.", "He still shouldn\u2019t had pulled it out of the garage, and served it, but I get it is wasteful.", "The outside trash, especially if you live in the South East USA, can be ripe for fly, cockroach, maggots, and other parasites/insects to feast on. Let alone raccoons, possum, feral cats/dogs, etc, which would\u2019ve made a distinct mess but a sick mind will justify eating or not eating anything. Trust me on that much.\n\nThis humidity cesspool instantly attracts disease carrying insects and pests, not to mention the ease and accessibility of something physically outdoors. Invasive pests can be bad indoors, but it\u2019s usually harder for them to get through barriers if you give a shit enough. \n\nBack to that trust me part, if I was a kid who already had eating issues that I hid from my parents, being served food picked from fly shit would\u2019ve given me a pretty good reason to be repulsed and despise food. \n\nUnless you have a sterilized trash can, eating food out of the same place that you dump bacteria laced waste is just repulsive.\n\nI mean I have a bathroom trashcan with some used tampons in it, want to take your chance at eating the whole potato that I threw on top of them?", "People put their dog shit in my outdoor trashcan... \n\nAvoiding food  contaminated with feaces and maggots makes you a germaphobe?", "Probably an american thing. We waste so much goddamn food it\u2019s disgusting", "exactly, im surprised by the verdict here.", "\"Sealed pack of lettuce\" is what OP stated.  \n\nAnd maybe you should do a better job of washing your produce, then.", "Veggies don't expire, they rot. You can very easily tell when a vegetable is bad", "It\u2019s his family not a restaurant they chose to eat his cooking he chose to use items they discarded that were not garbage but perfectly eatable as proven by the lack of mass GI distress\u2014 like make your own dinner then", " Heating food up or cooking it does not necessarily make it safe.", "It can look fine and still taste off. Could just be me though.", "Oh ,They definitely will make their dinner from now on after this incident. You make it seem like they can't cook for themselves or something. \n\nAlso ,they didn't know it come from the trash can . If they knew , they wouldn't choose to eat it .  He didn't provide them the information.", "According to OP she buys more because she only wants to do 1 shop a week she could cut that in less than half if OP did a midweek weekly shop too, why is it only on wife to meal plan and solo shop?, OP could be the one shopping (or at least helping) then wife wouldn\u2019t overshop because he could adjust what is brought in midweek according to what is only needed for the next few day until wife\u2019s next shop", "Bc it is irrelevant information. And a damn good way to make a point. Hey that salad was pretty tasty huh, nice crisp lettuce and fresh cucumber. So you threw all that out. So she thinks he\u2019s mentally incapacitated and can\u2019t tell the difference between eatable and noneatable food? Or that he\u2019s so spiteful he\u2019s give her food poisoning? I\u2019m just not sure how two marred people can be so conflicted on basic science. Did u speak to this person before you married them good grief", "The FAMILY should meal plan so that the member of the family who go grocery shopping only buy what's necessary for the week. Is that better phrasing for you ? I don't see the necessity to go buy groceries midweek. I only ever went once a week, unless I was craving something. When you plan your meals, you buy accordingly to what you need and dont end up wasting food", "It was related to the comment I replied to rather than the post as a whole.\n\n\nThat said, some (but not all) food-borne pathogens are capable of reproducing on food given the right conditions. A higher load of pathogens in the food means a higher chance of illness. \n\n\nLeaving food outside in a rubbish bin in the middle of summer can definitely give any pathogens the food may be tainted the chance they need to reach potentially dangerous population levels.", " Many of the food poisoning that people get from food has less to do with the bacteria that is on the food. When food makes it to the market, if people don't wash their hands, properly and for at least 30 seconds, after going to the bathroom, they then wind up transferring the bacteria from their hands to the food. Washing removes that kind of bacteria."]}
