What would she do with a list or guidance that's not a video game.\n\n\nLike, a 2 year old doesn't need a dictionary, but can you tell her specifically to buy Mo Willems books or something? Magic Tree House to read with your 6 year old? I don't know.\n\n\nOr tell her to just buy stickers and coloring books? \n\n\nSocks with favorite characters?\n\n\nDo your kids and your mom get along? Do they like spending time with grandma and would be upset if they don't get gifts?", "NTA cos you needed to be honest with her. Ask her for gift cards if she wants to keep trying, that way if they are for shops you don't visit, you can re-gift them.\n\nSide note - my kid used to try to read a kids dictionary when she was 2, you'd be surprised what some kids read :P", "NTA. This is truly thoughtless gifting, verging on offensive. \"It's the thought that counts\", sure, but that implies there was thought involved.", "NTA\nIt seems like she is just buying things to buy them no real thought into the gifts.", "NTA. Your mother sounds thoughtless in regard to gifts. Is she like this either every such occasion? Christmas,  birthdays,  etc?", "NTA - This honestly sounds like you're somehow your mothers dumpster. \"Look what I found in the basement!\"", "NTA\n\n\nBut if you think she\u2019s going to continue to disregard your request, have you tried making an Amazon wishlist for her? You can fill it up with 10-20 different things per person so she still gets the fun of \u2018picking\u2019 something out but you know it\u2019s something you\u2019ll actually enjoy/use. \n\nThe other route I\u2019d go is as baby gets older I\u2019d ask for her to gift experiences. Zoo & aquarium family passes, survival swimming lessons, MyGym membership, Disney on Ice, etc. A lot of these could be for the whole family including grandma.", "NTA \nYou and I must have the same mother. This year's gift, that was meant for me, was a ceiling  fan(??) that screwed straight into a light socket in the ceiling (like are often in garages or closets).

Mine once  bought my (then) 8 year old a book of annotated nursery rhymes (think foot notes), a single sheet of butterfly stickers and a free brochure from a museum.\n\nI like the suggestion of just regifting them to her, because I highly doubt she going to change even if you explicitly tell her to stop.\n\nAnother option may be that you want to do more experiences, so like gift certs to mini golf, movies etc.", "Gift cards or nothing at all.", "NTA my cousins used to get nice gifts from us but give me $2 earrings so mum started to regift my gifts to their daughter and would buy $2 store stuff for their sons so we all would get the same quality of gift. After a few years of this and my uncles wife decided we wouldnt exchange gifts. I say use the gifts she used them as easter, mothers day, birthday and xmas next year and see what she thinks of the gifts xD", "NTA! Slim fast? Really?
