What would she do with a list or guidance that's not a video game.\n\n\nLike, a 2 year old doesn't need a dictionary, but can you tell her specifically to buy Mo Willems books or something? Magic Tree House to read with your 6 year old? I don't know.\n\n\nOr tell her to just buy stickers and coloring books? \n\n\nSocks with favorite characters?\n\n\nDo your kids and your mom get along? Do they like spending time with grandma and would be upset if they don't get gifts?", "NTA cos you needed to be honest with her. Ask her for gift cards if she wants to keep trying, that way if they are for shops you don't visit, you can re-gift them.\n\nSide note - my kid used to try to read a kids dictionary when she was 2, you'd be surprised what some kids read :P", "NTA. This is truly thoughtless gifting, verging on offensive. \"It's the thought that counts\", sure, but that implies there was thought involved.", "NTA\nIt seems like she is just buying things to buy them no real thought into the gifts.", "NTA. Your mother sounds thoughtless in regard to gifts. Is she like this either every such occasion? Christmas,  birthdays,  etc?", "NTA - This honestly sounds like you're somehow your mothers dumpster. \"Look what I found in the basement!\"", "NTA\n\n\nBut if you think she\u2019s going to continue to disregard your request, have you tried making an Amazon wishlist for her? You can fill it up with 10-20 different things per person so she still gets the fun of \u2018picking\u2019 something out but you know it\u2019s something you\u2019ll actually enjoy/use. \n\nThe other route I\u2019d go is as baby gets older I\u2019d ask for her to gift experiences. Zoo & aquarium family passes, survival swimming lessons, MyGym membership, Disney on Ice, etc. A lot of these could be for the whole family including grandma.", "NTA \nYou and I must have the same mother. This year's gift, that was meant for me, was a ceiling  fan(??) that screwed straight into a light socket in the ceiling (like are often in garages or closets).

They obviously put the gifts in the cupboard and forgot that I originally gave those gifts. This has happened twice now. Starting to rethink giving gifts!", "If you have a regifting cupboard then you also have to have a spreadsheet/notebook with who gave you which gift so you don't make this mistake", "NTA, maybe it\u2019s time to switch to a white elephant/dirty Santa style gift exchange for family Christmas? Bad gifts are funny when it becomes part of the game to steal and pass around the gifts, and you no longer have to be grateful for whatever terrible thing she dreams up. For the kids though, it sounds like the simple answer is to put more items on their wish list that are in her price range or expertise. If you know she won\u2019t buy them a video game, maybe you buy that and leave a couple more traditional toys waiting to be bought.", "OOF! Slim powder for a 14yo?? And I'm cringing hard at the African statue ... NTA", "ESH.\n\nTerrible gifts are terrible gifts but there is absolutely a midway point for a 4 and 6 year old that isn't video games. If they were teenagers fair enough but a 4 and 6 year old are babies still. Hsve you really removed all toys and books from them?", "INFO: If she wants to get you something would it be possible to make a wish list?\n\nNTA, but I would talk about this calmly with your mother at a time that is not designated to gifts. Maybe sit her down in a couple of weeks or so and tell her what you told us. Without accusation or judgement.\n\nTalk with her about how you want to proceed from that point. \n\nIf mum is coming from a kind but hare-brained place then calm communication and solving this together is the way to go forwards peacefully.", "NTA\n\nOne thing you could do is remind her that your house is tiny and your kids are growing so you have really no space to show off new gifts properly. And ask her instead to get to get you foodie gifts: sweets, chocolates, biscuits, shortbread, wine, fruit in brandy etc. The great thing about consumable gifts is that if they're nice, you eat or drink them, enjoy them,  and they're gone; if they're not very nice you can throw them out and lie through your teeth about how much you liked them. The gift giver is happy, and, very importantly, you can keep your space the way you like it without adding clutter.", "Totally NTA\n\nUsually I'd say it's the thought that counts but I'd absolutely be saying the same.\n\nYou had my NTA vote at the sheer awfulness of giving anyone, let alone a 14 y o a slimming drink at all let alone as a present\ud83d\ude2f\n\nShe hasn't improved since, has she? I'd regift them to her at birthdays, mother's day, next Christmas without ANY shame if she doesn't take notice.", "I\u2019m honestly not sure what I want my verdict to be. On one hand, yes, it doesn\u2019t feel great to receive gifts that you don\u2019t like or want, and I know that feeling all too well. On the other hand, (from my own experience) my dad, despite loving to give people gifts, is just an absolutely terrible gift-giver. He really does try to be thoughtful, but he just never hits the mark. Sometimes he\u2019s even miles from the mark. I have received many gifts from him where my thought was \u201cI will never use or want this,\u201d but after I think about it and try to put myself in his shoes, I can understand where he was coming from when he chose it and why he would think I would like it. I\u2019ve never told him that I didn\u2019t like the gifts he gave me just because I know his heart was in the right place.\n\nINFO: Outside of gift-giving, does your mother tend to be a thoughtless, petty person? If the answer is no, if you put yourself in your mother\u2019s shoes, thinking about what she knows about you and your family and who she is as a person, is it possible for you to reach a train of thought where you can understand how she would think her gifts are something y\u2019all would like?", "I was also going to suggest outings. I now have teens (and toddlers) and when people ask what they want I tell them a gift certificate to someplace they can go together (the child and the gift giver). My kids are not going to remember in two weeks that grandma gave this item to them. But they will remember the times that grandma took them to the zoo or McDonald\u2019s.", "I was about to say the same thing. OP is Def NTA but I wonder if a wish list would help.. I do one every year now off Amazon for some family members, and it's worked out so far.", "Another option would be to do what my grandpa had his kids do when my cousins and I were children: set a budget for each kid and have the parents shop on his behalf (this was before the time of Amazon wishlists). That way he didn't have to remember the constantly changing interests, clothing sizes, or favorite colors of his 10 grandkids and wasn't that much more effort for a parent to get one more gift to be from him when they were already shopping.", "Yes exactly what I do as well. And mum does not sound malicious going by OP's description. Hence I would try to solve this peacefully before escalation.\n\nI would attempt that at a time where no gifts are involved to reduce emotional investment though."]}
