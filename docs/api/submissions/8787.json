Not because her family is homeless or anything.  They just earn less than we do.  Like in November she asked if we could give her brother $500.  He wanted to get his kids a PS5 for Christmas.  \n\nI think that was the last straw.  I told her that we could but it would be the last time that I contributed money to give away to people who just asked her for it.  \n\nDecember went fine but then in January one of her friends had car problems and needed to rent a car to run errands and drive her kids around.  My wife gave her money.  When she told me about it I said I was proud of her for sticking to our agreement that any money she decided to give away would come from her fun money and not ours.  \n\nShe looked really sour and asked if I was really not going to help her pay for her spa day with her friends.  I said yes because I had spent my money on a new drone already.  She asked if we could take money from our savings account to pay.  I said no because that is for emergencies and household expenses.  \n\nShe is mad at me for not helping her friend.  I pointed out that she could have kept her money and driven her friend around on errands and to pick up her kids.

I would try to structure it so that any personal expenses can only be paid for from the personal accounts.\n\nSo you have four types of accounts:\n\n1. Long term savings account: This automatically gets 15% of each paycheck\n2. Joint savings: This is where the rest of the paycheck goes\n3. Joint checking: You move money from joint savings here as-needed to pay for joint bills. Adding an extra step helps prevent this from being used for personal spending.\n4. Personal: You move money here from joint savings regularly, and split between yourself and your wife.\n\nYou quite probably already do this, but if not I recommend it. It makes it easy to keep personal spending and joint spending separate.\n\nI also recommend going over the charges to the joint account once a month.

At least when I was a child, beer imports exceeded the GDP (yes, really), so you can guess where most of the money she shared ended up.  \n\nI'd have more sympathy for the wife if she stuck to helping people in need, but yeah, nobody *needs* a PS5. She wants to help others, great!  But yeah, that comes at the cost of a spa day.  NTA.", "In November they gave her brother $500 to buy a PS5 for his kids. That\u2019s a want, not a need. Meanwhile, OP who can afford it is still playing a PS4 with his kids. Brother is living above his means and I doubt will be in a position to help them should anything hit the fan.", "Ok, but then she can be the one to prepare for that reality, no? It\u2019s her friends and family that she\u2019s trying to foster that good will with. OP isn\u2019t saying DONT, he\u2019s just saying if you do, it\u2019s YOUR choice.", "I mean, mutual aid is literally the human condition and the reason poor people stay poor is capitalism, but otherwise great post.", "I have to disagree about the wife here. She's not  \"planning on the unexpected\", she's being the big spender. To assume people you have helped will help you when you need is a betting game. If she wants to do that, fine, but she can use her fun money to do that, it's not her husband's responsibility to give up his fun money for her to throw her bling around.", "All points valid, but giving money to give kids a PS5 is not helping at all, it sounds like enabling. I agree with everything in your post though.", "I think you have an overly charitable view of OPs wife though\n\nI don\u2019t contest that this favor economy exists, but it really does seem like OPs wife likes being a big shot - or at the very least helping others when it requires absolutely no financial sacrifice of her own\n\nI\u2019m almost certain someone who\u2019s aghast that their husband won\u2019t dip into their savings to pay for her spa day isn\u2019t someone that is preparing for a rainy day", "She's giving away money to prepare for a future where they're broke and need to rely on favours from friends? Hell of a reach, hope you didn't strain anything. Guess if you did OP's wife could give you a recommendation for a good massage.", "Thanks for this comment. I never considered that. I think like most of these stories, there\u2019s a stunning lack of clear communication with a side of poor financial management.", "This really resonates with me thank you for expressing it so clearly and compassionately.", "I think you\u2019re making a lot of assumptions. I appreciate your thought process but do you really think OP\u2019s wife is planning for the unexpected where shit hits the fan and they need to rely on the community?", "Also it sounds like his fun money goes to dinners for both of them, that should be family fun money, right?", "Buying someone a PS5 is nowhere near the same thing as saving for retirement. That's ridiculous.", "No she stays home and takes care of HIS kids his house and performs in the bedroom for him. She has a much harder job than him and without her he would be paying a housekeeper, day care, prostitute or girlfriend for dates, take out or a chef. That woman\u2019s job is taking care of him. It\u2019s worth 6 figures easily.", "A spa day and a PS5 for the poorer family members for Christmas sort of knocks that first comment out of the realm of reality.", "The post you're responding to is so hilarious because it is **entirely** assumed. They just assumed this intentions of OPs wife based on... Nothing lol. Just made up some background that could justify it spun from thin air.", "Yeah can\u2019t believe that comment has so many upvotes and an award. It\u2019s seriously just based on a ton of assumptions about Ops wife\u2019s thought process. Like how? What information was given to assume any of that.", "I feel like you think you\u2019re disagreeing with me, but I think you\u2019re spot on. And the thing that sucks the most about what we\u2019re both talking about is that it means that the people who get out and wind up talking to the media about poverty are selfish people with nothing but contempt and patronization for their communities.", "I agree. Before they split what's left over, they should have a \"date\" budget/allowance, and THEN split. So they are taking EACH OTHER out. I think OP is being very fair here. \n\nAlso, NTA!", "I one hundred percent agree. Rich people do suck. However, having a little bit of extra money does not equal rich. And no one is entitled to the money that you earn. Giving a good Christmas does not mean forking over 500+ dollars for a gaming console. Christmas is not only about gifts as well. Or the amount the gifts cost. Once or twice makes sense. But it sounds like his wife does this frequently, therefore it is not OK.", "Being a stay at home mom is definitely a thankless job. And he does give her money. She just doesn't want to use her money to help out her family. Why should she take from the allotted amount that's not for her?", "Also, ew on the insinuation that she needs to perform for him in bed. That's just fucking creepy", "this is the correct approach.  If wife doesn't want to fund these handouts herself through her fun money, then she has to discuss first with  husband so it's a joint decision.  Giving your brother money to buy a PS5 when we don't even have a PS5?  No, he should go sign up for overtime or take a temp job on the weekends to get those funds.   Helping your friend get around - no, you can drive her around on some errands to help her, but getting a rental car is on her.  One spouse cannot unilaterally decide to do these things and then expect the other spouse to chip in.", "But your parents presumably didn't ask, your uncle just bought them for you to be a cool, good uncle. Big difference.", "Classic case of \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is mine, and what\u2019s ours is mine\u201d.  It\u2019s an individual\u2019s discretionary budget for a reason.  I\u2019m also curious about the need to state \u201cmy wife has the much tougher job\u201d. Does OP really believe that or is that mental gymnastics of some sort.  Not bothered either way, just curious as it influences the power dynamic.", "Then she should be a working mom if she wants to make those decisions about money only OP is earning for the household.", "I'm really curious what you thought the SAH stands for if you think the P is for pimp, because Stay At Home Pimp just doesn't sit right", "Parent", "It\u2019s extra savings why not use that?", "Is it? You a man think a wife owes it to you?", "My guess is he expected Y T A votes because this sub goes hard in defense of SAHMs (as they should) and wanted to be sure we saw he does appreciate the work she does.", "The concept is nice but the actual practice typically works out very differently. The one always asking for favors will almost never be in a position to really help out leaving the one providing the help completely SoL when they need help. Which means they either sink or ask a third party for help. Meanwhile original person needing help moves on to someone else who can still provide. The smarter ones distribute their requests around so that no one is fully drained and hope the givers don't talk to each other about the total amounts being given. Lastly, the original asker is rarely in a position to provide any help anyways as they have created such a mess they are relying on the help to continuously barely stay afloat.", "Is it fun budgets all the way down?", "It\u2019s not like she\u2019s not related to her nephew, what\u2019s wrong with wanting to help buy a kid she loves a nice gift? And any parent with a tight budget might want to ask for help like that if they knew their sister could afford it. A birthday isn\u2019t an emergency but it\u2019s pretty reasonable for family to buy a kid a gift. Granted $500 is a lot but I split the cost of two Switches and some games for my nephews for Christmas a couple years ago with my brother (and I\u2019m far from wealthy). It\u2019s not a reasonable monthly expense or anything but for a special occasion it seems reasonable to me.", "Um, she IS a working mom.  Even dad acknowledged she has the tougher job.  Yes, I get what you mean as in earn her money through a \u2018real\u2019 employer.  SMH", "Nope, terrible take. A SAHP is working and providing labor to the household, reducing major expenses like childcare. She's wrong for trying to have her cake and eat it too in regards to her fun money, but you're wrong in thinking OP should unilaterally decide household money because he's the only one directly earning money without considering that her labor is what allows him to do that.", "My thoughts exactly!", "They don't, that's the whole point. Yet she's still paying for it", "You don't normally GIVE the newest consoles without HAVING the newest consoles first. My husband and I had the PS5 AND  XBox Series X before we got our kids their own PS4 and Xbox Series S for Christmas this year.", "Ah ok cool. Thanks for the insight!", "But why does the gift need to be a 500 $ console when a previous model console is also available for cheaper.", "But she wants to give that money away without sacrificing her luxuries like spa days", "You can shake your head all you want, but she\u2019s the one asking to dip into savings he earns for all of them, so that she can give more money away to people they are not responsible for. If she wants to do that she can get job that generates income and then be truly charitable and not just charitable with Her husbands time and money.", "I never said OP should be making those decisions unilaterally. I said if she wants to continue doing so she needs to earn the money herself. Obviously the issue is OP has previously agreed to Her requests and now that they\u2019re setting a boundary the wife is upset. This is a 2 yes 1 no situation when it comes to the money OP earns for the family. If she wants the freedom to donate money without his input and not cut back on her personal spending she needs to bring in money on her own to accomplish that.", "I don't know where it comes from but based on my life experience I get the feeling OP's wife maybe grew up poor. I also grew up poor. Now that I'm older and wiser and not poor, I still like to help people that are struggling. For a long time it was a battle that about drove me back to the poor house. when I was in OP's shoes, my daughters mother was working part time and mostly staying home with our daughter. Unfortunately, she felt the need to help her friends and family with money more than I ever thought of. To the point that it put our family in monthly binds so she could feel good about giving money to her brother, who through his entire life has never held a job simply due to laziness, or to her drug addict uncle, or to whoever.\n\nMy little bro is still not financially stable and he is the same way. He'll put himself and his kids out just to give money to his friends when they ask.\n\nJust seems like it's common for people who grew up struggling to want to go overboard with helping others with money.", "I got it.", "A joke should say \u201cjk\u201d after it because there\u2019s lots of trolls on here that would seriously say something like that.", "Sorry. Guess I haven't learned Reddit rules yet. I do use the /s sometimes. But I was quoting here. And even tho it was sort of a joke, a massage really can help!"]}
