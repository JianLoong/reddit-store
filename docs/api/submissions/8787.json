I told her that we could but it would be the last time that I contributed money to give away to people who just asked her for it.  \n\nDecember went fine but then in January one of her friends had car problems and needed to rent a car to run errands and drive her kids around.  My wife gave her money.  When she told me about it I said I was proud of her for sticking to our agreement that any money she decided to give away would come from her fun money and not ours.  \n\nShe looked really sour and asked if I was really not going to help her pay for her spa day with her friends.  I said yes because I had spent my money on a new drone already.  She asked if we could take money from our savings account to pay.  I said no because that is for emergencies and household expenses.  \n\nShe is mad at me for not helping her friend.  I pointed out that she could have kept her money and driven her friend around on errands and to pick up her kids.

I would try to structure it so that any personal expenses can only be paid for from the personal accounts.\n\nSo you have four types of accounts:\n\n1. Long term savings account: This automatically gets 15% of each paycheck\n2. Joint savings: This is where the rest of the paycheck goes\n3. Joint checking: You move money from joint savings here as-needed to pay for joint bills. Adding an extra step helps prevent this from being used for personal spending.\n4. Personal: You move money here from joint savings regularly, and split between yourself and your wife.\n\nYou quite probably already do this, but if not I recommend it. It makes it easy to keep personal spending and joint spending separate.\n\nI also recommend going over the charges to the joint account once a month. This is helpful for keeping track of expenses (\"wow, out grocery bills have shot up!\").

They estimate maybe 10% of actual expenses and discount any discretionary spending you might want and they are confused why they don't have decision making on 300% of what's actually available for spending.  Then they are mad at you because in reality life is expensive and the money just goes.\n\nYour wife seems to suffer from this to a degree.  She's used to a reality where her money is her money and your money is her money if she gets rid of her money.\n\nNow she's trying to use emotional manipulation to get you to give up your stance not due to logic or having a moral argument, but just because she thinks withholding affection and humane treatment will get you to change your mind.\n\nDon't fall for the manipulation and call it out.", "NTA", "NTA.
