My wife has the much tougher job of being a stay at home mom and wrangling our offspring.  She works hard to make sure we have everything we need.  \n\nOur budget is pretty simple.  We put away about 15% of my earnings every month.  Then we pay all the bills.  Whatever is left we split and we can use it however we want.  \n\nI like to use mine to work on my hobbies or treat us to a night out.  I pay for the babysitter and whatever activity we do that night.  She uses hers to go to a spa or to buy herself pretty things that make her happy.  \n\nEvery once in a while she will ask if we can send money to her family.  Not because her family is homeless or anything.  They just earn less than we do.  Like in November she asked if we could give her brother $500.  He wanted to get his kids a PS5 for Christmas.  \n\nI think that was the last straw.  I told her that we could but it would be the last time that I contributed money to give away to people who just asked her for it.  \n\nDecember went fine but then in January one of her friends had car problems and needed to rent a car to run errands and drive her kids around.  My wife gave her money.  When she told me about it I said I was proud of her for sticking to our agreement that any money she decided to give away would come from her fun money and not ours.  \n\nShe looked really sour and asked if I was really not going to help her pay for her spa day with her friends.  I said yes because I had spent my money on a new drone already.  She asked if we could take money from our savings account to pay.  I said no because that is for emergencies and household expenses.  \n\nShe is mad at me for not helping her friend.  I pointed out that she could have kept her money and driven her friend around on errands and to pick up her kids.  She said I was being a jerk and slammed the door.  \n\nFor the record my kids and I are still playing games on our PS4 and switch.  She gives away our money to be a big shot.

Let her. \n\nHowever, this will snowball if you guys keep the bad communication going. You issuing an ultimatum and her throwing tantrums aren't solving the problem.

She is welcome to play benevolent benefactor with her own discretionary funds.", "NTA.  You aren't using her money to help out friends and family. She is.  If she wants to give away her money that is fine but she shouldn't allocate your personal budget to try and look good.", "NTA. I thought you did it as well and was gonna be like no sir not okay. Title isn't quite right. You have your own fun/extra money to use how you see fit. If she's sending hers to other people it's going to come at the expense of other \"fun\" stuff on her side. That makes sense.", "NTA - the people in her life have to stop relying on her as an ATM.  SHE has to stop being an ATM.", "NTA.  This one is pretty cut and dry.  It\u2019s not your family\u2019s job to fund friends and family.  You\u2019re right, if wife wants to do that, it\u2019s out of her account.  That\u2019s how it works in our house too.

The fact of life is all people have responsibilities that they should figure out how to pay for.  You and your wife are not a bank.  It sounds like she has let people rely on her to supply them money for too long.  If she wants to give away her money, I guess that's her prerogative, but then she shouldn't expect you to give her more to compensate for a decision she made.", "Wow that title is misleading. I'm tempted to call OP the AH for that.\n\nBut as it stands, NTA.\n\nWife is spending money with no input from her partner - that's fine, but she should only be doing that with her own money. She does not get to unilaterally decide what to do with the family's money, that needs a conversation and agreement first (unless a genuine emergency, of course). If she's upset with the way she spent her money, she has the ability to control that, OP is not interfering.", "NTA. Change your title, because it is very misleading.", "NTA.

Is she going to be expected to give them money to buy games for the PS5 as well because they're ridiculously expensive.  \n\nAnd just for the record, I'm still playing games on a PS3.", "NTA but you also probably need to have a closer conversation with your wife about finances.\n\nYou might be able to reduce tension by splitting up the accounts better. I would try to structure it so that any personal expenses can only be paid for from the personal accounts.\n\nSo you have four types of accounts:\n\n1. Long term savings account: This automatically gets 15% of each paycheck\n2. Joint savings: This is where the rest of the paycheck goes\n3. Joint checking: You move money from joint savings here as-needed to pay for joint bills. Adding an extra step helps prevent this from being used for personal spending.\n4. Personal: You move money here from joint savings regularly, and split between yourself and your wife.\n\nYou quite probably already do this, but if not I recommend it. It makes it easy to keep personal spending and joint spending separate.\n\nI also recommend going over the charges to the joint account once a month. This is helpful for keeping track of expenses (\"wow, out grocery bills have shot up!\"). It additionally means that if anyone tries to use the joint card for a personal expense it is very visible.", "NTA if she wants to give money away like that then it should come from her fun money.

First the title and the start with \u201ci am the breadwinner\u201d i was like : YTA, But it appears that your wife took that decision - not you. \n\nBtw whatever arrangement you have with stay at Home vs working is really irrelevant in this story. Whoever brings most and/or all the bacon has nothing to do with this. \n\nI Think that you should not spread around your money like that, because people Will start taking advantage over your wife when they realize you are some kind of charity. If your wife wants to do that- do it with her fun-money and she Can essentially Trade her spa day for free stuff to your friends and family. She Will get tired of that eventually.\n\nNTA", "ESH\n\nYour wife should stick to the agreement.  If she wants to help people out sometimes that means making sacrifices and giving up spa days.\n\nYou are an AH because you think that your wife's only reason to help friends/family is to be a big shot. Couldn't be that she actually wants to help people she cares about?", "Clearly nta", "NTA if she wants to give money to her friends and family it needs to come out of her money.

She can\u2019t have it both ways", "NTA\n\nI say this as a woman in a relationship that has EXACTLY the same budgetary principals.

I smoke cigarettes, but he can\u2019t complain if that is where my fun money goes.\n\nI have personally used my fun money to buy cloth to make commissioned outfits for friends and have ended up having to decide whether to write it off.

No you do not want to help her friend because that's not your responsibility and neither are her family. \n\nShe only wants to help when it's coming from your money we'll now she needs to choose to help others or treat herself.

We have guidelines for how much we're willing to support our familes with an agreement, we have budgets for how much we can spend on gifts, and anything else comes from what we're willing to spend out of our fun money.
