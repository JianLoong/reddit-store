I've been there.  I had a \"good\" job, people who depended on my work to get theirs done. I was always the guy who stepped up, even when I didn't want to, even when it wasn't fair that I kept having to. \n\nFast forward a few years. I'm now on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I haven't had more than a few hours of sleep at a time in weeks because I kept getting woken up by on-call pages. I was denied a promotion. And then, knowing I had sold my car, they demanded that I uber into the office several days a week at a cumulative cost of about 20% of my salary over the year. Everything crashed at once. In the span of a few hours, I went from overly stressed to suicidal, and demanded to be taken to the hospital before I did something stupid. I was put out on medical disability for a full six months, and was fired with a bullshit excuse almost as soon as my FMLA time ran out. I spent the first several weeks of disability just... laying there in bed, existing (except for when I was freaking out due to thoroughly debilitating panic attacks). Barely taking care of bodily functions, barely eating, not showering, sleeping 18 hours a day. An empty shell of myself. After a few weeks, the panic attacks had calmed down slightly, but I still couldn't drive or I would end up crashing. I started to move around a bit again, but with no interest in anything. I'd sit at my computer and watch youtube or scroll reddit just to kill time until it was time to sleep again. \n\nIt took me *months* to recover. Even by the end of my 6-month disability period, I wasn't at 100%. \n\nThe reason I'm saying that is because it's important for you to know the potential consequences of pushing yourself too far for a business that doesn't care about you enough to make sure you don't have to push yourself that far. \n\nGive not *one single flying fuck* what your manager says. She'd fire you in an instant if it made sense to do so. And she is not some gracious job-give benevolently bestowing upon you a way to support yourself. Your labor is a commodity that she is buying and the price is no longer worth it for you. If she wanted you to stay, she'd create working conditions that incentivize people to stay. \n\nDo what you need to do, for you, and don't feel bad about it for an instant.", "NTA.  If they \"cared about and loved you\" you wouldn't be in a situation where you need Xanax and a final day of work just to manage to come in.", "NTA - Healthcare is a hard field, thank you for doing what you do to support patients, just incase nobody has told you that lately. I\u2019ve worked in healthcare for almost 20 years, I know exactly what you are talking about, the system is so broken in the US (maybe other places too, but the US has the lowest patient satisfaction ratings and positive patient outcomes compare to similar counties, though the study I read that in is probably outdated since I did the research for a secondary degree 10 years ago). I was in a similar situation at my last job, I stuck it out for way too long and regret the time I spent there. My current job is a unicorn of a health facility, they care about patients and employees. It\u2019s not perfect, no place is, but I feel like I am listened to and that patient care matters. I hope your new job is like that as well. Do not feel bad for leaving, no matter if that is today, tomorrow or next week. You didn\u2019t cause the organizational problems that have led to a hostile and chaotic environment, you staying won\u2019t fix it.
