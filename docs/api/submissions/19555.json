My family works in a similar field.  I think the problem you are having is that maybe you felt pressured to do the job and because you are not being paid for it, it is not a priority for you, at least that is what I am getting out of it.  That is understandable.    \n\n\nWhat we do in our business is offer a discounted rate for family/ friends and we still do a timetable for deadlines.  It really makes a difference, the comments that your 'client' is making are unprofessional but to be fair you didn't establish a professional agreement.  I think at this point you and the client need to set up a mutually acceptable timeline, maybe in the future this can serve as a basis for how you would handle future requests from family members.    \n\n\nGood luck and I am sorry to hear of your loss.", "I can't decide if this is NAH or mild ESH.\n\nThis is a miscommunication, IMO.  You took her literally when she said 'there's no deadline' and projected that to mean ever.  I think most people would understand 'take your time' doesn't mean 'It's okay if I don't get this for months.'  After a few months, its reasonable she would be asking about it. She might be mild esh for her sarcasm, though I understand her frustration.\n\nYou might be mild esh because this delay is beyond 'not prioritizing' it, IMO.

She updated her EVERY WEEK by video call and she communicated with her by text message that she wasn't able to do an update because one of her animal patients died, from the animal sanctuary she's running with her *partner*. The reaction of her *partner*'s mother is extremely entitled and would suit r/ChoosingBeggars.", "The partner's mother got weekly updates, so she should be fully aware of the status of the project she isn't paying for. And she got a text message about why OP wasn't available for a video call update this week. So OP didn't leave her hanging and she can definitely wait a week.", "A full refund of what? Of the zero pounds she received for the unpaid project she is doing for her partner's mother in her spare time?\n\nedit: spelling", "You have really high standards. I don't think weekly updates by video call is \"dragging your feet\". I think that's very generous regarding it's an unpaid project she doing in her spare time.", "she's not a client tho, she's OP's partner's mother, and if she had expectations when it comes to having OP do work for her for free it was on her to communicate that, but honestly having expectations as high as hers seem to be when she's not even paying OP is very telling of her character.", "With everything you've done already and the regular updates, just reply saying you haven't had the chance this week.", "Yes exactly, that's my point.", "It's an unpaid project for 19 images to be individually drawn in photoshop, a job that takes multiple hours per image. Partner's mother knows OP has a fulltime job and runs an animal sanctuary with her partner, so she was fully aware OP could only work on the project in her spare time. \n\nIf she wanted the project to be done fast and within a certain time frame, she should have paid the 1000+ pounds and hired someone who could work on the project fulltime.", "This has happened to me with graphic design favours as well. Tell them to kick rocks. They can get it quoted somewhere else, don\u2019t give them any more of your time. NTA", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nI would state what you said above. \"I happily agreed to work on this larger project for you at no cost. I currently work full time and essentially have a part-time job tending to the rescue animals in my care. \n\nWhen texting me, please keep all of this in mind. This is a large project that I am doing as a favor.. From start to finish it takes roughly ____ hrs to complete. If you want more prioritization, you can absolutely hire someone. This job would cost over 1k, possibly 2k. They would most likely quote you 6 months to complete. I am 3/4 of the way complete and have gone above and beyond on your project. I have created 19 slides and have hand drawn images in photo shop. I have even gone above and beyond by providing weekly updates via video chat.\n\nI'm going to continue to work on this project during my free time, when my schedule allows. I will text you with updates moving forward. We will be discontinuing weekly video chats unless I have a need for it.  have gone above and beyond and would appreciate it if your communication towards me reflects the fact that I am doing this as a favor. I would appreciate more gratitude and less entitlement, especially when im grieving. Thank you.\"\n\nI would send a message like that.", "It's your fault to accept the task knowing you don't have time. At this point, you can only finish up the project as soon as possible and take it as lesson, never offer your time for free", "Even though it was free did you set reasonable expectations before starting the job? Just because you knew this was a job that would take a professional 6 months doesn\u2019t mean that they knew this.\n\nNah"]}
