I was happy to do this for them and originally she\u2019d said \u201ctake your time, there\u2019s no deadline\u201d etc. I also work full time AND run an animal sanctuary with my partner. My time is extremely precious to me. \n\nFast forward a few months and I am now receiving a huge amount of pressure and sarcastic messages. On Thursday this week I told her that I\u2019d lost one of my patients under anaesthetic whilst my vet tried to save his life and I was really upset. 15 minutes later I got a text saying \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve had time this week to do said project then\u201d. The fact I hadn\u2019t even finished crying about one of our deaths, before I got that, has really upset me. I didn\u2019t respond.

I hate confrontation and always feel like I\u2019m in the wrong but I\u2019m particularly upset and feel I need to set boundaries.

Don\u2019t offer to do projects like this for free or family. They can pay for it or have somebody else do it if they really want it.", "Reading your comments, NTA. You\u2019ve been doing work on it and giving weekly updates, which means you\u2019ve been communicating. (That was my question when I first read the post.) This was a bad week and you\u2019ve had other priorities. If someone isn\u2019t paying for a project it goes to the bottom of the list during a bad week. If they wanted a deadline met, they should have paid.", "\"I work around 14 hours each day.

Remind her of the death, and tell her that if she isn't going to respect your time - especially your time to grieve - then she can find someone else to do the project.\n\nAs someone who also cares deeply about animals, you have my sincere condolences for your loss. Prioritize you, your partner, and the grieving process over this person. If what they want you to do for them is worth it, they'll wait for it or go pay someone else to do it. You lose nothing by not doing this project if they're going to be an ass about it.\n\nNTA. Give the animals extra lova and treats for me.", "NTA.  She's gotten project updates, and agreed to an informal timeline.  She shouldn't be rude about it.  \n\nThat said, it's a good idea to give project timeline estimates, even when there aren't deadlines, and build in some redundancy.\n\nSimply give her a new timeline, and let her know how much work you've done so far.  \"Hi MIL, I've put about 100 hours into the project so far, and it should be done in 2-3 months.  If you need it done sooner, I can export the files and send them to you.  I don't have a lot of free time, and things have been pretty sad/stressful here, so I appreciate your patience.\"  \n\nIf you don't want to work on the project anymore, just tell her it's been too much and send her the files for another designer to finish the project.  You don't owe it to her.", "NTA.  But get better at assertiveness and confrontation.  Tell her what you told us about how many hours you work and volunteer, and this was a favour in your free time.  TBH you didnt really estimate how much time this would take and set her expectations, which a business person should do.  You should tell her that you realized this project is too big and you don't have the free time, and it will take you months. Since she needs it done in a timely manner, she should hire someone.", "NTA tell her to hire someone", "NTA. I would tell her explicitly that you don't appreciate being hounded about this, you spend as much time as you're able to sacrifice for her little project, but you have a job and a life that comes before a free favor. Her expectations are extremely unreasonable, and the way she's been treating you is very rude and disrespectful. You need to set a firm boundary that you work on it when you work on it, it's done when it's done, and you won't be tolerate any more harassment (and yes, it is harassment) about it.", "INFO : How much work have you done on this project that would take at least six months? Are you giving her progress reports? Have you even started on the project?", "OP, you need to rewrite this post. The way you wrote it sounds like you haven't done much work on it and are getting annoyed because they're following up too much. \n\nThe actual issue is you're 3/4ths done, you've done weekly video calls on it (jfc) but didn't have time to do that this one week and they're repeatedly harassing you over that. \n\nAt which point, hand everything over and tell them you can't continue this at this point. NTA. 19 drawings and scenes that are hand drawn in Photoshop for free is ridiculous. Dump it all back.", "NTA \n\nBut I wonder if you could communicate better?\n\nYour partner's mother certainly could.  Good grief.  Her messages to you aren't appropriate and so this needs to be addressed.  It doesn't need to be confrontational.  \n\nYou just need to explain your current demands and state when realistically you would be able to get it done and ask if that is ok or if it's better that you bow out as it's become clear to you that whereas she originally said \"no deadline\", the need has become more serious.\n\nIt's good practice as you will be sure to have more interactions and with this type of person, you will need to set boundaries and make things clear.  \n\nI'm sorry you have been going through this stress.  Thank you for the work you do with animals!", "NAH, but--and this is a big but--\"a few months\" seems like a long time to make someone wait.\n\nIf there was a deadline you should have been told before you agreed to do it, and if you couldn't complete the project within that time line you shouldn't have agreed to do it.\n\nI think you're both falling a bit short of what should have happened here.", "I\u2018d say NAH. On the one hand I get that you got a lot to do (and thank you so much for your work, it\u2019s so important!!\u2764\ufe0f) but on the other hand I can understand her as well(although she could\u2019ve shown more empathy). The way I understood it it\u2019s been a few months so maybe she does need it soon. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, thou!", "NTA\n\nShe told you to take your time and gave no deadline, so she doesn't get to pressure you. Ask? Sure, but not be as insensitive and pressuring as she sounds.\n\nLet her know that if she keeps pressuring you, she can make it herself or find someone else.", "Esh - my ten cents.  My family works in a similar field.  I think the problem you are having is that maybe you felt pressured to do the job and because you are not being paid for it, it is not a priority for you, at least that is what I am getting out of it.  That is understandable.    \n\n\nWhat we do in our business is offer a discounted rate for family/ friends and we still do a timetable for deadlines.  It really makes a difference, the comments that your 'client' is making are unprofessional but to be fair you didn't establish a professional agreement.  I think at this point you and the client need to set up a mutually acceptable timeline, maybe in the future this can serve as a basis for how you would handle future requests from family members.    \n\n\nGood luck and I am sorry to hear of your loss.", "I can't decide if this is NAH or mild ESH.\n\nThis is a miscommunication, IMO.  You took her literally when she said 'there's no deadline' and projected that to mean ever.  I think most people would understand 'take your time' doesn't mean 'It's okay if I don't get this for months.'  After a few months, its reasonable she would be asking about it. She might be mild esh for her sarcasm, though I understand her frustration.\n\nYou might be mild esh because this delay is beyond 'not prioritizing' it, IMO.  You just haven't done it, whether due to time constraints or life circumstances or whatever . Ya'll need to have a mature conversation about this and either get the project done soon, or cut each other loose.", "YTA - without context of the ask/offer. You said you'd do the work (could have said no without any issues) and assume you offered the work for free. Any reasonable person would think a few months would be a good timeline to work with despite the \"Take your time\" comment. Either tell her you're too busy so she can hire someone else or do the work like you said you would.", "A few months? Did you mention how long she would need to wait? If not, YTA. If you did, NTA.", "You say a professional would need 6 months, why didn\u2019t you set any sort of time frame?  How many months have gone by?  YTA for not clarifying a time frame.  Best bet now is to be upfront and say you no longer can complete the project.   Put your big girl panties on.
