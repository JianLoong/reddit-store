{"id": 23720, "submission_id": "15g6g3c", "title": "AITA for sending my sister a Thank you note for the \"gift\" she gave my husband and I at our wedding?", "selftext": "Background: I (24F) married my husband (23M) last month. It was a beautiful ceremony. I am currently 27 weeks pregnant, I was 24 weeks at the wedding. My sister (28 F) was not invited. She has substance abuse issues and undiagnosed BPD. She also has a history of physically assaulting me.\n\nMy parents invited my sister despite myself and my now husband not wanting her at my wedding. They insisted the whole time they would watch her and swore she'd be on her best behavior. She ended up going off multiple times, causing several huge scenes and when my MOH asked if I wanted her removed my parents wouldn't let me ask her to leave because \"she had no way of getting home\". When all of these behaviors happened my parents shrugged it off and said \"sorry we can't control her actions\". \nThe entire night before the wedding and day of she was coughing on everything. She even got sent home from work the day before but insisted it was allergies. She ended up getting me and my husband sick and we spent our wedding night and the next night in the ER. My parents keep insisting she had allergies and couldn't have been the one to get me sick. They keep insisting I had allergies too and only went to the hospital because I didn't want to clean up afterwards. \nSo, every time I talk to my mom now she asks if I have sent out \"thank you\" cards. I am so tempted to write my sister one saying thanks for getting us sick and endangering our unborn child. BTW she will never be in our lives or near me or my family again. \nI know this will bring me a mountain of shit from my parents but I am so tired of being railroaded every time I say I don't want to be around her. I can also add wayyy more details if anyone wants them. So obviously its petty but maybe worth it. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: lots of people were asking why I didn't kick my parents out at the wedding. \n1) most importantly this day was about MY HUSBAND and ME. I didn't want to draw any attention to her by doing something like calling the police or even acknowledging what she was doing in the moment. If I called her out she would've had a bigger crowd to scream in front of and honestly I didn't want to give her any opportunity for attention that didn't belong to her.\n2) I didn't want to give her the satisfaction of thinking she ruined my wedding. Her whole goal was to get a rise out of me and I barely said two words to her all day. On the phone my mom gave a half ass apology and said \"sorry your sister ruined your wedding\" but she didn't. She tried but I still had an amazing day with my amazing friends and partner.\n3) if I kicked out my parents too there would've been more stress and problems. My mom provided all the food and she absolutely would've taken it with her. And again I didn't want my wedding memories to be tainted so much. I just wanted a normal wedding with parents that respect my wishes. Unfortunately I didn't get that but I still had an amazing day.\n\nEdit two: my sister is the only person who could've gotten me sick as I saw her over 72 hours before the wedding day. Also I really don't care if she wasn't the person who got me sick at this point you can't convince me it wasn't her. Especially because she came to a wedding sick and uninvited.", "created_utc": 1690975851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g6g3c/aita_for_sending_my_sister_a_thank_you_note_for/", "score": 765, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
