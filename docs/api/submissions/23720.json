{"id": 23720, "submission_id": "15g6g3c", "title": "AITA for sending my sister a Thank you note for the \"gift\" she gave my husband and I at our wedding?", "selftext": "Background: I (24F) married my husband (23M) last month. It was a beautiful ceremony. I am currently 27 weeks pregnant, I was 24 weeks at the wedding. My sister (28 F) was not invited. She has substance abuse issues and undiagnosed BPD. She also has a history of physically assaulting me.\n\nMy parents invited my sister despite myself and my now husband not wanting her at my wedding. They insisted the whole time they would watch her and swore she'd be on her best behavior. She ended up going off multiple times, causing several huge scenes and when my MOH asked if I wanted her removed my parents wouldn't let me ask her to leave because \"she had no way of getting home\". When all of these behaviors happened my parents shrugged it off and said \"sorry we can't control her actions\". \nThe entire night before the wedding and day of she was coughing on everything. She even got sent home from work the day before but insisted it was allergies. She ended up getting me and my husband sick and we spent our wedding night and the next night in the ER. My parents keep insisting she had allergies and couldn't have been the one to get me sick. They keep insisting I had allergies too and only went to the hospital because I didn't want to clean up afterwards. \nSo, every time I talk to my mom now she asks if I have sent out \"thank you\" cards. I am so tempted to write my sister one saying thanks for getting us sick and endangering our unborn child. BTW she will never be in our lives or near me or my family again. \nI know this will bring me a mountain of shit from my parents but I am so tired of being railroaded every time I say I don't want to be around her. I can also add wayyy more details if anyone wants them. So obviously its petty but maybe worth it. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: lots of people were asking why I didn't kick my parents out at the wedding. \n1) most importantly this day was about MY HUSBAND and ME. I didn't want to draw any attention to her by doing something like calling the police or even acknowledging what she was doing in the moment. If I called her out she would've had a bigger crowd to scream in front of and honestly I didn't want to give her any opportunity for attention that didn't belong to her.\n2) I didn't want to give her the satisfaction of thinking she ruined my wedding. Her whole goal was to get a rise out of me and I barely said two words to her all day. On the phone my mom gave a half ass apology and said \"sorry your sister ruined your wedding\" but she didn't. She tried but I still had an amazing day with my amazing friends and partner.\n3) if I kicked out my parents too there would've been more stress and problems. My mom provided all the food and she absolutely would've taken it with her. And again I didn't want my wedding memories to be tainted so much. I just wanted a normal wedding with parents that respect my wishes. Unfortunately I didn't get that but I still had an amazing day.\n\nEdit two: my sister is the only person who could've gotten me sick as I saw her over 72 hours before the wedding day. Also I really don't care if she wasn't the person who got me sick at this point you can't convince me it wasn't her. Especially because she came to a wedding sick and uninvited.", "created_utc": 1690975851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g6g3c/aita_for_sending_my_sister_a_thank_you_note_for/", "score": 377, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They\u2019re the ones that gave your her presence! \n\nNTA", "NTA and I hope, for you own sake, that you put your AH parents on an information diet regarding your birth and newborn. They are not to be trusted.", "NTA, but you are definitely going to have issues with your parents, they completely disregarded that you didn't want her at your wedding because age would cause problems, brought her, then said they couldn't do anything about it when she caused problems.\n\n\nThey will absolutely try to expose your child to her at any chance they get, I'm assuming because \"she deserves to know her niece/nephew, she'll behave\", \"niece/nephew deserves to know their aunt, she'll behave\", etc... excuses.  I don't think you'll ever be able to trust your parents to babysit and you are going to have to be prepared to walk out of family dinners, get together, vacations, because they will invite her.", "NTA. But I do wonder if any of the other guests also became ill?", "NTA. The biggest AHs here are your parents. I'm so sorry.", "NTA. While you're at it, send your parents a thank you for ruining the wedding. They insisted that your sister be there, her (predictable) behavior is on them.", "I think its best to not send anything, just completely ignore her. If shes that big a trainwreck/drama queen, that will drive her nuts way worse than a card.", "YTA to yourself and all your other guests for not hiring security knowing what your parents and sister might pull.", "why are you not cutting your parents off??? why did you not put your foot down at YOUR wedding...? NTA but you created your own problem", "Don't send it to your sister. Send it your your parents. You state that you have a sister problem, but the story you tell is a parents problem. Send them the \"Thank you for getting me sick and putting a damper on my wedding day, none of these terrible things could have happened without you and your selfish interference\" card.", "NTA\n\nSend the note, but your parents need to face consequences for their actions and part in this.\n\nThis is on them.", "Uh, you shouldn't leave your parents unsupervised with your child. They will let your sister see your baby behind your back. Your sister and your parents ruined your wedding and they're not even sorry. NTA", "NTA\n\nBut seriously, it's past time you go no contact with your sister AND your parents.", "NTA, but I don't understand why you're still speaking to your parents at all when they treat you this way.  They have a clear favorite and it's not you.  It will *never* be you.", "NTA\n\nSorry your wedding was disrupted by such awful people.\n\nI'd consider going low contact with your parents as they obviously can't accept and respect your wishes. It won't get any better when your baby arrives either. They'll walk right over your decisions as parents.\n\nGood luck!\n\nPS: It's not petty! She made a pregnant woman sick, ruined your wedding, and your parents reneged their promise to keep an eye on her!  \n\n\nEdit: typo", "Nta your parents are. I\u2019d go no contact with them.", "You need to cut your sister AND your horrible parents out of your life. It might be hard at first but you don\u2019t want them to ever watch your baby and have them bring sister around to play auntie. It\u2019s unsafe and your parents will never put her in her place. They don\u2019t deserve to be in your life or your baby\u2019s life. Cut them all out mama!", "I would send a  thank to your parents for finally showing and clarifying that your sister will always come first.  That there is no limit they will have in subjecting people to your sister's chaotic and destructive behavior.  Because putting your child above all others is something that you will do as well.  You will put your child's wellbeing over their need to ignore everyone else to get what they want.  Also, as your child's parent, you will not subject yourself or your family to the selfish, carelessness of others and will have boundaries in place to make sure what happened at the wedding will never happen again because your child comes first.  \n\nIt was a painful, but ultimately eye opening lesson to how things will be from now on.   You love your child as much as they love theirs.  They made their decisions and now you will make yours.", "NTA. I would consider going NC with your parents considering they betrayed your trust and went against your wishes and they\u2019re also massive enablers for your sister.", "NTA if you wanted to do it - but isn't that exactly what she wants?  To be the victim of your \"pettiness\"  Girl please -  just let it go, and live your life.   Dont continue to look for justice in an unjust situation.   Youve got a wonderful husband, a baby on the way and life ahead.  You dont need a parting shot - you know what youve endured, and you dont want to endure anymore.    Period.  End of story.", "ESH - she sucks\n\n\n\nBut all you'd do by sending that note is picking a stupid fight of stupid drama. Why add to stupid interactions with her?", "NTA but your parents deserve a \u201cthank you\u201d card too. They clearly care more about your sister than you. Sorry about your wedding", ">BTW she will never be in our lives or near me or my family again.\n\nIt sounds", " Until you follow the directions there, we have nothing to discuss.\"", "Remind your parents that whatever illness your sister brought could have killed your baby! Their excuses are inexcusable. \nNTA", "For real.\n\n> my parents wouldn't let me\n\n?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!??!?", "She simply won't have access as she doesn't know where I live and I am not bringing the baby to my parents house.", "Yes my friend who was sitting right next to her and her husband asked well.", "I couldn't even afford flowers let alone security", "[removed]", "!bot", "Don't give her the satisfaction. Cut her off and go low contact w/ your parents.\n\nYour parents do not care that they allowed your sister to do this, will not admit they screwed up and will do it again if you give them the chance. They will bring your sister to meet your baby and to your baby's christening, etc. \n\nYou need to draw a line w/ your parents. Your husband and child are your first priority and they don't get to ruin anything more b/c they want to pretend there is nothing wrong with your sister and resent you for not going along w/ their fantasy.", "Don't forget to add \"and thank you for showing me, with finality, that you and our parents are no longer welcome in my life. Your actions really highlighted that you bring nothing but strife and misery everywhere you go; and that's helped me make the important decision to excise you from my life. My sincerest gratitude for making that decision so much easier. \"", "Okay, so does your parents know where you live?", "Yes", "Your parents don't have keys to your place, do they?"]}
