It was a beautiful ceremony. I am currently 27 weeks pregnant, I was 24 weeks at the wedding. My sister (28 F) was not invited. She has substance abuse issues and undiagnosed BPD. She also has a history of physically assaulting me.\n\nMy parents invited my sister despite myself and my now husband not wanting her at my wedding. They insisted the whole time they would watch her and swore she'd be on her best behavior. She ended up going off multiple times, causing several huge scenes and when my MOH asked if I wanted her removed my parents wouldn't let me ask her to leave because \"she had no way of getting home\". When all of these behaviors happened my parents shrugged it off and said \"sorry we can't control her actions\". \nThe entire night before the wedding and day of she was coughing on everything. She even got sent home from work the day before but insisted it was allergies. She ended up getting me and my husband sick and we spent our wedding night and the next night in the ER. My parents keep insisting she had allergies and couldn't have been the one to get me sick. They keep insisting I had allergies too and only went to the hospital because I didn't want to clean up afterwards. \nSo, every time I talk to my mom now she asks if I have sent out \"thank you\" cards. I am so tempted to write my sister one saying thanks for getting us sick and endangering our unborn child. BTW she will never be in our lives or near me or my family again. \nI know this will bring me a mountain of shit from my parents but I am so tired of being railroaded every time I say I don't want to be around her. I can also add wayyy more details if anyone wants them. So obviously its petty but maybe worth it.

I know I will never forget how you made several scenes, (list them). They were epic, sure to be recounted when anybody there mentions my wedding. Or anybodies wedding, really. Epic.\n\nAnd the gentle way you coughed all over the  canap\u00e9s the night before the wedding. Thank you for that. And the wedding night my husband and I spent in the ER, well, I hope you weren\u2019t corralled into cleaning up while we were lallygagging at the hospital.

Congratulations on the wedding and the pregnancy!\n\nThis would be a move that your parents would consider an AH move, but I think it is a move that you are justified is doing. I think you might even be justified in escalating things and sending a \u201cthank you\u201d to your parents for inviting your sister to your wedding against your explicit wishes, saying that they would watch her, and then breaking their promise. \n\nIn short: your parents are just as responsible for you getting sick as your sister is and it\u2019s time they took responsibility for it, because, if this is an example of their behavior, they have been enabling her.", "NTA but you should've kicked your parents out", "NTA,  but don't forget. Your parents brought the gift that kept giving.  You should send them a similar thank you. \"Thank you for inviting someone to my wedding against my wishes.

When the very predictable issues happened, she shrugged her shoulders and said she couldn\u2019t do anything at all. Then, when you ended up in the ER she blamed YOU and showed zero concern for her unborn grandchild.  I think you just learned that your mother isn\u2019t safe to leave your child with unsupervised. She\u2019ll just invite the baby\u2019s aunt over without your consent and let that child be harmed because \u201cthere\u2019s nothing she can do about it.\u201d She has proven that exactly already. \n\nWhen people show you who they are, believe them. Do not leave your child alone with your mother. She should not be considered a safe adult.", "Do it , pettyness is the bomb", "You would be the AH, but sometimes you need to be the AH. Do it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Do it! You parents were A Hs for inviting your sister and then not \"taking control\" when she did what she always does. You can match their petty with a lovely thank you note. Don't hold back and clearly count the ways she effed with your wedding.", "Is there a JAH - Justified Asshole tag? If your objective is to get her out of your life forever, then do whatever it takes to get her out of your life forever.  Maybe that means sending her a card and having a big blow up with not just parents, but making sure extended family knows.  You probably want to send your parents a card too then.  Thank them for the gift of family at the wedding.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an advice sub, but I will say that maybe your best bet is to list for yourself everything she has done, and everything your parents have done. Then go no-contact.  Live your life to bring as much joy as you can, because revenge makes us feel powerful, but it doesn\u2019t feel as good as gratitude and joy.  You will also need to work through why you keep giving into your parents so you can shut them down when they try to get back into your life.  Good luck.", "NTA also I would suggest cutting your parents off as well.", "NTA. She sounds awful and was definitely why you were sick. Stay strong girl, family is wild!", "She sounds awful but if your only exposure to her coughing was at the wedding itself, it\u2019s unlikely that made you sick enough for the ER that same evening. It\u2019s possible that you were exposed to something a day or two earlier.  Going no contact is perfectly reasonable but endangering the life of your child is a bit over the top.", "You cannot get sick the same day you\u2019re coughed on.", "If she was coughing at the wedding and you got er level sick that night, then she likely didn't get you sick. There is an invitation time between exposure and symptoms that is usually days. You were almost certainly infected before your wedding", "YTA - it\u2019s so petty to do that.

You knew she was sick when she , you concealed it so you'd be allowed to attend anyway, so we'd be exposed.
