But if they didn\u2019t tell you what they wanted, then just dont buy anything at all.\n\nYouve also enabled the situation where they don\u2019t work and are slobs.

If you assume one of them is going to be taking care of the baby, it is still reasonable to require that one of them get a job or they both move out.  \n\nAs for buying all the baby stuff, you were completely wrong. This is not your baby. No one asked you to buy stuff for it.  It\u2019s up to the parents to decide what their baby needs and to figure out how to get it. Learn how to step back & wait to be asked. When the baby comes, let them be the parents. Don\u2019t take over & tell them what to do.", "NTA. You've been more than kind and generous. Don't buy anything else.

I cant imagine being a soon to be parent, unemployed, doing no household chores, and then being angry that the person that houses me ALSO purchased quite a bit of things for my baby. \n\nSocial media has made everyone decide that babies are accessories and need to fit into an aesthetic. Which whatever if you can finance it. But they can\u2019t and they should be grateful. Since they are not I would stop buying things. I\u2019d also tell your son to get a job or get out.

One caveat I will give though: sometimes our parents do things that really hurt us, so we end up doing a 180 for our own kids and parenting. But there\u2019s always a possibility that we overcompensate too hard and give our kids their own kind of struggles. Just something to keep in mind", "NTA. It sounds like you have been incredibly supportive and generous towards your son and his girlfriend during their pregnancy. It's understandable that you want to provide for your grandchild and make sure they have everything they need. It's also understandable that you bought gender-specific items if you weren't given specific requests or preferences.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that everyone has their own opinions and preferences when it comes to parenting and baby items. It sounds like your son's girlfriend may have different ideas about what she wants for her baby, and it's important to respect her wishes and listen to her input. You may want to have a conversation with her and your son about how you can best support them and what their preferences are, so that you can work together to provide for the baby's needs.\n\nThat being said, it's not fair for them to not talk to you or show gratitude for your support. It's important for them to recognize and appreciate the effort and financial contribution you've made towards their child. It's understandable that you may feel frustrated or hurt by their behavior, but it may be worth having a conversation with them about how you feel and trying to work towards a resolution together. Ultimately, it's important to prioritize the well-being and needs of the baby, and to work together as a family to provide the best possible environment for them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just called one day and said she was dropping it off. (And it was nice. Probably not quite what I would have picked, but nice.) She wanted to throw our baby shower, which was nice of her except when she told us we found out she\u2019d already done the registry. My oldest had quite a few things I would never have selected. (The stroller\u2026 ugh. I didn\u2019t pick it. It was selected by her and several aunts and uncles chipped in to pay for it. It was a lovely gesture.

I think you are terrified of what your son is (and what his gf is). \n\nAnd like all parents who raise kids into adults who are lazy and selfish\u2026\n\nYou carry a lot of guilt. But you also know you aren\u2019t lazy or selfish (\u201chow did this happen?!\u201d) so that guilt comes with a confusing dose of resentment. \n\nBut again, you\u2019re terrified. They can\u2019t be on their own with a baby because they are so lazy and selfish it\u2019s toxic. And if you actually hold them accountable, they may totally tank their lives and leave. \n\nSo instead of engaging in difficult conversations or setting real boundaries, you get hung up on smaller dramas like the baby stuff and you make silly ultimatums in place of boundaries (it stays here if you move out!). \n\nSo no I don\u2019t think you are a martyr. I think you\u2019re guilty and resentful. The only way out of that is to hold your adult son accountable. Whether or not he will be is his choice. Unfortunately you can\u2019t trust him to make the right one. But you also can\u2019t force him to be a productive member of society or an adult who provides for the family he\u2019s created. \n\nAccept that. And set boundaries.", "What you should do is stop doing anything until they ask for help.", "It\u2019s time to kick them out. They can find a family shelter program. You can be available to take the baby in if they can\u2019t get themselves on their feet. \nIf you want to make it easier on them, pay their deposit and first 2 month rent on an apartment and tell them it\u2019s up to them after. They can apply for social services like WIC and EBT for food.", "Ok so I\u2019ll just let my grandchild go to foster care cause oh it\u2019s not my kid and who cares if these two cannot only not afford a baby but are also so messy that cps wont let a child live in that environment.\nYes you ARE right I should have just been totally oblivious to the fact that a child is on the way and has needs because it\u2019s not my child.\nMaybe that would\u2019ve made them wake up but maybe it would\u2019ve made my son turn his back on me.\nYes I did make a huge mistake and I wish I could go back and said my piece when I was told about the pregnancy and yes I\u2019ve tried to make good on my son what was done wrong to me.\nI hope to God they get their shit together and I am going to step back and no longer do anything for them or the baby.\nI didn\u2019t see it as enabling I thought I was being supportive and doing what I felt was my responsibility and yes I did but what I wanted from my money that I work hard for.\nMy mistake , I should\u2019ve just let them deal with it , kicked them out and lived my life.", "Thank you! You are spot on.", "So your suggestion is now that she\u2019s bought everything she wants for a new baby, she should kick out the parents for being ungrateful and try to get custody of the baby for herself? Can\u2019t she just back off and let them be adults without kicking them out?", "Get therapy. You are displaying some colossal cognitive distortions.\n\nYou also displayed why they don\u2019t want to talk to you. \n\nGet help. You need it.", "Just stop! You sound like a martyr.  This child is not your responsibility. This is where you went off the rails. This is not about what patterns you choose,  you are stepping on son and gfs toes and you are not helping them become responsible for their own issues/ child. They don't need to if you buy everything. \n\nReturn everything you can.  You're probably going to need different items when your son gives up this child anyway down the road.  You'll need your money then to support this child when your son gives up because it's too hard.", "It seems you have some unresolved issues from when you had your child. It also seems that the circumstances in which you had your son has pushed you to enable and spoil him all his life. You don\u2019t give him agency, you haven\u2019t done anything to get him to stand on his own, you have just continued babying him, including your plan to simply just step in and raise his child for him, without even discussing it with him or his partner. You need to see that you are not helping him and will certainly not be helping your grandchild. Your son is about to be a parent himself, he needs to begin to stand on his own (with his partner). Unless circumstances mean your grandchild is placed in your care as primary carer, you need to step back from parent lane and stay in your grandparent lane.", "> Ok so I\u2019ll just let my grandchild go to foster care cause oh it\u2019s not my kid and who cares if these two cannot only not afford a baby but are also so messy that cps wont let a child live in that environment.\n\nOh, for fuck's sake, that's obviously not what the poster was saying.  They were saying to just throw the kid into the sea, way less paperwork"]}
