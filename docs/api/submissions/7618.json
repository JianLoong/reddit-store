We don\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen this even more often in family where at least one sibling is disabled. \n\nThe notion that we also have lay down our lives for decisions we never made? Would it be nice? Of course, but they need to learn to plan ahead these circumstances. Which I\u2019m guessing they haven\u2019t bothered with considering entitled they\u2019ve let your sister become.

No one can assume or enforce one person's care on another.\n\nYou are a good person for stating clearly that this is not going to happen.  Some people would avoid confrontation and simply abandon the sibling, and you did not take the cowardly way out.  I'm sorry for any pressure they laid on you, but you are really doing the right thing, in a lot of different ways.\n\nYou are giving the parents every opportunity to set up your sibling with benefits, a legal guardian, and a plan for the future.  Depending on where you live, there may be a lot of other people who have gone through this, and step one is verifying benefit eligibility.  If you are in the US it might be a state or county agency, and the sooner they get started, the better. \n\nSide note:  the animosity you feel toward your sibling sounds painful for you to experience.

She is not your responsibility.  You are under no obligation to care for her, nor should you.  Your mom and her husband need to start prepping her now for being at least semi-independent.

You are in the right.", " NTA, it is not your responsibility.\n\nAlso, as a special education teacher for high schoolers and young adults, they really aren\u2019t doing her any favors. After aging out of special Ed, there are sadly not a lot of options for people with disabilities who can\u2019t live independently. Day programs currently have years-long waiting lists in my state. It\u2019s a sad state of affairs. If she really is high functioning, she is perfectly capable of learning some independent living and employment skills. I get that having a child with a disability is incredibly difficult, but if they are really concerned about her future, they would have started in on some tough love years ago and she\u2019d be more independent today. Sounds to me like they were more interested in making their lives easier by giving in to her, rather than toughing it out through challenging behaviors (which in the long run would have resulted in better outcomes for HER)", "NTA.
