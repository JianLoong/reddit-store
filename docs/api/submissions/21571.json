You can also talk to her about the bill and why you are concerned.", "NTA, as long as you approach the subject respectfully. It's 100% understandable to be concerned about your bills, and imho asking her to close the windows isn't a big ask.", "Wow, No, YWNBTA - That's incredibly selfish of her.  I would change the utilities charge and put in a clause if it goes over x amount she would be responsible.", "NTA. This won\u2019t only cause a huge electric bill but could cause your a/c to fail. Tell to close the windows or you will have to raise her rent substantially.", "NTA\n\nThis is incredibly wasteful.", "You can't tell a tenant not to open windows - houses need airing out etc and it's pleasant to have them open when it's warm. You should have responsibility for sharing the bills etc agreed with your tenant with a legal contract anyway, but it was your choice to run the AC and expecting her to keep the windows in the rooms she's renting closed whenever it's on (assuming she even knows it's on) is unreasonable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Does she know you were in her space?", "INFO: is their only one thermostat, and where is it? If it's in her section of the home, that central air is never going to stop running with the windows open.", "I would say telling a tenant they can't open their windows is selfish. It's not them running or asking for the AC.", "I get what you're saying...but I don't think many people would agree with you that 90+ degrees with high humidity is pleasant. She knows it's on.", "How do you feel about asking her if we can agree on a comfortable temperature? I'm not turning my AC off when it's this hot, but I'd be willing to turn it down if she had said something", "Especially since ACs do provide dehumidification (while not as much as say a whole house dehumidifier, they will get rid of some).", "NTA. I see a few people getting hung up on what you can and can't tell a tenant, but they're missing that your also in a shared jome with this person making her also your roommate. Talking to her about coming to a compromise on thermostat setting and utilities cost.", "YWNBTA. I think if you're living with someone, functionally as a roommate, then it's perfectly fine to discuss issues like utilities in a reasonable and mature way.", "NTA for saying something, that\u2019s terribly wasteful, but I\u2019d be thoughtful about how I approach it. She may hate AC or prefer hot temperatures. Also, if you only noticed this one time it may be that she only had the windows open temporarily due to a problem (airing out an odor, for example).\n\nEither way I would approach it more from a problem-solving, asking questions angle than a yelling at my dumb tenant angle. Maybe you need to find a way to accommodate different temperature preferences or address a different concern to make it livable for both of you while also not wasting tons of energy.", "YWNBTA, its a tenant relations thing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an aside.  Is it possible to block the vents in her area?  Providing AC is not required like heat is;  If she wants it hot.  It doesn't make sense to give her cold.", "NTA. Can she at least close the vents in her area if she wants the windows open?", "NAH - Some like it hold, some like it cold. \n\nIf the thermostat is in that area of the house - then it will run all the time. \nIf the thermostat isn't in her area, then it won't register. \nI have an old house. There are rooms I don't heat or cool and it has zero effect on the HVAC because the doors to those rooms close and it doesn't affect the thermostat.\nYou can't tell her to keep windows closed. You can tell her to close her vents or her doors. You can add an electrical surcharge to her rent if her actions are affecting the HVAC.", "As someone who hates being cold and would be happy in a home around 76-77\u00b0F... I think you need to work on a compromise. I love the heat of summer and a cold AC home sucks IMO. I'm at work, it's 92 out, and I have a fucking space heater in my office because the guys like it at 68. \n\nSo maybe talk to her about a compromise? Can she close/narrow the AC vents in her areas? Do you have a single AC feeding everything? You said \"up there\" and I've been to many places where the different levels have separate units. \n\nNAH, IMO. It seems more like you guys may not be compatible for a shared living space with shared AC.", "I\u2019m just here for the \u201cY T A for being a landlord\u201d comments. Don\u2019t mind me.", "You can say something, but she will be able to do what she wants legally.  Morally she's wrong (uses electricity, wastes fuels to make the electricity, wears parts, etc).  But she's allowed to do it.  \n\nYou did kinda screw yourself by having just a flat rate.  You should have had a lower rate plus half utilities.  \n\nAnd she owned a house and had kids?  But she's renting a room from you?  Sounds like she's used to being in charge and doesn't care about your kindness.  \n\nNTA", "NTA to say something to her. She\u2019s a tenant, so you can\u2019t make her close them, but she may just not be thinking it through", "ESH. I hate being cold so just like right now I got the window open the the ac is on I rather be hot then cold on any day so", "NTA she\u2019s doing it on purpose. Honestly, I\u2019d kick her out. She\u2019s not going to change. You\u2019ll see it will be worse if you address it.", "Have you communicated with her at all? It doesn't sound like you have, just assumed that \"she knows\" when the AC is on. And you say she \"constantly\" has her windows open. Is this while she's at work? Maybe she has the windows open during the cooler part of the evening and mornings before she leaves? If that's the case, how is she to \"know\" when you close up windows in the rest of the house to run AC once it gets hot if she's not in the house or you don't let her know? I have my windows open in the mornings before work, and if it gets hot enough in the day the thermostat kicks on the AC, I get a text and let someone know my windows are open and they have my permission to go in my room and close them. And there have been other times when it doesn't cool off like it's supposed to, or warms up and I come home to a stuffy room because no one told me the air was off and we were relying on windows, or it didn't cool my area properly because my windows were open. \n\nIt sounds like you guys just need better communication and to be helpful by opening/closing windows if needed if the other person isn't present. Talk it over, not in a \"you're running up the bills\" upset way, but a \"we have this issue, what can we do *together* to solve it\" manner.", "exactly.", "I used to live in an attic studio, ans my landlord put a window unit in there bc the central air didn\u2019t keep it cool enough.", "Maybe you need to find a way to accommodate different temperature preferences or address a different concern to make it livable for both of you and not waste a lot of energy.", " \nI hate being cold, just like opening the windows, turning on the AC would rather be cold than hot any day", "\"houses need airing out\" is how you get mold in a humid climate", "Yeah I agree this is highly dependent on thermostat placement. When I shared a house rental I would sometimes open my window in the winter because my room was an attic one upstairs and got a ton of residual heat, even when I closed my vents. I had a good under door seal and it never made the temp budge in the thermostat downstairs. \n\nIf the thermostat is in your area OP and you don\u2019t have doors with huge gaps, odds are your cooling costs aren\u2019t being affected by their room much at all. Have her close her door if she isn\u2019t already and buy an under the door seal if needed. NAH", "I concur", "She is thinking. She doesn\u2019t care. She pays a flat fee. So she knows the electric bill will be high and she will not pay anything.", "Why not just turn the AC down if you're too cold?", "They have to get on the same page. Running the AC constantly because one of them had windows open is not a workable solution.", "Yeah there are lots of possible solutions. My situation is worked out but OP can look into that if the AC isn't working well in his situation.", "That would be very reasonable. Sharing heat/air with someone is definitely a fine line between melting and freezing.", "I had a bit of this struggle with my girlfriend. As long as things are coordinated with us it\u2019s no problem at all. It\u2019s windows OR air conditioning, not both. If one of us wants something different for a room we\u2019re in we try to keep the doors between rooms mostly closed to cut down on airflow between cool and warm areas of the house.\n\nIf she likes the breeze instead, find some way to allow her to close off her area.", "You could turn the temp up a couple degrees and she can close some vents. Absolutely have a talk with her.", "My problem is that I need windows open. I want wind, bird sounds, etc, not closed-off ac", "Kick her out. She won\u2019t get better. You\u2019ll see.", " \n\nIs it possible to block the vents in his area? No need to provide AC like heat; If she wants hot.", "If it's in her section of the home, that central air is never going to stop running with the windows open.", "When it's 90 outside and it harms the rest of the house?  \n\nJust go outside.", "That doesn't work nearly as well as you might think unless you have a zoned system with dampers built into the ductwork. Closing too many vents increases the static pressure (resistance to airflow) in the ducts, which makes the system have to work much harder. All of the heat gain from keeping those windows constantly open will also still make the entire house warmer so that the AC still needs to run more often and for longer each time.", "It doesn\u2019t harm anything. Close the vents and close the doors.", "Most houses are not that well insulated between individual rooms.  Also vents usually don't close off all the way.  \n\nThis will cause lots of pull on the AC which can cost thousands.  \n\nJust go outside if the temp is above 80 and you want the window open."]}
