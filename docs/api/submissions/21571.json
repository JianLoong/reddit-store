Yes it's wasteful to have the windows open, but it's not actually changing the bills.", "Regardless of comfort, running the AC with windows open causes the AC to work harder, which burns more energy, and kills the planet faster.  This applies even if the thermostat is in a different part of the house because return air vents move the hot air from her part of the house to the HVAC unit where the coolant cools that air and returns it to the rest of the house.

Neither thing is air-tight, and it doesn't lower the costs. Unless OP has an incredibly expensive HVAC system, there is ***no way*** to block off the AC from the tenant's portion of the house.", "That would only help a bit and it still wouldn't prevent or overcome all of the issues that occur when the air pressure isn't correctly balanced. The issue is that air still flows through those duct branches where the vents are closed and then gets trapped since it can't flow out of those vents, which causes the pressure in the entire ductwork to increase. That means the blower has to work much harder to circulate air and uses more energy. It can also lead to the blower overheating and the system shutting down until it cools and then needing to be manually reset before it will run again.\n\nIncreased static pressure also leads to more air blowing out of the more central vents. That in turn leads to almost no air blowing out of the vents at the furthest ends of the ductwork causing those rooms to always stay too hot.\n\nHigh static pressure can cause duct tape to blow out at the seams where different pieces of duct connect so that lots of air starts to leak out. The overall wear and tear on the entire system is also greatly increased when the air pressure isn't properly balanced. If more than 25% of the vents in the home are closed, your energy costs will be much higher than if all of the vents were open.\n\nETA: The reason that using a fan to draw air out of the vents isn't really effective is that the increased pressure in the vents prevents the blower from drawing as much air in. The less air coming in, the slower the system will cool and the less air there will be coming out of the vents.", "I can\u2019t sleep without a window open. AC is an unnecessary luxury. You can\u2019t impose it on people.", "I guess all houses are different. My intakes are both inside and outside air. Why not push some are into the internal intakes also then? Why not draw on the periphery but not on the central?", "You can when it's your house.  The AC stays on.  The tenant ***can*** legally have their window open, yes.  If it's above 80 when they keep it open then they're AHs.  Legally allowed, but still AHs.  \n\nIf you want everything perfect for you in a house you don't own when you're living with the owner... then move.", "Do you have central AC? Portable and window ACs sometimes draw air in from outside, but I've honestly never seen a central system that draws air in from outside since that would greatly reduce the overall effectiveness unless the outside temp is no higher than the current indoor temp. If the outside temp is higher, all it would do is pull even more hot air inside.\n\nYou could use fans to push air into the return vents (intakes) and pull air out of the supply vents as you said, but you'd still have higher than normal pressure due to all of the air getting blown into and trapped inside the duct branches where the vents are closed. The only way to avoid that is to use dampers to block off the entire branch instead of just closing off the vent.", "Nah. I just open the windows.", "When you take on a tenant with utilities included you agree that they're paying a flat rate to you no matter how much of said utilities they do or do not use.

If she\u2019s too cold then she can ask you to adjust the AC.", "NTA find out what is going on and how the f does someone not know that windows should be shut when the ac is on??", "What an Idiot. Everyone why is in a car on a hot day knows AC is useless with the windows open", "NTA but please approach from a place of curiosity - ask questions as to why it\u2019s happening and don\u2019t assume.", "Ywbta if you enable this bad behavior and don\u2019t straighten it out. See if you can work this out with a conversation. Other than that let her know she will soon be paying for utilities because when you gave her the no untility option it was with the assumption that she would use your utilities wisely. Is it as simple as lowering the amount of cold air she receives some how?", "YWBTA and charging a flat utility fee was a terrible decision. If your tenant is paying everything, they can damn well live how they want in their own home. If you renew a lease, that's when you can change it from a flat utility fee. \n\nMy landlord got all pissy at me because their house heating and ac is terrible and expensive. They charged me a flat rate and that was their dumb idea. My new landlord has me pay national grid directly because that's what's standard. Don't become a landlord if you can't afford it.", "My bottom floor is freezing, but the top floor is boiling rn and the AC has been running full blast up there for days. And the top floor is way smaller than the bottom floor! (row house). It could just not be working up there.", "Have a chat, and depending on what she says look into changing the thermostat setting or seeing if you can vary the airflow to her room.", "Fuckin thank you. I'm absolutely awed at the landlord bootlicking here. OP decided to be a landlord and charge a flat utilities fee. It's on OP to deal with it without making the tenant change what they're doing. Don't charge a flat fee for utilities if you don't want to pay for whatever is or isn't used.", "Opening windows when the ac is on is not rational.", "OP can't unilaterally kick a tenant out because they're upset that a flat utility fee was a dumbass idea", "This is wild. Turn off the ac.", " I'd be curious to know if you have one central unit, one thermostat located in your portion, if where her unit transfers heat directly into yours, and where the return grilles are.", "Bot account", "What are you talking about?  It's entirely rational when it's warm outside, you are too cold, and you have no way to turn the AC down.", "My bottom floor is freezing, but the top floor is boiling rn and the AC has been running full blast up there for days. And the top floor is way smaller than the bottom floor! (row house). It could just not be working up there.", "It's never assholeish to ask OP and start a discussion!!", "Oh man, if it was 72/22 in my house I would have a hard time wearing anything more than shorts and a t shirt", " Providing AC is not required like heat is; If she wants it hot. It doesn't make sense to give her cold.", "Info: why were you in her part of the house and did you give notice you were entering? Depending on the location/circumstances notice is required to enter.", " You should see if the AC is effective on her floor.", "This was my first thought. I used to rent an upstairs apartment with my landlord downstairs and I would have FLIPPED if she entered without asking. But it depends how shared their space is I guess", "Ikr! AC will just latch up.", "Keeping the windows open while the AC is on is just stupid", "Tenant is overwhelming the AC by leaving windows open. That\u2019s costly to fix. Op could give her an eviction notice or the tenant can be responsible.", "Can you close off the vents to her space?", "They are not in a roommate situation. OP owns the property and rents it to them, that makes OP a landlord and the coworker a tenant. OP is also their own tenant. That's way different than a roommate situation.\n\nETA: splitting bills with roommates is normal. Charging your tenant for everything over X amount is possibly not, because they're charging them for a supposed use without metering. I see this as having two apartments with shared utilities and making the tenants pay the bills individually. If the coworker is in a separate \"unit\" (which I feel is implied, but OP can correct me) then you can't pretend they are roommates.", "This is what I'm wondering.", "I didn't live in a place with air conditioning until a few years ago, so every summer I'd have all my windows open and fans running to circulate air.", "Heat rises\u2026", "Or the ductwork runs through the attic and it's not well-insulated or worse, it has a hole and it's sucking in attic air.", "INFO: have a convo with her; if she's got all the windows open there's probably a reason for it. What are you setting your AC to (assuming that it's not a zone system).\n\nIt sounds like she's doing this specifically because she likes it a lot warmer than you.", "INFO, did you have your tenant's permission to be in her area of the house?", "NTA but def get some vent covers and have a talk bc they are obviously too cold!", "Yeah I feel like closing/covering her vents is the solution here if she thinks it\u2019s too cold. If she thinks it\u2019s too hot there may be something wrong with the AC and needs servicing.", "They're not going to find a common temperature because the insulation sucks. Heat rises and then there's the heat conduction from the roof which will stay in the higher part of the building because again, heat stays up high. So trying to compromise won't be, \"We'll agree on 72 and we'll both be comfortable,\" it's going to end up, \"I'll set it at 72 so we'll both be comfortable but in reality you're going to be miserable at almost at 80 and I'm going to be fine because it's worth it so I don't have to pay more on the electric bill.\"", "Or just cool certain rooms like your bedroom with a window unit. Or close her vents and close off her section of the house.", "We don\u2019t know what part of the house she is in versus he isn\u2019t. If she\u2019s in the upper floors and opening the windows on a 90 degree day, then it sounds like she may be feeling colder than he is. He just needs to raise the AC a few degrees.", "That's what I had to do with my roommate. Blocked off my vent, and I live in a hoodie. 73 degrees is too cold for me if I'm sitting still.", "NTA", "NAH.  A couple of things may be going on here - and you really should talk to your tenant.  1 issue may be that she is an older woman, and her idea of hot is different than yours (older ppl can get cold more easily - especially if they're on blood pressure meds).  If this is the case, ask her if you can block the vents in her space (with removable magnetic covers) so the AC isn't continuously running.  She can then remove the covers when she needs to. \n\nAnother issue may be that the AC doesn't adequately cool the upstairs (a frequent occurrence in 2-story homes) & opening the windows is the only way to keep air flowing through.  If this is the case, offer to buy (or pay 1/2 of) a portable air conditioner (I don't mean a window AC, but a portable floor model).  This will assist in cooling the upstairs & will also help keep the downstairs cooler.", "Not everyone wants to live in a refrigerator. Could be that it's way too cold. \n\nYTA", "Most well written leases will definitely establish utility maximums or have some other clause defining use of the utilities. This sounds like an occupant/boarder/roommate type situation with little official paperwork though, so OPs coworker has very little in the way of tenants rights.", "Let me introduce you to me. I still need a jacket in 75 degree weather. My husband is the opposite so we compromised. We sleep with windows open but with a box fan. Which still gets too cold for me but then he doesn\u2019t die from stagnant heat.", "NTA: but some people are weird about ac, and rather have windows open. She might be one of those.", "I think you should just ask her what's up and then work on a solution. Maybe she is cold or maybe she just likes having the windows open. Try to come up with a compromise. You could close the vent to her room if she is too cold. You could also try better insulation around her door to reduce the amount of your cool air going out (or rather the amount of heat seeping into your living area). She would have to keep her door closed.\n\nMy mom actually has a window unit in her bedroom (in addition to the central AC). There isn't anyone else in the house. She just likes her bedroom extra cold. Something for you to consider if you end up compromising on the thermostat.", "I'm sorry but if my landlord said I was not allowed to have my windows open, I wouldn't live there anymore. It's a ridiculous request regardless of your reasons. Some people really value fresh air regardless of temperature.\n\nI can't believe people are on the landlord's side in this, of all disputes.\n\nBy the way we pay the bills and do AC with windows open often. And we're in 110 degree Houston.\n\nYTA", "You have to be careful with closing vents and running an AC. You can end up with condensation and mold. Better to partially close it. So, the cold air can move some.", "This is bad advice. That would result in higher air pressure and increased energy usage.", "But if she isn\u2019t using the AC and OP *is*, it isn\u2019t fair to charge her if the AC is shared/used to cool both spaces.", "anything higher than 72 is terrerium temps to me", "u/Optimal5077 is a bot.", "u/Rude821 is a bot.", "u/Upstaicrs9 is a bot.", "Definitely.
