The AC where I live needs to be updated (not the AC itself but the way it's connected to the rooms) it works well in every room except mine. If it's cold and I turn on the AC every other room is freezing, if it's hot same thing no change for me but a sauna in the other bedrooms. You should see if the AC is effective on her floor. You can also talk to her about the bill and why you are concerned.", "NTA, as long as you approach the subject respectfully. It's 100% understandable to be concerned about your bills, and imho asking her to close the windows isn't a big ask.", "Wow, No, YWNBTA - That's incredibly selfish of her.  I would change the utilities charge and put in a clause if it goes over x amount she would be responsible.", "NTA. This won\u2019t only cause a huge electric bill but could cause your a/c to fail. Tell to close the windows or you will have to raise her rent substantially.", "NTA\n\nThis is incredibly wasteful.", "You can't tell a tenant not to open windows - houses need airing out etc and it's pleasant to have them open when it's warm. You should have responsibility for sharing the bills etc agreed with your tenant with a legal contract anyway, but it was your choice to run the AC and expecting her to keep the windows in the rooms she's renting closed whenever it's on (assuming she even knows it's on) is unreasonable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
