I (33F) go to my local barre studio and have had great experiences so far.\n\nI try to go to class about 4-5 times a week. Last week however, I was out of town on vacation so I didn\u2019t work out at all.  I signed up for 2 classes (one morning, one evening) on the day I got back so that I could get back on track with my fitness. I have \u201cdoubled\u201d a few times in the past and found it to be a little intense but doable.\n\nThe teacher for both classes was a lady named Annie who is very sweet and can be a little shy. I think she is relatively new to teaching. I noticed when I took the second class in the evening that it was completely identical to the first one, same moves in the exact same order. I understand that it would be harder to learn 2 classes for 1 day, but I have seen other teachers do it and she had all day.

Do you think she just teaches those two classes in the day - and sits on her butt the rest of the time, doing absolutely nothing?  \n\nIf *you* want variety, don\u2019t book 2 classes with the same instructor in the same day.", "YTA.  You say you were \u201cjust a little bummed but didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.\u201d  Then you proceeded to make a big deal about it and complain to both the manager and the teacher. What does it matter if you did the same routine twice?  You went for exercise and you got it.", "YTA. Most people dont take multiple classes, and she shouldn't have to learn two routines for the random days you decided you want to get back on track. Being a teacher and trainer is hard. \n\nAnd she might not be new to teaching. She could be an experienced teacher. Not everyone likes having aggressive teachers. Some like the very sweet teachers who are kind to them.", "Yta!!\n\nHoly hell, it\u2019s normal to use the same lesson on that day unless you take a different skill level. My yoga instructor has several classes per day, if you want different routines on the same day, sign up for different instructors. \n\nAnd apologize for your ignorance before you take her class again!", "YTA. Like personal trainers, group fitness instructors develop programs for every class. They have a repertoire of what does and doesn't work for each level of class. There is a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes. Developing a program for a class takes time and knowledge. Yet you expected her to pull a different rotation out of thin air for you? Well, aren't you just special.", "Yeah, I'm going yta. \n\nHow does two in a day more effectively get you back on track? How luxurious a place is this? Keeping track of whether anyone happens to be taking two classes with the same person in one day is asking a lot for something that happens so rarely", "YTA, your suggestion was for her to note that you were in both and change everything she was going to do just for you. You aren\u2019t the main character. And then you were so upset that they ignored your \u2018friendly suggestion\u2019 you had to go vent about it to your bf?", "Jeez, of course YTA", "YTA\n\nSeriously, though.", ">On my way out, I told the manager at the front desk\n\nYTA - you went directly to the manager instead of approaching the instructor and saying \"hey, if I come 2x in one day, would you mind mixing up the routine a bit for me?", "It\u2019s crazy they didn\u2019t have two separate routines at your personal gym !!! \n\nSeeing as you are the only client there, it should be catered exactly to your needs. \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nShe is not responsible for your schedule. It's entirely reasonable to teach the same class throughout a day.", "YTA.  How would you feel if Annie came in to your place of work and gave your boss her opinion on how you should do your job better, and after your boss defended you she went to you and told you how to do your job better?", "You sound exhausting. Of course YTA.", "YTA. No human that knows anything about fitness classes books two of the SAME classes in a day and expects it to be different. ABSURD.", "YTA", "They definitely talked shit about you after you left.", "YTA-  at my studio, you're not even allowed to take 2 of the same class formats in the same day.\n\nMost teachers do this as their second job. Learning one class per day is hard enough, especially as a new teacher, and if you teach 2 of the same class in one day, you always teach the same class the second time. \n\nNext time, keep your \"suggestions\" to yourself and enjoy the knowledge that you're the type of client we hate.", "YTA. Wow.", "Good god how entitled.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nDid Annie ask for feedback or suggestions? No. \n\nYou submitted your suggestion to management. They answered you. That should have been the end. \n\nYou are looking at it from one perspective - what would most benefit you as an individual. You are unaware of all the factors it takes in creating & executing multiple fitness classes. Do you think Annie gets paid for the time it takes her to create & rehearse a new class routine? Nope. The time to make new music mixes? Nope. \n\nDon\u2019t sign up for multiple classes taught by Annie that are the same level. That\u2019s the suggestion to you to best get the diverse classes in the same day.", "As a barre teacher, YTA.", "Yeah YTA for sure. Insufferable. Just a heads up for the future, the world doesn\u2019t need to cater to you.", "YTA yeah that was rude.", "Maybe this will help you understand why YTA\u2026\n\nImagine you make two reservations at a restaurant, two nights in a row. The first night, you order a little bit of everything on the menu. The second night, the menu is exactly the same, because that\u2019s how a menu works. \n\nWould you suggest to the chef that they should\u2019ve come up with a handful of new dishes JUST for you with less that 24hrs notice, just because you\u2019d already eaten there the day before?\n\n(I sure hope you answered No because I genuinely don\u2019t know how to help if you would actually fucking do this)", "YTA. If you want personalised training, get a PT. And unless you have been fallowing Annie all day you have no idea whether she has been busy or not. She probably has other tasks at work besides planning these classes.", "INFO is the class listed as the exact same class? If yes, you are way off base because it's literally the same class but at different times. \n\nWhile I think you are TA, I also see a tiny bit where you are coming from, in terms of the dance world. Can you clarify what this barre studio is all about? Is it a gym, with barre classes? Or is it a super legit dance studio with lots of high-value teachers and a robust client base? I mean, if we are talking Broadway Dance Center, then yeah. The teacher needs to switch up the class, IMO. But if it's CorePower Yoga, but barre, well that's a different set of standards and you are off-base IMO.", "NAH. There is nothing \"psycho\" about wanting variety in the classes you take (and it wasn't rude to make that suggestion), but the studio doesn't need to provide it within a day's classes either. It seems perfectly reasonable that a teacher have a set pattern for classes per each day of the week. \n\nNow if every class you take over the week with this teacher is the exact same, then you've got something to complain about.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re not really supposed to take two classes on the same day, and of course they teach the same class.", "YTA\n\nYou told her manager, told her, and then told your bf. Unhinged.\n\nMaybe consider a personal trainer who is paid to accommodate your whims.", "At my studio you can\u2019t even take the same format twice in one day because the routines are decided ahead of time and they don\u2019t want you overworking your body with the same moves in one day. The owner told you they weren\u2019t taking your suggestion. Saying it to the instructor after was an overstep. YTA", "Yeah, the \"she had all day\" comment made me cringe.", "For a lot of instructors, teaching is a second job - annie probably had more pressing things to worry about in the hours between her am and pm classes than making sure the moves were different between the two on the off chance someone takes both", "And to her boyfriend. Sounds pretty rude to me. Seems like OP thinks everything is about her.", "I was about to say, I'm a yoga teacher and I will teach the same lesson if I'm teaching the same class more than once in a day. A lot more work goes into creating those classes than just the hour you're teaching, which most of students understand.", "Not out of thin air, but she could have checked the day before and seen that I am in both of her classes and planned accordingly.", "the barre studio is doing a challenge to have members take 20 classes in 30 days; people will sometimes take two classes in a day to meet that goal. The studio offers a few different formats where the moves/exercises are different, but it sounds like OP took two classes of the same format, hence the identical moves - usually when people double up they take two different formats or they may take two of the same format but with different instructors (so the class structure is the same but moves/exercises may be slightly different from the class they took before)", "Rightly so haha.", "It is pure barre so there are 4 types of classes.  Both of the ones I look were \u201cClassic.\u201d", "Barre is a workout. It\u2019s not dance. You aren\u2019t there to learn steps or routine, it\u2019s a workout that incorporates some ballet positions and has a barre, but also has elements of yoga, pilates, and even stuff like burpees and push ups.", "You can not be serious. She\u2019s supposed to check and compare every class she teaches to see if there are duplicate students?!  Do you think they just walk in and make it up as they go along?\n\nIt\u2019s YOUR responsibility to verify if it\u2019s the same class not the instructor.", "yes because everything is about you.\n\n...seriously", "YTA\n\nI think you are being overly entitled . It\u2019s unreasonable to expect a fitness instructor to change a class for 1 student . Not everyone else is doing the same class twice in a day so why should she change it ?", "Well that is some entitlement.", "jesus christ the world doesn't fucking revolve around you", "Here\u2019s the thing. Several teachers work full time. If I am teaching twice in one day, I absolutely check the class list during the day multiple times. But I do not have time to learn a new class during my work day. I teach before work, go straight to work, then sneak out early to teach again.", "But why should she have to do that? Just for you?", "If I were Annie moving forward I\u2019d look out for you in my classes and purposely do the same choreography. You should be embarrassed - I def would be if I were you and would feel super awkward going back to that same studio.", "Are you for real?", "It\u2019s wild, but you aren\u2019t the Main Character. People will not plan things just for you. YTA", "Now why would she need to do that? She likely has several classes, with many students. You are not the main character.", "She cannot change a class routine on the fly simply because you randomly one day decided to take the same class with the same instructor twice. Other people who regularly go to her class at that time & that day don\u2019t deserve THEIR expect class to be disruptive for YOU.\n\nIf you want custom designed classes for you, pay for a private instructor.", "This is such a batshit crazy thing to say. I audibly gasped. \n\nInstead of taking a second barre class in one day; you should use that time for some therapy.", "How would that be fair to the rest of the class?", "You cannot be serious. This is so entitled and frankly, delusional. You really think that because she has ONE student who was in both classes, she should change things up? If you want variety, that\u2019s up to YOU. YOU sign up for a different instructor or a different intensity level.", "I can assure you, no one will do all that for one entitled student. She had her lesson plan for the day. If you didn't want a repeat, you should have asked what other classes were being held that day. You have a lot of growing up to do.", "That doesn't answer the question of why you're so important they should plan their lives around you? And check for something that very rarely happens?? Because you were out and you're the main character? Like what. Why are you the most important person?", "Psssssst, babe ... *you're not the main character.*", "This has to be fake. Who thinks an instructor should base their whole class around one person?", "The world doesn't revolve around you", "You took the same format so yeah, this is typical.

Some studios even have all Classic classes on one day follow the same exact routine", "[deleted]", "Massive main character energy here.", "I have to admit, that response alone made me go from \"this is completely believable\" to \"I hope this is a work of fiction and a troll\" because anyone with *that* level of narcissistic entitlement is staggering. Surely she would have difficulty functioning in day-to-day life with that kind of world view. Like... I can't even imagine some spoiled Victorian debutante thinking along those lines, ffs.", "We would all say OP is 100000% YTA", "Oh my god right??? Like honestly how would she even fit in the building with how big her head is", "It also just shows an astounding lack of empathy for others. The teacher probably doesn\u2019t have time to plan an entirely new class, and OP, because she thinks she\u2019s god\u2019s gift to this earth, thinks that she should change the class up for ONE single person"]}
