Grandma will sometimes decide that she just doesn't want to eat on a certain day, other days she'll eat with a bit of coaxing but the best days are when she asks us to make something specific for her because we know she's going to eat well.

And yes, we've made the same thing using chicken eggs but she could tell the difference. My grandma is the only one that eats turtle eggs in my family, for clarity. We buy it only for her. \n\nWe don't make it everyday, only when she asks for it. When my friends came over, she was eating leftover turtle egg pancake. My grandma loves meeting and talking to new people, so she started engaging with them pretty quickly. One of them \"C\" even sits down beside her. My grandma offers her some of her food. C asks her what was in it. Grandma tells her. C starts asking her why she was eating that, that it's a horrible thing to do. \n\nI take C away from my grandma. C's still upset. I wasn't apologetic about it, and I tell her that grandma doesn't understand or remember the whole turtles are an endangered species thing, even when we explained it to her- she just understands it as a food that she enjoys.  Which made C even angrier. She told me she doesn't care about the reasoning, only horrible people eat endangered animals. I kicked her out after that. \n\nLook, if C wanted to blame anyone she should've blamed me or the rest of my family. Because while grandma can ask for a certain food, it's us that make it for her.

That's our problem, not grandma's. \n\nAnd obviously this whole party has gone to shit now, because we were supposed to have it at my place and there's no way in hell I'm letting C back in my home.

I don't, that's why I asked. If turtles are kept as kettle and lay eggs specifically to be harvested, then I don't see it as any more problematic than chicken eggs. However, if people are stalking around and raiding nests of wild turtles to get those eggs, then indeed everyone involved would be TA. The hunter, the seller, you and your grandma. And in that case C was right to call you out for it.\n\nIn Japan it's not illegal to catch whales. That doesn't make it ok.

Your willingness to take the blame for preparing the eggs shows how good your intentions are; your objection is to your young friend heaping moralistic judgement on your senile grandmother\u2014 understandable! You tried to prepare chicken eggs; it didn\u2019t work. Your family is doing its best to care for her, and one old lady\u2019s penchant for turtle eggs is not going to end the sea turtles. Tell C to go unleash her ire on the people collecting and selling the eggs.", "NTA. You are right, it's not on senile grandma's head if her brain just doesn't work to accept new facts about the turtle existence status. Nor is it on your head that you want your grandma to have nutrients and this is the only way that works. Your friend is very immature if she can't see these nuances.", "NTA and by all means give grandma what she wants if thats what she eats. Maybe its one of those things she enjoys or remembers from the childhood and since its legal who cares about what the entitled C thinks. You had every right to kick her out and I would have done the same. People at your grandma's age is from a generation when life was tough, people were free and possibly lived off what was available. Its too old for them to understand endangered species or the so called moral high grounds of generation z. So well done for sticking up for your grandma and hope she's keeping well and enjoying the food she loves.", "NTA. Clearly, getting your Grandma to eat is the priority. I think it\u2019s sweet that you take care of her!! Turtle eggs are legal to buy and it\u2019s one of the few things that she will eat. Also, it\u2019s not like your Grandma eats them every meal.", "*Legally obtained* turtle eggs, ok, then. If that\u2019s what grandma wants, then that\u2019s what grandma gets. She is 96, indulge her while you can and be grateful she has an appetite. \n\nC doesn\u2019t have to like it. C can just give you the cold shoulder and not talk to you. As my husband would say, \u201cDon\u2019t threaten me with a good time\u201d.\n\nIf your friend group just can\u2019t have some party at your place, now, because C is having a hissy and your friends are too petite to have an opinion? Well, then, I guess everybody misses out on the party. NTA", "Just because something is legal doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s moral. \n\nNTA for taking care of grandma but \u201cnot completely prohibited\u201d doesn\u2019t that mean that they are banned in some places? Are they legal where you are or do you have to have them shipped to you? And you did say turtles are endangered and you could tell her that you simply can\u2019t get them anymore. \n\nSo whoever it is that is continuing to obtain the eggs is an AH.", "Id say NTA. When it comes to really old people, like 70+ you sometimes just gotta be polite and patient, even if they are annoying you or saying/doing something you dont approve of. Also food judgy people are annoying.", "Why are turtle lives worth more than chicken lives? Factory farming of chickens to get their eggs is absolutely horrific. Your friend is being hypocritical", "NTA. Your friend came to your house, and had the audacity to be condescending to your Grandma for eating some eggs? Unless it\u2019s illegal to consume said eggs, then it wasn\u2019t her place to preach about it. \n\nNow look, I get some people get all weird about certain species of egg, but as you said your grandma wasn\u2019t breaking any laws. Good for you for kicking your \u201cfriend\u201d out", "Did you know C was very passionate about endangered species? I know there's some who feel real strongly on environmental issues and maybe a word beforehand on grandma's eating habits could have avoided that confrontation.\n\nThat said, C went 0 to 100 in a downright hurry and was over the line. NTA", "NTA first of all. \n\nC insulted a resident of your home, while she was a guest in your home. She absolutely should not be allowed back in your home. While your other friends may be impacted by this, it's not their home, and not their decision. So staying \"neutral\" in this case means supporting your right to make *that* decision.\n\nYou *absolutely* can tell the difference in taste between turtle eggs and chicken eggs. My great grandmother made a turtle egg omelet without telling us when I was pretty little... it's one of the only memories I have from that age, and I can *still* taste it, talking about it. It was unexpected and I was little so I hated it, but... your grandma is correct here.\n\n>She told me she doesn't care about the reasoning, only horrible people eat endangered animals.\n\nIf my 13 year old bites someone, there will be pretty serious consequences. \n\nThey bit someone when they were 2, and they got a stern talking to, and had to apologize (all that was necessary, it never happened again, lol).\n\nThey also bit me when they were about... oh, idk... 7 months old. Pretty hard, they had a few teeth already. And no, there were no consequences. Because a 7 month old cannot understand right and wrong.\n\nThe point is... morals and ethics are about choosing to do what is right or what is wrong. If your grandmother is unable to recall that turtles even *are* endangered, she *cannot* apply C's logic here. Grandma is in the clear.\n\nBut C may have meant that *you* were in the wrong for providing the eggs.\n\nAnd in other circumstances I might agree. However, if the eggs are all your grandma will eat, and you have the ability to provide them *legally*, then you have a moral and ethical obligation to do so. You cannot just choose to starve this elderly woman because you disapprove of her food choices. That would be elder abuse. It would be wrong, and depending on location/circumstances, possibly illegal.\n\nSo you're in the clear here.\n\nC is an AH for how she handled the situation. However... look, we all do AH things sometimes. It doesn't mean we *are* AHs. It's highly possible she was just reacting in *shock*, as this is something she may never have encountered before. \n\nIf she's never acted like this before, and she feels bad/apologizes to you and grandma, I might write it off as just shock. \n\nIf not, then, well, at the very least your priorities are incompatible. Sometimes friendships run their course, even without fault on either side.\n\nI'd definitely lay out your boundaries regarding this situation to your friends... clearly and calmly.\n\n\"I understand some of you may agree with C's belief, but she did insult my grandma in her own home, and is no longer welcome in that home. This isn't up for debate.\"\n\nAnd offer options\n\n\"We can still host the party at my home, but C will not be attending. Or we can have the party somewhere else. Which would you prefer?\"\n\nSomething like that allows neutrality and enforcement of your own boundaries, without making them feel cornered.\n\nPS: I do think eating turtle eggs is (under almost any circumstances) wrong. But if I were stranded on an island with no other food, I definitely would eat them. I don't think *this* grandma doing so in these circumstances is any more wrong than that would be.", "NTA C is. She is calling a 96yr woman who barely eats horrible. You don't treat someone's beloved elderly relative like that. C owes you and your grandmother an apology.", "NTA. Good on you for doing everything for that sweet old lady rather than dump her in a home.", "NTA - I think C is lacking maturity here. They can disagree with something ethically without being rude to your grandma, especially when they're a guest in that home. If Grandma's food is too distasteful (which I can understand) then they don't need to be there.", "I agree with you. I find it so bizarre that a lot of posts are calling the friend weird or just saying it's fine when, like...how was this stuff obtained? And from what animal?\n\nI think that if the animal is endangered, eating it is abhorrent. I don't think legality justifies it. I don't think \"she doesn't understand\" is an excuse, I'm fine with saying OP is the asshole for making it if the animal is endangered because *they DO understand.* I don't think it's merely \"political correctness\" to want to not wipe out a species. Honestly this comment section is just bananas to me.", "I\u2019ve had a google and i can\u2019t find any farms. There are numerous articles about finding them in the wild though so I would think that\u2019s how they got them. \u2018Legally obtained\u2019 is a potentially tenuous", "It depends. Many turtle species are endangered and it would definitely be wrong to be eating their eggs - in this case sale of them would be banned in the vast majority of countries under the CITES treaty.\n\nTurtle farming is a thing though - specifically of non-endangered species. You should look into the source of the eggs you are buying. This may be a VERY serious issue or it may be not much different from farmed chicken eggs.\n\nNot possible to pass a judgement here without more info such as the species of turtle and the ethical nature of the farming process.", "Agreed. If the process by which the eggs come to market includes confirming that the eggs are not fertilized (and the animal is not being prevented from mating in order to ensure unfertilized eggs), then it's not particularly relevant whether the animal is endangered, as those eggs were never going to be another of the species.", "I have to ask, I presumed we were talking unfertilised turtle eggs, so taking the eggs has zero effect on turtle population, as those eggs wouldn't ever have hatched anyway, right? I don't understand what's immoral about removing what is essentially turtle waste products?", "[https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol26/iss4/art14/#eggconsumption](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol26/iss4/art14/#eggconsumption)\n\ninteresting study on turtle eggs though its localized to Malaysia.  Most likely the eggs are either raised or harvested legally and while morally gray the eggs will be consumed either way and demand will not be majorly affected by OP attempting to feed their aging grandma.", "[deleted]", "Chickens aren\u2019t endangered and are farmed. Turtles are wild creatures and so their eggs are stolen from the wild.", "Turtles are endangered. You can\u2019t even touch them in Hawaii. My grandfather ate them as a kid in the 30s and now he talks about how few are left.", "No one was stranded.", "Yeah OP mentioned trying to swap out chicken eggs and grandma notice but I\u2019m curious about anything else they tried. Telling her the store was sold out? OP dropped them on the way back and the eggs cracked?", "I don't presume anything, that's exactly why I asked. If those turtles are endangered, I don't understand how their unfertilized eggs are sold because that would clearly involve breeding those turtles and thus them not being endangered. But the world is complex and it might not be as simple as I imagine.", "Your study states that the egg harvesting was legal previously for select individuals but was then banned, and some beaches are now protected.\n\nBut on unprotected beaches, people harvest and will sell the results, though it's formally not legal. This leads to the decline of subpopulations.", "Darn those woke Gen Z moralists, wanting older people not to eat endangered animals so that they can continue to exist for future generations rather than avoidably dying out because we had a craving.\n\nHow selfish of them rather than us (?)", "I never said they were. But grandma is malnourished and this is one of very few things she can eat. I see it as comparable circumstances."]}
