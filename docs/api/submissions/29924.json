How come he knew she was going there to study? I mean in a big university with lots of classes I'd think it difficult to casually cross paths...\n\nBut anyway NTA because this is again very odd, I mean, it's family, it's no big deal so why not mention in conversation, like in passing talking about your day say something like hey!
