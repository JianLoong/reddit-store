He\u2019s the middle child of 5 kids. \n\nWe planned our thanksgiving dinner a couple months ahead and invited our relatives over for thanksgiving. My son is very socially inept and doesn\u2019t understand his actions might be considered hurtful, rude or inappropriate and I\u2019m working with his therapist and his school on how to behave in social situations. \n\nTo make a long story short. It started off as a debate with one of his 5 cousins at dinner, and mentioned an unknown woman by name, and when I pressed him on what he\u2019s talking about, he stated that his uncle, which is my sister\u2019s husband brought a random woman in our house when I asked them last minute to look after the kids when I was called to work. I stopped him from speaking any further and knowing this was going to lead to an argument between adults, I had to send all of the kids upstairs to the bedrooms. I tried everything I could to deescalate the situation and keep the peace. I wanted to make sure that any grievances are held off until after dinner. It quickly devolved into screaming matches and crying. \n\nI had no idea he was having affairs and I was mad that he was bringing women in our house with children, and I tried to hold off until after dinner because I was trying to keep it positive. I was really mad and told the uncle he\u2019s not welcome back. \n\nI told my son that private adult matters should be kept private and that he can\u2019t just talk about these things out loud in front of the whole family and all of the children. And he shouldn\u2019t be bringing up sensitive topics(he brought up his sisters personal trauma without permission) at the dinner table. And because he couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut, I took away his Video games, his phone, his computer and tv until the new year. My son cried and said that he didn\u2019t know the matter was private, and that he wasn\u2019t supposed to say anything. I chalked it up to common sense. \n\nI know the affair wasn\u2019t his fault and that wasn\u2019t the problem. The problem was that he discussed the affair publicly and failed to tell me or his dad that his uncle was bringing women in our house which was a month ago. \n\nI feel like I was too harsh on my son. \n\nReddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1670400717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zevowr/aita_for_punishing_my_son_for_bringing_up_private/", "score": 1320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA.  Why, because you just punished your son for your BILs bad behaviours.\n\nAnd why the heck does BIL have free access to your house?   That alone isn't your son's bad behaviour, but yours and BILs.", "So, let me get this straight. A month ago, this uncle brought an affair partner into your home when he was asked to babysit your children. Plural--children--and you don't mention any others having autism or other issues. Two of those children are older than 12. None of those children told you about this.\n\nBecause of this, you end up punishing a 12-year-old who has autism for talking about his personal experience--telling the truth--at a time that is inopportune for you.\n\nYes, YTA. The uncle's an AH. Did he coerce the other kids into not telling you about this strange woman in your home? Honestly, the whole situation doesn't pass the sniff test, but then YTA for shitposting, so either way, YTA.\n\nApologize to your child, restore his privileges, and be a better human.", "YTA. \n\nThis is exactly the type of parenting that's going to defer your son from telling you other bad or even dangerous situations that might be happening in his life. Sure it might not have been appropriate for the time and setting, but he wasn't aware. You're teaching him that being honest about things is always going to get him in trouble. I'm sure this is going to impact his self-esteem quite a bit, too. \n\nBad parenting move.\n\n\nEdit: added \"bad\", since this situation specifically wasn't necessary \"dangerous\" - though it was still pretty messed up.", "YTA.\n\n>failed to tell me or his dad that his uncle was bringing women in our house which was a month ago\n\nWell, congratulations: now he'll never tell you a damn thing again, because that's safer than risking punishment.  Blame the adult who was too stupid to even conceal his wrongdoing from the kids, not the kid who simply reported what happened.", "YTA. your brother bringing a stranger into your children's home without your knowledge should be a big deal. also if your children hid your husband cheating on you because it's \"private adult issues\" how would that make you feel? You don't think your SISTER deserves to know she was being taken advantage of?", "YTA In your first paragraph you state he is socially inept and doesn\u2019t understand. Obviously you\u2019re going to have a chat and work through what happened but you can\u2019t punish a kid for that, even a neurotypical kid could bring it up not realising the shot storm it would set off", "YTA You don't even sound like you like him.", "YTA. Your son waited until he felt safe to share this important information. His uncle was putting all the kids at risk by bringing strangers into your home. Imagine how scary that must be for any child but especially a child on the spectrum since they are often very anxious about new people. You can\u2019t expect children to understand the adult significance of the situation.\n\nPunishing your son sends the message that he can\u2019t trust you. The issue isn\u2019t that he shared it, its that his uncle did it in the first place. You should be your son\u2019s safe space, someone he can share anything with, especially situations like this. Sit down and apologise. Tell him you were shocked and you wished he\u2019d told you sooner but you\u2019re glad he shared it with you. Emphasise the importance of letting you know straight away if any strangers come in the house and explain that you want to keep him safe.", "YTA. You asked him. He didn\u2019t know about the affairs and probably doesn\u2019t even know what an affair is or that his uncle shouldn\u2019t be bringing women over. Even if he didn\u2019t have the problems he does, most 12 year olds would still say something like that at the most inappropriate time just because they lack the common sense not to.", "YTA he is a kid and didn't know any better or mean any harm", "How is he supposed to know that his uncle bringing a random woman along is a \u201cprivate adult matter?\u201d   Into your home??????  It ceased being a private matter once your BIL exposed himself. Quite frankly, it was likely a good thing your son innocently spoke up so that your sister is aware of this. \n\nYour son is autistic and you would know that he did not say anything to deliberately cause trouble or hurt anyone, but now you are totally confusing him. Do better.\n\nYTA. So is your BIL. So is anyone that is upset with your son.", "YTA. It is not up to a 12yo to perfectly handle being exposed to an adult relative's affair. He had no context or plan for this. Be more worried about the absolutely horrible situation your kids were put in and less worried about the dinner vibes.", "YTA You stated that he struggles with recognizing social nuances. In order to realize he shouldn't have brought it up in that setting (and some people would it should be revealed in public) he would have to first recognize the implications of a woman being invited over, then have the social skills to tell you in private instead of in public. You say it's just common sense, but it's a sense he explicitly lacks.\nHe didn't cause the drama; the uncle caused it when he had an affair. Don't blame the wrong person", "YTA - Seriously????? Reread what you wrote. How the hell would a 12-year-old with autism be able to parse what's a 'private' adult situation and what isn't? Nor should he have to, he's 12. This is ALL on your BIL. You are just in the huff because your son spoke up while the rest of you were having a nice time. But don't take it out on your son.", "YTA\n\nSo if I understand well, your BIL invited a complete stranger to you and your kids' home without telling you and had an affair with her.\n\nDon't you see how dangerous that could have been? Who is this woman? God knows what she could have done. Your kids could have been in danger! Your BIL was supposed to babysit them. What if one of your kids had an accident while he was getting laid?\n\nI'm actually glad your son spoke about it and I hope that you will have a chat to your BIL about that. The issue is not your son here, the issue is about how your BIL failed as being a responsible adult.\n\nPlease apologize to your son and start to worry about his security", "YTA. How exactly did you think you were going to \u201ckeep the peace?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYes I know you just got devastating news that your husband is a cheater but please finish the dinner first!\u201d \n\nYou sound selfish and awful.", "YTA\n\nThese kids were talking and YOU pressed him to know more and that's when he spilled the beans at the dinner table. So it was you who first forced him to speak up and then punished him for doing so.\n\nAnd even if you didn't press for the truth, why on earth would you punish a child for the betrayal of that uncle? That makes zero sense.\n\nApologize to your son and give him his stuff back.", ">I pressed him\n\nYou\u2019re punishing him for answering your question? YTA", "YTA. You mention in your first paragraph that your son is socially inept and you are working with his therapist about it. It is very common for autistic individuals to have trouble with social situations and not knowing what is appropriate to say, do, etc. for things that most of us find easy to understand. So you already know that he struggles with being in social situations and around others.  He likely didn't know what his uncle was doing was wrong or not normal, which is why he didn't mention it to you. He also told you he didn't know that it was a private matter. It isn't fair to punish him for something he didn't know better about, just because you are frustrated with the fallout and that it led to a family blowout. Use this as a teachable moment and something to discuss with his therapist on how to work towards avoiding this in the future. For his sake, please reconsider giving him any punishments (which were excessively harsh to begin with).", "YTA. In what inept hands this poor kid ended up.", "YTA  your son doesn't understand common sense the way you do, it's not obvious to him. You should definitely explain to him why it wasn't appropriate to speak about such things but punishment isn't fair. His uncle is the biggest AH for bringing his mistress to your house.", "YTA\n\n>I pressed him on what he\u2019s talking about", "YTA. A neurotypical kid his age might not even realize the awkward situation. Aside from that\u2026 his uncle is having an affair and you expect a child to hide that. YTA so hard I can\u2019t even. You\u2019re infantilizing your child due to his disabilities and somehow also blaming him for the behavior of other grown people. This is disgusting.", "YTA. You are punishing your neurodivergent child for an adult's behavior. Your son should not have to pay for the consequences of the adult's poor choices in life.", "YTA - huge punishment for essentially being a kid. Kids tend to blurt things out and not get social cues, even neurotypical ones. He didn\u2019t know it was wrong, and also these matters are important to be talked about- Is the peace of a family dinner relevant if an immense fight breaks AFTERWARDS and the dinner is tense? Also, taking away all of these things is way too much in general for a punishment. He\u2019s not going to tell you anything in the future, which could lead to dangerous situations. I personally think you should rethink it and also have another important discussion with your kid.", "YTA you admit yourself he doesn't know when to and not to bring up things like that yet you punish him anyway. What did you want him to do, just never speak when anyone is around on any holiday because he might by chance say something that could destroy the whole family? Maybe instead work on the type of family you have around you so that he doesn't have anything to say that can destroy it instead. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, you are punishing him because of your own emotions towards the effects of his disability, knowing that this will not to better him in the future. And that makes you a bad parent.", "Yes YTA: 1) he has autism you have said that he lacks social cues to know what is appropriate and what is not to talk about. So for him, it isn't common sense to understand what he did. \n\n2) telling him \"keeping family secrets\" is okay isn't okay. What if he got assaulted by a family member and he thought because you're telling him that you don't bring inappropriate things up to family or family secrets? \n\n3) taking away his phone and Xbox etc is harsh. You took away the items he uses to stimulate, as a parent with a child with autism you should know for children with autism need objects and activities to simulate themselves. As well as kids with ADHD. I think you need to take a class or see someone about how to handle a child with autism for their age group. There is no shame in it, all parents take classes over their children's lives. It's especially important when you have a child with disabilities and you're clearly struggling with handing it from your post.", "YTA. How would a 12 year old, with autism or without know that an uncless affair is meant to be private. \n\nI would be more pissed off with your BIL for  bringing strange women to chill with your kids without you knowing.", "So your kid simply told the truth and you punished him for it ? Right gotcha \n\nDon\u2019t expect your son to tell the truth again \n\nYTA", "YTA all you did was tell your son that keeping the \"peace\" is more important then him. And what's worst is you are in the comments of your posts trying to justify your poor parenting. And yes I read the title of your other post, you obviously do not care about your son. Because if you did you would know that doing something like this will escalate your son's risk of attempting suicide three times the normal amount, because you just destroyed his support network and his faith in his parents. So congratulations, I say you won the worst mother of Thanksgiving this year.", "YTA. YOU asked HIM. Apologize and do better", "I asked a question, got the answer tgen punished the autistic kid for his honest answer.\n\nYea, YTA", "YTA. Why punish him? Also you are teaching him to not tell you when an adult.does something near him or to him. Who the hell cares about dinner being peacefu after finding out about affairs being conducted at your house around your children?", "YTA your son is 12 years old and had trouble with understanding normal social interactions, this social interactions in particular isn't something a 12 year old should have to deal with AT ALL. \n\nYou punished your son for witnessing inappropriate behavior from an adult in your own home. His uncle brought his affair partner to your home around your children. Your son knew this women wasn't his Aunt or family and had no idea what was going on. \n\nSo instead of punishing the GROWN ADULT you take it out on the 12 year old? \n\nThis line right here is the most concerning, \"I chalked it up to common sense.\"\nWhat about this situation at all can be chalked up to \"common sense\" how would a 12 year old understand that his uncle was having an affair? How would he know that his family had no idea this was happening? \n\nYTA for punishing him for asking questions about things that made NO sense to him. You should have asked the uncle to leave and explained things properly to your young impressionable son.", "YTA\n\nFor god sake he is a kid with autism and have problem in speaking in social circle and is still learning... He said what he saw..\n\nYou should have made him understand or a warning was more than enough.. indeed you were too harsh.", "YTA. He\u2019s a kid. It would be different if this was an adult, but he\u2019s a kid. Don\u2019t be mad at him, be mad at his uncle. Gosh. Misplaced anger, much?", ">My son cried and said that he didn\u2019t know the matter was private, and that he wasn\u2019t supposed to say anything. I chalked it up to common sense\n\n\n\n\n\nYou literally know he has autism. One of the main symptoms being not understanding social situations. Explaining to him that he just unintentionally outed an affair and he needs to think hard about timing/location/necessity when thinking about doing things like that are all fine and dandy, but why did you have to stick a punishment onto it? Why can\u2019t you just teach him?\n\n\n\nYTA, be better.", "Yta -- You *were* too harsh on him. It is hard to keep up with and understand adults rules about disclosure when you don't have spectrum and other issues.", "YTA\n\nYou are punishing your son because your brother in law is a jerk and that is awful. \n\nCall up the BIL and yell at him.  \n\nApologize to your son because you are so wrong\n\nAnd quit saying he ruined your peaceful dinner.  He didn't.  You BIL did.   Because he is a cheater. And trash for bringing women to your house. \n\nGet your focus straightened out and be mad at the person you should be angry at \n\nAnd for heaven's sake get over the I just wanted a peaceful dinner.  \n\nSheesh. \n\nYou took that poor child's stuff away for a whole month and I bet he has no idea why you are being ridiculous and just plain cruel because of your dinner. \n\nUgh \ud83d\ude29", "Yta even a child without autism or ADHD would probably mention the same thing as they don't understand the concept of what was actually happening. You're being unreasonable. The adults deserve punishment not your child. Not only were you too harsh but you are also setting a bad example. Terrible parenting choice there op.", "YTA, OP. Your poor son! \n\nHe talked about something that was probably presented to him as perfectly normal and inadvertently revealed that his uncle was being unfaithful.\n\nFirst, a neurotypical child could easily have done that, assuming as kids do that everyone else was also aware of the friendship.\n\nBut mostly, if he has autism you *cannot* assume he's going to effortlessly pick up social cues in the way you mean \"common sense\". That's the whole basis of his neurodiversity. You basically punished him for being autistic, which is desperately unfair.", "YTA how was your child supposed to know that the woman an affair partner? Does he know what that is? In his mind, a random lady is just a random lady. You are punishing the wrong person.  You are embarrassed that your dinner was ruined and you\u2019re taking it out on your son. Your uncle introduced his partner as maybe a friend or something..who is your son to disagree and not believe his uncle?  Him bringing up his sister\u2019s trauma.. did you tell him not to share that information?  Don\u2019t blame your child for this. Moving forward, you can\u2019t assume your child knows what he can or cannot say. You need to tell him that he cannot talk his sister\u2019s trauma on _____ .  I assume if you asked him about his day or how\u2019d it go with uncle babysitting, he would\u2019ve told you about it.", "YTA \n\nThe uncle made it public when he brought a random woman to your house. Why the hell are you trying to protect him and a dinner over your sister and your son?!? \n\nYTA for how your handling your son as well. You acknowledge that he doesn\u2019t take cues very well but then when he says he didn\u2019t realise, you chalk it up to common sense?? Think you need to educate yourself better on supporting your son because your view of the world and common sense is not his and YOU need to change to better communicate and support. Taking his stuff away is not the right way about it and is a shit way punish and control ANY kid if you\u2019re not actually going to help them learn from a mistake and just assert your control.", "No wonder the kid needs therapy. This whole family does YTA", "YTA. He literally told you he didn't know the matter was private. How would he? That type of situation/relationship is wayyy above his comprehension.", "YTA you care more about your dinner being ruined than your son's well being. If anyone is to blame for what happened it is 100% dude who had the affair in the first place. It would be different if you talked to him and asked him to tell you things first instead at dinner with other people, but no you decided to punish him for simply saying what he saw. Even if he wasn't autistic he still probably would have let the cat out of the bag and you would still be TAH for punishing him.", "You\u2019re punishing him after you asked him? It\u2019s private but your brother in law was doing it in front of the kids? You want your son to lie to your face after he was asked? Are you dense? \n\nNo it\u2019s not your kids fault for not lying for an adult, he\u2019s in more trouble than your cheating, lying brother in law. YTA, and a big one, you owe your son an apology for that", "Omg, my heart breaks for your son.\n\nI'm the mother of an autistic child. You cannot punish him for being honest, which is what you have done.\n\nI script situations for my child, and sometimes the repetitive nature means they can follow these, but circumstances arise and due to the autism you cannot punish for not responding in a way that you would which essentially would be to hide this under the carpet and not deal.\n\nWhat warped messages you're sending your child. No wonder he's confused. If private adult matters should remain private then the adult shouldn't have involved the children in these matters! The blame is on the adults here, yet you're scapegoating your child.\n\nYour child is not the same as you. He doesn't see things as you do.

If my parents would punish me for something no matter what, why even bother to tell them? I would lie until I was blue in the face unless someone presented proof.

He\u2019s the middle child of 5 kids. \n\nWe planned our thanksgiving dinner a couple months ahead and invited our relatives over for thanksgiving. My son is very socially inept and doesn\u2019t understand his actions might be considered hurtful, rude or inappropriate and I\u2019m working with his therapist and his school on how to behave in social situations. \n\nTo make a long story short. It started off as a debate with one of his 5 cousins at dinner, and mentioned an unknown woman by name, and when I pressed him on what he\u2019s talking about, he stated that his uncle, which is my sister\u2019s husband brought a random woman in our house when I asked them last minute to look after the kids when I was called to work. I stopped him from speaking any further and knowing this was going to lead to an argument between adults, I had to send all of the kids upstairs to the bedrooms. I tried everything I could to deescalate the situation and keep the peace. I wanted to make sure that any grievances are held off until after dinner. It quickly devolved into screaming matches and crying. \n\nI had no idea he was having affairs and I was mad that he was bringing women in our house with children, and I tried to hold off until after dinner because I was trying to keep it positive. I was really mad and told the uncle he\u2019s not welcome back. \n\nI told my son that private adult matters should be kept private and that he can\u2019t just talk about these things out loud in front of the whole family and all of the children. And he shouldn\u2019t be bringing up sensitive topics(he brought up his sisters personal trauma without permission) at the dinner table. And because he couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut, I took away his Video games, his phone, his computer and tv until the new year. My son cried and said that he didn\u2019t know the matter was private, and that he wasn\u2019t supposed to say anything. I chalked it up to common sense. \n\nI know the affair wasn\u2019t his fault and that wasn\u2019t the problem. The problem was that he discussed the affair publicly and failed to tell me or his dad that his uncle was bringing women in our house which was a month ago. \n\nI feel like I was too harsh on my son. \n\nReddit AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Immediately sending him away before telling him he was wrong, that he shouldn't have said anything, and punishing him on top of it was a real AH move. He is only 12 and with autism and ADHD I'm assuming he might be a \"young\" 12 to boot. From your story he didn't seem to have any idea what that woman's presence meant and I'm going to take a wild guess and assume that you haven't discussed matters like adultery with him previously. Punishing your child for something he doesn't understand is not going to engender a sense of trust in you. \n\nStory:\nWhen I was in the second grade my fingernail got caught in a kid's jersey at school. I showed him how my finger was bleeding by holding up the offending finger and the teacher saw and I had to sit out at recess. None of the adults I asked would explain why I was in trouble so I had to go asking other children, namely my older sister's friends.  That is how I learned what \"F*** you\" was at 7 yrs old. Throughout my childhood and adolescence I continued seeking out my peers for advice instead of my parents and teachers. \n\nMoral of the story: Reevaluate your parenting style. Maybe encouraging a good relationship with your child is more important than telling him he should \"keep his mouth shut\" for the sake of a pleasant dinner.", "Sincerely OP, you having a bad feeling about punishing your son is a GOOD thing. It's never too late to apologize to him, tell him how you messed up, and fix this. Parents aren't perfect, and he shouldn't have brought up his sister's trauma,but the affair thing was out of his control. YTA but you can fix this! He's 12, but it's never too late to change something you've been doing wrong. You might also want to have a talk with other adults/kids that were present if you shamed him. A public grievance deserves a public apology. \n\nIt might also help you to do some research into what AUTISTIC people say about autistic \"treatment\" and therapy. When your son admitted the affair at Thanksgiving the shame of the affair was neither yours nor your son's. His social capacity wasn't responsible for this situation and really had no role in this issue. This could have happened with an allistic or neurotypical child. It would probably do you'd one good to reflect on how you let his autism color your view of him and what you expect of him.", "YTA\n\nYou even admit he has no capacity to evaluate these things himself. What is the point in punishment then?\n\nWould you punish a quadriplegic for failing to pass you the salt?", "YTA. I also have ADHD and am on the spectrum, and I promise you, your son had no idea that bringing up that woman was an \"adult affair\". He had and still has no way to figure that out. There's no checklist, it's intuitive, something we have difficulties with.  I'm 34 and I still miss cues, I still stick my foot so far in my mouth, it comes out the other end. This isn't your son's fault at all. This is all Uncle's fault. Go take his electronics away until next year.", "YTA. While I agree that talking to him about what is and is not appropriate to share is important and a life skill he needs, he literally did not know any better. He did not do this maliciously, and it sounds like he may not have equated the \u201crandom woman\u201d his uncle brought into the house with his uncle having an affair.\n\n(To be honest, I\u2019m also not sure that I agree with your assessment that your son\u2019s actions WERE even inappropriate here. He mentioned this woman by name, and YOU pressed him on who this person was. I feel like holding the \u201cdon\u2019t talk about stuff that could create family drama\u201d line could really backfire, because what if your son doesn\u2019t share something that you should really know about because he fears getting in trouble?)\n\nApologize to your son, and give him his devices back. Your punishing this poor kid for \u201ccreating family drama,\u201d but he didn\u2019t\u2014his uncle did. And common sense becomes common because we\u2019re taught these things.

Sorry but I have a daughter with the very same issues and I would Never expect her to come clean about what her uncle was doing. 1. It's not her responsibility and 2. They don't have that connection in their brain that tells them to do that.  Children like ours don't have \"Common Sense,\" what we consider common sense they deem it as not.

They were being honest, and as a child who according to OP is in therapy for learning about social norms, this is something that they struggle with when it comes to social situations.

I've learned anything from crushes (on me and other kids) to family issues, affairs, what cars do they drive, and most importantly the color & shape of their daily poop...", "This.\nI think OP finds her autistic son to be a trial.", "Not at the dinner table... speak to his wife privately at least and then it should be up to her who to tell.", "This is how children get abused and abusive or cowardly parents cover it up.", "Well apparently OP didn't know so her son just sprung that before dinner. It's not his fault, but there is a time and a place. The time and place was when it happened or very shortly after. And the two older kids probably should have been the ones that told OP.\n\nI don't know if she was covering it up so much as being upset that her holiday was ruined by her brother in law. Then she misplaced the anger at her son.\n\nYTA for punishing him. He should learn when and where to bring that kind of stuff out (and then if it's going to be kept hidden to go spectacularly nuclear or at the very least tell his aunt himself), but it's not his fault that he doesn't understand that kind of nuance. He's 12 and also autistic. This should be a learning experience about moderating himself and finding the correct time to talk about things like that. I don't see any reason to think OP would have covered it up if she knew.", "Same.  At 12, I wasn't sophisticated enough to know that a strange, unnamed woman showing up with a married man is sus.  Maybe I would have been able to put two and two together at 14 or 15.  But at 12, I was still playing with dolls and watching cartoons.\n\nThey call stuff like that \"grown folks business\" for a reason.  Kids aren't supposed to be exposed to that stuff in the first place BECAUSE they lack understanding. OP punished the kid for being a kid.\n\nYTA big time.", "12 is a bit beyond \"kids say the darnedest things\" stage so the neurodivergence is probably relevant, but kid shouldn't be punished for this at all. Mom should try to help him learn the correct time to tell someone this kind of thing and show that she's not mad at him for revealing anything and that she was just upset because people got angry at a party. Make it clear to him that he can come to her with anything and she'll handle it.\n\nShe did not do that. Instead she is showing that telling the truth (albeit in a very public and uncomfortable setting) is just going to get him punished.", "Imagine a man so stupid or blatantly uncaring that he takes his mistress to a house full of kids expecting them to not say anything.\n\nNever going to happen. How is that the kid's fault exactly? Special dinner, you say? He didn't even know Uncle was doing anything wrong so tell me how it's the child's fault.\n\nBiL knew it was wrong. BiL blew up special dinner. Not the child who simply pointed out the obvious.", "Also add to the translation: \"mum who was pissed off at having her hosted thanksgiving dinner and all the effort that went into it ruined by brother in law's behaviour takes it out on poor kid who doesn't know what's going on\"", "*common sense\" is asinine, mostly because it's not common and mostly subjective.", "Richard sighs and attempts to exit the chat.", "It's pronounced BOUQUET!", "Another candlelight dinner ruined by Rose and Daisy.", "Thank you for this. Used to watch this show all the time with my mom when she was alive. Brought Bach good memories.", "What part? I do so love talking about myself \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "The messenger was indeed shot", "No neurotypical twelve year old would retain the info for one month from his parents and then bring it up to the aunt herself.\n\nOP is the asshole for not aknowleding her son's specificities when pzrenting but let's not act like whst he did is typical 12 yo behaviour.", "Im autistic and I definitely would have done this as a child, it wouldn\u2019t even have occurred to me that there was something wrong and if she was in our house why wouldn\u2019t i talk about it with uncle who was there too?", "I have a 16 yo without autism that will call you out in a heartbeat. Not like an affair at the thanksgiving dinner, but more like a lie of omission.", "I was 12 when my mother started her first affair (with my friend\u2019s married dad) and she saw fit to explain to me that affairs are the fault of the wife, because if the husband was getting everything he needed at home, he wouldn\u2019t have to go looking for it elsewhere\u2026", "And even a non-autistic kid wouldn't necessarily know this.\n\nDon't punish kids for an adult fuckup. YTA.", "And there is a good chance if he had mentioned it, he would have been told it was grown folk business.", ">adults aren\u2019t supposed to have friends of the opposite sex if they\u2019re already married/dating someone else\n\nI'm sorry, but, WTAF? What an immature and inaccurate statement. My husband has plenty of friends that are women. My dearest friend is a man. I've known my friend since we were 12 (now 40). He walked my mom down the aisle at my wedding. \n\nAdditionally, same-sex relationships exist. Who are they allowed to be friends with? Can they only have friends of the opposite sex?", "Exactly. This kid was in a no win situation. And I feel for him because she really looks down on him for no reason besides he's autistic.\"cause he couldn't keep his mouth shut\" that's got me furious.", "This. At 12 my married mother (a flight attendant) was routinely taking me on trips to Minneapolis (one of her main hubs), and her pilot \u201cfriend\u201d would regularly be hanging out in our hotel room with her when I went to bed. Wasn\u2019t until I was 14/15 that I realized she had been having an affair with Mr. Pilot. Kids are naive about this stuff at that age.", "Exactly. The biggest thing for me is that ^ he doesn't have the same concept of social skills and regardless, he's twelve. Those two things combined prove he did not say this maliciously. So why punish him??? It's mind-boggling.\n\n\nHe even apologized and said he didn't know it was private or that it would cause such an uproar. \n\nI can't imagine the guilt he must be feeling, because once again, he doesn't understand what's happening, all he knows is something he said caused his family to scream and cry. That ducked up. \n\nOP is a giant YTA.", "Emmett and Elizabeth sip coffee in the privacy of their bungalow.", "Mind the cyclist, Richard!", "Your son doesn't understand common sense the way you do. he doesn't realize it. You should explain to him why it was inappropriate for him to say such things, but the punishment will not be fair. His uncle is the best AH who brought his lover to your house.", "It is beyond irritating to me that people are never mad at the person who did the bad thing, no, all the ire is aimed at the person who pointed it out, completely innocently in this case.", "I'm not autistic and probably still would have casually mentioned it, OP is an AH", "~~imagine calling another person stepmom when your parents aren't even divorced behind the other parent's back. Them not finding out till we accidentally called the stepparents out at the age 6~~", "~~Try going on holidays with a family that we can\u2019t tell Daddy about.~~", "Right, that's... something though. Bless the kids w jack\\*\\*\\* parents", "Wonder what her logic was for married women having affairs, lordy.", "Right! When I was ten - my dad brought a woman who wasn\u2019t my stepmom to my grandmothers one evening. I had friends of the opposite gender that I hung out with and visited so I didn\u2019t think anything of it. 4 years later I find out I have a 4 yr old little brother by that woman and I was *shocked pikachu face*. OP is certainly TA.", "THIS.\n\n1) he did not even know what his was sex thing and thus a secret\n2) it has nothing to do with thw diagnosis\n3) terrible cruel to punish a child\n4) IF THIS CHILD EVER IS ABUSER OR WITNESSED ABUSE HE WILL NEVER TELL ANYONE AFTER THIS\n\nYTA big time.", "It\u2019s not my opinion, I\u2019m being facetious to show how ridiculous OP is acting.", "And the vicar is hiding because he wants no part of this mess.", "Candlelit dinner anyone?", "Also many children would not construe it as private when the uncle was so blatant/brazen about bringing her around.", "I don\u2019t think it was inappropriate for the child to tell something like this. It was inappropriate on side of the uncle. You tell kids to never keep secrets from adults. Because THAT is inappropriate.", "Whats common for one person may not be for another. Lots of people seem to forget that.", "I would say OP\u2019s son has more common sense than she and her husband. Looking at her posting, all she cared was a ruined dinner. Not ruined lives, cheating or anything, just damn dinner.", "This woman doesn\u2019t even have common sense, but has the nerve to be pissed her son didn\u2019t use it. People like her piss me right off.", "Kids absolutely don\u2019t completely understand \u201ccommon sense\u201d because what is common varies by household. The definition I used with second graders (7) was \u201c so,etching so obvious no one should have to tell you.\u201d So with a 12 YO with Autism who has significant issues understanding what that means, they have no idea. Especially since the uncle did this so often it was common place! YTA, OP. Give that child back his things and tell him to tell mommy next time in private next time so you can work out together whether it is public stuff. Then tell him you\u2019re glad he confided in you and you are here to listen to him and help him grow.", "u/PlanesTravels stole this comment from u/spikeymist\n\n[link to original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zevowr/aita_for_punishing_my_son_for_bringing_up_private/iz8re88/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)", "it just really bothers me because as someone who grew up autistic and did a lot of stuff like this in a completely well meaning way but then getting punished for it\u2026 it really fucks you up, and as an adult now i have so much fear going into any social situation that i\u2019ll do something like that and get in trouble, if you know your kid is autistic and struggles with these things i can\u2019t understand why you would punish him?? Why can\u2019t you sit him down and explain \u201cwe try not to say or do these things because sometimes they can hurt people\u2019s feelings, so let\u2019s try and be aware of that in the future.\u201d", "\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffb", "In another comment, OP says her son thought the woman was a cousin.

The drama falls squarely on the uncle and no one else.  Dad/OP needs to sit the son down asap and apologize, including explaining why he did what he did, he was embarrassed and mistakenly placed an emphasis on the wrong thing, trying to keep the peace over honesty and return all items removed.  If the other kids know they should be included in this apology to ensure they understand this mistake lands squarely on OP\u2019s lap and uncle was the person who did the wrong thing.  Anything other than this is a parenting fail.  Kids need to learn parents make mistakes and make things right when they realize it.", "Agreed. And dangerous.
