It was completely unexpected, and has been hell to navigate. \n\nHis girlfriend (25F now) and him were never engaged, married, or even living together. She is a lovely girl, and was very helpful to my family and I while we were navigating the first bit of life without him. The problem was she would never stop talking about HOW he passed. Any and every conversation we had, she always brought up how we lost him.\n\nFast forward to August 2022. It just got worse. She would call herself a widow, which bugged me and my brother (the late brother\u2019s twin) and our parents. My parents and brother ended up distancing themselves from her, but I kept her at arm\u2019s length so she didn\u2019t feel alienated. I talked to my therapist about setting some boundaries with her, just about how I didn\u2019t want to always talk about his passing. She seemed to take it quite well and was very understanding.\n\nHowever, two days later, she posted a meme on her story that said \u201cLittle Miss Dead Boyfriend\u201d. My parents saw this and bawled, my brother saw it and was furious, and I was in disbelief. I had friends that followed her texting me and saying she was totally in the wrong for that. \n\nI talked to her about it, and at first she apologized. Then, she deflected. She ended up telling me her grief was worse than mine because, and I quote, \u201cher grief was worse than mine because at least I got to know him my whole life.\u201d I told her I needed time, but my family and I would appreciate it if she just stopped talking about his passing.

I'm baffled. Yes, everyone processes pain in their own way, and sometimes that means distancing yourself from people who keep ripping off the scabs and pouring salt in the wounds.\n\nShe doesn't deserve your inclusion anymore. Pain sucks, I get it. But my partner is on the way out the door and if I ever pulled this shit, I hope his mom gives me the firm slap I'd deserve for making his death about me.\n\nHow dare she claim her pain is worse than yours? It's not a competition!", "NTA. At first I wanted to ask how long they were together (because if it was really long time, even if they never lived together, her grief could still be enormous), but then I read the rest and she just sounds unhinged! \"Little Miss Dead Boyfriend\"??? She sounds like the kind of self-centered, diabolical person who would take glamour shots at a concentration camp. Block her and be well rid of her.", "NTA \n\n> \u201cher grief was worse than mine because at least I got to know him my whole life.\u201d \n\nI think that makes it worse? You have more memories, you spent more time together, you grew up together. A person who was a big part of your life since you were born is now gone. It\u2019s not easy to deal with. Her grief matters, too. But the way she is going about it is insensitive. Grief isn\u2019t a contest of who has the ability to grieve more. \n\nShe has every right to be devastated, but she is in the wrong for saying that her grief is worse. You went about things the right way. \n\nI know what it\u2019s like to lose a sibling. I hope you\u2019re doing okay.", "NTA\n\n>\u201cher grief was worse than mine because at least I got to know him my whole life.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of weird backwards logic is that? Usually the longer you know someone, the worse it hurts to lose them, not the other way around.", "NTA. I have a very hard time with anybody who claims their grief is bigger than anybody else's. I have known people who made those claims and those people had clinically diagnosed personality disorders.\n\nI'm not saying your late brother's gf has a personality disorder, but because the behavior is toxic you are well within your rights to set boundaries here. I think the best boundary is to limit contact/block her on social media for a long while, so her centering her identity around your brother's loss does not negatively impact you.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nShe lacks the introspection to see how her behavior is hurting you and your family. Also, the bit about how \"her grief was worse than mine because at least I got to know him my whole life\" is a take so bad it's fucking comical. She really thinks that the short period she dated your brother formed a stronger relationship between the two of them than you and he developed over a lifetime of being siblings??\n\nIn my opinion, if you want to cut her out of your life entirely for the sake of your mental and emotional health you are totally justified.", "NTA - But you need to block her. You cannot control what she says/posts - but you can block her number/social media.", "NTA. You sound like a very conscientious person. You\u2019ve tried for over a year now to set boundaries with her. I know it can be hard not to feel guilty, but you don\u2019t owe her anything.\n\nAnd please unfollow/block so you aren\u2019t gut punched every time she posts something.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s making his passing about herself. That\u2019s pretty inconsiderate, at the very least. \n\nIt\u2019s not just her boyfriend who passed. He was a real person and she\u2019s capitalizing on it for attention.", "NTA - block this girl, on everything, and move on.  Stop having anything to do with her.  All she does is drag all of you down, why are you doing this to yourselves?", "NTA. \n\nGrieving collectively happens in different social layers. \nThe core is the departed person and innermost circle are the people closest to them. Then you move outwards through layers until in the outer most layers you have distant acquaintances. \n\nEverybody grieves differently, but when you lean on someone or express your grief in a manner that could bother others, you need to do that outwardly. Always toward the next outer layer. Toward people a bit less involved. \nOnly onto each other in the same layer, when the feeling is mutual. And never, ever inward. \n\nEven before the social media misstep, she neglected to respect this and leaned onto the innermost unit, your parents, constantly, even after being told to stop. \nEven if she is inside that innermost circle with your family, she can't lean on you constantly, and she can't experiment with gallows humor in a way that would hurt you.", "NTA- Absolutely NTA! How tone dead you gotta be to post that, especially after being told to stop bringing up his passing. Along with the \"im a widow.\" Yikes... An to gaslight you for being reasonably being upset is disgusting. Cut her off, your family is not gonna heal with this girl around.", "NTA. Yes we all grieve differently. Your way of grieving is to stop discussing it with her. She went way too far, calling herself a widow. I am one and it's not okay for her to make this claim.", "NTA\n\nnot.one.bit\n\nmy condolences on your loss. \n\nshe's looking for attention. and using your deceased brother's passing is apparently the attention grabber she was looking for. \n\nhonestly you should just go no contact. so should your parents. she has issues.", "NTA and your friends are right you definitely were to nice but that\u2019s good on you cause if I were you I would have lost my mind on her calling her names and telling her no her grief wasn\u2019t worse she was just some chick he was sleeping with. Your grief it 1000 times worse", "NTA\n\nEveryone handles grief in their own way. With that being said- you also have to be conscious of the others grieving around you as well.\nYou and your family have been more than accommodating. And it's time to let her go.", "NTA attention seeking and drama is not ok while you and your family mourns she needs help and it can\u2019t be from you end this sad toxic relationship.", "I'm not passing judgement. Grief is a strange weird journey. We can't gate keep grief. When we lose someone we love, other people do too. Sometimes it can be healing and helpful, other times it just makes us rage filled. There's a possibility she's playing it up for attention (I call it grief stalking) and using his death.  Or... she is actually extremely upset and stuck in the stages.  Here's the thing. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if shes faking it or if shes grieving super hard. Grief is a journey and we do get to pick the people that go on the journey with us. She can't be one of those people for you and your family. You should let her know you wish her well but you have to stop speaking to her due to your own mental health. I would then block her from everything. She will be OK. She will find her own people. \n\nI say all this because I lost my best friend two months ago. I've had random people coming out of the wood work to talk to me that barely knew her. I dont engage with them. For my own mental health I can't be around any of that. They just make me furious and I can't waste my energy on it.", "NTA. I'm all for people grieving in their own way, but not if it's this damaging to others. Putting out public posts for your family to see and minimizing your grief in the process is not okay in any way. You and your family should block contact with her.", "NTA. You need to go no contact with Little Miss Main Character Syndrome.", ">However, two days later, she posted a meme on her story that said \u201cLittle Miss Dead Boyfriend\u201d.\n\nINFO: Why are you still following her on social media?", "NTA for telling her you're uncomfortable with hearing about it,  but you would be if you said she couldn't talk about it anymore at all. Also,  I'm very sorry for your loss.  I imagine it's not and easy thing to forget. \n\nI have questions. Was it her first relationship? How long were they dating? Them not being married or living together is kind of irrelevant.  I have a friend who was dating a person for less than a year and he died within that year in a very tragic way also.  She still celebrates the anniversary of his birthday with his family and it's been almost 15 years.  It's still hard to process. \n\nHer post on social media though makes it seems like she's used his death to have a new identity.  Widow.  If that's the case,  that's a little more on the odd side.  I hope she can see a therapist to help her through her grief which seems to have had a big impact on her life.", "NTA.  Bluntly, I've got to ask why you're still trying to be in contact with her at all.  Your parents have noped out.  Your brother has noped out.   It sounds like the only reason you still have any sort of a relationship with her is out of guilt.   But hey, she's not talking to you so now would be a good time for you to nope out as well.", "I\u2019m speaking as a widow so I know the grief all too well. That grief is indeed different for me and my husband\u2019s family. I hate the word \u201cwidow\u201d, I use it as little as possible but that\u2019s just me. She obviously hasn\u2019t moved on and needs help doing so, I mean professional help. You\u2019re NTA but neither is she. Try to convince her to get the help she needs and distance yourself from her. I wouldn\u2019t say block her number or anything like that because, after all you and your family are the ones who suffered the same loss and she might feel you\u2019re the only people who understand her. Another thing is if she was with him when he passed because that\u2019s another trauma. I was doing CPR on my husband with MIL and that\u2019s a nightmare the two of us share and will never go away. Your brother and his girlfriend were both young and she probably doesn\u2019t have the coping mechanisms someone with more life experience would have. I was 37 when I became a widow and a single mom and almost a year later I still haven\u2019t had a good night sleep.\nBottom line NTA but get her some help.", "I'm going with NAH- I'm really sorry for the loss of your brother. Extending my condolences to you and the rest of your family. \n\nNow while I do think that meme she posted was a bit tone deaf everyone deals with grief in their own way. I would just go NC with her and unfollow/block her social medias. That way you don't have to speak to her anymore or see her posts, problem solved.", "NTA. I am so, so very sorry for your loss. I lost my brother 20 years ago and I\u2019m honestly still grieving and think of him every single day. I\u2019ve lost close friends and both my parents, but nothing hit me like losing my brother.", "Nta but you really need to work on your wording (the title made you look bad at first)", "YTA\n\nYou're right grief is different for everyone, so you don't get to tell her how to express hers. If you can't be around it, all of you just block her on all platforms and cut contact.", "Hmmm I can't really say YTA or NTA for you,  but I can say that she is an asshole for creating an entire identity and personality based on your brothers passing. \n\nIt is weird and also devalues her own merit and thoughts of herself. \n\nI am sorry for your loss.", "NAH no one can say how to grieve. Clearly she is processing in her own way as are you and your family. Just bc she wasn\u2019t married to him doesn\u2019t mean anything. Also we are lacking a bunch of info. here. \n\nMy mom was there and performed cpr on my dad when he died. She knew he was dead and did what 911 told her despite knowing he was gone. That alone was a very different trauma than what I experienced with his death. So imo this can\u2019t be properly judged without more info.\n\nEdit. In to on.", "NAH. I may be being generous to her, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. However, everyone processes grief differently. If her way of processing is incompatible with yours then it's totally fine to get some space from that and look after your own mental health/grieving process first. In an emergency you put on your own life jacket first before helping others. Same with mental health. It sounds like you were very kind and understanding, but don't feel selfish for looking after yourself and your family. You lost a brother, that's a big deal. Big hugs and empathy \u2764\ufe0f", "NAH. Everyone grieves differently. She isn\u2019t grieving wrong and neither are you. If her grieving process is difficult for you it\u2019s okay to distance yourself from it/her. Losing someone important to you is always incredibly difficult and grief can make you crazy, so I don\u2019t really think either of you are assholes for how your emotions are.", "Soft YTA because my heart breaks for you\u2026 but you CANNOT tell people how to grieve. It\u2019s okay to set boundaries for yourself (\u201cwhen we speak I\u2019m not comfortable rehashing how he passed\u201d) however you have no right to tell her what to post about her grief. \n\nBeing engaged or married doesn\u2019t give someone more of right to grieve. Stop it with the competitive grief game.", "YTA.\n\nYou don't get to police someone else's grief process. She considers herself a widow, and posts memes about *losing her frickin' boyfriend.* She is allowed to do that. She doesn't need to censor herself because other people lost him, too.", "YTA.

It's about attention.", "Precisely. NTA.", "Perhaps reframing your view of \u201cvictim olympics\u201d to \u201cdifferent people have different psychological limitations when it comes to stress\u201d \n\nThe two griefs that are in the post are both valid, both tragic, and while OP has no responsibility to have the gf in their life, if someone looks like they\u2019re doing something for attention THEY GENERALLY NEED ATTENTION FROM SOMEWHERE (attention seeking behaviours are exactly what they\u2019re called- it\u2019s a cry for emotional aid, a way to compartmentalize and process what your psyche is stressed on. It saddens me to see continued over simplification of human behaviours)", "They were together for less than a year.", "To put it in perspective, but not at all dismiss or condone it, the \"Little miss\" memes were a dark humor coping trend that people who went to major trauma were using to connect with each other on tiktok.\n\n It was like two weeks worth of random stranger's Little Miss Dead Parents, Little Miss Lost Everything in a House Fire, Little Miss 16 Miscarriages, Little Miss Dead Husband, etc popping up on my for you page, and I'm someone who didn't interact with them and scrolled away as soon as I realized what I was looking at. With the missing context I think she's just hella misguided and in need of grief therapy big time. The whole family needs to unfollow her though at minimum", "This is the best comment. She\u2019s being very insensitive towards the family. That line about her grieve being worse is just a horrifically cruel thing to say to his sister. \n\nThe girlfriend needs to realise that while she lost someone very important, that she loved, she is not the only one who lost him. It\u2019s not about her, it\u2019s about him. She needs to be sensitive about that.", "I love this.  I'd heard it before, but had forgotten about it.  I almost wish funeral homes gave out this diagram.", "As messed up as it sounds, I didn\u2019t want to unfollow her and make him disappointed. Everything I do in life is in his honor now. I felt like if I cut her out, he would\u2019ve been so hurt.", "It was not her first relationship. They were together for less than a year.", "I kept talking to her because I didn\u2019t want to let my late brother down. He was my best friend, and if this was someone he loved, the last thing I would want to do would be to hurt someone he loved. You\u2019re right though, since we haven\u2019t talked since August, it might be time.", "The girlfriend is claiming her grief is worse. That\u2019s rude and uncalled for. Yes, people grieve differently, but comparing her grief to theirs is bullshit. NTA.", "The ex was the one who compared grief, even stating that hers was worse! OP is only asking that she not make such a ridiculously public show of her grief, especially talking about HOW her brother died. It's called common fucking decency.", "She\u2019s not saying how the girlfriend is allowed to grieve. She\u2019s asking the girlfriend to be sensitive towards his family, which the girlfriend is not being. Telling your boyfriend of less than a year\u2019s sister that your grief is worse than hers, is an insanely horrific thing to say.", "Yeah I\u2019m a widower before 30, and r/widowers we would accept her in the sub, because grief is still similar for any form of SO.  This is common issue, some people want to talk about it a lot, some want to never mention it again.  It\u2019s difficult to wrap my mind around why they care so much if she calls herself a widow. To me that is her expressing how she feels, she feels like she lost a partner she loved. This is totally an ESH situation to me. I\u2019m\nnot friends with my former in-laws on social, and we get along great, just unfollow her if her posts trigger you.", "They\u2019re also just not comparable griefs imo, loss of a sibling vs loss of a romantic partner are vastly different experiences that straight up shouldn\u2019t be pitted as \u201cwhat is worse\u201d", "OMG. She's truly psychotic then.", "NTA. She is attention seeking and using this tragedy to do it, the meme proved that.", "Yea dude, don't feel bad. She's just milking it for attention. She sounds like a complete nut.", "OMG", "What the actual\u2026 NTA!!!", "NTA. Block her on everything. And stay the heck away from her.", "Yeah this solidifies it. NTA I was going to see how she was managing her grief and it sounds like she's not managing, she utilizes it for attention", "Especially that they were together less than a year, so her grief is more than his sister because the sister had more time with him???   Girl is attention seeking at this point.  She\u2019s completely psychotic", "Sounds like you need to consider grief counselling.  Do you really believe your late brother would have wanted you all to be put through this?", "You may not be able to control how she talks, but you absolutely control whether you listen. Which is worse: telling her to shut up or letting her go through whatever she's going through without it bothering you?", "Sounds like, if he had seen how she's behaving to you, and how she's using his death to get pity for herself and even telling outright lies about their relationship, calling herself a widow, that he might well have decided to drop the relationship with her, because she's, well, not acting like someone healthy here.\n\nIf your brother loved you, wouldn't he want you to put your needs first, not keeping someone in your life that isn't actually honoring him at all?  **This girl isn't honoring him, to lie and call herself his widow, to post things like this.  She's hurting your whole family when she does these things.**  Are you sure that your brother wouldn't find it more honoring to himself, for you to let go of a relationship with a person that is *using* his memory, not honoring his memory?", "The best thing you can do is cut her off. She's exploiting your brother for likes and internet clout. You can preserve his honour by not letting it be tainted by her deranged attention-grabbing nonsense.", "I know how attached one can get in a first relationship,  which is why I asked about that.  Less than a year,  I still understand it being hard,  seeing my own friends go through it in her early 20s. \n\nI still say you're NTA and she probably needs therapy", "Under a year of dating she is truly unhinged. She was only dating him and over that time probably on saw him a couple hundred hours. While, you her family knew him his whole life. If someone made my mum cry like that, I would tear her a new one.\nSo sorry for your loss and block her.\nI am a widow and I hate using that word.", "I think it is very likely he would have broken up with her by now. You can separate yourself from this lunatic.", "And OP didn\u2019t do that this entire post? There\u2019s also a lot of missing info and context, in my opinion, so it\u2019s hard to grasp a real understanding of what and how everything went down.", "She is definitely an asshole by having a \"grief-off\". \n\nEveryone lost someone important to them, and both parties need to leave the other to handle their grief in their own way.\n\nThe question about time together is moot. No one says to a parent, \"well, you only had him for less than a year\" if they lose a child. You can get incredibly close to someone in a short period of time.", "Truly does not meet the characteristics of a psychotic disorder. Sounds like u are trying to say irrational / inappropriate, vastly different things.", "Attention seeking behaviour is often a cry for help (it\u2019s literally called \u201cattention seeking\u201d)", "This concept that the meme was in poor taste doesn\u2019t seem to understand the mass amount of people who use humour to cope with trauma? I think it\u2019s funny and a jab at herself (as everyone is saying she won\u2019t shut up about it)", "I see your point about the time, but since the girlfriend is definitely using time to measure who\u2019s worse off, I\u2019d say OP as his sister would win the grieve-off since she\u2019s been in his life forever and the girlfriend only knew him for less than a year. That\u2019s why I mentioned it, because the girlfriend seems to focus on that. But you\u2019re right, it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nI just hope the girlfriend allows OP to grieve her brother in peace, without her drama.", "Yes but she is directly brining more grief to the family with her behavior. She needs therapy and to let the family grieve.", "On that, I think everyone in this thread can agree!\n\nAnd OP, I am very sorry for your loss."]}
