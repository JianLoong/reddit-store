He eats when he's hungry, bored, or just feels like it. My mother and I both label our food so he doesn't eat it.\n\nA few nights ago, I went out with a few friends and got some food with them at Olive Garden. I got the lasagna fritta (12$) and chicken tortellini alfredo (23$), which I paid for. All of my friend paid for their own food as well. I couldn't finish the alfredo, so I got a takeout box, as well as a breadstick bag and salad box. When I got home, I wrote my name on the takeout box and the salad box, but told Dallas and my mother they could have the breadsticks. I specifically told Dallas he could only have the breadsticks and not the salad or alfredo.\n\nDallas and our mother had already left by the time I woke up. I was planning on taking the alfredo and salad to work for lunch, but when I looked for the boxes in the fridge, they weren't there. I text my mom asking if she knew where they were, and she said no. I text Dallas if he knew where my food went, but he left me on read. I then made a ham and cheese sandwich and left for work.\n\nWhen I got home, Dallas had already gotten home from school. I went to throw away the leftovers of my sandwich (only part of the crust) and saw the Olive Garden boxes in there. I went to Dallas's room and asked him why he took my food and he said he didn't want to eat his school's food so he took mine. I told him that since he wanted to eat my food, which I paid for with the money I earned from working, then he'd have to pay me 30$. He told me that he didn't have any money nor did he want to pay me. I left him alone, but only after telling him he owes me the money and I won't forget.\n\nApparently, he complained to our mother, because when she got home, she told me I was being unreasonable and that Dallas is a teenager so he needs to eat a lot. I reminded her I told him he couldn't eat the alfredo or salad and she said \"he has a bad memory\". My mother said I was an adult and he wasn't, so I should ask for an apology, not money. I refused and she called me stubborn before going to her room.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667163422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhpp9a/aita_for_telling_my_brother_if_he_wants_to_eat_my/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
