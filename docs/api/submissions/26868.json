Adolf was a popular name at one point too but if someone told me they were naming their baby adolf I wouldn\u2019t be their friend any longer.", "yeah, it's pronounced Loo-fee.", "Omg, so not only is it a stupid name for a human, but they will spend their life correcting people about the pronunciation.", "it's absolutely worse. Not only will that kid have a stupid name, they'll have to explain to everyone ... for the rest of their life... that they're saying it wrong.", "Yeah. Loo-fee.", "The whisper-shouted full first + middle name combo... oof, my shoulders go up just thinking about hearing my mom drop that one.", "I\u2019m not saying that the majority of people will get it, but there will be a LOT that will. And odds are that those in the know will share the knowledge with people who don\u2019t. Cue awkward inorganic conversation for demonstrative purposes:\n\nClueless: \u201cDebbie and Brian just had their baby last night!\u201d\nClued in: \u201cHow wonderful. What name have they chosen?\u201d\nClueless: \u201cit\u2019s a little unusual, they named him Zurg. Must be a cultural name\u201d\nClued in: \u201coh my god they did not name their baby *Zurg* ahaha I am laughing in disbelief and morbid delight at this tragedy\u201d\nClueless: \u201cwhy are you laughing? That\u2019s so rude. They probably put a lot of thought into that name!\u201d\nClued in: \u201cZurg is the evil emperor from Toy Story, and Buzz Lightyear\u2019s nemesis\u201d\nClueless:\u201dyou\u2019re not serious? Who would name their baby after an evil cartoon robot that isn\u2019t even a main character of their franchise?\u201d\nClued in: \u201cDebbie and Brian, clearly\u201d.\nNow also clued in: \u201cthat poor kid. Good luck Zurg\u201d", "Doesn\u2019t really make much difference, that\u2019s not the association most people will make. Also it\u2019s not really the sort of conversation your kid would appreciate having, \u201care you named after Jiraiya the folk legend, or Jiraiya the pervert anime character?\u201d\n\nI have an unusual name myself, and even just dealing with pronunciation during intros is a pain.", "I dreaded starting One Piece, my completed watch list is at the 400s, couldn't reasonably avoid it any longer. 543 episodes in and im a fan, helps that my boyfriend loved it before I even started it", "If you don't mind cutesie or romance animes may I recommend:  \nSmile Down the Runway  \nSnow White with the Red Hair  \nArte  \nSacrificial Princess(is currently airing)  \nSugar Apple Fairy Tale(currently airing)  \n\n\nAn absurd anime: Wiseman's Grandchild.  \n\n\nWe are also liking My Happy Marriage on Netflix.", "There's always OnePace that skips the fillers.", "You can watch 2 episodes and then skip 2-3 and not miss anything.", "Well he\u2019s a DJ so I guess it works out for him lmao", "Thank you. I also thought it was pronounced like \u2018fluffy\u2019. Appreciate the help", "Somehow that makes it worse.", "Oh gosh I wasn't saying it to defend it as a name choice lol. The folk legend is an even  worse person than the anime character!", "Ahahaha so it\u2019s a terrible choice from every angle then \ud83d\ude02"]}
