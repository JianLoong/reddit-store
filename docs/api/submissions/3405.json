I also recently fell down the stairs and really injured my foot. I was wearing a boot, so on top of my invisible disability, I was also visibly disabled.\n\nOn the way home, we had a four hour drive before rushing through the airport and dragging ourselves onto the plane. By the time I got into my seat, I was dizzy, brain foggy, exhausted, and my foot was in unbearable pain. I could barely stand. We unpack our things and settle into our seats, so relieved to be done.\n\nA couple boards the plane with a cat in a carrier and sits in the first row. After a while, the flight attendant tells them that they cannot have a pet in a carrier in first row because there is no seat to put it under. She asks the couple if one could switch to a different seat with the cat, and the couple starts to argue that they want to sit together.\n\nThe flight attendant comes and asks us to switch with them. There was an empty seat directly behind the couple and at least ten other people directly around us, and we're in the third row back on the other side. We said no politely and explained that I'm disabled. I explained that it took a lot to get to my seat, I boarded early for extra time, and that I was in so much pain that I didn't want to get up again. The flight attendant goes back to arguing with the couple before returning and insisting that we move. She didn't bother to ask anyone else to move.\n\nI'm typically the most accommodating person, but the trip had taken literally everything out of me and I was so absolutely done. So I again politely said no. The couple and the flight attendant both made a nasty face. The fight attendant proceeded to tell us that we would HAVE to give up our seats if they couldn't find someone else willing to switch. \n\nI'm not a confrontational person, so I just told her that this was not an appropriate way to treat disabled customers. The couple could sit one behind the other or someone else could give up their seat, but I wouldn't be moving from the seat I paid for. \n\nShe continued to argue with me and tell me that I would have more room for my foot if I moved. I told her that I had plenty of room as I have short legs, and that I would rather not have to gather all of my belongings and walk dizzy/painfully to another seat just to have extra room I didn't need when the couple could simply split up.\n\nEventually, the woman next to the empty seat agreed to switch so the couple could sit together. But by that point, I was so angry, and the couple and the flight attendant were openingly glaring at us. She was fairly rude the rest of the flight. \n\nAs a people pleaser, the whole situation left me feeling bad. I hate not being accommodating. But it wasn't my fault the airline allowed them to book the first row with a pet carrier nor that they refused to split up.\n\nAITA for not giving up our seats so the couple with the cat could sit together??", "created_utc": 1669590827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6fvm9/aita_for_not_giving_up_our_seats_on_a_plane_just/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Complain to the airline. A LOT. This is hugely unacceptable. Also, as someone who has traveled with an in-cabin pet (tiny dog that I paid for - not a Service dog), there are fees and rules about having the pet on the plane. If they allowed the couple to bring the pet on in a bulkhead/no underseat space seat, that is fully the airline\u2019s fault.", "Stop justifying it. You're NTA.

Don't stay silent. Women are taught from a young age in some form or another to bend over backwards not to be \"a Karen\" and it's bullshit. They were willing to literally physically hurt you just because they can.", "NTA. As someone who's had an invisible disability since I was 19, I understand how much travel takes out of you and how horrible people can treat you when they don't understand or believe the extent of your disability. The couple should have known the rules for traveling with a cat carrier and booked their seats accordingly. The fact that you were visibly disabled this time just makes the flight attendant's treatment of you even more egregious. I'm not usually confrontational either, but your comment about how they treat their disabled customers was perfect and should have shut the flight attendant up. Good job standing up for yourself!", "NTA-. Also put the airline and flight attendant on blast.  Call and complain to customer service and let them know that you will be speaking to Department of Transportation\u2019s Aviation Consumer Protection Division (ACPD).  and filing an ada (Americans with disabilities) complaint with them.  (As you can see I'm petty and I would totally do this....in fact I have done this.)", "NTA. I am SOO glad you did not budge. You shouldn't have had to. Please do report this to the carrier. You may not have the attendant's name, but with the flight info, they will know who was working. I would tell them that you expect (1) a letter of apology from that flight attendant, (2) the word of a manager that the attendant receives specific training on how to talk to passengers and what she can and cannot demand of them and under what circumstances. You may even ask for more (a perk if you chose to fly them again). I'm sorry that apparently no other passengers spoke up and told the attendant to stop treating you that way.", "NTA\n\nIn an age where we can select our seats online when we book our flights, you are not required to give up your seats. The flight attendant has an obligation to ask others to switch, but you do not have to agree\u2014not for a family who wants to sit together, not for a kid who wants to sit by the window, and certainly not for a cat carrier couple who booked seats in the front row.\n\nThat being said, there is a little extra room in that first row, and sometimes allowing someone (like a person with really long legs) the aisle seat or a switch for a nervous person seated next to the emergency doors is a welcome courtesy. So, I hope you weren\u2019t digging in simply because someone expected you to cave. \n\nThat flight attendant should have put her energy into solving the problem in a different way and not throwing shade your way when you didn\u2019t jump at the chance to give Fluffy and her parents your seat. \n\nHopefully, the flight when smoothly once you got in the air. \u2708\ufe0f", "NTA and you must lodge an official complaint.", "NTA what is it with adults insisting they sit together on a plane when it inconveniences others.
