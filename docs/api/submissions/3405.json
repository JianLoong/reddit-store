I also recently fell down the stairs and really injured my foot. I was wearing a boot, so on top of my invisible disability, I was also visibly disabled.\n\nOn the way home, we had a four hour drive before rushing through the airport and dragging ourselves onto the plane. By the time I got into my seat, I was dizzy, brain foggy, exhausted, and my foot was in unbearable pain. I could barely stand. We unpack our things and settle into our seats, so relieved to be done.\n\nA couple boards the plane with a cat in a carrier and sits in the first row. After a while, the flight attendant tells them that they cannot have a pet in a carrier in first row because there is no seat to put it under. She asks the couple if one could switch to a different seat with the cat, and the couple starts to argue that they want to sit together.\n\nThe flight attendant comes and asks us to switch with them. There was an empty seat directly behind the couple and at least ten other people directly around us, and we're in the third row back on the other side. We said no politely and explained that I'm disabled. I explained that it took a lot to get to my seat, I boarded early for extra time, and that I was in so much pain that I didn't want to get up again. The flight attendant goes back to arguing with the couple before returning and insisting that we move. She didn't bother to ask anyone else to move.\n\nI'm typically the most accommodating person, but the trip had taken literally everything out of me and I was so absolutely done. So I again politely said no. The couple and the flight attendant both made a nasty face. The fight attendant proceeded to tell us that we would HAVE to give up our seats if they couldn't find someone else willing to switch. \n\nI'm not a confrontational person, so I just told her that this was not an appropriate way to treat disabled customers. The couple could sit one behind the other or someone else could give up their seat, but I wouldn't be moving from the seat I paid for. \n\nShe continued to argue with me and tell me that I would have more room for my foot if I moved. I told her that I had plenty of room as I have short legs, and that I would rather not have to gather all of my belongings and walk dizzy/painfully to another seat just to have extra room I didn't need when the couple could simply split up.\n\nEventually, the woman next to the empty seat agreed to switch so the couple could sit together. But by that point, I was so angry, and the couple and the flight attendant were openingly glaring at us. She was fairly rude the rest of the flight. \n\nAs a people pleaser, the whole situation left me feeling bad. I hate not being accommodating. But it wasn't my fault the airline allowed them to book the first row with a pet carrier nor that they refused to split up.\n\nAITA for not giving up our seats so the couple with the cat could sit together??", "created_utc": 1669590827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6fvm9/aita_for_not_giving_up_our_seats_on_a_plane_just/", "score": 1104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I was so anxious knowing there are people out there unwilling to entertain a polite request because they think my poor planning is the reason (this does my apply to OP\u2019s situation)", "I hope you got the flight attendant\u2019s name. This was wildly inappropriate. NTa", "NTA. as many have said, please contact the airline and publicly let everyone know what happened to you. Her treatment of you was completely unacceptable. I had a boot and know how hard it it\u2019s to navigate the cramped quarters of a plane. Airlines won\u2019t change and that flight attendant will get away with her awful behavior if you let this go. \nAlso, most airlines require you to call ahead and confirm availability for any pet flying. They shouldn\u2019t have been able to book the front row. Sounds like they did a last minute thing but how they were still able to still check in a pet and have a front row seat is sus. Good for you, standing your ground.", "I'm pretty sure op was referencing a bulkhead seat, not an exit row", "If I was travelling with a cat I would not be letting him/her out of my sight. But I would absolutely be prioritising the cat and ensuring that I was in a suitable seat for the cat, rather than kicking up a stink about this 'we HAVE to sit together' bullsh*t. Cats find travelling distressing and that won't be helped by hearing the owners have a stressful conversation, they react to that sort of thing. Sitting apart for one flight is just not an issue unless there is a specific reason why one partner needs additional support.", "Nta. You need to report the employee, she was out of line!", "NTA without even reading. You don\u2019t have to give up your seat if you don\u2019t want to. People need to go on the flight that allows them to sit together and if there aren\u2019t any seats together and you still want that flight suck it up if no one wants to switch. You made your choice live with it.", "Wtf. The flight attendant demanded you move, when the couple was the one with the problem? Please post on twitter, Facebook, TikTok and everywhere. Speak up for the disabled. NTA", "NTA.  talk about that flight attendant with the airline\u00b4s customer service", "NTA and I would be lodging a formal complaint. That\u2019s absolutely BS.", "NTA and congrats for holding your ground and not letting the flight attendant intimidate you. It takes considerable time and money to reserve certain seats so it feels like extortion when someone tries to bully their way into a more costly seat.", "I cosign this advice", "NTA 100 percent this.", "No, it was a regular plane. It was a busy, but not full flight, leaving from Denver. And there was a row with six seats (three on either side) behind the couple. We were in the row behind that one on the opposite side from them. There were certainly other people that could have been asked or offered switched. Thankfully that kind woman eventually did.", "She never actually yelled. She argued with us at length despite saying no several times. \n\nAnd I understand your perspective. To clarify, I have bad social anxiety, which is why the situation was so uncomfortable and why I waited to ask before filling a case. Hearing from commenters that not speaking up may allow her to do this to others is why I'm going to report it. When people do stuff like this to me, I usually just let it go. Sadly, it happens more often than able-bodied people would assume. If I made a stink every time someone treated me differently or rudely because of my condition, I would be awfully busy. And I just don't always have the energy to fight it.", "name and shame ***everywhere***\n\nyes yes\n\nthis is the way", "Then get some free flights by complaining", "He \"paid the overvalue anyway\" because if he didn't, as he agreed to, the courts would have forced him to, plus penalties and millions of not tens of millions in attorney fees, plus who knows what information would have come out in discovery.", "> Remember how he claimed that Twitter was overvalued because they couldn't give him convincing figures on how many accounts were bots? \n\nIt's worse than that. He said he wanted to buy Twitter so that he could solve the bot problem. He signed a contract to overpay (the one he *offered* was seller-friendly, and Twitter negotiated to make it even worse for him). Then he tried to back out of it because of bots as though that's not exactly what he said he wanted to solve *and* he hadn't waived due diligence.", "I just had a very interesting conversation about the ulterior motives behind all of this twitter nonsense. The ideas people came up with were more fun than the actual madness"]}
