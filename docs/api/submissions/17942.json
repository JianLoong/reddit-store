Probably be best she be the last to know when you give birth.", "NTA. I\u2019ve dealt with similar behavior from my mom through my pregnancy and finally snapped at her about a month ago for a very similar thing. It sounds like the texts we sent were almost identical.

Boomers need to understand that everyone is entitled to privacy.", "NTA - this is classic \u201creverse victim and offender\u201d behavior.", "If I knew where you lived, I\u2019d be giving you a standing ovation as you back up your car in the morning: NTA. Do NOT apologize and put her on an info diet\u2014 she gets no information until you\u2019ve told everyone from your in-laws to your dry cleaner.", "Lesson learned... don't tell your mother anything that you don't want to have shared with all of her FB friends... and beyond.\n\nYou wanted to big moment with your mom, on Mother's Day, but did you stop to consider how your mom handles secrets?  I'm betting that this is not the first time that she has spilled the beans, so you probably should have known what was going to happen.\n\nAlso, no, you are not more important than your mother, or anybody else.  Are you one of those women that thinks that just because a sperm invaded one of your eggs that you are special?  News flash... you are not.  There are many, many women that are pregnant, just like you.  You are not special.\n\nGrow up.  You and your mother created a ridiculous mess and now you are fighting over who is the biggest a-hole.  And just in case you aren't sure... you are both a-holes, so stop bickering about who is worse.", "NTA and from now on your mom finds out everything last (if at all) from social media after you have posted.", "NTA - she can\u2019t respect your requests and boundaries so you were fully entitled to rip her a new one.", "NTA.  And now your mother (AND your sister) are the last ones to find out anything.", "NTA. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had a good husband. But it appears you were very clear about wanting this info to be private between only a small amount of people, and she didn\u2019t respect that. Good on you for putting your foot down", "NTA\n\nWhat is up with these entitled grandparents exposing the pregnancy of someone when that same person TOLD THEM TO NOT TELL ANYONE BEFORE THEM??? It isn\u2019t hard to follow. And it seems you were planning on tell everyone eventually. It\u2019s your baby. Not hers. Your sister needs to toughen up a bit. She sounds like a doormat in the making", "NTA, good for you!", "NTA, it wasn\u2019t her secret to share and you specifically told her not to tell anyone.", "NTA.  MIL needs to learn some self control.  She wanted the attention of spreading the news.", "NTA- your mother has now proven herself to be a boundary stomper, and should be put on an information diet. She should be the absolute last to know anything else about the pregnancy, delivery, pictures, etc. Anything you share with her, she\u2019s going to slap up on social media for likes and attention. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s putting you through it. I\u2019ve dealt with that kind of behavior as well and I dealt with it just as harshly.", "NTA.\n\n>my sister thinks my message was mean and I should have been nicer in my delivery\n\nSounds like you tried nice, and nice wasn't working.", "I dunno, has your mother ever kept a secret? Some people just can't.\n\nWere you being responsible by telling a woman incapable of keeping secrets in advance of your big reveal to others?\n\nWhile it made a \"cute\" mother's day gift, I kind of hold you responsible for telling someone before it was supposed to be generally known.\n\nI understand why you are angry. I don't know if you expect a horse to be a zebra though.\n\nOnly you do.", "NTA and damn I find it so annoying to even have to tell people \"don't post about this\". I've been off all social media for several years now and it's honestly so refreshing", "NTA. This wasn\u2019t a minor thing. This was a huge violation to steal your Thunder and make your big news all about her. She wants to be the main character. \n\nYou made it clear that more behavior like that will revoke her \u201cgrandmother\u201d status- if she can\u2019t respect very basic and common boundaries and courtesies, then she doesn\u2019t get to know your child. No grandchild relationship, no grandparent status. \n\nYour sister is wrong. You already tried reminding your mother gently. She ignored it and did what she wanted. \n\nPut her on an info diet. She doesn\u2019t get to know gender or name or when you go into labor or meet the baby or even get pictures until you\u2019re ready to share them with their world. She\u2019s shown she can\u2019t be trusted with private info, so therefore she won\u2019t be trusted with any.\n\nMy MIL is a lovely woman who I love. But she is an airhead and cannot keep anything private. We learned this early on- it took her less than 15 minutes to spill some of my pregnancy related medical info to my sister in law. I called her on it and my FIL tried to say she didn\u2019t (mostly because he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d do something like that) but I was standing right there. So my FIL said \u201cwife, did you just tell SIL about OP\u2019s medical situation?!\u201d Her response was \u201cyes, was I not supposed to?\u201d She wasn\u2019t being snarky- she literally already forgot- just total airhead. She was sorry and embarrassed when she realized what she did. That was 13 years ago. In that time, I\u2019ve heard countless things from her about other people that I shouldn\u2019t know. She is a total gossip. She\u2019s not malicious in her intent, she\u2019s just thoughtless. Ever since, she\u2019s on an info diet and doesn\u2019t even know it. We only tell her what we are ready for the world to know. My husband recognizes that she is a ditz. She\u2019s a loving and generous grandma and a kind MIL- as long as I recognize this annoying quirk and adjust accordingly.\n\n\nYour mom, however, did it on purpose. She didn\u2019t forget or she wouldn\u2019t have sent the midnight message. So act accordingly. Don\u2019t trust her with info you don\u2019t want shared.\n\nNTA and congrats on the pregnancy!", "NTA She was wrong to share your news but I am sure she was so excited she couldn't contain it.  I hope you can mend things.  You are going to need your Mom.  Just don't tell her any secrets.....", "NTA you spoke the truth. You didn't sling mud or call names. You were honest. Sometimes the truth hurts. Honestly I would have been so furious with her continuously disregarding my feelings, I probably wouldn't have even spoken to her for a while.", "NTA. I learned a long time ago that if I wanted anything kept quiet I could not tell my mother. She never learned boundaries, or what information is hers to share and what isn\u2019t. It sounds like your mother is the same.", "NTA", "NTA I am a man and I had a mother like this. Her thoughts and feelings mattered more than mine. She never understood when she over stepped in my life and would be dismissive of my feelings saying nearly the same thing as your mother. My relationship was toxic with my mother and I made the tough decision to cut her out of my life. I had a very difficult time with this decision but I came to terms with it eventually as I got nothing from the relationship with my mother.", "Yup, info diet! And be careful sharing info with the \"flying monkeys\" who will immediately blab to mom.", "Or she could feed her lies about the baby and let nmom spin in her own dirty diaper when she is called out - again - for spreading info that wasn\u2019t hers to share.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to calm her down, but you can tell her that you mean business and she has blown her final chance to prove that she can be trusted. Then firm boundaries are put in place and her access to your child is limited/restricted. \n\nIf she is ever with you and your baby - tell her to pull out her phone, shut it off, and put it in her bag because she won\u2019t be needing it for pics.  Those are the rules she needs to get through her head because YOU are calling the shots now.  Tell her that, verbatim. Put it in texts. She doesn\u2019t get a say unless it\u2019s to support you and to comply with your boundaries. \n\nAnything else is unacceptable and will result in immediate NC. Each additional infraction is a longer period of NC. you get it (and you\u2019ve got this!  Be blunt and direct and embrace your shiny spine!)", "I\u2019m ready but I\u2019m not exactly eager.", "That your sister fears losing support for disagreeing tells me everything I need to know about your mother. NTA.", "Not sure if anyone has posted this but....\n\n\nr/justnomil", "NTA at all. \n\nI understand being excited, but you made it EXTREMELY clear that you didn\u2019t want it public yet and she didn\u2019t give a shit. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t an accident. It was an \u201cooops!\u201d She 100% went against your wishes. And there\u2019s just no excuse for that, especially since you told her a second time. \n\n\n\nDo what you have to do and set your boundaries now because this isn\u2019t going to get better magically after the baby comes. \n\nYou and your partner get to decide things like if/what to post on social media, what to feed the kiddo, what toys/electronics are appropriate, etc. Grandma needs to learn her place so you\u2019re not having this argument over and over. \n\nMy brother and SIL don\u2019t want to my niece and nephews on social media, period. It stinks! As an aunt I want to share about my amazing niblings! But Mom and Dad get to make that call- I don\u2019t! \n\nDig your heels in and let her know- Mom outranks Grandma every damn time on decisions like this!!", "Has she ever kept a secret?", "Send her a text in the middle of the night asking if she would like to know, and then a few minutes later post it directly on FB... she knows the drill, she pulled it first.", "It\u2019s a consequence. She\u2019s taking your life news and making it about her. A consequence is she can find out when everyone else does. Or not at all. Same with birth announcement.", "No it's not petty. She has shown you she cannot be trusted with this information and disregards your feelings.", "Nope.  It's called consequences.", "It\u2019s not petty. it\u2019s preventing her from spoiling your news which you know she will spoil.", "Absolutely NOT too petty at all!! Look what she did to you! Maybe if you give her some of her own medicine she MIGHT learn her lesson (although from what you\u2019ve said, I seriously doubt it).", "She really was operating under the adage of \"it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission\". \n\nI'm about a week behind you (10 weeks pregnant) and your story is exactly why I haven't told my mom yet. It's sad because I want to have that moment of telling her but I also know she'll tell everyone and the family rumor mill will start running in full force.", "I'd be tempted to tell her that she's excited for nothing since she'll never meet her grandbaby if she keeps this up.", "Be careful there. I'm a former mod and the whole sub is just a toxic echo chamber sometimes.", "This is the worst possible take. Don't blame someone for being raised by a shitty parent and doing what they had to do to get by. I'm assuming you have NO idea what it's like to be raised by a parent like that, in which case you should take several seats.", "Thanks for the tip!", "She has, but I guess in retrospect that\u2019s probably because she didn\u2019t care about the secret and forgot it.", "Sooooo you know what your mom sounds like right?  Just sayin.", "Families suck sometimes. Consider it a lesson learned. Your mom has a problem with boundaries and don\u2019t tell her anything you don\u2019t want shared with her FB friends. Best of luck on your pregnancy!"]}
