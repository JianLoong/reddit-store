That she wasn\u2019t the priority here, I was, and I was tired of catering to her feelings while she stepped all over mine.\n\nI'm guessing that your mom has a history of pulling these kinds of stunts...\n\nYou may need to consider putting her on an information diet.\n\n**If you're concerned about her publishing photos, an option in WhatsApp is to send disappearing photos that can only be opened once.**\n\nBest wishes.", "NTA you said exactly what she needed to hear, now get ready to enforce those boundaries", "NTA.

Probably be best she be the last to know when you give birth.", "NTA. I\u2019ve dealt with similar behavior from my mom through my pregnancy and finally snapped at her about a month ago for a very similar thing. It sounds like the texts we sent were almost identical.

No grandchild relationship, no grandparent status. \n\nYour sister is wrong. You already tried reminding your mother gently. She ignored it and did what she wanted. \n\nPut her on an info diet.

I called her on it and my FIL tried to say she didn\u2019t (mostly because he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d do something like that) but I was standing right there.

She was sorry and embarrassed when she realized what she did. That was 13 years ago. In that time, I\u2019ve heard countless things from her about other people that I shouldn\u2019t know. She is a total gossip. She\u2019s not malicious in her intent, she\u2019s just thoughtless. Ever since, she\u2019s on an info diet and doesn\u2019t even know it.

Did she think you were mean or does she agree with you?\n3. I don't mean to give you a hard time here, but I think the dynamics in your family (of origin) run really deep.

My Daughter is pregnant too! Only a few weeks ahead of you.\n\nShe announced it online a few days after telling me. It was a Tuesday. The following Friday I put a post up.  Why did I wait 4 days?

His brother and SIL came along and started to get annoyed because they'd only seen my post and not hers until I explained I'd waited 4 days. \n\nWhat I'm saying is - don't let her think she's more important than you. You are totally NTA.\n\nMoving forward, you need to retrain her if you want her to be around the baby. If you don't, she will never listen to any of your rules. This is a small indication of the way she will boundary stomp, so use this opportunity to sit her down and have a longer conversation with her about how the future will look. Bring up your plans for parenting and how you want her relationship with your baby to look, and then tell her how sad you'll be if you have to cut her out. Utilize this moment as a learning opportunity for all of you. \n\nGood Luck!"]}
