But like, you reached your limit and that\u2019s understandable and a thing that just happens sometimes. Give it a few days and reach out to your mom about what happened. If you think she can be better than this you need to act like it because jumping to \u201cI will cut you out of my life\u201d is likely to put your mom into panic mode and make her extra defensive.

That she wasn\u2019t the priority here, I was, and I was tired of catering to her feelings while she stepped all over mine.\n\nI'm guessing that your mom has a history of pulling these kinds of stunts...\n\nYou may need to consider putting her on an information diet.\n\n**If you're concerned about her publishing photos, an option in WhatsApp is to send disappearing photos that can only be opened once.**\n\nBest wishes.", "NTA you said exactly what she needed to hear, now get ready to enforce those boundaries", "NTA.

Probably be best she be the last to know when you give birth.", "NTA. I\u2019ve dealt with similar behavior from my mom through my pregnancy and finally snapped at her about a month ago for a very similar thing. It sounds like the texts we sent were almost identical.

Besides, due to work, I can't share whatever kind of pictures. (I work for the government.) My future mother-in-law is a compulsive photo-sharer. We got into 3 huge fights before she realized she couldn't share photos of me without my permission. My boyfriend has a younger brother (20 years old). When these fights happened 3 years ago, both my boyfriend and his younger brother realized that they were not obliged to put up with this. (I never encouraged them to argue their mother, but I admit, I don't regret that they started to stand up for themselves on this subject due to my influence.) I already made it clear to my boyfriend that when we have a child, the same rule will apply, and FMIL won't be able to share anything about the child without our permission and therefore I am willing to go as far as needed. If necessary, I will not leave her alone with the child, if necessary I will not let her see the kid at all. This is on the one hand that you can't share pictures of children without their parents' permission, and on the other hand, that she have serious issues with respecting other people's boundaries and need to understand that you can't treat others as your property. My boyfriend totally agrees with me on this. These grandparents and in-laws who refuse to acknowledge that their child is an independent person, and that they cannot control their life and make decisions for them, are horrible.", "Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. \n\n\u201cI never did that!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the abusive one!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hurt my feelings!

I saw what she was once I was old enough, and knew they were looking out for me.\n\nDon't let her guilt you on this. You know what's best for your child in terms of their relationship with your mom. She will try to manipulate you like crazy and so will others. We have this romanticized idea of the grandma relationship, but it's not one size fits all. \n\nBest of luck!", "Thanks!", "I couldn\u2019t care less that you think I\u2019m TA.

She can find out everything after you've posted it to social media or informed everyone else.", "Bro, you're the narcissistic asshole kinda people she has to get away of.

Talk about unrealistic expectations. \n\nAnd then you made a huge deal out of it and turned a happy event into a family feud. Was all this really necessary? FFS... Everyone should be happy! Everyone! You should be happy, your mother should be happy, your sister, everyone! You are all getting a new family member! \n\nWhy aren't you happy? Because your mother blew the whistle?

Be mindful of the fact that this is indicative of her mindset. So if you have any rules regarding how you want your child raised, know that she will flagrantly go against them when she is around your child.

No, not even a little.\n\nYour mother sounds like a narcissist, or at the very least incredibly self centered and immature.

More adults need to put their parents in their place when they overstep, because so many are just...conditioned to put up with the unreasonable amounts of disrespectful bullshit from someone just because they raised you.\n\nYour mother had every chance to apologize and acknowledge her fuck up, but she kept making it all, \"oh, but can you blame me for being excited\" and then eventually, \"why are you ruining this for me?\" You, the woman actually carrying the pregnancy are being expected to be delicate to the woman who blabbed when asked not to, because she's just so excited to be an auxiliary family member to a baby.\n\nNTA", "NTA I told my mother I was expecting at 11 weeks and asked her not to tell.
