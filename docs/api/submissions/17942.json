You want to control the narrative of your announcement, you want to control how other people interface with the information, you want to control Who receives the congratulations (you vs grandma, for example), all that. It's just an exercise of control, but you don't get to control other people.\n\nNext time, set better boundaries sure, (there were none set here.

It's our business", "ESH your mother got overly excited and a little self centered as a result, and then was pretty shitty in refusing to apologize properly. I don\u2019t think you are AN asshole but I think you might have been able to de escalate the situation better by walking away at that point and letting everyone\u2019s feelings settle down. But like, you reached your limit and that\u2019s understandable and a thing that just happens sometimes. Give it a few days and reach out to your mom about what happened. If you think she can be better than this you need to act like it because jumping to \u201cI will cut you out of my life\u201d is likely to put your mom into panic mode and make her extra defensive. If you really do have a bad relationship with her and don\u2019t want her around that\u2019s one thing  but if you think this whole situation was uncharacteristic you need to cut her a little slack if only because you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar", "NAH.

If you reward bad behaviour you help create the monster", "NTA. You have to set boundaries with grandmothers asap.

Respond to everything she says for a while just with 'It's not about you'. That'll make her good and crazy...", "My sister is still reliant on my mother for things like medical and phone, so while she agrees with me in private, I think she\u2019s worried about the consequences if she openly defies our mother.

My husband and I are not active on social media, and the idea of random strangers having access to pictures of my baby have me uneasy as heck.

OP isn't TA only grandma is.", "Wow! Trying to make this woman feel that HER pregnancy is about her mother becoming a grandmother is just such a bully thing to do. Sharing the news of a pregnancy is the privilege of the parents. They explicitly asked the mother to not share with anyone. And you still think OP is in the wrong? Wow.

Her and I have been back and forth fighting for about a week now, and I\u2019m dealing with a decent amount of emotional and psychological damage after the interactions. I posted this because I actually started to worry that I was in the wrong, but so far it seems I\u2019m not crazy.", "So you and your sister are okay taking money and support from Mom while resenting and complaining about her?

It doesn\u2019t mean we love them any less but you have to be judicious how and when you share information. I\u2019m sorry for you it\u2019s your mom, but you know at this age, she won\u2019t change. She probably doesn\u2019t even see what the big deal is because of her self-centeredness. It\u2019s too late to do anything about this now but in the future find a good friend or someone else to confide in.

You'd be justified if you did it, though.", "My sister and I *as children* needed the support of our mother and couldn\u2019t quite frankly live without it. We learned very quickly that it was contingent on her feeling loved and appreciated, or she would take away the things she provided. I got my independent career going a handful of years back and have cut off monetary ties, but my sister had a bit of a slower start and is still working on separating. And I assure you the support was never for *free*, so you can stop worrying that we were taking advantage of our poor mother.", "I know you\u2019re right. I just get jealous of the people I know who can go to family for anything and know they have their backs. I just don\u2019t understand why that\u2019s not the normal for everyone, and it feels really lonely to suspect (and have confirmed) that you matter less to them than their own ego.", "As someone who's mother constantly took advantage of the idea that \"I pay for the house you live in\" as a child (which she didn't, she never worked long and my dad paid for everything) to demand our servitude and tolerance of her irrational behaviors, I appreciate your comment and how well written it is when I know the rage you must have felt typing this. Also, NTA. I wish I could do that to my mother but haven't had the guts to yet."]}
