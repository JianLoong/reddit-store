She said we\u2019d 50/50 the cost. Then things went south and it became I\u2019m paying all my tuition and groceries and she pressured me into a sorority but sorority is on me. The problem now is she\u2019s only paying my apartment but even that is a big cost because as a student taking 5 math classes with pre req of cal 2-3 is time consuming play then my mom time, it killed my job because I was getting like 4-5 hours a sleep. So I quit and she keeps punishing me by telling me the day of my rent that she\u2019s not paying because I\u2019ve been bad. I had thousands saved up but now I have like 300$ from all the punishing mom fees. So I feel defeated, and that playing nice is my safest option.

Whether it's right or not, I probably would be the same way, I feel as though I would feel like let me use her to get back what I feel is owed to me.\n\nThe biggest thing is that you stay safe physically, mentally and emotionally.

I wish you the best and take care of you.", "Agreed!", "That\u2019s a narcissistic trait. To make you feel guilty for reacting to something they did wrong. \n\nYou have absolutely nothing to feel guilty for. She is abusing her relationship with you and abusing your good nature.", "You're not the asshole. And if you need to deal with her until you graduate for financial reasons, whatever methods keep you sane are fair ones.

I think you might be more financially free than you realize, if I'm reading this right. \n\nYou say she has a financial hold on you but... she keeps finding excuses to punish you by not paying for the things she said she would. As a consequence, you're covering all your tuition and your groceries already, as well as your rent. So... she's not paying for anything, just saying she will to keep you on her leash, then finding excuses and reasons to punish you by not paying. (The sorority can go. It's not a necessity, and your mother can suck it up. It's a time and financial drain you don't need or want).\n\nYou need that job to keep up your savings. If your mother isn't paying for anything, she has nothing to hold over you so you don't need to feel obligated to spend time with her. Take the time you'd have spent with the toxic mother to sleep and get a job.  Is there anyone at your university you can sit down and talk with about lightening that course load a bit? It's okay to do that, and a good college will work with you because it's in their vested interest to have you succeed: they want you to keep paying, after all!\n\nYou are stronger than you think you are honey, and you CAN get through this <3 \n\nAnd I'll say it again: your father needs to stop being a coward and start standing up for you, because I see NOTHING in your post about him doing what he should be in this situation with your mother.", "Ok I accept that. Though it seems she\u2019s doing it cause she wants to see her and loves her and not to make her feel bad. \nChanging to ESH.", "Good luck with it all\n\nSorry your mom sucks :( you deserve better", "Another great place to learn you are not alone is the Captain Awkward dot com blog.  There are so many people who have written in for help on narcissist parents, going LC/NC, boundaries, and lots of stuff, and the commenters often have really helpful stuff they share.

It was a fucking game-changer when I discovered that sub awhile back. I kept going \"oh my god other people's parents do this same shit? It's not just me?\" as I scrolled thru. For the first time ever I didn't feel alone or feel like I was crazy or overreacting to my dad's actions. It gave me so much confidence to really call my dad's behavior abusive, bc it was, but I'd always shied away from calling it that since it wasn't physical or sexual, and being able to name it for what it was made it so much easier to really address it and start repairing the damage.\n\nI've been NC w my dad for 10 years this summer.

Turns out she holds it above me every time I\u2019m bad. Last time I told her I was dating a black guy and she stopped the payments until we broke up.

But all these payments are coming out of my savings. And my savings has only 300$ even my job couldn\u2019t keep up with it. I\u2019m gonna try and apply for my sorority inactive fee for the rest of next year so I\u2019m technically \u201cin\u201d it and it\u2019s cheaper and hopefully it\u2019ll keep me safe till graduation. \n\nAlso yea my dad is terrified of her and he\u2019s also got heart issues and he\u2019s at that age where he\u2019s uh, you know old and his family has lots of health problems so hes been betting quite forgetful and a bit of a shell. I want to take him to a doctor, my mother doesn\u2019t, he can\u2019t physically take care of himself and mentally he\u2019s fading if that makes sense? \n\nHe stops her from visiting me as often and takes some emotional and financial beatings from her, but this past year it has been less because of his rapid declining health:(. He came from a very drug abused family and they all passed very early due to long term drug abuse. But he was escaped and I think he was wants me to escape because he did and he\u2019s doing better than his father but he\u2019s just a shell right now.\n\n\nEdit down below\nMy plan as of right now is to just play Barbie for this last year. Get a secret job and buy a banged up car and then return my jeep after I graduate. Get a new SIM card and new provider for my phone. See if I can try and get her to pay for my apartment and if there\u2019s anything left I\u2019ll use it on my tuition. That is the good thing, she doesn\u2019t actually direct pay she drops it into my account because she\u2019s too lazy to actually learn how my apartment website works.

Not really, and yet it's exceedingly telling to me that I spent the first decade of my adult life floundering around being a human dumpster fire, and by the end of the second decade - after going NC - I've reached a stable, successful point in my life.
