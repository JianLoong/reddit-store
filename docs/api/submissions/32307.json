{"id": 32307, "submission_id": "18ab0nj", "title": "AITA for refusing to take down a snapchat story post even after my sister begged me to?", "selftext": "I (16m) took a picture of our front porch after Someone had glitter bombed our house, smeared some paint on our pillar on our front porch, and kicked our front door. The picture I posted only showing the porch and pillar, with a caption \"Who tf glitter bombed our porch and smeared paint on our pillar?\" And posted it on my public story, and my HS snap story, a new addition to snapchat. Shortly after, my sister (14f) asked me to take it down. I talked to my dad and he said I could keep it up. Shortly after, my sister calls my mom and begs her to make me take it down. My mom calls me and we talk. She also says I can keep it up. Later, my sister messages me and begs me to take it down. We get into an argument where I ask her for any reason, to which she says its embarrassing and public humiliation. Again, I ask her to explain because she's being rather vague. What is there to be embarrassed about? She then asks why I can't just back her up and names all the things she does for me. Guilt hits after she asks me that. So of course, though it won't solved anything after 300 people have seen it, i take the picture down. She continues to name things she says about me and my friends, backing us up to her friends, and the guilt sets in more. I feel bad for making her that embarrassed but I don't see how I was embarrassing her by posting that picture. Mind you, it doesn't show anything special about our home. No land marks or stand-outs other than a few porch decorations. \nSo, aita?\n\nEdit:\nI realized I should add my sister is popular at our school and I'm the opposite. She is on all three cheer teams football, basketball, and competition. However, because of that, its well known amongst the people she knows, that we're siblings. One of the things she had mentioned was that her friends were messaging her about it the post I made, knowing I was related to her without knowing me or following me on snap. \n\nEdit (2): I've read all of the comments both the nta and yta ones. I didn't really take into consideration that this was a form of bullying because she had talked to her friends and they said its happened to them too. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was. She had recently said there's a rumor going around, that I won't explicitly say, but it wasn't great. And I wouldn't doubt if the girl who spread the rumor had a part to play with all of the glitter. I'll bring it up to my parents when the time is right, but I don't know when that'll be, as my mom was sent to the hospital this morning. My sister cares very much about her popularity and doesnt like it when I'm around when her friends are. Or when I dress how I like. We are polar opposites and havent gotten along for years. Her asking me to take it down felt more like her hiding our relation as much as possible rather than embarrassment for what happened. Even still, I don't know why this would be embarrassing, as I feel people should know if someone is running around kicking front doors after smearing paint and throwing glitter. But I do appreciate several sides I'm getting from everyone.

This is one of those gray areas where you have every *right* to stick to your guns, but it's also reasonable to just graciously concede to avoid upsetting someone, even if they don't have a rational reason to be upset.  The right think to do kind of depends on context: if you're being treated like a doormat, it can be necessary to stick up for yourself, but having empathy and compassion is a good personality trait.

It seems your sister knows more than she lets on.", "I feel like the sister is hiding something or might know the one who did it. Does anyone at school know that your her sister?", "Exactly. It sounds as if she\u2019s being bullied, and this is part of it, or someone wanted revenge for something she did. OP\u2019s parents need to talk to her.", "She was in the house when it had happened, so shes got a clear alibi", "Exactly. The sister is trying to protect the perp\u2026probably friends of her BF\u2019s.", "Then she knows who did it, that's why she wanted the photo taken down so quickly and badly.", "It was probably retribution for something she did and she doesn\u2019t want the parents getting wise.", "Okay, then it was maybe one of her friends and she's either covering for them or they're giving her hell about it because she's knows they did it.", "Isn't it a bit a bit concerning tho? Your sister might know who did it and was hysteric when you posted about it. So she's scared of the person who did it.", "To all the people saying that she knows who did it... not necessarly. She's probably just being bullied because of it. \n\nBoys rarely pay attention to social media, and if somethings up then it quickly gets physical, and thats what keeping boys in check. If you go too far you'll get punched. \n\nBut girls... let me tell you, they can be really cruel. Some girl must have seen that post, and probably gathered group of other girls and are bullying your sister. I mean, you say that she's popular, so i can only imagine how many girls envy her. And since they envy her, they'll use everything to bring her down. And you just gave them the ammunition. \n\nBesides - i dont see a reason for you posting this all over social media. I mean, what you hope to achieve? Gain popularity? Even if you do, then trust me, its not the kind of popularity you want. And no, you wont find person responsible this way, because nobody is stupid enough to write under your story \"its my fault, i did it, sorry\".\n\nAs for why she wont say whats going on. Its embarrasing, and she's probably also afraid that you'll laugh or tell parents or do something reckless and stupid escalating this thing further.", "Your sister probably knows who did it, try and find out more", "NTA. Your sister knows exactly who did it", "YTA. Don\u2019t be a turd and support your sibling. Social media is BS and whatever clout you\u2019re getting will fade", "I'd say slight YTA.\n\nWhat do you expect from your post? That someone would show up and say \"I did it\".\nVery small chance of that happening.\nOn the other hand - very big chance that your sister will remember your attitude and will use it against you the next time you need her help.", "She 100% knows why this happened. She wants the story down because she probably pissed off the wrong cheerleader. She either doesn't want the family to know it's her fault or she doesn't want her peers to know in that they might start asking why it was done and the reasoning go public.", "This is what I was thinking!", ">   people need to give reasons for unusual requests\n\nThey really don't though sometimes. This is a very simple matter that would really cost nothing to op to help her.\n\nSome times people want help but are not ready to go into details why, empathy helps.\n\nOp could easily delete the post and tell his sister she can tell him the story and why when she is ready, because we can all see (here) that the glitter bomb has something to do with her. But they are both teenagers so they are both awkward and the story here.\n\nI don't think op is ta, neither is his sister atm (she probably looks like the target, so maybe not so popular as op thinks?), but op lacks some social awareness. Which again, fair enough since he is a teenager himself", "Quite a few people. She had made a statement last night that it was because \"she lives here\" but that was it", "People share doing all kinds of dumb ass things online. It wouldn't surprise me if someone saw a post of someone glitter bombing their house and informed them. If the sister had nothing to do with it, it wouldn't have been a problem. NTA at all.", "She is involved somehow though. Either her friends did it, or it was aimed at her, either as intimidation or retribution.", "She is involved somehow though. Either her friends did it, or it was aimed at her, either as intimidation or retribution.", "How come you didn't press her to tell you the real reason? Not to taunt her but from a place of concern for her.", "Context matters. When you're asking people if they knew who trashed you house, and your sis asks you to take down the post, there better be a good reason because it sounds like you're trying to protect the vandal.", "Kind of sounds like it was a retaliation and she doesn\u2019t want what it was a retaliation on to be known.", "Based on the sister being the \"popular one\" it feels like maybe... she has been doing something like bullying and that was their way for revenge? That's how it reads to me.", "Since this is high school, I'm getting teen movie vibes. The sister is the popular one so I'm thinking she slept with someone's bf, or caught flirting. This is public revenge plot. I want a update to this one though lol.", "I mean I wouldn't call you the asshole for it but if your sister is that nice to you, I don't get why she has to give you a reason, it clearly is upsetting her, a good sibling would remove it based on that alone and ask more questions later. unless she has given you reason not to trust her of course.", "YTA. Your sister's feelings are more important than your snapchat post. People get bullied for the stupidest shit and protecting your sister should be your priority", "Your sister either did it or is friends with who did it.", "YTA, the real reason you're keeping it up is to upset her. she seems like shes being bullied or something over it and instead of making things easier for her you're intentionally upsetting her", "Yta. Dont ever post your home on social media. You have no idea who can see it.", "Could she be gay and be bullied for it?", "Is she a porch pirate? Some people's delivery packages keep getting stolen so they plant fake parcels by their door in hopes the thief takes it. It's meant to be a bit of revenge if the package is opened in a vehicle or house. That glitter bomb can make a huge mess.", "NTA unless she's in it, NTA", "Your sister did it. I actually can\u2019t believe you took it down, though. I wouldn\u2019t budge without a reason even if my sibling sobbed themselves into oblivion. She was emotionally blackmailing you and you fell for it.", "There is a big chunk of this story missing, mainly, why it bothers her so much", ">You do realize that your sister is tied to the incident somehow right\n\nThat's a big conclusion to jump to... more likely she is just being bullied because of the incident", "Yes, and what is this \"things she says about me and my friends, backing us up to her friends\". Eww. As if it's something praiseworthy. That just likely means her friends are trash judging others on appearances and hobbies. And her thinking that's a favor she's done OP tends to show she's like them.", "Our parents do know. They were the one that called her from her room to show her what happened", "I wanted to make it clear, to not just you but people who read the comments as well. The picture didn't show past the porch from the view of the front door frame. You can't see past the porch, no street signs were shown, roads, or cars. No ones face either", "I hope not. But she in the basement when the porch got covered in glitter", "She was not", "When I was in the Marching Band back in HS we'd TP each others' houses.  Parents were generally in on it and I don't ever recall it actually being an issue.  \n\nThis could be a hazing prank- getting the new kids was always on our list- but if it is, a glitter bomb is way harder to clean up and there was actual property damage involved, and so OP is definitely justified in getting upset.", "Yeah she definitely doesn\u2019t want it broadcasted that she\u2019s getting bullied. Your snap is not helpful. No one is going to fess up and me give an apology. All you did was show that the popular girl\u2019s house got hit. Meaning she\u2019s losing status", "Omg you\u2019re an idiot. \n\nWhy would she do that to her own house? Obviously someone did it as revenge or as a warning. The only one that cares is your sister\u2026.. how have you not realised what\u2019s going on?", "She probably knows who did it or why.", "Than she knows who and why it happened", "But if she is being bullied, do they know that? \n\nYour sister has a connection to what happened. Either because she knows who did, or why they did it, or she is getting bullied over it. That connection is what scared her and prompted her request for you to remove the post.", "Doesn't sound like the reason she's upset about it then.", "Oh, I remember the good old TP days. I did some,  and I got in return. This was out of spite. Paint, damage, and let's be real only people who really don't like someone glitterbombs.", "Are you a bot?", "I was TPing band houses close to 20 years ago.  These things have a tendency to escalate in severity if no one checks them, unfortunately.  I have no doubt it was malicious, absolutely, but it could have been a malicious escalation of a hazing prank is I guess my point.", "At 14? I know it happens, but ew!"]}
