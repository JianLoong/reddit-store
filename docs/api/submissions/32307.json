{"id": 32307, "submission_id": "18ab0nj", "title": "AITA for refusing to take down a snapchat story post even after my sister begged me to?", "selftext": "I (16m) took a picture of our front porch after Someone had glitter bombed our house, smeared some paint on our pillar on our front porch, and kicked our front door. The picture I posted only showing the porch and pillar, with a caption \"Who tf glitter bombed our porch and smeared paint on our pillar?\" And posted it on my public story, and my HS snap story, a new addition to snapchat. Shortly after, my sister (14f) asked me to take it down. I talked to my dad and he said I could keep it up. Shortly after, my sister calls my mom and begs her to make me take it down. My mom calls me and we talk. She also says I can keep it up. Later, my sister messages me and begs me to take it down. We get into an argument where I ask her for any reason, to which she says its embarrassing and public humiliation. Again, I ask her to explain because she's being rather vague. What is there to be embarrassed about? She then asks why I can't just back her up and names all the things she does for me. Guilt hits after she asks me that. So of course, though it won't solved anything after 300 people have seen it, i take the picture down. She continues to name things she says about me and my friends, backing us up to her friends, and the guilt sets in more. I feel bad for making her that embarrassed but I don't see how I was embarrassing her by posting that picture. Mind you, it doesn't show anything special about our home. No land marks or stand-outs other than a few porch decorations. \nSo, aita?\n\nEdit:\nI realized I should add my sister is popular at our school and I'm the opposite. She is on all three cheer teams football, basketball, and competition. However, because of that, its well known amongst the people she knows, that we're siblings. One of the things she had mentioned was that her friends were messaging her about it the post I made, knowing I was related to her without knowing me or following me on snap.

This is one of those gray areas where you have every *right* to stick to your guns, but it's also reasonable to just graciously concede to avoid upsetting someone, even if they don't have a rational reason to be upset.  The right think to do kind of depends on context: if you're being treated like a doormat, it can be necessary to stick up for yourself, but having empathy and compassion is a good personality trait.  Looks like you basically navigated a hard choice to the best of your ability, with the right concerns in mind.", "NTA, people need to give reasons for unusual requests rather than cite all the  things they've done in the past for you.\n\nAs it is, I bet she knows who did it and why.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
