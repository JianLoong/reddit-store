I\u2019m a bartender, and I know the other employees fairly well. Recently our manager left the job and the owner hired a new manager, \u201cSarah\u201d (F33).\n\nWe also have a bouncer, \u201cMax\u201d (M22). Max is a decent guy and a hard worker, but he has a mild case of dyslexia and some other intellectual issues that normally don\u2019t interfere with his job performance.\n\nSarah asked me whether she should know anything special about her new subordinates. I gave her a quick explanation, mentioning that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to expect anything over the top\u201d from Max. Here\u2019s where I f\u2019d up: I assumed it\u2019s a somewhat sensitive information about Max and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with disclosing it, I just said that \u201cI do all the big paperwork if needed\u201d and that \u201cMax doesn\u2019t do well under pressure\u201d. Max was off-work that day and he\u2019s unreachable when he\u2019s not on the job, like actually turns his phone off.\n\nSo a few days ago I was off-work, but Max was on his shift. An accident happened and he had to basically write a report for the manager. For some reason, he didn\u2019t ask anyone, as basically every time something report-worthy happens, I or the other coworkers do his job in order to spare the manager from whatever Max would come up with.\n\nSo Sarah got her report, half-readable due to the spelling and handwriting and she decided to yell at Max, what she absolutely shouldn\u2019t have done as Max doesn\u2019t do well with being yelled at and she knew about it. Basically, he told her quite an amount of rude stuff, with the tamest being \u201cgo f yourself\u201d. She was upset and shocked as it isn\u2019t a thing you\u2019d expect if you don\u2019t know Max personally and she asked me wtf it was.\n\nI explained the situation and she called me an AH saying I set both her and Max up for a failure. I tried to explain that it\u2019s sensitive information regarding a health condition, she said if it interferes with work, it\u2019s not sensitive.", "created_utc": 1699137316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17nxi07/aita_for_setting_up_my_manager_for_a_failure/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not your job to disclose information about your co-workers, plus anything you did disclose shouldn\u2019t be immediately accepted as truth by your manager anyway. Once your manager saw the report it was her job to figure out what was going by talking with (not yelling at) the employee; if he wanted to disclose anything directly to her, he could and she would need to help make accommodations, which it sounds like he\u2019d pretty much already worked out.", "Tbh I wouldn\u2019t even think to discuss that information ,and I don\u2019t think you are to blame .She should have just calmly asked max what he meant and not have gotten annoyed", "NTA.

The reason that Max can't spell is something that the manager should talk with Max about.\n\nAt the same time, yelling at someone for a poorly written incident report is bad management.

Did you tell her to yell at Max? That's 100% on her.\n\nNTA", "It's not always easy. Sometimes people are too embarrassed to tell a new manager their issues. And OP didn't need to name the diagnosis. \n\nOP is probably seen as the \"key\" person in the business and that's why she was asked. \n\nWhen a new manager appears, few people will rush to tell them their problems, whether it's \"I'm sometimes late because of xzy reason\" or \" I disappear into the bathroom frequently because of abc.\"  Yet it's the type of thing that helps the manager know whether to ignore something or ask a question.\n\nBeing a manager is a delicate balancing act sometimes. None of this, however, justifies the manager yelling at the guy nor being angry with OP."]}
