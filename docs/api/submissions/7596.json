Did you ever ask why he is on your birth certificate if he was only the donor. As far as I know, when you go through proper channels, he shouldn't be on the birth certificate. \n\n\nI did some checking, and if your parents went that route and added him to the birth certificate, then he is technically your legal parent.\n\n\nI find this very strange. Are you sure there wasn't some sort of arrangement?", "How did you find him on FB? Sperm donors are assigned numbers. Your parents would have no access to his name.", "INFO: Have you asked your parents for the exact details of your conception/birth? A sperm donation through a fertility clinic wouldn't result in the donor's name being on your birth certificate. Some details are missing here. Is the woman who raised you your biological mother? Did she cheat on the man who raised you with the sperm donor? Has she been purposely (possibly illegally) keeping you from the donor for 18 years? Or was there some traumatic (non-consensual) circumstance that resulted in your conception? There's something your parents aren't telling you.

Don\u2019t hold it against your parents that they didn\u2019t want you to go through with it. The experience could\u2019ve disappointed or hurt you. It may have been too much for you mentally to handle. They don\u2019t know the man and whether his entry into your life would\u2019ve been harmful to you or not. Finally, there\u2019s often a fear that you might end up choosing genes over them.\n\nIt is your right to meet your biological father, and it\u2019s awesome that it has been a good experience.

Your parents are being aggressive and manipulative.", "NTA:  You're 18 and it's your decision.", "NAH.\n\nYou are an adult and you have a perfect right to develop a relationship with anyone you choose.\n\nBut of course your parents are upset.  From their perspective, they raised you and you are their child.  The fact that you want to find \"new parents\" implies to them that they are not \"good enough.\"\n\nEDIT:  because bio dad's name was on birth certificate:  ~~This is not a case where your mother was with this man ever.~~  Or as if you were taken from him at some young age. There's no \"long lost family\" that was at your baptism.\n\n~~He donated sperm, probably in college, probably for money.   Meanwhile your parents had to spend money, and your mom go through a procedure, in order to have you.  Which is your \"real\" parent?~~", "NTA\nMaybe you should go about this head on? Tell your parents that even if you have a good relationship with you biological father, they will always stay your parents who you love most :). I think they are very scared of losing their child. This should definitely be talked over, because you really don't want to ruin your relationship with your parents for the sake of a, to put it harshly, sperm donor....", "Mostly NTA a weeeeee bit TA. Even though your parents didn\u2019t support your decision to meet your bio-father there should have been a conversation that you were going to do so despite their wishes. Many parents that use donors to conceive or adopt children often have personal hang ups about loosing their position as your parents and may fear they are going to be replaced by the bio-parent.  A clear conversation may have toned down some of the current animosity. \n\nHowever, hell yeah on meeting your bio-dad and forming a relationship there. Even though he wasn\u2019t there for the early years everyone that wants to know where they came from should be able to do so.", "NAH. I think it's reasonable to be curious about your biological sperm donor, but I think instead of sneaking off you should have explained your reasoning to your parents. \n\nIt's probably a sore spot for your parents... They raised and loved you so it'd be easy to interpret your actions as betrayal or like they aren't good enough. I'm sure that's not the case, but absent communication I think their upset is reasonable too.\n\nEdit: based on the birth certificate thing, it seems likely your parents have something they aren't telling you. Maybe an affair, maybe abuse, maybe a whoops. It's hard to say.", "NTA - it doesn't sound like you wanted to end the relationship with your parents, just that you wanted to get to know your bio-dad.  Sounds like you father may be insecure about not being your bio-dad.", "NTA- it\u2019s very natural and normal for you to want to meet your donor. It sounds like your parents never processed their own feeling about needing a donor and that shouldn\u2019t impact you. Hopefully they can seek support from a counsellor about it.", "NAH - Put yourself in their shoes. I imagine they a feeling some anxiousness at how this relationship would proceed. His name is on your birth certificate, so this was not a donation. At some point this man decided to step away from his child (you). I'm sure they are worried etc.", "NTA They may be feeling insecure and afraid you might like sperm donor more than your parents who raised you. I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re responding this way.", "NTA, you are legally an adult and can do what you please.", "You're N T A for wanting to meet bio dad, but YTA for the way you're handling this. They obviously know what's happening, and they obviously know you're lying to them every time you come home.\n\nYou need to get a serious reality check and decide what you do or don't want. **This is the kind of thing that kills relationships**. I strenuously recommend talking to a family counselor, how to navigate this situation without leaving your parents feeling completely betrayed is way beyond Reddit's paygrade.", "NTA, your adoptive parents have no saying on that whatsoever.", "NTA \n\nI get why your parents are upset. I think it is alot of people who use donors worst fear coming true. \n\nThat said how they are approaching it in response is passive ageessive and making the situation worse.", "NTA. Your parents chose to use a sperm donor and should have been prepared for you wanting to meet him.\n\nMy daughter was in the same situation, but wasn\u2019t interested in even getting any information about him. She hasn\u2019t met him in person but he knows about her and several other children, all girls by the way.", "NTA, you're old enough to make your own decisions and your parents should respect that.  I could understand if he didn't want to meet or something, but it sounds like he was really happy to meet you, so no problem there.  \n\nI can understand why your parents may be upset, but this is absolutely not a good way to respond.  They'll just end up pushing you away.", "NTA. I would have said no AH, but they are handling it poorly. Of COURSE you wanted to meet your biological dad. Any counselor or therapist could have told them before you were a year old that some day you would likely want to meet him. These stories are so common. It's not your fault for them being hurt, but it is their fault for how they treat you going forward. They will need to get over it, harsh as it sounds.", "YTA Kind of. There's nothing really wrong with you wanting to meet your biological father but there's really something wrong about you sneaking behind your parents back as though they're your enemies.", "NTA.   You are an adult.  Your parents haven't figured that out yet.", "NTA.  In these times, everyone who either, A) conceived a child with donor sperm or eggs, or B) conceived a child with someone who is not a part of their child's life, or C) conceived a child and then did not participate in the raising of that child, better be prepared to deal with the fallout of decisions made long ago.  Because the children are going to learn the full story, and meet with biological relatives, whether the Adults want them to or not.  To blame the children for seeking to know their own origin story is reprehensible.", "NTA but your parents are. Sounds like they were afraid that meeting your bio sperm donor (sorry not dad, giving sperm doesn\u2019t make you a parent) would somehow invalidate your relationship with them. The reasons they gave for you to not meet him? Not actually valid. If he doesn\u2019t want a relationship with you then it\u2019s up to HIM to decide that. He\u2019s an adult and can tell you that himself, it\u2019s not up to them to guess at what someone else might potentially think. It might \u201cruin his life\u201d? How? That\u2019s a very hurtful thing to say to your child. \n\nYour parents growing aggression toward you is also very concerning. It seems like they are controlling and manipulative to me. You are an adult and can decide for yourself who you want to have a relationship with. It\u2019s not up to them and they need therapy if this is triggering for them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mother lied to me about my father and I found out the truth after I saw my birth certificate.", "Donors are never on the birth certificate as that would mean certain rights and obligations. Unless of course the donor and recepients have a known donor agreement and this is part of this. This could be the case for you but my bet is your biodad is an ex of your mom. Why don't you ask your biodad what circumstances surrounded the donation, where did he donate (clinic), etc etc", "You need to ask your parents why a sperm donor was on the birth certificate and not the man who raised you. Because as everyone else has said, sperm donors do not sign the birth certificate.  They're usually not even present at the birth.", "I don't think that OP knew until this thread that a sperm donor's name isn't on the birth certificate. That's what the parents have told him, that it was a sperm donation. So something is very not right in this scenario and he needs to get clarification from someone on what the heck is going on.", "When I was a kid (80s and 90s) a lot of moms would call a man who didnt participate in the kids life \"sperm donor\" like another way of saying deadbeat dad. i wonder if OPs parents meant this initially and then decided to go with the lie.", "> But if that was the case, then the arrangement would have also included leaving his name off your birth certificate, making your mom's husband your legal father.\n\nSeriously. We have so many cases of someone who can prove they are not the father but because they either signed it at birth or was married at the time became the official father. Something is very fishy here.", "I don't think the parents are a same-sex couple since OP mentions having a dad (and presumably the other parent is a mum since he only mentions sperm donor and not a surrogate)."]}
