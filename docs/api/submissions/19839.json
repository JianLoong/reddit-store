People should start actually using anatomically correct language around toddlers more as not doing so can lead to a lot of stigma and issues later in life. It\u2019s way better he saw the blood and thought \u201cmoms had her period, it\u2019s a thing women get\u201d rather than falsely worried you\u2019d hurt yourself. Disgust and shame around periods (or bodily functions in general) is never a good thing. Unfortunately your child\u2019s father is a prime example of the behaviour that needs to be avoided", "NTA! He is an asshole for period shaming. We have come such a long way in normalizing and I\u2019m disgusted that there are still people out there wanting to shame others for explaining that something completely natural is completely natural? What we\u2019re you supposed to say to your son? That there is a demon coming out of there and he should run for his life? Ugh people like his father just need to GO AWAY", "NTA.   As you say, it is a normal body function like p00p and pee. \n\nThe thing here is that you both need to adress with your kid is the fact that he needs to respect people's private spaces such as going to the bathroom.  \n\nThat way he doesn't walk in on anybody, and if somebody walks in on him, he knows that is not normal and that he should report that immediately.", "NTA \n\nNormally I'd say approaching stuff like this that early on wouldn't be my approach but it's evident that was the best way to handle the situation at hand in your case\n\nThe father sounds extremely immature", "NTA - and good for you for handling this with compassion and sensitivity.  the father of your child sounds like he need to grow the fuck up and understand that this is part of being a woman.  the fact that he cannot understand that is a huge red flag", "NTA the kid ran in on you, it's not like you randomly sat him down and showed him a bloody pad or tampon. It sounds like you did a good job of explaining that you weren't hurt without 1, going into too much detail or 2, faking like it was something other than blood.", "NTA I just told my son he couldn't climb on me today bc I have cramps and my period. Hoping to raise a man that doesn't act like an idiot over bodily functions.", "NTA, but your baby daddy is. Periods are normal, and the more we normalize talking about them and what they do, the easier it becomes for uterus-owners to feel OK with them.", "NTA. Your SO needs to grow up. It\u2019s not like you were excessively discussing it or talking about it at the dinner table or anything if that nature.

Normalize bodily functions and your son\u2019s father needs to get over himself. It sounds like you had an age appropriate discussion with your child. There should be no shame in discussing basic anatomy.", "NTA. Obviously. If your ex thinks it\u2019s gross he can abstain from women permanently", "NTA.\n\nHe saw the blood. Did your partner expect you to lie to him?", "NTA. You didn't freak him out. On the contrary, you told him some normal fact that helped him not be concerned. What else should you have done?

Not sure how anyone could think otherwise.", "NTA\n\nThe nephew of my ex boyfriend loved having his diapers changed by me because I never told him that his poop was gross and always acted very happy to see that he went number 2 (he had a spell where he was constipated a bunch and his parents didn't want him to associate going number 2 with any kind of shame so this doesn't repeat on purpose one day).\n\nIt's a good thin to bring your son up with an understanding, that periods are not gross or scary, they're normal and natural. Avoiding the topic or keeping him away from it reinforces those stereotypes and he'll one day act like your husband (not blaming your husband, it was probably his upbringing - further proving my point)", "NTA - you kept it as loose as you could with out to much info which would be suitable for his age.", "NTA, the father has a horrid outlook on periods and think it's something that should be shunned, this fucked up view comes from not teaching kids about periods, break that cycle and teach your kid.

People like your immature partner are the reason men who are painfully ignorant about periods and the female body exist. And on a much larger scale, the reason why there are so many stupid old men making laws restricting the female body based on absolutely zero understanding about how it works.

Not all the time, but here and there. This particular time he came in, I was on my period. He noticed the blood in the toilet and on the pad when I got up to wipe and asked me what it was. I simply told him it was blood, but that it was okay and I wasn\u2019t hurt. He asked why there was blood and I told him to simplify it as much as I possibly could that sometimes girls bleed when they get older and it\u2019s normal. Then he asked if the blood came from my butt and I told him no and changed the subject. \n\nThe father of my child (24m) doesn\u2019t like that I had any of that conversation with him and claims it\u2019s gross. Doesn\u2019t want me discussing periods with him. I only explained to him so that he\u2019d understand that I was not hurt and that it\u2019s a normal thing some people with uteruses do. Especially since one day he could be a father to a daughter or a boyfriend or a husband. I don\u2019t want him to treat normal bodily functions like they\u2019re \u201cgross\u201d and not even be able to go buy his daughter/wife/girlfriend someday feminine products because of his thought that it\u2019s \u201cgross\u201d.

It\u2019s like OP\u2019s SO wanted her to tell the kid that she was mortally wounded or something.", "Knowledge transfer is the best way to normalize and destigmatize normal body functions. Over half the world's population has a uterus so it's not like your husband should be surprised by the existence of periods.\n\nKeep educating your little one, he'll benefit from it way more than he would being kept in the dark. NTA.", "NTA- you kept it simple for him so he didn't think something bad was happening to you.  Your kids dad needs to grow up though.", "NTA. It was an age-appropriate discussion, and over time he will gradually learn more. \n\nBesides, what alternative story that involves you bleeding would have been better?  A rule of thumb is that if I can't think of a way that another person could have acted that I'd have been okay with, that's a me problem.", "NTA", "Let me guess: your husband refuses to buy pads/tampons?\n\nNTA. The sooner everyone learns that periods are normal the better", "NTA - sounds like a very age appropriate conversation.  The father of your child however...is a child.", "NTA. People who menstruate need to explain it to people who don\u2019t entirely for this reason. Grown adults are grossed out by unused pads and tampons still in the wrapper and it\u2019s pathetic \ud83d\ude02There\u2019s a good chance your kid will at some point will live with someone who gets periods and this stupid cycle needs to end already", "NTA\n\nYour kid's dad is a giant baby though. This is how we get people who don't understand basic biology voting on women's bodies. Please keep your son educated for the women in his future life so that he's not embarrassing like his father.", "NTA\n\nmy ex refused to buy sanitary goods for me when I came out of hospital after giving birth.   Sitting in the car the day after the birth while I dragged my shellshocked body around the supermarket.  It was icky to him.\n\nMy DH now - 6' plus ex military non com and tough as nails has bought myself and my daughter tampons, pad and panty liners at different times.  Daughter had written our shopping list and left it on the fridge for me.  He needed something for what he was cooking and grabbed our list and called me at work to ask which brand DD used the first time.\n\nGood on you, making it matter of fact for your son is brilliant- particularly love his butt question. Boys and butts tell hubs to get over it", "NTA. Periods can be gross and often painful, when he\u2019s older any women in his life will thank you! It\u2019s also \u2018fun\u2019 when your small child pipes up \u2018where do babies come from\u2019 in the middle of the supermarket because a classmate has just become a big sister (she was 5 - I think).", "NTA", "So what it boils down to is that you had a age appropriate conversation with your son about bodily functions? Is that the gist of it?\n\nYea NTA. It's a period. You used child friendly terms you explained it in a simplistic way where he can understand that women goes through it ken don't etc and it's nothing bad. You aren't being hurt nor do you need a doctor etc. So basically the same conversation you'd have with a little girl just with your son.\n\nYour husband needs to get over it. I'm sure parents have had to have talks with girls about why their baby brother might accidentally get an erection during a diaper change or getting pull ups on etc. It's basic shit that happens that children that age cannot control. It's not sexual it's literally health class for toddlers.\n\nAlso I highly suggest teaching your son the proper terms for body parts not the old school terms (flower, cookie etc) because he needs to verbalize it right if something is wrong.\n\nAnd if your husband has a problem with THAT as well welp he can go ask the doctor why it's so important for a child to know correct medical terms for body parts and it's not just for abuse it's so they can say \"my (body part) hurts\" and no one is trying to figure out what that means.\n\nYou keep doing what you are. By normalizing periods it means they are less taboo to talk about and he could be the kid that can help a classmate talk to a teacher or nurse or just be the kid that gives the ones who act like it's taboo the side eye and ask them why they are so icked out by a bodily function when they talk about other functions that are grosser etc.\n\nYour husband's wrong. Your right. It was age appropriate and child friendly that's it.", "Your child was being more mature than your grown ass husband. Really, calling it \u201cgross\u201d? have a talk with him and explain his views on periods is childish and he needs to change them if he\u2019s going to be a parent. NTA", "NTA. \n\nNormalizing period talk is actually really important. Boy or girl, doesn't matter. Knowledge is power.", "NTA - My son has known about periods since he was very young and never thought twice about it. As a result, he has none of the usual male hang-ups over period products, which has been very helpful when I've needed tampons unexpectedly. You used age-appropriate language, kept it simple and non-scary, and reassured him that you weren't hurt. Great job, mama!", "Absolutely not.  Sounds like you gave him just enough information so he knew you were okay and left it to talk about it more when he's older.  Personally I think you should always be open and honest otherwise children won't come to you for advice when they are older.", "Even though my primary school was a CofE state school. It was next to a farm.\nAny kid who grows up in the countryside is aware of this stuff, how reproduction works, death and birth....\nNTA.", "NTA. You're doing a great job of explaining things in an age appropriate way. Your child's father is doing him a disservice by not wanting him to understand body functions. He also sounds like an immature jerk. Periods are not gross and unspeakable.", "NTA.  Half the world gets periods for at least part of their lives, it's silly to treat it like some taboo subject.  Talking about it matter-of-factly to kids is the way to avoid them growing up thinking that periods are 'gross' and somehow inappropriate.  Honestly, I think you're doing it right.", "Growing up,it was just me and a couple of gals (mom,sis) and they never censored \u2018girlie\u2019 discussions around me. Sure enough,a period is no more or less gross to me than peeing. My sig others over the years have always appreciated that.", "NTA.  It is important to educate children, regardless of their sex and gender, about natural bodily functions.  Your husband, however, is immature.\n\nHey, maybe your son might grow up to be a gynecologist one day!", "NTA nothing wrong in explaining biology  to your own child dad sounds like he could do with growing up a lil", "Jesus! Tell your husband to grow up. I have a son and husband and there is no way in hell I will raise someone who thinks periods are \u201cgross\u201d and I sure as hell won\u2019t live with one. Sex and periods are currently a very non-taboo and popular topic in our house right now, thanks to puberty and school sex Ed and my son will not be raised with these outdated, antiquated views about periods, breastfeeding or sex.\n\nYou are NTA!", "NTA obviously! What else were you supposed to say? You dealt with the situation well! Your partner needs to grow up", "NTA\n\n4 year olds have no context to think of it as gross and will just accept it as a thing that happens (as we all should). I\u2019m sure the kid quickly moved their attention on to something else.", "NTA it\u2019s always better to be truthful telling as much as you think they\u2019ll understand and that\u2019s what you did. I always told mine as much as I thought they would understand saying \u201cwhen you\u2019re bigger I\u2019ll explain it more ok?\u201d. Didn\u2019t ever have any problems doing it that way.", "NTA - it was answered in an age appropriate way and he happily went off to play now knowing that \u201cwomen bleed sometimes because they are women\u201d.\n\nBlood is scary for young children. The only time they see it is when someone is hurt. Them knowing that \u201csome times women bleed but that doesn\u2019t mean they are hurt\u201d  is enough to cancel any fear they may feel.", "ESH. Lock the door. That\u2019s raising a toddler 101. Why was he even in the bathroom long enough to get get a full view of the scene followed by a Q & A? A firm but polite \u201cMommy\u2019s using the bathroom right now\u201d, and making him leave immediately would have sufficed.", "Absolutely agree. I\u2019d rather my son be able to go out and get a package of pads from the store for somebody in his life if they need it rather than acting like the package was contaminated or something. My dad was a single dad for quite some time with me, it took him awhile to be able to pick up and purchase pads with his own hands for me without acting like it was uncomfortable or gross. Don\u2019t want that being my son.", "A DEMON COMING OUT OF THERE \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I\u2019m sorry, that sent me. But yeah he didn\u2019t feel like it was appropriate for our son\u2019s age and said that yes periods are natural but they\u2019re still gross. I disagree and don\u2019t want my son to think the same way.", "That\u2019s a very good point about the walking in thing, I\u2019ll start having discussions with him about privacy too", "This. It\u2019s important to teach kids that their privacy should be respected as well as others. Excellent teaching moment.", "Yes! I\u2019m on the same train of thought. I\u2019d rather my son be able to handle it without thinking it was gross in any way. After all, that whole process is what makes it possible for us to be brought into this world anyway, that shouldn\u2019t be a taboo.", "Door is broken currently so there\u2019s no lock but it does close", "Nope, OP is definitely NTA.", "Absolutely and also the language of using stupid words for genitalia needs to die too. Sorry this parts much darker but bothers me greatly. If someone sexually assaulted a child and then when the child gets the courage to tell an adult, the child then says something along the lines of \u201che touched my cookie\u201d, no one will understand the true meaning", "Frankly periods are gross to me too, I absolutely hate it & wish we didn\u2019t have to go through it but we do. We can\u2019t control whether or not we think something is gross but we can control how we respond", "It\u2019s even more \u2018fun\u2019 when you don\u2019t work properly but still get periods (our daughter confounded everyone, she shouldn\u2019t have been possible).", "Oh yikes!"]}
