He never had any apparent mental health problems previously. This popped up out of nowhere, unbeknownst to me was a result of some undealt issues from his upbringing. \n\nLuckily, my husband is an amazing provider so this didn\u2019t impact us much financially. It did however, create an emotional hardship having watched my husband fall apart while I aimlessly tried helping him. Our young child also does not understand what has happened to her dad. With that being said, mom, sister, and a close friend have been my three rocks through this. My mom especially, since her and my husband developed a tight bond. \n\nMy brother and his wife live in another state vacation here every year in January. They didn\u2019t know the entire story of what had been happening. I went to my mom\u2019s house to pickup my daughter, I had just got back in town from visiting him. My mom wanted know how were things, his progress, his demeanor\u2026basically everything. As we were discussing, my brother popped in from around the corner. Pretty much our entire family was there, I told him where my husband was and what happened. To which he responded, \u201cI always knew he was crazy.\u201d \n\nI think everyone in that house, including his wife was dumbfounded. He then tried deflecting that comment by saying, \u201cWell he\u2019s definitely crazy for marrying you.\u201d As if that would make things better, I completely went off. I guess my reflex was to sling dirt, I made a comment along the lines of actual crazy people [like him] having to pay for escort services because women always ran from him. \n\nHe look shocked I knew, honestly I don\u2019t even remember how I found out. My sister knew as well, but our parents did not. I ended up leaving with my kid, I later learned his wife didn\u2019t know about his old escort life, apparently she was mortified. My dad was livid with me, for divulging such a personal detail and causing a problem between them. He said I should have let my brother\u2019s \u2018dark humor\u2019 joke roll off my shoulders. I was still upset and told my dad it\u2019s not my problem he wasn\u2019t transparent before he married her. \n\nMy brother on the other hand, ended up sending me practically a kiss off letter saying I get what I deserve for marrying a f*ck up. Obviously he wasn\u2019t joking. I grew up having to ignore most of his idiotic behavior, but everything we had been through, it just struck a nerve and I snapped. My dad still won\u2019t speak to me, he tells my mom he doesn\u2019t care to hear about my husband. My brother (still in town) has requested I don\u2019t come around until he\u2019s gone. I\u2019m starting to feel I have to be the bigger person here and apologize, but at the same time they\u2019re not even bothering to cut me some slack.", "created_utc": 1672981325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104lcgc/aita_i_told_everyone_that_my_brother_used_escort/", "score": 2147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He made a joke about always knowing you were crazy, then doubled down and defended it by insulting you?! Yeah, he had it coming. And your dad is just as bad for enabling your brother's BS and trying to justify it as \"dark humor.\" Wouldn't that also make your comment dark humor?\n\nYou should NOT apologize to your brother, but I would apologize to his wife if I were you. Only for bringing it up out of her anger. Personally, I do think it's something he should have told her about.\n\nI would suggest going no contact with your brother, and the same (or MINIMUM low contact) with your father. You have too much to deal with right now, the last thing you need to deal with is that insensitive, inconsiderate asshole and the enabling, insensitive asshole who has decided to take sides (the wrong side, at that).

I would never shame sex workers by putting him in their category but I can tell you he did not pay enough to whoever had to endure him. My thoughts and well wishes to your husband and your family.

But him doubling down afterwards and making more comments definitely makes it seem like he was actually serious. \n\nYes. You probably should apologize for taking it that far.  But make it clear you expect an apology for his comments.  I also don\u2019t understand your dad. I get that he can be upset at the situation, but he also needs to give you a little grace.

He was thoughtless and hurtful to build himself up. You called it. You replied by calling out his own insecurity in front your family, unfortunately his wife did not know about the escort - not surprising, he probably feels a lot of shame thinking about it so never told her. \n\nI say technically ESH but I think you were a justified asshole. Mental health crises are often not given the full attention they should be, unfortunately. A lot of people still have the mindset of \"Why can't you just not be depressed? Pull yourself up by your bootstraps like an adult!\" Family avoid you like the plague once hospitals and institutions are brought into the picture. For whatever reason, it can be a plague that these family members can't get away from fast enough. After release, they want you to just ignore it and pretend it never happened. Maybe that's what's happening here. Maybe your brother and father don't understand why your husband, with a well paying job, wife, and child, would be having a mental health crisis. Talking about mental health is taboo. We deal with our issues like adults, and that's that. So, instead of trying to empathize and understand, it's just, \"Wow, he's less than for not being able to deal with his issues.\" Your father is going to have more allegiance to your brother, his son, and being insecure and getting escorts does not sound as lowly to him as being in a psych ward, so of course he is going to defend your brother. \n\nYour brother's behavior is not ok. Yes, you could have taken the high road and just taken it, but that sends the message he or anyone else that was there can continue to put you and your family down. He needed to be put in check. \n\nI am so sorry you are going through this. I wish your father and brother could see the toll it is taking on you and your daughter and choose to be loving and supportive rather than calloused and alienating. In the interest of your own mental health, it may be a good idea to go low contact while you are focusing on your husband's health, even if he works things out with your brother's wife. The last thing you, your husband, or daughter needs is to see people treat you as less than. I'm happy you have a support system and wish you and your family the best!", "ESH. You suck less because he started it. But 2 wrongs don't make a right. Slinging personal insults back stoops you closer to his level.

I don't think you have to apologize unless he apologizes first.", "ESH. This is really sad.\n\nEdit: I really don't get the N T A judgments. Your brother was a major dick. You were a dick in retaliation. You're both assholes.", "ESH, your brother obviously sucks and said something very hurtful. You hit back which didn\u2019t do anything to make your situation any better.", "ESH", "ESH. He was hurtful, you could destroy his marriage, and your father should not be taking his side or ignoring such a horrible statement from him. \n\nThat being said, I would've done the same and I don't think you need to send the first apology.", "Literally every single person, except your husband and mom, sucks.  You responded out of anger to an incredibly hurtful remark.  But going to his level, even if he started it, doesn\u2019t make it right.  If it is any consolation \n\nESH.", "ESH. His \"joke\" was clearly harmful, but I fail to see how your response did you any favors besides just making you the same as him.", "I\u2019d have to say it was a pretty asshole thing to do. Outing him and putting his relationship in jeopardy. He was being a Dick too and is definitely also at fault (asshole). The ramification of him being exposed can cause a crazy amount of issues compared to an Assholeish joke. Sad situation though hope you all can work it out somehow", "ETA\n\nYour brother for making an obviously insulting and insensitive comment. If someone says they go to the hospital for anything, your first response should be to check in on the people affected, not belittle their situation.  \n\nA YTA as well for lashing out at your brother and bringing up old dirt that was completely unrelated to the current situation. You could have addressed his thoughtless behavior alone since it was obviously bad. I'd reflect somewhat on why your first reaction to being hurt was to hurt someone else with the worst thing you knew about them. That's not a healthy way to cope with pain. \n\nAs for whether you should apologize or not...your call. It might be best to sort yourselves out first. Let him deal with his marriage and you deal with you and your husband's health. Once the dust settles, decide if you want to reopen the lines of communication. \n\nI'm very sorry your husband (and you) are going through a medical crisis, and I wish your husband health and recovery.", "ESH\n\nAnd eye for an eye and everybody's blind.\n\nYour brother was completely out of line.  \n\nYou were completely out of line.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It wasn't even dark humour, at least not good kind of dark humour and most of my humour is dark. His comment was absolutely wrong and he meant it, because why else mention it in front of the whole family, including his niece... Directly to the people suffering the most from it.\n\nAnd about being the bigger person... you don't have to. Often it can lead to certain behaviours to go unnoticed and without any consequence. Sometimes being the bigger person means to stand up for yourself and not apologise afterwards. Being the bigger person should not imply anyone having to roll over and begging for forgiveness. It's okay not to be the bigger person in the traditional sense, be it for yourself only.\n\nAbout your dad though, I am not sure how you can handle that.

But how dare you snap back at his hurtful comment lol", "i think IF your brother was joking at first, his second text was just him lashing out because of what you did . not saying you are wrong/right but just that i probably would do the same.. just to retaliate.. you also have to realise that if this is the first time he heard he might have had a knee jerk reaction/joke to makelight of it as he didnt know full story.. only you know ur bros behaviour ie humour\n\ni think if this is the only think he has done, maybe try patching up...", "YTA.\n\nNot for what went down with your brother, but because you're sharing your husband's private medical information with your family.  Personally, I would be \\*super\\* offended if, after dealing with a medical crisis, I found out my spouse had told literally ANYONE within earshot things even my own doctor couldn't divulge without my permission.

There's a harshness in my tone that reflects the stark reality of sex work. I do not like the glorification of it I see on Reddit. I agree, that sex workers are so much more than their profession (we all are) but it's not the glamorous, altruistic career people make it out to be. It's a profession that feeds off of both dehumanization and spite, from ends; the man who sees the woman as an object and the woman smiling falsely through gritted teeth, behind which lays starvation, at a man she actually finds repulsive. It's miserable. I very much feel the need to be blunt and not sugar coat it.", "someone who has actually experienced the dehumanization that comes with the job should be able to tell it as bluntly and harshly as they want without being language policed. no one who was not looking to nitpick and start UM ACTUALLY fights was offended.", "Every detail of his wife sex life?

The person making the clothes in the sweatshop is not a seller or a buyer, unlike the sex work analogy.\n\nIn your case, I would say that the person running the sweatshop, and selling the clothes, is in the wrong, and so is the person who's buying clothes that come from that sweatshop.\n\nIn the sex work case, I don't think there's anything wrong with the sex worker doing sex work, and thus likewise don't see anything wrong with the customer paying for the services of the sex worker.", "You don't need to feel compassion, empathy, and understanding to Johns. \n\n But if it's okay and there's nothing wrong with women being sex workers, then why is it not okay for men to partake in that sex work?

It regularly leaves workers with severe ptsd and physical health impacts. So I don't think selling sex is a good, empowering, or healthy choice however it is not a choice I judge victims for. \n\nVictims of domestic violence often go back to their abuser multiple times before leaving out of fear, desperation or manipulation. Are they making a good choice? No. But they shouldn't be shamed, the person who should feel shame is the abuser. \n\nSex isn't a human right and is not necessary for survival, thus there is no justification for buying it.

By buying it they're contributing to a system of abuse, not to mention how hard it is to verify who is a victim of trafficking or desperation.", "My family live in another state. I can assure you we are not from the US. States are not unique to the US", "I'm not pretending they don't exist, but you do also realize that that is not the entirety of sex work?
