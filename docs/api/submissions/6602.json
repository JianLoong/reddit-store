He never had any apparent mental health problems previously. This popped up out of nowhere, unbeknownst to me was a result of some undealt issues from his upbringing. \n\nLuckily, my husband is an amazing provider so this didn\u2019t impact us much financially. It did however, create an emotional hardship having watched my husband fall apart while I aimlessly tried helping him. Our young child also does not understand what has happened to her dad. With that being said, mom, sister, and a close friend have been my three rocks through this. My mom especially, since her and my husband developed a tight bond. \n\nMy brother and his wife live in another state vacation here every year in January. They didn\u2019t know the entire story of what had been happening. I went to my mom\u2019s house to pickup my daughter, I had just got back in town from visiting him. My mom wanted know how were things, his progress, his demeanor\u2026basically everything. As we were discussing, my brother popped in from around the corner. Pretty much our entire family was there, I told him where my husband was and what happened. To which he responded, \u201cI always knew he was crazy.\u201d \n\nI think everyone in that house, including his wife was dumbfounded. He then tried deflecting that comment by saying, \u201cWell he\u2019s definitely crazy for marrying you.\u201d As if that would make things better, I completely went off. I guess my reflex was to sling dirt, I made a comment along the lines of actual crazy people [like him] having to pay for escort services because women always ran from him. \n\nHe look shocked I knew, honestly I don\u2019t even remember how I found out. My sister knew as well, but our parents did not. I ended up leaving with my kid, I later learned his wife didn\u2019t know about his old escort life, apparently she was mortified. My dad was livid with me, for divulging such a personal detail and causing a problem between them. He said I should have let my brother\u2019s \u2018dark humor\u2019 joke roll off my shoulders. I was still upset and told my dad it\u2019s not my problem he wasn\u2019t transparent before he married her. \n\nMy brother on the other hand, ended up sending me practically a kiss off letter saying I get what I deserve for marrying a f*ck up. Obviously he wasn\u2019t joking. I grew up having to ignore most of his idiotic behavior, but everything we had been through, it just struck a nerve and I snapped. My dad still won\u2019t speak to me, he tells my mom he doesn\u2019t care to hear about my husband. My brother (still in town) has requested I don\u2019t come around until he\u2019s gone. I\u2019m starting to feel I have to be the bigger person here and apologize, but at the same time they\u2019re not even bothering to cut me some slack.", "created_utc": 1672981325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104lcgc/aita_i_told_everyone_that_my_brother_used_escort/", "score": 1307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He made a joke about always knowing you were crazy, then doubled down and defended it by insulting you?! Yeah, he had it coming. And your dad is just as bad for enabling your brother's BS and trying to justify it as \"dark humor.\" Wouldn't that also make your comment dark humor?\n\nYou should NOT apologize to your brother, but I would apologize to his wife if I were you. Only for bringing it up out of her anger. Personally, I do think it's something he should have told her about.\n\nI would suggest going no contact with your brother, and the same (or MINIMUM low contact) with your father. You have too much to deal with right now, the last thing you need to deal with is that insensitive, inconsiderate asshole and the enabling, insensitive asshole who has decided to take sides (the wrong side, at that).

I would never shame sex workers by putting him in their category but I can tell you he did not pay enough to whoever had to endure him. My thoughts and well wishes to your husband and your family.

But him doubling down afterwards and making more comments definitely makes it seem like he was actually serious. \n\nYes. You probably should apologize for taking it that far.  But make it clear you expect an apology for his comments.  I also don\u2019t understand your dad. I get that he can be upset at the situation, but he also needs to give you a little grace.

He was thoughtless and hurtful to build himself up. You called it. You replied by calling out his own insecurity in front your family, unfortunately his wife did not know about the escort - not surprising, he probably feels a lot of shame thinking about it so never told her. \n\nI say technically ESH but I think you were a justified asshole. Mental health crises are often not given the full attention they should be, unfortunately. A lot of people still have the mindset of \"Why can't you just not be depressed? Pull yourself up by your bootstraps like an adult!\" Family avoid you like the plague once hospitals and institutions are brought into the picture. For whatever reason, it can be a plague that these family members can't get away from fast enough. After release, they want you to just ignore it and pretend it never happened. Maybe that's what's happening here. Maybe your brother and father don't understand why your husband, with a well paying job, wife, and child, would be having a mental health crisis. Talking about mental health is taboo. We deal with our issues like adults, and that's that. So, instead of trying to empathize and understand, it's just, \"Wow, he's less than for not being able to deal with his issues.\" Your father is going to have more allegiance to your brother, his son, and being insecure and getting escorts does not sound as lowly to him as being in a psych ward, so of course he is going to defend your brother. \n\nYour brother's behavior is not ok. Yes, you could have taken the high road and just taken it, but that sends the message he or anyone else that was there can continue to put you and your family down. He needed to be put in check. \n\nI am so sorry you are going through this. I wish your father and brother could see the toll it is taking on you and your daughter and choose to be loving and supportive rather than calloused and alienating. In the interest of your own mental health, it may be a good idea to go low contact while you are focusing on your husband's health, even if he works things out with your brother's wife. The last thing you, your husband, or daughter needs is to see people treat you as less than. I'm happy you have a support system and wish you and your family the best!", "ESH. You suck less because he started it. But 2 wrongs don't make a right. Slinging personal insults back stoops you closer to his level.

I don't think you have to apologize unless he apologizes first.", "ESH. This is really sad.\n\nEdit: I really don't get the N T A judgments. Your brother was a major dick. You were a dick in retaliation. You're both assholes.", "ESH, your brother obviously sucks and said something very hurtful. You hit back which didn\u2019t do anything to make your situation any better.", "ESH", "ESH. He was hurtful, you could destroy his marriage, and your father should not be taking his side or ignoring such a horrible statement from him. \n\nThat being said, I would've done the same and I don't think you need to send the first apology.", "Literally every single person, except your husband and mom, sucks.  You responded out of anger to an incredibly hurtful remark.  But going to his level, even if he started it, doesn\u2019t make it right.  If it is any consolation \n\nESH.", "ESH. His \"joke\" was clearly harmful, but I fail to see how your response did you any favors besides just making you the same as him.", "I\u2019d have to say it was a pretty asshole thing to do. Outing him and putting his relationship in jeopardy. He was being a Dick too and is definitely also at fault (asshole). The ramification of him being exposed can cause a crazy amount of issues compared to an Assholeish joke. Sad situation though hope you all can work it out somehow", "ETA\n\nYour brother for making an obviously insulting and insensitive comment. If someone says they go to the hospital for anything, your first response should be to check in on the people affected, not belittle their situation.  \n\nA YTA as well for lashing out at your brother and bringing up old dirt that was completely unrelated to the current situation. You could have addressed his thoughtless behavior alone since it was obviously bad. I'd reflect somewhat on why your first reaction to being hurt was to hurt someone else with the worst thing you knew about them. That's not a healthy way to cope with pain. \n\nAs for whether you should apologize or not...your call. It might be best to sort yourselves out first. Let him deal with his marriage and you deal with you and your husband's health. Once the dust settles, decide if you want to reopen the lines of communication. \n\nI'm very sorry your husband (and you) are going through a medical crisis, and I wish your husband health and recovery.", "ESH\n\nAnd eye for an eye and everybody's blind.\n\nYour brother was completely out of line.  \n\nYou were completely out of line.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It wasn't even dark humour, at least not good kind of dark humour and most of my humour is dark. His comment was absolutely wrong and he meant it, because why else mention it in front of the whole family, including his niece... Directly to the people suffering the most from it.\n\nAnd about being the bigger person... you don't have to. Often it can lead to certain behaviours to go unnoticed and without any consequence. Sometimes being the bigger person means to stand up for yourself and not apologise afterwards. Being the bigger person should not imply anyone having to roll over and begging for forgiveness. It's okay not to be the bigger person in the traditional sense, be it for yourself only.\n\nAbout your dad though, I am not sure how you can handle that.

Or any future children.  \n  \nI do agree you should apologise to the SIL, since she got dragged into it.", "NTA don't apologize and tell your dad he can stay where the sun doesn't shine until he sees (and understands) his son's horrible behaviour.\n\nAnd please fuck that \"being the bigger person\". This usually just enables shitty behaviour and tells the other one that you can be treated like a doormat.", "Sounds like he needs to let your \u201cdark humor\u201d joke roll off his shoulders. NTA and I am so sorry, I hope your husband recovers and is home soon.", "Your brother made a nasty comment about your sick husband. He deserved all he got.\n\nNTA", "NTA go NC with brother and LC or NC with Dad that enables him and don\u2019t apologise you did nothing wrong, your brother wasn\u2019t joking and his lack of self esteem or jealousy issues towards better men is not your responsibility or problem. There\u2019s no point in explaining why or your feelings to people like your brother or dad in hopes of finding a solution.\n\nI hope your husband gets better soon and wish you all the best in the future. Stay strong", "NTA.  Your brother was an A\\*Hole and got what he dished served back.", "Honestly, I would just come around to piss him off. Because I\u2019m petty like that. And ableists don\u2019t deserve common courtesy anyway.\n\nNTA.", "I hope that wife of his gets herself checked for STDs.", "NTA \n\nHis wife had the right to know!", "NTA. Ignoring bullies and letting it \u201croll of your back\u201d just means more bullying usually. You stood up to him and he didn\u2019t like it, but that doesn\u2019t make it wrong. There may have been better ways to handle it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to act in self defense. I might apologize to SIL for how she had to find out about it, but in the end you may have done her a favor since he wasn\u2019t honest to her about it. Your dad\u2019s response makes me wonder if he has a similar secret, or just favors your brother.", "Your thinking is stuck in elementary school. Just because someone is awful to you, doesn't mean you can be awful back and claim you're not also an asshole.\n\nThis is the most clear cut ESH I've ever seen.", ">Maybe his son can do no wrong in his eyes and you as the not-golden-child should've kept your mouth shut and take him treating you like this.\n\nOr maybe using the escort argument as something brother should be ashamed of is, I don't know, \"slut shaming\"?\r\n\nTo be clear, OP's brother is a massive idiot; but OP's answer is like if a man said that a woman having an high \"body count\" is a symptom of mental illness.\n\nI'd go with ESH.", "Loved costumer instead of customer for SW patron  :)  We all need our costumes!", "I don't know how much of a favor she did the brother but that's ok", "This. This fucking this!\n\nLike wtf is wrong with people, just because someone was a dick to you, doesn't give you license to be a dick back.... That just makes you both assholes.\n\nESH", "Bigots don\u2019t deserve common courtesy.", "Dude I do not understand this sub half the time. The brother made a shitty insensitive comment yes, how does that justify OP humiliating him in front of their whole family??? Now OP has their shitty behavior validated by this sub.", "Definitely not the same. Mocking a sick man is miles different from being called out for hiring women to be a warm cum-sock. Wife has a right to know he's a creep.", "If his marriage is destroyed, it\u2019s on him for not being honest with his wife. If that\u2019s a dealbreaker for the SIL, then it seems more like OP did her a favor.", "He should have told his wife in the first place. That shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to her.", "This is what I think too. Far more likely that the brother was speaking what the father thinks about people who struggle too, and has nothing to do with the prostitutes.", "Im pretty sure that's behind his reaction, he firmly believes that going to escorts is a man's natural perogative, and he shouldnt be outed to his family about it to face undue and unfair consequences bc of it. Odds are the dad took the brother to his first escort too, and is indeed afraid the borther would out him too in an attempt to get his misery some company.", "Was thinking the same too.. Maybe dad the one introduced the brother how or where to get it... \n\nNta op", "That's exactly what I thought! Did daddy set son on to them?", "Yeah, this is kinda a gross sentiment, both from you and from OP.\n\nYou, and OP, are acting like using an escort service is something shameful, to be hidden. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with sex work. \n\nAnd by insulting the brother for partaking, she's basically slut shaming sex workers. Not cool.", "This. The ESH was so obvious I expected to find only those scrolling down for the comments.\n\nNot impressed.", "... ... if it should be or not, but using an escort service is still illegal as far as I know?\n\n\n\nConsensual and legal sex and using an illegal service with the possibility of human trafficking/modern slavery is not really equal.", "Except op isn't her brother so we have no idea what anyone had told him", "Even though I belive anyone is entitled to snap when being hurt, ESH.\nHow on earth OP's response is relevant to her brother being a dick? It's more mean towards SIL in first place.", "We also tell 9 year olds that their actions have consequences. And if you go out of your way to hurt someone it will have consequences.", "Standing up for yourself or fighting back when attacked doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.", "Ooh and all the unwanted advice people want to know they are the asshole not hear 800 strangers tell them to break up over a fight.", "That's a bit dehumanising towards sex workers, don't you think?", "He should have. But the question wasn\u2019t if he was the asshole or he would have been criticized too", "Not even outed to the family - all the *women*", ">Odds are the dad took the brother to his first escort too\n\nYeah, it's a weird \"coming of age\" tradition I heard of once. One of my uncles tried to pull that shit with me when I was 17, because my dad wouldn't do it and \"someone had to take care that the boy (me) becomes a man\", or some shitty reasoning like that. It strained our relationship, because he's a good man overall and was a nice counterpart as adult male role models, to my dad, because uncle is more even-tempered and my dad is more hot-tempered. After that event, I stopped considering my uncle as a good adult role model though.", "Grippy socks holiday. I\u2019m dying. \u2620\ufe0f I\u2019ve had two of those and will be referring to them as such from now on. \ud83d\ude02", "So if someone throws a punch to defend themselves after being punched in the face they\u2019re an asshole?", "Yes, like if you punch someone in the face you might get punched back. Consequences.\n\nAnd like,  if you are punched in the face and you punch them back, that person might bang their head and die and it will change you life. Consequences.", "If someone hurts you \u201cas a joke\u201d, then standing up for your self is to call it out. \n\nLashing out, especially if they hits hard and hurt s other people, Is understandable but is asshole move.", "Who was attacked he made a bad choice in what he said and so did she which the consequences of both are not equal he looked bad for saying it and everyone she could tell agreed it was shocking her response could end his marriage and the dismissal of that I think makes her more of an Asshole", "Uh, yes, it's absolutely dehumanizing. I know because I used to be an escort. I know first hand they see us as a \"warm cum-sock\" and not much more. The nature of the job itself is dehumanizing.", "If someone comes up to you, unprovoked, and punches you in the face and you defend yourself, and that person dies through a completely reasonable use of defensive force, then no you probably won't face legal consequences.", "Why is the person getting punched the one who is never allowed to retaliate? We tell people bullies are bad, but as soon as somebody is standing up to the bullies, they are also bad. How many punches must a person take until punching back is justified?", "> Lashing out, especially if they hits hard and hurt s other people, Is understandable but is asshole move.\n\n1. I agree with you in this particular case. OP didn't try anything else, they went with the nuclear option first.\n\n2. I don't think what you say is universally true. Some people just don't care about other people. The only way they can learn is by personally being hurt. I think people can use \"being mean\" as a communication tool of last resort without being an AH.", "1 - probably true, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s analogous to the OPs story or the example I was writing about.\n\n2 - I\u2019d suggest even if you were convicted it would negatively affect the rest of your life, so probably best to be avoided.", "Standing up to bullies is not punching back ? Or at least that's not the only way", "There are more than two options.\n\n> Why is the person getting punched the one who is never allowed to retaliate? \n\nBecause it might have negative life changing consequences. \n\n> We tell people bullies are bad, but as soon as somebody is standing up to the bullies, they are also bad. \n\nYes. Two people can fight / argue and both be wrong / assholes. The other person being wrong does not negate the fact that you are wrong / an asshole.\n\n> How many punches must a person take until punching back is justified?\n\nI\u2019d recommend almost every other option above being either a punch bag or fighting back."]}
