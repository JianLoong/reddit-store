Her ex is the very definition of a \"ne'er do well.\" He was arrested several times for DUI. He spends every penny he makes (when he can keep a job) on alcohol. When he cones over (uinvited), he's always asking for money. Just recently, he was in Florida with his latest girlfriend. He had, once again, spent every penny on alcohol and had no money to get back (they took a bus down there) to Delaware. He called my wife up about his situation. She suggested we send him a Money Gram to pay for a ticket. I said that he has borrowed nearly $2,000 from us and has made no effort to pay us back, so my answer was no. She started bawling and screaming at me, telling me what a bastard I was for not helping him in his time of need. I replied calmly, saying that I had no obligation to help him and that neither did she  because he's \"called your 'ex' for a reason.\" She responded by saying that he's her ex because she left him. I then explained to her that i meant that his title of \"ex\" means that she's no longer beholden to him. She screamed some mlre aboit what a terrible person that I am and kept arguing about until I \"Fine give him money but only from accounts that are in your nane exclusively. I'm no longer supporting him!\" Since all of our accounts are joint, there wasn't a way that she could do it. She tried getting her mom to give her the money to do so, and her mom said pretty much the same thing. In that case, she was \"Okay, i get  what you're saying.\" in a polite tone. However, I'm still a monster in her eyes.\n\nAITA for no longer being my wife's ex-husband's enabler?\n\nEdit: After work, I gave my wife an ultimatum . Some time back, I had to cut off things with a female friend because she was getting too close for comfort. I told her, \"Since I cut off  things with (we'll call her) L out of respect for our marriage and you threatened to leave me if I didn\u2019t, then (with turnabout being fair play) we're going across the street and you're going to tell him to no longer be in our lives or I'm divorcing you and throwing you out and you know that your family will take my side against you!\" She tried to get me to do it, but i told her that wasn't an option. I added, \"It's him or me!\" We went to his home, and she did the deed.

Eh, maybe, maybe not. I never loved mine.

Even if she thinks she's got all this under control (hah). This is such a toxic relationship dynamic. Eugh. \n\n*If she's feeling anything like I used to, she could in fact love you more than anything at all, and still do despicable things to you and other people she cares about in order not to feel like she's letting him down. For me, that *did* include sleeping with mine when I said I'd been done with that for years, because sex is another form of being useful (see, super unhealthy). It also included making excuses, giving money, enabling drinking and drug patterns, absolutely completely exhausting myself and my other relationships to ensure his mental health was taken care of, developing all sorts of stress responses to his situations, allowing myself to be manipulated, humiliated, endangered etc. \n\nIt was really tough on me when I first started saying no. I felt like I was breaking this huge promise to never let him down, and that I was letting him down so so badly, and that if anything happened to him, it'd be my fault, and that that's what I couldn't live with. At times, I wished he'd *die* so I had an easy out - I felt entirely trapped. \n\nIf your wife is going through this, she needs help you probably can't give her. She needs serious therapy. This is *dangerous*. This is clearly now harming her loved ones. \n\nMental health problems, and trauma, and all the mess it brings suck, but we have to be responsible for ourselves accepting help. \n\nThis is not on you, OP.

NTA", "Your relationship sounds incredibly toxic all around.", "NTA\n\nIn any case, it seems she does still want him. You aren't the only man in her heart.", "I posted an update if anyone is interested.", "NTA\n\nI'm sensing Lester Diamond vibes from the ex.", "You do know your wife occasionally fucks him, right?", "Nta.seems like she still has feelings for him that's some huge red flags with her acting that way", "NTA\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "ESH.  There is a complete lack of communication in your relationship and ultimatums are not a healthy tool nor are snarky comments about her spending her own money when you only have joint accounts.\n\nI am super curious why it got to this point and what else is going on.  \n\nI get being upset with the situation and wanting it to stop, but just the tone of your post makes you sound overbearing.\n\nThe NA response would have been to say ok (can clearly afford a bus ticket if he\u2019s already been given $2k) and that you no longer feel comfortable with this and you want to talk about it later, when things aren\u2019t as emotionally charged.  Find a solution you can both live with, without pushing each other around.", "NTA. That\u2019s\u2026very weird behavior from your wife. What\u2019s the deal? She\u2019s addicted to him needing her?", "NTA. And even if she caved to your ultimatum, I honestly think this marriage is already broken beyond repair.", "Especially seeing as she wanted \u201cL\u201d and you to stop being friends. I don\u2019t wanna be the one to say it but her suspicion may be projecting her own paranoia of getting caught cheating", "He even lives right across the street! Whenever OP is at work or out of the house, she can have a \"surprise visit\". \n\nNTA", "You live across the street from her ex?", "Dude! Are you serious ?????\nNo way in hell would I help. Make your life better. Dump that enabler. She still loves him. You are a free money ticket. You make me mad. \nYou sound like a very kind person. You aren't a door mat. Right ? \nHugging you.", "Yup. That's why it's kind of just tacked onto the end. It's unlikely, but would explain *some* of it", "He moved into a tralier park across the street from our house.", "Seems they also live across the street from each other still. Underlying other thoughts and or issues not mentioned? Who knows except them. Did she divorce him for the neighbor across the street? Still sleeping with the ex? Who knows but there's a lot more info needed. Still from this, op is nta for not wanting to continue any type of support for the ex.", "Sorry to be so blunt, but as soon as you go to work then she is over there or worse he is in your bed.\n\nOn the plus side if you two do split up you know she will always be there in the future to lend you money."]}
