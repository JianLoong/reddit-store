Her ex is the very definition of a \"ne'er do well.\" He was arrested several times for DUI. He spends every penny he makes (when he can keep a job) on alcohol. When he cones over (uinvited), he's always asking for money. Just recently, he was in Florida with his latest girlfriend. He had, once again, spent every penny on alcohol and had no money to get back (they took a bus down there) to Delaware. He called my wife up about his situation. She suggested we send him a Money Gram to pay for a ticket. I said that he has borrowed nearly $2,000 from us and has made no effort to pay us back, so my answer was no. She started bawling and screaming at me, telling me what a bastard I was for not helping him in his time of need. I replied calmly, saying that I had no obligation to help him and that neither did she  because he's \"called your 'ex' for a reason.\" She responded by saying that he's her ex because she left him. I then explained to her that i meant that his title of \"ex\" means that she's no longer beholden to him. She screamed some mlre aboit what a terrible person that I am and kept arguing about until I \"Fine give him money but only from accounts that are in your nane exclusively. I'm no longer supporting him!\" Since all of our accounts are joint, there wasn't a way that she could do it. She tried getting her mom to give her the money to do so, and her mom said pretty much the same thing. In that case, she was \"Okay, i get  what you're saying.\" in a polite tone.

I guess she feels guilty somehow that she 'abandoned' him. Even though it was probably his behaviour that drove her away.  She's clearly not over him. Why do you tolerate this? I'd end it.", "NTA you sure your wife isn\u2019t sleeping with him? Seems weird she constantly chooses his side over yours and calls you names.", "NTA and she is enabling her ex lol", "NTA. And this is just very odd. I don't think I could be married to someone like this.", "NTA\n\nIn what world you be the AH in this situation?", "NTA. Good for you!\n\nAnd you need to get most of your assets (bank accounts) into your name/assets and her name/assets, with only enough in a joint account for monthly bills. With her not being able to access yours, which she can do if everything is jointly held. So when she sends him money - which it sounds like she WILL - YOU will not be out any money.\n\nThe bigger question is, if she is still so enmeshed with him, do you want a  costly third party in your marriage? Some marriage counseling to make it clear to her  and you where loyalties lie would be helpful.", "NTA why is she still in contact with this toad? It doesn\u2019t seem like he adds any value to her life, he just uses her as an ATM when he\u2019s stuck. I understand being friends with an ex, but not like this.", "Yeesh. Your partner obviously didn\u2019t resolve her codependency with her previous partner before she married you. NTA\n\nI hope you can work it out. I had to completely cut my ex out if my life in order to heal.", "NTa. I\u2019d be reconsidering that marriage. Who knows what else she still gives him when you are not around, especially the way she reacted to you saying no.", "NTA\n\nThis story is pretty wild.  Not sure I believe it.", "NTA. Their codependency is not healthy.", "You're not required to loan money to someone who is going to spend it on alcohol and possibly drugs without ever repaying you.\n\nYour wife needs counseling.\n\nAlso going to recommend you lock down your finances ASAP.\n\nIf she thinks you're wrong for not sending him money, how long until she does it herself? \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe's an enabler. You don't have to be an enabler, too. She needs professional help.", "NTA. Your wife sounds like she may have some stuff that should be worked out with a therapist or something like Al-Anon. Co-dependency as the partner of an alcoholic is very common. She gave up the partner, but not her own codependent behavior.", "NTA. My guy, my dude, my bro. You have *issues*. \n\nYour wife is angry with you because you will not financially support *the man she used to be in a relationship with*. Forget the fact that they guy is a loser for a second. Why is she so invested in his life? Why are his problems hers? \n\n*She needs therapy*. Her mentality around relationships is so unhealthy that she is happy to make you upset, so long as her ex can continue to be a dropkick. Presumably, she left him because of these behaviours, and now she wants you to help fund them? And she wants to punish you by being distant when you won't comply? She thinks you're a monster for not enabling someone who *repeatedly* and *selfishly* puts the lives of themselves and those around them in danger. She isn't just an AH, she's *delusional*.\n\nYou didn't mention it, but I can only hope that she has young children with him, because at least then her behaviour is towards her kids' parent, not her ex. I don't normally lump myself in with the \"divorce them!!!\" crowd, but maybe she needs to see a \"healthy\" relationship with an ex.\n\nETA: spelling", "NTA.  I don\u2019t understand your wife.", "NTA OP does your wife seriously think it's okay for you to give this person money? Does your wife understand that this guy will not change his behaviour and he will continuously put you guys in a position where he has to call up asking for money?\n\nI don't want to be mean or rude, but OP your wife is a sucker. Ask her if she seriously intends on taking care of this man for the rest of her life and forcing you to go along with it? Is she okay with putting you in a financial position where you have to take care of someone else? Is it okay for her to judge you because you don't want to give someone money when they need help?", "[deleted]", "NTA. Your wife may have divorced him but she hasn\u2019t \u201cleft\u201d the relationship yet because she\u2019s still stuck in the toxic patterns from her last marriage.

She has a new life now and she needs to put up boundaries with her old one.", "NTA, but you do realize that she still loves him right?  Do what you want with that information.  I know what I would do.", "NTA but your wife still loves her ex. \n\nYikes, Get out while you can if you can.", "NTA. If my partner wanted me to give any money to one of their exes that would be a break up situation for me, so the fact you are still with her is very kind of you.", "NTA. you could be a little kinder in how you communicate it to your wife, who probably feels guilty about leaving this guy. but don't give him any more money. you're right.", "NTA. Sounds like your wife is not over her ex.", "NTA but your partner sounds as bad as her ex. This is not normal. She should not be enabling him, but then to be honest he shouldn't even be factoring into your relationship at all. He is clearly a toxic influence, and throwing money at him is only going to make him worse. While I do not know the full extent of your wife's relationship with that man, what you have described does not fill me with confidence.", "NTA...this is your wife's ex yes? Not her child? A sibling? Someone she has ties to?\n\nOP, you may need to do some thinking here. I don't know how long you've been with your wife, but she's clearly not over her ex.", "You\u2019d leave her if you had a set", "NTA your wife and the ex seem nice and seems odd he is still hanging around.

She's made her choice, give her a second ex.", "Info: Do they have kids together or shared property that bind them together?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur wife should be allowed to stupidly spend some money, even if it is for something as stupid as that.
