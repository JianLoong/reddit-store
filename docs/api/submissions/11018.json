My wife has a degree but never wanted to work and I work in software development so I\u2019ve been able to support our family just fine. We don\u2019t have kids yet, but we both want 2 kids. We\u2019ve been together since she was 19 and I was 20 (turned 21).\n\nI\u2019ve always been extremely money-conscious because my family didn\u2019t always have a lot, and even when my family did start moving up classes, I have always been conscious and stressed about money in a way that my younger siblings haven\u2019t been. For example, I won\u2019t ever waste food, I don\u2019t believe in overconsumption, I do research before purchasing things so I can get the most value out of them, I take really good care of what I do buy so it lasts me forever. Another example is that I never used to eat out very often, I prefer to cook to save money and eat out on special occasions.\n\nWe both knew the expectation for our marriage would be for me to support us going in and she would be a homemaker. She said she preferred me to take care of the bills, taxes, and such so I do that as well. She cooks and cleans (or she did) and she would be home for our future kids.\n\nMy wife is on my credit card account and she buys everything for herself on there. She has buying a LOT because I didn\u2019t set a limit (I didn\u2019t want to control her). Like tons of designer items, she bought 4-5 items around $400 from a company called Skims. Tons of skincare from Sephora, etc. \n\nSo now I set a limit saying only $100 on clothes monthly, groceries and food were unlimited as long as we used everything that she was buying since I didn\u2019t want anything to go to waste.\n\nAnother thing is that she begged me for an expensive gym membership at a nice gym. I said okay because she said she would go everyday (I go to the gym everyday but I\u2019m a simple dude so just a basic gym). This gym is like 30 times the price of my gym or something and in 6 months, she\u2019s gone just seven times. I kept telling her I want to cancel it because it\u2019s money down the drain but each month was going to be THE month where she started going. \n\nThe last issue is that she has gained a ton of weight and so has said that the reduced clothing budget is not enough to buy her a whole new wardrobe. It\u2019s so silly but I went to my car and cried because I swear she has so many clothes and they might be a little smaller now (I can\u2019t tell a difference) but she doesn\u2019t even go outside often. Like the last time she went out was to get groceries and I take a her on a dinner and fun date every other week.\n\n\nThe thing is that I just have a lot of expenses I\u2019m helping my family pay for my grandmothers medical expenses (different country) and my dream of owning a custom house that I\u2019ve designed is going down the drain, a dream she knows about and was supportive of.\n\nShe yelled at me when I said to reduce expenses and that I\u2019m canceling the gym membership, saying I\u2019m controlling her.\n\nAITA for reducing my wife\u2019s expenses?", "created_utc": 1677447267, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ctfeb/aita_for_reducing_my_wifes_clothing_budgether/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As it is, she worked as soon as I could stay home alone, and always did house cleaning and laundry a few hours a week as well (for others).\n\nSo I'm not hating on the SAHM role either, bc women can save their families in that role.\n\nBut this wife needs to get her butt to work.

You can't fix lazy.  Don't let her baby trap you, which she may try to do if you demand she contribute.", "Yes, it occurs to me Wife may choose now as the time to baby-trap Husband. She doesn't have anything else to do with her time, it will get her more attention, and it will (she thinks) nail him down for good. Double up on the birth control, OP!", "No, I want to own my house first. Its been a dream of mine to own my own home and architecture is a side passion I\u2019ve been designing a home for so long. She knows I want to have a home before we have kids. \n\nAnd I just told her can we please reduce clothing budget", "It\u2019s not that me being simple made me cry. I just felt overwhelmed that she knows what I\u2019m going through with my family, my sister, how I\u2019m paying so much towards them, how my plans for moving into a home/starting having kids get impacted by money right now, and then asking for even more money when she has like so many clothes already", "She didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with the budget. She said she didn want to work (she never worked after graduating) and I said I respected that because I didn\u2019t want to be pushy\u2026", "Much like someone else commented, she's taking advantage of you. Sounds like you both need to sit down and have a good chat about life, goals and expectations.", "the deal was that she would do house wifey stuff if you financially supported her right ... and she is no longer doing that tell her she either needs to get a job or go back to your arrangement", "That's good, but I hate to break it to you, but happy people who are happy with their lives don't have therapists. I don't know how you could bring those issues up carefully.", "\"She didn\u2019t want to.\" Did your wife ever suggest how she intended to fill the hours in the day? I almost cannot believe you said she spends time on TikTok and other online idiocy---but yeah, you said it. \n\nDoes she ever think about, you know climate change? Sustainability? Saving the Earth? Getting out the Vote? Feeding the poor? Why she was born? The reason we're here? Does she worry about how her parents and sibs are getting on? Does she keep up with current info relating to her college studies? Does she ever think about anything other than herself? (Clearly she doesn't waste a lot of time thinking about you, but, oh yeah, she's a good date.)\n\nYou wouldn't be controlling her if you suggested she get a job. You'd be giving her the opportunity to use her talents on something more worthwhile than TikTok. The way you just blow off her whole existence suggests that she's a lot less real to you than that house you want to build.", "Ah in that case then she\u2019s being intentionally disrespectful and some hard convos will need to happen", "Maybe it\u2019s time to ask her to get a job. She\u2019s apparently a homemaker but in reality she\u2019s lazy and just wants to spend your hard earned money no matter what it\u2019s costing you. I think y t a to yourself for agreeing to this situation.", "You need to have a hard conversation about your different approaches to money, probably mediated by a professional - therapist, counsellor, whatever.\n\nIn the meantime, I'd suggest moving your house savings into an account your wife can't access - she may complain about that being \"controlling\" and perhaps it is, but if she continues along the path you've described, you will have no cushion for emergencies.", "Sounds like you need to find yourself a partner that\u2019s actively working to build with you. Stress kills, it\u2019s too many people on the earth for you to be crying in the car over this lady. If she\u2019s expensive then the kids are definitely going to double it. Maybe take some time off and cancel those cards. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think you need marital counselling, not AITA. You want to have a home you design before you have kids, but what does she want? And why do you have to do that before having kids? Maybe she was supportive when you first married but she changed her mind? Maybe she'd rather save for the house and spend lots and lots on clothes and not support your family.\n\nRight now it seems like neither of you is an asshole but you need to get on the same page.", "That\u2019s what I meant: I picked up on your sense of being overwhelmed. As your wife, she needs to show some empathy. Clothes? I love them. But I buy my own. So should she. You really cannot get much for $100 per month.", "She has had a therapist since she was young for anxiety\u2026.I have friends who have therapists to stay happy, not because they are unhappy. Therapy is for everyone\u2026.", "That\u2019s stupid. Many people go to therapy just because it good to go to therapy. To say people with happy lives don\u2019t go to therapy is the stupidest shit you could\u2019ve said.", "OP, your wife sounds alot like me when I hit a depression hole, luckily I was able to get out of it. Maybe she's uncomfortable talking to you about it, I was as well because from the outside everything was fine,  but I was depressed anyway. Talk to her or schedule a group session.", "Would you say that it's currently working well?", "Yes, that's a measured response of a well adjusted person.", "Okay I mean I didn\u2019t put all this in the post but she seems very happy. My only issues (and she knows this) are that 1) she spends a lot of money on things that don\u2019t seem worth it to me or that she doesn\u2019t get much value out of 2) she doesn\u2019t cook anymore\n\nOtherwise she has been keeping the apartment clean, it\u2019s our bedroom, bathroom & a pretty big living room and balcony, kitchen, etc.\n\nAnd she is always happy to see me at the end of the day when I\u2019m home and she is happy to go on dates, and she is always a good listener to me since I\u2019m dealing with lot of stress at work, with my family situations, my younger sister just had some really messed up stuff happen to her so she has been someone for me to talk to since hearing that about my sister has been tough", "That doesn\u2019t address my point. You\u2019re retort is a logical fallacy. But sure, let\u2019s play your game. It\u2019s an online open forum. \n\nIn general, responses aren\u2019t going to measured in some sense of decorum besides not being a complete dick.", "That's great, but her shopping behaviour still doesn't seem healthy to me and I say this as somebody who does quite a lot of online shopping.", "Well, you failed by your own standard then. Bye.", "Don\u2019t get mad because you\u2019re wrong."]}
