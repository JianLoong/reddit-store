I understand that it seems like not a huge deal to end a relationship over and I'm not suggesting you unnecessarily humiliate him. But keep your eyes open. Some issues are related to other issues. Some issues get worse, not better, with time. If he has a medical/neurological issue that makes self-care and hygeine difficult, which is not uncommon, it is ok as a partner to ask that they work on finding real solutions that work with their limitations.

She thought it would be a hilarious prank to move her giant shit into the litter box and make him think their little cat had done it. I assume she used gloves. Anyway, a few hours later he yells from the bathroom in shock at what the \"cat\" has left and she starts laughing and admits what she did. He agrees it was a good prank and laughs too. \n\nBut a few weeks later he broke up with her.

I still need to learn how to properly clean a bathroom, and today I spent $190 fixing a sink clog that turned out to just be a really gross and dirty drain plug (something I could have fixed probably if I'd checked basic problems before hiring someone) and a bunch of other things, but... I at least haven't been THAT bad about making a mess in the bathroom, at least not since hitting the age of five. Even floor pee is really unacceptable, who wants to live in a house with a bathroom that's about as welcoming as a public restroom in the subway?\n\nMy partner and I had to navigate a bunch of related things though. Here's my two cents: it's important to look at this kind of like a business team. There's tasks needing to be done, and to not have any redundancy built-in, you're setting yourself up for failure. What if you've got a deliverable in a week and your coworker gets hit by a car, or gets really sick? You're fucked if you aren't set up to take on their work too temporarily. It's a huge handicap to have partners in a house that aren't BOTH capable of mostly keeping things running. My partner had major surgery earlier this year for endometriosis, and it went badly enough that recovery started with a month of bedrest, and it was another month or two after that even before we could even start to talk about getting back to our old lifestyle. If I wasn't fully equipped to get our kid ready for school, keep the kitchen clean, meal plan, keep the house clean, interface with our house cleaner and landscaper and keep them paid, and the million other things needing doing...  all my own work, plus hers in other words. If I couldn't pull both our weight for a while, we'd have been in serious trouble, because she wasn't capable of doing any work at all temporarily for serious health reasons. My not being capable because I never acquired those skills is far less acceptable.\n\nI didn't get my driver's license until I was 30 or something (chronic fatigue/undiagnosed ADHD/serious depression and so on) but you can't be a husband and a father while also being a child. It sets a terrible example for a kid, it causes the partner to have to be a parent instead of... you know, a partner, it's real bad.\n\nI at least didn't argue that the things I couldn't do were things I shouldn't have to do. You should put your foot down about starting regular couples therapy, if you're intending to stay with him. I'm grateful I had the time and support I needed to grow up into a (largely) fully functional adult now, but there were a lot of years that would have been a lot better if I'd been forced to get serious earlier. If he's incapable or unwilling, you need to decide what kind of a lifestyle you want to live, but it sounds like your sexual attraction isn't likely to stick around long term if this is the best he's planning to bring to the table, so you do need to be serious about fighting for change if you don't want to end up either leaving or resenting him. It sounds like the improvements needed are a whole lot more pervasive than just this after all, and 'growing up' takes a lot more time than 'improve this one single skill set', so you need to start now to see if he's ready willing and able. Even if he is it'll probably be a year or two on the way.", "He doesn't read, it was in between two pages and made like 8 pages stick together bc it seeped through.
