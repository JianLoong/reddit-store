{"id": 28013, "submission_id": "16x69z3", "title": "AITA for not wanting to invite my atheist niece to my son's bar mitzvah?", "selftext": "To give some background. I have 3 kids. A 12 year old boy. A 9 year old boy. A 6 year old girl. I also have a 17 year old stepson that moved in with us when he started high school. I am Jewish, my husband is agnostic but was raised Jehovah's Witness, and my stepson is agnostic. We are raising the 3 kids we have together in the Jewish faith. \n\nMy husband and his sisters have a complicated relationship with religion. They were raised JWs until my husband was 11. His mom died a few years before that and his dad ended up leaving the church. They went to a nondenominational Christian church after that. My husband's younger sister has a 15 year old daughter, who I will refer to as Kayla from now on. \n\nKayla is a great kid. She is big on social justice issues and dreams of being a civil rights attorney. She is always striving to educate people on issues. We have had great conversations about race (my husband and his family are black) and sexuality (she is pansexual). The issue of religion is a big one though. She has openly told me she thinks it is gross that I am raising our younger kids with religion and that I still celebrate around my stepson, even though he isn't Jewish. FWIW, my stepson says he doesn't care about religion and likes being included in our celebrations. We also celebrate traditional Christian holidays like Christmas because my husband and stepson love Christmas. After I sent out invites to my son's bar mitzvah she made a social media post about how religion is nothing but brainwashing kids and how she can't wait to see religion eradicated. I said something to her about it and she followed that up by making another post about how religious people are always trying to quiet everyone else and how she will never be silent in the face of the oppressor. I told my husband that if shs feels this way about me then I really don't want her at a religious celebration. I only mentioned it to my husband and our best friends so far and my husband is upset that I am trying to exclude her. I feel like she clearly does not respect religion and therefore should not come to a religious ceremony. I haven't said anything to her yet. Should I or would that be an asshole move?\n\nEdit: thanks fir the comments. I decided that I will have a talk with Kayla on being respectful at the bar mitzvah. If she feels like she won't be able to keep her religious opinions to herself then she should she stay home because we want this to be fun. If she feels like she can be quiet about it then she should come because we would love to celebrate with her.", "created_utc": 1696179298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16x69z3/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_my_atheist_niece/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We all have the right to our beliefs, but we have to respect eachother no matter what someone else believes. You respect that she is not religious, but she does not respect that you are religious. You need to have a conversation with her about learning to respect you despite you both having different beliefs.\n\nAs for the celebration, say to her that she is welcome to come if she is respectful, but if she is not comfortable going then she doesn\u2019t have to. \n\nNTA at all.", "Info: does she just post her opinions/feelings or does she actively talk with you kids about religion and tell them their beliefs are wrong?\n\nIf she will be polite and respectful at your son\u2019s bar mitzvah, then I\u2019d invite her. Who cares what she personally thinks, if she\u2019s not trying to ruin the event or being rude to your children?\n\nIf she does bring up her opinions/feelings at events, then don\u2019t invite her. Your son\u2019s bar mitzvah is special and shouldn\u2019t be ruined by someone arguing about his beliefs. \n\nBased on your post, it sounds like Kayla debates issues online and with adults. You said you\u2019ve had great conversations, so it doesn\u2019t sound like she would try to ruin the event. Is she usually respectful to your children? If so, I don\u2019t see the problem having her present.", "Nta. Im an athiest but I respect the opinions of others. Kayla hasn't learned how to be mature and respectful of others. She would probably make the event negative or other guests uncomfortable given how vocal she is about her feelings", "I understand your concern, but by not inviting her, you'd likely create more family drama.\n\nAlso, what exactly did you say to her post?\n\n>I said something to her about it\n\nThis feels purposefully vague.", "Most Jews I know are atheist. Bar mitzvahs can be about welcoming the young adult into the community not necessarily just blindly following faith. There's even usually a chance for them to give a little speech on what they learned and what it means to them. I've rarely seen a 13 year old talk about religious epiphany, etc - it usually focuses on family and community, overcoming challenges and typical teenager stuff.  \n\nAlso 15 year olds are always acting like little fucks, telling to be combative and subversive.  She's testing her own boundaries. Have a chat with her and see if she would be interested in coming. It would be an asshole move if you disinvited a 15 year old from an event just for acting like a 15 year old.", "Kayla has some growing up to do, right now she is a very judgmental teenager who doesn't know jack about life. If you think she will disrupt the ceremony, disinvite her. She made it clear that she will criticize the ceremony if she feels like it, so if that offends you then you are NTA.\n\nOn the other hand, this might be an opportunity for her to share in an experience that goes against her world view. I think the problem here is that you are treating Kayla like an adult. She's not.

If she can't promise to do that, then she's not invited.  My guess is if she wants to go it's for the party.\n\nRespect for freedom of (or from) religion goes both ways.  She's young and hasn't fully grasped that yet I think, but it may be possible to explain that and see how she responds.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.    \nI'm an agnostic/ deist, and while I'm certainly not a fan of religion, I do understand where you're coming from. If she's going to post on social media about how terrible religion is, then there's absolutely no reason to invite her to what is a religion based ceremony. It would be hypocritical of her to attend, anyway.", "NTA. Athiest Jew here who was bat mitzvah'd. Saying all religions should be eradicated in response to a Jewish tradition is ignorant and genocidal, even if that is not what this girl intends. The Jewish people are not bound together by a religion, but by our shared cultural heritage and ancestry. We're also an ethnicity. Judaism is an ethnoreligion. You can be an atheist Jew, like myself and most of my family. We celebrate holidays with an emphasis on history and culture and tradition, and minimize the god part of it all. No matter what I believe, I will always be part of the Jewish community. \n\nI really wouldn't want someone at my event if they can't respect my culture.", "I'm going to say Nta on not inviting her. \n\nWhere I personally agree that we're at a time in history where organized religion is causing more harm than good, it's your choice. She's at the age, and sounds like the type of person, that wants to turn everything into either a debate, or a protest, and she (if she's as you described her) will no doubt make a scene if she attends.\n\nYou're n t a as long as you let your children leave your religion if they so choose. No guilting then, no disappointment, no cutting them off, just accepting that they can walk their own path and believe what they want.", "NTA.

She's anti religious, why would she want to go to religious ceremony?", "I don't think you understand how badly JWs mess with your mind and thoughts. It is extremely common for people who were forced to be JWs (and she was) to go in the extremely opposite direction when it comes to religion. There is a lot of trauma, of all kinds, with JWs. Please don't everything she says personally because there is a lot of pain there and her coping is to lash out.

Ask her if she wants to be there to celebrate your son. It kind of feels like you're just seeking a confrontation.\n\nDoes your son want her to be there for his celebration?\nDoes she want to be there for your sons (religious) celebration?\n\nIt sounds like much of your family is, at best, lukewarm on religion. You even say your son himself, isn't really religious? So for whom is this a problem? Just you? Shouldn't you then try to act like a grown-up?\n\nYes, it's rude of Kayla to post anti-religious stuff if it is done in response to getting an invitation to a religious event.\n\nBut the big difference is that she's a teenager. Teenagers are rude. They don't always consider the feelings of others.\n\nAnd because of that, you're trying to work _behind the scenes_ to exclude her from the event.
