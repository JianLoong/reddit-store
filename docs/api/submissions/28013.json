A 9 year old boy. A 6 year old girl. I also have a 17 year old stepson that moved in with us when he started high school. I am Jewish, my husband is agnostic but was raised Jehovah's Witness, and my stepson is agnostic. We are raising the 3 kids we have together in the Jewish faith. \n\nMy husband and his sisters have a complicated relationship with religion. They were raised JWs until my husband was 11. His mom died a few years before that and his dad ended up leaving the church. They went to a nondenominational Christian church after that. My husband's younger sister has a 15 year old daughter, who I will refer to as Kayla from now on. \n\nKayla is a great kid. She is big on social justice issues and dreams of being a civil rights attorney. She is always striving to educate people on issues. We have had great conversations about race (my husband and his family are black) and sexuality (she is pansexual). The issue of religion is a big one though. She has openly told me she thinks it is gross that I am raising our younger kids with religion and that I still celebrate around my stepson, even though he isn't Jewish. FWIW, my stepson says he doesn't care about religion and likes being included in our celebrations. We also celebrate traditional Christian holidays like Christmas because my husband and stepson love Christmas. After I sent out invites to my son's bar mitzvah she made a social media post about how religion is nothing but brainwashing kids and how she can't wait to see religion eradicated. I said something to her about it and she followed that up by making another post about how religious people are always trying to quiet everyone else and how she will never be silent in the face of the oppressor. I told my husband that if shs feels this way about me then I really don't want her at a religious celebration. I only mentioned it to my husband and our best friends so far and my husband is upset that I am trying to exclude her. I feel like she clearly does not respect religion and therefore should not come to a religious ceremony. I haven't said anything to her yet. Should I or would that be an asshole move?\n\nEdit: thanks fir the comments. I decided that I will have a talk with Kayla on being respectful at the bar mitzvah. If she feels like she won't be able to keep her religious opinions to herself then she should she stay home because we want this to be fun. If she feels like she can be quiet about it then she should come because we would love to celebrate with her.", "created_utc": 1696179298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16x69z3/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_my_atheist_niece/", "score": 823, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If so, I don\u2019t see the problem having her present.", "Nta. Im an athiest but I respect the opinions of others. Kayla hasn't learned how to be mature and respectful of others.

If she can't promise to do that, then she's not invited.  My guess is if she wants to go it's for the party.\n\nRespect for freedom of (or from) religion goes both ways.

Please don't forget Kaylas parents grew up in one of the most viciously abusive religious cults that exist. She's 15 and is angry at religion. This is completely her right, seen what background she has. However her fervor is a bit over the top, on the other hand, I know MANY people who were atheists who were incredibly combative in their teens who mellowed when they were older and mature. Part of it is just her being a teenager. I know I shared Kayla's opinions when I was 15 and a lot of it was just talking big and wanting to feel important. I would genuinely be nice to religious people as long as they were decent and respectful to me.\n\nShe is partially misdirecting her anger towards you, of course, but on the other hand she's just a teenager talking big. It's like a young lad filming himself swishing a katana about. It doesn't mean he'll go on to attack people in real life. Raging on facebook isn't the same as actually not behaving at an event like this.\n\nSo I think your approach to have a talk with her is the best idea.", "Speaking as an Agnostic who very much dislikes organized religion, definitely NTA. She is free to believe in what she likes, same as you and everyone else, but chastising others for their beliefs and practices (barring legit harmful/dangerous stuff) is not okay.", "I don't know whether this helps, but traditional Judaism is a religion of orthopraxy, not orthodoxy. \n\nIn plain English, Judaism is a religion where what matters is what you do, not what you believe about it. \n\nIf you have faith, good for lucky you! \n\nIf you have faith but waver - not a problem! The important thing is that you keep gods commandments.\n\nIf you are an atheist devoid of faith - that's sad but not religiously problematic. Judaism has no hell. Your degree of faith has no bearing on how God will judge your life. It is how you live your life that matters. \n\nClassical Judaism is also a religion that welcomes inquiry. There's an extra biblical story I can't access now and I fear  I'm going to mangle...but it goes something like this:\n\n3 rabbis are sitting around a table studying Talmud (which is a little bible and literally thousands of years of commentary on it - the thoughts of generation after generation of scholars). \n\nThey have a heated discussion about the passage they are studying. And deeply disagree. \n\nCertain his interpretation is correct, one of the rabbis in frustration calls on God to settle the argument. \n\nAnd to their amazement god appears. \"My son Yitzak is right\" a voice booms. Then the glory disappears, the room goes silent, and the three scholars sit in quiet stunned awe. \n\nAfter a long time Yitzak breaks the silence. \"So we agree I am correct\" he said confidently. \n\n\"Not so fast,\" said the other two. \"For it is written that Moses received the written and the oral law directly from God. But that after he received it we humans would interpret it.\"\n\nLong story short, they ruled god out of order and his comment irrelevant. \n\nThat story has a couple of points. \n\nOne is, it is up to us humans, now, to figure out the nuts and bolts of how to lead a good and righteous life. Direct revelation from God is no longer a thing. God wants us to use his prior revelations to figure it out as best we can ourselves. And understand that we are seeing through a glass darkly and will disagree and get it wrong. \n\nThe other is how we figure out the best way to lead our lives: through argument. At times heated, but perfectly kosher when sincere. God wants us to ask questions, wrestle with ideas, and reach our own conclusions. \n\nIn other words: your bratty niece is displaying a very Jewish open mind and willingness to live by what she believes. \n\nAnd as your son is a bar mitzvah - a man within the religion - and celebrates it, I can think of few things more appropriate than inviting as a guest someone who will challenge his thinking by questioning received wisdom.\n\nBut don't take my word for it - ask your rabbi. \n\nIn fact, ask several. \n\nAnd if asking five rabbis provides your son with six different answers - congratulations! He is now a Jewish man. \ud83e\udd73\ud83d\udc96", "NTA for certain but while your niece is being the AH it sounds like she\u2019s doing what many new atheists do and act like they need to attack religion at every turn. Usually they mellow out and recognize that there is a time and place for getting on their soapbox. \n\nI\u2019m an atheist myself and I find Jewish culture fascinating. But I live in a country where those who identify as Jewish make up about 0.16% of the population so you guys are like freaking unicorns. \n\nI hope your niece is able to learn to be respectful and can enjoy the festivities.", "Honestly, it isn't that big of a deal.

Teens are known for their black and white, all or nothing reasoning. The bar mitzvah is equivalent in her mind to the indoctrination she faced as a child, no exceptions, no nuance.
