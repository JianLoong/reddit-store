Me and His mother, Laura, had him at 15, we havent been together since we were 18, but we co-parented nicely together. Well 3 years ago, sadly Laura died in a car accident, she was hit by a drunk driver. This was really hard on Mj of course, but he is doing better now with therapy.\n\nIn the midst of everything going on with Luara's death, I met Emi, we became good friends and started dating a year after we met. Everything seemed alright, she seemed extremely understanding of Mj's situation and never was pushy with Mj, always gave him the space he wanted, until now.\n\nI proposed to Emi on sunday and after the proposal it was like she flipped a switch. That night we went back to my and Mj's house where everything was going great. But when I was in the kitchen while Mj was in his room, I heard him yell, I ran to see what was happening and I saw Emi taking the pictures of Laura from Mj's room down. Mj asked what she was doing, and she said \"She's not here anymore Mj, now that im marrying your dad, I'll be your mom.\" Which to me isnt true. Laura will always be Mj's mom dead or not. I noticed Mj getting more and more upset since she wouldnt hand over the pictures. I was getting frusturated, and without thinking I told her to get out of my house. This shocked her and caused her to cry and storm out, of the house. This past week her friends and a few of her family members have been calling me an ass, im starting to feel terrible for making her cry, but she cant just take Mj's things. so AITA?\n\n(p.s.

Or do they just think you two had a quarrel and you told her to get out?!  \n\n\nIt sounds like she was waiting for the proposal and she had wanted to do that for quite some time.   \n\n\nNTA - and I'd be having a very serious chat with her about this and saying if this is the way she's going to be behaving then she isn't the woman you thought you were proposing to.", "NTA\n\nFor your son and sanity please don't marry this woman", "NTA\n\nshe was totally out of bounds.... that's too big of a red flag to consider marrying her imo.", "She\u2019s delusional lmao, you done nothing wrong and I hope your son is okay :)", "Dear god, NTA!!

You need to pump the brakes on this marriage until you are 100% sure Emi understands her role in the household and it is NOT Mj's mom.  And she should NEVER, EVER be allowed to march into his room and start removing pictures, etc. of his mom.  I'm not sure you can salvage this.  She's shown who she truly is.", "NTA. I consider Laura's behavior a pretty big red flag for you. It's not, say, her wanting to take down a pic of yr ex that you might have had up. It's taking down the pics the son has of his mother!

If you did marry (and I'd rethink that...) she'd be his parent, and certainly sons/daughters can become close w/a step parent.

Not confusing.

This is 100% unacceptable behavior on her part. \n\nThe only issue I see here is that simply telling Emi to get out of your house doesn't address the real problem, and as a result you missed that opportunity. You need to make it very clear to her that MJ will always come first for *you,* that Laura will *always* be MJ's Mom, and nothing that Emi can ever do will change that. If she is very lucky, she can perhaps become a *second* Mom to MJ (I'm personally of the opinion that you can never have too many loving parents, grandparents, etc.), but never a replacement.\n\nThat is, of course, if you think there's any chance that she's willing to put in the work to develop that relationship and create that role for herself. If she's not willing to accept that, and if you think she's going to persist in this nonsensical idea of traying to erase his mother from his life, there's really only one way to handle it: Break off the engagement, and wish Emi a happy life somewhere far away from you and MJ.", "> \"She's not here anymore Mj, now that im marrying your dad, I'll be your mom.\" \n\nIf I heard this from my fiance, that would be the end of the engagement and the relationship.

Don\u2019t judge just listen.  Leave her there at the lunch, excuse yourself, run back to the jewelry place to collect your ring.  Once it\u2019s back into your possession, end the lunch and go back home.  Drop her at her house if you don\u2019t live together.  End it with I\u2019m going to have to think about this.

You already have the ring back so you don\u2019t have to worry about her keeping the ring or the awkwardness of getting it back.", "NTA - You're not the one that did wrong here. It sounds like she was \"extremely understanding\" because she knew it was her best way \"in\" and that she thought once she was in that meant she's the replacement. I mean you could have a conversation with her and lay down the law and your boundaries, and see if she's willing to abide by them and then make sure she does. But I think that she's probably already destroyed the relationship between her and your son. He's not going to be very forgiving that she had the audacity to come in his room and change things, remove pictures, etc even though she didn't live there yet, nor will he be very forgiving about the things that she said to him.\n\nAnd I just want to tell you good job and kudos for standing up for what's right where your son is concerned, and realizing just because you're getting married that doesn't magically mean your son gets a \"new mother\". There's way to many AITA where parents don't do what is best for the child, so kudos to you for doing what's right by your child.", "NTA but your fianc\u00e9 is......if that is her attitude now then she will make your son's life miserable as the wicked step mother.  \n\n\nIf this was me I would immediately take back the offer of marriage", "The only way that you would be TA is if continue in a relationship with Emi. NTA", "NTA and you are not bad at explaining\u2014I got it perfectly!  Laura will always be your son's mother, and the fact that Emi so boldly tried to force him to give up his photos of her tells you she should not be in your life. Emi is sick with jealousy over a woman who has died, and she will make you and your son miserable if you give her the chance.", "NTA - Emi is, she shouldn't be removing anything from Mj's room at all.  She isn't is mother, he has a mother, she just isn't alive anymore.  \n\nGood for you for standing up for your son and not bowing down to your new fiance, I've read plenty of stories where once dad has a new partner, the deceased mother is erased from the kids lives.", "NTA but I would seriously reconsider marrying her if I were you. That's messed up behavior, MJ has a mom, and that is not her. She, in the best case, would be a step-mom (not with this behavior though). She might be jealous of Laura and this is her way of trying to overcome it. But this is not healthy. Not for her, you and especially not for your son. Of course her relatives would call you an ass. You should probably wipe her off in this case, because she is all in your business and full of sh#t. Even if she had good intentions, they were not towards your son but towards her own insecurities. She needs to grow up and matute a bit before she can marry someone who has a child.", "NTA this is who she is, she will steamroll your son if you give her the chance.", "NTA and if this is how she thinks moms behave, that's also concerning!  This behavior for me would be a dealbreaker for the relationship, but if you decide to move forward with Emi, make sure you sit her down and go over your expectations for how she behaves around your son.

Sorry, but she\u2019s not fit to be around your son. Run far away from her!", "NTA.  How good of her to show you who she truly is _before_ the wedding. \n\nJust think how much worse this situation would have been if she started pulling photos off the wall when you\u2019d gotten home from the honeymoon. \n\nMy man, get that ring back and be glad you dodged that particular bullet.", "Emi went into your son\u2019s room immediately after the two of you were engaged.

Time to put this relationship to rest", "NTA\nyou are doing what is right for your son. She has some nerve doing that to your son. She lucky that is all you did. But yeah I would definitely get the ring back. Sounds like she wanted to be \u201cmommy dearest\u201d or evil step mom whatever she showed you her true self. Sounds like MJ has a great father!", "NTA. Do not marry this woman. She\u2019s jealous of a dead woman and will end up taking it out on your son", "NTA. Protect your kid. Good luck on Saturday getting the ring back", "YTA if you stay with her.", "Sheesh! Get the ring back", "World's shortest engagement.

She\u2019s coming off a little naive. I think you need to have a conversation with her; Laura will always be his mother. Emi will be his stepmother. And that there is room in everyone\u2019s hearts for everyone. I think it\u2019s positive that Emi, feels she is ready to take on the role of a full time mother to a child that isn\u2019t hers, and is into being a family. But she crossed a line removing photos and trying to erase Laura. everyone needs to work on boundaries, communication, understanding and mutual respect, as you build a new blended family. (Especially Emi) I wouldn\u2019t write her off or create more drama or conflict. I think asking your sons therapist for a family therapy referral would be an amazing building block for everyone to work together on building as a family together, even though she\u2019s passed, Laura was a member of this family and will always be missed. (Movie: stepmother with julia roberts has a good scene with the 2 moms talking, and the Nanny, has a great episode where the decreased moms parents come to visit, and learn all the little things Fran incorporated into the kids lives, about their mom) just for visual media references.", "NTA!\n\nThank whoever you pray to that this came out day after proposal instead of day after wedding.

His own damn room) and take away the only pictures he will ever have of his mom.?? Like what kind of person does that? And is that really a person you want to spend the rest of your life with?. I'm sorry but I honestly can't comprehend how she could even a little think this was acceptable and all of her side (friends & family) calling you an ah are morons. You are the only parent your kid has left! Your responsibility is to have him grow up happy & healthy.
