Had one guy get upset because  he tried to command an entire army of werewolves with a bow and arrow  and his Character was a \"Demon teen\" so we were all supposed to just go along with that.  Got a chunk of humble pie real quick.  Learned the difference between  \"We surrender\" and \"I'm suddenly a powerless wuss who cowers before Edward Demon Cullen teen boy and all his body spray.\"", "NTA, and you can quit a campaign for different reasons without being an AH anyways. The GM reacted poorly and behaved like a complete AH.  \n\nBut I would advise not to create linked NPCs (animals or not) resembling people or pets you lost. Because that can lead to very painful experiences, because their fictional version could die in the game, which would suck. \n\nI would do so only in campaigns with my RL friends who I play with for 15 years and know I can trust. We have really intense role-playing sessions for that reason, because we can be all vulnerable around each other and make some really personal games about inner demons, guilt, loss etc.", "NTA. I run a game on sunday afternoons. If a player can't make it, we don't run it unless everyone including the missing person is cool with it, and I certainly wouldn't kill their animal companion without them there, that's insane asshole behavior.", "NTA\n\nListen to Labia-Soup, this person is an example of a good DM.", "Right? I once had a DM tell me I couldn't name my Orc Fighter \"Spike\". I told him to get fucked real fast.\n\nOn the flip side my current DM is so cool. In one of his games I'm playing as a homebrew race based off of the Lummox from Ren & Stimpy.\n\nFor some reason some DMs just get this huge ego and become a control freak. It isn't fun.", "D&D is basically a cooperative story telling game with rules in order to enforce consequences and stuff. \n\nThe DM is basically the narrator and rules keeper. OP's DM is a giant asshole. \n\nI ran in to a few of them in the past where they try and run the game like a prison. It sucks and it isn't fun.\n\nThe DM shouldn't be making any kind of character decisions for players IMO.", "Depends, different kinds have different rules. But true ressurection can revive things decades old. Its also high level and expensive to cast.\n\nEdit: user has a point. I'm petty when it comes to bad DMs.\n\nIf someone has a bag of holding ask them to stuff the dog in there, don't tell the DM. Pretty sure even the core rules state food doesn't decay when in a bag of holding. So the dog shouldn't either.\n\nWhile playing the game, make it a point to find a scroll that can revive your dog and then make your big reveal. \n\nThe DM is likely not to roll with it cause they sound like an asshole, but at that point I'd leave.", "Ooo, don't cut yourself on all of that edge.", "OP, didn't anything wrong. The DM was an asshole, so they excused themselves from the campaign. OP didn't attack or insult them, simply removed themselves from the situation. That was the mature response, despite what you seem to think.", "You're ignoring a lot of things.\n\nFor starters, you forgot the human playing that game. And that the game is supposed to be a fun past time.\n\nThe DM decides to punish the player for leaving early because they didn't feel well by killing their dog, which was based off of a real world one OP just recently lost. \n\nThis isn't like someone losing a game of Mortal Kombat and throwing a fit. What their DM did was completely unreasonable, immature and emotionally cruel. \n\nFinally, one of the most important rules in D&D, that's even written in the Dungeon Master's Guide, is that the DM is not the player's enemy. It isn't a competitive game, its a cooperative experience.\n\nThe fact that you don't understand that says so much.", "Eh, if depends for me. Right now I'm running an evil rogue who managed to get his hands on a town and turned it in to monster town. My DM allows me to attempt to recruit other intelligent monsters and is even designing a system for me to run the town and make decisions. I currently have 3 Kolbolds and 9 Goblins at my disposal. \n\nBut there's a huge difference between a player setting a goal and gradually making their way there VS starting off super OP. \n\nAlthough I've run OP games and they're fun enough in limited doses.", "My favorite part of being a DM is spending hours planning something out, including possible things my players will do and how I could respond, only for them to do some shit I've never considered.\n\nThat's not even sarcasm.

That changes nothing.", "The world is a better place for this to have happened in it.", "NTA, that DM's a fucking asshole. \"you should've been here to argue against me\"? Fuck that guy. \n\nAnd never mind his whining about how it doesn't match your character. As a DM, I actively helped one of my players immortalize her beloved (and sadly departed) pet cat by giving her Fighter a Tressym (winged cat) that coincidentally had the same markings as her lost pet. And that cat was straight up immune from any damage at all, I wasn't going to take away a beloved pet for a SECOND time. \n\nDon't go back. He's being petty and punishing you for getting sick. Take the other players with you and find a new campaign. \n\nI'm sorry about your pup.", "NTA.\n\nThe DM might have considered it slightly unbalancing to allow you something like a Dire Wolf that's not accounted for as a class feature-- like, if a player of mine was just like \"btw I have a Dire Wolf,\" I'd be like \"wat, how are you justifying that\" especially if the party is low-level enough that it would have a significant effect on party balance in combat. \n\nWhat I would *not* do is accept the existence of the Dire Wolf, then change my mind and kill it off-screen in some fit of pique. He may well have been looking for an excuse to get rid of your animal companion, but he chose a *really bad one* and shouldn't be making excuses anyways-- if something that you previously approved is unbalancing, just talk it out with the player and come to a solution instead of acting like an indecisive tyrant. Significant things should never happen to a character when the player isn't there. \n\nOf course, he might have done it JUST to \"punish\" you for being sick. But it's possible that his decision was not just motivated by vengeful pettiness but ALSO by being a shitty DM who can't balance his game properly. Either motivation, of course, makes him an AH.", "NTA. That DM is a jerk and apparently on a power trip. If I were you I\u2019d even consider leaving that group completely.", "As a DM I would never screw around with somebody else\u2019s character sheet like that. Not for any reason, but especially not while acting like a parent taking away a misbehaving child\u2019s toy. \n\nI don\u2019t punish my players for not being able to make it to a session. Life happens and a DnD game is always going to be secondary to that.

The look of shock, heartbreak, and awe/humor on his face when we were in and out sooo fast still stands out to me years later.", "We upset our DM during a session by going completely off the rail. We were a party of 3 Chaotic Neutrals and 1 Chaotic Good. Our DM introduced a rare game to hunt, and most of the caravan that we were protecting went after it.
