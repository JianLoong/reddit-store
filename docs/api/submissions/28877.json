Significant things should never happen to a character when the player isn't there. \n\nOf course, he might have done it JUST to \"punish\" you for being sick.

If you're into video games, the original Final Fantasy games are essentially a very basic TRPG.\n\nBasically, you are cooperatively telling a story; there are rules to keep things on track/make things exciting. The DM or GM, Dungeon Master or Game Master, is the keeper of the rules/referee and narrator; they decide if there's magic or not, what the Overall Goal is, what sort of enemies players encounter when. They make maps for the castles you're gonna enter, look up riddles to solve, and decide that the gate guard can be bribed with homemade soup.\n\nThe players are the main characters, such as a mage who sets a tree on fire to distract the guard instead of getting him soup, the rogue who knows how to pick locks and get them in the back door, and when they discover they entered into the Guard Dog Kennels, the bard who frantically plays soothing music to get them to fall asleep (and gets half to leave them alone). Both sides roll dice to see if the dogs bite them or they dodge.\n\nOP said 'I am playing this game, and my character has a pet, which is based on my real pet that died' and the DM said 'Yes, this is fine for this game, I am okay with characters having pets.' Then OP got sick, and came back, and the DM said 'I killed your character's pet while you were gone. You have no chance to save them.'
