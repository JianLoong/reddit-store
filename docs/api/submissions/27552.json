These days, I have the ability to drop in sometime during the day for a quick \u201chi how\u2019s it going\u201d as well as being able to spend lunches together. I\u2019ve been doing both of these but not very regularly. \n\nI guess May tolerated me before, but now that she is forced to be around me more often, she\u2019s can\u2019t stand me.

I told my GF that I won\u2019t be seeking her any less and that her friend needs to get over herself. Nowadays whenever I speak to my gf in her presence, she will sulk and or dramatically walk away.

May sounds unreasonable and childish. Also, you say she\u2019s a genuinely good friend to your GF, but a truly good friend would make the effort to get to know you and have a good relationship with you if she knew the relationship was serious and her best friend was happy. At the very least, even if she couldn\u2019t stand you, she\u2019d try to be cordial for your GF\u2019s sake.

Why does May hate you so much that it gives her \"body shakes\"/causes her to lose sleep? Do you and May have some type of history? Is it possible May and your girlfriend are more than friends? From my (38f) perspective, something isnt adding up. \n\nWe all have to work/share a class with someone we don't like sometimes. A mature adult doesnt lose sleep over it, unless there is some type of trauma. Futhermore, there are boundries in normal friendships. It's typically not acceptable to treat one's best friend's SO with such disrespect. Unless youre leaving out some very important details, your \"girlfriend\" isnt that into you.\n\nI say this because May's perception of you has likely been shaped by what your girlfriend has told her. If one of my friend's randomly insulted my husband, I would stand up for him. I likely wouldnt share the insult with him, though; because it would only hurt his feelings. However, if I confided in a friend about his misbehavior and it resulted in them disliking him; that would be understandable. You mentioned your GF doesnt want to upset May because they still have another year of school together (after you graduate). It could be the case that youre the one she doesnt want to upset (until you graduate). \n\nI would have a serious conversation with your GF about the future of your relationship, and make sure youre on the same page.", "Nta ask your girlfriend if she\u2019s truly envisioned what your wedding will be like, from the whole process up to the very day of. May will lose it, she\u2019ll keep pushing boundaries and will probably ruin the experience so much so that your marriage will be off to a bad start given that your wedding will be all about May and how sad she is that you\u2019re stealing her best friend in her eyes and how she hates you. \nYour gf needs to set clear boundaries with her and explain that she can\u2019t keep acting this way, you\u2019ll eventually be moving in,married and possibly kids and who knows what, if she\u2019s this unhappy now what about then.\nIs she close enough that she\u2019d be a bridesmaid? I couldn\u2019t imagine knowing someone truly hated me for loving my partner and existing in their life and having to watch them on my wedding day knowing they hate me. What if she objects? Yes a lot of these are what if\u2019s but based on her behaviour, it\u2019s pretty easy to see how that\u2019ll work out in the long run if she\u2019s not told different now", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
