We got into a huge argument where she accused me of not supporting her after she got fired for standing up to a moral wrong. In the heat of the moment she said I\u2019m as bad as her boss because I\u2019m enabling his behavior. For the record I\u2019ve never met him or knows what he looks like.

You can\u2019t just listen to the client.", ">  Some also make it illegal to fire someone who reports illegal activity.\n\nJust for some internet nitpickiness, it's illegal in all states to be fired for reporting illegal activity on the basis of retaliation protection laws and whistleblower protections, as EEOC and whisleblower laws are federal.", "Montana tho. Don\u2019t give legal advice when you don\u2019t even know the state they\u2019re in.", "I think someone who compulsively needs to act upon their moral compass would certainly pay back any loan.

This is essentially what I just commented. I\u2019m glad someone else mentioned that if she was going to do this, do it anonymously. Personally, if someone was cheating on me, I would like to know! But OPs ex sucks and had no reason act the way she did towards him.", "The thing is I don\u2019t necessarily believe OP should give her $5000 because that\u2019s not a laughable chunk of money to most people. However I do think that they aren\u2019t compatible and they both deserve to be with partners who would be better at supporting their values and world views.", "The lesson learned is that life is not fair and if you stick your nose where it doesn't belong you may get hurt. Employers have a huge amount of power and even if they don't fire you they can make your life miserable.\n\nAs I said before, I think cheating is despicable but it's naive to think that justice will always prevail and that cheaters will get their comeuppance.

OP not only should you not lend her the money, she shouldn\u2019t pay this guy. If she has a good case he should go with a contingency fee, he gets paid when/if he wins. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s why employment lawyers turn down a lot of cases.", "That's contingency.  They believe you have a case or at least grounds to force a settlement.  They'll basically work for free (usually short of costs like Fedex) but they take 40% of what comes out of it.  \n\nRetainer is paying them hourly for their work with a fixed amount due upfront and renewed as necessary.  So you'd pay a few thousand, they'd bill against that until it ran out, and won't do more work until you plop down a few more thousand.", "But the opinion and feelings of someone just passing by counts as much as yours. Don\u2019t think because you went to law school, practice law and have an idea of your industry that that makes your knowledge better than that guy\u2019s opinion.", "Agreed, 5K is a very small retainer.", "Let\u2019s do the math.  The attorney charged $300 per hour and demanded a $5,000 retainer.  That retainer covers 16.6 hours of work.", "Cheating on your wife is not illegal.", "This isn\u2019t really true.  Federal whistleblower protection is very limited..", "Even without at-will laws, that just means they would have to provide the reason they fired her, and that it didn't violate their written personnel policy. It's a very easy argument to be made that repeated insubordination, up to and including interfering in a superior's personal life, is bad for the department to constitute good cause.", "OP\u2019s gf could legally be fired in Montana because what she did provided good cause.  But you are correct.  Montana is the sole exception to at will employment in the US.", "The gf strikes me as the type who will act upon their moral compass for a sense of superiority and to look virtuous to others but won\u2019t accept the negative consequences from doing so.", "> anything she is looking for from this point on is almost utterly selfish in nature,\n\nIt was selfish in nature the second she decided to do this face to face with boss's wife instead of anonymously.", "So she should just be OK that she was fired?", "She's the hammer searching endlessly for a naughty nail to smack.", "> However, if OP is overblowing how much of a \u201cfit\u201d that she\u2019s throwing, then I really feel for her.\n\nShe's demanding $5,000 from him for a lawyer, and equivocating himself and her apparent sleaze boss because he's saying no.\n\n>I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for wanting to inform the spouse that she\u2019s being cheated on.\n\nEveryone keeps taking it as gospel that he was cheating, but all OP said was that he was hugging & hand holding with someone else in public. That can be, in many cultures, something done between siblings, parent/child, and friends. There's no indication that wife confirmed an affair existed, or that a possible misunderstanding may have been cleared up after the fact. There's even the possibility that their marriage had entirely broken down beforehand and that they were only staying married for optics, or in the process of separation, and OP's girlfriend breaking this news 'outed' that.", "True, and Gf shouldn\u2019t blame Op for the situation she in. But since the start OP has showed her little to none support, \n\nOP thinks he knows better than a lawyer and is not really bringing foward financial issues or how it would complicate his life if he didn\u2019t get the money back, only that it would be a waste, which makes me think he can afford.", ">hostile work environment\n\nBoss could argue that being stalked by a subordinate and having pictures taken in secret in an attempt to blow up his personal life is a hostile work environment. He can argue that the individual in the photo was a close personal friend, like a sister, and she was attempting to slander him in the workplace. World's easiest counterclaim.\n\nWe *don't even know if the wife cared, or if this was indeed a friend or family member*. There were not overt romantic actions preformed that OP's girlfriend witnessed. Hugs and holding hands are common displays of familial and friendly love.\n\nConsidering HR argued that the dismissal would stand on the grounds of ongoing personality conflicts, combined with OP's assessment that his girlfriend can't stay out of things, I'd wager that there's a file on girlfriend of a few different complaints about her getting involved in other peoples' business.", "I read it just fine, and you can say 'you can support her without providing money' but that flies in face of her directly equivocating OP and her boss because he's 'enabling his behavior'. The only way OP could possibly be enabling boss's behavior is if he's refusing to pay the $5k.", "Of course. Unless it was a similar case you have no idea what are you talking about.

Criminal cases have the smallest percentage of acquittal, meaning they are hard to win compared to a civil case which goes back to unwinable cases(especially when deemed by people who are not professionals) are meaningless. You have no leg to stand when you say there is no case and you just wanna hate on woman", "Is this a right to work state? Because if so,  don't see how she could have a case. This isn't protected whistle blower territory. She called his wife for a non business reason and they've had conflicts before.", "I never said it was.\n\nI pointed out that saying it's illegal in 'some' states to fire someone reporting illegal activity isn't quite accurate, as federal law protects them, so it would be every state.\n\nOP's girlfriend has zero actual legal standing.", "You can be legally fired even if you never violate a written personnel policy.", "Why do you hate her so much?

It just seems as if she can\u2019t comprehend how this situation isn\u2019t as black and white to him as it is for her. Again just seems like an incompatibility problem. \n\nI also don\u2019t blame him though just because you can afford to do something doesn\u2019t mean you have to.\n\nI think she should take her case to another lawyer.

Your hypothetical is completely irrelevant to a hostile work environment claim.", "You're demonstrating that you have no idea what you are talking about.  The OJ case was criminal.  The case the OP is talking about is a tort.  If it's a \"good case\" then PI lawyers would be lining up to take the case on a contingency because that's how they pay their bills.  IANAL, but I know the difference between a criminal and civil case and I know not to argue from a position of ignorance.", "Civil vs criminal is \"semantics.\"  LOL.  Really.  I laughed reading that and then I stopped because there isn't any reason to read more.  Ok, we're done.", "I was never attracted to her.", "Right but the only thing the person who got fired  reported was adultery.", "In Montana, you have to provide a good cause for termination if they're employed for more than a year.

Your boss getting mad at you isn't creating a hostile work environment. A one off conflict between a boss and their employee would not be considered a hostile work environment.\n\nUnless you're protected under contract, your boss can come in the next day and decide he doesn't want blonde people working for him, and fire every blonde person. He can decide he doesn't like the cut of your jib, and fire you. Hell, he can say he likes the cut of your jib *too much* and fire you, so long as it can't be misinterpreted as a come-on. He can decide you step too loudly and fire you, so long as your stepping isn't related to a disability. They can fire you for refusing to go to the strip club with them, so long as you aren't claiming it's against your religion. \n\nAs far as your specious claim that this would qualify as retaliation, can you explain how the DOL classifies 'photographing boss outside of work' as a [protected activity?](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/retaliation)\n\nI'm still waiting on you to point out what lends credence to a wrongful termination claim here.
