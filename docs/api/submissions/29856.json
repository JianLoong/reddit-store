A few months ago, we ran into her boss holding hands and hugging a woman who is not his wife. This annoyed my girlfriend so she took pics of the couple against my advice. She wanted to tell his wife who worked in a different group at the same company. We had a long discussion where I told her to mind her own business and there can be no good outcome for her if she gets involved. I told her to delete the pics and stay out of it.\n\nShe didn\u2019t and eventually told the wife. Things blew up and her boss fired her. She tried going to HR but they told her that he had the right to fire her due to their ongoing personality conflicts. Against my further advice, she saw an attorney and apparently he said they have a good case.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have much savings so wants to borrow $5,000 from me for his retainer fee and his hourly rate is $300. I\u2019ve never dealt with attorneys and lawsuits so I know nothing about the process.

We got into a huge argument where she accused me of not supporting her after she got fired for standing up to a moral wrong. In the heat of the moment she said I\u2019m as bad as her boss because I\u2019m enabling his behavior. For the record I\u2019ve never met him or knows what he looks like.

We had a long discussion where I told her to mind her own business and there can be no good outcome for her if she gets involved. I told her to delete the pics and stay out of it.\n\nShe didn\u2019t and eventually told the wife. Things blew up and her boss fired her. She tried going to HR but they told her that he had the right to fire her due to their ongoing personality conflicts. Against my further advice, she saw an attorney and apparently he said they have a good case.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have much savings so wants to borrow $5,000 from me for his retainer fee and his hourly rate is $300. I\u2019ve never dealt with attorneys and lawsuits so I know nothing about the process. While he said they have a good case, I disagree and thinks she has no case so I don\u2019t want to waste my money on the slim chance she\u2019ll win and even slimmer chance of winning attorney fees.\n\nShe\u2019s been trying to get me to loan her the money and last night I gave her a hard and final no. We got into a huge argument where she accused me of not supporting her after she got fired for standing up to a moral wrong. In the heat of the moment she said I\u2019m as bad as her boss because I\u2019m enabling his behavior. For the record I\u2019ve never met him or knows what he looks like. Had she not point him out, I wouldn\u2019t known.\n\nAnyway, she went home and have not returned any texts or calls today.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But it seems like she really wanted to look like the good guy and get a pat on the back from boss\u2019s wife for being such an amazing person to be the one to personally tell her.", "You\u2019re assuming the motivation is \u201ca sense of moral superiority\u201d rather than compassion. Its hard to seriously consider the rest of what you\u2019re saying when out of the gate you\u2019re projecting such unflattering motives on the situation with no data", "How do you or OP's girlfriend know that her boss is having an affair? For all any of us know including the girlfriend the boss and his wife could have a poly- relationship or open marriage.\n\nIt's not moral high ground to stick your nose into other people's business especially when you don't have all the information.", "Wait, how do we know all that?", "It's easy to say when you don't risk your own money.\n\nThe point is OP doesn't want to take the risk just because his GF can't mind her own business, which is fair. \nShe can pay for it herself or suck it up and pad herself on the shoulder and start looking for a new job.\n\nSo if this is such a sure thing, why not take alone and all the risk for herself?", "As surely as I am typing this out in my Gulfstream G700, with a Salma Hayek lookalike in the seat next to mine and a Haliburton full of kruggerands at my feet!", "I dunno, if someone wants me to lend FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS, I feel entitled to nitpick all I want before I decide to lend it.  If the borrower finds my concerns meritless, get the money from someone else.", "Lawyer would take the case if they were confident it was a win, as they'd be confident they'd make money. Lawyers aren't exactly known for their ethics a lot of the time.\n\nOP doesn't need to know jack about the law to effectively apply common sense here...", "[deleted]", "I did consider it when forming my conclusion but honestly I don't think it matters whether she was being compassionate or not. She did a silly thing she felt she had the right to do because she was morally outraged and she swiftly suffered the more realistic consequences of those actions. Being right doesn't make a blind bit of difference, nor does being compassionate.", "Honestly that\u2019s absolutely a fair point. My whole point was that I can honestly see arguments both for and against sticking your nose in at least a little. Because if my spouse was messing around on me, I\u2019d want to know", "And how do we know that what the GF did was 'morally correct' and 'protecting the real victim'? All we know is that the woman was not the boss's wife. We don't, and nor does the GF, know the specific details of the boss and wife's relationship.", "I mean, OP seems pretty indifferent to the fact his GF got fired because she called out a cheater. He doesn't have to loan her the money at all but he could at least meet with the attorney and ask some questions and take more of an interest in how someone royally fucked over his partner.", "Meh. If you were REALLY a good lawyer, you'd be able to afford the real Salma Hayek \ud83d\ude02", "The problem is OP completely uninterested in it like cant even meet the attorney to hear them out about the claim and chance to win?", "My goodness, your opinion of lawyers is MUCH more generous than mine, and I have been one since the Clinton administration.", "What?", "Morally outraged - you literally cannot describe your view without projecting unflattering intentions on her.\n\nIt is possible she was solely motivated by selfless compassion for someone she works with", "Informing the wife cannot possibly do harm and has a high chance to be good", "Well, her not minding her own business is apparently something she does often.\n\n\nBut I get the idea you real really want to pin something on OP.\n\nFist it was \"he can give the money cause he doesn't know anything and he will get it back\" \n\nNow it's \"but...but op is also not supportive or showing interest now the gf faves the consequences of her actions\".", "My colleagues would say I'm a tolerably good attorney, but IIRC, Ms. Salma is married to a billionaire, so I would need to be the ten best lawyers in history all rolled into one.", "Sorry, I just can't follow you there.  GF first demonstrates horrendous practical judgment by sticking her nose in, and then somehow finds the only plaintiff-side employment lawyer I have ever heard of who takes a case on an hourly basis rather than contingency.  Under these circumstances, like OP, I would not need to meet with the lawyer to make my decision about not lending the money.", "I mean, I don't know where OP is from, but from just a cursory knowledge of labor laws gained from working for the past 25 years, I can't imagine what case OPs GF would have. Getting fired for contacting your boss's wife to tell her you think he's cheating on her, and oh btw here's some creep shots I took of him for which I have *no context* is definitely fire worthy behavior. People get fired for way less. No discrimination laws were broken. She created a hostile work environment with her behavior so you can't say she was wrongfully terminated. And whether it was true or not (boss could have been hugging a family member??) it had no bearing on the business so she doesn't get any whistleblower protections.  You don't need a degree to just logic this one out.", "oh sorry, misread the thread. Appreciate the example of the medical diagnosis to help illustrate it.", "I wouldn't call morally outraged a particularly loded term in this case. Although I can see what you mean I think that the reason she feels any kind of way at all here is because what he is doing literally outrages her morals, it transgresses the bounds of what she believes her colleague should be subject to without her knowledge. So out of compassion, she lets her know. If moral outrage is a negative for you in this case I think you had best examine why you think that rather than why you think I'm saying it.", "Now, I agree with that. But from what we know, 'things blew up and her boss fired her.' With us once again not knowing anything about the specific details, my point still stands, which is that you can't claim with certainty that she did the 'morally correct' thing and 'protecting the real victim'. And as other people have pointed out in this comment section, HR's statements about 'ongoing personality conflicts' does have implications that this heavy-handed black-and-white morality may have created issues before. OP was right from the get-go, she should have minded her own business. Instead, she decided that her boss was cheating, she was right, and therefore she had the right to start drama, damn the consequences.", "Why the hell didn't she send it anonymously to the wife? That's just poor judgement.", "Yeah you\u2019re right, I\u2019m just as bad as everyone else here projecting assumptions on the situation. I think my bias when I see someone getting shat upon unjustly is to defend them in equal measure, but on AITA that isnt right either", "Because she imagined a world in which she was praised by wife and boss was shunned, and she got to bask in the limelight of it all.", "Hah, you're right."]}
