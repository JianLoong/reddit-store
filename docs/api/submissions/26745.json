My parents joked about him being colorblind since my uncle (my dad\u2019s brother) is. He continued this claim, constantly mentioning it to others, which has always annoyed me because I\u2019m sure he\u2019s lying. I\u2019ve told my parents, but they brush me off, saying I\u2019m just jealous of the attention he gets.\n\nLast week was my birthday. I had a gathering at home with about 25-30 people on the weekend. The topic of his supposed colorblindness came up again, with everyone asking him to identify colors. I, feeling frustrated, asked him to take an Ishihara test on the TV. He agreed after some hesitation. I went up to my room to grab my computer to plug to the TV. But instead of a genuine test, I used a fake Ishihara test, one that anyone could pass. He pretended not to see some numbers, and once the test concluded, I revealed to everyone that it was a fake test, aiming to show he was lying.\n\nThe mood turned sour. My brother and parents were furious. My family tried to brush it off, making jokes, and my friends found it amusing. Post-party, my parents were livid, they labeled me as an \u201cattention seeker\u201d and a jealous asshole and grounded me for embarrassing my brother.\n\nI feel like had he been honest, he wouldn\u2019t have been humiliated.

One T-shirt color misidentification does not a color  blind person make. For example, I have a really hard time telling red and dark orange apart. However, I am not colorblind.

He\u2019s likely at the point where it\u2019s to late for him to back down now.\n\n*edit, some commenters have indicated some people are diagnosed later in life. I went down a research rabbit hole and it really is a fascinating the different types of color blindness there are. However, as we have all basically said your brother is faking.", "Ehhhhh NTA. Liars deserve to be called out and you didn\u2019t embarrass him, he did that to himself.", "NTA\n\nYour brother's long con got exposed and your parents appeared stupid in front of the family for going along/falling for his lies which is why they are angry.

Pathological lying, narcissism.  Generally the reason people develop these ego disorders is to obfuscate their own insecurity or an inferiority complex.\n\nI would follow up with your brother and apologize for the manner in which you did this but explain why it\u2019s important that he understands that lying has real life consequence.  That most people, like everyone in the room with you that day, see right through his lies but humor him to avoid conflict.  \n\nDoes he honestly want to be humored his whole life?  Deluding himself that other people buy his lies?  Cause they don\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019d also seriously talk to your parents about therapy for him and to specifically cover the lying.", "NTA.  sounds like he wore a pink shirt and regretted it or felt embarrassed so claimed his was color blind.  Then it all got out of control.  He is playing the long con for sure.  Doesn't seem worth the effort.", ">My parents joked about him being colorblind since my uncle (my dad\u2019s brother) is.\n\nYour brother hasn't been paying attention in Biology class, has he? The most common type of colorblindness (red-green) is X-linked, so he would have to inherit it from your mother's side of the family (specifically your mother's male relatives need to be color blind). The other type of inherited colorblindness (blue-yellow) is a dominant trait, so one of your parents needs to be colorblind as well.\n\nBut to give a judgement, ESH. Yes, your brother is an annoying liar, but he wasn't hurting anyone with it. Tricking him into revealing his benign lie is just mean and unhelpful. Eventually his lie would have been exposed and you wouldn't have been responsible. Now you've lost the moral high ground.", "That\u2019s very funny and I get why you did it, but ESH. I\u2019m not saying that because of any embarrassment you may have caused him or anything, but because this is just going to cause more problems, especially for you. I don\u2019t know how your parents and brother are, but I imagine this will take some time to blow over and it\u2019s going to be tense times in the house until it does. \n\nThat being said, I get that it\u2019s infuriating to be damn sure someone is lying about something and not being able to pin the lie down. Unfortunately managing to expose them often just isn\u2019t a winning move. As you experienced, often people close to the liar will turn around and defend them instead of facing the truth. \n\nI really hate using this argument since I feel that sometimes it is important to stand up to dishonesty even if it doesn\u2019t affect you, but him lying wasn\u2019t doing damage aside from the dishonesty itself. It\u2019s super gross to lie about any disability, but from what you said, it doesn\u2019t look like he was taking any services or trying to insinuate himself as a spokesperson for colorblind people. If he was doing something like that, then bringing your suspicions to everyone would have been more than justified. If he continued this ruse, or still continues it even after being exposed, eventually he\u2019s going to say or do something around someone where he\u2019ll be called out and it may or may not stick then.\nIt sucks. Your brother is an asshole. Not the biggest one right now, but if he doesn\u2019t realize that lying about stuff like this is shitty he likely will spin bigger yarns and maybe get into bigger trouble, but that\u2019s on him. \n\nYour heart was in the right place and I totally get why you did what you did, but unfortunately you\u2019re not going to win this one. This is sort of a halfhearted ESH since I think he\u2019s way worse than you, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite an asshole here, but I do think you made a rash move that isn\u2019t going to pay off and there\u2019s not really a code for that. You\u2019re young and making mistakes is part of growing up and all things considered this isn\u2019t a huge one, but I hope you can resolve things with your family. It sucks to ignore shit like this, but there\u2019s just not a lot to be done and if you do decide to do something, it\u2019s important to understand the repercussions and be sure you\u2019re fine with them before you try.", "YTA.
