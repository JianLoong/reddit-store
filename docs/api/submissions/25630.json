I was one of the two drivers and I would pick up some friends, including our transgender friend Lisa. Lisa came out to us as transgender in May but she had know for longer (and we secretly suspected as much already) and had already come out to her parents and therapist in December/January. We opened her with open arms and quickly came out to the general public as well and started dressing feminine as well, skirts, dresses, cute strawberry leggings etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSkip forward to last Friday when I went to her house pick her up to go to the zoo. She was wearing high heeled boots(Edit for clarification: The boots had block heel, not pin/stiletto heels). I had never seen these boots and never saw her wear something heeled before, so I asked about it and she said it was indeed a new pair and her first heeled footwear. I told her to bring some comfortable sneakers with her just in case since I didn't think she would be able to walk on those the whole day since they are new and heeled which isn't the most comfortable combination and we would probable at the zoo from open to close (8 hours). She told me she was fine and didn't bring comfy shoes with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter 3 hours of walking through the zoo, her feet started to hurt and she was taking break after break to rest her feet. I quickly became annoying because at this rate we wouldn't be able to see the whole zoo. After another 20 minutes of this I said I would go ahead alone and because I wanted to see the feeding of the apes and I wasn't going to miss it because she didn't want to listen to my advice. I left alone but quickly was joined by the rest of my friends except Lisa. They told her they would come back after the feeding and that she could use the time to rest her feet for longer and take her boots of for a bit. When we came back after the feeding, Lisa wasn't were we left her. We called her to ask where she was and she told us she was on the bus back home since we abandoned her. We ended up seeing the rest of the zoo and staying till it closed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow we're getting angry text and calls from her, her parents and some common friends saying that we're bad friends, jerks etc and her mother even called us transphobic because heeled boots were the next step to her full femininity and denying her that was equal to being anti-trans.\n\nSo now I'm wondering if I was being to harsh and if I'm truly the a-hole", "created_utc": 1693144012, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162qv6k/aita_for_leaving_my_trans_friend_behind_in_the/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You warned your friend and she ignored the sensible warning. She then expected everyone to spend time catering to her bad decision. \n\nHer and her parents reactions are over the top. You are not transphobic, at all, and to suggest you are diminishes the word, it is a lazy accusation to cover for the fact your friend made a bad choice.", "NTA.  Trans or nor, anyone wearing high heels for the first time at a zoo or any place where there's a lot of walking deserves what they get.", "NTA, but this has nothing to do with being trans. We've all had \"that friend\" that wears stilettos to the grocery store or platform sandals on cobblestone. Or,  better yet,  the functional equivalent of a bikini to a club in the winter, then complains when you're trying to remember where you parked your car. \n\nThis has everything to do with dressing appropriately to the circumstance.  Try kitten heels or fun sandals. Your friend didn't consider the impact of her choices on the group. You can be an AH regardless of race, religion, gender, and sexual preference. Being trans does not give you special friend accommodation when you fail to apply common sense.", "Her parents are texting you? Come onnnnnnn", "Pulling the transphobe card on a good friend over footwear. They really have no floor for despicable behavior", "NTA.  Heels are uncomfortable and not meant for walking around in all day long, everyone knows that.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t believe her transgender to be a relevant point in the story either. Yes, it was her first time wearing them but even someone who had been wearing them for years and years would struggle walking around a zoo all day in them. \n\nYou gave well intentioned advice and she ignored it. Its her fault she missed out and makes her an AH to expect you to wait with her. A nice, self aware person would admit they were wrong and insist you went ahead without them.", "NTA. No one should wear a new pair of shoes when you know you will be doing a lot of walking. Male or female or trans.", "NTA. Maybe next time she'll consider your well intentioned advice. Sounds like a learning experience to not wear heels to the zoo. I'd even say NAH because she didnt know how uncomfortable it would be, and you just wanted to have fun. The only A's are those making it a transphobia issue when it isn't.", "I am transgender.  Honestly, you guys seem like good friends to her, in general.  The thing to remember is that we didn\u2019t get the girl to woman teenage years to make all the mistakes children do, we have few female relatives to learn off as we grow up.  We have to rapidly go through that, normally at a later age, often alone and without much support, often in hiding, with clouds of shame and fears of abuse.  She\u2019s gonna make a lot of mistakes.  That\u2019s when she especially needs a little extra love and support.  Is it annoying, sure, can you cope with that?  Your call.  I think she made a huge mistake not bringing comfy shoes to a walk all day event. She\u2019ll learn, I hope.  Reach out to her.  If her mother calls you transphobic for that she\u2019s an idiot.  You got impatient, you did abandon her, but she did kind of deserve it.  No one\u2019s particularly at fault here.  But try and be patient helping her through these mishaps.  NTA.", "Nta", "NTA she\u2019s not the first or last woman to make dumb shoe choices for an activity. I\u2019m sure she was embarrassed and felt abandoned, but she wasn\u2019t in any danger and next time she\u2019ll know to wear runners to the zoo.", "NTA\n\nTheir choice to wear improper footwear is the issue. Not gender identity or the groups \"transphobia\". Her parents are ridiculous. Your group as a whole should not lose out on a planned day out because one person choose to wear footwear unbecoming of the outing.", "I mean I don't know why you would be called transphobic on this as the issue has nothing to do with being trans or gender in general.\n\nIt's like if I bought flip flops to the ski and complain about my feet being cold after two hours... NTA", "NTA\n  Seems like she\u2019s the one who abandoned ya\u2019ll.", "NTA. This has nothing to do with transphobia and everything to do with the fact that she did not wear shoes that were appropriate for the outing. Had she listened and brought extra shoes, this would not have been an issue. I also don't consider it abandoning someone when there has been a conversation. She wanted to rest her feet, and was told that you all would be back shortly.", "NTA - Just because she is trans does not mean she is the only person who exists in the world. You all wanted to enjoy the zoo and she made the whole thing about herself and ridiculously linked it to her sense of femininity. Smart women wear runners to places that require a lot of walking and I guess she\u2019s learned that now. Wearing high heels doesn\u2019t make her any more of a woman, she would still be a woman in runners, just not in pain. I understand that she is at the start of her journey, but she can\u2019t just throw tantrums and when it doesn\u2019t go her way, start playing the trans card.", "NTA she wore the wrong shoes", "NTA", "Nta, has nothing to do with being transfobic...it's common sense", "NTA\n\nIf your friend equates being feminine with making stupid footwear choices, then your friend needs some better role models. You were going to the zoo. You were going to be walking continuously all day. You all knew this, but one of you chose to wear footwear that she couldn't walk in all day, because she thought she looked cute in them. She brought this on herself.\n\nShe's free to wear boots with heels, but her choices are then to either tough it out and deal with the pain, or accept that she's going to miss out on some things because of the choices she made.", "NTA\n\nNot sure why being trans matters though.", "NTA, even if the new boots didn't have heels she would still have been uncomfortable after a while. New shoes are great for shorter trips but not for a whole day at the zoo with so much walking involved. \n\nYou could offer to plan a shorter outing so your friend can show off her new boots.", "I imagine that Lisa, who just very recently came out and is starting to express herself more through what she wears, might've been really excited about her very first pair of high heels, and likely had no clue what it would actually feel like to walk around in brand new heels for 8 hours. It sounds like you supported her in her excitement to wear the new heels, and at the same time provided the sound advice of bringing some comfortable back-up shoes \u2013 something a lot us have learned through a couple of painful experiences. This is her time to learn and experience things that are new to her, even if they aren't new to you. Sure, it would've been wise of her to take your advice, and in hindsight, I'm sure she really regrets not doing so. I'm wondering if Lisa perhaps lashed out because she felt insecure about her \"mistake\"? That doesn't make it okay, of course. Her angry reaction sounds completely uncalled for, and not fair to you. Maybe she, back at the zoo, felt like she could have used some support and reassuarrance? Still, I understand that you wanted to make the most of your day at the zoo, and her poor choice of footwear got in the way of that. I get feeling annoyed at that, and thinking that it could have been easily avoided if she just took your advice. She tried something new, and probably learned that heels can be way more painful than you would imagine. If you want any advice on top of my judgement, I would advise you to put yourself in her shoes (sorry) and show her kindness and support when you reach out. Hopefully, she will also see your perspective on it all, and that her mistake wasn't her unfortunate footwear, but lashing out in anger.\n\n\nBy the way, I know that I'm making a whole bunch of assumptions here \u2013 I'm just trying to imagine what it might have felt like for Lisa, because I do find it relevant here. If I'm wrong about anything, please feel free to let me know.\n\n\nNAH.", "> (4 M, 2F & MTF 23-25)\n\nWait, you're friends with a 2&4 year olds?\n\n\n\nI would say something as a trans woman. If you're wat to feminity is to make yourself uncomfortable, unable to walk more then a few feet and quickly exshusted, you're doing it wrong. Being trans is about knowing which gender you are, and then just being that gender. Sure, she can dress as feminine as she want to a party, but bringing unfitted heels to a zoo is just stupid. Trans or not, you should dress in a way that will allow you to function. You aren't proving to anyone anything if you can't walk in those fancy heels. Nobody will think of you less if you walk around in cute sneakers. NTA", "YTA along with all the other transphobes in these comments.  She had the courage to come out in this way and you punished her for her appearance.  Also are you 8 years old?  Is it really so important to see EVERY SINGLE exhibit?  I hope she finds better friends who know and care to actually support a woman.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did no one have an extra pair of shoes in their car or bag?\n\nShe\u2019s definitely TA for blowing up your phones and calling you transphobic. I can\u2019t decide whether your group are AHs or not. Your friend made a mistake. Yes you saw it coming. But you know what we do when our friends make stupid mistakes? HELP them! Not say I told you so and leave them alone. If she refused help even at the zoo then N T A, though.", "NTA. You gave good suggestions (bring comfy shoes!). These were her first experience with heeled footwear. Veterans of wearing heels know how even the best fitting pair can hurt after a time of walking. You tried to warn her and she refused to listen.

You and your other friends did nothing wrong.", "NTA but what zoo takes 8 hours?", "NTA\n\nMy friends (and husband) would have done the same thing if I'd worn heels and was holding everyone up. If I'd been her friend I would have said \"your heels are adorable but you're going to really hurt yourself, how about you show them off at X later date?\" Or something. I think exploring femininity is important, but fuccck I've had blisters bad from uncomfortable shoes and had to walk home barefoot when a heel broke in cobblestone before \ud83e\udd23 making bad footwear decisions has no gender.", "NTA.  You left her for what... 20 minutes? That's not abandoning her, you even said you were coming back. She left the zoo, not you.", "NTA. I don\u2019t see what your friend being trans has to do with anything. They made a poor choice and caused everyone else issues. Then god mad when everyone was willing to accommodate their poor choices.

A brand new pair of shoes always has some break in for your feet. A dinner or movie or small walking trips acceptable.\n\nAnd I am probably the only one of 2 in my office that still wear heels post pandemic.

If the boot fits...", "I get that everyone makes mistakes but I was mostly annoyed that I warned her this might happen and she should bring comfy shoes just in case but she didn't. I'm also direct and straight forward and this really feels to me like: Warned you against a potential -> didn't heed my warning -> problem happens -> I warned you so it's your problem not mine.

Maybe she and her parents could take more responsibility for that, and offer OP an apology.", "Bc the mom called them transphobic", "Having spoken to some transwomen, an ugly or masculine-leaning pair of shoes can make them feel ugly or masculine, and that's not a fun thing they've probably been dealing with their whole lives. Once you make a decision to transition and express the femininity in clothing choices, it can be emotionally difficult to go back to something more practical.  \n\nI'm a straight woman who likes comfy shoes, and have been called names for it. \n\nTranswomen's femininity gets policed by everyone, and they are something like 8 times more likely to be physically attacked than cis men or women, especially if they don't \"pass\".\n\nI can sypmpathise with OP's friend to some extent, but she's done a stupid embarrassing thing and then blamed her friends for it and hobbled away rather than taking sensible advice and enjoying a good day out.\n\nBut yeah, the trans bit probably does matter quite a lot here. Had she been brought up in a girlier way, she would have had the experience to know that they were not the right choice of shoes, as OP did. She would have had something more in her style as an alternative, and likely wouldn't have been as excited about wearing heels.\n\nThe parents wading in and suggesting OP is transphobic need that pushing back on them. They should have helped her earlier if they are going to go down that road, they should have been open to her wearing heels earlier. That way she might have had the upbringing that more closely correlated with her gender identity.\n\nParents should STFU, and friend needs to be deeply apologetic.", "The friend group exists of 4 males, 3 females and one MTF.

Block heels or wedges that are 2-5 inches I can walk on all day. Anything outside of that? Two hours tops before I swap them out. But that\u2019s because I wear block heels to work, women who wear stilettos or pumps to work and stand up all day are capable of it, hell I know one woman who won\u2019t wear anything but heels bc she\u2019s so used to them! But for your first like three months of that kind of heel? Nah, no shot at those being walking shoes.", "I told you so has never once improved a relationship or helped someone other than helping the speaker feel justified or smug.

That said, it seems that you genuinely like this girl, so it might be helpful to understand: she missed a lot of typical-girl-experiences. She might have really be oblivious about what havoc can a pair of new high heels make on your feet. Walking in the sport shoes won't prepare you for this.\n\n\nIt's perfectly ok to split at the zoo, but maybe stop with this \"I told you so\" attitude and show some compassion.", "Yeah, I told you so only goes so far in life.

Butterfly garden, aviary, an area where you can walk between the monkeys, areas where you can cuddle with certain animals, feeding shows with lots of information on the different animals. There are also little sign with questions and answers about every animal so we were looking for those as well and had a little contest to see who knew the most. We also like observing the behavior of animals. You can easily spent 15 minutes looking and listening to the flamingos because they're just really goofy or follow the red panda while he makes his round around the enclosure. It's also been awarded the most beautiful zoo of the country several years now so it's also just amazing to stroll through all the plants and flowers and decorations. It's a zoo where you also go for the zoo itself and not just the animals in it if that makes sense", "That sounds like a really cute outing with friends :) I hope you get to go there again and have the good day you hoped this one would have been.
