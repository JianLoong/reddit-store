Yes, it was her first time wearing them but even someone who had been wearing them for years and years would struggle walking around a zoo all day in them. \n\nYou gave well intentioned advice and she ignored it.

The thing to remember is that we didn\u2019t get the girl to woman teenage years to make all the mistakes children do, we have few female relatives to learn off as we grow up.  We have to rapidly go through that, normally at a later age, often alone and without much support, often in hiding, with clouds of shame and fears of abuse.  She\u2019s gonna make a lot of mistakes.  That\u2019s when she especially needs a little extra love and support.  Is it annoying, sure, can you cope with that?  Your call.  I think she made a huge mistake not bringing comfy shoes to a walk all day event. She\u2019ll learn, I hope.  Reach out to her.  If her mother calls you transphobic for that she\u2019s an idiot.

You all wanted to enjoy the zoo and she made the whole thing about herself and ridiculously linked it to her sense of femininity. Smart women wear runners to places that require a lot of walking and I guess she\u2019s learned that now. Wearing high heels doesn\u2019t make her any more of a woman, she would still be a woman in runners, just not in pain. I understand that she is at the start of her journey, but she can\u2019t just throw tantrums and when it doesn\u2019t go her way, start playing the trans card.", "NTA she wore the wrong shoes", "NTA", "Nta, has nothing to do with being transfobic...it's common sense", "NTA\n\nIf your friend equates being feminine with making stupid footwear choices, then your friend needs some better role models.

It sounds like you supported her in her excitement to wear the new heels, and at the same time provided the sound advice of bringing some comfortable back-up shoes \u2013 something a lot us have learned through a couple of painful experiences. This is her time to learn and experience things that are new to her, even if they aren't new to you. Sure, it would've been wise of her to take your advice, and in hindsight, I'm sure she really regrets not doing so. I'm wondering if Lisa perhaps lashed out because she felt insecure about her \"mistake\"? That doesn't make it okay, of course. Her angry reaction sounds completely uncalled for, and not fair to you. Maybe she, back at the zoo, felt like she could have used some support and reassuarrance? Still, I understand that you wanted to make the most of your day at the zoo, and her poor choice of footwear got in the way of that. I get feeling annoyed at that, and thinking that it could have been easily avoided if she just took your advice. She tried something new, and probably learned that heels can be way more painful than you would imagine. If you want any advice on top of my judgement, I would advise you to put yourself in her shoes (sorry) and show her kindness and support when you reach out. Hopefully, she will also see your perspective on it all, and that her mistake wasn't her unfortunate footwear, but lashing out in anger.\n\n\nBy the way, I know that I'm making a whole bunch of assumptions here \u2013 I'm just trying to imagine what it might have felt like for Lisa, because I do find it relevant here.

If you're wat to feminity is to make yourself uncomfortable, unable to walk more then a few feet and quickly exshusted, you're doing it wrong. Being trans is about knowing which gender you are, and then just being that gender. Sure, she can dress as feminine as she want to a party, but bringing unfitted heels to a zoo is just stupid. Trans or not, you should dress in a way that will allow you to function. You aren't proving to anyone anything if you can't walk in those fancy heels. Nobody will think of you less if you walk around in cute sneakers. NTA", "YTA along with all the other transphobes in these comments.  She had the courage to come out in this way and you punished her for her appearance.  Also are you 8 years old?  Is it really so important to see EVERY SINGLE exhibit?

And I don't think her feeling the consequences of that mistake in the form and pain and her friends' annoyance means that y'all are assholes.", "NTA - most girls will not wear heels to the zoo, it\u2019s not appropriate footwear regardless of age, sex or anything like else.\n\nI love the episode of Modern Family where Gloria wears heels despite Jay saying she needed to wear flats", "NTA but I don\u2019t see how her being trans has anything to do with this story and it\u2019s kinda weird how much you elaborated on that.", "NTA\nIf your friend is short, this may be the moment when they realize that while they love that heels add to their height and their look, they are not practical to wear. I\u2019ve had two women like this in my life, both we about 5 feet, and both wore heels to place that require significant walking, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen either one of them wear heels since then, and it\u2019s easily been over a decade for both of them.", ">transphobic because heeled boots were the next step to her full femininity\n\nLaughable, since high heels were invented by men to make women more pleasing to their eyes. \"Full femininity\" my ass. More like full misogyny.\n\nNTA. You warned her, you gave her options, and she ignored you, someone who has had extensive personal experience with heels.", "NTA \n\nNothing to do with Trans and again, they victimized themselves. High heels for the first time on a day-long trip to a zoo? Sounds like quite the fool.", "I've seen many trans people over compensate once they come out and this isn't a criticism of her and I understand why, but basically heels are seen as super feminine and being able to go out as YOU when you haven't been able to prior is huge. You're NTA but do send a message saying, \"I honestly suggested different shoes because of the thing we were doing. I love her and I am happy she was there, but heels are never going to be fun at a zoo.\" or something similar. Then disengage. She needs time to realise your advice and then actions afterwards were merely practicality and not anything to do with who she is.", "NTA.   She ignored your advice, only had herself to blame.", "NTA. Lmao, I'm transfeminine myself and have been in precisely her situation before. I'm sorry she takes it badly, but to your credit this did help teach her why cis women also hate heels. I have a good set of heeled boots when I want to wear heels and still walk for a while. Stilettos are not appropriate for this kind of expedition.", "NTA - This wasn't transphobic, this was advice from one woman to another.\n\nI think any of us who have attempted to wear heels for any length of time would extend this same kindness to any other woman. Always take flats if you have to walk anywhere.\n\nBy the same token how do I know this? Because I totally made this mistake myself, not to a zoo but to an occasion where I had to stand up for longer than three and a half minutes.\n\nFlats for walking, heels for looking fab. Unless you're one of those ladies who wears heels to a conference for 12 hours a day in which case, I admire you and your strength. I do not know how you do that.", "NTA. You told Lisa to bring a back-up pair of shoes and she didn\u2019t take your advice.", "NTA, maybe your friend will listen to you next time.", "NTA", "NTA I used to work  day long events (12+ hours some days), and the best advice I ever got was to bring an extra pair of comfy shoes to switch out when the others got uncomfortable. Made the day much more bearable.", "It's slightly relevant in that she's still learning things like life with new heels. It doesn't change the overall verdict, but it softens it.", "I think the relevant part is that maybe Lisa hadn't encountered how uncomfortable wearing new high heeled footwear is when you're not used to it. I wear much lower heels nowadays than I did a decade ago, and if I ever dress up and dig out the old heels there's a lot of \"ow ow my feet\" happening. But generally I *know* this will happen, so I either bring spare shoes or I only wear them somewhere there's a lot of chances to sit down. Lisa hasn't had this kind of experience previously as she grew up wearing male footwear", "This. I find it incredibly had to believe that in Lisas 20+ years of life shes never had to break in a single pair of shoes. I mean, I took a short walk in some new shoes not too long ago and got a nice sized blister on each heel. Let alone walking around a zoo all day.", "As a woman, this is a canon event and you cannot interfere lol. This is something so many folks go through with their first pair of heels - a mistake we don\u2019t quickly make again.", "Saying \u201cwe don\u2019t want to miss [xyz], wait here and rest , we\u2019ll be back when it\u2019s done\u201d and then following through is not \u201cabandoning\u201d anybody. Girlie needs to get a grip.", "I think it is really unfair that OP was labelled transphobic, these things can lead to rumours and then lost jobs, friendships etc. because no-one, including businesses want to be associated with anti-trans (which is good!)", "but here's my problem regardless that still is an adult and needs to act accordingly OP and friends gave her plenty of grace and i'm sorry to say this but being trasgendered is not an excuse to be an AH to your friends who treated with kindness and respect", "OP is definitely NTA. Just wanted to drop that here coz this comment was so well said!", "They have ~130 different animal species. Butterfly garden, aviary, an area where you can walk between the monkeys, areas where you can cuddle with certain animals, feeding shows with lots of information on the different animals. There are also little sign with questions and answers about every animal so we were looking for those as well and had a little contest to see who knew the most. We also like observing the behavior of animals. You can easily spent 15 minutes looking and listening to the flamingos because they're just really goofy or follow the red panda while he makes his round around the enclosure. It's also been awarded the most beautiful zoo of the country several years now so it's also just amazing to stroll through all the plants and flowers and decorations. It's a zoo where you also go for the zoo itself and not just the animals in it if that makes sense\n\n\u261d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThis was OP\u2019s answer to that question in another thread", "It was a trip to the zoo and Lisa decided to wear stupid shoes despite being warned not to - that's on Lisa. And the fact their parents think being a women has to do with high heels- like being a woman is a costume to put on is pathetic and delusional", "the overwhelming majority of women wear sensible shoes to places like the zoo & own their mistakes when they make them instead of getting mad at their friends who tried to warn them and didn\u2019t want to have to keep stopping", "There likely wasn't any shoes at the gift shop-they sell other clothing items, like shirts and hats and jewelry, but I've never seen shoes of any kind in a gift shop at a zoo. Doesn't mean there for sure wasn't, but I think it's safe to assume it was unlikely. Edit: also, the odds of someone having extra shoes is probably low, too. I don't know many ppl who regularly keep a spare pair in their car, and most ppl aren't going to bring an extra if they're just going to be doing one thing all day that doesn't require different footware. \n\nThe friends also weren't planning on leaving Lisa there the whole rest of the day-they were planning on coming back once the event was done. Which is fair. If the gorilla feeding happened at a certain time, they shouldn't be forced to miss it bc Lisa wasn't prepared. It's reasonable to leave her on a bench to rest for the rest of the trip while they go do this one thing.", "Who do you think?", "Still stupid to wear heels to the zoo, though.", "The Bronx Zoo? The San Diego Zoo? \n\nOr, really, *any* zoo if you intend to spend a good amount of time at each exhibit.", "If you wanted to see the entire Omaha zoo, it is a full 6-8 hour day. And some  of the walking is hilly.", "I think there is a possibility you're being transphobic, but I would rather not make assumptions, so I asked for clarification.", "Oh definitely", "I am just saying that the zoos I*'ve been to didn't require 8 hours. It doesn't mean I rushed through them. I took a ton of pictures at each exhibit. I admit I haven't been to the zoos you mentioned.*", "OK, good to know.", "Mmm. What I think you said is that no person can ever spend 8 hours at a zoo and, by implication, you think that's a bit ridiculous.\n\nPersonally, I can spend half an hour or more at one *exhibit*. We're obviously different people, but unless the zoo or museum I'm visiting is very small I could certainly spend eight hours there, if we're counting in a lunch break."]}
