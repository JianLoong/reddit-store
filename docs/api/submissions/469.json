We know living together is harder than just dating so we sat down and agreed to several things. Like we\u2019re responsible for our own laundry. We also split chores on a rotation like I\u2019ll clean the bathroom one week and she\u2019ll clean it the next week. We agreed if one person cooks or buys the food, the other person washes the dishes. We also agreed if we have friends over, the person who cooks doesn\u2019t do the dishes rule applies. This is because we don\u2019t have huge parties, our  apartment is small, and invite over only a few friends so there\u2019s not a ton of dishes. Anyway, I like to cook and is better at it so it just works out that I cook more often. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she cooks too but much less. \n\nSo this weekend we had her best friend and her boyfriend over and I cooked the dinner. We ate and had a good time. Once dinner was done, I brought my plates and stuff to the sink then returned to my seat. We were talking and having a good time then Jen got up and told the group she wants to do the dishes before we head out. Her best friend asked why I didn\u2019t help and I answered because it\u2019s her job. I didn\u2019t think anything of it and we eventually went out.\n\nJen was acting off all week and when I ask her what\u2019s wrong, she answers she\u2019s not feeling well. Today she came home and said we need to talk. She tells me that she doesn\u2019t want to do the dishes anymore and that my answer to her friend sucked. I almost didn\u2019t know what she was talking about because I didn\u2019t realized that I did anything wrong. Then I remembered the dinner and told her that what I said was true, it was my job to cook and hers to wash. She said I could have worded it differently.\n\nSo now she refuses to wash the dishes. I said that\u2019s fine, she can cook and I\u2019ll wash the dishes and she can post it all over her social and tell her friends it\u2019s my job to wash dishes, I don\u2019t have a problem with that. She didn\u2019t like that answer either and stormed off to bed. This morning I made breakfast for both of us. She ate without saying anything then left her dirty dishes in the sink then went out. I guess she\u2019s serious about not washing the dishes again.", "created_utc": 1667072001, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygsjvc/aita_for_making_my_gf_mad_because_i_said_its_her/", "score": 2389, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would try talking to her again and see if she's ready to have an adult conversation and act like one.\n\nI wouldn't cook for her anymore. She can do it all herself. You're not her Mom or her maid. She can buy paper products and tv dinners then.\n\nNot sure why the hell you would move in with 20 year old. YES those 4 years can make a huge difference with mentality at that young age.

Out of the 4 of us, only 2 of us were actually good cooks, so it worked out that we always cooked and the other 2 were always meant to do dishes. About halfway through, the 2 doing dishes started saying how unfair it was that they always did them and we never did. After much back and forth, we just stopped cooking for them, and they always had order in.", "NTA\n\nThe way you worded it could have been better, maybe apologize for that, but\u2026 she also owes you an apology. \n\nShe can\u2019t arbitrarily change the rules and permanently never do dishes because she\u2019s sensitive about how you addressed this.  She\u2019s acting very immature. \n\nHonestly, my husband and I have been married for 15 years and the arrangement you had has always worked perfectly for us. One cooks and the other cleans.  No complaints. If it ever comes up in front of guests we just explain this is our arrangement and we\u2019re both really happy with it.", "NTA. Stop cooking for her. What you should have said, though, is \"I did the cooking\" when Jen's friend asked.", "The weird part to me is leaving my friends to go wash dishes.. ? I would never do that.

If she refuses to share responsibility this time, when will it end? Are you willing to let her just walk all over you? That is up to you. \n\nThough I would recommend in scenarios where you have friends over, you do dishes together. It is a shared experience and it only seems fair. She can participate in the cooking portion as well.", "NTA but you worded it in a way that will get a lot of people\u2019s backs up.

She is being childish.", "NTA. You could have worded it differently, but, it was the truth. She agreed to this division of labor until that night. So, it isn\u2019t really about washing the dishes. IMO, she\u2019s being immature to not uphold her end of the bargain (and wash the dishes when you cook) or discuss why this is bothering her. Take note of how she is handling conflict (storming off in a huff) because this scenario will repeat itself with future conflict. And, there will be conflict in every relationship.", "Tact is your friend. Maybe work on it. Your response to the friend sounded cold and clinical. Maybe a \u201cWe take turns\u201d or such would have been softer. Or even, \u201cHey, would you like some help?\u201d She\u2019s your partner, not a work colleague. (Also, her friend ate the dinner, she could have pitched into help also. Ummm.)\n\nLots of couples follow your same guidelines, but it\u2019s usually relaxed \u2014 someone has an off day, etc., the other pitches in. Maybe think about making the chores more team-based and consider softening your conversational style \u2014 there\u2019s honest and then there\u2019s blunt.", ">We also split chores on a rotation like I\u2019ll clean the bathroom one week and she\u2019ll clean it the next week.

Yea you could have been more specific, but after you cooked(i.e. did your part) it seems only reasonable that her job would be the clean up aspect. To take away some barefoot and pregnant perspective from how you phrased it shows a rather immature and incredibly insecure view on her friends part. The fact that she's not breaking this fair and balance system as a glorified tantrum is also not a good look.\n\nFrankly, were I you, I'd consider it a fair response to retract support to make a point that if she doesn't have to do her part neither do you. I'd cook only for myself, clean only the dishes I needed, and leave her to rot until she either left or was willing to at least communicate fairly rather than whatever she's doing now.", "NTA. It is a fair arrangement that if one person cooks, the other does the dishes. And if you have a dishwasher, frankly, that person is getting the much better end of the deal IMO. Jen does not sound like she is mature enough to be in a relationship. Your phrasing was not great but Jen should have just explained that OP cooked so it was her turn to do the dishes. If she is unhappy with the arrangement, she needs to negotiate a different but even distribution of the chores. Instead, her plan is to... eat your cooking and leave the dishes for you to do as well? While the obvious solution is to only cook for yourself and clean up after yourself since she refuses to compromise or negotiate, this sort of tit-for-tat is unhealthy in a relationship. If she won't meet you halfway, you may want to rethink this relationship and instead date someone who sees your relationship as teamwork.", "NTA because she could have easily followed your comment that day with \u201cyup because you cooked!\u201d and made it clear to her friends that you two have a handle on your partnership. \n\nShe\u2019s clearly immature and doesn\u2019t know how to handle uncomfortable situations. Hell, she could have even told her friends afterwards about how you two split chores but instead she is choosing to throw a tantrum. Stop cooking for her. Take this for the red flag that it is. If the red flags keep dropping, the girlfriend should be dropped.", "NTA. You could\u2019ve worded that a little better tho. While not an incorrect statement it just sounds wrong if you don\u2019t have the context", "NTA. Why doesn't she just explain your agreement to her friends instead of sulking?", "You hit on a raw nerve that a lot of women have.   It doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, exactly, but it\u2019s definitely something to be aware of.  \n\nYour girlfriend\u2019s reaction is immature.  When she gets home, sit down with her.   Apologise for what you said, then ask how you (plural) are going to resolve this issue.\n\nThe issue is that the dishes need to be washed.  A fair division of labour is important in relationships.   What does she suggest to make this work?\n\nNTA.", "NTA your gf is immature", "NTA, but you could have worded it better.", "NTA\n\nYou did word it poorly but it would have been easy to explain what was meant. She is trying to get out of pulling her weight now. You split things very fairly between the two of you and she can\u2019t just tantrum her way into doing less.", "NTA I cook you clean is pretty common. Just cook for yourself for now.", "You know if you get married this tit-for-tat attitude of her's will become your life?", "NTA\n\nI can understand how your comment sounded bad, but Jen's reaction is very disproportionate. When you said it was her job, she could have easily explained \"whoever doesn't cook has to do dishes.\" I really don't understand why she's taking it so hard because it was so obviously just a misunderstanding.", "NTA - it sounds like a reasonable agreement. My husband and I usually cook together because we enjoy spending the time together and then one of us will wash and one will dry  \ud83d\ude02 I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s any of the friends business who does which jobs. I think the reason your GF is mad at you is because of the way you worded it. You just need to explain what you meant clearly to her and find out how she thinks you guys can solve the problem. It\u2019s not a very big problem and it\u2019s common in relationships, so it\u2019s good for you guys to discuss it so you can move past it.", "NTA That\u2019s the arrangement my husband and I have. If he cooks I do the dishes. I think it\u2019s fair.", "NTA. You do them on rotation. If she doesn't want to do the dishes then she can cook.", " NTA for what you said about it being her job (although \"turn\" might have been a better word choice). I think she totally overreacted to that turn of phrase. Your friend should have kept her mouth shut and not try and insert her views into your relationship. \nThe aftermath is immature. Your gf and you need to move past a poor word choice and get back to acting like adults.", "So instead of clarifying to her own friend, in the moment, what you meant by \u201cher job\u201d - she decided to act like a petulant child. \n\nWhile also expecting you to read her mind, soothe her self inflicted ruffled feathers, and take on more responsibility?\nNaw. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You didn't word it well, but her response should have been to tell you how your wording made her feel. Maybe she hasn't been happy with that rule and this was the last straw that made her lash out. But that's not your fault. Hopefully once you have both had a little more time you can get to the root of the problem.", "Stop cooking for her cook for you and let her do her own meal and say this way we are cleaning up after our own messes and no one is cleaning after the other!

Could she have gotten in her ear?\n\nI\u2019d try to sit her down and just ask \u201cwhat is really going on here.\u201d Sure, you could have worded it differently, but that\u2019s not the problem here. Something clearly triggered her. Either her friend, or how you said it could have reminded her of bad situations from her past.", "NTA.\n\nWhile you could have worded it better, it seems your gf doesn't want to do anything to maintain a household.  Rethink this relationship.", "NTA \n\nDon't cook her SHIT. If you keep cooking for her Y-T-A. \n\nAll these people getting sensitive over the phrasing are PROJECTING. It is her job to do dishes when you cook, just like it's yours when she cooks.", "It\u2019s frustrating when people victimize themselves. That\u2019s what your girlfriend is doing, obviously listening to her friend, not standing up for herself. \n\n\u201cIt was my turn to wash dishes because he cooked. We share the chores.\u201d Easy! How hard is that?!", "NTA. But a suggestion: \n\nWhen I was younger, my best friend's dad always cooked with his wife and did dishes with her when the meal was done. This stood out to me, because I was raised in a misogynistic religious environment where the women were treated as servants of the men.\n\nI asked him about it, and he told me he worked all day, and he enjoyed spending this time, just the two of them, cooking for the kids and cleaning up together. They would stand at the sink doing the dishes while whispering and giggling together.\n\nThat always stuck with me, and nowadays, there's nothing I enjoy more than putting some music on, sipping some wine, and cooking with my husband. Even stopping here and there to slow dance when a good song comes on.\n\nTry sharing the chores since you both seem to know how to cook. Make it couple time. It may become some of your favorite memories.", "NTA\n\nIt would have taken two seconds to explain to her friends that it's YOUR JOB to cook and HER JOB to wash dishes that's what you two discussed, literally the shortest conversation.

I wouldn't take that crap. I would just not cook or only cook for myself.", "NTA sounds like you guys don't have a partnership. Dating is so much more than splitting chores, I don't think either of you were ready to play house", "NTA. While you probably didn't word it the best it still wasn't wrong.

Yes you could\u2019ve worded better but also your gf couldn\u2019t have clarified it better for her friend when her friend questioned her?\n\nWhat does she expect? That you cook and clean the dishes just because her friend questioned her?

As others have said, your wording could have been better but you were just answering the question. \n\nThat being said, am I the only one wondering why the best friend felt it appropriate to say that in the first place? Maybe it\u2019s just because the one-cooks-one-cleans arrangement is how my relationships have always worked, but that question would have probably caught me off-guard enough to have worded my response awkwardly too.", "NTA. Only cook enough for you, wash your own dishes, and that's it.\n\nI can see how she wouldn't like how you worded it, but part of being an adult in an adult relationship is using your words.\n\nShe doesn't use her words, she can cook for herself.\n\nAlso, if this issue doesn't get resolved quickly, you should probably switch to a \"We are roommates\" mentality and get out of the relationship and lease soon as possible.", "Leave. This is pathetic and it won't get better....nta", "You could have worded it better but NTA.\n\nAlso, stop cooking for her or her friends.", "NTA.  Jen needs to grow up.  The correct reply (from you and her) should be that you cooked and then she does the dishes.\n\nThat happens to be the rule in my family too.

Always clean the bathrooms?  \n\nEx I do all the cooking and cleanup after.

Ever since we say if you cook you wash up. We found this really works and stopped a lot of arguments. Only difference is when we have guests we both pitch in to do the cooking and cleaning (Mr Dishwasher does most the hard work).", "NTA. sounds like that friend got in her head about you saying it's her job", "NTA she is acting like a child about this because she was embarrassed. That said, you should have explained better to the friend. Your answer was too vague.  A better reply would be that \u201cwhoever cooks the other person washes up\u201d most reasonable people would understand that deal.

And this guy and the guests were going to hang out and wait while the GF did all the clean up? \u2026. How about folks pitch in and help in this instance? Nothing wrong with being generous vs leaving it all on one person. At any rate, you need to revisit your original agreement and hash it out again. Part of learning to live together is talking about things like this as they come up, instead of letting your passive aggressive actions do the talking. ESH.", "NTA and I can see why her friend got shocked by your response. However a little explanation to her would probably clear things up. It's not of a misogynistic source, it's just an arrangement you two have. Had she cooked the meal, you would have washed the dishes.\n\nThe only AH here is the friend, who probably poisoned her mind to think that women and men can't share the household chores. But considering she probably misunderstood, it's understandable. \n\nYour girlfriend needs to straighten up though, she knows your arrangement. And if she doesn't comply, just stop buying food for her, buy it for yourself and clean your own plate.", "NTA but your wording was stupid.

Tif she carries on like this I'd confront her about it, it just shows that she doesn't care about you or respect you enough to pull her weight in the relationship.", "NTA. I think her friend said something thinking you said \"it's her job\" like you don't do the dishes ever (I'm a man and doing the dishes is woman's job etc) Like you are treating her like a maid.

When her friend reasonably asked why you don't help with the dishes and you replied with \"it's her job\"; it sort of implied that doing the dishes in general is her job and you should have nothing to do with it, presumably because of assigned gender roles. You embarrassed her in front of her friends, and honestly, you should have known better. Assigned gender roles is unfortunately a very prominent issue which requires tactful addressing. If you'd just said \"when one of us cooks the other one does the dishes\" there would have been no issue at all. But \"it's her job\" is just a very bad way of phrasing your very reasonable arrangement, which makes your gf looks like she's content with being in a relationship from a century ago. She's also at fault by acting like a child and not discussing the problem openly with you. I'd recommend, for both of you, to learn to communicate better.", "The way you worded it did make it seem like saying that cleaning is always her job but never yours. You struck a nerve.

We know living together is harder than just dating so we sat down and agreed to several things. Like we\u2019re responsible for our own laundry. We also split chores on a rotation like I\u2019ll clean the bathroom one week and she\u2019ll clean it the next week. We agreed if one person cooks or buys the food, the other person washes the dishes. We also agreed if we have friends over, the person who cooks doesn\u2019t do the dishes rule applies. This is because we don\u2019t have huge parties, our  apartment is small, and invite over only a few friends so there\u2019s not a ton of dishes. Anyway, I like to cook and is better at it so it just works out that I cook more often. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she cooks too but much less. \n\nSo this weekend we had her best friend and her boyfriend over and I cooked the dinner. We ate and had a good time. Once dinner was done, I brought my plates and stuff to the sink then returned to my seat. We were talking and having a good time then Jen got up and told the group she wants to do the dishes before we head out. Her best friend asked why I didn\u2019t help and I answered because it\u2019s her job. I didn\u2019t think anything of it and we eventually went out.\n\nJen was acting off all week and when I ask her what\u2019s wrong, she answers she\u2019s not feeling well. Today she came home and said we need to talk. She tells me that she doesn\u2019t want to do the dishes anymore and that my answer to her friend sucked. I almost didn\u2019t know what she was talking about because I didn\u2019t realized that I did anything wrong. Then I remembered the dinner and told her that what I said was true, it was my job to cook and hers to wash. She said I could have worded it differently.\n\nSo now she refuses to wash the dishes. I said that\u2019s fine, she can cook and I\u2019ll wash the dishes and she can post it all over her social and tell her friends it\u2019s my job to wash dishes, I don\u2019t have a problem with that. She didn\u2019t like that answer either and stormed off to bed. This morning I made breakfast for both of us. She ate without saying anything then left her dirty dishes in the sink then went out. I guess she\u2019s serious about not washing the dishes again.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA with the explanation. If I had heard my friends boyfriend say that without the same context I would be like wtf too. You just worded it badly.", "NTA. My wife and I have a similar arrangement too. If she doesn\u2019t want to do either stop doing her dishes and stop cooking for her. Buy yourself some frozen meals and be done with it. You could have worded yourself better, but in the end she\u2019s the one at fault for not correcting her friends and having enough common sense to understand you are equals in this task.", "Make your own food, and wash your own dishes. Then it really is her job. Her friends have been digging her up about how you worded it and she let them. NTA, but perhaps watch your wording any time it comes to 'typical' household roles.", "My husband and I have been happily married for 6 years. \n\nPart of that happily is because of the division of responsibilities. He doesn't enjoy laundry,  I prefer laundry. So I almost always put away the laundry.  \n\nI usually also do the vacuuming.  But he almost exclusively does the dishes (which also helps me so I don't get sick because I have celiac and our roommate doesn't follow gf diet so I don't like handling dirty dishes). We both cook. I manage the schedules. He makes sure bills get paid. \n\nBeing able to divide the responsibilities together without arguments is a huge stressor that a lot of relationships haven't sorted out. It is vital to a healthy partnership. Your gf is letting wording get in the way of that.", "NTA, my SO and me do the same thing and while technically I would clean up when he cooks this has never happened ever so basically its his job to clean up after me. I don't mind always cooking and he gets a free home cooked meal that is (according to him) better than anything he could put together and all he has to do is clean a maximum of 10 (more like 5, we got a dishwasher) Mins afterwards. Considering I easily take an average 30 Mins to cook, that's a pretty good deal imo.", "Nta. I get that you should have answered more clearly but she very easily could have explained it to her friend when she brought it up. Problem solved. I think shes using this as an excuse to get out of doing either one.", "NTA. \"My response to your friend was poorly worded; I'm sorry for that and will work on being more clear in future. That said, it was unintentional on my part wheras you are deliberately creating conflict in retaliation and that is not okay. If you want me to take over dishes full-time, we can discuss that, but it will require a trade rather than me taking on more work. You can take over the cooking or laundry or some other daily chore in exchange for the dishes; otherwise I expect us to maintain the system we've both agreed is fair.\"\n\nIf she keeps refusing to trade chores and keeps leaving it all for you to do, then tell her that food prep and cleanup is now an individual responsibility, meaning you will cook for and cleanup after yourself and she needs to do the same.", "NTA. Keep cooking till all plates, cutlery etc is used up then stop cooking. \ud83e\udd23 She should have explained to her friend the mutual rules you both set in place.", "NTA", "NTA.

She needs to fully experience her choice here. Obviously she got an EARFUL from her friends who misunderstood what you were saying and told her you\u2019re being misogynistic and toxic etc. Somehow your gf didn\u2019t stand up for you and explain. So she no longer wants to participate in the \u201cI cook, you wash up\u201d deal? Fine, that means she would rather you each cook for yourselves and clean up after yourselves too. Make this abundantly clear and then carry on. Hopefully you\u2019ll be able to revisit the decision pretty quickly once she realizes this is literally twice as much work. I\u2019m assuming you share many more of the household tasks also. Because if cooking is your only job and she does literally everything else including the shopping then my answer would be completely different.", "NTA - why on Earth didn\u2019t the guests offer to help? We always have that awkward British thing where all the guests start to help and tidy and then you as the host insist that it\u2019s okay but then they insist and then proceed to wash and tidy stuff up in the total wrong way so you\u2019re going to have to do it all again but just have to politely thank them and say they shouldn\u2019t have", "NTA what you said was taken out of context.

She calmly explained her feelings.\n\nShe may not be mature enough to handle living with someone, though, and hopefully they get these kinds of issues sorted before kids, since they're so young.", "You told me that you took issue with the phrase \u201cyou hit on a raw nerve that a lot of women have\u201d because it made me sound ridiculous.   \n\nIf you don\u2019t agree with the advice I gave, that\u2019s fine.
