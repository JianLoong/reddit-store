{"id": 29744, "submission_id": "17h6igd", "title": "AITA for not wanting to spend $30k on an engagement ring?", "selftext": "Hi, first time posting here.\n\nHere's some context:\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for 5+ years. We are in our late 20's and have talked about marriage for a while now.\n\nFinancially, I am debt-free, making $200-250k per year (salary), and have $300k in savings. My girlfriend is also debt-free, making $100-150k per year (salary), and has about $150k in savings.\n\nSo I suggested that we should start talking about what kind of ring she wants - the style, size, budget, etc. Her mom is a big diamond person and loves buying big rocks. My girlfriend has a perception that expensive diamonds are normal because her mom has $30k+ rings in her collection.\n\nBefore she and I decided to talk about wedding rings, she ended up going to a jewelry shop and got some early quotes to do some preliminary research. This upset me a bit because we didn't talk about the rings ourselves. I would rather be the person to go with her and get quotes from her instead of her mom. Anyhow, she came back with quotes ranging from $30k-$50k for the ring, which seemed ridiculous to me.\n\nI understand I make good money for my age but I am also very frugal. I drive a 10-year-old Ford with 100k miles on it, do not own any luxury items, and just generally think that the extra money that I spend on the ring could be used for an extra house down payment or college fund for our kids (starting it early!) or I can fully fund our vacation together in Hawaii or something. I told her that I would be okay spending a maximum of $20k for the ring, but nothing more, and it's not because I love her less but because (at the end of the day) a diamond is a rock on your finger. It would be smarter to spend that money on things that's truly impactful to our daily lives, like a house, a better vacation, or prepping our kids better financially for the future, etc.\n\nShe got extremely upset, saying that this ring signifies our marriage and relationship and that me saying those things about suggesting cheaper rings really hurt her feelings. \"Is it wrong for me to want the best quality of the diamond on the ring?\". I obviously told her that me wanting to spend less on the ring isn't a reflection of me loving you less, but the conversation kind of didn't go anywhere from there.\n\nAITA for not wanting to spend $30k on an engagement ring? How do I navigate this conversation with her? I don't want her to feel like I love her less or she means less to me because I want to spend less on the ring. I honestly thought $15-20k was reasonable for an engagement ring despite how much money I have in my savings or my salary. Am I wrong here?\n\nEdit: I want to point out that my girlfriend is not a big spender or materialistic. She is frugal with her money as well. We plan to have a small wedding with close friends and family only. I think it really comes down to the fact that this is an engagement ring and it has a special meaning to her. \n\nEdit2: Thank you everyone for their opinions and thoughts. I will get to reading all of them at some point but as many have suggested, this starts with me talking about the wedding ring in detail with my girlfriend first. It wasn\u2019t ideal that she went to the ring shop with her mom before talking with me about it (which she apologized earlier today). I think it will help once we have a more in-depth talk about it and go to a shop together to look at rings. Lab diamonds are not an option for her (though I suggested that she should at least do some research before outright saying no to them). Again, appreciate everyone\u2019s thoughts!

For context, I\u2019m a man who recently got engaged to my fianc\u00e9: \n\n1) you\u2019re already apparently willing to drop $20k, a very large amount, while claiming the rest can be put into a college fund (?) or a house or a trip. It\u2019s $10,000 more, not $100,000 more, and you take home the difference in less than a quarter.

Is it because you think she only wants the ring because of her mom?", "You value different things, and that\u2019s okay. The question is, can you reconcile your values moving forward. She\u2019s telling you she likes expensive luxury items that don\u2019t serve another purpose. I promise you the ring won\u2019t be the only one. You should really talk to her about your comfort level with not only the ring, but cars, houses, vacations, appliances, clothes, dinner out, etc. You should both be willing to meet somewhere in the middle and if you can\u2019t come to an agreement now on the type of lifestyle you will live together as married people, you shouldn\u2019t marry each other.\nNAH", "You might not be an asshole, but damn.

I don\u2019t understand all these N-T-A comments because they say your girlfriend is an AH. \nShe\u2019s clearly not a gold digger. She has a good career, your money spending habits match otherwise.

I hate spending on materialistic things that have no utility or purpose. I don't mind spending $30k on something that will make life easier, but definitely not on something that has only aesthetic value or such.\n\nHowever, I'd happily buy that ring for my wife. (In fact, I did). I was against it first, and had bought a ring about 1-4th of that cost. My wife had no issues with it. But later, my family and relatives saw that ring and had a weird look on their faces.\n\nThen, my mom explained it to me - the engagement ring is the most precious possession for a woman. It symbolises her marriage, the status of her family, the love of her husband. It becomes a part of her identity. She likes to flaunt it, and it's not the diamond that she's flaunting, but the beauty of her relationship. And so, it should be flaunt-worthy to say the least.\n\nWithout telling my wife, I went back to the market, and got a new ring, 4X of previous one. On the day of engagement, when she saw that ring, the smile was worth it. But afterwards, I looked around and saw the faces of everyone around. Their faces made it clear that even if we don't care about that ring ourselves, the society does, the world does. And I realised that if I had given her the older ring, they'd have a look - the same look my wife will see on everyone's face when she tells them about her marriage and they check out the ring. The look that says, \"So, cheap ring, huh?\"\n\nSo while I agree with your rationale, the world works in a certain way and unfortunately, we live in that world. And if spending what I can afford onto something that can change those faces later, then why not.", "NTA- you value different things and that\u2019s okay. This will be one of MANY moments you will need to compromise. \n\nWe are in a similar financial situation as you and initially I wanted \u2018the rock\u2019 too. Once I looked into ongoing insurance on the ring, having a replica ring for when I travel, and looking at how else that money could be used I totally changed my tone. I eventually opted for a 2k moissanite ring that I never need to worry about and it\u2019s still 3 carats", "OR . . . .  You could go the traditional route of taking her shopping to get an idea of the style and colors she prefers then go buy what you decide on, in her taste and propose to her.  If her choice and price of the ring is more important  that what it symbolizes then you have revealed her shallowness about keeping up appearances being more important that what really is.  You could also choose not to have any wedding rings at all,  but she wouldn\u2019t like that either!  If you do give in then you are setting a bad precedent for the future.  You could offer to pay up to a certain price point and if she wants more she can pay the difference, she can certainly afford it.  Have you talked about money management after marriage?  Sounds like you haven\u2019t if she wants what you consider to be extravagant.", "Isn\u2019t the old \u201crule\u201d of thumb three months salary\u2026 you\u2019re getting off cheap. \nI\u2019m joking. 30k is a bit ridiculous\u2026 so is 50+. But asking Reddit is silly. You guys both make well above the average person. 30,000 to your salary equates to about 6500 to the median salary. Which is about the average spent on an engagement ring. \nNTA. But I don\u2019t think your girlfriend is as crazy as everyone thinks she is.", "NAH. You just have a difference of opinion about the matter. \n\nI agree w/you; I personally think it's wasteful to spend so much money on an engagement or wedding ring. I don't even see the need to wear rings in the first place. But that's another story.\n\nI really don't know how to compromise on this issue though.

If you were trying to insist on a c.z. instead of a natural or lab-grown gem, that would be a different story.  I see no reason a $15k - $20k budget wouldn't be a reasonable compromise.", "NTA- what you pay for the ring is your choice, she can give suggestions on cut, size, style etc but at the end it's your choice on what to buy and it is her own choice to say yes or no.", "NTA. It is ridiculous to spend that on a ring.

While I certainly can empathize with your gf wanting to be proposed to with a big rock, here are some notes your girlfriend ought to be aware of:\n\n\n- the difference between a 1.95 ct diamond and a 2.01 ct diamond is imperceptable to the eye, but it's a different price tier\n- the difference between a D and E and F diamond is imperceptable.  Likewise, G and H are still incredibly white diamonds.   Personally I think a G diamond is extremely high-end and pretty much just as white in real life, facing up, as a D that would cost significantly more.  \n- likewise, the difference between a VVS1 and even a well-selected VS2 can be imperceptable to the eye.   Now this does carry the asterisix that the inclusion has to observed.\n- lab-created diamonds are a no-brainer. Absolute no-brainer.\n- the most important thing about a diamond is the cut!  And one measurement for a good cut is a good ASET image with lots of red and blue, not a higher price! (yes, proportions matter too).  Fire and Brilliance are two things that DO matter on a ring, and it's not about money, it's about putting in the due diligence of finding the right diamond.\n- if there's a particular ring design your wife loves, you can save a ton of money by having a local goldsmith emulate it, versus purchasing a typical brand name like Tiffany or Tacori. I'm not saying to infringe on anyone's intellectual property, but chances are unless it's a custom design like the ones @RobinCallahan makes... it's probably a design that's been done before\n\n\ntl;dr - Pay attention to the PROPERTIES of the ring your gf wants.  you can stay in budget and probably get her a ring that's better.  But get pictures of the ring she wants to be proposed with, not the quotes.  You don't propose with a card that says it's a D VVS1... you brag to socialites with that.\n\np.s. diamond rings are a waste of money. But our culture puts a lot of emotional worth on them so factor that in. I don't think it's shallow to want to be proposed to by the love of your life with a keeper ring... it's just lacking in perspective.\n\np.p.s get in touch with the dude at distinctivegem.com.  He has a good eye for diamonds.", "Dude, $30,000 is roughly what a person would make working full-time at minimum wage in a year. It's crazy that she would expect that much on a ring.

What would happen if: you got mugged, lost the ring, it got damaged, etc. All questions involving things that could go wrong.

Good luck!", "Your budget is also above what I'd consider frugal haha. I think this is a NAH. You both need to talk about money and how you want to use it in the future. She wants a 30-50k dollar ring, you want a 15-20k dollar ring, and yes, she's normally frugal, but she's probably going to want more jewelry like that in the future, and if she's tying it to your relationship, she might think other jewels are similarly important. What's your budget for your wedding ring? Does she expect a blue topaz anniversary? How about the diamond anniversary? If it's really, truly just this one ring... is 30k vs 20k really the argument you want to have?", "You are NTA for wanting to put a limit on the price of the ring.\n\nHowever, I think there is some cognative dissonance in your statements here:\n\n>I want to point out that my girlfriend is not a big spender or materialistic. She is frugal with her money as well. We plan to have a small wedding with close friends and family only. I think it really comes down to the fact that this is an engagement ring and it has a special meaning to her. \n\nIf she is frugal, not materialistic, not a big spender, etc. the meaning of the ring should have no significant connection to the price. That she would be able to see the special meaning in a ring that cost $3000 or even $300 as much as one that cost $30,000.\n\nBecause the real value in engagement/wedding rings is not how much was paid for them. It is in the marriage that they symbolize itself. You can spend a few hundred $ and have a marriage that lasts for your lifetimes just as easily as you can pay tens of thousands and have a marriage that crumbles in a few years. Either way, how much you pay for the rings is unlikely to have a significant impact on how strong your marriage is.\n\nOne obvious possibility to consider is that her mom's influence on this topic has overridden her otherwise frugal mindset.\n\nAnother possibility, maybe she's frugal... when it's her money. What are your plans for sharing your finances? If you haven't discussed that yet, you may need to. If you are going to be merging your finances even partially, some conversation on why she's ok with spending that much of what will be your collective savings may be warranted. If you're going to stay separate, the question of whether she's ok with the amount because it won't be her money being spent may be relevant.\n\nAnother thought to consider... how much are you planning on spending on your wedding band? Is it even in the same ballpark as her engagement ring? Or is it likely to be a small fraction of the cost of her ring? (Side-note is that $30k for the engagement ring alone or the combined wedding set?)\n\nIf, for example, her engagement ring does cost $30k, but your wedding band only cost $3k, what does that signify about your marriage and relationship? I'm not saying the prices have to be similar. However, if someone is attaching significant meaning about the relationship to the price of one person's ring(s) but not the other, it is certainly worthy of at least a raised eyebrow or two.\n\nUltimately, I think that, no matter how she may be normally, she does sound materialistic here. Figuring out the deeper why will help a lot.", "Jeebus. Some people just have too much money. I'm sorry but 30k for a ring is obscene.", "NTA, but I do understand her wanting her engagement ring to be the nicest one she owns. You\u2019re both very well off so I can see her being concerned this one won\u2019t be her nicest one and she wants it to be. While $30-$50k is an insane number to me, it\u2019s actually pretty inline with what my husband spent on my ring if you look at it as a percentage of income. Is there some other way to make it meaningful, like a family stone or a special designer or something? At the end of the day she sees this as the most important thing while you don\u2019t. You\u2019ll have to figure out if you can understand each others view points and if you can compromise.", "NTA. A real partner would rather put that money in the bank or invest it properly.", "I have VERY expensive jewelry because my DH loved to buy it for me but 30k on an engagement ring give me a break.

Also, marriages that started with expensive rings a lot of times don\u2019t last. So which one does she want?", "Definitely NTA. \n\n$20K on an engagement ring is plenty of money. \n\nAt least OP knows what he is signing up for.

If an engagement rings price determined the success of the marriage, then me and my fiance might as well quit now \ud83d\ude02 i think he said he spent $50 on mine. But it's also everything i wanted in a ring. \n\nUltimately, i think it's more impractical that the ring is something she will love. Perhaps you guys can go look at rings, but not get estimates at first. Find styles, designs, etc. Figure out what she likes in terms of style. Then go through and get the estimates yourself. And don't tell her how much you spend, whether you spend what she wants or less.", "NAH.\n\nSpending $30k on a ring is stupid. Spending $20k on a ring is stupid too. \n\nI completely agree with you that the amount you spend on a ring is not correlated with how much you love or value someone, but your girlfriend is entitled to her (wrong) opinion too. She's saying, \"I feel like you love me less if you don't do this\", and that's something you need to find a way to address even if you disagree with her. \n\nMaybe you can spend the money on an over-the-top proposal. Maybe you can spend it on an incredible wedding or honeymoon. Maybe you can use some family jewels to make it extra meaningful for her without breaking the bank. Maybe her mom would let you buy a diamond from her, and then she could reserve that money for your future kid or something? I dunno, just trying to think outside the box here. Try to figure out why the ring in particular will make her feel valued when other things won't, and maybe you can find a compromise. \n\nBut anyway, you're not an asshole for not wanting to spend the extra money. Your girlfriend is ridiculous but also not an asshole for wanting you to spend the money. If you can't work something out, then maybe this relationship just isn't meant to be.", "All I can say is my ring is a $7 infinity ring from Amazon.

In your case I believe her mom has influenced her thinking on this. Especially if she's frugal like you said. NTA. I hope you come to an agreement that works for both of you without the hefty unessacary price tag.", "NAH. Given your incomes and the fact that,  according to your updates, you're both frugal and not generally materialistic, I don't think $30k for an engagement ring is outrageous.\n\nOutrageous for me, maybe (my ring is moissanite by choice and by far the most valuable piece of jewelry I own for what it represents) but you're not marrying me.

Yes, it is **a lot** of money to spend on a ring. But it since you mentioned that she\u2019s generally responsible with money, I think she is of the opinion this specifically, being a personal item to be worn every day, is worth the money. And it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019d be completely out of the realm of possibility in regards to *(both of)* your finances. \n\nIf you think this might be the reason, I have a suggestion for a possible solution. It is pretty untraditional though, and probably not for everyone *(steer clear if you\u2019ve assumed correctly about her reasoning.)* \nBut what if the two of you compromise by you committing to paying the $20k and then she can make up the difference, so that she gets a ring in a desired price range without you superseding the budget you\u2019ve decided on? \n\nPersonally, if I were to get married to someone, I\u2019d prefer this arrangement more so than my partner paying in full but me not getting the ring of my dreams.

I\u2019m not someone who shops for clothes often/ I have never owned anything designer in my life and savings/ retirement are a priority, but I love nice jewelry. My love ring has my family\u2019s birth years in it. My school ring signifies the hard work and memories it took to get that degree. My pinky ring was one of the first things I bought after getting a real job. I got a pair of nice earrings after the toughest work experience of my life. Are these everyday things? No. Was anything else sacrificed to get them and did I go into debt to buy them? No. Donating to orgs I believe in, supporting my community, and investing in my future are important, but those aren\u2019t exclusive from having pretty (and sometimes pricy) things that are absolutely a privilege. I didn\u2019t grow up with a lot, so that\u2019s also probably a reason I love to mark milestones with these things. \n\nI get the mentality of wanting something you see/ wear everyday to be exactly what you want if you can afford it and you and your partner are on the same page. NAH unless things change as y\u2019all talk it out.\n\nNOTE: \n\nRegardless of if this ring is your price range or your future fianc\u00e9\u2019s, get it insured against loss and theft ASAP. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT TAKE IT NEAR WATER BEFORE DOING SO!!", "This is so interesting to me. This is anecdotal obviously but I don\u2019t know anyone among my physician colleagues who has spent more than 15k on a ring. Maybe we carry more debt? Or the expectations are less ostentatious.

That\u2019s something I value. My boyfriend loves antique typewriters and collects them. They bring him joy. I could give 2 shits and would rather spend that money on a ridiculously small portion of something delicious. But we compromise and it\u2019s all good, I like seeing him happy more than the cool experience, and he buys less typewriters for the same reason. Balance. \n\nI said NAH, because I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s an asshole for wanting something nice. I actually agree with you that this expensive of a ring in relationship to their income is reasonable. My point is, they are having a difference of opinion on this, and it signals a need for a larger conversation on how they want to structure their finances. And if they can\u2019t come to an agreement now, it will be a conflict in their relationship forever. Even with the edit, I still feel like they should TALK IT OUT.", "I don't know why people keep bringing up their total earning or saving when it's OP who will pay for it, as a \"gift\" of some sort to his wife-to-be, and in the event of separation will most likely still be in the woman's possession.\n\nAlthough I also agree \\~12% of his annual income (I'm shooting at 250k here) doesn't seem like it's absurd, but to me personally spending on something like a ring that is more than my monthly salary is not something I'm comfortable with.", "Expecting a 30k ring and thinking 20k is cheap is being \"hella materialistic,\" no matter how frugal you are in other areas.\n\nSpending 3k on an espresso machine or a piece of art is \"having one nice thing,\" a 30k ring is ten nice things.", "But girls before and after marriage are much different.

My daughter dated a boy and his Mother.  She had opinions on everything.  Mom said he had to buy a 2 carat diamond engagement ring. Daughter and bf went shopping and bought the ring they liked.  Mom said no!  She knew someone who had that ring.  Finally Mom bought the ring and gave it to her son so he could propose. It was insanely expensive for a college students income.  They were only officially engaged for three months before the wedding.  When she had to wear the diamond and the guard...it was to much.  She wears it to work, otherwise it sits in her jewelry box.
