He should have talked to you beforehand.", "NTA. Your father didn't offer you a free car. He offered you a used, broken-down SUV for the price of your current car. Who would take that offer?", "NTA\n\nA damaged vehicle, purchased at auction can be a risky gamble. I would stick with a car I have owned, know the history on and still runs well and will have lower overall cost of ownership. It was a nice gesture for your dad to make but you shouldn't feel guilty about declining his offer.", "NTA- why would you sell a working car for a non working car? Especially when you like your car.", "NTA and no is a complete sentence.", "NTA. If your car runs fine he's not doing you any favors by selling (that's what he's doing because you owe him the sales price of your current car) you a newer but broken car.", "NTA. Your car is older but runs better than this lemon he is trying to load off to you. Tell your dad no. No is a complete sentence. You don't need the added expense when something goes wrong with that car.", "NTA - It is your life and if you feel you arent ready for it then you arent. Only you know whether you can handle it or not.", "NTA, you\u2019re being a completely reasonable adult. Why is he trying to run your life?", "NTA - but your dad is a massive asshole.  You're already struggling - and his \"suggestion\" is basically using you to better his own life.  Stand strong on your decision and don't let him pressure you.    \n\n\nPS. I love my car too and would be offended if anyone wanted to take it from me.", "NTA. I can understand that he might've gone through a long process to get this car, which may be a grand gesture to him, but he didn't ask you first if you were even in the market for a new car. To me, it sounds like he might've even bought the car for himself first, realized the extent of the damage, and then thought that it would be justified if it were fixed up and \"traded\" for your current car, but this is just a thought. It sounds like you're having levelheaded, reasonable thoughts!", "NTA. This is a bad deal. You take on the risk of a damaged auction car and he gets the sure thing of your old car's sell price. This seems more like a grift than a gift.", "Something about this arrangement stinks. Did he find out he ended up with a lemon? You have a car that works, end of story, thank you dad but no thank you.\n\nNTA, and I wish you the best on your recovery. You don't need unwanted stress so I encourage you to set firm boundaries if needed.", "NTA - a free car is not free. You are taking on the insurance and running costs. It is perfectly reasonable to refuse.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t let your dad pile more problems on your shoulders.  Reiterate \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d then tell him the subject is closed and he needs to move on.", "NTA. It sounds like more stress on your end. It's nice of him to try to help, but that isn't the help that you need right now.", "NTA. Sounds like he is up to something here.", "NTA. That car would be no gift, it would be a costly burden. And I have a hard time believing your Dad doesn't know that.", "The car wasn't offered as a gift. It sounds like he wants to use your car to fund his fun project car. You'd get an SUV on the other end....maybe....but there's no guarantee it would not take the entire sale price of your car and then some to fix it up.  Nope. You aren't wrong to refuse to take on financing a project you don't want, need, and didn't agree to!  NTA", "NAH. Sounds like, according to your post, he bought it first, then offered up the idea. He asked, you said no. End of story.\n\nIf he based his decision to buy it on an agreement ya'll had, then you changed your mind, it would be a different story.\n\nHe may see things differently in the appeal of it, and be willing to argue about it.
