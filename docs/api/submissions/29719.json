Even if she did lose a family member, the burden is still on her to communicate that to you and your professor. You are not a mind reader. You can't know what's going on in her head or in her personal life unless she communicates it to you.\n\nShe didn't even need to take the time to do it herself. She could have given her phone/computer to a trusted family friend and said \"Hey email my professor that I'm unable to complete this assignment due to these circumstances, and to pass that along to my partner.\"\n\nGrief is hard, losing family is hard, but it doesn't mean you get to abandon all of your responsibilities. If she ghosted her job without telling them, she'd lose it.", "NTA - They didn't communicate and didn't put forward their work at the relevant time. I've done this myself because I've worked with some lazy or uncommunicative group members before. You definitely should tell the professor as it is your body of work and extra considerations should be made considering it is supposed to be the work of two people. Sure it sucks that they're going through a hard time, but you know what you do? You say \"sorry, I'm going through a rough patch so I'm not going to be as communicative\" and then give you an idea of when they can get it done and if need be explain it to the professor and possibly get an extension. Either way, none of this is your fault.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t snitch with any malice. I understand losing a family member is hard but she could have texted you back at some point. No need to feel like you\u2019re the villain.", "NTA \n\nShe could have just told you, it took literally two minutes to text \"hey, I've just lost a family member I will be sending you my part ASAP\" or telling your professor who could have give you a heads up. I know it sounds harsh but the world doesn't stop when we have problems (any kind) and we can't expect people around us to just accommodate to our needs, SPECIALLY when we don't even say them. \n\nEnjoy your well earned grade.", "NTA. The fact that the professor didn't even seem to know she lost a family member suggests her excuse is BS. Even if she was telling the truth, it takes 5 seconds to reply to your text and tell you. \n\nYou had every right to tell the professor and she has no one to blame but herself.", "NTA\n\nFirst, she chose not to communicate with you about this loss of a family member\n\nSecond, I'm not sure I believe her. If she had her part done the night it was due, then she could have responded immediately to the professor with \"I was having a family emergency. Blahblah was dying. But I did the work, please find my half attached\". And I'm sure if that happened, the professor would likely cut her a break and let her make it up somehow (say, by completing the project in her own way)", "NTA, college is where you need to learn to get your act together and develop good working habits. If she did have a family member die, that's very unfortunate, but it's still her responsibility to at least email the professor, and they can contact you about it. I kinda feel like she is making up that family members death to make you feel bad because otherwise, how did she have enough time to get her half done but not have even a second to answer one text?", "NTA\n\n>By the night it was due, I had finished both of our parts\n\nSo she had her part done, but didn't send it to you (or the professor) even when time was running out. What did she expect? If you don't submit a project on time, you would fail.", "NTA, you\u2019re adults like you said and part of that is communicating and taking accountability for your actions. Clearly your group mate doesn\u2019t do either of those and expects people to just do everything for them apparently. Group mate played the classic game of fuck around  and find out, they fucked around in getting their end of the bargain done and they found out that not everyone will take kindly to that, potentially like everyone has done for sed group mate their entire life. Humble pie served.", "NTA and there's no particular reason to believe her. An email explanation would have taken her less than a minute. I'd tell her that putting her name on a project that she didn't participate in would be unethical and a violation of ANY University's honor code. She did not submit her portion or communicate with you in any way. Therefore, whatever happens between her and the professor is none of your business.  And that's what I'd tell her... Tell it to the professor, all I did is tell the truth- my partner ghosted me and therefore I did the entire project solo. Screw you for letting me think I needed to do the whole thing because you couldn't be unassed to send me a 30 second text.  I spend many hours doing your work because you NEVER participate in class or respond in anyway. There is no reason for me to have believed you were going to do anything. So I have ZERO sympathy for the problems you created for yourself when you couldn't be bothered to let me know ANYTHING at ANYPOINT EVER in this semester.", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t believe this girl.  If a family member had passed away, she was perfectly capable of texting you to let you know.  And how is it that she was too upset to send you a text message but she was okay enough to finish her portion of the work on time?  It just doesn\u2019t add up. \n\nAnd anyways, if for some weird reason she truly lost a family member and also just absolutely couldn\u2019t bring herself to send you the work she completed, then she can present proof of the death to the professor and she can also turn her portion of the work in that she claims she did (fat chance).  \n\nReally, you don\u2019t owe this girl anything beyond trying to communicate with her during the project.  You did your duty.  You can wash your hands of any guilt.", "NTA.\n\nEven if shes telling the truth, you aren't psychic. You can't be blamed for not being told. And she should be speaking to the teacher about an extension to get her part graded and not insulting you.\n\nIt's not your job to do someone elses coursework when you need to be focusing on your other exams. You did everything and you deserve for that to show in your grade.", "NTA. If her story is true and she was able to do the work the night it was due, she could've messaged you at the same time. She could also have contacted the professor for an extension. She could've contacted you at any point after the deadline. Funny how she was only now able to contact you... to express her anger.\n\nThe word 'snitch' isn't appropriate for situations where you're the wronged party. Victims of fraud who contact the authorities are not snitches. Kids who report bullies to the school are not snitches. You were standing up for yourself.", "If she had her part \u201cright here\u201d she still deserves an F because it\u2019s not supposed to be sitting next to her, but turned in however many days ago. You reached out and she never responded, not even to explain she had to focus on the loss of a conveniently general family member or that she\u2019d completed her part and was going to hold onto it forever for sh-ts and giggles. \n\nNTA and good for you for standing up for yourself. She can always explain her situation to the professor and let them decide if she deserves some slack, but that\u2019s not your job.", "NTA. If she didn't do any of the work, why should her name be on it? If she **did** do her portion, why didn't she send it to you, or ask you for your portion, so that your whole project could be turned in? The fact that she didn't respond to your communication makes it reasonable for you to have assumed she wouldn't contribute anything.\n\n(By the way, I'm not saying your partner is a liar, but my wife is a university professor, and you would not believe how frequently her students lose family members whenever papers are due. It's like going to college is a death sentence for extended family.)", "NTA\n\nShe didn't say jack shit to you or your professor.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It didn't matter who did what, as long as the project was done.\n\nI remember in a college class someone tried this and said his three partners didn't do anything and the professor gave them a 0. (First time I could recall it happening.)\n\nThe other three students sued and won, getting As in the class, because the requirement for the project said they would be graded on the final project, not how much they did.\n\nWith how sue happy the US is, I honestly expect this to happen more often.", "YTA, honestly shitty move", "NTA, yes she may be hurting from loosing a family member but she had the entire time of the project to just text you letting you know or to contact the instructor to notify them. Honestly this situation effected your grades as well from having to do extra work. The instructor also should have noticed that they hadn\u2019t been coming to class and done something then. If the instructor wants to be lenient then that\u2019s their prerogative. Group projects in college suck.", "NTA this is very common where I come from lol.", "If she lost someone, she can send you the obituary, otherwise she's full of crap. NTA", "NTA\n\nWhat a lame excuse!", "NTA - you're not psychic. If she had her part done, she needed to tell you. She could also just be making all of that up. If she really did lose a family member, she needed to tell the professor that, and get an extension. Sounds like she's being manipulative, or she didn't handle it well.\n\nIt's more likely that she's gotten away with this tons of times in the past, and expected you to be a doormat too, but there were actual consequences this time, so instead of taking accountability, she's trying to guilt-trip you. Don't fall for it. Even if she did some work and/or lost a family member, a group project is about communication and working together - you still did all the work. She didn't communicate with you, so obviously that left you in the position of having to do everything. Even if she had done something last minute and suddenly sent it, it wouldn't change the fact that you had to do everything because she hadn't communicated at all. But I'd wager she didn't do any work at all, and is just trying to make you feel bad.", "NTA - it was her responsibility to get in touch with you and/or the professor if she was suffering from a death in the family.  Just because tragedy hits doesn't mean you have no responsibilities.  All she had to do was shoot an email.\n\nedit:  Also only 12 year olds call each other snitches.  You're in college FFS.", "NTA  She's lying to try to guilt you and probably the professor too!  Don't ever allow her to be partnered with you again as she can't be trusted. You are fine and don't let people guilt you!", "NTA . She could have emailed the professor and let her know she lost someone and could have potentially gotten an extension. And actually communicate and let you know .", "It depends on the teacher, and your rubric, tbh\n\nIt's becoming more and more common for teachers to hang out \"surveys\" at the end of a group project, where you \"rate\" each person in the group, and their contributions \n\n- source, I graduated with my criminal justice degree in 2018 and this was common practice at my college", "YTA, this comment is a shitty move.\n\nThey gave their 'partner' ample opportunity to communicate.\n\nThey might have lost someone (maybe), but that is a reason, not an excuse to fail to contact their 'partner' who just so conveniently did all their work for them.\n\nOP, NTA.", "I had some classes do that, but they only affect like 10% of a grade. People probably should read the rubric before they try something. A teacher might give the entire group a 0 because they didn't do a 'group' project.", "I have never had a teacher do that, ever\n\nI have done what op did though\n\nEta, group projects are stupid anyway, all they are are an irritation\n\nCertain classmates take advantage of the system you're talking about and the fact that no one else wants to fail\n\nIt's dumb"]}
