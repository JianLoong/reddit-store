I was happy to act out the traditions at my ex husband's request, but I've always strived to be honest with my kids. So when the questions started I wasn't going to outright ruin the magic, but I wasn't going to lie to my kids' faces either.

How do you think it might work?\")\n\nThe last tooth fairy incident we had my oldest was skeptical, and I encouraged to her write a note to the tooth fairy. She had some questions. I wrote a note back without giving the answer away, and she figured it out after some thought.

We find magic in rainbows, a beautiful sunset, learning how magnets work, growing plants from seeds, learning how to use our imagination to write stories and draw pictures. \n\nKids need to learn critical thinking. Some pick it up on their own naturally, and some need a little help. My youngest child adamantly believes her best friend at preschool is a robot who has skin over his metal, \"because he told me, and he said he wasn't lying.\" It's something we've been working through.
