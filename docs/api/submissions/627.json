I feel your reasoning is ok and you did the right thing, but you could have asked the little girl to get out nicer than you had. I do feel your grandma and mom do not need to gossip and it wasn't needed.", "YTA. Yelling at guests in your home is rude. Guiding her out calmly while advising her of the rule would be the correct response.", "NTA. Sounds like you were caught off guard and it was a knee jerk reaction. A 7 YO should know better than go into other people's rooms uninvited when in someone's house visiting, especially since she has been there before and knows the rules. That was rude. You were a bit rude too but thats your room and not your guests.", "eh, i mean, you could\u2019ve been a little nicer.", "NTA. Rule or no rule, you have the right to privacy regarding your own room. If they want to let the kids elsewhere, that\u2019s their problem.", "NTA she\u2019s doing what she\u2019s not supposed to do lmao not even a question", "YTA. You we're right to stop her but your manner in doing so was assholery. No need to yell.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was one of the adults who was sort of looking after the teens as well as the kids. One of the things we noticed, was that the way the teens sometimes spoke, was quite harsh. It\u2019s not necessarily that they were tying to be mean or anything but still, the way that it would sometimes come out sounded very mean. And to be honest, I worked a similar job a couple of times when I was a teen and I was pulled aside once by my boss to tell me that the way I was speaking sometimes sounded a bit mean, and that I just needed to make sure that even if I\u2019m reprimanding someone or if I\u2019m reminding people about rules, etc. that I do it in a way that doesn\u2019t sound mean. Because it is a great way to upset a kid and even worse, to upset that child\u2019s adults, if they hear it. Not saying that teens are always like that, and I\u2019m not saying that its what happened here. But it is a trend I noticed among the dozen teens that I worked with over my time at this place.\n\nSometimes we need to think about what we\u2019re going to say, how we\u2019re going to say it, and how it\u2019s likely to arrive. It\u2019s not just teens who need to do this but everyone, I just think maybe most teens haven\u2019t really developed this skill yet or realized it yet. I don\u2019t know. But especially with kids you need to make sure that you are coming across a certain way so as not to upset them or anything. You can be firm and explain the rule but still do it in a way that doesn\u2019t sound overly harsh to a kid\u2019s ears. Obviously yes, you have a right to privacy in your room, and yes there is a rule that that part of the house is off limits. It sounds like the only part someone had a problem with was the way you went about telling the kid that. Even if you didn\u2019t mean to be mean, it sounds like that\u2019s how it came across. Maybe in the future, like I said, you could make an effort to ensure that what you\u2019re saying is going to come across in the right way. It\u2019s not just good for kids, but it\u2019s a good life skill.\n\nI am going to say NAH. Like I said, I don\u2019t think you meant to be mean but it sounds like it may have been a bit mean the way you said it.", "INFO: Did anyone made sure the 7yo understood that the area was offlimit?", "I'm not sure if anyone told her, but she wasn't going to the bathroom. There's another guest bathroom that's kinda close to the garage door, so not the bathroom.
