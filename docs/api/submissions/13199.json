I can understand that maybe, sometimes you go toilet and wipe and don't realise there is a small amount of blood on the toilet seat. But next time you go toilet and notice it, you clean it up!

Make sure she sees this", "NTA but I have some questions. A little bit of blood on the toilet seat simply will not make the whole bathroom smell like blood. How much blood was this?\n\nIs it possible that roommate actually cannot see this blood but the guys can? I have had the experience before where I realized that period blood got on the bottom of my toilet seat only when I went to do regular toilet cleaning because I never lift up my toilet seat for any reason (I do not pee standing up). It's surprisingly easy to get blood on the bottom of a toilet seat if you use tampons or a cup, and I guess maybe the roommate couldn't see it when both of the guys could?\n\nI would say period blood is a lot less gross than something like poop, but I find it ultra strange that a person would bleed on a toilet seat, see it every day, and just do nothing about it (if not for their roommates, just for themselves).", "NTA I used to get debilitating cramps (endometriosis) and even at my worst period pain if I got blood anywhere I cleaned it up.

My mess = my responsibility. On the days when I really can't do that level of checking and I know my symptoms will be acting up I'll text a warning to my roommates. i have several disabilities impacting my mobility, cognition, pain, memory, continence, and ability to clean up after myself and NONE of that is an excuse to expose people to my bodily fluids without their consent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToilet paper is right there, and if developing the habit of checking and/or wiping after you use the toilet is that difficult then you have larger issues going on that you need to address. shifting blame doesn't help you or the people who live with you.", "NTA they are ratchet AF.", "NTA.

I am female, I have bled and have severe cramps when I do. If I got blood on any toilet it'd be cleaned before I left the bathroom.", "You are definitely not the asshole.

There's just no excuse.", "Take it from a woman with medical conditions which make my period pain 10x worse than that of those with regular periods- it isn't difficult.
