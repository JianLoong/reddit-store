Fine to be disappointed to have less time with the kids but to go NC or LC is just odd.\n\nYou want to spend time with your kids now that you're able is perfectly fine.  YOU are the parent and there are only so many years with your kids.", "NTA\n\nAnn was not treating you as a parent and - based on your conversation - you may have enabled that. \n\nYou should know where your children are and Ann should have gotten your permission for activities before involving your kids. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve wanted to but haven\u2019t confronted Ann in the past. This is problematic. By giving her free rein, you\u2019ve helped create an environment where Ann feels entitled to do what she wants. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about your work situation but take this change as an opportunity to reset your relationships and exert your rights as parents. \n\nIf Ann asks for time with your kids, try to be involved and to initially supervise.

It\u2019s not your fault that this makes her mad, nor is it up to you to placate her.", "Nta but uh...  that's super concerning. It sounds like she's trying to ice you out as the parent, and that you spending time with your own child is you \"kidnapping\" them from her.", "NTA. She's clearly using your kids and living through you. She's pissed bc you allowed the behavior to slide and escalate. You allowed her to take your kids places without asking.\n\nYou let her have control under the guise of safety. \n\nLet her be mad. These are not her kids. She does not call the shots.", "NTA- trust your instincts. Take Ann off the approved list for pickup of your children.

She's the one ruining family dynamics by acting like a baby. She should be happy for kids to get more time with their mom.\n\nYour phrasing for that phone call wasn't great. You aren't happy to spend time with the kids, you are going to spend time with your kids. Going to pick them up from school. She doesn't need to tell you that's okay. You don't need her permission. Don't treat someone as though they have power they don't. Sometimes people need to hear, \"I appreciate your help, but I've got this.\"", "NTA. Since your work hours were reduced, it was natural you would want to spend more time with your kids. Ann's reaction was very odd. I would not trust her. She sounds like a character in a horror movie that feels she is the real mother and has the right to take the kids away with her.", "NTA. You\u2019re correct in your feelings, but you\u2019re right about the fragility of family dynamics as well. She\u2019s an aunt who wants to have a meaningful connection with the kids and that\u2019s kind of rare even if she is a bit quirky about it.", "NTA but where is your husband in all of this? They\u2019re your kids, she can kick rocks. If hubby hasn\u2019t had your back vocally with aunt and family than he sucks too", "I completely agree. \n\n>So one day I phoned Ann and told her that since I was working fewer hours, I would be happy to spend some quality time with my kids and so I would like to go pick them from school. I said that was a temporary thing and that it was ok for her to spend time with them once in a while. She told me that she \"would do everything for the kids\" (something she has said a lot of times) but that it was ok.\n\nOP, you speak to her way too passively. There are ways to be kind but still firm and direct when stating what will happen as the parent. You don't need to tell her you *would be happy* to spend time with your own children and that you *would like* to pick them up. You say, \"Thank you for all the pickups you've done. My work schedule has shifted so I will be picking the kids up starting tomorrow.\" \n\nYou should also have addressed this with MIL a long time ago by asking her why Ann was picking up the kids instead of her. \n\nI would remove Ann as a pickup person and only have you, husband and MIL. She's overstepping her bounds.", "Definitely agree with cutting Ann off from future pickups. \n\nOP - it\u2019s ridiculous and more than a little concerning that Ann is saying she\u2019s angry about your phone call. You bent over backwards (without needing to) to be conciliatory to her. Disappointed? Yes, that would be completely understandable. But her feeling entitled to say she is angry just because you are making a parental decision - that\u2019s concerning. \n\nThis \u201canger\u201d as well as her past actions have shown how little she thinks of your ability and rights as parents. Unless she changes her expectations and becomes more realistic about her role within your family, having her interacting with your kids may lead to serious issues. \n\nPlease do not try to make up to Ann. Let her keep her distance and let her continue - without any attention from you - her attempts to make you feel guilty or in the wrong. \n\nTalk to your husband and MIL about your concerns about Ann\u2019s overstepping, recent reaction, and your preference for more distance with her (given her behavior)."]}
