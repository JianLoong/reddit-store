She's the one ruining family dynamics by acting like a baby. She should be happy for kids to get more time with their mom.\n\nYour phrasing for that phone call wasn't great. You aren't happy to spend time with the kids, you are going to spend time with your kids. Going to pick them up from school. She doesn't need to tell you that's okay. You don't need her permission. Don't treat someone as though they have power they don't. Sometimes people need to hear, \"I appreciate your help, but I've got this.\"", "NTA. Since your work hours were reduced, it was natural you would want to spend more time with your kids. Ann's reaction was very odd. I would not trust her. She sounds like a character in a horror movie that feels she is the real mother and has the right to take the kids away with her.", "NTA. You\u2019re correct in your feelings, but you\u2019re right about the fragility of family dynamics as well. She\u2019s an aunt who wants to have a meaningful connection with the kids and that\u2019s kind of rare even if she is a bit quirky about it.", "NTA but where is your husband in all of this? They\u2019re your kids, she can kick rocks.

I said that was a temporary thing and that it was ok for her to spend time with them once in a while. She told me that she \"would do everything for the kids\" (something she has said a lot of times) but that it was ok.\n\nOP, you speak to her way too passively. There are ways to be kind but still firm and direct when stating what will happen as the parent. You don't need to tell her you *would be happy* to spend time with your own children and that you *would like* to pick them up. You say, \"Thank you for all the pickups you've done. My work schedule has shifted so I will be picking the kids up starting tomorrow.\" \n\nYou should also have addressed this with MIL a long time ago by asking her why Ann was picking up the kids instead of her. \n\nI would remove Ann as a pickup person and only have you, husband and MIL. She's overstepping her bounds.", "Definitely agree with cutting Ann off from future pickups. \n\nOP - it\u2019s ridiculous and more than a little concerning that Ann is saying she\u2019s angry about your phone call. You bent over backwards (without needing to) to be conciliatory to her. Disappointed? Yes, that would be completely understandable. But her feeling entitled to say she is angry just because you are making a parental decision - that\u2019s concerning. \n\nThis \u201canger\u201d as well as her past actions have shown how little she thinks of your ability and rights as parents. Unless she changes her expectations and becomes more realistic about her role within your family, having her interacting with your kids may lead to serious issues. \n\nPlease do not try to make up to Ann. Let her keep her distance and let her continue - without any attention from you - her attempts to make you feel guilty or in the wrong. \n\nTalk to your husband and MIL about your concerns about Ann\u2019s overstepping, recent reaction, and your preference for more distance with her (given her behavior).", "NTA. But...where is your husband is all this? Why isn't he setting some boundaries? He's an ah for not taking charge of this--she is HIS aunt!", "I get the feeling that your daughter is the aunts fantasy daughter.\n\nWouldn't be surprised if she introduces her as *her* daughter to strangers.\n\nShe's mad cuz you've kidnapped *her* kid from her. \n\nEven in you go back to more hours... I'd find a way to limit contact. You have no clue what ideas she's putting in your kids heads \n\nNTA", "NTA, but if you like having your children, I'd suggest removing Ann's access from them.\n\n> I feel better if she is not around, as she makes me unconfortable.\n\nSomething something trust your gut, mumble mumble read \"Gift of Fear,\" and remember that women can be predators, abusers and kidnappers too.\n\nComedy response: wow, she really thinks of them as 'her kids....' are you sure they're yours?", "*So one day I phoned Ann and told her that since I was working fewer hours, I would be happy to spend some quality time with my kids and so I would like to go pick them from school. I said that was a temporary thing and that it was ok for her to spend time with them once in a while. She told me that she \"would do everything for the kids\" (something she has said a lot of times) but that it was ok.*\n\nWhy would you say that?  All you needed to tell her was that your schedule has changed and you will be picking up YOUR children from now on.\n\nEveryone let Ann indulge in the fantasy she had that these were her children. That needed to be shut down. Your children are not hers but yours.\n\n*Ann has been usually polite to me but I have always felt she was strange in some way, especially after we had kids.*\n\n*My concern with Ann picking them from school is that she drives them around in her car, she takes them places, she never asks us parents for permission or tell us where they are going.*\n\n*. I won't lie, I feel better if she is not around, as she makes me unconfortable. But my kids loved spending time with her and she seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with them.*\n\nYour motherly instincts are telling you that Ann is exceeding proper boundaries with your children. She just needs to drop them off at your house, not take them for rides without your permission. You need to know where your children are at all times. Take her off the school emergency list.\n\nYou need to talk to your husband and get on the same page. Together you need to talk to Ann. *She told MIL she is angry at us because of that phone call I made. -*So? let her be angry. She is not the children's' parent or guardian and doesn't get a say in how you are raising them. She needs to ask permission before she takes them anywhere. Remind her that these are YOUR children not hers. If she can't deal with that, go LC with her.", "For me, the very first time aunt took the kids elsewhere without getting the ok would be the very last time she did pick up.  OP needs to nut up.", "Here's the thing...OP is being polite because she needs aunt to pick them up again when her work schedule changes. Or, at least, she needs someone else to pick them up. So she's taking advantage of aunt doing it and aunt is taking advantage of that need and taking more time than offered.\n\nI think OP was being too passive as you say, if she doesn't need aunt to do pickups any more. If OP can stand on her own with parenting duties, then she should be more firm. If she needs aunt in the future, it's a tough choice she may have to make about tolerating aunt's snide comments and boundary stepping.", "YTA.  You admit that although she is polite to you,  there is something off about her.\n\nSHE'S TRYING TO STEAL YOUR CHILDREN. \n\nFFS. You even called and asked her for permission to pick up your own kids. What is wrong with you?", "NTA all you did was say you'd pick up **your own** kids. she seems to have boundary issues and that is not good. if she's off having a funk it's all on her.", "NTA. In the end they are your kids and you make the decision.", "NTA", "Ann is a boundary stomper who sulks when she doesn't get her own way. \n\nNTA they are your kids. Trust your instincts.", "My husband was very defensive of his aunt the first times I said something, but then after talking some times he has started to agree with me. However, his idea was to keep compromising (like, ok today mom goes to pick up children but you can go tomorrow\u2026) but I didn\u2019t want to have this talk every day so I made \u201cthe phone call\u201d", "Agree on everything. Anyway. A lot of comments mention I have been too passive. True, but I\u2019m the only one who ever said something. My husband and my MIL almost never say something in disagreement with her, even on trivial things. I have found myself into this family and\u2026 well I wasn\u2019t expecting these dynamics. My family is not perfect but it doesn\u2019t have this drama. I guess I took some time to learn but hopefully o will move in the right direction", "Please freaking stop 'keeping the peace'!!!!!!\n\nYou are in this situation because no one wanted the 'cool' <read CREEPY> aunt to feel anything other than happy about the situation.  These are YOUR kids.  NOT hers.  \n\nShe has ZERO legal standing and if something happens to the kids and you don't know where they are...............  Time to remind husband of the implications of 'dear aunty' running off to unknown places with his children. \n\nNTA.  But barely because you've coddled the situation way too much.  It's long past time she KNEW this and accepted it as LAW.", "No, I am being polite because I don\u2019t like treating people badly.\nWhen my work schedule changes again if she\u2019s not available we will deal with it. I don\u2019t need her for my schedule, she was never intended to be the main person for pick-up anyway.", "Being polite is ok.  Being so passive that aunt thinks it\u2019s ok to just pick up your kids and take them anywhere without your consent is another.  NTA but please be assertive when dealing with someone that stomps on your boundaries.  When it\u2019s time for MiL to start picking up the kids again, make sure it\u2019s the MIL.  She deserves time with the kids? Aunt is stepping on her too?", "Yes of course. I left some info out from the original post because it didn\u2019t fit in 3000 chars. \nAunt would call MIL and say she was picking up kids that day. MIL would say ok because nobody said something different from ok to her.\nI was the last to know this since I stop working later than my husband (when I was doing full hours). When I arrived everybody was already home. So this has been going on for some time when i realised she was the one doing the pickup. I confronted my husband about this and his first reaction was that he didn\u2019t care who took the kids as long as someone took care of them. Then after some times he admitted he preferred that they spent time with his mother but said we couldn\u2019t do anything about this. Again, this is because nobody ever says anything to the aunt.", "NTA. Ann is coming off unhinged and obsessed with your children. For her to be angry that you now have more time to spend with your own children is nuts. You let this go on for too long and now she feels entitled. Going forward you need distance from her.", "NTA, she's overstepped constantly! Let her pout and hold this boundary even if you go back to work at normal hours.", "Sounds like Ann wants OP out of the picture so she can raise the kids."]}
