So, buckle up, it's a bit of a ride.\r I work in a small design firm, and there's this colleague, Mike (30M), who consistently takes credit for my ideas. It's not just a one-time thing; it's become a pattern. Picture this: brainstorming sessions where I throw out an idea, and suddenly, it's Mike's \"innovation\" when the boss praises it. Frustrating, right?\r Now, I'm all about teamwork and collaboration, but this has crossed the line. It's affecting my professional growth, and frankly, it's annoying as heck.\r Fast forward to a few weeks ago, and I stumbled upon a fantastic opportunity to network with industry leaders at a conference. The catch? I have some valuable contacts that I've built relationships with over the years, and I know they could benefit our projects.\r Here's where the dilemma kicks in. Mike heard about the conference and straight-up asked for my contacts, claiming it's for the \"good of the team.\" Now, I'm no stranger to the concept of sharing, but considering his track record of taking credit for my ideas, I hesitated.\r Instead of handing over my contacts on a silver platter, I took a different approach. I decided to be discreet about the event details and kept my contacts to myself, attending the conference solo.\r Lo and behold, my strategy paid off. I made some impressive connections, and our firm is now on the radar of some influential players in the industry. Projects are rolling in, and everyone's happy.\r Now, Mike is furious. He found out about the conference, realized I didn't share my contacts, and accused me of being selfish.
