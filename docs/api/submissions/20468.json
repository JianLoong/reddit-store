It's only the start of this year, as our nursery fees reduced, we've been able to save \u00a3600 a month and have \u00a3200-300 disposable income each, each month.

This is from her disposable income which she can do whatever with. Similar to how I might spend it on a PS5 one month (though this is obviously not each month). Turns out her friend isn't claiming unemployment benefit which is likely to be more than my wife gives her. I mentioned us to her that she should claim it but she doesn't want to claim benefits out of principle. \n\nAITA? \n\nI told my wife that she shouldn't be giving her friend so much money a month if she's not claiming unemployment benefit. We are fortunately in a position to be saving \u00a3600 a month and at the same time my wife giving a lot to her friend, but there's better stuff that money can be spent on if it's not a necessity to give it to her friend.

How about she finds a job?? \n\nYour wife's priorities are not in the corect order, and her friend is a leach", "NTA\n\nYou are married, which means shared finances. It may be her spending money, but this situation is ridiculous.\n\nYou cannot claim you won't file for unemployment on principle but then be willing to take significant money from a friend that isn't wealthy. \n\nIt's okay for her to love and support her friend, but you didn't sign up to care for another human being.", "NTA\n\nSo this \u201cfriend\u201d won\u2019t take government benefits out of principle but is more than happy to take money off her friend with by the sounds of it no plans to pay it back?\n\nYour wife is being used and whilst this woman\u2019s situation is unfortunate it\u2019s not your wife\u2019s job to save her\n\nAsk your wife would this person do the same for her in the same situation? I\u2019m guessing not\n\nHopefully she\u2019ll see what you\u2019re saying because whilst she has a right to use some money on herself it\u2019s not fair that the greed of others are taking away her own enjoyments in life", "NTA\n\n\"I won't take government aid out of pride, but I'll gladly burden my friend with a disabled kid!\"\n\n\n-A person with principle\n\n\n\ud83d\ude02", "NTA but your wife\u2019s friend????

Nope.", "NTA\n\nYou say the friend won't file for unemployment \"on principle\". I'm in the US, and here each paycheck has a percentage withdrawn for unemployment insurance. In other words, a premium. \n\nNow the friend is unemployed, so she needs to use the unemployment. If she needed to go to a doctor, for which she pays a health insurance premium, would she refuse \"on principle\"? Because it's the same thing. THE SAME THING. You pay the premium in case you ever need the insurance to pay for something. It's not \"free money\" or \"welfare\". It's INSURANCE, and the friend needs to use it. \n\nYour wife needs to understand that same thing. She should not be subsidizing her friend's ignorance.", "NTA this is crazy...your wife is handing over 400 quid a month to her friend!?! \n\nShe can claim UC...how do you know she isn't already claiming UC as well as taking money from your wife\n\nShe must be hell of a friend to be worth \u00a3400 a month\n\nI bet anything that if you asked for it to be paid back...the friend will disappear \n\nNow I'm only speaking for myself here...but if my partner was giving away \u00a3400 a month when we've kids to feed and bills to pay...to some friend who is happy to grab every penny out of you...I'll be out the door", "NTA - the right of this country has a lot to answer for. The whole benefit scrounger narrative that permeated our papers and news media over the last twenty years has meant that people feel ashamed to claim what they are entitled to. Your scenario is just a knock-on of that. \nI think that this is a matter to be dealt with sensitively, money is always hard to talk about, but someone does need to sit with your wife\u2019s friend and help them through this in terms of getting what they are entitled to. Just sending money to someone is often actually not the kindest thing you can do.", "If you and she share finances, then NTA. Itnis one thing for each person to use their money as they see fit. It is another thing to make a major financial outlay every month.

Yes, it is her money but she is not making responsible decisions here.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Does your wife's friend know that by not applying for benefits she's losing out on NI contributions? Can affect future state pension. Being on benefits when unemployed ensures that the contributions are made (or absence of contributions doesn't occur; not sure of the mechanics of it). Might be worth your wife telling her this.", "NTA... I love how principled her friend is. She wont use benefits that taxes are paid to provide for people in need, but she will take money repeatedly from a friend. \nI wouldnt be good with this either.", "ESH\n\nIt sounds like you both have wonky priorities ($300 art and assisting a lazy friend while you have roof issues!). \n\nI think the two of you should sit down with paper & pen, and come up with a list of combined priorities & a household budget that allocates every dollar for the next month.

It's nice to help a friend. I would want my friend to help me similarly. Your opinion is also valid, you have your own financial obligations as a couple.", "YTA. From what you described that money is her personal spending money, same as your PS5 money. All the repairs, bills, etc is a red herring. You have no say over how she spends that money and vice versa. \nIf you need to revisit how you two budget that's one thing.

When you receive unemployment you are just getting back your money no reason to feel bad collecting it, it's like taking money out of a savings account. \nIf she feels that bad getting money from the government she definitely should also feel bad taking money from your wife. I do think that she isn't eligible for unemployment and is using pride as an excuse. She may have been fired for doing something she wasn't supposed to do. If that's not the case cut her off and when she's hungry she will quickly swallow that pride and take money from the government. \nI was laid off once, had absolutely no issues collecting unemployment till I found a new job.

Seriously.", "It is there to use it for what you want. I didn't mention the detail above, but one of the reasons it annoys me, other than the principle of it, is that when my wife runs out of money to spend on her self, she takes money from the children's savings or other savings. If we go over our joint shopping budget, all other grocery shopping comes from my account or goes on the credit card. I wanted to take the kids to an event in London.

She\u2019s entitled to benefit and if I got laid off tomorrow then I would be claiming benefits entitled to me before I took that sort of money from a friend. Especially knowing that she has a daughter who requires extra care and finance. This isn\u2019t a reflection on our systems or how hard people work to do their best for people in need. It\u2019s directed at friend who\u2019s taking \u00a3400+ instead of applying for support through the right channels. I know that there is still stigma attached to claiming benefits but sometimes we just don\u2019t have a choice. What would she do if OP\u2019s wife withdrew the financial support?", "That could be a while. Something that might help to illustrate the problem to your wife is if your mortgage fix is ending, take the number of years left on your mortgage, amount remaining, etc and then stick the numbers into a mortgage repayment calculator for a mortgage of 5% or 6%, because it's entirely possible mortgage rates will still be around that number next year. If your mortgage is like ours, what you're currently saving is likely not to be possible any more once your fix ends so it would be good to build up a cushion in the meantime.", "NTA. \n\nDoes your wife need a new friend?

UC doesn\u2019t cover anything but the bare minimum, Just googled and it\u2019s only \u00a3334 a month assuming over 25 and single.

Also, you've got a disabled child to care for--you should be building up savings in case something happens to one or both of you because the child will still need care!\n\nIt's also ridiculous that her friend refuses to claim unemployment benefits but is willing to take your money.\n\nIf your wife insists on handing her friend money, maybe the friend can work for it?  Like, help with the DIY fixes around the house?  Clean?  Yardwork?  Childcare so you two can have a date night?", "Does the wife know for sure her friend isn't getting benefits? The friend could be spinning a sob story.", "Wife thinks friend would do it for her.\n\nFriend tells wife she would fo it for her.\n\nIf wife ever needs to ask friend, friend will be soooo regretful, but, alas, right now her kid needs money.

She overspends. And she is ducking accountability because 'it is her personal budget'. I think instead of focussing on what she spends it on and deciding for her, have a conversation that her spending is not maintainable, and how she proposes to fix it so she stays within budget."]}
