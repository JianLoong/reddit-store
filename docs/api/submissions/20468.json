It's only the start of this year, as our nursery fees reduced, we've been able to save \u00a3600 a month and have \u00a3200-300 disposable income each, each month. For a long time we had more debt than savings (I lost my job for 9 months during the pandemic) and it's only this year this has turned the other way around. \n\nSituation \n\nWife's friend has lost her job and my wife is giving her between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400 a month. This is from her disposable income which she can do whatever with. Similar to how I might spend it on a PS5 one month (though this is obviously not each month). Turns out her friend isn't claiming unemployment benefit which is likely to be more than my wife gives her. I mentioned us to her that she should claim it but she doesn't want to claim benefits out of principle. \n\nAITA? \n\nI told my wife that she shouldn't be giving her friend so much money a month if she's not claiming unemployment benefit. We are fortunately in a position to be saving \u00a3600 a month and at the same time my wife giving a lot to her friend, but there's better stuff that money can be spent on if it's not a necessity to give it to her friend. For example, our house is falling apart on many places - issues with the roof, the whole bathroom needs replacing and all of upstairs need an entire refurbishment (loose floorboards, wallpaper falling of the walls etc.). \n\nWe're/I am doing these refurbishments slowly. I've just started doing the bedroom and spending more money than needed on fancy radiators and \u00a3300 art to go on the wall. If I'm spending money on that, surely she can spend similar on her friend on might say. \n\nThere's also the weekly cost for speech therapy for our child and the fact our mortgage is due for renewal next year and will go from 1.7% to god knows what. \n\nWe had an argument about it and my wife isn't budging. I wasn't even demanding anything, just saying it's something she shouldn't be doing.

I would understand her if it was a desperate situation, but her friend is not claiming money from the state because of her ego? Are you kidding me? How about she finds a job?? \n\nYour wife's priorities are not in the corect order, and her friend is a leach", "NTA\n\nYou are married, which means shared finances. It may be her spending money, but this situation is ridiculous.\n\nYou cannot claim you won't file for unemployment on principle but then be willing to take significant money from a friend that isn't wealthy. \n\nIt's okay for her to love and support her friend, but you didn't sign up to care for another human being.", "NTA\n\nSo this \u201cfriend\u201d won\u2019t take government benefits out of principle but is more than happy to take money off her friend with by the sounds of it no plans to pay it back?\n\nYour wife is being used and whilst this woman\u2019s situation is unfortunate it\u2019s not your wife\u2019s job to save her\n\nAsk your wife would this person do the same for her in the same situation? I\u2019m guessing not\n\nHopefully she\u2019ll see what you\u2019re saying because whilst she has a right to use some money on herself it\u2019s not fair that the greed of others are taking away her own enjoyments in life", "NTA\n\n\"I won't take government aid out of pride, but I'll gladly burden my friend with a disabled kid!\"\n\n\n-A person with principle\n\n\n\ud83d\ude02", "NTA but your wife\u2019s friend???? Yup, that would be the AH. Friend doesn\u2019t want to file for unemployment \u201con principle\u201d but is fine taking money from your wife.  No. Nada. Nope.", "NTA\n\nYou say the friend won't file for unemployment \"on principle\". I'm in the US, and here each paycheck has a percentage withdrawn for unemployment insurance. In other words, a premium. \n\nNow the friend is unemployed, so she needs to use the unemployment. If she needed to go to a doctor, for which she pays a health insurance premium, would she refuse \"on principle\"? Because it's the same thing. THE SAME THING. You pay the premium in case you ever need the insurance to pay for something. It's not \"free money\" or \"welfare\". It's INSURANCE, and the friend needs to use it. \n\nYour wife needs to understand that same thing. She should not be subsidizing her friend's ignorance.", "NTA this is crazy...your wife is handing over 400 quid a month to her friend!?! \n\nShe can claim UC...how do you know she isn't already claiming UC as well as taking money from your wife\n\nShe must be hell of a friend to be worth \u00a3400 a month\n\nI bet anything that if you asked for it to be paid back...the friend will disappear \n\nNow I'm only speaking for myself here...but if my partner was giving away \u00a3400 a month when we've kids to feed and bills to pay...to some friend who is happy to grab every penny out of you...I'll be out the door", "NTA - the right of this country has a lot to answer for. The whole benefit scrounged narrative that permeated our papers and news media over the last twenty years has meant that people feel ashamed to claim what they are entitled to. Your scenario is just a knock-on of that. \nI think that this is a matter to be dealt with sensitively, money is always hard to talk about, but someone does need to sit with your wife\u2019s friend and help them through this in terms of getting what they are entitled to. Just sending money to someone is often actually not the kindest thing you can do.", "If you and she share finances, then NTA. Itnis one thing for each person to use their money as they see fit. It is another thing to make a major financial outlay every month. That would not be cool for either of you to.do without consulting the other.", "Her friend needs to get over herself and claim unemployment money. Your wife needs to stop enabling her when she has her own family at home. This isn\u2019t a case of the friend not having any other viable options. Your wife is being take advantage of. Yes, it is her money but she is not making responsible decisions here.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Does your wife's friend know that by not applying for benefits she's losing out on NI contributions? Can affect future state pension. Being on benefits when unemployed ensures that the contributions are made (or absence of contributions doesn't occur; not sure of the mechanics of it). Might be worth your wife telling her this.", "NTA... I love how principled her friend is. She wont use benefits that taxes are paid to provide for people in need, but she will take money repeatedly from a friend. \nI wouldnt be good with this either.", "ESH\n\nIt sounds like you both have wonky priorities ($300 art and assisting a lazy friend while you have roof issues!). \n\nI think the two of you should sit down with paper & pen, and come up with a list of combined priorities & a household budget that allocates every dollar for the next month. Continue to do this every couple of weeks and get your house in order while keeping your kid at the top of the priority list.", "either she can do what she wants with her disposable money, OR it\u2019s something you can tell her that she shouldn\u2019t be doing. not both.\n\nso basically if this is ok within your relationship agreements and precedents, then it\u2019s ok for you to ask her to think about it, and it\u2019s not ok for you to TELL her she\u2019s wrong. \n\nif it were different, it\u2019d be different, but you can\u2019t have it both ways and that tension is likely what she\u2019s reacting to.\n\neta: yta as of right now, but you can still change that.", "NAH - it's okay for you to ask her to stop but it's her disposable income so she can do whatever she wants with it. It's nice to help a friend. I would want my friend to help me similarly. Your opinion is also valid, you have your own financial obligations as a couple.", "YTA. From what you described that money is her personal spending money, same as your PS5 money. All the repairs, bills, etc is a red herring. You have no say over how she spends that money and vice versa. \nIf you need to revisit how you two budget that's one thing. Criticizing how she spends her personal money when you two have already worked out that deal is an AH move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
