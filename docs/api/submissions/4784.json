My Aunt and Uncle are very clear about their distaste for Kal. They think that I can \u2018do better\u2019 because she\u2019s an artist and I\u2019m a lawyer. Guests were allowed to wear any clothes of their choosing, as long as they were pink. Kal and I were wearing black.\n\nI didn\u2019t think that it was a,problem, the outfit didn\u2019t have to be all pink but the main piece did. People messaged me saying that they had nothing to wear but I supplied them with clothing. \n\nMy Aunt and Uncle texted me 3 days before the wedding saying that they had nothing to wear, they said that they wanted to wear black, which I said no to for obvious reasons. \n\nKal bought a dress for my Aunt while my bridesmaid dyed a suit for my Uncle (which I love her for).\n\nThe day of our wedding my Aunt ripped the side of her dress, it was intentional because it ripped along a slit in the fabric and not the seam a few inches to the right, as it would if it was too tight. I sewed it together while I was getting my hair done, she wasn\u2019t pleased.\n\nNext, my Uncle threw a fit about wearing pink, he said that he looked like a \\*slur\\* and made a scene in front of staff. \n\nDuring the vows, my Aunt spilt red wine all over their clothes, I don\u2018t know why she was pouring wine, everyone was told to pause. They loudly called staff to clean it up and walked across the stage even though there was a bathroom on the other side too.\n\nAfter, my Uncle started talking to my family about how I was a bridezilla for the dress code, a few of the boys agreed with him and said I was trying to \u2018feminise\u2018 them. I was surprised as none of them had said anything to me earlier.\n\nI don\u2018t enjoy confrontation but Kal doesn\u2019t mind it. She talked to my Aunt and Uncle about their behaviour and highlighted how accommodating we were being. They basically said that she would never be a part of the family. I got angry and yelled at them for ruining our day and not behaving civilly towards my wife. \n\nThe next day, I was bombarded with messages calling me a bridezilla for yelling at my Aunt and Uncle and the dress code. They said that the pink was excessive and I could\u2019ve just put a ban on the colours black and white instead. I guess that we could\u2018ve but I didn\u2019t get any complaints so I thought it was fine. \n\nMy Dad\u2019s side of the family is on my Aunt and Uncles side because most of them wanted to wear red for some weird reason that I can\u2019t comprehend. I didn\u2019t know that so many people didn\u2019t like the colour scheme and my Grandma said that I was self-centred for not noticing the complaints. I do tend to get hyper-focused on tasks at hand so it is possible that I ignored some people\u2019s words. However, I looked through my phone and there were no messages about pink aside from people that had nothing to wear.  \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671100724, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmi2hn/aita_for_making_my_wedding_guests_wear_pink/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously your relatives are gigantic, bigoted, self-centered AHs who were against this for all the wrong reasons, so they get the brunt of the blame.\n\nBut it\u2019s a little odd to have such a rigid dress code, especially when it involves a polarizing colour. One of the many reasons people love weddings (apart from the love, togetherness, food, dancing, etc.) is because it gives them a chance to dress up and feel great about the way they look. To wear that flattering, pricy outfit from the back of the closet and, tastefully of course, show off a little. \n\nThere could be many reasons people don\u2019t want to wear pink that don\u2019t involve bigoted or needlessly gendered views. \n\nThere are lots of different shades of pink, but some people simply don\u2019t look good in it. Maybe it highlights their acne or rosacea. Maybe it just fights with their undertones. But self-conscious people don\u2019t often have good times.\n\nThere\u2019s also the frustration of having to shop for something new. It can be time-consuming, stressful and expensive, and depending on what\u2019s trending at the time, difficult. The last time I went to a wedding I had to try on practically every dress at the mall, and my self-esteem was in the toilet by the end. I know you feel like you bypassed the shopping experience by offering clothes, but if I feel like dirt in most dresses when I have free choice, there\u2019s zero chance I\u2019ll feel good in a gifted dress with such limited criteria.\n\nAlso, some people just feel silly having to follow a theme. One person\u2019s fun, playful bonding experience is another person\u2019s nightmare. \n\nSo the solution would be that if you don\u2019t want to adhere, you don\u2019t have to come. But then you miss seeing family and friends, you miss celebrating the happy couple, and you either have to lie, or admit to people that this was your hill to die on and be judged. \n\nI\u2019d be mortified if I were faced with a dress code like this. But I also wouldn\u2019t make a fuss because at the end of the day I have the self-awareness to know it isn\u2019t about me. Your relatives didn\u2019t have that.", "NTA. It is your day, your party, and if they hated the dress code this much, they should've stayed home rather than behave like children and disrupting your wedding because they were wearing a color they didn't like.\n\nI agree with Kal, you two were very accommodating.", "Sorry, but YTA. A bride has no right to dictate attire for anyone but her wedding party. The groom chooses for his guys. The readers, moms and dads and guests choose their own outfits. A bride who does this must accept that she may/will lose some guests becsuse of this.\n\nThis demand often forces other people to buy new attire they\u2019ll never wear again and/or outright despise. (I like pink, but some women absolutely hate it).  You tried to accommodate your aunt and uncle - but did you fo that for everybody, or just them?  If so, it was very unfair to your other guests.\n\nOn a practical level - this is one of those things that sounds cool but isn\u2019t.  All your pics will look the same\u2026.,Pepto Bismol people everywhere, like Parade of the Clones. \n\nLast - I posted about this a few months ago. My friend wants her guests to wear white. I\u2019d already declined being her bridesmaid because we\u2019re disabled and can\u2019t afford a bridesmaid\u2019s dress, share of a shower and bachelorette on top of a wedding gift.  Then she pulled the All White gig.  We can\u2019t afford a white dress, white suit and new shoes, and the only all-white evening dresses I can find in consignment or goodwill ARE wedding dresses. So we had to decline her invitation and she stilll isn\u2019t speaking to us.  \n\nSorry, but you\u2019re the asshole here for putting colors and photos over the feelings of the folks you care about.", "NTA because you actually supplied the clothing so it's not like they couldn't afford a pink outfit and had to sell their TV's to buy one.\n\nI've heard of people asking all their guests to wear white and then they wear something colourful, isn't this the same kind of thing?", "NTA.

Your aunt and uncle are bigots and were looking for any excuse not to attend your wedding.

I guess they didn't think you would do the opposite and accommodate them as much as you could. \n\nYour aunt even ripped the dress, maybe hoping it would mean she could duck out of the wedding. I bet she didn't expect you to repair it. And then she destroyed their clothing to show her disapproval.

It\u2019s her wedding if she wants that that\u2019s what she should get point blank period .", "There's some flexibility in wearing something colorful. You're not restricting people. Clothing is a form of expression, so if you restrict someone's choice of clothing, you'll likely put them in an uncomfortable situation. If someone really dislikes pink (I, for instance, don't like wearing green), you really are making them uncomfortable.\n\nHowever, I will give you this, the issue for men and pink it's a lot of homophobia and absurd stereotypes, which could have been an issue here.\n\nI saw OP commented that it didn't have to be a whole suit, but a shirt or an elaborate tie, but on the post it said that the principal piece had to be pink, so which one is it? Suppose it could have been just some piece. It's still odd, since I think most people do have something pink to wear, and you can always get a cheap pink tie or scarf. But also, if that was the case, why dye a suit pink? A shirt, ok, seems reasonable. But a whole suit? It's a bit passive aggressive and condescending. Honestly, if it were me, I would have just made an excuse to not go to this wedding.", "I suppose, I\u2019m just sorry for not thinking of it sooner. I mean, they could wear other colours, pink just had to be their \u2018statement\u2019. Like an elaborate pink tie. One of my cousins came in a full Mina cosplay from MHA, it was amazing!", "But it DOES mean folks had to soend money on an outfit they hate and will definitely never ever wear again. Doesn\u2019t say if they supplied attire in the color for ALL the guests who didn\u2019t have pink clothing or just her relatives. \n\nIt\u2019s a rude control freak way to treat your FRIENDS - especially when they are not even in the wedding party!", "It\u2019s not common but pink has a special place in my family because my last name combined with my Wife\u2019s last name translates to pink beauty. I\u2018m not entirely sure about the rules behind wearing pink, I thought that everyone could wear it, maybe I\u2019m just dense though. I\u2019m just surprised that people objected on the day instead of when the invitations came out, it was such a simple issue that could be fixed very easily. WelL, the dress code wasn\u2019t full pink. My brother came in a white suit with a pink shirt, it was fine because the statement piece was the shirt.", "Oh no, I probably should have clarified this. It\u2019s not only pink clothes, just clothes with a pink STATEMENT piece. Like a suit with pink shirt/tie, a dress with a pink corset/belt nor even just a pink shawl thrown on a white dress. We supplied clothes for quite a few people, we could afford it as there were less than 100 people at the wedding, As for the aesthetic issue, I\u2019m not sure. It is just for one night though (and there were no kids at the wedding).", "You wouldn\u2019t need a whole new outfit just a pink tie, cardigan/shawl or hat. It was no black outfits and with a pink statement piece not dress in all pink.", "Well, not a whole new outfit. There were options, like a white suit with a pink tie/shirt, or a dress with a blink corset/belt.", "Did they though? Pink suits don't really exist.  OP mentioned her bridesmaid dying a suit pink for her uncle, and she loved her for that.  Makes it seem like that was a one off, over the top effort.  If I was required to wear a pink suit to a wedding, I simply wouldn't be able to attend. Custom suits are expensive enough as is, let alone from the kind of tailor who would stock pink fabric.", "I\u2019d rather not go to a wedding than have a controlling couple supply my clothing.", "So what? Telling other people what colours to wear is unreasonable and controlling.", "You mentioned providing clothing to a few close relatives who complained. What about all of your other guests? Regardless, yes, I think it\u2019s tacky to micromanage your guests\u2019 clothing to this extent.", "\u201cSupplied clothing\u201d where did you get the clothing? \n\nEven then, I love pink, but I know I am in the minority. Asking everyone to wear pink? That\u2019s a little outrageous.", "Some people just don't like to wear pink, or it doesn't suit them. YTA here.", "Why did the uncle need his suit dyed then? That\u2019s a little confusing.", "Yes, it was a bit much. \n\nDoes it rise to the level of justifying their behavior?  No.  But I'd be side eyeing this request myself.", "> Was it a bit much?\n\nIt's **a lot**. I wouldn't even say it's a bit much. It's a lot to expect to define the dress code for normal attendees down to the color.\n\nAs most other people note, you aunt and uncle reacted like shit and seem to be people with morally abhorrent values - but you're asking a lot of your guests. Personally, I'd just decline to go most likely. I wouldn't be willing to wear supplied clothes.", "Let me say that your aunt and uncle were extraordinarily rude and any sort of a slur is awful and uncalled for. \n\nBy US and Western European standards it\u2019s a bit much to request guests wear a certain color but if a second ceremony in India is more of a party, then there are definitely parties with a color theme. Perhaps others wanted to wear red since that\u2019s a color they may have already had in their wardrobes. \n\nIt was lovely that your wife and bridesmaid found a solution and went to that effort for your aunt and uncle. It seems like maybe letting them just wear something other than black or white might have been a good compromise or just letting them stay home. \n\nNTA, even if the request was over the top.", "So is declining to go.", "Yeah but stopping people wearing any black cuts out a lot of options for a lot of people. \n\nI think putting the two together was a bit much. Either have a main colour you ask people to wear something of as part of their outfit (a pink tie is okay IMO, getting people to wear pink suits is an *ask*) or ask them not to wear a colour. Doing both, when black is a wardrobe staple for a lot of people and pink isn't so much, was a step too far.", "Oh no, the entire outfit didn\u2019t have to be pink, just the statement item. Many people came in a white suit and pink shirt, or just an elaborate pink tie.", "Yes! This is terrible for the environment! So selfish to make everyone buy clothes they don\u2019t like and won\u2019t rewear just for pictures.", "It makes sense that pink means something to you. But... Why didn't you wear pink if it's so important? Or the bridal party? Or just your immediate family? Dictating that all your guests wear a specific color was over the top.  It's like they're props or background sets to make your pictures look a certain way.  Though your aunt and uncle were behaving terribly. They should have just not attended.", "I\u2019ve been thinking how I would react here. In the 80s we all had our \u201cseasons\u201d done, it was a hugely popular thing where you were told what colors you should avoid because they don\u2019t look good with your skin tone. I remember that pink/yellow/any lighter red tones were my \u201cforbidden\u201dcolors and it\u2019s been 40 years and I still won\u2019t wear those colors. I\u2019ve also been raised \u201cif you can\u2019t say anything nice, don\u2019t say anything\u201d- so I probably would have shut up and worn pink but hated it and resented you a little for making me choose between your wedding & looking washed out/staying home. \nBut don\u2019t you think this is probably all just mostly their own bigotry and they\u2019re using the color as a shield?", "Why not tell people about the special meaning and \u2018invite\u2019 people to wear pink rather than requiring it?", "Ah Ok that\u2019s not so bad then. My husband actually has a pink tie and I would probably then go pink shoes and clutch or something. Cheapish bits.", "I declined a dear friend\u2019s invitation for this reason. We\u2019re disabled and can\u2019t afford a new white dress, white suit and 2 pairs of shoes we\u2019ll never wear again.  Renting a suit is $75, and the only all-white evening gowns I can find in consignment or Goodwiill ARE wedding dresses.  She called me a \u201cshitty friend\u201d (quote) because she thinks everybody has time to save up for new clothes for her wedding.  Her mom and sister both called us to apologize. \n\nBrides - PLEASE don\u2019t do this to your guests for photos. If you do, be sensible and kind enough to understand that some folks can\u2019t afford it and don\u2019t get your panties in a wad when they can\u2019t come.", "Okay, only close friends and family came to the wedding (COVID) so we did provide clothing for all that asked.", "We either made it, thrifted it or bought it from the store? I don\u2019t understand what you mean. I understand that asking everyone to wear pink is a littLe outrageous, but my Wife was dead set on the idea and I wasn\u2019t going to deny her that one little thing. I didn\u2019t really see the harm in it.", "The Uncle said he didn\u2019t have anything pink, So OP got him something pink. It could have been a tie but OP decided to put in extra effort. He might also have said he didn\u2019t have a non black suit in which case dying a suit would make more sense too.", "declining is also an option, as long as you waer pink while declining", "At a wedding it is not too far to request people not wear what the bide and groom does equally whilst black may be a general wardrobe staple for formal wear anyone wearing a dress already generally shouldn\u2019t be wearing black to a wedding and for anyone who isn\u2019t it would just mean wearing another staple like blue/light grey instead with a pink tie (which based of OP\u2019s other comments the dresscode isn\u2019t that stringent formality wise so you wouldn\u2019t even need a jacket)\n\nHonestly it\u2019s a pretty simple ask to achieve", "Oh, ok. That's far more doable then.", "When a family member gets married, you typically have engagement parties, bridal showers and the wedding and you are expected to buy presents for all of these events. If you ask me to buy clothing that my husband are gonna wear not gonna again also, suddenly I\u2019m busy the weekend of your wedding.", "Well, my Wife wanted us to wear black. They all did wear a specific colour, perhaps that was over-the-top. I just didn\u2019t think that it would be a problem considering that others in my family have had worse dress codes. My cousin only allowed one cut of dress and nobody really said anything. Then again, maybe colour is a bigger deal for people?", "Unless I'm in the wedding party, I'm not coming to your wedding wearing something I don't already own.", "But it's possible some didn't have pink clothing and didn't ask so as to not be an inconvenience, but still felt uncomfortable. Only until they found out that they weren't the only ones that they also voiced their complains.\n\nAnyhow, you can restrict some colors within reason. But making people wear such an uncommon color as pink makes them feel more like a prop and less like a guest. It's a bit demeaning.\n\nAlso, clothing choices are a form of expression. People dress the wey they do because that is how they feel comfortable. Of course, you can ask for some etiquette, like night gowns for women and dark colors for men, and so they are allowed some flexibility. But here's the thing: the fact that pink suits are not as widespread is because most men don't like wearing a pink suit. Why would the stores sell them if nobody likes them? So in a sense, you did technically asked guests to be uncomfortable at your wedding. Again, they are guests, not props.\n\nYTA.", "[removed]", "Well when I go to a wedding, I want to look good and go shopping for clothes that will fit me.

You can control the venue and the flowers but to take it to all of your guests?? Making your uncle wear a pink suit?? I wouldn\u2019t do that to my dad ever ever. Why make a ton of people uncomfortable for this \u201clittle\u201d thing. Although I don\u2019t think making all the guest wear one colour is \u201clittle\u201d", "They dyed a suit pink. They wanted pink as the main colour.\n\nIf OP had said just a tie was okay I'd agree with you, but they dyed a suit pink for someone who didn't want to wear the colour.\n\nIt's overkill, and at least 4 women I can think of had a partly/mostly black dress at my wedding so I'm not sure where you got that dresses shouldn't be black from", "Just to make sure I'm understanding right... your cousin only allowed all of her guest's to wear one style of dress??? Guests not bridal party?? Maybe these are some cultural differences here but that seems like crazy bridezilla to me.  I just don't get the purpose behind dictating what your guests wear.
