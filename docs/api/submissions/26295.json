She has been loved and dotted on for every accomplishment and birthday.\r  \n\r  \nI, on the other hand, have not. I am one of a flock of children. Last I checked I'm one of twenty; however, I was kicked out as a teen because I came out as a lesbian and wanting to go to college. Birthdays of mine were never really celebrated or acknowledged.\r  \n And this is why I am TERRIBLE at receiving gifts.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward to now: I have several degrees, I am very well off with a thriving career, I bought this beautiful estate in a major city for my fianc\u00e9 and I, and I am just now starting to love being spoiled with gifts and attention after many years of therapy.\r  \n\r  \nWe have been in couple's therapy for the past year leading up to our wedding to make sure we have a strong base for marriage and our communication is healthy. \r  \n\r  \nLast night, my fianc\u00e9 gave me my birthday gift and it was a porcelain travel mug with a very big box of fancy tea. It honestly felt like something you'd give to an aunt you don't know very well, but you know they like tea so you ride with that. This is also the exact same gift I have been given to me before. She also is having her parents in town for my entire birthday week, who dislike me for \"making\" their daughter a lesbian and are just now getting past that after us being together for five years. They are going to be here this evening for my actual birthday and requested we go out for dinner, but with the stipulation it not be a vegan place because \"they want options too\" even though we are vegan and that means I am not going to get exactly the kind of food I would hope for.\r  \n\r  \nMy friend had given me the gift of brunch and a thrift shopping spree and I had been excited and given her a hug. My fianc\u00e9 piped in to ask why I wasn't this enthusiastic when she gave me her gift and I said, \"Honestly, it didn't feel like a very thoughtful gift, it felt like the kind your dad would get your mother.\"\r  \n\r  \nFor context: Every year her dad gets her mom a piece of jewelry and takes her out to dinner for her birthday and does the same for their anniversary. It really bothers my fianc\u00e9 because she knows her mother doesn't like it or feels special and wishes her mom would just tell her dad that. But her mom knows it would only hurt his ego and doesn't think it is worth mentioning.\r  \n\r  \nI figure since this is something we've talked about it would be a very fast way to clue her in on the gift and the feeling I am having. I sincerely am not concerned about the amount of money she spends, only the effort.\r  \n\r  \nMy fianc\u00e9 unleashes a wave of angry tears. She couldn't believe I compared her to her father as he hasn't always been the best, so I did apologize for saying that. The whole night turned into me consoling her and affirming I love her.\r  \n\r", "created_utc": 1693950540, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16b1duc/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9_that_her_gift_was_as/", "score": 206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not about the gift. It's about her making the least possible effort for your birthday. I'm assuming she knows that this is a sore spot for you. Inviting her parents when they've clearly been less than warm to you in the past is plain rude. The gift sounds really impersonal and not something you give your fiance. I suppose even a handwritten letter or a small, thoughtful present would have been much better. Anything to show that she knows you and is thinking about you and wants to make you feel special. I completely understand why you feel this way and this is coming from someone who does not care about birthdays at all. I think you calling her out rightfully really struck a nerve. As it should.", "NTA.  She gave a super generic gift and then wanted a big reaction?   Does she know you at all?  Your explanation was very concise, and communicated exactly what the problem was, no room to brush it off or misinterpret what was said.  Yes, she found the truth upsetting, but that doesn\u2019t make it not the truth.  If she wants a bigger reaction to her gift, she needs to put in bigger effort/thought/shits given.", "NTA. Like another commenter said, inviting her parents which clearly didnt like you is just rude. Plus, the fact you automatically knew you have received the gift before says a lot about your fiance.", "NTA and I'm so surprised and honestly saddened by those saying otherwise.\n\nThat tea set is something I would have at the back of my closet in my generic gift pile of items that could be given to a co-worker or neighbour with minimal effort, not for someone that I love dearly especially if they had been always neglected in this way.\n\nAnd it's bad enough that your STB-inlaws  were invited to dinner,  making what should be an enjoyable, relaxing possibly romantic birthday dinner stressful and possibly filled with anxiety and awkwardness & it wasn't a restaurant you enjoy.\n\nAnd the icing on your birthday cake is that it's not just a shared meal But they're staying for a whole week....A Whole Week. \n\nIt sounds like a celebration for your fianc\u00e9e and her parents not for you. \n\nIs your fianc\u00e9e usually this selfish? And is her family always so disrespectful?", "NTA but I\u2019m curious if she genuinely knows your interests. This seems like one of those wealthy people equating a good gift with the amount spent on it vs choosing something that someone would actually want. Also it is your birthday week, her parents do not need to come during that. I also think that if they won\u2019t go somewhere you want to go for dinner then why even bother going out to dinner with them. You need to have deeper discussions with your fianc\u00e9 when it comes to her parents. Now if you\u2019re just planning to use them for funds I would put up with some irritation but if you\u2019re not getting anything out of dealing with them why waste a good birthday being miserable.", "NTA. She asked. You answered.", "I don't know if this makes you TA, but I think you could have said it a little differently. I hope in couples therapy y'all will be able to talk this through. Whether or not you meant it to be a dig, it does seem like you would know this would hurt your partner given how upset it makes her. I think using some skills from therapy could have been beneficial to express your thoughts around the gift, and maybe she'd come to the conclusion herself that it was similar to her mom and dad situation.", "NTA that\u2019s literally a terrible gift. Tea???? Is she serious???????", "If you don't want to get compared to a shitty thoughtless gift giver, then maybe don't be a shitty thoughtless gift giver?\n\nNTA. Shit at least the mother can sell all the jewellery and get other stuff. Who the fuck is going to buy a travel mug off you and if they did, what other gift are you going to get yourself for $1?\n\nTHen forcing you to deal with parents on your birthday who don't like you and will whine like children if they are forced to go to a restaurant the birthday girl wants to go to... you know the absolutely standard thing the entire world agreed was the polite thing for everyone to agree to do.\n\nShe's behaving exactly like her father and getting you used to having shitty birthdays so you never expect anything special or any extra effort. Do you want a partner who spends a life time being thoughtless and getting upset if you point it out, at what point will you just stop expecting anything and stop caring if she doesn't try to make things special for you?", "NTA, but some people are just really bad at gift-giving. I adore my husband and frequently bring him home trinkets, but every time I have to buy him an actual gift, my mind goes completely blank. We have everything we need. \n\nMaybe offer to make an Amazon wish list for next time?", "NTA. \n\nI'm getting a guy I've been dating for a month, a more thoughtful gift. Also inviting parents over OP's birthday week could be a trying to make things better and make the family focus in and accept OP. But this should not have been done without OP's express knowledge and interest in the idea. \n\nFor those saying she shouldn't have mentioned it in front of the friend.  Well, 2 things. She asked in front of the friend, and Unless one of them clued the friend in to the gifts her dad gets her mom, then it was a pretty, tactful way to say what needed said.", "Unless you're into tea, it WAS a bad gift, especially coming from a partner of 5 years.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  A crappy, thoughtless gift and MIL visit on your birthday???  What???   Did she run the visit by you???  And dinner at a non vegan place.  Ugh.  Very thoughtless and kinda spiteful?", ">so I did apologize for saying that. The whole night turned into me consoling her and affirming I love her.\n\nIf I understand the term correctly, this is a classic case of DARVO: Deny, Accuse, Reverse Victim & Offender.  \n\n\nShe hurt you and you ended apologizing. Classic case.  \n\n\nNTA.", "Wow. What a waste of therapy. \ud83e\udd23", "Info: what are the kind of gifts you give her? Are they thoughtful and unique? Or are they also run of the mill? \n\nHmmm ESH\nI think this whole issue is pretty minor.\n\nI do think she could have put in more effort, but instead embarrassing her in front of your friend, you should have discussed it with her privately.\n\nIn the future maybe give her specific ideas and be clear about what you want.", "NAH. You were being honest; insensitive, but honest. She is justified in her emotional reaction. You're getting married, so these are the types of things you work through.", "NTA but you should really rethink the engagement.", "I honestly don\u2019t think YTA. Specifically because your conversation about her parents. She got mad at you for doing what she would advise he mother to do, how can she get angry at that? After 5 years and therapy you would think she would have a better idea of what you would enjoy on your birthday. She failed on two counts, first with what felt like a thoughtless gift, then by subjecting you to her parents. Double fail. I honestly think you made your point very politely and she\u2019s reacting like a child to it. There was absolutely no need for tears during that interaction. In the end I would say she gaslit you. It was no longer about how your birthday was slightly disappointing but about how you had the audacity to say she was anything like a man who raised her.", "Question: You state \"This is also the exact same gift I have been given to me before.\"\n\nWho gave you that gift? DO you like travel mugs and tea?\n\nNow if it was just a generic travel mug and tea set, yeah, I'd be a little disappointed, I mean... that's the type of generic low-effort mass-produced gift I might give my coworkers for the Holidays.\n\nBut if it was a mug with a design by an artist you favor, support for a cause near to your heart, favorite colors/design/place/characters etc....and a selection of teas that you like or have mentioned wanting to try (assuming you are a tea drinker)....then that's more thought than \"Ah! Here's a mug a tea package from Republic of Tea catalogue. I'll just ger her that.\"\n\nI totally get your feelings about the gift. If it was just a catalog order box set, that's a meh gift from someone who's supposed to be close to you. But, YTA only for the reason that you are always supposed to be gracious when you get a gift, no matter how much you dislike or are disappointed in it, and how you responded to her.", "YTA\n\nSo your fiancee got you a gift that 1) is nice 2) is practical 3) is related to your interests or daily habits. But that's not good enough?\n\nNot every gift is going to be phenomenal, or super personal. And not every gift is going to be experiential, like what your friend did. You need to be able to be gracious even when things aren't fantastic. Also, overall this reads like you're taking your anger about the in-laws visit out on your partner via this criticism. Their visit is totally unrelated to the gift and shouldn't have been relevant to your response.", "yta for assuming the worst \n\nin your partner\u2019s head, do you think this was some low-effort gift that was akin to her just checking a box and doing the bare minimum? I dont think that\u2019s the case, but that\u2019s how you reacted", "YTA. I mean birthday week? Yes the gift want very thoughtful, but also not problematic? You want everyone to go to a vegan restaurant because you are vegan?\n\nYou are not 8 years old - grow up", "YTA - you\u2019re 32 years old. Your tough childhood doesn\u2019t justify your demand to be spoiled on your birthday or making your fianc\u00e9 feel bad about the gift she got you. You\u2019re ungrateful, and she would be justified in getting you nothing next year.", "YTA.  How are you 32 years old and don't realize that \"You're doing something just like your parent that you have issues with!\" is a no-go?", "ESH.  You should not have had this fight in front of the friend who gifted you brunch. Your fianc\u00e9e needs to stand up to her parents and have your back with them. \n\n\nI am going to assume she\u2019s a lousy gift giver.  Have you ever seen her give a truly thoughtful gift?  To you or anyone?  If she is actually not great at gifts, that May be something she should work on if it\u2019s important to you.  You might bring this up in relationship counseling.", "YTA. You don't seem to have communicated any hints or desires regarding gifts, so I'll give your fianc\u00e9 the benefit of the doubt and assume she meant well. Your response was to subtly insult not just your fianc\u00e9 but her parents, too. Yikes.", "ESH. It sounds like she didn't put in much effort, but you hit awfully hard. You both need lots of talking about love language, time versus money, etc.", "Maybe unpopular, but YTA. \n\nOne thing I've learned is that some people just suck at giving gifts.   My best friend, is a great guy and would probably do almost anything for me.  His birthday gifts leave a lot to be desired lol.   And its something I've just come to understand. \n\nAnd the fact that you chose to compare it to a situation that you know she is sensitive about seems like you cared more about making your point than her feelings.   You knew what you were doing, which is why you apologized after and consoled her.  \n\nSometimes you will get shitty gifts from people.  The adult thing is to do is smile, nod, and pretend you like it.  If this is a common problem, then be proactive and make an amazon list of things you would like but don't want to buy for yourself.", "You had a rough childhood sorry, it\u2019s a defining aspect  in your personality sure, but it doesn\u2019t give you any right to demand or expect more from others. I don\u2019t know why this gift is such a a big deal if everything is so good in life now. Stop finding something to make into a struggle, enjoy how far you\u2019ve come YTA", "YTA Different people are good or bad at different things. I would take somebody who is not good at gifts, but is good at listening to my problems, or cooking for me, or takes care of all the vacation planning. Does this woman show she cares about you and shows she loves you in other ways?", "ESH\n Meaningful presents are important to you, and you've expressed that desire, so it sounds like your fiancee let you down in a big way. That's shitty.\n\nYou compared her to her dad, which seems like a soft spot for her, and you did it in public, in front of your friend. That's also shitty. \n\nAre they equally shitty? Yeah, in different ways.\n\nI don't love that your partner turned the whole night into being about their hurt, but I'd also be livid if my partner compared me to my dad like that.\n\nI suggest using this moment to reflect on both your behaviors and really work together to come to an understanding through open conversation. Don't repeat the same behaviors through your marriage. Fix it now.", "YTA - learn to be gracious.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Does her fianc\u00e9e not know her tastes or is she just frazzled by her parents being in town for a week? Could OP not ask her why the gift was given without comparing her to her father?", "I buy special tea, accessories for one friend and my sister who love tea but not for every occasion. Unfortunately I hate tea myself but my sister (who loves it) will gift it to me at least once a year. I always say thank you but am not enthusiastic and I\u2019ve been trying for year\u2019s to get my mother to tell her not to buy it for me as well as trying to state \u201cnot a tea drinker\u201d every time I see my sister.", "As a teacher who drinks coffee maybe 3-4 times per year, I feel this in my soul. I have so many coffee gift cards. (I know those places sell stuff besides coffee, but they're inconvenient to get to and I don't really like the other stuff enough to be worth the trip.)"]}
