Here's the thing my mom was ok with taking Sophie to the doctor and get her the implant but Mike freaked out and grounded her, she can't go out with her friends, she can't have her phone, and there's no way she can hang out with her boyfriend for the moment, now, when I was 16 myself I got the implant and have had it ever since, tbh if it wasn't for it I'd probably have a kid at the moment, I know birth control is super important, my mom knows too since she had me pretty young.\n\nA couple days ago I approached Sophie and told her that what she was feeling was normal and basically told her to just be careful, etc etc, the whole talk and I gave her a box of condoms, I also explained to her how to use them properly, I mean, I know for a fact this girl is already having sexual relationships with her long term boyfriend, I would like her to be safe at least, that same day I took her to the doctor and we both got tested just to be sure (medically you should get tested every six months, that's what doctors recommend) and afterwards we went out to eat, it was a nice bonding moment with her and i feel we both got closer, I like that she can trust me, I know I didn't have someone I could trust like she trusts me and that lead me to make many mistakes that could have been avoided.\n\nWell yesterday Mike went through Sophie's room and he found the condoms, he started screaming and yelling asking her where she got them, I told him that I had given them to her, Mike is furious with me because he says that I overstepped, that Sophie is his kid and he makes the decisions in her life not me, that I'm only her sister and I have no right to do this sort of stuff.\nMy mom while she agrees Mike is being overprotective agrees with him that I overstepped and that I should not get involved in these sort of situations.\n\nAita?\n\nTl,Dr: My little sister (16F) is starting to be sexually active, I gave her the talk and condoms and got her tested, my step father found out and is mad at me.\n\nEdit: Grammar", "created_utc": 1688081206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mjym5/aita_for_giving_my_little_sister_condoms/", "score": 378, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like Mike needs to grow up and realise that he actually isn't going to be in control of when/if Sophie has sex.\n\nShe's your sister, you're looking out for her.  Abstinence only education statistically does not effectively prevent pregnancy and STDs, condoms do (for the most part, they're not 100% or anything.)", "NTA.\n\nShe is a young person who is showing a clear interest in becoming sexually active. You had the good sense to make sure she\u2019s protected if and when she does take that step. \n\nHer father is reacting like an idiot, frankly. He\u2019s not using his head. He needs to understand that he may not like it, but if your sister wants to have sex, she\u2019s eventually going to, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d prefer for her to be safe in that scenario. \n\nNTA. Excellent Big-sistering!", "NTA \n\nBanning Sophie from having a social life is not going to be as effective as getting her access to birth control and being a safe person for her to turn too.", "NTA. Good for you for looking out for her. Also, you're not overstepping. You have your own relationship with her and you're allowed to give her advice (and condoms). Mike sucks.", "NTA\n\nDoes he plan to stand in front of her vagina for the next 2 years or until she is married.\n\nWould he prefer her to get pregnant or contract an STD, or both?\n\nFathers can be a bit unreasonable about their daughter's \"becoming women\". He may calm down or he may not. \n\nYou were actually addressing the reality of the situation. Regardless of what people think, teenagers have been screwing since before human society emerged and they'll keep doing it. That's how we have humans.", "NTA and Mike needs to think back to his teenage years.  If he would do so, he would remember that if they are going to have sex, they will find a way and he is just pushing her away.", "Mike is AH. And why was he going through Sophie's room?!", "NTA, does Mike have an overwhelming desire to be a grandfather?", "NTA - Good on you for looking out for your little sister when her father doesn't. I get why he's mad, after all we're talking about his relatively young daughter, but he needs to realize she will have sex regardless of his opinion, and it's better for her to do it safely.", "Maybe Mike wants to be a grandfather? In all seriousness though nta", "NTA at all, and Mike is a bad parent.  Saying no sex is all great and well, but that's not how the world works.  If she is going to do it regardless, safe sex is the way to go.  He is failing as a parent. You shouldn't even need to be doing this for her.  You should talk to your mom and get her to grow a back bone and protect her daughter.", "NTA - You did right by your sister. She could have gotten them from other places, or maybe not at all. Better that she definitely has them than taking unnecessary risks. Giving her someone she can trust when she clearly can't trust Mike is really important. You're a good sister.\n\nAnd WHY TF is Mike searching her room? Does she have a history of drug use or lying that would justify that kind of invasion of her privacy? And why does his discipline overrule your mom's decision to take her for the appointment? It sounds like they're not communicating with each other very well.\n\nMike sounds like he's scared, and seems to controlling (hard to tell without more information about their history and possible past bad behavior, and if this is normal behavior for him), and is probably acting out in anger because he doesn't know how to talk about that fear to your mom or to Sophie.", "NTA at all - good on you.

We've already long been had the talk about sex and birth control. We've discussed oral birth control and other options. None of that is relevant per se. Just, I'm a mom of a teen if that makes a difference. Anyway. \n\nNTA \n\nYour mom is in a tough spot. You said she was all good with the implant but Mike isn't, so she's managing a delicate balancing act between what she thinks is right and Mikes wishes or beliefs. I don't believe you over stepped though. If anything I would be very proud of you if you were my daughter. You took matters into your own hands to protect your sister and I think that just shows how much you love her.", "Eh, you're trying to mitigate the situation and inject a little harm-reduction. If she's already doing it, at this point it's a net good to give her condoms, although a LARC like she was wanting would be much better. The dad's got to put aside his discomfort and make a rational decision. \n\nNTA", "I love how EVERYONE jumped to the assumption that her wanting to be on birth control means she is having sex.\n\nSure, it's likely, but it's also possible she wanted to get on BC for the other benefits.\n\nRegardless, you were trying to help.\n\nMike is going to have to accept that she is growing up and may become intimate.\n\nNTA", "That is what older sisters are for! You did the right thing. And it\u2019s attitudes like mikes that lead to teenage STIs and pregnancies.", "NTA - mike is though and maybe you or your mom should talk to him about how trying to force celibacy and avoid teaching safe sex doesn\u2019t work.  If he still doesn\u2019t like it you could look into other ways of getting bc for her online.  I get the pill from nurx I think it\u2019s called, or she can get the ring from it too.  They come in a plain package so no one knows and on insurance it doesn\u2019t show that it\u2019s birth control.", "NTA. When both parents (yes, both in this case) have failed at a key duty then it's fine if another adult relative steps in. Good on you.", "NTA.   In my experience you can't control a teen only try to guide them, minimize the damage they can do. Especially girls, once they want sex there's not much to stop them. He's being protective and I understand the impulse, but he's being stupid. You just did what he should've. He's putting her at risk of getting pregnant because he can't accept her growing up.", "NTA......I had a step daughter and I talked to my husband and her mother at the time because I noticed she was being sexually active late 14 early 15 yr of age. They were surprised when she turned up pregnant and had a baby all while she was 15. She lost her parental rights due to her smoking weed while she was pregnant.  \n\nIt's always better to be safer than to have babies having babies and then it possibly ruining their lives.  It can have such an impact that they just don't understand and it sounds like the father would fly off hook if she does. \n\nI would rather have my daughter protected and have her future secure than have it unsure and rocky. \n\nKeep looking out for her because you may be the only person she has that she can talk to if she gets into trouble. I'm sure she feels blessed to at least have you.", "NTA I\u2019m glad someone is looking out for her.

I have kids about this age, and we\u2019ve talked about birth control. It\u2019s not a fun idea to think your baby is sexually active but I\u2019d rather they be safe than end up pregnant and too scared to tell me. He can\u2019t punish her forever, and the harder he tried the harder she\u2019s going to push back. Good on you for making a safe space for her,", "NTA. You are being responsible and helping your sister also be responsible. We all know that grounding teenagers and banning them from having sex works in 0% of situations!!\n\nOf course it will be hard for your stepdad to know his daughter is having sex, but surely being a grandfather to a teenage mother isn't something he wants either! \n\nYour sister is lucky to have someone look out for her and help her understand the importance of sexual health & contraception.", "NTA. Her dad is acting appropriately, and so are you.", "NTA. You're doing the right thing. At her age, she's gonna do it, might as well make sure she's got protection.", "NTA\n\nYou had good intentions and acted out of concern for your sister's well-being. Given that she expressed her desire to start birth control and is already sexually active, providing her with condoms and taking her for testing shows that you prioritize her safety and health.", "NTA.

You can't control a teenager, but you can help them make responsible decisions.", "NTA.  Heroic sibling, in fact.", "100% NTA.\nMike's way to protective. \nPretty shitty move from your mom to back up Mike.", "NTA. \n\n\nBut maybe you can keep it on your room and let her know where they will be so she can take them?", "NTA. Sounds like Mike is the one who needs to do the growing up, and she is lucky to have at least one responsible and supportive adult in her life.", "NTA\n\nNot all heroes wear capes.", "I was around her age when I went on my own and started birth control. My step sister (6 months older) happened to be at the clinic one time when I was there and told my step mother (her mom) and my dad whom I was living with at the time who both screamed at me....no question why my step sister was there (taking care of her own oops which them and the father didn't know about). My mom called and lit into him and he eased up. I wasn't \"active\" at the time but did have a boyfriend and wanted to he prepared, my mom told me to make sure I used condoms as well just in case.\n\nNTA her dad is ignorant if he thinks that trying to control her like that is going to prevent her from being active with her boyfriend. He should be proud of her for trying to prevent an oops rather than angry that she's growing up.", "You are a precious, caring, intelligent sister. Her father is the exact opposite of you.", "NTA\n\nYou're a good sister and I'm glad Sophie has you. Mike is a nightmare, and your mom is too for not standing up to him when Sophie's health and future is at stake. And Sophie's not doing anything wrong by having consensual sex with her age-peer boyfriend as long as she's being careful, which it sounds like she's trying to do.\n\nMike is a controlling AH and the source of all the problems here.", "NTA. Bless you my dear, you sound like an amazing sister.", "Not at all\n\nYou're being a great big sister, that's it. Mike is having a really hard time dealing with the fact that his daughter is having sex. If Mike really cares about you, he'll get over it in time", "NTA you're not overstepping, Mike didn't do the work to be able to handle his daughter growing up and becoming an independent woman.", "Though this is kind of a gray area in my opinion, I still say NTA because ultimately your sister's health and safety is far more important than respecting her parent's wishes.  So, yes, you did overstep, but it was a necessary overstep", "Mike is the AH. He needs to talk to a family therapist to understand how he is impacting his daughter.", "NTA. Sophie is NOT Mike's kid. He has absolutely NO say in what's going on here. Your mom needs to stand up for her daughters and tell Mike to stfu. Mike probably needs to leave, to be honest.

Mike's totally okay with being a grandpa at 42? And your mom is fine with your sister potentially pregnant or with STDs at 16? Just to keep the peace with your stepdad? Fabulous.\n\nKeep getting her condoms, give her better hiding spots (bottom of the box of tampons worked for me back in the day). You and your sister are being responsible, your Mom and Mike are being delusional and emotionally reactive.\n\nI absolutely get that it's difficult for parents when their children start having sex. Baby is growing up in a way with which they aren't comfortable. But it's going to happen. I mean, Mike was only 5 years older when he got together with your mom... I'm guessing he wasn't a virgin.

As another older sibling myself- youre doing the right thing and being a good big sister, looking out for and caring about ur lil sis. Sounds like mike needs to get over himself and stop thinking his daughter is a doll he can control- she's growing up and becoming her own person. Him throwing a tantrum isnt gonna stop ur sister- if anything, she's gonna keep doing what shes doing w her bf anyway cuz thats how teenagers are lol. Youre a good sister and your mom needs to realize you did NOT overstep- youre stepping UP to be there for your sis and help her be as safe and healthy as possible, and mike is very much so in the wrong for how he reacted and how he thinks he gets to control his daughter.

You\u2019re a good sister.", "YTA - She is a minor and she is not your child, so you should've had a discussion with her parents first before doing this.\n\n\n>(medically you should get tested every six months, that's what doctors recommend)\n\nIs your sister having unprotected sex with multiple partners? If not, this frequency of testing is unnecessary.", "You are NTA\nMike is NTA (at least not intentionally)\n\nI mean, from my point of view you, I understand the desire on Mike\u2019s part to protect her. In my opinion, I think it\u2019s better to wait until your married, but that\u2019s the way I see things. From this point do view, I wouldn\u2019t give her condoms nor would I encourage her to have sex with her bf. However, that isn\u2019t so much the question here and that\u2019s not what you\u2019re asking me or anybody else about. In this situation, there seems to be an unhealthy level of communication between Mike and your sister. As far as I can tell, she feels a need to hide things from him on this and he apparently does not handle such a delicate matter well. All in all, it sounds as if the line with her bf has already been crossed, but I\u2019d encourage one to ask themselves what is right in this situation. Is Mike\u2019s concern valid and just poorly expressed? Regardless (whether he is wrong or right), what steps can be taken to keep peace on this? I don\u2019t know if you overstepped, though. Family is family and siblings have every right to help each other. You may not agree with Mike about what is right on this, but also try to understand that he is her father and he is the authority in her life. That doesn\u2019t mean he can be overbearing and needlessly frustrate here, but he has a right to raise his daughter the way he sees fit within these bounds. Try to understand that on his part. Respect it important to us as men, and when something like this happens, we feel disrespected. I\u2019m not saying you have to agree with him (or me) about the best choice for your sister, but I think it\u2019s always important to show respect for our family members. Overall, though, you seem to be trying to do the right thing. You showed love towards your sister in the way that you made an effort to care for her, and I commend you for that.\n\nSorry for the length. I just really feel for you and for your family on this one. These sort of convos are never fun.", "NTA Maybe shortsighted, in that this was likely to happen, but not AH.\n\nGet some more condoms. Keep them in your room, let her know where they are.", "NTA.\n\nRegardless of my opinion of your stepdad's reaction, you were simply performing the single most important job we have as the older siblings.

You did good, sis.", "NTA...Mike better wake up and help his daughter to keep from getting pregnant by taking her to the doctor and establish some sort of birth control. Sex is a natural thing and him grounding her is not going to stop it. It is the natural evolution of things.", "NTA.

I don't think it's right to have different standards for different kids. I can't imagine letting a guy force me to raise my kids differently.", "NTA. I guess Mike just wants to be a grandfather or something, idk. There's a misconception that giving people safe-sex options will make them have sex more, but in reality, it just means the sex will be safe, not that it will happen more often, or that it would have happened less often if the safe option wasn't available.\n\nYou're looking out for  your half-sister in the only effective way possible and Mike is much more concerned with what he thinks his daughter should be doing than pragmatism.", "NTA\n\nMike has his head in the sand.

Do both parents have to sign something because she is a minor? If not, then your mother is a bigger asshole than Mike.

She came to hime because she trusted him and asked for help in being safe and protecting herself. He punished her for asking. All he is saying with this is that Sophie can\u2019t trust him to help when she needs it. He is not showing any respect for Sophie\u2019s decisions at all. She is doing the sensible thing. Regardless of whether she is engaging in sexual acts with her boyfriend or not, it doesn\u2019t hurt to be protected and that should be her decision to make about her body.", "You read something wrong. Mike is Sophie\u2019s father. Mike and OP\u2019s mom are together since OP was 2 years old. He has been in OP\u2019s life for 18 years and 16 years for Sophie (since she is his daughter).", "*starting at age 12, I left part of my thought out", "My feelings don't care about your facts!!! /s", "I think it's a case where you still sort of see them as your 'little girl', and so it a shock to learn that they are doing something so seemingly 'adult'. It's sort of the ultimate 'kids grow up too fast' moment. With that being said, you should obviously have a more mature response to it, and hopefully the dad will come to his senses sooner rather than later. I also wonder if the fact that she is female has anything to do with it. There does seem to be a lot more of a protective reaction from parents (especially fathers) when it comes to their daughters in comparison to their sons.", "He doesn't want his daughter having sex. That's quite clear but authoritarian control seems to be the problem. \n\nWhether that's because of cultural prudishness, religious indoctrination or just a refusal to accept that his daughter is not the child he considers her to be is not clear.\n\nHe's not misogynist but... /s", "It's not paranoia if they are out to get you!!! (whatever that even means in this context)", "Yeah and he can *say* he prefers her not to have sex. That\u2019s all! But he sounds like one of those parents that is more interested in control than guiding a human into adulthood.", "I re-read it and you're right. Thanks for letting me know. I'll edit my post.", "That may vary by state. Have you double checked your state laws?", "Not just the little girl.\n\nBut many fathers remember what it\u2019s like to be a young male, your hormones are out of control.\n\nSome boys will lie , and promise the world, to a lady, just to get in Her pants.", "All this suggestions are good, but honestly, take that girl to a women's health clinic and get her birth control asap.  Mike doesn't need to know and honestly with how he's acting its probably best he didn't."]}
