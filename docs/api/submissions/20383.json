That likes five naps in total quiet a day? Yeaaa. No. NTA", "NTA but acknowledge that YOU need the space and the day to adjust- not your 4mth old. They are least likely to need a day after traveling. They will still be in a strange place with an unsettled mom and a day isn\u2019t really going to matter to their schedule at all- they are portable.  They sleep wherever. They are more unsettled because you are unsettled. \n\nYou as mom, you Need the day. You need to settle, sleep, get comfortable with jet lag and new schedule. \n\nIdea- get a breast pump and get kid to bottle feed. Take your day or day and 1/2. Give baby off to dad and family. \nStay close. Pump- pass the milk off. Let them care for the baby. Let them even though it is hard to do. They can. Babies that young unless very medically fragile are not strange to people. They are babies and quiet and loud families have taken care of them the world over.  It will be good for dad to be the parent. It will be good for you to have a break. \n\nSettle yourself. Make time for yourself\u2026. The baby will be fine. If they cry, they will be comforted and held and will be loved and passed around. \nIf it goes wrong and baby won\u2019t settle they will bring baby back to you\u2026. I\u2019ll bet it won\u2019t go wrong though. \n\nYou will be anxious that it will go wrong- But a loving and boisterous family will not harm a baby for 24 or 36 hours. Give yourself a break. \n\nEstablish your sleeping schedule. You will be a better parent for trusting others. \n\nI remember leaving my 4mth old with my mom for the first time worries he wasn\u2019t taking a bottle. All mom said was \u201che will be fine.

There\u2019s a strong mob mentality and your husband is in on it, I think you have to prepare on being inundated from the second your feet hit land, that\u2019s life, maybe bring a baby carrier and shove him in it and cover his head with a muslin blanket if he needs a break? Hopefully you\u2019ll look back in 40 years and find something positive about this experience.", "NTA - 1 day to rest is a very reasonable request and you have all the right to set boundaries for you and your son.

I\u2019d honestly tell them if they can\u2019t give you one day you can\u2019t visit.", "NTA. They're being overdramatic. It's not asking too much to get a little rest in and recharge. Travelling that distance with a newborn is stressful as is. Your terms are very fair. I don't know why your husband isn't backing you up. It's just one day.", "NTA at all! Only asking for one day is more than fair. At 5 months old, babies can get easily overstimulated especially when it comes to crowds/new people also, because the baby is new to the family everyone will want to see/hold/interact with the baby so if his routine isn't in place he's really going to struggle. Taking one day to try and do this is more than a fair compromise. \nJust because it's their culture doesn't mean it's the only culture allowed within your family. Your baby and your needs are important too.", "In other cultures they don't raise their kids like a doll. They raise the babies to adjust to the environment. Do you think when the baby naps they will be quiet or not pick the baby up. \nBe realistic. They are not gonna listen or understand your point of view. So I'm sorry but you gotta figure it out and deal", "NTA.

Do you guys argue a lot about decisions being made?  Does he dictate to you what is taking place and how you are to react?  Or do you do that to him?\n\nThere is something else at play here.  I dont know if its a power struggle with your husband, power struggle with his family or possibly you are trying to be controlling. The ONLY reason I added the last is the crazy reaction and outburst from him and his side of family.  \n\nHell, it could all just be you are a new mom and youre stressed.  \n\nThats the options I see.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We\u2019ve had some small disagreements on things regarding our son, but we\u2019ve worked it all out. I\u2019m on maternity leave right now, so I spend most time with our son anyway, while husband is at work. Since we\u2019re first time parents, that leads to mostly me figuring things out (for example what our son likes & doesn\u2019t like, how and where to nap\u2026) because I spend more time with him. Maybe this is what is bothering my husband and he thinks I\u2019m controlling, but he usually doesn\u2019t say anything to me, so I figured it\u2019s all okay?", "I did propose that :) I said we can just rent an Airbnb for 2 days!

So all the controlling stuff is off the table, thats good.\n\nI think you nailed it with the introvert/extrovert idea.  You know the saying, to make a marriage work you need an extrovert matched with an introvert.  Well I am guessing you got the modified extrovert from your husbands side and he may actually be considered and introvert by his very outgoing side of his family.\n\nMaybe both of you just need to take a breath and have another talk.

That you are a new mom and just dont feel comfortable with exposing your brand new baby to any loud environments at the onset of a long trip.  \n\nOne thing I ask you remember, and this is just stereotypical, the dad usually takes chances and gives more latitude with the kids and mom is usually very conservative, especially with the first.  I have our 9 yo driving around the pasture in our truck (I'm in the cab with him) but mom wouldnt even dream of letting him drive.

If they are really fussy from short naps, they WILL get tired and sleep eventually. PLEASE make sure hubby and MIL get to enjoy those fussy times taking care of the baby. You should be \"suffering from jet lag\" and laying down yourself then. Do bring a white noise machine to help. Also, giving a bottle during take off facilitates swallowing to decrease the chance of an ear infection (or, that used to be a thing, please check with your pediatrician)\n\nI absolutely agree with you that having some time before the family craziness ensues will be critical for you.

Baby may end up being overtired and near meltdown, and then the parents will need even more time for the baby to calm down.\n* OP going to rest and letting MIL deal with the baby and the other 20+ relatives can backfire. Cultural differences may lead to them trying to soothe the baby by giving him food he's not familiar with.\n* Also, the husband doesn't see eye to eye bc him going back to his parents' house means he can kick back, rest and be babied by his mother for the first few days. He will expect OP and his mother to deal with the baby's adaptation and visitor circus while he enjoys \"family time\" with the relatives he hasn't seen in a while.\n\nI am not saying that the above WILL happen.
