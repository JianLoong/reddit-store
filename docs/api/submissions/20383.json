They will still be in a strange place with an unsettled mom and a day isn\u2019t really going to matter to their schedule at all- they are portable.  They sleep wherever. They are more unsettled because you are unsettled. \n\nYou as mom, you Need the day. You need to settle, sleep, get comfortable with jet lag and new schedule. \n\nIdea- get a breast pump and get kid to bottle feed. Take your day or day and 1/2. Give baby off to dad and family. \nStay close. Pump- pass the milk off. Let them care for the baby. Let them even though it is hard to do. They can.

It will be good for dad to be the parent. It will be good for you to have a break. \n\nSettle yourself. Make time for yourself\u2026. The baby will be fine. If they cry, they will be comforted and held and will be loved and passed around. \nIf it goes wrong and baby won\u2019t settle they will bring baby back to you\u2026. I\u2019ll bet it won\u2019t go wrong though. \n\nYou will be anxious that it will go wrong- But a loving and boisterous family will not harm a baby for 24 or 36 hours.

You will be a better parent for trusting others. \n\nI remember leaving my 4mth old with my mom for the first time worries he wasn\u2019t taking a bottle. All mom said was \u201che will be fine.

There\u2019s a strong mob mentality and your husband is in on it, I think you have to prepare on being inundated from the second your feet hit land, that\u2019s life, maybe bring a baby carrier and shove him in it and cover his head with a muslin blanket if he needs a break?

Travelling that distance with a newborn is stressful as is. Your terms are very fair. I don't know why your husband isn't backing you up. It's just one day.", "NTA at all! Only asking for one day is more than fair. At 5 months old, babies can get easily overstimulated especially when it comes to crowds/new people also, because the baby is new to the family everyone will want to see/hold/interact with the baby so if his routine isn't in place he's really going to struggle. Taking one day to try and do this is more than a fair compromise. \nJust because it's their culture doesn't mean it's the only culture allowed within your family. Your baby and your needs are important too.", "In other cultures they don't raise their kids like a doll. They raise the babies to adjust to the environment. Do you think when the baby naps they will be quiet or not pick the baby up. \nBe realistic. They are not gonna listen or understand your point of view.

I dont know if its a power struggle with your husband, power struggle with his family or possibly you are trying to be controlling.

We\u2019ve had some small disagreements on things regarding our son, but we\u2019ve worked it all out. I\u2019m on maternity leave right now, so I spend most time with our son anyway, while husband is at work. Since we\u2019re first time parents, that leads to mostly me figuring things out (for example what our son likes & doesn\u2019t like, how and where to nap\u2026) because I spend more time with him. Maybe this is what is bothering my husband and he thinks I\u2019m controlling, but he usually doesn\u2019t say anything to me, so I figured it\u2019s all okay?", "I did propose that :) I said we can just rent an Airbnb for 2 days!

So all the controlling stuff is off the table, thats good.\n\nI think you nailed it with the introvert/extrovert idea.  You know the saying, to make a marriage work you need an extrovert matched with an introvert.  Well I am guessing you got the modified extrovert from your husbands side and he may actually be considered and introvert by his very outgoing side of his family.\n\nMaybe both of you just need to take a breath and have another talk.

I have our 9 yo driving around the pasture in our truck (I'm in the cab with him) but mom wouldnt even dream of letting him drive.

If they are really fussy from short naps, they WILL get tired and sleep eventually. PLEASE make sure hubby and MIL get to enjoy those fussy times taking care of the baby. You should be \"suffering from jet lag\" and laying down yourself then. Do bring a white noise machine to help. Also, giving a bottle during take off facilitates swallowing to decrease the chance of an ear infection (or, that used to be a thing, please check with your pediatrician)\n\nI absolutely agree with you that having some time before the family craziness ensues will be critical for you.

Baby may end up being overtired and near meltdown, and then the parents will need even more time for the baby to calm down.\n* OP going to rest and letting MIL deal with the baby and the other 20+ relatives can backfire. Cultural differences may lead to them trying to soothe the baby by giving him food he's not familiar with.\n* Also, the husband doesn't see eye to eye bc him going back to his parents' house means he can kick back, rest and be babied by his mother for the first few days.

I think this is more to do with culture, south african culture like many other countries in africa and the east has a larger and closer knit family dynamic when compared with central Europe. So I think youre NTA because you've obviously not grown up with that dynamic, but you are going to go visit them in their country so I feel like you should also respect their dynamic a bit more and just have visitors that day. I feel like a lot of people on here forget that social norms and ideas exist and its not just about one person. Just because youre not doing someone wrong doesnt mean youre not the asshole", "I'm going with a bit of ESH.  Your husband for not understanding that you and the baby could use one day of quiet time after arriving after a long trip.  And you for knowing how the family is yet not trying to do anything to help yourself or your social anxiety.  There are therapies and meds that can help so that you aren't so anxious.  His family is not going to change, so that means that you will have to if you want to stay with your husband.  But he also needs to stand up to his family and tell them that the one day rule is not an unrealistic one.  I feel for you OP, I would feel the same way as you most likely.

I'm so sorry you're in this situation. \n\nIn my opinion, this is where the husband needs to step in and  put down some boundaries. You're already making huge sacrifices by going to spend a month there in an environment you're not overly comfortable with. Anytime someone starts dictating what's best for your baby is inappropriate. Putting emotions and egos above the needs of a baby is plain wrong. But that aside, why are you even in a position to justify a very reasonable request?\n\nBoundaries need to be set down, likely by, or at least with great help from your husband. Can no one in the family really understand your POV? Sheesh. \n\nYou're the one that needs to deal with the consequences of the baby breaking out of their routine, having jetlag, etc etc. Your husband's family need to understand - firmly - that the way you live your life is not a debating matter.

I won't opine because this is not what I'm here for, but I think I can shed some light on their side of the story.\n\n>They always have visitors over, and the visitors don't need to announce themselves beforehand, they just come over. Uncles, aunts, cousins, the house there is always full.\n\nThis is pretty normal, from my experience. You say they don't understand what social anxiety is, and I don't doubt that; but I *believe* there is, on their part, some level of discomfort with you leaving the room.\n\nIt is very common for people from outside Latam to be kinda disdainful and dismissive towards us. At least, there is among some of us the expectation that they will be.\n\nI am **NOT** saying you *are* being unkind, not at all, but there is some chance of them seeing you leave the room and reacting on this old instinct. \"Does she think she is better than us?\", and the like. I'll give advice on the assumption that you haven't tried anything, simply to make it a bit easier on myself: why don't you try going to some senior figure in the family, such as MIL if you have a good rapport with her, before you go?\n\nSomething such as \"I'm feeling a bit tired, I'll lay down for a bit, but please tell everyone I've loved to see them.\" I say this because I am from a very extroverted family while being *incredibly* introverted myself; of course, I have the advantage of being known by them my entire life, but at family functions when my energy runs out, this usually works.\n\nIt could be - *could* be - that they see you discreetly leaving the room without talking to anyone and feel a bit slighted. Family is everything in Latam. When I was young, I would try to tell my mom I didn't feel like talking to our third half-cousin's girlfriend's daughter's boyfriend-in-law and she'd look at me as if I was a talking horse: Don't YOU want to be among Family? How come?\n\nYou don't have to be Amongst all the time, nor must you explain that you have social anxiety. \"I feel a bit tired\" is good enough, in my experience.\n\nAnother thing, and this I think is the core of the problem here, is that for us (or at least me and mine, who seem to resemble Husband and his somewhat), there is Visitors, and there is Family.\n\nVisitors have to announce themselves, at least by a phone call an hour before arriving, or suchlike. Family does not.\n\n\"But they don't live here!\" Well, it doesn't really matter. One of the worst things I could do would be to \"close the door to Family\" unless there is a serious reason. My grandfather would spin so hard on the grave the world would discover a new form of energy. Family - uncles, aunts, siblings, close friends even - are *expected* to feel absolutely at ease at each other's homes and company.\n\nI understand how you feel, I truly do. I'm introverted as FUCK. But if me and my parents went to some family member's house when I was a teen, and I acted as if I wanted to run away (because I often did), it would be a discourtesy. There are levels of how comfortable you must be, of course, but if someone visits Family and feels visibly uncomfortable, the hosts will feel a bit offended. It is the idea of being rejected, of someone who isn't there because they want to be Amongst Family, but is just filling a social norm.\n\nThis idea of Family is confusing because the EXPECTATION is \"no social mores, we're Family\", but there ARE several unwritten rules. Comfortable socialization is worth its weight in gold; not engaging is a breach of etiquette. \"I didn't do anything to anyone though?\" Tell me about it. But the discomfort, or the apparent discomfort, is Bad.\n\nIt **may** be that your social anxiety, not being in your own familiar culture (fish out of water feeling), plus the perception that Europeans are colder than us, made people feel that you are rejecting them. And rejection, isolation, is associated with arrogance - \"too good for this\".\n\nAs for the baby thing, it applies as well. I was a kid then, but I remember that when my sibling was born, Visitors from all over our parents social net showed up. Visiting the baby is important, is a little bit of a ritual. Most show up with a gift of some kind (I remember the house having diapers galore). People that hadn't seen us in years. And my parents DID think it was a bother, but Heaven Forbid you don't go through with it. To an American, it would be the same as wearing white to a wedding; a harsh, harsh slight. My cousin had a baby recently, and guess what we're gearing up to do?\n\nIf Visitors do it, Family will be expected to do it. And the bundle of the aforementioned comfort + ease + lessened barriers are intrinsic to Family.\n\nI'm guessing that you said something like not wanting visitors, which is fine, but on their heads it sounded like \"So you don't want your baby to go through the tradition?\", playing up on all of the above. It may be that this is what \"taking the baby away\" means - are you equating family to strangers? Are you saying they are not welcome in your home? Are you saying you don't want your baby to go through the rituals?\n\nLook, I'm not saying it is impossible they are hardheaded xenophobes who construed everything you said and did in the most mean-spirited way imaginable. It can be that, easily. \"There is a cultural explanation\" doesn't equal \"let them walk all over you, swallow your discomfort because you are a foreigner\". **This is not what I mean.** \n\nI'm just trying to present an alternative interpretation. When I read you saying why you wanted a quiet day, it made sense to me. But I kinda agreed with them reflexively, and when I thought of why, I came up with this.\n\nMaybe try rewording your request, first to Husband, then to someone else you trust in that environment, with his help. I would emphasize FOR A DAY, if I were you. You are not the wrong at all. I just mean to show that there is the possibility - **possibility** - they aren't just going off on you for no reason. It sounds like culture clash to me.\n\nIf I think about it, this whole tradition sounds like a pain. As a kid I thought it was hilarious because my parents complained but went all sunny as soon as the door opened. Now I get it - if I had a young baby and someone(s) tried to come to my home, I would pitch a nuclear fit. But you know how people get when the t-word is involved.\n\nThen again, I am an Internet stranger. You know them and I don't. Everything I wrote is a rose-glasses hope of them being kind and reasonable, and it all boiling down to miscommunication. If you decide \"this is where the bridge burns\", well, who am I to judge you for it? Do what will make you feel better, is all I say. Fussy babies are miniature Kaijus.\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nI'm so glad you said that at the end. Your baby needs that day. Also hell no to your child being treated like something to parade and be handed round a room after such a long journey.\n\nI'd personally say a couple of days of just the immediate family in the house.

If baby get\u2019s moody, then gets back to mom without a question.

He is devaluing your needs and feelings, demanding they be just like his or be ignored. \n\nI can see why you already feel overwhelmed and exhausted by this trip. Your needs are being attacked and devalued instead of supported. He is demanding you not be as you are for his convenience and at your expense. That way, he doesn't have to consider and support your separate and different needs.\n\nHis bringing his family into the argument, to shut you up by being outnumbered, is dirty fighting. That he does that rather than listen, accept and support your needs as well as his own reflects poorly on him as a partner. He SHOULD stand with you, plan safe retreats and quiet times for you in the itinerary, and present that plan to his family as THE plan.\n\nThe fact you also have a young infant, and he still devalues and ignores your needs to be safe and rested during the trip...well that makes him 10x more selfish and cruel. \"Be overwhelmed, overstimulated, exhausted and uncomfortable for an extended period, while tending our infant. Act happy about it and quit complaining.\" That seems to be his attitude.\n\nI think you're right to refuse a trip you know would be hellacious. Let him visit alone until your child is old enough to accompany him without you, or he becomes willing to support your health and well being as part of the planning.", "Her husband can't put his foot down; it isn't his house and he doesn't get to say who they have over. \n\nThey can, however, decide to stay elsewhere.", "Ive been in therapy for 8 years, and I\u2019m on anti anxiety meds.

That's a lot of people to have exposure to on a regular basis, COVID/RSV are still a thing. It's not really that safe for the infant. Additionally, you have a need to decompress from people after a period of time and your husband needs to honor that as your partner. He and his family don't get to dictate or override what you need to be at your best.
