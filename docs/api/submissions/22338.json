I\u2019m female as well\n2. My sister made fun of me all day Thursday because I wore a thong bikini for the first time ever in public. She kept saying \u201cyou haven\u2019t done enough squats to deserve that bathing suit.\u201d I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an asshole, I just mention it because that kind of teasing is what we\u2019ve always done. \n3.

My sister made fun of me without mercy when we were growing up for this\u2014that is where squid face comes from because squids are white.\n\nSo for background my family is on a vacation with my parents. We kids are 25, 22 and 17. I\u2019m 22 and my sister is 25. \n\nWe went out to eat at our traditional seafood place on the first night and she fell head over heels in love with the bartender and she\u2019s been texting him since but hasn\u2019t been able to arrange a meet up. My dad said he was having a massive craving for their salmon so we went back last night. \n\nI  guess in anticipation of seeing this guy my sister wore a cross top \u201cblouse\u201d that literally had her boobs spilling out the top, bottom and sides. I absolutely cracked up laughing because I knew what she was up to. Then my brother started laughing. My mom was telling us to shut up but I could tell she was having a hard time not laughing. \n\nIt turns out the guy had to leave early so my sister was in a pissy mood but I couldn\u2019t help but tell her \u201chey don\u2019t jump in that top.\u201d She told me she\u2019s not in the mood but I couldn\u2019t help myself so I kept saying things like \u201cno sudden moves Stef\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s breezy in here, good thing I wore I sweater or I\u2019d be poking out like you.\u201d She ate her dinner in silence but in the car I said \u201chey dad go slow over the speed bumps or Stef is going to give us all a show.\u201d \n\nshe lost her shit with me like she did when we were kids. And I mean screaming, crying \u201cfuck you,\u201d she called me \u201csquid face\u201d which I haven\u2019t heard since we were like 12 and 9. When we got in she slammed the door to her room and just opened it long enough to tell me she\u2019s never speaking to me again. She apparently has been sleeping all day and didn\u2019t even come out for coffee. \n\nMy mom and dad said that I took it way too far and I added fuel to the flame of my sister feeling like she was \u201crejected\u201d again (her engagement broke up in April). \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689458001, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150o6m1/aita_for_laughing_at_my_sisters_ridiculous_boobs/", "score": 1518, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are a disgusting, vile piece of work. What you did was beyond a simple joke. It was an intentional targeted bully to a vulnerable person.

Seems to me like she was the type of older sister to tease you a lot and this is learned behaviour from her or even maybe started with your parents so I don't feel bad for her one bit. I can tell from both of your sides you guys are hurting each other's feelings and being catty and disguising it as jokes.\nThe family dynamic seems toxic to me. Reminds me of the Kardashians who seem super close and roast each other so much but in reality they have no boundaries and deep down are catty and seem to dislike each other.\nEveryone is calling OP childish or a bully but it seems to be something normal in their family.  Op's family is probably the family you ate over at as a kid and was shocked about how normal your own family is after all.

The jokes were very \u201cteenage boy\u201d and not \u201cadult woman\u201d", "No mate, nothing excuses this sort of body shaming. You don't need to be large or small chested, short or tall, fat or thin to be an AH. Suggesting that the only reason OP chose to be an AH is because she is insecure of her chest is body shaming when you can instead suggest that OP chose to be an AH because she is a bully. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a sub that detests body shaming, it sure seems to love body shaming people they want to shit on.", "Jealous? Just sounds like she is an AH. Maybe a bit of a bully complex where she keeps using the same joke to tear her down but we seriously need to stop with this \"inventing backstories to make an AH look like a devil\" game. \n\nPeople can be AHs without being insecure about body features, abusers, gaslighters etc", "Not gonna lie, it did come off as body shame-y. Totally agree with the fact that the OP is an asshole but that was also an asshole comment.", "And people say this sub isn't gender biased", "I expect this is a life long back and forth. How else would she get a handle like squid face. I have 7 brothers and sisters. Tons of this shit going on between the various siblings pretty much all the time growing up. The hate doesn\u2019t last forever ,NTA", "I\u2019m sorry if your parents are threatened by the fact that you are a sexual creature, but mine aren\u2019t. \n\nYou are right though, it is a choice. OP\u2019s sister\u2019s choice and no one else\u2019s. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t even trust OP\u2019s description of the top because she doesn\u2019t strike me as reliable narrator.", "See, that\u2019s funny to me, because I have worked as a bartender for over a decade. And if someone\u2019s biggest sexual overture was a back and forth text conversation and then wearing a sexy outfit in anticipation of seeing me, that would be a dream. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re trying to crucify this women for sexual harassment when by OP\u2019s own admission she didn\u2019t even see or interact with the bartender that night!  \n\nHonestly, you sound like someone who is probably still very young, or sheltered, to have such an exaggerated reaction to woman wearing a top she thinks makes her look sexy. You\u2019re beyond prudish, you\u2019re puritanical (on top of the pre-existing misogyny, of course).", "I started developing in 4th grade so I've had a large chest for most of my life. \"Careful over speed bumps\" \"poking out\" \"don't jump\" ? Really? These were middle school jokes at best.", "YTA. Stop talking about your sisters boobs, squid face.", "It wakes it more unfortunate because as a woman you should know better then to put down other women. She should be able to put herself in her shoes. Them being sisters makes it 100% worse because you don\u2019t tear down your family. She just lost her relationship and decides to put herself out there in a nice top (I bet she looked fantastic) and she\u2019s probably a little nervous/self conscious. OP is TA sister and an even bigger TA woman. Stop freaking out when people mention gender.", "Either way OP said she is jealous of her sister's size", "Are you seriously defending OP right now?", "i am a woman who has a sister. i would feel so violated if she \"joked\" about my breasts in public.", "Most of reddit loves getting in body-shamey cheap shots and then saying, \"we'll I don't think it's bad, I'm just saying it cause it bothers them\"", "She\u2019s super jealous. After I made that comment I went through her comments and she admits she is jealous in at least one of them.\n\nSo i wasn\u2019t \u201cinventing\u201d but more I can spot a jealous AH a mile away.", "No, body shaming would be knowing what a woman looks like, and putting her down based on that. That would be shaming her body. This is not body shaming, it's a joke. With set up that everyone understands, and the punchline being the asshole, not her boobs", "Well it all makes sense. You\u2019re jealous of your sister so you decided to verbally abuse her incessantly while she was already feeling down. Did it make you feel better about yourself?", "Teasing is funny.  You were just flat out mean.  Your life will be better once you learn to be accountable for your behavior.  This will be a good place to start learning this.\n\nApologize - the RIGHT way - to her.  Now.  Today.\n\nYTA", "Teasing doesn\u2019t usually extend over several hours and to the point the other is crying. \n\nAlso, her engagement just ended you do this?! I\u2019d never speak to you again.", "You are both old enough now to know that teasing can hurt peoples feelings. Maybe it\u2019s not as funny as it used to be when you were both little kids. Maybe it\u2019s time to grow up and understand that actions have consequences.", "Teasing isn't going on and on about a single subject. That was in bullying terrritory.", "You\u2019re jealous of her? Yeah, we can tell.\n\nYou brought this on yourself by comparing yourself to her. It\u2019s also odd to make multiple jokes centered on your sister\u2019s boobs. You\u2019re weird.", "There are always going to be prettier girls with bigger boobs dressed sexier than you. Learn to deal with it. Talking shit just makes you look like a pathetic cow.", "teasing ends when you're told to stop. otherwise you're just being a bully.", "What's wrong? Discover sometimes a D is better than a B? Your story shows you are more than a little jealous since the entire night of your bullying was about her boobs. Really classy BTW in front of her father. Do you get a thrill over embarrassing your sister and trying to make her feel bad about her body? Before you try to deny that's what you were doing, actually look at what transpired.  Because that's what happened.", "Clearly you\u2019re young, but you should know that obsessively bullying someone you\u2019re obviously jealous of is extremely transparent and cringy to everyone around. You\u2019re going to be so embarrassed by your behavior if you ever mature.", "You\u2019re a sad jealous little girl who never grew up and it shows. Ugly inside and out. Boooooo.", "Teasing doesn't happen constantly over the course of hours after the person clearly seems upset. You're an adult, it's time to be supportive of your siblings and leave the childish roles behind.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve always tease(d) each other like this\u201d\u2026something tells me she doesn\u2019t subscribe to the idea that your history of bullying was just teasing. It\u2019s mean-spirited, and a horrible example for your younger brother.", "So you found an opening to hurt her feelings and kept picking at it for hours until she cried? It\u2019s not okay to tease (aka bully) people like that", "Oh, so the truth comes out.", "Ooop we found out the reason for OP\u2019s behaviour. They are the average sister and they are jealous of the pretty sister who gets attention.", "Oh I know Im a middle child lmfao she should still apologize regardless of your reasoning and the fact they are siblings. Having siblings doesn\u2019t opt you out of being a decent person to your siblings. I went from all out war to actually being at peace with mine, apologies go a long way.", "wearing a tiny crop top where not only are your tits spilling out but your nipples are showing during a family dinner is weird asf.", "Don\u2019t forget she was not going there alone but with her mom, dad, and two siblings lmfaoooo", "She intended to and it was only through dumb luck that he wasn't there. Also, please, explain how I'm misogynistic?", "Where did she say that? I never saw that comment.", "wow you must have a small penis. \n\nlike that? because i agree with you, it's not nice", "For example, telling your sister she doesn't deserve to wear a thong bikini is body shaming.", "is this not what everyone is saying OP is an asshole for? \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab my goodness", "Calm down, you may not have intended to have a body shame over tone but it kinda does. I\u2019m just saying it reads very poorly.", "And OP said her sister\u2019s nipples were out where in their post?  Why are you rushing to defense of a sniveling unfunny jealous bully? \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re family is scared of breasts and sexuality, too. Maybe your parents forgot how you were made?", "You are quite literally judging a woman\u2019s character by a clothing choice she made. That\u2019s misogyny, babe. \n\nAnd dumb luck made it so he didn\u2019t get to ogle OP\u2019s sister\u2019s rack like she had hoped. Again, not a sex crime.", "why don\u2019t you try reading over the post one more time, since your reading comprehension doesn\u2019t seem to be up to par? \ud83e\udd20", "No. I'm judging her for the reason she made the clothing choice, which was to harrass the bartender.", "You are questioning my reading comprehension abilities when you\u2019re extrapolating nipple appearances never mentioned by OP in their jealous bullying session. Good work, champ.", "You are judging her clothing choices and then making up insane scenarios that never happened. \n\nAccording to you, her biggest crime was wanting to hook up with a bartender who had exchanged numbers with her and kept up a conversation over a week. You have made up imaginary sexual harassment claims because she dared to exist as a sexual being.  \n\nEnjoy your convent and habit, Mother Superior. I\u2019ll be here, tits out, and feeling good.", "damn you rly that dumb huh? \ud83e\udd72\n\n\"it's breezy in here, good thing I wore I sweater or I'd be poking out like you.\"\n\nsorry bout that reading comprehension champ. you\u2019ll get there someday! \ud83d\udda4", "And I'll be laughing when you get charged for harassing some guy at his job like OP's sister.", "You realize nipples can show through fabric when hard, right?  Like\u2026there is a whole ass S&tC episode about this. You can\u2019t seriously be accusing OP\u2019s sister of having nipples that may have reacted to a change in temperature. \ud83d\ude05\n\nAgain, I\u2019m sorry your parents raised you to act like you don\u2019t have nipples. That was really unfair of them and I hope you heal when you\u2019re done dickriding for OP.", "Ahahahahahhahahaha. What crime would I be commuting?  Being a baddie with a banging rack that the boys want to fuck?  \n\nYou sound just as jealous as OP, y\u2019all should link up and judge women who are prettier than you together."]}
