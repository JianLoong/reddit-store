This could have been the kind of teasing that would just make for a fun night & a good memory. It was funny and doesn't strike me as mean-spirited. \n\nBut part of teasing \\*lovingly\\* is that you pay attention to how the subject is reacting. If they're not responding in kind, not laughing, if their mood is getting worse and not better... you need to stop. \n\nIt sounds like you were aware of your sister's deteriorating mood, and aware that your teasing had passed the point of being fun & become hurtful.
