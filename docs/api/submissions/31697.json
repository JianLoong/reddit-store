I married my wife (34F) from Ukraine five years ago. We have a 4-year-old son together, and I also have a 12-year-old from a previous marriage.\r  \n\r  \nA few years ago, when the conflict in Ukraine escalated, my wife pressured me to move her family to the US. I sponsored her brother\u2019s family under the Uniting for Ukraine program and paid for everything, including their living expenses. However, her brother and sister-in-law didn't make any effort to adapt. He spent his days drinking and smoking, littering our porch with beer cans and whiskey bottles. I eventually found him a job, but he quit, complaining about the pay. His wife complained about the cost of living and didn't try to learn to drive or speak English. After three months, they left for Germany, seeking better benefits, but soon wanted to return. I refused to help them further.\r  \n\r  \nNext, I brought over my wife's mother and stepfather. Her stepfather drinks heavily and only does yard work, while her mother spends all day cooking and watching TV, creating a fruit fly issue in our house. They show no effort to integrate or learn English.\r  \n\r  \nThe final straw came when my wife, who doesn\u2019t work, asked me to buy them a house. She has no understanding of mortgages or real estate. I've been overworking myself, holding multiple jobs to support everyone, but I recently cut back to focus on my fitness and mental health. When I suggested she get a job to support her family, she got angry.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m tired of the disrespect, the uncleanliness, and the financial burden. I regret sponsoring them under the Uniting for Ukraine program, as they have been disrespectful and ungrateful. Moreover, her parents don't even support Ukraine, instead aligning with Russia, causing tension.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife thinks I'm the asshole for not wanting to help her family anymore and for suggesting she get a job. She insists she needs to stay home for our son, who will start public school next year. I\u2019m willing to arrange daycare or let him stay with his grandmother.\r  \n\r  \nAITA for wanting my wife to contribute financially and for refusing to support her family any further?", "created_utc": 1700930757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183nsvx/aita_for_refusing_to_financially_support_my_wifes/", "score": 296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have already taken on her child, then had taken in her brother and his family.  Then her parents.  To have the audacity to expect you to buy her parents a house - I have no words.  To not want to work is adding insult, particularly when watching you hold down multiple jobs already and your mental health has been suffering.  Honestly, I don\u2019t like saying it but does she think she has a cash cow?

Heavy drinking on the male part is also a norm.\nWhen you sponsored your wife, you signed papers that you will support her for 10 years. I do not know how long you have to support her mom.\n\nSo here are my suggestions:\nCut them all from cash. They need grocery, they give you a list, and you order and pay for it (so no more alcohol).\nRemove your wife's access to join accounts / credit cards, etc. This is brutal, but she will keep supporting her parents behind your back. She wants money, = she can work. Lock your credit.\nTeach your wife about income, expenses, real estate, taxes, retirement, etc. All these items are foreign to her, and she does not know / understand how stuff works in the US. \nInvolve your wife in your friends' groups.
