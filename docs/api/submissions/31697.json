However, her brother and sister-in-law didn't make any effort to adapt. He spent his days drinking and smoking, littering our porch with beer cans and whiskey bottles. I eventually found him a job, but he quit, complaining about the pay. His wife complained about the cost of living and didn't try to learn to drive or speak English. After three months, they left for Germany, seeking better benefits, but soon wanted to return. I refused to help them further.\r  \n\r  \nNext, I brought over my wife's mother and stepfather. Her stepfather drinks heavily and only does yard work, while her mother spends all day cooking and watching TV, creating a fruit fly issue in our house. They show no effort to integrate or learn English.\r  \n\r  \nThe final straw came when my wife, who doesn\u2019t work, asked me to buy them a house.

Moreover, her parents don't even support Ukraine, instead aligning with Russia, causing tension.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife thinks I'm the asshole for not wanting to help her family anymore and for suggesting she get a job.

It certainly seems like they met online (mail order is albeit outdated) He also has a one dimensional view of her personality and doesn\u2019t mention her being a good mother or anything any positive traits that would lead to feeling specifically conflicted.

Their relationship began before he became financially successful. However, once he achieved some significant financial success, he started getting involved with other women here in the States and got into gambling and drugs.  \nIt's important to understand that sports culture over there is vastly different from what we have in the States. When you show talent in a particular sport at a young age, you are often taken out of regular school to focus on that sport as your primary education. My wife, for instance, left home at the age of 12 to live in Kyiv without her parents due to her athletic pursuits.  \nBecause of these cultural differences, I never really saw my wife as a gold-digger, and I still don't. I think the core issue is more of a cultural misunderstanding and differing expectations from a husband.

Its nuts how many people seem to not know any immigrants.  I think caring for her parents is probably a personal family culture thing. My family can literally trace our time here in the US to the Mayflower, and my mom lives rent free with me. She has lived with me since she retired early at age 58 due to physical disability. Her mother lived rent free with one of her sisters then one of her brothers for the last 30 years of her life. We just support our elder family members.  If my MIL wanted to move to the US I would move her into my home and support her too, its just how I was raised.\n\n I wouldn't put up with an elderly alcoholic in my home around my young kids though. That's not good.  Your in-laws are going to need to move into their own place soon just because of FILs drinking alone.  I would approach this with your wife from this angle.  You'll probably need to agree on a monthly amount of money to help them with- and believe me it will be worth 1000 a month or so to keep this tension out of your home. Your wife is going to need some sort of job to help pay for this. You've got to look at community resources, figure out where they can live and how much you can afford to help, then wife needs to agree to  at least work part time to earn the amount you need to give them.  NTA. Best wishes for resolving this in a peaceful way.", "You sound like a good dude. Ignore these ignorant people who are assuming your wife is a mail order bride / vampire. You\u2019ve explained yourself enough. You gave her family a helping hand when they were desperate. You deserve to be commended for that, not castigated. There was likely no way for you to know how undeserving they would turn out to be. And even if you had an inkling, they were still refugees. People don\u2019t deserve to starve to death for being buttholes. But now that you know, cut them loose. If none of them are willing to work, then they can starve. Which they won\u2019t because they are professional grifters and will find a way to survive, just like they did before they met you.", "Here's what happened: When the war began, I helped his wife and their two kids leave the country. They had to take a non-stop train without any lights during the night. This train took them to Lviv, from where they walked to Poland. They are originally from a city less than an hour's drive from Donetsk, where the war has been ongoing for years, and Russian is the primary language spoken there, not Ukrainian. We were concerned that the Russians would take control of their town within weeks.  \nHe spent a few months at home without work, just relaxing and observing the missiles flying over the city. We managed to get him out by sending money to his friend in Poland, who helped him secure acceptance to a school there for some training. This was sufficient to enable him to leave. Once he arrived in Poland, we applied for him to join the family.", "You're probably right.
