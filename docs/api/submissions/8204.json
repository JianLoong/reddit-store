Tell the school and tell you son's teachers that a bullying is an issue might be at play.  That way when bullying occurs it will be caught from a 3rd party - that is EXACTLY what you want.  Second, and I have to say it, if the stepson is not bullying your son,  that will be seen too.  The school will be the 3rd party either way - this extra set of eyes is important.
