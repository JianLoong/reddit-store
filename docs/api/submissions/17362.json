All that was left was a middle seat, but after the flight out there was so hot and cramped, I decided to go for it.\n\nAs I step onto the plane, I see that there is a middle aged couple (mid 50s?) sitting in row 1, but the woman is sitting in my seat and the husband on the aisle.\n\nI immediately realize that what they did was they purchased the window and the aisle upgrades in hopes that nobody would buy the middle seat, thus giving them the full first row to spread out. It\u2019s 7am, I\u2019m two hours into an adderal, and for some reason I decide on the spot that I\u2019m not letting them choose where I sit on this flight.\n\nThe interaction went something like this:\n\nWife: \u201chere, you can have the window seat!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cno that\u2019s ok, I\u2019d take the aisle seat though.\u201d\n\nWife: \u201cno we are giving you the window seat.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI don\u2019t want the window seat, I\u2019ll take the aisle seat or I\u2019ll sit in my own seat.

[to wife]: I want to sit next to you.\u201d\n\nI went and put my bags in overhead a couple aisles down, came back and offered to sit window. They declined and said it was fine. They looked a little confused at what had just transpired. I put my headphones on and did work on my laptop for the entire flight.\n\nI did kind of feel like a dick, but I found it extremely presumptuous for them to think that they first could 1) pull a fast one by buying the outer seats to deter people from taking the leftover middle, and then 2) assume that they could just shuffle me (or whoever else might have bought the lone ticket) to the window seat without any recourse. \n\nI realize it\u2019s petty, I\u2019m probably at least somewhat the asshole.

Perhaps a little bit dickish but not in the AH territory.", "NTA, although I wonder if they thought they were being kind by offering you the window seat instead of the aisle, and then didn\u2019t know how to react when you declined.\nRegardless, it seems clear that their goal was to occupy the whole row and since that didn\u2019t work out, they should have accommodated you.", "NTA. I would've insisted on the middle seat then man-spread the **whole** time.", "\n\n\nIsn't the window seat normally the more desirable seat? I mean... a window, no getting up for others, you can put your head against the wall... \n\n\n\nI dont think they had bad intentions in asking you to take the window seat.\n\n\nEdit: seems to just be me, who sleeps entire flights and don't want to be bothered \ud83d\ude02\n\nChange do no vote at all.", "Petty definitely but not outright asshole material I'd say esh.", "ESH.\nThem buying aisle and window is not an a-hole mov in itself. People travelling together do it for various reasons (my partner likes to look outside, I like not interacting with ppl every time I get out of my seat). Them wanting to sit together and still doing the split seats is more questionable. Either they should have offered you the aisle or stay in the respective seats.\nYou suck coz you were in a mood and acting like a prick. You did it out of spite and it shows. If where you sit wasn\u2019t such a big deal (window, aisle, middle) then don\u2019t make a big deal out of it at 7am!", "ESH. It's perfectly normal for couples to take the two outer seats and hope nobody takes the middle, so you'rea bit of an AH for assuming anyone would opt for a middle seat when given the opportunity not to. \n\nBut when someone ultimately did take the middle seat, they should have been happy to hand over the aisle if they really wanted to sit together. So they're the AH for being stubborn for that.", "Nta- it\u2019s super nice when in a situation like this to cave, smile and say ok. The issue is everyone seems to think they\u2019re entitled to such a response (which they\u2019re not) and sometimes you just don\u2019t want to give up something and that\u2019s ok!

I'd looked confused too.", "NTA - r/WinStupidPrizes", "Only you know if you were the AH or not. If you genuinely preferred sitting in the middle seat to sitting in the window (which I find hard to believe), then obviously you're well within your rights to keep your seat. If you were trying to punish people because you took issue with where they decided to sit to the point that you would rather sit in a less good seat yourself just to spite them, then, well...\n\nIn your heart of hearts, you already know which it is.", "I think it's weird that you then offered to sit in the window seat at the end. You've got what you wanted. No need to further confuse people.", "Agree, NTA. Here is my booking logic: If my spouse and I book our preferred combo of aisle/middle someone will always book the window as it is a desirable seat for many, no matter how full the flight is. But if the flight has open seats, lots of other rows will have an empty middle still. So we book the aisle and window, and that way if the flight is only part full we have the same odds of an empty middle, but if it is full, we still sit together and someone who would have been stuck in the middle has a better seat. That said, if someone ends up in our middle, we explain we are traveling together and ASK them if the window would be OK...almost everyone is thrilled they don't have the middle anymore and takes the window. If they prefer the aisle, we slide in. It's not that hard.", "I prefer the aisle and always book that if given the chance.", "I love the window seat too\u2026 \n\nI get to sleep uninterrupted or work on my laptop uninterrupted for the entire time. So long as I don\u2019t drink too much liquids, I rarely need to bother anyone else.", "I hate window seats. On cramped planes, due to the curve of the plane, you have less space in the window seat for your legs and any bags that go under the seat. And then you are stuck between a wall and another person. \n\nAisle seat means freedom. I can stretch and crack my knees whenever. It's easy to get up and stretch or just walk. \n\nThough, my husband is like you and prefers windows. But you're both wrong! \ud83d\ude1d", "There isn't a seat I hate more than window seats, I'm the person who has to get up frequently so window seat sucks plus I hate being up against a wall. The simple fact is op didn't want the window seat and also didn't have to switch at all. NTA", "LOL that does not make OP an asshole! Hell, your second point cancels out the first.", "Since when is that normal? So OP is an asshole for not falling for those cheap people\u2019s trick?", "Maybe not normal, but definitely common. I once had a flight like that. Neither one wanted the middle seat but they were happy to spend the whole flight talking to eachother on either side of me.", "No, as I said op is an AH for judging them harshly for it in the first place. Nobody wants the middle, thats why its always the last seat available. \n\nAnyone who doesn't know this one weird trick obvs doesn't travel with partners often. Lol. But the general rule is the couple either sucks it up when someone books the seat between them,  or they give them first pick of whichever good seat they want. \n\nHence, ESH."]}
