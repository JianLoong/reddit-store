But if the flight has open seats, lots of other rows will have an empty middle still. So we book the aisle and window, and that way if the flight is only part full we have the same odds of an empty middle, but if it is full, we still sit together and someone who would have been stuck in the middle has a better seat. That said, if someone ends up in our middle, we explain we are traveling together and ASK them if the window would be OK...almost everyone is thrilled they don't have the middle anymore and takes the window.

It's a common ploy. Aisle and window are both better than middle seat so if you end up in the middle seat and someone does this it's a bonus.\n\nBut at this point, they've started a negotiation.

Why are you angry?", "Up until recently, I would've taken the window.  But the last flight I went on was unbearably hot.  The little air nozzles were only trickling out the tiniest bit of air, and the sun beating through the window made the window seat very very warm.  I could feel the heat radiating off the window.  I sweat through that entire 7 hour flight.  And it was the same on the way back, barely any air coming out of the nozzle vent things.  \n\nIs this standard now? I asked the attendant on the flight back if they could turn the air on and he said it was and that's just how it comes out.  I was flabbergasted, I couldn't feel anything coming out past two inches away from the nozzle.  I remember when those things used to blast a strong jet of air from each one.

If they had said 'hey, we'd like to site together, would you prefer window or aisle?' he'd have been fine with it.

If being two hours into your addy makes you feel extra dickish rather than functional it doesn't sound like you're using it appropriately or may not have even actually had it prescribed. Reason o don't tell people I have adhd and take adderall because inevitably people ask for some for fun or to power through.

They made such a scene to the flight attendants, refused to get out of the aisle, and threatened to sue for discrimination of a person with disabilities (even though they hadn't reached out to the airline for accommodations ahead of time), they just kept insisting that they needed the four seats or to be upgraded. In the end, the frustrated flight attendants upgraded me and my wife to business class for free and the couple flipped out again that we got the upgrade instead of them.", "I disagree, he\u2019s the AH because he\u2019s just being difficult.

But there\u2019s no indication at all that any of this mattered to him, he just appointed himself as Seat Police because he finds the \u201cbuy window and aisle, hope you get the whole row\u201d trick distasteful. \n\nAirplanes are unpleasant enough most of the time. There\u2019s no reason to be a pain in the ass for no reason.", "But he admits at the end that he didn't care about the seat, he just wanted to punish the couple for trying to get the whole row to themselves. I'm more on ESH, the couple shouldn't have argued with him about what seat he could take, but beyond that what they did is very normal and not something that should be punished.

My husband and I don't do that, we just hope the middle seat will be empty and if it's not, oh well, we'll sit in a way that makes our row mate comfortable.\n\nBut anyway, with a baby, I think it's actually sort of courteous to do it that way, because no one wants to sit in a row with a baby anyway if they can avoid it. So if we booked a window and middle, someone might say, ooh, an empty aisle seat, and book it and then be annoyed that they were next to a baby. By booking the window and aisle in the back of the plane, we're doing what we can to steer unsuspecting travelers away from being stuck with us, and if they end up in our row, well, at least we can give them an actual seat that's better than they were expecting. (I do see how the true courteous thing would be to book a full row for ourselves, but $$$.)\n\nI'm glad to hear what you said about preferring the aisle if you were in a row with a baby even though you normally go for window. Since if you DO book a seat for your baby, it's supposed to be the window seat - to protect baby from bumps as people drag stuff down the aisle and also so the baby's not obstructing anyone's exit in an emergency - we were much more comfortable having him by the window on our laps, too.
