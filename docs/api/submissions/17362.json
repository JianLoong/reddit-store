So we book the aisle and window, and that way if the flight is only part full we have the same odds of an empty middle, but if it is full, we still sit together and someone who would have been stuck in the middle has a better seat. That said, if someone ends up in our middle, we explain we are traveling together and ASK them if the window would be OK...almost everyone is thrilled they don't have the middle anymore and takes the window.

It's a common ploy. Aisle and window are both better than middle seat so if you end up in the middle seat and someone does this it's a bonus.\n\nBut at this point, they've started a negotiation.

Why are you angry?", "Up until recently, I would've taken the window.  But the last flight I went on was unbearably hot.  The little air nozzles were only trickling out the tiniest bit of air, and the sun beating through the window made the window seat very very warm.  I could feel the heat radiating off the window.  I sweat through that entire 7 hour flight.  And it was the same on the way back, barely any air coming out of the nozzle vent things.  \n\nIs this standard now? I asked the attendant on the flight back if they could turn the air on and he said it was and that's just how it comes out.  I was flabbergasted, I couldn't feel anything coming out past two inches away from the nozzle.  I remember when those things used to blast a strong jet of air from each one.

You gave them an acceptable alternative.", "NTA  \nthey bought the tickets for their seats, they don't get to choose where anyone else sits", "Nta. I'm impressed that you have adderall, so many shortages here.", "NTA. The middle seat was yours. You were within your rights to have the seat you paid for. If they wanted to strike a bargain, they should be very flexible.", "NTA", "My friend and I book like this usually, and if someone sits in the middle seat, we just continue to sit in the aisle and window and generally not interact much during the flight. We\u2019re gonna hang out for the entire holiday we don\u2019t need to be joined at the hip for the flight.", "NTA at all  \nPeople pull this shit in the cinema too. It happened to me just recently a couple booked 2 seats in the middle while leaving one seat empty next to each other.\n\n  \nThey do that in the hopes to put all their stuff (jacket, bags,...) on the empty seat and also to not have anyone next to them as most people don't go alone to the cinema so why would anyone want to sit all alone next to strangers.\n\nWel surprise! I go alone to the cinema and I made sure she moved all her stuff from my seat!", "ESH. They made a gamble, it\u2019s on them. You wanted aisle one exchange. That\u2019s fine, and it\u2019s your right. You argued, made them move around to get the seat you wanted. Still fine.\n\nBut then you came back and made them move around one more time to get a seat you just argued against? God the \u201cit\u2019s the principle\u201d people are exhausting", "NTA", "NTA\nThough, I don't feel like it's a dick move to gamble by booking the isle and window seats, they were just assholes for thinking they can dictate where others sit. You were doing them a favour by offering to give up the middle seat that you booked so that they can sit together. Either they accept your terms or everyone stays in their assigned seats. Beggar can't be choosers. You were totally justified giving them those 2 options. They were assholes to throw a fit", "NTA They planned ahead, fine. They lost on the luck of reality and expected you to eat it, not fine.", "ESH for power trips", "NTA. This happened to me on multiple legs of my last long trip. Being international flights there would be seats in the center of the plane and someone would try to take my side window seat. A couple tried to beg me to let his kids have the window, but I wasn't trading on an 8 hour flight.", "NTA.  My wife and I usually get aisle seats in the same row.", "Absolutely NTA for all your reasons. I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself.", "YTA. The window is better than the middle. You said no just to be a dick.", "Hey kid stop whacking it in my bathroom.", "EHS", "YTA - not because you wanted to stand your ground or you wanted aisle over window, but because after all that you said you'd take the window. This here shows that all you did was just so you could be an asshole.", "NTA. I probably would have caved. But they were entitled instead of asking respectfully. You're the hero we need.", "NTA these people are super presumptuous. If they want someone to switch seats they should let them pick the aisle or window. \n\nSide note: I don't know on what planet 99% of people think the window seat is better. I think anyone above 5'8\" thinks the aisle seat is better so they have the ability to stretch their legs easily.", "NAH they were a bit blunt about it, but the window seat is the best seat, so I understand their confusion", "NTA. Probably every couple tries this trick. If you get called out, you gladly take your assigned seat. We would never tell someone which seat \u201cwe are giving them\u201d.", "YTA.\n\nWho wouldn't choose a window seat over a middle seat?", "NTA. Not even a little bit.", "NTA. the middle seat trick is a gamble, and since they already lost, they don\u2019t get to decide what the plan B is. they were the ones imposing, so rather than trying to force you, they should\u2019ve just asked something like \u201cwould you mind sitting in \\*either the window or aisle seat\\* so we can sit next to each other?\u201d", "NTA. You backed down, caved and offered to take window, how could you be TA? They decided for you, and that\u2019s rude.", "This. \n\nNTA. They took the risk and lost, so the third person gets choice if they want to be by each other. There\u2019s nothing wrong with what the couple did with regards to how they booked.  The issue is how they acted when it didn\u2019t work.", "We did that all the time and it usually worked with center row seats.\n\nUntil the us forces though it was a good idea to buy the cheapest seats available and stuff their big ass soldiers in the worst seats possible.\n\nTheu guys were all pretty nice but I still would have loved that free centre seat \ud83d\ude05", "I\u2019ve done this before too when I travel with my mom. But she needs the aisle and I\u2019m ok with not sitting next to her so the options are either the person in the middle either gets the window or the middle. Personally I\u2019m ok with either and the passenger that booked the middle seat is never the AH for saying no.", "this is where he lost me", "Right?? Why did you bother putting up a fight at all if you were just going to cave at the end anyway? Makes you look unhinged like you were just being a dick for fun rather than standing up for yourself. \n\nNTA but damn, have some self respect.", "I was so confused by this too. Huh? No wonder they were confused. Either take a stand or don\u2019t. This part just makes him look crazy.", "After reading that I\u2019d hoped the couple would\u2019ve forced him to keep his middle seat.", "That\u2019s ridiculous. They made a selfish bonehead move, then victim decided he wouldn\u2019t take it, and they got butthurt their attempt to manipulate people didn\u2019t work! \n\nA few moments later the victim decides they will actually take the high road. If the couple were confused by someone standing up for themselves followed by decency, that really sucks for them. They should probably be shown as much of that as possible so they can learn how to act.", "My partner and I take the aisle and window because that\u2019s where we are comfortable.  But we\u2019re okay not being right next to each other, and we\u2019re not an ass to whoever gets the middle.  We just avoid interacting so as to not talk over the middle person.", "it\u2019s not to make the middle person uncomfortable lol it\u2019s in hopes no one will purposely buy a middle seat. plus they offered op a better seat", "Works for me about half the time. I rarely take flights less than 6 hrs long so well worth the risk. \n\nWhen it doesn't, the middle seat person has always been excited to switch. We let them choose to which seat though.", "This is what I'm thinking. Sure it's technically within your rights to refuse to move, but OP didn't actually care and it doesn't hurt anything. Besides, it's not that hard to not be a dick about it, whichever option you take.", "[removed]", "I'm tall, so I prefer the aisle seat to stretch my legs out into the aisle.", "I have long legs and creaky knees and sitting in the aisle seat allows me to stretch one of my legs out, and easily stand up to stretch the other one.\n\nHaving said that, on longer flights I tend to prefer the window because I don't go to the toilet as much as most people.", "I think he realized that was the better seat   An aisle seat next to two old people ?? No thanks you\u2019d be getting up 4-5 times during the flight to let them go to the rest room.  Window seat head phones in eyes closed no bother till landing", "Works for me about half the time. I rarely take flights less than 6 hrs long so worth trying. \n\nWhen it doesn't, the middle seat person gets to choose which seat they want though.", "why should they have given a choice from the seats THEY purchased?", "Works for me about half the time. I rarely take flights less than 6 hrs long so well worth trying.", "I mean I can confirm that my personal risk for the gamble has definitely moved more towards the \u201cit not being worth it\u201d more often post-pandemic, but also a lot has changed in our personal world (husband now travels often for work so we have status with an airline, I enjoy interacting with other people less because the past few years seem to have made some people more on edge especially when traveling, etc.) so I am very aware that my opinion is strongly antidotal\u2026", "I mean fair, than your just the person who got the window seat offering it to the person in the middle seat :)", "I think his conscience got the better of him and he decided to take the (fittingly) high road. NTA.", "Yeah, the clue here is when he says, \"my stance is about principle\". So just arguing for the sake of it...", "Sometimes it's fun to be a dick when people deserve it", "lmao hoe was it even selfish though?? they offered him a BETTER seat", "\"victim\"\n\nDude.", "Us too. And we'd both rather have aisle anyway.", "Eh, I think what makes OP a bit of an ass is that he came back after insisting on his seat and offered to do exactly what he earlier denied to do (within his rights ofc). Why make it a whole thing if at the end, you\u2019re just gonna offer to do the thing you made a fuss about in the first place?\n\nDoes it make him an asshole? Probably not(ish), but it\u2019s very weird and almost makes the entire refusal to begin with look childish and power trippy. You can ease off the person you replied to though, you\u2019re being unnecessarily rude and it\u2019s not like the guy defended an abusive spouse or something that would warrant such a harsh response.\n\nOP was not the AH for insisting upon his seat, but it\u2019s murky water once he offers to do the exact thing that was offered to him before he made a fuss.
