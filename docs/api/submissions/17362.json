Either they should have offered you the aisle or stay in the respective seats.\nYou suck coz you were in a mood and acting like a prick. You did it out of spite and it shows.

Here is my booking logic: If my spouse and I book our preferred combo of aisle/middle someone will always book the window as it is a desirable seat for many, no matter how full the flight is. But if the flight has open seats, lots of other rows will have an empty middle still. So we book the aisle and window, and that way if the flight is only part full we have the same odds of an empty middle, but if it is full, we still sit together and someone who would have been stuck in the middle has a better seat. That said, if someone ends up in our middle, we explain we are traveling together and ASK them if the window would be OK...almost everyone is thrilled they don't have the middle anymore and takes the window.

On cramped planes, due to the curve of the plane, you have less space in the window seat for your legs and any bags that go under the seat.

Nobody wants the middle, thats why its always the last seat available. \n\nAnyone who doesn't know this one weird trick obvs doesn't travel with partners often. Lol.

It's a common ploy. Aisle and window are both better than middle seat so if you end up in the middle seat and someone does this it's a bonus.\n\nBut at this point, they've started a negotiation. They want something you have (seats together), you want something they have (aisle seat). Nothing wrong with being pushy in a negotiation.

And if you said neither, they should just drop it immediately. They made a bet, and should accept if they didn't win without making a scene.\n\nMy SO really, really, really can't handle not having an aisle seat, so we each book an aisle in case something happens, we have a better chance of retaining at least one aisle seat.

If it doesn\u2019t, they need to deal with the consequences", "NTA, if you're giving up your seat you can of course negotiate which one you get in exchange.\n\nBut I'm so confused why you're so pissed at this.

Why are you angry?", "Up until recently, I would've taken the window.  But the last flight I went on was unbearably hot.  The little air nozzles were only trickling out the tiniest bit of air, and the sun beating through the window made the window seat very very warm.  I could feel the heat radiating off the window.  I sweat through that entire 7 hour flight.  And it was the same on the way back, barely any air coming out of the nozzle vent things.  \n\nIs this standard now? I asked the attendant on the flight back if they could turn the air on and he said it was and that's just how it comes out.  I was flabbergasted, I couldn't feel anything coming out past two inches away from the nozzle.  I remember when those things used to blast a strong jet of air from each one.  It mentioned this to some people and they all asked what airline and when I told them it was American, they all seemed to think that's why.", "NTA.", "NTA. they can either sit apart for the short flight or give you the seat you want if they insist on taking your seat.

I always have to get up to pee, often more than once (if it's a long flight, for certain) and I hate having to ask someone to get up for me or I get anxious if they're going to fall asleep and trap me.
