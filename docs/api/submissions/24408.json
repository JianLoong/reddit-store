You are married to her father so stopping by your house seems pretty normal. \n\nWhy is Kalie so desperate to have a mother/daughter relationship with you? Kalie\u2019s behavior is not \u201ctypical\u201d for a 34 yo woman. Leads me to believe there\u2019s a part of the story that\u2019s missing.\n\nAppears you\u2019re NTA but what does your husband think about your response?", "NTA\n\nSeems pretty obvious to me that one of two things is true here. \n1- She has serious mental issues with the loss of her mother and father in a \"family unit\" that she needs to sort out in therapy.\nor\n2- She doesn't like you (possibly resents you because she hasn't gotten over the divorce yet and sees you as trying to replace her father's wife), and she knows what she's doing bothers you, so she's going to keep doing it to intentionally piss you off.", "NTA. You've told her multiple times that calling you \"mom\" makes you uncomfortable, and husband has made it clear to her as well that this is not appropriate. She should stop. \n\nThis is outside the realm of the question, I guess, but I find it odd that someone of that age is looking so hard to make that bond.", "NTA - This is odd behavior. You have made it clear you want an adult relationship with them.", "NTA. I think this is odd behavior too.", "Honestly, I feel like nobody's the asshole here, but depends on certain factors.\n\nOk, so you say that the ex wife still has a good relationship with your husband, but you never mentioned if she has a good relationship with her children, in particular Kalie. \n\nIt feels to me like Kalie does not have such a good relationship with her mother and has somehow not managed to resolve this issue of her parents being split, so she's still missing a \"mother-figure\". As you married her dad, she felt like you could be her mother figure. \n\nMost of all, she's looking for a friend and a confidant that's of her gender, because she can't talk about sex life with her dad. \n\nWhile she's not really your daughter, she has become your step-daughter, so she is part of the family. I think the fact that she calls you \"mom\" has made you snappy towards her, which is understandable in a way as you dislike that, but it doesn't solve the underlying issue. She wants to know that she can trust you and treats you like part of the family in her own weird way, but you're pushing her away. \n\nIn this case I think that you need to talk to her directly and explain to her that you don't feel comfortable with her calling you \"mom\" because you're not her actual mom and you don't want to replace her biological mother. You can also be her friend and give her advice from time to time, especially on \"girl stuff\", since she might not get anyone else to ask advice from on that. \n\nI know my \"judgement\" was not very clear, but I feel like the situation is not very clear either because I don't understand the relationship between Kalie and you (excluding the \"mom\" stuff) and between Kalie and her actual biological mother.", "There's something wrong here... This is strangely the opposite of your typical AITA post.", "It feels like before someone becomes a step parent they need to pass out a questionnaire to find out what their step kids are looking for.", "She isn\u2019t your \u201cstepdaughter,\u201d she\u2019s your actual stepdaughter. When you married your man, you married into his family, and his family became your family. You can absolutely decide with your husband when she comes over and when she visits, but you can\u2019t do anything about her calling you mom but explain it makes you uncomfortable, and \u201cyou would like time to warm up to the idea,\u201d even if that time never comes and you both know it. \n\nYour stepdaughter does sound pretty intense and I have no doubt it\u2019s uncomfortable, but from what you described she isn\u2019t being mean, just socially inept.", "Sounds like a bad horror movie", "Total opposite here.

Bonus grandbabies call me grandma & I love it because kids are to be loved no matter what the relationship.

I know it's semantics, but still.  My husband's mom married her husband when my husband was in his 30's.

Im a stepmom also but its different cz they were kids when I married their dad.  So Im also mom or some variation of that, sometimes my 1st name or our nicknames for each other(sweetface or sweetcakes lol) and I love them like my own. There is no division for us with step and they for sure dont call their brothers 1/2 siblings. They are adults now and my girls call me everyday and it makes my heart full but I had 20 years to build that OP and the daughter dont even really know each other.

Regardless of the daughter\u2019s age she wants that type of relationship with op.", "Oh it was super awkward at first. And we both made missteps that were uncomfortable. Also, we have very different strongly held beliefs on a couple of hot topics. Sometimes one or both of us would slip up and still discuss (disagree) these topics, even though we had a boundary to not do so. But I never had the level of resentment that I read in this post.

If the daughter was still a child then OP would be TA because you dont marry someone who is still raising kids and not want to be a parent. \n\nHowever OP married someone with adult children and she just wants an adult relationship not a mother/daughter one. She already has a mother and unless that relationship is trash its really odd she is pushing the mom thing with OP. \n\nIt would make more sense if she never had a mom or their relationship is strained but even then she should respect OPs decision and build a bond that works for both of them. They could have a great relationship and grow to love each other and maybe those feelings will form for OP but also maybe not, now though OP is so put off who knows if they can have any relationship at all.", "Yea I agree but I think the resentment comes from the daughter stomping on OPs boundries. I feel like theres still time to fix it and have a good relationship even if not a mother/daughter one. \n\nThe dad keeps talking to his daughter but I think OP should sit down with her and really ask her why she is so insistant on calling her mom or why she\u2019s pushing the relationship so hard and fast.

She had only interacted with her 4 times by the time the wedding came so its odd she made such a speech and she\u2019s been talked to multiple times so why does she keep pushing instead of trying to build the relationship she wants it just doesnt make sense. \n\nOP said in a comment the dad and mom have talked about it and no one understands why the daughter is acting this way. They can salvage it though but a real conversation with OP and the daughter needs to happen or there will never be a good relationship.", "What's wrong with calling an equal a nice lady?", "I have no clue.

Especially the ex spouse of their current partner. \n\nI have never once seen a woman refer to another woman as a lady in this context.

Their bio was actually the one that wanted them to call me mom too because she didnt think calling me my 1st name was respectful. I explained it was fine for me and now as adults sometimes Im my name, sometimes mom/mother, sometimes sweetface cz thats what I call them too.\n\nBlending families can be hard I have a step mom that came into my life and married my dad 1 month before I myself got married. She\u2019s not my mom in anyway and I would never call her that, she\u2019s my dads wife.

Regardless of them being adults it still affects them.", "Then look at the profile. You think a 50 year old woman made a Reddit account to post this? Are you that dense? Is it exhausting not being able to connect those dots?", "11 siblings whew Im tired for those parents lol. Yes I talked to them and thats why I think OP should talk to her and find out whats really going on. Im sure it affects them especially if they are close with their dad. It didnt affect me at all but Im not super close to my dad I actually like his wife more than him. \n\nIt does affect adult children though because the girls bio mom just got remarried again(same guy twice lol) and the 25 year old is not all that happy about it so she is moving out of her moms place into her own. She doesnt care to have a father/daughter relationship with him but she does respect him and his love for her mom. She\u2019ll never call him dad and she\u2019s known him for about 12 years now and they just never had that kind of connection."]}
