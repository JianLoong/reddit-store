I have never heard of this or seen this in any other country. In order to use the elevator you need to put 1 lari into a machine for the elevator to work which is about 37 cents. Usually you only need to pay to go up but in my building its both up and down. Georgia is a very poor country so 37 cents is actually a lot of money, the average monthly salary is about 800 dollars but many people earn less than 400 dollars a month. If they use the elevator twice a day every month thats 22.2 dollars, so that can be 5,5% of a monthly salary. Because of this most people just walk but some people in my apartment building are very old or are disabled, those people on pensions are only getting a few hundred dollars a month.\r  \n\r  \nI think this is really disgusting but the company who manages our building justifies it saying its for maintenance costs. Some buildings in Georgia look like the kowloon city wall, very shoddily built, people build illegal and unregulated extensions on them. My apartment building has a hole in it where I can see my neighbors below me. We avoid stepping on certain areas because a new hole could form and we'd fall through the ceiling. They've made some renovations but I think they're keeping a lot of this elevator money for themselves.\r  \n\r  \nI felt bad for an old man who lost a leg from a war and he has asked me for lari to use the elevator. There's other people who struggle too. I'm an electrical engineering student so for me to jury rigg/hotwire (whatever its in English) to override the pay function wasn't too hard. The elevator is 60 years old so I was worried I'd fuck it up.  We went on like this for about a month or 2 before the company that manages it seemed to notice, I guess they only collect the money once a month. They eventually discovered one day that there was barely any money left and the elevator had been tampered with. They were fucking pissed and they sent every room a notice saying they will fine whoever did this with 5000 lari (some bullshit number probably) for the lost revenue and another 2500 for repair costs. Nobody thankfully snitched on me, everyone knows its me.\r  \n\r  \nThey disabled the elevator now while they're \"repairing\" it and it has been unusable for the past week. Some residents are pissed off at me now saying they can't use the elevator and now i screwed everyone over and in hindsight, what I did might have been foolish as this seems to have backfired. Some resident's friend is a lawyer and he decided to sue the company over this as there are people who are unable to leave their homes. \r  \n\r  \nI got into an argument with my family over this as they said my actions negatively impacted everyone else and i need to think about long term consequences.

You should think long and hard about what you did and how it was wrong, and make a promise that you'll never make such a horrible mistake in the future.

After-all, they would have been hard pressed to take action if they hadn't seen your bypass work. A successful bypass would have been undetectable without significant work on their part, leaving them to think that people were just not using the elevator. It would also probably require some knowledge of the computer system running the elevator so that you could ensure that it wasn't providing a log of unpaid use and the floors being exploited.  \nCongratulations on finding out that \"red team\" actions tend to be up against a \"blue team\". Now that the blue team knows you exist, your next attempt will be more difficult. Look for cameras and other detection methods.", "YTA. But not because of robin hooding. Because of safety. You are a STUDENT, not the actual engineer for now. No one checked what you did and this pure elevator was already 60 years old. There was very good chance you messed up and this elevator had a chance to fall down at any moment during this month. With people inside. There is safety protocols and testing for a reason.\nYou know I\u2019m right, because you thought yourself that after your changes it will not work at all.\nBtw, google what happened to Louis Slotin. This is what happens when you do very simple thing, that you did hundreds of times before and not taking safety protocols seriously.\nAlso, most likely company put the elevator out of order, cause it\u2019s legally not allowed to run it after unauthorized work without complex check up", "YTA.

Maybe the landlord is acting in bad faith here, or maybe the cost of maintaining the building has increased due to other economic forces and now rents are no longer enough to cover it.  \n\nThis is basically a use tax, just like a toll road.  The amount of repair and maintenance an elevator needs directly correlates with how much use it gets.  If you charge on a per-use basis, the people who cannot afford (or don\u2019t want) to pay for it can take the stairs, while those who want to use the elevator can pay for its upkeep.  \n\nThe problem is that some people need to elevator (eg, people with disabilities who don\u2019t live on the first floor), and then they end up disproportionately bearing the cost of something they have no choice but to use.  But the flip side is that if you spread it out to everyone equally, someone else who doesn\u2019t need the elevator may be forced out of their home because they can\u2019t afford it anymore.

There is no \u201clandlord\u201d in such houses - flats are privately owned.
