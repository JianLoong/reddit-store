Decide carefully whose side you want to take with this.", "So does op if she attends.", "My sister's bio children were invited, their names were on the invitation, just not her stepdaughter's. My brother has no stepkids and my brother's invitation just said ''family (last name)\". So from this, I'm assuming yes.", "If the step-son isn't family, doesn't that technically mean that OP's husband isn't really family either. They both got into the family through marriage, not by blood.", ">My husband was understandably very upset and will not be attending the wedding.\n\nI think it's pretty clear what his thoughts are.", "Agree with everything except the N A H. Cousin is clearly TA", "Ah yes, cover up something completely reasonable and extremely common with a cruel, drama-creating and completely unnecessary excuse which is now putting multiple familial and marital relationships in jeopardy and is specifically hurtful to the young children of the family. Makes perfect sense.", "Utterly missed the point", "what in the world are you yappin about??", "The cousin invited the sisters bio children but refused the step child because they aren\u2019t real family. Same thing to op, op\u2019s step kid wasn\u2019t invited. I get \u201cno kid\u201d weddings or if there were issues but this bride is purposely leaving out step kids. OP is an AH if she goes because that means she is allowing and accepting that disgusting behavior.", "Husband is mad and will not attend. Neither will OP\u2019s sister, whose bio kids were invited but not her stepdaughter. I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that OP attending will severely affect her relationship with the stepson and the husband.", "Sure we do. Steps not invited because they are not family. If she goes she is agreeing with that sentiment. Quite easy to read.", "Some family's you don't have to be blood related.", "Neither are cousins. Or the kids of cousins. Or the spouses of cousins. But all of them are invited with the exception of the two stepkids, who are living with and being raised, at least partially, by their stepparents.\n\nEDIT: And the cousin didn't say only \"close\" family. The cousin said \"family only.\" The stepkids are family.", "Op wants to attend the wedding.", "How does it not?", "I'm trying to imagine having a relative that was this much TA.   I truly can not fathom it.", "I\u2019m guessing her sister didn\u2019t tell her step-daughter why they\u2019re not going.  No need to put that onto a kid.", "For context, I was that kid. Decades later I remember all of it. These kids will remember not just the cousin being like this but the parent for making that decision too.", "I married a man and now I have a step son.\n\nI cannot imagine if someone in my family told me he couldn't come because he \"isn't family.\" If I'm invited, he is as well. Because I married a man with a son... I feel like it's a pretty simple concept. \n\nIt's a step son. Not a step-not-son", "Nope, you gotta leave a table with the divorce papers stacked neatly on top.", "No, keep the house, put their stuff in the drive way.", "YES! THIS!!!!", "I don't think PP meant 'family things' as an airy excuse. I think it was meant as a pointed barb - I can't come because I have famy things to do with MY FAMILY. You know, my husband and stepchild, my family.", "Yep, no lies. Tell her straight that she's cruel.", "Oh if she goes I hope she comes home to divorce papers.", "Might actually cause a rift with her sister as she\u2019s be validating her niece\u2019s exclusion.", "OP & her sister should do a family thing that day, with their step kids. And never speak to this cousin again.", "So you\u2019re basically telling your husband that it\u2019s ok for his son not to be considered part of your family. If you seriously plan to go to the wedding you\u2019re just as awful as your cousin.", "Well, this information simply clarifies what an asshole your cousin is, and IMO YTA if you go and support her. It\u2019s certainly your right to attend an asshole\u2019s wedding, but I\u2019m sure your husband would be justifiably hurt if you do so.  Is she worth it?", "You may want to support your cousin, but she is not supporting you or your family. She has drawn multiple Iines in the sand. Your sister is doing the right thing, she's choosing her family. You should choose your or risk ruining your marriage.\nQuestion...Do YOU consider your step son family?", "Knowing this, you still want to go to this monster's wedding? Why? Do you agree with her? If you go, you would definitely be TA.", "You go to the wedding and your marriage is over. I would divorce you in a heart beat. YTA", "You need to speak with your husband. \n\nI don't think you are the AH for wanting to go, but your cousin is an AH. All of the kids but the two stepkids are invited? That's an AH move. Your sister being expected to leave one kid at home while her siblings and parents (or parental figures) go to a family event is pretty terrible on the part of your cousin. She either accepts the kids in the family or she doesn't. \n\nThose of you with stepchildren are setting the precedent for how your children are treated in the future with how you respond to things like this. You don't need to make a stink but not accepting invitations when one of your children is left off of the invite sends a string message.", "It's women like you who give the rest of us a bad name.  Of course YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE.", "Why do you want to support a bigot like that?", "Nope stay Way that is a huge asshole move.", "You should probably use your sister as your role model until you get the hang of this whole stepmother thing.\n\nIt seems like you got the step part down but you\u2019re not grasping the mother part.\n\nYTA, unless you\u2019re going for the Disney stereotype.\n\nNever mind. That\u2019s an even bigger YTA.", "[removed]", "Well then I hope your husband ends up having sense and leaving you and your horrible family.", "Wow your cousin is a gigantic a-hole and so are you if you go.", "I bet your sister and husband rightfully looks at you different after this.", "Then do what you think is correct.", "The thing is, a lot of people would rather have others see them as assholes than someone with \u201cpoor\u201d or questionable finances.", "How long have they been married?  I do think its not quite as cut and dried as that.  If you've known one child since they were a baby, and met another child twice over the last 2 years, I do think acting like they are the exact same is a bit unrealistic.  Again, wedding venues have limits, and people have budgets.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean its automatically fine either.  I'm just saying I can think of shades of grey.  I was an only child, then my mom married someone with 3 kids.  i can easily see how a more distant relative would be ok with me coming, but not have space for 3 other kids they barely knew.", "Legally speaking there's no family relationship there at all unless an adoption takes place.", "Same lol my fam is faaar from perfect but step kids are literally treated identical to all the other kids. I was also like 20 years old when I realized that one of my aunts actually isn't my grandmother's kid but rather a kid my grandpa had out of wedlock because you just could not tell by anyone's behaviour lol", "I also can't imagine how you could be related to that big of an asshole and be willing to condone their assholery by leaving your partner and step-child at home so you can show you're 'there for' the asshole", "They exist. My aunt bought a Christmas gift for my one year old bioson, but not my 10 year old stepson. I called, assuming it was a mistake, and even offered to buy a gift and say it was from her. She refused, so we returned the gift unopened. Some years later we met her by chance while visiting my grandmother on the other side, and she gave my bioson some money as a Christmas present, but not my stepson. I have barely spoken to her in 20 years.", "Could be. But a move like cousin's should be directly called out.

Despite the step children primarily living with those parents. It didn\u2019t just happen to op, it was many people in the family. That sends a clear message. It\u2019s not about space or kid free or anything other than the bride being an AH. And OP would also be an AH if she participated in allowing this narrative to happen around her child.", "Since when is family only about legal status?? This is such an absurd take haha", "My mom threw a TANTRUM when someone made a distinction about there being a difference between my brothers step daughters and his \u201creal kids.\u201d She went OFF about anyone daring to deny they are her grand babies.

So that excuses it.", "It\u2019s her wedding she can invite whoever she wants", "I mean, as someone who was part of a blended family, I think I'm in a pretty good place to say its no black and white. \n\nI was 9 when my mom got married.  I can't imagine if my step dad's cousin, someone I barely knew, was getting married and my step brothers were invited, that I'd be super bothered by it.", "Being able to do what she wants and being an AH are not mutually exclusive.", "Yeah but it\u2019s her wedding, she can have friendly relation with the stepson without seeing him as family. She doesn\u2019t have to include or view him as part of her family. It\u2019s up to the cousin to decide if she wants to go or no"]}
