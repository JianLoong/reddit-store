Teeth don't do any good if you inhale a grape and it gets lodged in your throat.", "Children may have all of their baby teeth by 2 but they certainly don\u2019t have permanent teeth yet. And choking risk is not solely based on how many teeth they have. From the American academy of pediatrics (AAP considers early childhood to be through age 8):\n\n\u201cMolars are required for chewing and grinding food and do not erupt until approximately 1.5 years of age. However, mature mastication abilities take longer to develop and remain relatively incomplete throughout early childhood. Young children and children with developmental and neurologic impairment also do not have the overall cognitive skills, behavioral control, or experience to chew well and eat slowly.\n\nDespite a strong gag reflex, a young child's airway is more vulnerable to obstruction than that of an adult in several ways. The smaller diameter is more likely to experience significant blockage by small foreign bodies. Resistance to air flow is inversely related to the radius of the airway to the fourth power, so even small changes in the cross-section of the airway of a young child can lead to dramatic changes in airway resistance and air flow. Mucus and secretions around a foreign body in the airway will reduce the radius of the airway even further and may also form a seal around the foreign body, making it more difficult to dislodge by forced air, such as with a cough or Heimlich maneuver. The force of air generated by a cough in an infant or young child is less than that in an adult; therefore, a cough may be less effective in dislodging a complete or partial airway obstruction during early childhood.\u201d", "Not to mention the running/ jumping/ rolling/ dancing plus being distracted by every leaf/colour/light and bloody atom in existence when you are trying to get them to just sit down and eat.
