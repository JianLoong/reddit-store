They canceled my card right away and started an investigation. While this was going on, I noticed that not only did this scammer use my credit card, they also signed me up for just about every spam email on the planet. I had 400 emails in 5 minutes. My guess is so that they could hide the confirmation email for the purchase and I wouldn\u2019t notice. Well lucky for me I\u2019m anal about this stuff and deleted every email while ensuring that I was looking at all of the titles, email address and the like and saw the confirmation email for the purchase. I changed my email password right away as well so this fraudster couldn\u2019t get in. I\u2019m the confirmation email from the purse company, was their phone number. I called them right away and let them know I did not order this and it was fraud. I asked them to cancel the order and make sure that they didn\u2019t send it. Well today I got a shipping notification that the purse is indeed on its way. I called the shipping company and changed it to ship to my address and added a security word so no one else can change the address. I feel like I have done my due diligence with the company letting them know it was fraud and not to send it. WIBTA if I kept the purse when it comes and sell it to compensate my time and aggravation over all this?\n\nUpdate Edit: For those asking, I don\u2019t know why they used my legit email address, clearly they\u2019re new to this and they didn\u2019t use my extract address, they used an empty lot on my street. I did contact the purse company and I have let them know about the shipping error. The are contacting the shipper to see if they can get it returned and if not, I will use the return sticker in the box to return the product. \n\nY\u2019all were right about me being petty about this as I was acting out of spite since this whole thing has been a bloody nightmare and trying to get all rectified has cost me countless hours.

I get the frustration but it seems more trouble than it\u2019s worth.", "Of course YTA, now you are stealing", "YTA period.  They will know that the purse was shipped and the address updated.

Since it arrived in a box that is good for shipping, you don't even have to repack it - most Fedex (or equivalent shipping places) have boxes where you can place boxes with prepaid lablels.
