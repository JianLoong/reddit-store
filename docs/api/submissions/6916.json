While this was going on, I noticed that not only did this scammer use my credit card, they also signed me up for just about every spam email on the planet. I had 400 emails in 5 minutes. My guess is so that they could hide the confirmation email for the purchase and I wouldn\u2019t notice. Well lucky for me I\u2019m anal about this stuff and deleted every email while ensuring that I was looking at all of the titles, email address and the like and saw the confirmation email for the purchase. I changed my email password right away as well so this fraudster couldn\u2019t get in. I\u2019m the confirmation email from the purse company, was their phone number. I called them right away and let them know I did not order this and it was fraud. I asked them to cancel the order and make sure that they didn\u2019t send it. Well today I got a shipping notification that the purse is indeed on its way. I called the shipping company and changed it to ship to my address and added a security word so no one else can change the address. I feel like I have done my due diligence with the company letting them know it was fraud and not to send it. WIBTA if I kept the purse when it comes and sell it to compensate my time and aggravation over all this?\n\nUpdate Edit: For those asking, I don\u2019t know why they used my legit email address, clearly they\u2019re new to this and they didn\u2019t use my extract address, they used an empty lot on my street. I did contact the purse company and I have let them know about the shipping error. The are contacting the shipper to see if they can get it returned and if not, I will use the return sticker in the box to return the product. \n\nY\u2019all were right about me being petty about this as I was acting out of spite since this whole thing has been a bloody nightmare and trying to get all rectified has cost me countless hours.

Wrong.\n\n But when the bank contact the vendor of the purse and realise that its been diverted to your home address. The bank will realise you've committed fraud.\n\nThey will stop any refunds to you, and pass your details to the police.", "YWBTA. Don't be as bad as the thieves that stole from you.", "YWBTAH if you didn\u2019t return the pocketbook, not to mention you would probably be opening your self up to a criminal investigation.", "WBTA.

Don't keep something that does not rightfully belong to you.\n\nThat said... When the purse arrives, (and not a minute before), contact the retailer, explain what happened and ask them to provide a shipping label to return it; you should not have to pay to return it. They may offer you a gift card as a \"reward\". They may also just tell you to keep it, (unlikely, given the cost, but you never know). If they don't pay for the shipping, then you have done all you can and, imo, would be justified in keeping it.", "YWBTA \n\nAnd you would be breaking the law. The purse isn't yours to sell.

Why would they use your email address to order something rather than a throwaway email? \n\nYWBTA", "Pretty sure the credit card company can make you pay for the so called \"fraud\" purchase if they find out you knowingly had the purse sent to your address with the intention of keeping it. That is, if this happened.  If someone stole your credit card number,  they would use their own email address for purchases. And if you indeed reported the purchase as fraud, the purse company wouldn't have sent the purse and certainly wouldn't have let you change the address (especially if it had already shipped to a different address) to your address knowing they weren't getting paid for it.", "YWBTA...Don't fight fraud with fraud. You know how it feels to be victimized in this way.  Just do the right thing.", "YWBTA. Do you have to sign for this shipment? I would expect something that expensive would require a signature.

Tell them the fraudulent order has been dispatched, and ask what you can do if it arrives on your doorstep.\n\nCover your rear, OP.", "YTA- if that's all you do. You did a lot of work to correct what was stolen from you, and kudos to you, however if you receive the purse and don't do anything else yta. If you receive the purse and then email the purse company and let your credit card company know that you received the purse and ask them what you should do, that would be the best path forward.\n\nBecause at the end of the day... neither the purse company nor the credit card company will do anything to get the purse returned. In credit card fraud, it doesn't work that way. 90% chance that you send your emails asking to return it and nothing will happen, you wait 90 days, you have a free purse.", "YWBTA - you know it\u2019s fraud. Contact the company to send it back when/if it arrives.", "While you have done everything you should, the process may have been too far along to cancel. Keeping the purse would be morally wrong and illegal. You gave the company all of the information they need to file charges. YWBTA", "So just clarify something for me, who do you expect to pay for the purse if you're not willing to pay for it yourself?", "YWBTA and you would be opening yourself up for some damages when the credit card company starts investigating the fraud claim.  No, you didn't make the purchase, but you did intercept the delivery and they are going to see that.  If you keep the purse, or resell it, they are almost guaranteed going to send you the bill for it.\n\nDon't play chicken with the credit card company, if you lose, you will pay dearly.", "YWBTA\n\nTaking things you didn't pay for is stealing.  You're 34.  You know this.  Rationalizing it because of your \"time and aggravation\" is a little pathetic.  The person who stole your information isn't going to get the purse, and that's a good thing.  But either refuse delivery when it arrives at your address, or pay for it.", "I'm not saying YWBTA, but me personally I'd feel wrong about holding onto it immediately.\n\nI'd personally keep it in its original packaging and wait for the company to respond, if they don't respond within a month giving you the information to ship it back I wouldn't feel bad about keeping it, but from the way you tell the story it sounds like there was a lag time in your reporting and the shipment of the purse that would have made it impossible for the company to cancel the shipment in time.\n\nNTA, but I'd say it's just a little unethical to keep something that expensive!", "Technically YWBTA because that would be fraud. I get the frustration but it seems more trouble than it\u2019s worth.", "Of course YTA, now you are stealing", "YTA period.  They will know that the purse was shipped and the address updated.  Return the purse and make sure to getting tracking info to ensure it was returned.", "YWBTA\n\nYou would then also be committing fraud.", "YTA\nYou need to return things when you also got the money back. It's frustrating that they misused your credit card like this, but you should mitigate the damage in a legal way.", "YWBTA", "Check all of your shopping apps and any websites that have your credit card information saved - particularly if you have multiple CCs saved. They may have hacked into one of these accounts, rather than your credit card info itself - and that's why the confirmation email went to your email address. They likely would not have been able to use the saved CC info if they changed your email address first, since that type of change sometimes forces a reset of saved CC info.", "I would give them an opportunity to get it back within a reasonable window (maybe one week) provided that caused you zero work/effort. If they fail, NTA.  You did more than you had to do to prevent the fraud.", "Personally, I would return the purse. Sometimes it's too late to cancel shipping. It's not a good look to call in a fraud charge but then keep the purse. YTA", "Not really TA but taking the purse is kind of a scummy move, especially when the company\u2019s not at fault.\n\nI\u2018m also pretty sure they\u2019re not just gonna forget about a $4500 purse and will probably contact you to get it back.\n\nNTA and if I were you I\u2019d just return the purse, it seems more trouble than it\u2019s worth.", "YWBTA- obviously! That would be fraud. You don't get to have any compensation from an innocent bag company... are you serious??", "A very soft YTA.\nI understand the frustration but the company can evidence that it sent the product to YOUR address and that YOU have received it. Not the fraudy mcFraudster. Make sure you evidence sending the bag back and let your bank do their investigations. Have you reported this to the police? If Fraudy mcFraudster is stupid enough to ship something to their address?", "The legality of what you are planning is questionable. The item was technically stolen since it was purchased through fraudulent means, and instead of return it to the rightful owners you want to sell it.", "NTA per se as you are the victim of a crime but this isn't like finding $20 on the floor. This could open you up to problems as they are investigating it - wherein it turns out the 'stolen' product paid with a 'stolen' card ends up at your address? How does that look? You would be expected to return it when received, otherwise you probably would be YTA.", "YTA and committing a criminal act which would be theft.\n\nFor that large a purchase, the chances are that the store and the credit card company will work together in order to determine where the bag was shipping - and your address as well as your use of the sign in will show up.\n\nSomeone in shipping screwed up. It happens but it isn't justification for stealing $4500. Call them up when it arrives and ask them to give you one of the Fedex or equivalent labels so that you pay nothing for the return. Since it arrived in a box that is good for shipping, you don't even have to repack it - most Fedex (or equivalent shipping places) have boxes where you can place boxes with prepaid lablels. Fedex will even come to your home for pickup if that is more convenient for you but dropping it off at a box is simpler for me /", "NTA but I'm pretty sure that is illegal.
