We couldn't find a convenient time for meeting in person and I agreed to do a porch pick up and left a wooden box on the porch along with the guitar. He came and went taking the guitar but he only left a $20 bill. He did not respond to me when I messaged him about his payment being short, but 2 days after he picked up the guitar he messaged me saying that the guitar needs more repairs (it doesn't) and asked when I would be available for them to return the guitar for a refund. Completely ignoring the entire \"did not pay for it in full\". I don't want the guitar, I want my money owed.

If you have a ring doorbell, make sure he doesn\u2019t show up at your house. If he does, call the police and cite trespassing.

Uh, no.", "This is like when people leave out a full bowl of candy and say only take one lmao", "NTA. Hello karma!", "If he comes back with the guitar,  you could give him 10back. Keep 10 for wasting your time & a \"restock\" fee...", "NTA and you should know it. Dude this is a scam and you\u2019re being a dumbass in this whole process. Cut your losses and just end it", "That\u2019s a good way to stop you from hounding them for the rest. They are probably scamming you. Soft ESH. Tell them sure and get it back while only refunding half.", "NTA yes this is the risk of selling, especially with a porch pickup.
