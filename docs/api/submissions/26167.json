It\u2019s out of town, about an 8 hour drive, and she expects us to pay $1k to stay at the venue for 4 nights. This already involves both of us using vacation time on thurs/fri.  On top of that, we have to sleep on a futon couch, sharing the room with our 12 year old niece. I was willing to do that, but then started talking about bringing a pack n play for our baby. She asked if I was planning to have someone travel with us to watch the baby while we stayed. I told her no, as we wouldn\u2019t need anyone to watch her, except for during the ceremony, in which case there is plenty of family there to hold her. She told me it is a kid free venue and I can\u2019t bring the baby (her niece); not to the wedding, or to stay at the venue. I said I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving my child for 5 days, and she just said oh, well\u2026she can\u2019t come. Of course I wouldn\u2019t mind if it was just for the wedding day, and I got a sitter for the day. But the fact that she wants us to stay at the venue for 5 days, pay quite a bit for the lodging, and leave my 8 month old at home 8 hours away is a bit insane to me. What do y\u2019all think?\n\n** edit for clarification: the venue allows children. She does not want them there. Expect for her other niece, who is 12. Her parents will be staying in the next room of the suite-type accommodation, in the main bedroom.", "created_utc": 1693801067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169hsmt/aita_for_not_wanting_to_leave_my_8_month_old_baby/", "score": 1072, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where are the 12 year olds parents and why can\u2019t she stay with them?! But also the bride can\u2019t dictate where you stay either. It was her choice to pay $60k for a venue\u2026it\u2019s unbelievable she\u2019s expecting others to pitch in for her wedding. The entitlement of this woman is incredible.\n\nLastly, why do you need to be there for 5 days?! And could you possibly say to her that sorry, that\u2019s not possible.

Apologize for any inconvenience caused but you have to put the needs of your completely dependent upon your care child above sils desire for you all to do 5+ days for her child free wedding.

On top of that, leaving your child with someone for that many days when they aren\u2019t even a year old is a lot, at least for me. What does your husband think of all this since it\u2019s his sister? I am always of the opinion that people are entitled to having a child-free wedding, but they need to expect and understand that there will be people who either won\u2019t attend, or won\u2019t be present for longer than the day of the wedding, because of it.\n\nEditing to add: why is their niece attending if there\u2019s no children allowed, and why are YOU having to room with her instead of her being with her parents?", "NTA.

If she has to stay with you instead of her own parents for some reason, she can & should sleep on the futon. I understand wanting a child free wedding, but you can\u2019t then be upset when families with children can\u2019t make it.

It\u2019s out of town, about an 8 hour drive, and she expects us to pay $1k to stay at the venue for 4 nights. This already involves both of us using vacation time on thurs/fri.  On top of that, we have to sleep on a futon couch, sharing the room with our 12 year old niece. I was willing to do that, but then started talking about bringing a pack n play for our baby. She asked if I was planning to have someone travel with us to watch the baby while we stayed. I told her no, as we wouldn\u2019t need anyone to watch her, except for during the ceremony, in which case there is plenty of family there to hold her. She told me it is a kid free venue and I can\u2019t bring the baby (her niece); not to the wedding, or to stay at the venue. I said I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving my child for 5 days, and she just said oh, well\u2026she can\u2019t come. Of course I wouldn\u2019t mind if it was just for the wedding day, and I got a sitter for the day. But the fact that she wants us to stay at the venue for 5 days, pay quite a bit for the lodging, and leave my 8 month old at home 8 hours away is a bit insane to me.

Give him a few minutes and he's all smiles, but man, he does not want to be addressed.", "Then you walk out of the ceremony with them.\n\nI'm ok with child free weddings and events.  But when kids cry at public events you get up and remove them until they stop being a disruption.\n\nAnd sometimes you miss a significant portion of the event, but those are tge tradeoffs.", "Nobody is worried about the ceremony. Bride wants op without baby for 5 days", "Oh yeah a baby crying can make everyone stop giving attention to the bride and stare at the kid.", "Yeah, if I\u2019m in a wedding and I choose to select the hotel, great.  I\u2019ve been a wedding party where it is substantial more then other major hotel chains/night and have stayed in the closest or cheaper one. I don\u2019t expect them to paid my hotel, but don\u2019t demand I stay there if my finances can\u2019t take it.", "And pay 1k for this \"privilege\".", "It could be one of those rooms that a meant for families, parents get the queen sized bed and there\u2019s a pullout/futon for the kids.  I have a feeling OP never asked why, because she froze with shock, because this is ridiculous.", "It's not free. It's going to cost them $1000 to share a room with a 12 year old and sleep on a futon. \n\nNTA...\n\nFind the cost for staying overnight, or 2, in your own room, or a hotel nearby. Can you bring an in-law to help watch the baby for the wedding portion? If not doable don't go.", "$1000 for 4 nights though? That's a discount", "And OP seemed to even understand about the ceremony. People can take turns holding baby outside the venue.", "The sister told her not to come, so she seems OK with OP not being there, though. She really does not want the baby to steal her spotlight for the entire weekend. I don't blame OP for not wanting to go.", "At our venue there was no set up for mics or anything, so a baby screaming would have meant people not being able to hear the celebrant/readings/vows. Which I know is not fascinating to other people, but I'd argue is an important part of a wedding.", "Them give that room to the niece *and her parents*.", "That would be a great idea, and I\u2019m mystified as to why it\u2019s not happening!  Are niece\u2019s parents using this as a child-free vacation?  Trying for another baby?  Does the neice snore like a freight train?  So many questions."]}
