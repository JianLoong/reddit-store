She has an IEP and enrolled in the special education program at our local high school. This last term she came down with mono and then Covid and missed a lot of school.  We were coming to the end of the term and her English teacher wouldn\u2019t work with us on waiving some of the assignments she missed because of her illnesses. One of the assignments she was missing was a short story about a dystopian society. Because of her dyslexia, she has a hard time putting her thoughts in her head onto paper. We have helped her many times by having her verbally talk out the assignment and then help her write the sentences. The ideas and plot were hers, but the actual text was a combination of mine and hers. So obviously it had good grammar and punctuation compared to her normal writing style. The end of the term was right before Christmas break and she turned in the short story the day the term ended. I emailed her English teacher explaining how she struggles putting words on paper and I helped her with the story but the idea and plot was hers. She was pretty happy with the story and it made me happy to help her realize that she can write a good story. That afternoon, we got an email from her teacher saying that he ran the story through an AI detection software and it was flagged as written by AI and my daughter had cheated and was getting a zero. He also claimed he discussed it with other teachers and the school administration and they all agreed it was cheating. I was so pissed off. I immediately emailed him back reminding him of the email I sent earlier and it wasn\u2019t written by AI. But the teacher had left for Christmas break and didn\u2019t respond. I spent the days of Christmas break stewing about this. I started testing the AI detection software they use and it was easily tricked. I would write paragraphs of text or copy letters to the editor into the AI detector and it would flag them as written by AI. I then asked ChatGPT to explain how AI detectors work and ran it through the AI detector and it came back as written by human. Clearly this AI detector that claims 99% accuracy is full of crap. I even contacted a lawyer to see what I could do if the school wouldn\u2019t back down. The day before school restarted, I noticed the teacher changed the grade from a 0 to a more accurate grade. He didn\u2019t contact me to apologize for calling her a cheater. So when school restarted, I told my daughter to not attend his class. \n\nAITA for not letting her attend the English class with this teacher? He is the only 10th grade English teacher for Special Ed English and the school said there aren\u2019t any options to change her class schedule. I refuse to accept this explanation and I want them to fix it.", "created_utc": 1704695629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191ep7o/aita_for_being_angry_at_a_teacher_that_falsely/", "score": 709, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you make her do that, you will become the asshole to your daughter.", "So you wrote a highschool paper for your kid and then got mad when you got called out as a cheater.

Imagine at your job, whatever it is - makes you use a certain tool and if the tool comes up with a positive result it's a full stop per your direct orders. Not following that results in insorbindation, but to be doubly sure, you checked with your supervisor and they said \"yup its a full stop\". How are you going to handle that situation? Most likely exactly the same as the teacher\n\n\\#2 - She did cheat - you wrote the paper, you admitted it to the teacher, and here. It was different \"better\" than what she can currently do. That's cheating regardless of what justification you use. Someone AKA not her - wrote her paper. It may have been her ideas and thoughts - but you put it into action. Your child is a high school student, you can't write for them forever, the entire part of school and IEP is to identify problems and take steps to correct them. If you are doing their homework for them, then well they can't identify the problems and create a program to help them overcome them. \n\nI understand the anger but please take a step back.

WhoTF are you, Felicity Huffman?  Your kid cheated, with your help, and now you want to involve a lawyer?\n\nThird, demands?  You demand this, you demand that because you don't believe it's fair.  You're what's called a lawnmower parent--you mow down any problem in your child's path and then wonder why your kid is so immature.  All you do is blame the school for any little problem your kid has.  Most of us realize what the problem is--parents like yourself.\n\nLastly, here's an option:  quit taking such a high and mighty brinksmanship attitude.  Not attend the class until the problem is fixed?  JFC, give me a break lady.  Look at the lesson you just taught your kid:  be a quitter.

The method used to detect the cheating was flawed, but you basically admitted it. \n\nYou weren't acting as text to speech. You were correcting her at every step of the way to the point you basically wrote it yourself, just with her ideas.\n\nI had a friend who always got multiple table math problems incorrect in 5th grade, so the teacher would assign him to write it out multiple times as homework. His mom would do almost all of it for him to \"help speed it up\". That's not helping, that's just getting through the assignment quicker and missing the entire point of the assignment. Your method was less egregious and more interactive, but you did most of her work for her.", "> The ideas and plot were hers, but the actual text was a combination of mine and hers.\n\nRegardless, you aided your daughter in some level of cheating.  I am a former middle school teacher, and (for good teachers) the actual point of a writing assignment is not to turn in something perfect, but something that accurately demonstrates your child's understanding of a subject, and their ability to articulate those thoughts in an understandable way.  It shows their level, and by writing this with you editing or correcting grammar for her, she is not going to learn how to do this on her own. \n\nWith an IEP her disability should already be considered in her assessments.  And by doing these things for her, you also do a disservice to your daughters teacher by having them misunderstand her level as well.  You should have had your daughter write her essay, and then assisted in proofreading what might need correction.  This is how she learns. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That afternoon, we got an email from her teacher saying that he ran the story through an AI detection software and it was flagged as written by AI and my daughter had cheated and was getting a zero.\n\nThe teacher DOES have some suckage here because AI detectors are notoriously not accurate, and there are other ways to determine if AI is being used.  It is a tool, not a test.  As a teacher AI is a huge problem in cheating, and the teacher is right to consider this as possibly generated if they graded prior to your email, as it would be so different from your child's usual ability. \n\nHowever for this teachers defense, you already admitted to some degree of cheating by having this essay be a \"mix\" of your daughters words and yours.  As far as the teacher is concerned, you wrote 1/2 of this paper. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He is the only 10th grade English teacher for Special Ed English and the school said there aren\u2019t any options to change her class schedule. I refuse to accept this explanation and I want them to fix it.\n\nThis is the only SpEd English teacher in the school.  Unless you want your daughter to attend non-SpEd courses for this grade, then this particular teacher is your only option.  The school cannot make a teacher, particularly a SpEd teacher, appear out of thin air.  The way I see it, your options are this teacher, a non-SpEd teacher, or you transfer your daughter to a new school.  \n\nYou clearly care very much about your daughter, and no one can fault you for that.  Please remember that the grade on the paper at the end of the day i not what is important about your daughters needs.  She needs to have the practice of writing and making her own mistakes so she can learn from them.  She is only in the 10th grade, and this is not going to make or break her future education unless you continue to not allow her to learn for herself.  You are also showing your daughter that she can't do this for herself and that you are going to fix her problems. \n\nThe best thing you can do for your daughter is to let her make mistakes, show her where those mistakes are, and allow *her* to correct them. \n\n**YTA** but you do very clearly care.

A kid being unable to put down their own words on paper in 10th grade is a situation that absolutely calls for increased communication between teacher and parents- because if a general ed student submitted that kind of assignment, it would \\*absolutely\\* still be cheating even if it wasn't written by ChatGPT.  \n\nKids using the internet to cheat isn't new.

Most important with not attending the class cos he didn\u2019t apologise to you (wtf?). But more often in basically controlling her and telling her what to do. As sometimes in wanting to help people who struggle we overstep and manage everything for them. And it robs them of the chance to do it and fail and learn themselves. I say that from experience. It takes away responsibility from them.\n\nIt comes from a place of love, but what you\u2019ve described is a bit overbearing. \n\nTelling her not to attend his class is going to cause **her** problems.

For starters, '99% accurate' isn't even a meaningful number with things like this. If you're curious about how 'AI detectors' work, it's just another AI basically. This is a kind of problem called a 'classification' problem. Take in some kind of data, and then try and add the correct label. Of these images, which is of cats, and which is of dogs?\n\nIn classification problems, you actually need two numbers to measure how well the model works. The traditional numbers used are called the 'sensitivity' and the 'specificity', though there are other metrics that can be used instead (the ROC AUC curve in particular is common). In plain English though, sensitivity has to do with how many true positives are correctly identified. If you have 1,000 submitted essays with 400 written by AI, if 398 of the AI written ones were identified as being written by AI, that would be a pretty good sensitivity. That'd be a low number of false negatives. But if the AI thinks 600 of those thousand were written by AI, that'd be a LOT of false positives, which... obviously you and your daughters were false positives (not written by an AI but flagged as such).\n\nOne of the main reasons two numbers are used instead of one, is because the problem lends itself well to tuning based on whether false positives or false negatives are ultimately more costly. If you can't build a perfect classifier, usually you can at least tune things so you get more of one than the other. For disease diagnosis, maybe an early cheap test with a lot of false positives but very few false negatives would be fine. Maybe you can get a second more expensive followup test to weed out the false positives, but a false negative might mean an extra year of the cancer developing unchecked (for example).\n\nMeanwhile for youtube kids, you might not care about false positives at all (videos that most people would say is appropriate for kids gets flagged and removed... not that big of a deal) but a false negative? You REALLY don't want to let anything terrible slip through the filter.\n\nIn production, using a classification system isn't trivial. You need to know the likelihoods of false positives and false negatives, and have an appropriate way to handle a judgement that you know isn't entirely trustworthy.\n\nAnyway. All of the above is just a little technical background for how to even think about this kind of a problem. The next step is knowing a bit about independent testing for accuracy on these models. [this](https://journals.sfu.ca/jalt/index.php/jalt/article/view/861) small survey for example showed extremely poor performance for the 5 detectors tested. Even the best performing model (copy leaks) got 6 wrong out of 21 when fed 100% AI generated essays. Much more interesting to me personally, this is a related problem to detecting deep fake video and other AI generated content, and I know in that space it's basically an arm's race. There's a number of ways to tweak things to get around detectors, but the most direct line is using what's called [adversarial attacks](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.644/). In this paper, the authors explored building an automated system to make simple word choice and sentence structure changes to make AI generated essays get flagged as human written. They had easy success with it of course, because this problem is fundamentally unsolvable I believe. Even if there's enough signal there to identify AI generated essays currently, I find it extremely hard to believe it'll be that way for long. I don't even think video will be impossible to make fundamentally undetectable, and that's a vastly more challenging problem. That one at least might have a decade before fundamentally perfect forgery is possible, I think with language generation it might already be close to here even now, at least for students able to dig up the real state of the art approaches.\n\nAnyway. My own two cents. Schools are shitting bricks, and looking for hope on how to fight this new form of cheating. Frankly, they're fucked and I think they know it... this will ultimately require completely new ways of approaching education as a whole, and might mean the end of essay based homework, or... I honestly don't know. It's a crazy abyss to be on the brink of, and I can understand why they'd desperately want a perfect Oracle to help keep the status quo the way it is. Unfortunately for them, no such Oracle exists, or likely can exist even. And what imperfect Oracles there are will become increasingly poor over time, likely in months and years. Extremely short time scales. I can see how loathe teachers are to distrust their rickety safety system here, but that's a real shitty reason to throw your daughter under the bus. I suppose it's no different than a lot of imperfect or biased AI that's being used. Everything from Loan applications to HR decisions really shouldn't be made without human oversight, we shouldn't be trusting models fully with stuff like this. But people are scared, and don't have better tools, so... it is what it is right now. Frankly, parents getting real pissed off and hassling the school is probably the only thing that'll change this over reliance on AI essay detectors, so not only are you NTA, but you're actively helping all the other kids in the entire district by adding your small bit to the scale. Getting pissed and making noise is borderline your civic duty, but I do feel for them. It's not like there's an easy alternative, once they admit the detectors can't be fully trusted (or even trusted very much at all by the looks of things). An apology would be nice, but at least your daughter got her grade fixed. Good luck navigating, this is a shitty time to be going through the education system. And for what it's worth too, good luck the next time (and the next) that this happens.", "I was clearly on your side until you told your daughter to skip class.  YTA.  There was an issue - it was resolved.  If you wanted an apology to your daughter (and she clearly deserves one) then you should have reached out to the school administration or your daughter's IEP counselor.  You are NOT doing your daughter any favors.  You should be demonstrating to her how to resolve issues, not how to have tantrums.  Skipping class is going to hurt your daughter.", "Wow I have a lot to say here. \n\nYTA, though I think you have good intentions. I do agree that the teacher made a BIG mistake when alleging that AI was involved. And of COURSE it makes sense to want to help your kid out with school. But unless there is a specific accommodation for providing editing for your child (and as someone who worked in special education, I cannot imagine this accommodation exists), you need to mostly let her do her own work for school. Some help is fine - but direct editing is not. The final product might not be perfect, but that\u2019s okay! IEPs exist to provide the necessary supports only - and nothing more - so that the student can work towards academic independence to the extent that their disability allows. \n\nA lawsuit is not the answer here. Neither is telling your daughter not to attend class - that is the OPPOSITE of what she needs, and withholding your child from education is illegal. However, as a parent, you have certain rights when it comes to your daughter\u2019s IEP. This includes requesting a re-evaluation of your daughter\u2019s IEP if you think her current program is not sufficient. By law, the school has to comply with your wish for a re-evaluation in a timely fashion. During the re-evaluation, you can ask about some other accommodations (e.g. a scribe) and see if she might qualify. \n\nAnd finally - did you tell the school that you were considering legal action? If that\u2019s the case, the school will default to communicating with you as little as possible to protect themselves from liability. In that scenario, it\u2019s possible the teacher wanted to reach out and apologize, but was told not to for legal reasons. Yes, that would be messed up, but that might be what\u2019s happening behind the scenes. At this point, I would request a meeting with the teacher directly and use the opportunity to a) express your and your child\u2019s feelings around the teachers AI accusation, and b) discuss how best to support your child in the classroom and at home (NOT to argue, but simply to share perspectives).

Makes me think they did a bit more.", "A solid point - but I think the context isn't just accused here. A false accusation has to be false - in this case is more like - you harassed a coworker (wrote the paper for the child) and they accused you of a different harassment (AI cheater). The frustration should be on your own behavior -", "**It wasn\u2019t an unfair decision.**  The daughter submitted work that she didn\u2019t do herself.  That is literally the definition of plagiarism.\n\nShe reached out to a lawyer to see how she could sue this teacher for Christ\u2019s sake.   She was totally just frustrated about the situation, you\u2019re right.  \n\nThe entitlement among you parents is honestly stomach turning.", "Objectively, no. \n\nPlagiarism means taking someone else's work and passing it off as your own without crediting the other person. They credited the mom in the email so it cant be plagiarism even if the work was the moms which it wasn't.\n\nAll mom did was write what the student said and suggest corrections, thats not cheating.\n\nPick up a dictionary for fucks sake.", "The thing is, no one knows how AI \"detection\" by AI works, including the people who create and maintain the AI. The training is so deep down the rabbit hole that there are no flags, no singular line or style it can highlight; it's a black box. The \"detection\" systems provide proof of concept by feeding known-source papers in and comparing the results to documented reality and calling it good enough. The only actual way to detect AI is to find errors that most humans wouldn't make or to verify that citations are actually real. (And there is significant overlap between the lower end of human capability and the upper end of technical capability, so even then it's not absolute.)", "No, I never claimed that to be a conclusion.\n\nedit. theoretical philosophical view point -> which was more of a general comment on the situation now and in the future.", "But now you are only picking a very specific scenario which is not really feasible and not at all realistic usage of LLM's because if you only use this prompt your story will turn out below average, but yes, it would still be your short story, just not a good one.", "Sure. \n\nBut first it is good to realize that LLM's will be very prevalent, right? You don't write \"written with Word, on a Windows computer\" on every piece of paper you write. It is just not feasible. So the same applies with LLM's. It might be now that you need to cite it but in the future not so because you would be writing it on every paper or then just lying about it(ok not maybe every paper).\n\nThen it is also important to realize that you are not control of who you are right? There are some automatic factors to you as a person like breathing, blinking your eyes..etc.. so from that perspective it is also feasible to say you can form a connection with something outside your own body because you aren't not only your body right? It is possible to be in tune with the workings of an LLM or in other words adapt for it to be part of your own thought processes so instead of thinking about something, typing it down, seeing what the LLM responds with you will be much faster to use it than someone else that does not use it. The output you make will be more unique than just someone randomly asking it to write \"a short story\". It is your own creative work. You are at the steering wheel so this LLM is a system 3 to complement system 1 and system 2.\n\nAnd then it's also good to understand that this is a fundamental shift. So applying the same metrics will not do. Plagiarizing is taking something a sentient entity has written and copying that word for word. LLM's can come close to that, but only if specifically prompted and it is quite rare for people to do so using LLM's.\n\nIn other words, when people use a lot of LLM's the output is the extension of what that persons creative mind can create and not just a copy of something, it is a unique imprint.\n\nFor your question I can't really answer it anymore since it comes quite naturally nowadays and I can't always tell which parts I have written or which parts the AI has written. It really depends on the scenario. For more creative writing the LLM's suck, but it can give a nice structure. For a more technical documentation it is very good, then I mostly use it as is. But for every document \"I've written\" it is 100% me, but worded and structured a little better.\n\nAnecdotally I have never learned, read, or \"written\" as much as I have now. I've also never been a school person because I have some severe learning difficulties but now it's a total 180 and I plan on studying even further because it has made school so fun.\n\n\"The future is now old man\" has never been more accurate.", "I am not sure how to explain it in English but with a ghostwriter it is a sentient entity while with the LLM it is more a reflection of your own thoughts. So even though you are not the one writing the words you are still the progenitor of the \"music\" if that makes sense.\n\nWith a ghostwriter it would be akin to saying you want a song about Rock n' Roll from someone but with the LLM you are the Rock n' Roll. \n\nThe brain is just that malleable.", "so having someone edit or peer review grammar is cheating? is spellcheck cheating? is voice to text cheating? by your metric all of these should be considered cheating", "For your average 10th grader, yes, absolutely.\n\nHowever, for a Sp. Ed. student there can definitely be leeway on that- I have some students where I would happily accept \"text written by mom\" in lieu of the \"absolutely nothing\" I'd get otherwise- but it needs to be documented and discussed, ideally as part of the student's IEP. \n\nWhich is my primary complaint with OP, that they are neglecting their duty to communicate and jumping straight to talk of changing courses and lawyers.  It sounds like this whole sitch was instigated by one singular email, and that's not nearly enough to justify her response IMO.", "I would strongly disagree with that, and given that the parent admitted that to the teacher in writing and the teacher didn't comment on that being cheating lends strong evidence to it not being cheating.", "Clearly, the teacher and the school disagree with you.", ">Because parents like these aren't worth dealing with a lot of the time, and K-12 teachers are under extreme pressure from administrators to make parents happy.\n\nReal talk....If this is all true, then it's not cheating.\n\nAlso, I'd love to hear what you think teachers and schools mean when they say parents need to be more involved in their kids' education and academic success if it doesn't mean sitting down with them and actually helping them learn.\n\nFinally, I'd make the argument that for any homework assignment in k-12, it is far more important that the child actually learns the lesson the assignment was meant to teach than they adhere to a strict code of conduct of what constitutes cheating and non-cheating.", "And one of those supports is her mom, which is ok!", "She acted as both speech to text, and as a parent helping her daughter with her homework.", "Yeah, I am not sure how to see this situation :\n\nDid OP only guide their daughter to construct the phrases so she wouldnt mix words and letters, or did they write the essay for her ? Even her comments are not clear about that. \n\nHowever, if the teacher was not okay with that, they should have said so. Using the pretense (if it's what happended) of the AI written text accusation to grade a zero, because they didn't agree with this help but didn't want to say so (again, not sure that it's the case), is not acceptable.", "You are changing the goal post again.\n\nThe teacher didnt accuse the daughter of cheating because she was helped by a parent, they accused her of cheating **because they falsely thought that the essay was written by an AI**.\n\nThe teacher was informed that OP helped the daughter. If they had a problem with that, not only they would have told OP, but they wouldnt have needed to accuse the daughter of using an AI.", "Unless the assignment said \u201cWritten by Little Susie and Mom\u201d then it absolutely WAS passed off as her own work, making it plagiarism.  And unless the assignment was \u201ccollaborate with your mom to write this story\u201d that means little Susie cheated.\n\nAnd yes, having someone else correct your work for poor grammar is actually getting them to do your work for you.  If the student struggled with grammar, she should be working on her editing and proofreading skills, not letting mom do that shit for her.", "Exactly. Complex models may be more accurate, but their decisions become harder to explain. It's easier to interpret simpler models such as decision trees, but those are typically not as accurate. So there is a trade-off between accuracy and explainability.\n\nSource: am currently studying AI and data science.", "You think using a LLM is the same as using a word processing program? Bruh.\n\nI guess the real upshot of people lapping up AI is that it's really separating wheat from chaff in real time. To any creatives reading this: your creativity is a real, tanigble skill, and it is so valuable in fact that some people will use a computer to try (and fail) to come close.", "AI isn\u2019t a reflection of your own thoughts, though. It\u2019s a reflection of everyone else\u2019s thoughts that have been used to create its baseline of what constitutes its output for any given prompt. In neither instance are you doing the actual drafting.", "There is scribing and then there is changing it.  The OP wrote the corrections for her daughter.  If she was scribing, it should have the child\u2019s errors in it.  The teacher would also be able to recognize the child\u2019s writing.  However the OP transcribed it was enough for the teacher to suspect that it was the child\u2019s writing.  There is a difference between editing and changing it yourself.  Usually with students with writing disabilities there are accommodations such as outlines, chunking, etc.  those should have been done first instead of just writing an essay from scratch top to bottom.  Students also have a roster special ed teacher that helps with their accommodations. She states that this is a special education English teacher so he would be familiar with her child\u2019s IEP.", "Honestly - A teacher has a playbook to follow, just like you do at your work.  Regardless of what the amount was (cheating), which was better grammar (sentence structure) or punctuation - the fact is - in the context you wrote about harassment. There was harassment - how much is yet to be determined, but all parties know there was harassment. I have 0 tolerance policies at work for certain things, they just are a no-fly. Nothing we can do, if it's a false positive, take that up with the people who gave us the false positive (AI Tool) not the person using it. The teacher went to double-check - which is A+ in my book, and they got the same answer. Not sure what more you want the teacher to do, especially with an irate person. Teachers teach children, they are not here to teach or coach parents. If they gave other students 0 because of this tool to me that's the end of the discussion. Maybe you find it harsh, but its high school - not grade school.", "No he didn\u2019t.  I guarantee you that the teacher could tell exactly who wrote which portions of that paper just by looking at it.  He put it through the AI detector either because was obligated to do so by some school policy, or as a curiosity to confirm what he already knew. \n\nTeachers know what students are or aren\u2019t capable of.  When a student magically states producing grammatically correct work that is completely different from the work they\u2019ve produced all year so far, you don\u2019t need an AI detector to see what\u2019s going on.  Especially when their in-class assignments don\u2019t reflect this miraculous improvement in work quality.", "What part of dyslexia do you not understand? Yea shes gonna struggle with grammar, reading, writing and probably even speaking for her whole life. Thats common knowledge.\n\nAnd as someone who had an IEP there's probably special permissions in there for when her dyslexia is acting up, permissions like having an adult translate speech to paper.", "No that is not what I said.", "Yes, that is not what I mean.", "Her mother didn\u2019t translate speech to paper. Her mother made corrections and rewrote what the daughter came up with to fix the grammar and punctuation.  That\u2019s not how IEPs work.  I also had one in school, and I read about 75 of them every year."]}
