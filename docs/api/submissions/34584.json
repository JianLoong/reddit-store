She has an IEP and enrolled in the special education program at our local high school. This last term she came down with mono and then Covid and missed a lot of school.  We were coming to the end of the term and her English teacher wouldn\u2019t work with us on waiving some of the assignments she missed because of her illnesses. One of the assignments she was missing was a short story about a dystopian society. Because of her dyslexia, she has a hard time putting her thoughts in her head onto paper. We have helped her many times by having her verbally talk out the assignment and then help her write the sentences. The ideas and plot were hers, but the actual text was a combination of mine and hers. So obviously it had good grammar and punctuation compared to her normal writing style. The end of the term was right before Christmas break and she turned in the short story the day the term ended. I emailed her English teacher explaining how she struggles putting words on paper and I helped her with the story but the idea and plot was hers. She was pretty happy with the story and it made me happy to help her realize that she can write a good story. That afternoon, we got an email from her teacher saying that he ran the story through an AI detection software and it was flagged as written by AI and my daughter had cheated and was getting a zero. He also claimed he discussed it with other teachers and the school administration and they all agreed it was cheating. I was so pissed off. I immediately emailed him back reminding him of the email I sent earlier and it wasn\u2019t written by AI. But the teacher had left for Christmas break and didn\u2019t respond. I spent the days of Christmas break stewing about this. I started testing the AI detection software they use and it was easily tricked. I would write paragraphs of text or copy letters to the editor into the AI detector and it would flag them as written by AI. I then asked ChatGPT to explain how AI detectors work and ran it through the AI detector and it came back as written by human. Clearly this AI detector that claims 99% accuracy is full of crap. I even contacted a lawyer to see what I could do if the school wouldn\u2019t back down. The day before school restarted, I noticed the teacher changed the grade from a 0 to a more accurate grade. He didn\u2019t contact me to apologize for calling her a cheater. So when school restarted, I told my daughter to not attend his class. \n\nAITA for not letting her attend the English class with this teacher? He is the only 10th grade English teacher for Special Ed English and the school said there aren\u2019t any options to change her class schedule. I refuse to accept this explanation and I want them to fix it.", "created_utc": 1704695629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191ep7o/aita_for_being_angry_at_a_teacher_that_falsely/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She missed a significant portion of the last term and needed to turn in work to be evaluated to see where she was and what she needed to work on upon her return. If we take the AI accusations out of this and read solely into the cheating, yeah, you guys did. What's the benefit of your child's IEP if you're just going to do the work she can't? Are you going to go to work with her too? Have you seen the US literacy rates? Half of Americans have a 6th grade or below reading level.

The teacher mouthed off, but thought better of it over Christmas break.  You are; however, in a difficult place because your daughter needs the English credits to graduate.  I suggest having a meeting to amend your daughter\u2019s IEP so that she may complete written assignments by verbally telling you what to write. Also add that unless or until the School Board adopts a policy on the use of AI detection software and identifies which software programs are approved for use,  the teacher shall not any such software to evaluate your daughter\u2019s homework.  I do not know your school\u2019s policy about online learning.  That might be an option for the English class.", "NTA. However, what you should have done was booked a meeting with her teacher, show him how badly the AI detector worked, and said, \"I hope you don't make this assumption again.\" By telling your daughter not to attend his class, you are preventing her from being able to easily access English in general. What do you think will happen to her grade if she has to struggle through in a class that doesn't support her needs. If you make her do that, you will become the asshole to your daughter.", "So you wrote a highschool paper for your kid and then got mad when you got called out as a cheater. You pressed the teacher until he caved and gave you the grade you wanted for your child (most likely because it wasn't worth the fight). However, that still wasn't good enough.

I applaude you for helping your child and pity that teacher who should have known better especially after you explained the situation.\n\nBut I do concede it kind of defeats the purpose of English class if you help the child with grammar and punctuation that much.

Why did the teacher even think to run the essay through an AI detector?", "You're getting mad at a parent for actually properly parenting their child for once.

But if the teacher were to give the daughter a low-grade because of writing mistakes made as a result of her dyslexia, then  that would be a massive issue because it is punishing her for something she can\u2019t help.\n\nThat would be like punishing a person in a wheelchair for being unable to jump rope.\n\nA compromise has to be made somewhere.", "She\u2019s dyslexic.

The scribe writes down their words exactly, including punctuation and rereads it to them if needed before final corrections are dictated by the student.\n\nEven for students whose grammar is affected by another disability (very rare), the solution is for the teacher to ignore the mistakes. NOT for someone to do it properly for them.", "I got that, yeah. I agree it\u2019s hard to say anything without knowing what\u2019s in the IEP.

I\u2019m just trying to provide a possible explanation to justify why the parent may need to do this for the daughter.", "It would be highly unlikely that the IEP would involve anything that is produced by someone else.  The grades are always assigned to students, and students alone. Summative assessment can be used for litigious reasons, and should not be anyone else's work, but the student themselves.", "It's probably because she hasn't been trained as a scribe, doesnt fully understand how the criteria or marking guide works and just wants the best for her child. Quite understandable, and I'm not bagging OP at all.\n\nStill makes it a problem however, as it is no longer the daughters work.", "Makes sense, I can only speak from my own experience.", "That\u2019s fair. If that\u2019s the case and the school sees this as an issue, then OP should get in contact with the special education program to learn how to properly scribe for the daughter while maintaining more of her educational integrity."]}
