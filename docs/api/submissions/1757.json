You delivered a well-earned clapback.  Cutting but not rude.

I don't see why she didn't believe you.", "NTA. She was being racist.", "You think someone from Australia would know that Aboriginal people can have blonde hair if they're black.  I think that's fact it's really cool. I'm black myself and sometimes wish I had blonde hair.

She must be extra dumb if she\u2019s from there and doesn\u2019t even know about Aboriginal peoples. I\u2019m Asian and our specific ethnicity used to have people with blonde hair. My niece is also Asian and albino with very light skin and blonde hair. There\u2019s no reason for someone to comment on hair color except for the fact that they are dumb and racist.", "NTA. This lady should not have contradicted you. Especially to your face. When you spout ignorance to the world sometimes the world answers back.

She was being ignorant and racist, I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that. I\u2019ve been asked before why I have black people hair but I\u2019m white.

I love how you've written your story, it somehow comes across as the most Australian thing I've ever read lol", "NTA\n\nYou didn't cause the shit. Instead, you gave a rude and ignorant woman a taste of her own medicine. That woman then went ahead and proved she's racist. I hope that woman does not return to that shop again, so your mum can shop in peace.", "NTA mate, she was more than capable of keeping her mouth shut and not talking shit", "ahh I don't blame her, she grew up in a very different Australia then me.", "Unfortunately its an attitude a lot of Aussies still have.", "Nope, my nephew is Romanian (quite possibly Transylvanian), blond as hell.", "Yeah its really fucking weird she didn't know that, it pretty common in the area I live for us to have blonde hair. Hell one of my cousin has what looks like ginger hair in a certain light.", "Im pretty dark skin with blonde hair and my half brother (still aboriginal) looks white but has really dark hair. Genetics are just weird.", "Hopefully her kid sees through the bullshit, she seemed like a sweet girl so we can only hope.", "My intent isn't to lay any blame on your mother, but rather show that your willingness to stand up for yourself is a positive and definitely not asshole behavior.", "just remember, the reason you have grown up in a different type of world is because of the efforts of people to stand up for themselves just like you did there !", "Romania is in Europe, where white people hail from.", "Are...are Romanians not Caucasian?", "Fingers crossed mate and from personal experiences who has a mother exactly like, I can't stand her for many reasons and her racism is one of them.", "Oh absolutely just still a long way to go and I'm sure its going to be still a long way to go by the time I'm gone. Fellas like me still have grandparents who were apart of the stolen generation so that kind of generational trauma can take a while to fix along with the attitudes of other people who aren't indigenous.", "I don't know if I'm just ignorant but I thought they were. Unless this is just some old world shit where europeans don't count eastern europeans as white.", "Yes they are. Technically, there\u2019s no \u2018white\u2019 race it\u2019s Caucasian, \u2018white\u2019 is more USA thing.\n\nI\u2019m from Eastern Europe and never have I heard someone referring to Romanians, or Italians, or any other nationality in Europe as non-white.\n\nPlus, except for more Northern European nations, we all tan. I can tell you that my skin is very pale naturally, and I\u2019m blonde/blue eyes, but I can tan (and not burn) to a lot darker tone. Heck, tan lines will stay visible for months after.\n\nOP, thanks for sharing your story! You were totally NTA. And I have to google now blonde aboriginal hair because it sounds cool \ud83d\ude0e", "Hey off topic bro but can aboriginal dudes get away with using N word the same way black dudes in the usa do? Ive always been curious", "i\u2019m not black or australian so i can only imagine from my own experiences as a queer person dealing with bigots what it\u2019s like for you, and my heart goes out to you. you are strong and brave for what you said! i also get why your mom is frustrated, but it should be at the situation and not directed at you. but fr i think this could have been an important moment for that little girl, hopefully she will at least learn from this that her  racist mom doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about when it comes to black people", "Maybe they're considered part of the \"spicy\" white crew?  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnyway don't feel bad about your reaction to the racist lady. It's funny because black people in America deal with the same thing. And my parent's generation still gets anxious about being loudly anti-racist. Your mom will be ok, I can say from experience that it just takes some time to unlearn being \"respectful\" all the time.", "Yeah we can but I personally don't like using it even if I can say it and being apart of the Clontarf foundation we were taught not to say it by our instructors. It just doesn't have the same history here that it does in America.", "Theres definitely hope for the little girl, she did call her mum rude so I guess someones teaching her something right but its certainly not the mum.", "Ahhh like Italians and the Spaniards. So the ones who know how to cook.", "You made me giggle with \u201cspicy\u201d white crew \ud83e\udd23\n\nAnd no, in Europe it\u2019s just Caucasian. \nWhenever I try to apply USA \u2018white\u2019 \u2018non-white\u2019 to Europe it just doesn\u2019t work. I mean it doesn\u2019t really make sense anyways but here we are.", "Appreciate man i wasnt trying to be insensitive or anything just rarely get the chance to ask these questions ya know", "yeah nah no problem mate. Its interesting to learn how other places and cultures operate and see things.", "Also not all black people are like physically black too right?? I saw some aboriginal comedy things on yt and alot of the folks were pretty light skinned", "I've always thought black culture in the usa seems interesting because of movies but i guess idk what blackness really means in places like Australia ya know", "Im not light skin but a lot of blackfellas here are lightskin but this is because of the stolen generation where they stole Indigenous kids to assimilate them into white society with the purpose of them marrying white people to eventually breed us out. Because of this we try not to differentiate between dark, light or even white skin aboriginals. We are all one people belonging to this land, as long as you are accepted by the community as aboriginal you are aboriginal.", "Its very different from what I know. Even though our culture was being wiped out we still retain it and hold onto it for dear life while African Americans couldn't retain their culture because of the slave trade."]}
