I can tell you that my skin is very pale naturally, and I\u2019m blonde/blue eyes, but I can tan (and not burn) to a lot darker tone. Heck, tan lines will stay visible for months after.\n\nOP, thanks for sharing your story! You were totally NTA.

Ive always been curious", "i\u2019m not black or australian so i can only imagine from my own experiences as a queer person dealing with bigots what it\u2019s like for you, and my heart goes out to you. you are strong and brave for what you said! i also get why your mom is frustrated, but it should be at the situation and not directed at you. but fr i think this could have been an important moment for that little girl, hopefully she will at least learn from this that her  racist mom doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about when it comes to black people", "Maybe they're considered part of the \"spicy\" white crew?  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnyway don't feel bad about your reaction to the racist lady. It's funny because black people in America deal with the same thing. And my parent's generation still gets anxious about being loudly anti-racist. Your mom will be ok, I can say from experience that it just takes some time to unlearn being \"respectful\" all the time.", "Yeah we can but I personally don't like using it even if I can say it and being apart of the Clontarf foundation we were taught not to say it by our instructors. It just doesn't have the same history here that it does in America.", "Theres definitely hope for the little girl, she did call her mum rude so I guess someones teaching her something right but its certainly not the mum.", "Ahhh like Italians and the Spaniards. So the ones who know how to cook.", "You made me giggle with \u201cspicy\u201d white crew \ud83e\udd23\n\nAnd no, in Europe it\u2019s just Caucasian. \nWhenever I try to apply USA \u2018white\u2019 \u2018non-white\u2019 to Europe it just doesn\u2019t work.

Its interesting to learn how other places and cultures operate and see things.", "Also not all black people are like physically black too right?? I saw some aboriginal comedy things on yt and alot of the folks were pretty light skinned", "I've always thought black culture in the usa seems interesting because of movies but i guess idk what blackness really means in places like Australia ya know", "Im not light skin but a lot of blackfellas here are lightskin but this is because of the stolen generation where they stole Indigenous kids to assimilate them into white society with the purpose of them marrying white people to eventually breed us out. Because of this we try not to differentiate between dark, light or even white skin aboriginals. We are all one people belonging to this land, as long as you are accepted by the community as aboriginal you are aboriginal.", "Its very different from what I know. Even though our culture was being wiped out we still retain it and hold onto it for dear life while African Americans couldn't retain their culture because of the slave trade.", "NTA. I\u2019m Australian but not Indigenous. But for those non-Australians, I want to highlight that the slur the woman called OP is pretty damn bad. \n\nOP, even if the woman hadn\u2019t accused you of being a liar (when you weren\u2019t), they showed their true racist colours. People are ignorant assholes cos they don\u2019t have the information to know better. That little girl at least got taught something new today, and will hopefully remember it in the future. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA.

And people insist Australia isn't racist.\n\n Sigh\n\nAnd we both just know she doesn't think the word she used is a slur\n\nMassive NTA.", "NTA Completely fair. I also am aware of the plight of being a white looking aboriginal, (I'm a few generations removed) especially for southern aboriginal language groups where the melanin production is just simply less across the board.", "NTA.\n\nThat woman put you in the position of having to deal with her racist stupidity.\n\nYou didn't cause it. You just reacted to it.", "Surely she knows about the stolen generation, the mix of DNA from Europeans certainly made it possible for future generations. NTA, she was racist", "NTA, feel sorry for people that don't get we're all different. DNA comes in all shapes, sizes, and color.", "NTA.", "NTA what a bloody dumb weirdo that woman is. Half the indigenous people I know have light hair, and it is indeed pretty. You absolutely did the right thing, we can't allow ignorance to go unchecked. Really though, does this woman not know what indigenous people look like...? Fucking yikes.", "A classic case of \u2018don\u2019t start none, won\u2019t be none\u2019 some people just can\u2019t help themselves.", "Good on you for standing up for yourself!  Her only correct response would have been \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d  As a white person, a vocal minority are fubar\u2019d when presented with something outside their racial expectations.  NTA!", "NTA as an Aussie have seen plenty of Aboriginal people with blonde hair, it's not that uncommon. \n\nI'm sorry that you once again have to deal with small minded people. One of the most frustrating things in Australia is how many people think we don't have racism.  They're everywhere and so many times it's the casual racism that is so ingrained in the culture that people don't even hear/see it. \n\nKeep calling people out, hopefully that child remembers her mother being a hateful person and wants to be different and do better. We can all hopefully change the culture one moment at a time.", "Good for you Sis.", "NTA fellow aboriginal with light skin, it\u2019s important people learn these lessons about our culture and the misconceptions from colonisation aren\u2019t still spread to make out as fact. that woman knows a lot better than to call you that slur, hence how she scuttered away so quickly. you\u2019re good for teaching the little girl and hopefully the apple DOES fall far from the tree in that case\nedit to add: completely get your mums side though, it has been a much scarier place for our elders but i don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need to worry - i doubt she\u2019ll be looking to speak to you again any time soon haha", "NTA.  She was obviously a racist jerk.  I find it amazing how ignorant people can be.  I had a black friend in school who was a ginger with freckles.  People told her all the time that she must dye her hair.  I just watched a documentary on Cheddar Man who lived in the Mesolithic period in England.  They were able to extract his DNA and he had very dark skin and blue eyes.  Genetics just aren't as straight forward as most people think.  Good on you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA. My daughter is moving to Melbourne next month. She's part native American, and LGBTQ+ to boot. Is she going to face the same shit there too?", "NTA see her in the NT", "NTA    You were quite right to clap back.", "Fellow Aussie here.

It looked like she was about to call me the cheese word.", "I hate people saying Australia isn't racist. We only stopped the stolen generation in the 70s and that doesn't account for systematic racism and the general attitude of a lot of Australians toward first peoples. I cant count how many times Ive been called petrol sniffer and thats just the one insult.", "Im not white, Im actually pretty dark but I've seen the shit my half brother (whos white looking) goes through especially with the thing people will say in front of him when they think his just a tan looking white guy.", "i\u2019m a little surprised it wasn\u2019t the cheese word knowing the type of folks that get around, you guys will be alright i think she\u2019ll leave you alone from now on \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc", "We are so so horribly racist. I've had to stop reading the comment sections on FB for my own mental health. I get so angry. I was raised by racist boomer parents. No one has an excise for \"the way we were raised ' I remember at an early age thinking what my parents were saying didn't sound right. So awful. I just try my best to be a supporter every chance I get", "Yeah, holy shit are facebook news sites like 7, 9 and 10 are a cease pool of boomers being racist as fuck especially when it comes to indigenous people.

They're an ethnic minority in Romania and originated from Punjab and surrounding areas in South Asia. They can be blond.", "Yeah they cop the go back to where you came from crap too.\n\nBoomers.

Is she going to have issues there too?  :(", "Did you see the uproar when Luai from Penrith Panthers used in it on insta?  Did not go down well at all.", "Yes but Luai isn't indigenous, he's Maori and Samoan", "True, was more thinking he's not white. I - who am ridiculously white - was perplexed as to why everyone got mad for him using it \nAlso outed some racists in my friend group that had been keeping it under wraps so that was a whole thing"]}
