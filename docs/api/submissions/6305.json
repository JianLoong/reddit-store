I had a son Isaac who was Charlie's twin. He passed away from leukemia when he was 19. When he was diagnosed at 14, there was a lot of medical bills to pay for Isaac's treatment, and I ended up working a lot to pay for his hospital bills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring that time my ex-wife Brenda slept with Jake behind my back. I found out about the affair and we had a divorce when the twins were 15 and Amy 11.  All of them knew the full story of what happened and my ex and I had 50/50 custody. Charlie visited Brenda till she was 16 after which she stopped. We told Amy what happened when she was 14. But the thing is Jake is quite wealthy and Amy preferred it there more because she got spoiled. She eventually chose to stay with Brenda when she turned 16.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring this period I met Lucy I fell in love with her and got married when the twins were 19. Isaac passed away a few months after. Lucy herself h ad 2 daughters Claudia and Rose and they were both welcomed into the family. My son passed away a few months later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen Amy moved with her mom permanently she cut off all ties with us. She didn't leave peacefully too. She insulted everyone in the family and left. One of the things she yelled was \"I don't want to be a part of this sh!tty family\". She went NC with us too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn November, Jake and Brenda were charged with fraud, B&E, and apparently they were also in debt. They lost their homes and were thrown in jail. Since none of the other relatives were able to take her in, Amy came to us. I didn't want to take her in but Lucy convinced me to let her stay for a bit till she gets back on her feet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell ever since she left there have been a lot of changes to the house. And Amy has been complaining about them since she arrived. She complains about how she cant touch the snacks and how she has to pay for her own snacks and clothes(We feed her 3 meals a day + afternoon snacks). How she was given the smallest guest bedroom and how the other girls got big personalized bedrooms. How on Christmas the girls got amazing gifts and she only got a gift card. The last straw for her was NYs. We took the girls to a big party while she stayed at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we got back she started yelling at me how I'm a horrible father and how I replaced her with Claudia and Rose. I told her that she's the one who renounced the family and so she wasn't allowed in family things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut a lot of people are telling me that I'm essentially replacing her for something she did when she was a young, impulsive teen. So reddit AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I would like to add everyone including her has been in therapy before she left and after she came back. Nothing has come out of it.

NTA since she made it clear she wants nothing to do with you but still expects you to treat her like your daughter. It's kind of fucked of her.", "Sorry but I\u2019m not getting all these YTAs. The prodigal daughter isn\u2019t there because she wants to be, she\u2019s there because she has nowhere else to go. The 16 year old made a bad decision but the 21 year old is full of attitude. \n\nNTA", "If I'm reading this right... Amy wrote yall off at 16, and now 5 years later at 21yo has lost everything and is moving back because she has nowhere else to go? And you have been treating her as less than ever since?\n\nInfo: are yall charging her rent? Does she have a job? What is the long term goal? It sounds like she isn't quite a family member, but not quite a tenant either? She just exists in a home where she has to buy her own snacks?", "There seems to be a lot missing in the story", "NTA, she's had 5 years to get over the teenage impulsive decision.", "NTA. She made her decisions and these are the consequences. Has she ever apologised for what she did? If she wants things to improve that would be a start.", "This is a tough one. You are the parent, so you should be trying to help her through what is clearly a difficult time, not making it more difficult for her. On the other hand, it sounds like she would still be no contact with you if it wasn't for the fact that she has nowhere else to be. So it's not like she went out of her way to try to repair your relationship either. She's also 21, so if she's unhappy with the living arrangements, she can move out, and in my opinion has no room to complain about your stepchildren being spoiled at Christmas because they're still kids, and she's an adult. You should invite her on family outings though, especially if you have any desire to repair your relationship with her. I'm going to say you're NTA, but maybe view this as a clean slate, and try to get to know her again. If she continues pushing you away despite you taking her in, then you can go back to not inviting her to be a part of your family dynamics.", ">Since none of the other relatives were able to take her in, Amy came to us.\n\nI'm confused by why a grown adult at 21 is living with you after leaving your home. It's not like she went off to work and is struggling. She left to live with her mom, her mom got arrested, and now she's back with you?\n\nI'm all for family support - but this one reeks of Amy not having her shit together. I don't think YTA, but I do think there are some major issues behind the scenes. Amy has some unresolved issues stemming from the divorce and probably her time with her mom and step dad (especially now considering the crimes). \n\nShe needs to speak to someone about her problems, and it would probably be best if Amy finds her own place to live. Unless she's incapable of working - there's no reason she should be living in your home again.", "ESH. Amy was 10 when she found out her brother was dying.  You threw yourself into work, and her mother threw herself into the arms of another man.  The adults couldn't get it together, so you two  broke up the family instead of focusing on your children's trauma. Then, just as her brother is dying,  you make sure she knows that you left because her mom cheated.  I don't blame her for not wanting anything to do with you at that age.  You should've all been in therapy.  I'm guessing there's a lot more going on,  but Amy has had time to process her teenage feelings.  I'm not surprised she's failed to thrive as a young adult with such trauma and lousy parents, but it sounds like she has taken to the victim role and is causing trouble for your step daughters, who are blameless here, therefore she sucks.  You suck for not realizing what you did to your poor kids and not being grateful she's willing to have anything to do with you now.  Apologize for how things went down when she was a teen, and for punishing her since she's been back,  her response then is up to her.", "Hold up!\n\nSo Amy left permanently after you got *married* and after her brother *died*? (while she was 14 or 15?)\n\nDoes that maybe play a role in why she wanted out?\n\nand it sounds like you're leaving out a lot of info. Why did she insult the family while leaving? There has to be reason.\n\nShe couldn't have just decided to up and leave like that overnight while cussing you out. And why did she go NC? \n\nWhat's the story there?", "She needs guidance and direction. She seems like she's been spoiled where she was and never really grew out of being a teenager. Y'all need to have a family discussion on what her responsibilities are going to be. Yes, she hurt you as a teen, but teenagers are all jerks sometimes, there is science that proves their brain function goes down due to all the changes during puberty. \n\nYou need to allow yourself to feel hurt, but you also need to START HEALING that hurt and this is a GREAT OPPOTUNITY to REPAIR what was broken. \n\nShe NEEDS guidance on how to mature into an adult and maybe you should try family counseling to help you BOTH get things calmed down so you can start discussing things as adults. You both are hurting but she needs you to guide her or she will end up in a lot of messes, young girls without guidance don't make great choices.", "ESH. Yeah, she was an irrational teen and said horrible things. You're the adult who is still holding it against her and treating her like she's second class. If there is to be a functional relationship among you all, then someone needs to take the first step and you're the grown up. I recommend family therapy.", "NTA. Why she expected to just come back and be part of the family is nuts. She is only there because she would need to work to support herself elsewhere.", "NTA. She\u2019s an adult now and had time to repair her relationship with you but only came to you out of need and not out of want. however, I do think you resent your daughter and you\u2019re taking this opportunity to rub it in her face that she made the wrong choice. I hope there\u2019s a chance on the future for both of you to work thru the hurt thru therapy. Hopefully, she finds her own place soon so that you two can have the distance to work on healing.", "ESH;\n\nYou are punishing her for something she did as an \u2018impulsive teen\u2019 but from what you write she seems to be very spoilt.\n\nShe comes into your house after years and assuming you only have one guest room is pretty much demanding to kick others out of their rooms. She should realise that she is entering a house which isn\u2019t hers and that it is very much Lucy\u2019s daughter\u2019s home where they are expected to have an established presence.\n\nIf you were treating her the same as you were treating the rest of your kids then you would be in the clear though I can understand potentially not inviting her to a ny party where she wouldn\u2019t know anyone.", "You're Asian and she only pays for her extra snacks? Definitely NTA. She's there because she has nowhere else to go and her exclusion from family activities stems from her rude and entitled behavior, not because you don't want her there. \n\nWhy NTA especially when they're Asian? Most Asian cultures are collectivists and when you buy food, it's to share with everybody. That she's buying extra snacks only for herself and not to share with anyone/everyone in the household is downright rude.", "YTA.\n\nJeez, man, she was 16!  An angsty teen!  And you respond by inviting everyone to a party but her, when she's 21??  And sitting round the Christmas tree opening presents for everyone but her?\n\nLook, I know you're upset about what her mom did and what Amy did, and rightly so.  But take a look at what you're being like, here.", "YTA. You've completely failed to communicate and are in fact simply punishing her because of her behavior when she was young. You need to sit down, explain why you were hurt and figure out how you can be a family again, and if she refuses ___then___ you get to do as you're doing. But you're her father and have a responsibility to care for and about her.", "YTA. She was a teen. She still isn\u2019t old enough for her brain to be fully developed and she made a rash, likely hormonal, decision. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her decision wasn\u2019t encouraged by her mother. She is still your daughter. \n\nYou are treating her like the stray animal you had to let in the garage so it would freeze. She doesn\u2019t need to have the largest room, but to purposely treat her differently is wrong as you are the true adult. Not to mention you are showing your younger two children (stepchildren) that your love is very conditional and they will be spoiled as long as they never dare to cross you. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with taking slow steps to reconcile with your daughter. Nothing wrong with having hard conversation to address past decisions. But you aren\u2019t acting any more mature than she did but you are the actual adult in this situation", "Yup, YTA. If you\u2019re a parent, you\u2019ll always have to be the bigger person, not punishing your children for immaturity. Because guess what? Kids are immature and they will stay immature until 25 when they finally get some semblance of adult functioning. Until then, it\u2019s your responsibility to guide them, not be as immature as they are.", "NTA. She had 5 years to think about her actions. 5 years. She is a spoiled brat who frankly doesnt deserve what shes being given. 16 is old enough to realize the inplications of ones actions. Not only did she leave, she burned her bridges on the way out for no good reason other than to be hurtful. \nShe has a free roof over her head and food on her plate. She should shutup and be grateful you even took her in", "Jesus. Yes YTA, teenagers make bad decisions, but you were and are the adult in this situation. You have no idea what she was hearing from her mom at that time. It sounds like you\u2019re trying to take revenge on her now. You\u2019re making your daughter pay for food at your house? Got her just a gift card for Christmas? Made her stay home while everyone else went to a party?! I don\u2019t even treat strangers that way.", "NTA but it seems a lot of communication is needed.  \n\nAmy is 21 now, so an adult.  She made the choice to go NC.  At the very least she should admit she was a bad judge of character to choose them over you guys.  If she still thinks the other family is the \"good\" family and you guys are shitty, then she can leave and never come back and I wouldn't feel I owe her anything.\n\nIf, on the other hand, she shows some kind of regret for the past and has learned from all the experience and is prepared to be respectful towards you from now on, then that's different.  It all comes down to that conversation.", "YTA her sibling died at a time where there was also a lot of big family changes. She was a teenager (not good years for anyone) and didn\u2019t cope with all the changes so she lashed out.  Gosh, it is likely to have taken her 12-18 months before she adjusted to her brother\u2019s death let alone everything else.\n\nNow you\u2019re deliberately taking steps to make her feel alienated, and telling her she\u2019s not part of the family because of a grudge over what she said as a teen. \n\nThe unequal gifts and impersonal gift card is a bit of a kick in the teeth.\n\nThe guest bedroom is fine, it\u2019s what\u2019s available and I presume the other kids had the other rooms for years. But because she feels spited and unequal with other things that you\u2019re deliberately doing, it\u2019s a glaring issue for her.  She\u2019s feeling unloved and disconnected and the smallest difference is hugely obvious for her.\n\nWhat\u2019s your long term plan here?????   You\u2019ve got an opportunity to repair your relationship with her.  If you don\u2019t, be prepared for her to be NC long term as she moves deeper into adulthood.  She won\u2019t likely ever come back to you for help again after this treatment. If you want to be part of the adult she\u2019ll become, have a relationship with grandkids (if she wants kids) etc then stop the behaviour you\u2019re doing and genuinely connect with her.", "You're BTA in this situation. \n\nYou have to look at things from her perspective. She just had her own world flipped upside down, so she's probably got some shit going on in her head she isn't sharing with you. She sees her Bio-dad treating his stepdaughters in a way that she probably wasn't treated in her own home and is regretting choices she made when she was younger. \n\nNow on to her, she was welcomed into your home, and for her to expect to uproot one of your step-kids out of their rooms just so she could have a bigger room is asinine. She is also an adult. She should be buying food, her own clothes and helping around the house, even though she is your daughter. And even though she probably never had to do that at her mom's. I mean you could let her personalize her guest room a little so that she feels like she is actually a part of your household now even if it is only a temporary living situation. \n\nMight I suggest some family therapy for you and Amy initially and then maybe bring in the other girls and your wife", "NTA", "YTA and NTA at the same time.\n\nI mean, what you should have done from the very first day is to sit down with her and have a serious talk about the whole situation. But instead you went the YTA way and did all these things.\n\nSo, while I can still understand why you did what you did (NTA in this sense), you did it the wrong way (YTA). I think you still have to sit with your daughter and set everything straight instead of working to open the wound more and more.", "NTA Amy is a grown adult and you took her into your home even after she shit talked you. You arent replacing her, it seems like you just readjusted to a life without her. She went NC with you and now is expecting to be Daddy's little girl again. Thats not fair to your, your wife, or you kids", "YTA. 21 or not, renounced you or not, she still is your daughter, OP. You don't get to stop loving her as such just because she did, yes, as a young, impulsive teen. Life has a way of teaching lessons over time. You may have just validated her position. The fact that she is even there at all may be a sign she's wanting to reach out to you, right her wrong, not be treated like a prisoner on house arrest and shut out from family events.", "YTA did you get her therapy as a teen to get her through a crazy time in her life", "Yta. Cos she was an angsty 16 year old when she made those decisions. You as an adult should understand that (and forgive it, even is she doesn't ask because you are her Dad).\nRoom is fine, cos that is what it is, but maybe allow her to decorate it.\nThe gift situation is AH, she is your actual daughter, make her feel welcome and try to reestablish a relationship ship with her. Being treated like her step sisters helps.\n\nMore than this you should be sitting her down, tell her that her actions have heart you and before being fully welcome again, you need to build a trusting Relationship", "NTA she's shallow and the only reason she's with you is because they have been banged up, she's also an adult who can move out and get a job.", "INFO: since she came back, did you have a conversation with her about how she behaved 5 years ago?", "ESH because it sounds like none of you sat down together to discuss the emotional part of moving in, only the logistics.\n\nShe can\u2019t act like the last few years and her choices didn\u2019t happen.\n\nYou can\u2019t have your daughter living in your home and expect her to intrinsically understand she will be treated like a tenant.\n\nYou took her in, the act of a parent, but aren\u2019t treating her in any other way like your child. That\u2019s understandable but it\u2019s causing miscommunications.\n\nI know you mentioned therapy before she cut you off, but in my mind it\u2019s necessary now, even just to help convey your feelings and expectations moving forward.\n\nDoes she know that the second she moves into her dorms you don\u2019t want to see her ever again?", "ESH  Your daughter is obviously a spoiled brat.  She said some stuff when she was a teenager and it hurt your feelings.  You are mad at her.\n\nHowever, you are supposed to be the adult and you are acting like a child.  If you didn't want her in your home you should have refused to let her live there.  Allowing her in your home and then treating her like an unwanted stranger is beyond cruel.", "ESH\n\nYou don\u2019t ever replace your own kid.  That\u2019s so cruel.\n\nOn the other hand, her attitude is a massive problem.  It needs to be cleaned up if she expects to stay a day past her 18th birthday.", "YTA for punishing her for choosing her mother when she was 16. You're cruel and rubbing it in her face that she is not family. I bet you did the same when he was 16 and she dared choose her mother even after you informed her her mother was a cheater and should be shunned and that's why she went NC. She is still your daughter. Instead of acting like a father and an adult, you are horrible to her. You don't love her, you don't want to mend your relationship, you use her vulnerable situation to hurt her. Your own daughter. You are a horrible, vengeful person.", "Yta you wrote her off at *16*. She was a kid whose parents split and her brother died.  Yeah, she's an adult now but aging does not magically fix the trauma you caused.  And it doesn't seem like you even want to attempt to fix it.  So why the h*ll did you take her in?

I've been in a similar place in my life at a similar time. For me it was losing my grandfather, who was an anchor for me. I refer to him, looking back, as a second father. I could talk to him about anything at any time and he would be there to help guide me through it. But I lost him my freshmen year of high school, and I turned into an abusive, insulting, rage-filled little shit for 4 years. From just screaming and cussing my parents out to being arrest for domestic violence 4 times, I was like this. But my folks never gave up on me, like OP did his daughter at this point. They stood by my side, and eventually, I found enough solace in that fact that I set aside my anger, and now our relationship has become stronger than ever. Pain has a way of making us do things we normally wouldn't. It's not a teenage impulse, it's trying to find a way to cope through the pain of losing someone close, and when you're a teenager, you can't rationalize the concept of loss to that extent. For OP to just shut out his daughter like this because she left at a point where literally her whole entire life had fallen apart is so obscene that I cannot help but feel a seething rage about it. She not only lost a brother, she lost a family as well, and within months of each other. There is nothing relating to age with this impulse. This is purely a defense mechanism to that level of emotional pain and, dare I say it, abuse from OP. He was so focused on his dying son that he failed to see how much damage was going on at home because of it. \n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not attacking OP for that decision. He stood by him as long as he could, it just ended up being futile in the end. It's not standing by his daughters in the end that I am faulting him for though.

She lashed out in that pain, and instead of being a father, a pillar in the storm that was her life and someone who was willing to show her that everything was still all right, she was still loved and appreciated and they were going to get through it together, OP let her go, to the point that he actually DID replace her with his stepdaughters.

I feel like we're not getting anywhere near the whole story here.", "Why do assume monetary reasons?

Don't you find it a tad convenient that the parent she chose, despite her being the one who broke the family up, was the wealthy one? And now she's angry about that parent letting her down and taking it out on the parent who's keeping her from being homeless. The thanks the OP gets is being told she can't wait to leave.\n\nAt some point even a parent gets tired of being a punching bag.\n\nNTA", "Good point. I also failed to take into account that we are not likely getting the full story here when OP says that she moved in with her mom because she was more spoiled there. There\u2019s likely something missing from this story.", "[deleted]", "She's an adult who tells OP she doesn't want a relationship with him, then gets angry because he's not treating her like a princess.", "And yet for whatever reason the daughter needs to live with them.

Like you have completely different expectations / perceptions of what's what. \n\nDid she express any regret, and did it sound genuine to you?", "Totally missed that.  Oops!  Doesn\u2019t change my vote.", "Sounds like he is just providing shelter for an adult daughter who hates him and the rest of the family.

That's her dad. She didn't have to live there but she could have still kept contact, but because she was being spoiled she's ended up rotten.

Amy acts like an entitled, selfish little $hit, openly renounces her father/family, goes NC, then comes back because her $hitty, cheating mother and stepfather made some awful choices, but OP is in the wrong because he won\u2019t put up with her bull$hit. Some people are just bad apples, Amy sounds like one of those. Yes, she had some tragedy in her life but many people do and manage NOT to be complete AH to others. You are giving a free pass to a spoiled, selfish brat who should be grateful that her father took her in instead of demanding love she rejected.

She already chose to live with the cheater and the wealthy guy fulltime when op met his new wife. \n\"Finding shelter\"..she actively chose to go to her mother. Op didn't throw her out or anything..then she decided to say some mean things and go NC for quite some time. And ONLY came back because she absolutely had to because her decision to live with the mother bit her in the ass and then has a surprised Pikachu face when it's suddenly not happy family time anymore when she doesn't get treated like the lovely lost daughter. \nDid she expect OP to give her the biggest room in an established Household and not having to buy her own stuff? \nSeriously..it's absolutely horrible that they lost a son/brother and it might not be optimal in the slightest..but you can't opt out of someone's life and then come back (only because you absolutely have to) and demand to be treated like every other person of ops family when you made it absolutely clear that you don't want to be a part of it.", "I'm not saying it is justified nor that it doesn't have consequences. I'd know that first hand, when I lashed out and racked up 3 counts of domestic as a minor and one as an adult because of the pain of losing my grandfather, who was like a second father to me, was too much and I, being a freshmen at the time, couldn't rationalize he was gone until I was 23. I don't justify or excuse my reactions. But I DO know that what helped me pull my head out of my ass was having a support team in the form of my parents, who had my back the entire time, despite being an egregious asshole to them for 4+ years.\n\nThe point here is, he's her father. She's alone. She has had her life flipped inside out and round and round for 5 years now. She desperately needs someone who can be her sounding block, her support team, and get her through this before she makes a mistake there is no coming back from in her misery. OP has the chance here to be that person for her now. One of my biggest regrets was not stopping to see that the people I was abusing at home was the very people who had my back the entire time, and all I needed to do was talk to them. Perhaps I'm just sympathetic to what she's gong through as someone who has been in her shoes before.", "From my understanding the therapy was recent meaning as an adult not as a child. So she wasn't given the proper therapy she needed as a child to process everything. Likely she was lashing out at 14 because she just watched her brother go thru cancer then die from it and the step dad provided an outlet so she could pretend she was good. Money is a damn good way to make a grieving child mask everything. Love bombing was happening on top of it (step dad buying her affection essentially to make it easier on him instead of trying to bond the right way)\n\nFamily therapy wasn't my idea. I was thinking more a child therapiat for her directly so she could process it all. Cause you gotta think of her situation as this, brother gets cancer then dies then months later she suddenly has a new step mother and step siblings and it feels like everyone else was moving on and accepting things as fine and she couldn't. So she internalized all those negative emotions and it overcame on her personality and the step father love bombing her made it easier to mask cause no one was sitting her down and having a proper heart to heart. \n\nShe was a 14yr old going thru major trauma and it feels like she was left behind. Both parents left her in the rearview mirror and she was left to pick up her own pieces.\n\nNow as an adult she has access to her own therapist and needs to attend personal counseling before she goes to family therapy and needs to take accountability for her shit. I won't argue that. But it honestly feels like she's still stuck in that 14yr old mindset of being everyone's last thought and not cared about and forgotten. She likely feels like OP gave her up to replace her with his new family so soon. \n\nI do agree she has some asshole qualities about her she needs to work on and make amends for. I will agree with that. But ultimately so does OP. Because I read it as he gave up on her when it got hard. And is barely tolerating her now.", "OP also went through a lot: he lost his son, his wife cheated on him and his daugher replaced him with a stepdad (who's also the affair partner). Now, after she's an adult she came back and let Very clear that IS only because she needs a place to stay.", "Are you seriously arguing that he should've stay after she cheated on him?", ">And your therapist thought it was a fine idea for y'all to split? \n\nSorry can you explain this sentence? Do you mean split as in divorce?", "And do you know how many times I have lashed out similarly because of the grief I was stricken with at that point due to losing my grandpa like I've mentioned a couple times here? The psychology here is off for this to be what she actually means. I've been in that mindset myself, I know how it goes. You're so lost in the chaos of your own mind that you want a way out, but the pride of young adulthood keeps you from asking, so you put up walls, thinking that it will just go away, when it never does. In my case I had a parent who was able to come along and help me see that I didn't have to go it alone before I did something in a fit of pride filled spiteful anger there was no coming back from. She has no one...but she could have her father.", "Nah. The start would be the father, OP, realizing that when her life was flipped upside down she was still a minor who had next to no ability to rationalize how her world was caving in, just that it was imploding, and not to turn his back on her when she needed him most, because she slowly watched her twin die, her mom cheat and get arrested, and her parents split up. Then from there, actually be a father to her and begin working to heal the rift between them. Her life has flipped upside down 4 times in the last 5 years, and she has no one she can lean on for support. OP can make up for the last 5 years here.", "Yes, for whatever reason, but still she's a grownup and capable of having a job and make a life... she's not a kid anymore. Keep in mind this daughter came to them as a last resort. That also says a lot.\n\nAnd even though the OPs way of dealing with the situation wasn't good, it seems her daughter felt entitled from the very beginning in spite of being given a roof and not having apologized for what she did. (\"Well ever since she left there have been a lot of changes to the house. And Amy has been complaining about them since she arrived.\"... like, seriously??).", "And what about the respect OP deserves? Imagine a 21 year old moving in with you and telling you \"I don't want a relationship with you, I'm just desperate.\" Sounds like the daughter, as an adult, remains hateful and wants nothing to do with the family, yet expects equal treatment.", "We went to therapy. I took them out for one on one bonding once a month and family bonding 2x a month. All this was going on till she left.", "For her and Charlie since they are adults and have jobs. Then again I'd let them eat from the pantry if they're actually hungry but they're not allowed to \"Oh look there's some Doritos, let me eat it because I'm craving Doritos\"", "You mean ESH", "She expressed no regrets", "I agree!", "Edited my original post", "I mean, I\u2019m not sure what more you want him to do? He tried therapy with her when she returned to see if they could salvage a relationship, and she promptly insulted his wife during the session. She wants to be invited to the NYE party, hosted by OP\u2019s in laws, who she insulted at Christmas. He allows her to stay in the home when she needs a roof over her head, and she tells him that she wants nothing to do with him and only accepted because she\u2019s desperate\u2026.\n\nAnd as for having nobody - yes, her mom is in jail right now, but she\u2019s had her and step dad for the last few years. She has her sister. She had the therapist OP set her up with before the divorce and recently.", "I commented on the wrong comment\u2026 sorry", "The brother wasn't Amy's twin. He was Charlie's twin", "If OP wasn't trickle truthing the situation it would at best be ESH. As it stands there's clearly a reason or impetus for the daughters behavior they're not expressing and just dancing around.\n\nSpeaking _as_ a father, I don't care if my child is 2yo or 20yo, they're still my child even if they've hurt me and I cannot fathom ever attempting to treat them as OP has.", "So why at 21 is she coming to live with you? You're kinda trickle truthing the situation and it's hardening the idea that you know your behavior is inappropriate.", ">All this was going on till she left.\n\nAnd what about now that she's back?", "They are both assholes though.", "Did you have the impression she understood your point of view? What was hers?", "All good, accidents happen!", "Speaking as a father, I too think OP's A... but for not having a serious conversation from day one.\n\nI mean, if I were in a situation like that one with one of my daughters, I couldn't treat her as if nothing's ever happened but I would definitely have a talk about what she did, what she can initially expect, what she should learn from the whole thing and how she could make things right, especially for her own well being.\n\nBut at 21 years of age? At such an age, I would still expect a minimum level of responsibility from her. Me being the father doesn't mean I have to solve all her problems every single time.", "She doesn't have anywhere to go. She's only staying the dorm paperwork is done and I only let her stay because our country doesn't have homeless shelters. Also I'm Asian. Kids stay in their parents house till they're 30 or get married", "We haven't done anything. We tried therapy at first when she came, just to see if our relationship could be mended, but she insulted my wife in the first session we had. I stopped after that", "Your vote doesn\u2019t count if you refuse to abide by the voting rules.", "I guess I'm incorporating OPs whole comments. I currently don't actually see any evidence that she's acting out in any truly disastrous ways. She made childish decisions for childish reasons and acted with the haste and stupidity of a child. She was NC with her dad, and frankly from his comments and complete lack of empathy surrounding the death of his son I honestly don't think the current animosity now that she's an adult is undeserved. Clearly he views his family as possessions which owe _him_ respect and not as human with emotional needs.", "So you feel only a social obligation to her. Let her know that so she knows not to bother changing her mind. You had a chance to possibly repair this, but doesn't seem like there's a will to do it. Good luck, the remaining time with her living with you will be difficult.", "[deleted]", "You need to bear in mind the situation here, OP. Not only did she lose a brother and had to see him suffer in agony while you worked to the bone and your ex brought another man into your bed, she also had to endure you and your ex going through what sounds like a messy divorce. She was in pain and her entire world collapsed. And now she has to get used to a stepmom in a world where she still is likely feeling the pain of losing a sibling to cancer. No one can just push through that alone. She's in pain, and crying out for help, and all she's getting from the one man who can do something to help, you, HER FUCKING FATHER, is a door. You're more than just an asshole, OP, you're a manipulative, abusive jackass. You frankly DESERVE this. \n\nI lost my grandfather, who was like a second father to me, around the same time she lost her brother. I was not only insulting, I was abusive and uncontrollable because of the pain of losing a man who was an anchor in my life. For me it was a cry for help in a time where I didn't know how to do so. But never did my folks abandon me like you did her, they stood by me and we came out the other side stronger than ever because of it. I don't know what I would do without having my parents as emotional support. You have a chance to do that same thing for your daughter, and you're refusing. I have no words to describe how despicable you are, OP.", "So you're not *actually* trying then?", "But everyone here doesn't suck, just him and his daughter. His wife/her stepmother did the right thing by encouraging him to allow her to stay and reconnect. She's and her kids are putting up with a spouse/step-dad that would rather turn his own flesh and blood away because of a rash teenagers decision (and to be honest, probably wasnt even that rash, we just get his side of it \"because she was spoiled there\"). On top of that, they are dealing with a pouty spoiled adult that they have no real connection to coming into thier home and causing problems.  Saying everyone sucks here pulls them into it, and I don't think they suck. But I do think both the dad and daughter are huge assholes", "Yes. I might be the AH for it but she insulted my family after she left and when she came back again.
