The fact that your boyfriend decided to pick a fight and call you disrespectful for making sure you had something in your stomach is a red flag. Just saying. His vague response and the fact that they only had salad and bread means you did the absolute right thing for yourself. \n\nI wouldn't call him super nice and sweet. Not at all.", "NTA.  His family proved you right.  They didn't have options for you.  You live with being a vegetarian, you know how it is and you accommodate for it.  He needs to see that you were right and that you can handle what you put into your body.  Which is no one else's business and for no one else to judge.  Thanks BF, I got this.", "If he\u2019s vague about things that you have made clear are important- food is a big deal and he put you in a situation where assumptions were made.\n\nHis arguing with you is a deflection from the simple responsibility of sharing the information with his family that you don\u2019t eat meat and being specific about what you do eat. If this is problematic for them, it\u2019s a \ud83d\udea9, along with the hostility coming from him. Accommodating a guest\u2019s preferences goes to wanting them to feel welcome- he kept this from happening. He\u2019s the AH. YWNBTA", "1.

Salad and bread :( \n\nHis family would never know you ate before unless he told them, so how could it be disrespectful. I cant see any logic in his position.", "NTA.  Why didn't you press your boyfriend about what would be on the menu that you could eat?  Seems to me like that's something you should have been assertive on.", "Nope. NTA.", ">my bf got so mad at me.

You\u2019ve learned from experience that people who aren\u2019t vegetarians don\u2019t always think about the needs of vegetarians.

You have got into a habit that ensures you can socialise without starving yourself when people don\u2019t have options. He didn\u2019t provide you any real assurances you\u2019d be catered to and the reality was that you weren\u2019t. And tbf vegetarian isn\u2019t that difficult, as long as you\u2019re not super picky, but I think your approach is sensible and polite.

Inviting someone to a dinner party and then not providing them dinner just shows they don\u2019t respect you. \n\n\nIt\u2019s bothersome that you might even slightly feel you did something wrong.

You make sure you're covered in case options there aren't plentiful for you.  \n\n\nAnd what do you know?!

You asked him if there would be options for you and he didn't or couldn't answer so I don't know why he'd be mad. Turned out salad and bread don't make a whole dinner party meal so good thing you ate something before. Unless you would be totally fine with just those two things to eat  I guess. Clearly he did NOT inform his family about you being vegetarian or he did and they didn't care. Either way I don't see what you did wrong but I see lots of ways that your bf dropped the ball and/or failed to make sure you were fed.", "NTA. Its a trick lots of people employ because we don't want to go hungry. Its not disrespectful to feed yourself unbeknownst to a dinner party host before you arrive. Its just self-protection. (Who hasn't been to the dinner party of someone who is not a great cook? It seems we all have at some point, and you know you better eat something before you leave your own home, so you can enjoy socializing without worry over the potato salad with raisins and cranberries as your only option.\n\nYour BF is being goofy IMO. If you have dietary restrictions its always best to be prepared and be polite.", "nta. he didn\u2019t tell his family you were a vegetarian, even though you reminded him, even though he admits they eat a lot of meat, *or* he did tell them and they didn\u2019t give a shit, and when there was no dinner for you to eat at the dinner party, he was pissed at you for not going hungry. i would keep thinking about the future, and picture every event where you will either go hungry or be told how disrespectful you are. \n\nam i the only one who suspects this is the kind of bf who expects you to start eating the same food he does after you\u2019ve been together for a while?", "NTA at all. He didn't even try to understand how hard it is for you to go to dinner parties given how you eat, or the position it would have put you in if you had gone to the party hungry and not been able to eat more than salad. This guy seems to lack empathy and awareness."]}
