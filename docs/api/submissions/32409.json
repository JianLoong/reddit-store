Either way I don't see what you did wrong but I see lots of ways that your bf dropped the ball and/or failed to make sure you were fed.", "NTA. Its a trick lots of people employ because we don't want to go hungry. Its not disrespectful to feed yourself unbeknownst to a dinner party host before you arrive. Its just self-protection.

He literally didn\u2019t care if you got to eat. Give him another 24 hrs to apologize, then break up with him.", "NTA. As a person with dietary limitations and a tendency to get a migraine from skipping meals, I'm a big, big fan of people eating before going anywhere they're not sure about. It's a great strategy to help ensure you're at your best, and that's really important in many situations - from meeting your significant other's family, to having a successful business lunch. Even if you had walked in and found a 100% vegetarian feast, eating ahead of time would have been the right choice, because you weren't confident of what to expect. It's far easier to do it your way, than having to play nice when you're really hungry, and then having to make and eat a rushed, late dinner at home later.\n\nYou might have a couple of things going on here. Your partner said you were wrong to assume that they wouldn't have food for you -- but it turned out you were absolutely right, because they didn't have food for you, other than a couple side items. If being around vegetarians is new to your partner, he may not know that a bowl of lettuce and a dinner roll aren't a main course. I have known many people who don't know what goes into building nutritionally complete meals without meat, and they have this idea that \"vegetarian\" means someone who only eats bread, soda, and those token side salads that are only there to make the menu picture look healthier.\n\nYou say he also got upset that eating ahead of time was disrespectful. He may have been taught that when you're invited to someone's home for dinner, one way you show respect to your host is by being hungry and eating what they serve. He's right, but that only works if the host serves food that you can eat - without causing severe stomach upset, and without setting yourself up for a carb overload/crash cycle. You did the right thing, and it may be that the problem here is a lack of understanding, and maybe some mistaken assumptions, on his part.\n\nThat said, though, please also keep in mind that his vague responses, and his failure to be proactive to ensure there was something you could use as a main course, can also be warning flags that he may not be as good a match as you think. You need a partner who supports your need to not suffer through every family gathering in hangry-mode, and this guy will have to decide (and demonstrate!!) whether or not he can be that partner for you.", "\"his family is heavy on meat but he told me it'll be okay.\"\n\nTranslation: you will have to be okay with whatever they serve because your food preference is less important to him than asking his family to provide some veggie options for you.", "NTA \u2014 after he saw what was available, he should have recognized the truth to what you said and apologized. If not, I would say that he\u2019s clearly not capable of growing into a good partner for you.", "NTA \n\nLots of people giving good advice here, but I was wondering how his parents felt that you clearly didn't have adequate food at a dinner party they invited you to? Any murmurs? Any \"well why didn't (BF) tell us?\" etc? Because I would be horrified. Sounds like they went out of their way to get you a nice dessert....or did it just happen to be vegetarian? \n\nDid they try to get you to try the main course? Was the main grilled t bone steaks?

She sends it home with my husband for me to eat later.\nNTA", "NTA; you handled this the best way possible.

The way he handled this suggests you should take a second look at how he\u2019s behaved through your relationship.", "NTA, I was taught by my parents to always eat before you go to a dinner party/ event in case there isn\u2019t enough food, or there is some reason that pushes the food to come out late.

His reaction was way over the top and if by some miracle he did tell his folks you are a vegetarian, they're dicks too!", "I'm not vegetarian anymore, but when I was I went to a dinner party where I could only eat bread. The host swore he'd make plenty of things I could eat. When I got there, he said he'd made some green beans, potato soup and a nice salad especially for me. Well, he made green beans with bacon for everyone else. Mine was just green beans but still fried in bacon grease. The salad was the same for everyone and had bacon grease mixed in with it like a dressing. The soup was made with chicken stock.\n\nHe honestly couldn't understand why I wouldn't eat any of it. His exact words were \"It's just bacon grease and stock. There isn't any actual meat in it.\"", "Bacon grease is not dressing *bacon grease is not dressing* BACON GREASE IS NOT DRESSING\n\nChrist that's gross", "I am raging on your behalf and I am not vegetarian, lol.\n\nIt's not hard to roast a pan of veggies in olive oil in the oven and everyone likes them.\n\nI do however have migraine triggers and foods I avoid because of health issues (gluten and dairy, I am eyeing you).

I like bacon and I like salad but that sounds horrifying? Was it just all congealed? My mind is just boggled.", "A surprising number of people believe it is. I've known lots of people that made a wilted spinach and bacon salad. You pour hot bacon grease on the spinach so it slightly wilts. I've also seen in it on the menu in multiple restaurants.", "Chef here. It is, indeed, an ingredient of the dressing for a specific wilted spinach salad. \n\nI serve mine in individual bowls with a fried egg on top. My mom called it \u201cbacon and egg salad\u201d and it was one of her favorite things.\n\nSo, yeah, sorry. It\u2019s an actual thing and not uncommon. The bacon grease is technically the fat for a warm vinaigrette dressing.\n\nNo different from any other emulsified vinaigrette dressing, actually.", "I wrote about it in another comment, but it's a wilted spinach salad. It was fairly popular in the early 2000s. Basically you just pour hot bacon grease over fresh baby spinach so the leaves wilt. It's then served immediately while it's still partially warm so you can eat it before the grease congeals. I was a chef at a fairly nice restaurant years ago that served it and you'll still occasionally find it on the menu at some wannabe fancy restaurants.\n\nETA: You don't use all that much grease since you only want some of the leaves to wilt. Not everything to get cooked and soggy", "\ud83e\udd2e", "It still doesn't sound good to me but I'm glad it's not cold."]}
