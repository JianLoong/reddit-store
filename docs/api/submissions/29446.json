{"id": 29446, "submission_id": "17dsa60", "title": "AITA for not wanting to provide food/ serve food/ cleanup at my ex's wedding", "selftext": "So a bit of background before the main event. My ex and I split about seven years ago but remained good friends. We are part of a group of friends that meet up around four times a year.\n\nBack in early summer, we were invited to my ex's birthday party. My fiance and I arrived and the first thing that happened was that we were excitedly introduced to his new girlfriend whom he had been on three dates with in as many weeks. We thought it was a bit early for introductions and that the whole situation was a bit weird and intense but he's always been very emotionally immature so I wasn't that surprised. .. But I digress, I'm not here to judge his love life. \n\nAnyway, literally two months later, we got the message that they were getting married and the wedding was this coming weekend (so in about two and half months at the time). Again, we thought it was a bit strange, a bit fast and a bit weird, but, again, it's his life, who are we to judge?\n\nThe one thing that irritated me about the whole thing was that they had a gift lift filled with the most stupidly expensive items. I mean, we're already having to travel to the event, drive for over an hour between ceremony and reception, stay at a hotel and I'm having to bring my own food due to a dietary requirement that can't be catered for. The cheapest thing on the list was about \u00a385. \n \nAnyway, two days ago, exactly a week before the big day, I received an email asking if I could bring a large homemade cake that was also vegan and gluten free. I was also informed that I was expected to serve the food, clean up after the food, make teas and coffees and wash up as 'my contribution to help out'.\n\nNow, there's absolutely nothing wrong with keeping costs down and asking people to bring food for a 'bring and share' (even though technically due to my dietary requirements I can't share). However, I thought that a week's notice was really cheeky. I also think that it's really bad to ask your guests to serve food and clean up at your wedding. My partner is furious and both of us are now seriously considering not attending. I've spoken to some of our mutual friends and everybody has been asked to do similar things and nobody is thrilled but everyone else seems to be going along with it to keep the peace. \n\nI really want to see my friends next weekend and tbh I do have a fear of missing out on the event but I'm so annoyed with my ex for being so tight and not actually proving food/ staff but still expecting an expensive gift. \n\nAITA here? Should I just suck it up and just go along with it? I wasn't going to make a big fuss on the day or anything - I'm generally quite passive and I wouldn't deliberately spoil the day for him.

With all due respect, grow the fuck up. You're afraid of missing a wedding that's going to go south very quickly. Asking people to serve food at your wedding is classless and gross.", "NTA \n\nOmg do not go. This is the tackiest and rudest thing ever. Yeah the FOMO will be real because this is going to be the cringiest wedding ever but just get your friends to take all the pictures for you.", "NTA, him being your ex is completely irrelevant here, all your friends should be pushing back on this, you shouldn't be expected to do this stuff for someone's wedding, you're guests.", "NTA, say you got sick and can't make it.", "NTA this is soooo rude and tacky and all kinds of things. I would opt out of it entirely and not go or send a gift. They are trying to take advantage of people - don\u2019t let them.", "NTA\nWhy would you even attend?  Why is anybody attending?  I can stay home and serve myself, clean up after myself and it doesn't cost me a penny more than any other day. That's a ridiculous thing to ask.", "What do you fear missing out on? A garbage wedding?\n\nSpend the weekend doing something nice with your partner instead of worrying about his train wreck.", "NTA\n\nSave yourself the money and stress and don't attend at all.  You'll see your friends another time.  The friends that attend can share their stories about this train wreck.\n\nIf you do attend, take your own meals as you had planned but don't take a cake and don't serve or clean up.  You're a guest, not staff.  Absolutely don't cater to their outrageous entitlement.", "NTA, I'm not sure I'd still want to go.

Go to his second wedding.", "You're not the asshole for feeling uncomfortable about the situation, and your concerns are valid. Your ex's request for guests to provide and serve food at the wedding, especially with such short notice, is unusual and could make many people feel uncomfortable.  \nIt's important to communicate your concerns and boundaries with your ex and your mutual friends. Express your feelings about the short notice and the expectation for guests to provide and serve food, especially considering your dietary requirements. It's reasonable to have reservations about attending an event that makes you feel like you're being used for your contributions rather than being a guest celebrating a special day.  \nYou can consider discussing this with your ex or the mutual friends to see if there's a way to make the situation more reasonable and comfortable for all involved. If you choose not to attend due to your discomfort, it's entirely understandable, and you're not in the wrong for prioritizing your own feelings and boundaries in this situation. Your own comfort and happiness should be taken into account when deciding whether or not to attend the wedding.", "Not the asshole", "NTA. \n\nI think you are going to have to choose between going and doing some work as everyone is being asked to help, or not going. \n\nEither way, you can definitely decline to do the cake, with a simple \"I'm sorry, I don't have the time to get a cake like that together (or expertise if that is true) but I look forward to seeing you next week.\" And leave it at that. If they asked you to buy a cake and you want to go, then buy a cake but make THAT your wedding present. \n\nI've been to these homespun weddings where they do ask people to do some stuff, but usually it is with more notice and usually they just ask people to do one thing- who can come early for setup, who can provide food, who can help serve, who can be the bartender, who can stay for clean up. \n\nIf everyone is being asked to help, then you aren't being singled out, but you can still decide this doesn't seem fun and you don't want to go. And like I said, you can decline to bake a cake even if you go, and you also don't have to buy an expensive wedding present- either make a store bought cake your contribution or you can get them something not on their registry and call it a day.", "NTA\n\nJust say, sorry, can\u2019t attend.  Something has come up.    \nAsking you to bring a specific cake, that you cannot even eat, and asking you to do all the work just screams of being cheap.", "Honestly, once I saw the gift list on top of the travel, I would have declined.

Kindly tell them that unfortunately the jobs they have asked you to do will not work for you.  Refuse to explain and if it is a requirement then politely state you will therefore not be able to attend.  Do not argue. Do not explain.  Just repeat sorry that just won't work for me. Be a doormat or don't. Your choice.  Next they will expect you to be an unpaid babysitter, pet watcher and house sitter. Stand up now or it will be harder later after you have been their free sevant and baker. Won't kill you to miss one event with friends.", "NTA. This kind of expectation should have been made clear at the beginning so people could make an informed decision to attend. It shouldn\u2019t be thrown at you this late in the game when people have already committed time and money into travel, accommodation, gifts etc.\n\nI have been to a wedding where people were asked to help with catering. However that was made super clear at the beginning as there was no expectation from the couple to provide a gift on top, and money was offered for ingredients etc. How your ex has gone about it is wrong on so many levels.\n\nOn a personal note the bit where you were asked to make a vegan cake last minute gave me flashbacks to a different wedding where the bride asked me to make a vegan cake with less than two weeks notice. I did it, it was stressful and I was never offered anything to pay for ingredients, decorations etc. I will never do it again.", "Oh! Your Aunt Myrtle unexpectedly passed, and your mother needs you desperately! Didn\u2019t know you even  had an Aunt Myrtle? No matter. Just murmur\u2014on high-quality note paper\u2014that you can\u2019t make your ex\u2019s nups, and that you\u2019re ever so sorry.\n\nYour ex is on his own.

Do you want to travel for a potluck with your friends? \n\nIf you do, I also think you get to pick how you support the new couple. If I\u2019m helping with a cake, that\u2019s my gift.

It would be a lot cheaper and more pleasant.", "Why do you even want to go? The invitation is not really an \"invite\" like?? Block and move on. Why do you need reddit for this.
