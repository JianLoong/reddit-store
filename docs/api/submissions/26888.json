Takes that other culture idea makes it their own verision then sell back their verison to the culture which they got the idea from in the first place. For example anime came from americian's animation or cartoon. They turned into their style of art work. They were parctically inspired by disney himself. Another example is a lot of their foods. Such as ice cream. Ice cream deserts even galeto came from europe. They have taken all its from from itlay's galeto. Crepes and ice cream from france. Even americians and their cream cones. They take these ideas and made their own verision theme shops and now you find these verisions all over americia where the idea came from to start. Their whole school system which truly started in the fifties came from a blend of british schools, americian schools and france. Their milatary is a blend of chinese and a little german. Their valentines day is a twist from the west idea of it. Instead of boys give the girls gifts and date nights to their girlfriends. And have it be a couples day, it is a chance to create your own romance by giving chocolate to your crush. And christmas is more like America's valentines days in some ways. They still kept a lot of their older traditions. Some are even mordernize such as arranged marriage meetings where two sets of parents arrange a meeting between two unmarried adult children. However a lot of their culture as they know it now came from another culture. I guess you can argue america is like that too. However americia is a little different. We are not one united culture moving more or less together. But a culture of the cultures. In other worlds people who origanally come from else where kept their culture roots while living next to other cultures. Like a jewish family, buddest family, catholic family, japenese or black family all share one neighboorhood or space in some way. Where they practice their roots and do not adapt or try to discourage their culture. However when you have a blend of ideas of how to live or tradtions. Naturally those ideas might become part of other households that do not respresent the orgin which it came from. It is not a bad thing. Not really.

If you identify as Japanese than you are.  Even more so if you were actually born there and can speak the language.  The way I see it, concepts of \"nationality\" are antiquated and thus the notion of belonging to a nation due to blood ties is antiquated.  For me, a non-Asian person who just got off the plane can be just as Japanese, if not more so, than someone who has lived in Japan or any other East Asian country for there entire live's.  This is because in the realm of the postmodern condition, the notion of action-becoming-understanding is no longer a fixed entity but rather a more often than not the sum of one's of perceptions, experiences, and narratives. In other words, reality is merely the sum of internalized and experientialized preconceptions. We can, and often do, possess multiple identities, each as valid as the other.\n\nConsider, for instance, someone like myself.  I am a son, but I am also a grandson and a brother.  I am soon to be a husband and father.  Each of these identities represents a facet of their being, a role they inhabit at different moments in their life. These identities are not in competition or contradiction; rather, they coexist harmoniously, each contributing to the rich tapestry of their existence. In the absence of a singular, overarching truth, these identities are equally valid and valuable expressions of self.\n\nAs we embrace the concept of liberation from constraining constructs like race, nation, and gender, we find ourselves entwined in a complex web of the cycle of meaning-creation and rebirth. Here, individual identity-reality is not confined to preconceived notions, but rather exists through the power of speech and self-perception. It is through our own beliefs and declarations that our identities truly take form and evolve.\n\nThese narratives are not just individual constructs but are interwoven with the narratives of others, forming a complex web of perspectives and truths. In this web, there is no hierarchy of identities, no superior or inferior way to define oneself. Instead, there is an acknowledgment of the plurality of human experience, where each narrative contributes to the collective understanding of our multifaceted existence.\n\nFor me, I live in Taiwan and though I do not officially hold Taiwanese citizenship or speak the language, I identify as Taiwanese especially when it comes to defending the Taiwanese people against the barbarism of the evil CCP.  Embracing the fluidity of identity should not be met with apprehension, but rather embraced as a transformative opportunity. This fluidity allows us to embark on journeys of self-discovery, facilitating personal growth and expanding our understanding of who we truly are. No longer confined to a single prescribed identity, we are free to explore different facets of ourselves, experiment with new roles and perspectives, and surpass societal expectations. Through the fluidity of our identities, we liberate ourselves from the constricting chains of conformity, reject limiting labels, and bask in the richness and diversity of the human experience.\n\nAlso: In a broader context, when we examine the historical underpinnings of identity and its relation to authoritarianism, a striking pattern emerges. The restriction of identity, often manifesting in the form of rigid and narrow frameworks, has frequently served as a tool of control and domination by authoritarian regimes. These authoritarian ideologies attempt to subsume the individual beneath a constructed national or religious identity, leaving little room for the nuanced complexities of human existence.\n\nAuthoritarian regimes thrive on the establishment and maintenance of a singular, homogenized identity for their subjects. They employ this tactic to consolidate power, suppress dissent, and create a conformist society. In such environments, the individual's identity is prescribed and tightly controlled, leaving little room for personal autonomy or self-expression. This not only stifles creativity and diversity but also erodes the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.\n\nThis fluidity of identity, which the West is now embracing, also poses a direct threat to authoritarianism. Authoritarian regimes fear the empowerment of individuals through the actualization of their diverse identities. They are acutely aware that when people recognize the multifaceted nature of their identity, they become less susceptible to manipulation and control. The ability to question oppressive structures, assert personal autonomy, and demand inclusivity is amplified when the rigid categories of identity are disrupted.", "NTA lmao\n\nAmericans (and as a Canadian, Canadians too, tbh) are so weird about heritage.

You've got to understand the perspective of people from settler colonies like Australia, America, Canada, New Zealand etc, comes from a very different place.

Our culture did not integrate into another culture, it is almost completely derived from other cultures that are on the other side of the planet.

Dutch pay in what way?\".\n\nAnother key point is that many groups in the US do not have a \"cultural mother country\" separate from their place of nationality/residency to trust to be kind of cultural caretakers and advocates for them.  Native Americans only have their currently occupied land, African-Americans have been purposefully cut from their African roots and are rooted in the US. So while recent Dutch immigrants largely do not care or even find hilarious the misconceptions and borrowings in America, this is because they know there will always be a place where the truth is understood.\n\nSo certain minority-majority dynamics are very different from say if a Flemish guy in Belgium decided to mix things up with some old French fashion or something.
