Takes that other culture idea makes it their own verision then sell back their verison to the culture which they got the idea from in the first place. For example anime came from americian's animation or cartoon. They turned into their style of art work. They were parctically inspired by disney himself. Another example is a lot of their foods. Such as ice cream. Ice cream deserts even galeto came from europe. They have taken all its from from itlay's galeto. Crepes and ice cream from france. Even americians and their cream cones. They take these ideas and made their own verision theme shops and now you find these verisions all over americia where the idea came from to start. Their whole school system which truly started in the fifties came from a blend of british schools, americian schools and france. Their milatary is a blend of chinese and a little german. Their valentines day is a twist from the west idea of it. Instead of boys give the girls gifts and date nights to their girlfriends. And have it be a couples day, it is a chance to create your own romance by giving chocolate to your crush. And christmas is more like America's valentines days in some ways. They still kept a lot of their older traditions. Some are even mordernize such as arranged marriage meetings where two sets of parents arrange a meeting between two unmarried adult children. However a lot of their culture as they know it now came from another culture. I guess you can argue america is like that too. However americia is a little different. We are not one united culture moving more or less together. But a culture of the cultures. In other worlds people who origanally come from else where kept their culture roots while living next to other cultures. Like a jewish family, buddest family, catholic family, japenese or black family all share one neighboorhood or space in some way. Where they practice their roots and do not adapt or try to discourage their culture. However when you have a blend of ideas of how to live or tradtions. Naturally those ideas might become part of other households that do not respresent the orgin which it came from. It is not a bad thing. Not really.

But it isn't like non-japanese people are shunned here.", "Because the kid is in college and live there for 14 years, so basically was born, was raised and lived in that culture most of her life. That is the only society she has been surrounded by and lived in mist of her life, that is were she learn and picked her cultural societal norms. A lot of her culture is japanese, supplemented by her parents own cultures probably.\nRegardless of if others want to accept her or not culturally she is japanese because that is the environment she grew in. And it is super sad, the amount of people telling her \"japanese people don't see you as one of them, it's part of their culture. \" People not welcoming gaijin is such a outdated concept, most people aren't that closed minded nowadays, especially to someone raised there nearly their whole life.", "Maybe you should re-read my comments and stop putting words in my mouth", ">Yes. Yes i would? LOL \n\nOkay, then you're fucking nuts and we have nothing further to discuss.", "I\u2019m aware Japan is a pretty discriminatory place.", "She is culturally Japanese. Just because Japan is a xenophobic society doesn\u2019t invalidate the fact that she was born and raised there for most of her life, unless she was raised in seclusion with very little contact with the environment around her and there is zero reason for us to believe that is the case. Sometimes even half-Japanese people in Japan aren\u2019t considered to be \u201creal\u201d Japanese by others, and they are literally Japanese by blood! There\u2019s no reason that OP should let the ignorance of others dictate which culture she belongs do.", "Were you born and raised there? Because that\u2019s my argument. I speak Spanish at a high level, and could move to Spain easily and integrate. I\u2019d never be Spanish though because I\u2019m not from there. \n\nYes, I know Japan is very discriminatory to foreigners.", "Sure they are.", "Hi, American living abroad. If you live in a country with a tax treaty, you only pay additional US taxes if you make over a certain *USD* threshold. In my current country, it's 100,000. I file every year (and have for over a decade) and have never paid an additional cent in taxes. My income is effectively 0 in the US.", "My most hated boss!", "LOL", "Ever had bully? An ex? Been the victim of a crime and know who did it?\n\nI have a list of names for this scenario.", ">basically was born, was raised and lived in that culture most of her life. That is the only society she has been surrounded by and lived in mist of her life, that is were she learn and picked her cultural societal norms. \n\nThat's a huge assumption for the child of expats in Japan. She more likely than not went to international schools and her peers and playmates were likely fellow foreign children. That's the typical experience for non-Japanese children in Japan. They aren't usually going to local hoikuen and elementary schools, speaking mostly Japanese and consuming mostly Japanese culture.\n\n>the amount of people telling her \"japanese people don't see you as one of them, it's part of their culture.\n\nI haven't said that at all, if this is pointed at me, and I don't agree with this view. What I am saying is you and others are making assumptions about her background that may not be very good assumptions at all. Has she said she considers herself Japanese? I haven't seen where she has, and it's irrelevant to the question she is asking.\n\n>People not welcoming gaijin is such a outdated concept, most people aren't that closed minded nowadays, especially to someone raised there nearly their whole life.\n\nI agree, but again, it depends entirely on how she was raised and how she identifies - I wouldn't presume to hazard a guess about that. I have several friends who have kids born here and have grown up here to this point, and in no way would those kids or their family consider themselves Japanese. Maybe OP does, I don't know.", "Chill, I thought you were the person I was responding to in the base comment, as that's what they said. Apologies.", "Nope, wasn't born and raised here, though I feel much more connection to life here than where I did grow up. Basically a different life.\n\n>Yes, I know Japan is very discriminatory to foreigners.\n\nOoh, that's not my point at all.  I'm saying that you can live in Japan for most of your life as a foreign person, speak Japanese, and still consider yourself a foreigner and not a part of Japanese culture. It's more common than not. It's pretty rare for the opposite i think, even the mixed race children born in Japan with Japanese citizenship may not consider themselves Japanese. \n\nPeople will react initially differently to people who don't seem to be Japanese (this is ambiguous in itself as you can be from many backgrounds and still be Japanese), but if you want to assimilate, you can do it. People will treat you the same as anyone else.", "Not by any Japanese standard.", "This guy files", "Dual citizen here...can confirm.  The tax treaty is the thing.  Still chaps my ass that I have to file even when living abroad though!", "There's a lot of ifs there. *If* you earn under a certain amount, *if* you live in certain countries and *if* you don't spend more than a month a year in another country you don't have to pay tax, but you do have to do a tax return every year. As opposed to the vast majority of countries, where if you don't live there you don't pay tax.\n\nSince a bunch of countries, mostly western, committed to helping the US enforce these laws in 2012, so many people with US citizenship renunciated it to the extent where appointments to give up your citizenship would need to be booked over a year in advance (in some places). \n\nLike, it's just such cope.", "That seems like an extremely alien and unnecessarily segregated way of looking at it. If you are from a place and that is the only cultural framework you\u2019ve ever had, you are part of that culture.", "Cool, then that standard is wrong.", "A little overstatement. There are about 10k people a year who renounce citizenship, but most of them are dual citizens who never actually lived in the US, like Boris Johnson.\n\nYou have to be pretty wealthy for it to actually hit you, even after the fairly large exemptions you get credit for tax paid abroad. although it's certainly annoyance to file.  And I say as someone who did it in Germany for a decade.", "There were literally only two ifs:\n\n1 - if you live in country that has the tax treaty\n\n2 - if you make over a certain amount\n\nNot a lot of ifs there at all.", "Also, renouncing your citizenship doesn't relieve you of your tax burden....the IRS always wins.", "Maybe? Identity is complicated, especially in Japan where traditionally its been a case of in-group or out-group. People who stride that line can find a lot of grey area.\n\nOne of my friends is 100% Japanese, Japanese parents, Todai grad no less, born and raised in Japan, but lived overseas for several years in junior high and university. He frequently feels a bit less than 100% Japanese and a bit more than 0% American. It's complicated. Look at someone like Rina Sawayama, Japanese citizen born to Japanese parents in Japan, spent early years in Japan and spoke Japanese at home in the UK - considers herself British. \n\nThere are many cultural frameworks in Japan, and especially among expats and their children its not so simple to say \"you grew up in Japan in Japanese culture\" Maybe, but also very likely not. \n\nWe don't know unless OP gives us some insight and I would hate to assume. It's frankly irrelevant to the question she is asking, though - she's not appropriating anything.", "You don\u2019t get to tell Japanese people they\u2019re doing their culture wrong\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"]}
