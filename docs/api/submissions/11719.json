We're 13f, 10m, 8m, 4f, 2f. Our mom went crazy and left us when my youngest sister was a month old. Our dad stuck around for maybe 5 months after that before dropping us off at our half sister's (25f) place for what was supposed to be a couple weeks then changing his number, deleting his email, and putting our house up for sale.\n\nMy sister was a full time college student and was living in a one bedroom apartment. She didn't have the space, time, or money to take care of us so we ended up in foster care until she either got a new apartment and a better job or CPS could track down my dad and get him to take us.\n\nWe were in foster care for 8 months then went back to my sister when she graduated college and got a bigger apartment. She takes really good care of us. We always have food, we have good clothes and my siblings have a lot of toys, and she always makes sure I can participate in every class party or field trip. It's been really rough for my sister though. She sleeps on the couch because she can't cram another bed into our rooms and she works 2 jobs. She's out of the house by 2 every morning, comes back by 8 to make us breakfast and get us to school or daycare, then goes back to work at 1. She says she doesn't get much help from our dad or the state.\n\nHe showed up at our apartment a few days ago. I answered the door, he tried to hug me, I told him to fuck off, then I shut the door in his face.\n\nMy sister came out of the bedroom and asked who it was and when I told her, she gave me $30 and told me to go to our babysitter's apartment and see if she'll let me stay with her for a couple hours. She picked me up from the babysitter's apartment and the only thing she said was \"did you curse at your dad\". I told her what happened and she said that she gets why I'm mad but she said I can't curse at him. I know I shouldn't have but I got into an argument with her because I was really upset and now I'm worried she's mad at me.", "created_utc": 1678207551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11l4c18/aita_for_telling_my_dad_to_fuck_off_when_he/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you did nothing wrong. Your father is a pile of crap and what he did to you and your elder sister is criminal.\n\nYou're very lucky to have an amazing sister. I am sure is is not mad at you. Just let her know that you know your dad is trash and that you appreciate her so much.", "NTA. Your sister should be mad at your dad, too. All of you have the right to be as mad at him as you want to, that includes cursing - He literally abandoned you. You don't owe him anything.", "NTA. Your sister told you not to curse at him?! What an absolute SAINT of a lady. IMO it is deserved. Your dad sounds like a real piece of work, leaving you all with your sister and then returning for hugs. Absolutely unacceptable.", "NTA, your father can sit and spin considering what he put you kids through.", "NTA \u2014 but neither is your sister for probably just worrying and not wanting you to get in the proverbial line of fire. Your dad is a major AH though and it is astonishing he is able to get away with total abandonment/not paying any support. Sending you/your sister/other siblings much love \u2014 your sister especially sounds like an amazing woman beyond her years. Don\u2019t worry: just talk to her and tell her how you feel when you\u2019re both calm.", "NTA. surprised that's all you did, shows how strong you are.", "NTA. He can fuck right off. You are under no obligation to treat him with deference after he walked away and left you no means of contact, as well as putting you through the foster system. That\u2019s despicable behavior. \n\nGood for you, OP.", "Nope - NTA. Your dad is. I\u2019m sorry you were abandoned by both parents. Your sister is a rock star, who gave up her life plans to raise five siblings.", "NTA \n\nYour dad is the only AH here. \n\nYou\u2019re upset and your sister gets that, but she might just want to protect you from your father and wants to make sure you\u2019re acting appropriately. She\u2019s had to become your parent, so she\u2019s gonna have to call you out if you\u2019re cursing at adults.", "NTA\n\nYour AH sperm donor---I would **NEVER** call that man a father--- deserved **far worse** than being cursed out.  After only 5 months as a single dad, he dumped all of you on your half-sister and vanished entirely.  When all of you needed him most.\n\nEven if he couldn't raise you, at a bare minimum, if he had provided child support, maybe you wouldn't have had to go into the foster care system at all.\n\nIn the meanwhile, your half-sister made **huge** sacrifices in her own life to take care of you.  Instead of starting her own life, now she's a single foster mother.  To five kids.  And will be for **at least** the next 16 years.  Think about that for a minute.  \n\n**Respect is earned, not given.**  Your sperm donor's vanishing entirely permanently deprives him of any right to **any** respect whatsoever.\n\nYour sister is absolutely NTA for her feelings on the matter, either.  She likely has a very strong belief that parents should be respected no matter what.  I personally, completely disagree with her viewpoint.", "damn, you're 13 yo. abandoned by ma; abandoned by pops. rescued by older sister. \n\nbig sis is an angel. \ud83e\uddda\n\nyou're at the cusp of womanhood moving away from childhood; adolescence, a tough stage of life.\n\nI don't think sister is overly upset with you. I think she may be concerned about having some of the resources that she needs to care for you and her other siblings being curtailed. If I read it right pops is giving some financial help, limited as it may be.", "NTA, I would've done the same. I wouldn't forgive or forget", "NTA for what you said to dad. He deserves it. Gentle Y T A for arguing with your sister about it. She's trying as hard as she can. Please don't make it harder for her, and just try to do as she asks.  Talk to her and apologize", "I'm going with NAH (except for your father, obviously).\n\nYou're not an AH for your reaction, many others would have done the same. Your father has let you down massively, and if your sister hadn't stepped up then you and your siblings would probably be separated across several different foster carers. Your anger is completely valid.\n\nBut also your sister isn't an AH either. You're 13, and there will no doubt be discussions between your sister and your father that you aren't privy to. Your sister may fear that your father will cut off what little financial support he's sending. She may worry that he'll take your reaction to mean that you're being raised badly and try to regain custody. Or perhaps he's already said he wants you all back and she knows that he'll be gathering evidence to this end.\n\nI'm sorry that this is putting you in an awkward position. Your sister is also young, and she has taken on a great deal of responsibility in a very short amount of time. She may not be thinking entirely clearly, she may be worried about letting your father back in your lives, or she may be feeling conflicted over rejecting his presence in your lives.\n\nI know this is hard, but try to give her some grace. At 13 you think you know everything (I know I did), but you're still lacking a great deal of the life experience that makes us all mature adults. Apologise to your sister for shouting at her, and explain how you feel. Tell her that you feel a great deal of hurt for the way your father abandoned you and that you're not ready to welcome him back into your life with open arms. Tell her that you appreciate her taking you all in when it's probably the hardest thing she's ever done in her life. Let her know that you can't just go straight back to being your father's daughter when there's so much hurt still inside you.\n\nI'm sure she will understand, I doubt she's his number 1 fan at the moment either. At the very least you can aim to get your feelings out in a constructive way without descending into yelling at her, no matter how satisfying you think it might be at the time.", "NTA. I don't think your sister is mad at you! She's probably disappointed that you cursed your father though. Just be as supportive of your sister as you can.  She loves all of you obviously.", "NTA but your sister is a saint! Despite all that is on your sister's plate, she has a presence of mind to not allow you to do things that may harm your chances for a relationship with your father in the future. Even if you do not want a relationship with him in the future, chances are once you are older you will want t have at least a conversation to get some of your questions answered.", "NTA. Your sister is trying to raise you right, kudos to her. And cursing at people doesn't do any good, although I can full well understand why you felt like it.", "NTA plus your sister sounds like a saint. Thank god for her.", "NTA - this is the kind of situation where I say you can swear at your dad all you want, he relinquished his right to any parental respect.", "NTA.  I doubt your sister is truly mad at you, she is more likely just trying to do the right thing.  You are a teenager facing very adult problems and it sounds like you have an awesome (but stressed) sister.  Talk with her, get her advice, and best of luck navigating this shit, it shouldn't be happening to you or your siblings.", "NTA - I'm so sorry for all that you've had to go through and for having to deal with any of this now. Your \"father\" abandoned you and you have every right to be angry and a single curse word is you going easy on him. All I can really suggest is talking to your sister about it. I'm sure that she understands how you feel and if she doesn't, explain it to her.\n\nAlso just to have this said, if you don't want to see your \"father\" again then that is all right. You owe him nothing", "NTA, your reaction was very much justified, he deserves nothing from you or your siblings, and you're not a bad person for calling him out on his bullshit. He doesn't get to abandon you, and then come back whenever it's convenient for him, honestly just saying fuck off was too good for him.\n\nETA: You should still apologise to your sister though for arguing with her, even if what you did was justified, she's an absolute saint compared to your poor excuse for a father and that's not a relationship you'd want to ruin.", "NTA. Reading between the lines, I think your sister is trying to build a relationship with your dad, probably because she needs more money or for him to look after you occasionally. She must be absolutely exhausted and has no one else to help her out. She probably hates him too, but she isn't in a position to slam the door in his face.\n\nExplain to her how you feel and that it will take a long time for you to build your own relationship with him. Ask if there's anything you and your siblings can do to lighten the load. Shop for her, or help cook a few nights each week? \n\nIf you do ever manage to speak to your dad, I would tell him that the least he could do is buy your sister a decent pull out bed or sofa bed, so she doesn't have to use the couch.", "Nta for being made at your dad. But it sounds like, at least for now, your sister is your legal guardian and doesn\u2019t want you cursing. She\u2019s probably trying to \u201craise you proper\u201d and doesn\u2019t want you getting in trouble for cursing too much. I know it might seem silly but she\u2019s working really hard to take care of you guys and needs all the help she can get, if that means you don\u2019t curse at your dad that seems pretty simple to me. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s mad at you so much as worried and stressed. But even if she is I know she loves you so much and will get over it soon. Good luck to you guys, I really hope everything starts getting easier soon.", "NTA-  he deserves it.\n\nHowever he might be able to provide some resources and help to your sister. Even short term it could give her a break.\nLet her deal with him.\n\nYour flaky parents have taken away your childhood and it\u2019s not fair, but you need to do everything you can to help your sister.", "NTA.  Overcome by emotion for the moment you forgot your manners.  Considering the entire chain of events, it appears to me that you should forgiven this minor transgression.   In the future, it would be best to try to maintain your composure.   Sister may be a bit mad, but if it were a big deal, she probably would have let you have it already.  It wouldn't hurt if you talked to her about it and assure her of your regret for your behavior.   Be happy.", "NTA. I get why you cursed at your dad but i think she was just dissapointed. I'd simply apologize to your sister and just say it was out of frustration.", "NTA.  Telling your parent to fuck off after they abandoned you is the proper course of action.  Let your sister be mad. Be proud of yourself for that boundary.", "NTA", "NAH except your dad. Wow your sister is an absolute saint, you are so lucky and it sounds like you know it. She's doing an amazing job and sacrificing much of her life for you. You need to respect her. If she tells you not to curse at your dad, you don't curse at your dad. She is clearly an amazing woman and will raise you to be as well. I just don't think you'll go wrong listening to her.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister? NTA. \n\nYour dad? he is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister is trying to keep you polite and be kind, which is awesome.", "NTA but please just walk away and fet your sister in the future,  she needs to get as much support as she can to support you,  you doing that with a dad like yours could cause him to punish your sister by cutting financial help again.  Your sister is bearly an adult and had an instant family pushed onto her that she would gave had a hard fight to get you all back, please listen to her about your dad.", "NAH. She\u2019s just trying to do right by you guys. I moved in with my sis at 13 and she was 22. She was also an abused and neglected child and wasn\u2019t ready to be a mom to a teenager. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s not about whether or not you\u2019re justified or if the person deserves it. It\u2019s about what your response does to you as a person. That\u2019s what she\u2019s worried about. \n\nLife sure ain\u2019t for the faint of heart, is it?", "your sister is doing an amazing job. Im sure there is a reason why your dad did what he did which is no excuse of course. when you are older you will know the full story and decide if you want a relationship", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
