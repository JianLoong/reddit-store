We're 13f, 10m, 8m, 4f, 2f. Our mom went crazy and left us when my youngest sister was a month old. Our dad stuck around for maybe 5 months after that before dropping us off at our half sister's (25f) place for what was supposed to be a couple weeks then changing his number, deleting his email, and putting our house up for sale.\n\nMy sister was a full time college student and was living in a one bedroom apartment. She didn't have the space, time, or money to take care of us so we ended up in foster care until she either got a new apartment and a better job or CPS could track down my dad and get him to take us.\n\nWe were in foster care for 8 months then went back to my sister when she graduated college and got a bigger apartment. She takes really good care of us. We always have food, we have good clothes and my siblings have a lot of toys, and she always makes sure I can participate in every class party or field trip. It's been really rough for my sister though. She sleeps on the couch because she can't cram another bed into our rooms and she works 2 jobs. She's out of the house by 2 every morning, comes back by 8 to make us breakfast and get us to school or daycare, then goes back to work at 1. She says she doesn't get much help from our dad or the state.\n\nHe showed up at our apartment a few days ago. I answered the door, he tried to hug me, I told him to fuck off, then I shut the door in his face.\n\nMy sister came out of the bedroom and asked who it was and when I told her, she gave me $30 and told me to go to our babysitter's apartment and see if she'll let me stay with her for a couple hours. She picked me up from the babysitter's apartment and the only thing she said was \"did you curse at your dad\". I told her what happened and she said that she gets why I'm mad but she said I can't curse at him. I know I shouldn't have but I got into an argument with her because I was really upset and now I'm worried she's mad at me.", "created_utc": 1678207551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11l4c18/aita_for_telling_my_dad_to_fuck_off_when_he/", "score": 761, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you did nothing wrong. Your father is a pile of crap and what he did to you and your elder sister is criminal.\n\nYou're very lucky to have an amazing sister. I am sure is is not mad at you. Just let her know that you know your dad is trash and that you appreciate her so much.", "NTA. Your sister should be mad at your dad, too. All of you have the right to be as mad at him as you want to, that includes cursing - He literally abandoned you. You don't owe him anything.", "NTA. Your sister told you not to curse at him?! What an absolute SAINT of a lady. IMO it is deserved. Your dad sounds like a real piece of work, leaving you all with your sister and then returning for hugs. Absolutely unacceptable.", "NTA, your father can sit and spin considering what he put you kids through.", "NTA \u2014 but neither is your sister for probably just worrying and not wanting you to get in the proverbial line of fire. Your dad is a major AH though and it is astonishing he is able to get away with total abandonment/not paying any support. Sending you/your sister/other siblings much love \u2014 your sister especially sounds like an amazing woman beyond her years. Don\u2019t worry: just talk to her and tell her how you feel when you\u2019re both calm.", "NTA. surprised that's all you did, shows how strong you are.", "NTA. He can fuck right off. You are under no obligation to treat him with deference after he walked away and left you no means of contact, as well as putting you through the foster system. That\u2019s despicable behavior. \n\nGood for you, OP.", "Nope - NTA. Your dad is. I\u2019m sorry you were abandoned by both parents. Your sister is a rock star, who gave up her life plans to raise five siblings.", "NTA \n\nYour dad is the only AH here. \n\nYou\u2019re upset and your sister gets that, but she might just want to protect you from your father and wants to make sure you\u2019re acting appropriately. She\u2019s had to become your parent, so she\u2019s gonna have to call you out if you\u2019re cursing at adults.", "NTA\n\nYour AH sperm donor---I would **NEVER** call that man a father--- deserved **far worse** than being cursed out.  After only 5 months as a single dad, he dumped all of you on your half-sister and vanished entirely.  When all of you needed him most.\n\nEven if he couldn't raise you, at a bare minimum, if he had provided child support, maybe you wouldn't have had to go into the foster care system at all.\n\nIn the meanwhile, your half-sister made **huge** sacrifices in her own life to take care of you.  Instead of starting her own life, now she's a single foster mother.  To five kids.  And will be for **at least** the next 16 years.  Think about that for a minute.  \n\n**Respect is earned, not given.**  Your sperm donor's vanishing entirely permanently deprives him of any right to **any** respect whatsoever.\n\nYour sister is absolutely NTA for her feelings on the matter, either.  She likely has a very strong belief that parents should be respected no matter what.  I personally, completely disagree with her viewpoint.", "damn, you're 13 yo. abandoned by ma; abandoned by pops. rescued by older sister. \n\nbig sis is an angel. \ud83e\uddda\n\nyou're at the cusp of womanhood moving away from childhood; adolescence, a tough stage of life.\n\nI don't think sister is overly upset with you. I think she may be concerned about having some of the resources that she needs to care for you and her other siblings being curtailed. If I read it right pops is giving some financial help, limited as it may be.", "NTA, I would've done the same. I wouldn't forgive or forget", "NTA for what you said to dad. He deserves it. Gentle Y T A for arguing with your sister about it. She's trying as hard as she can. Please don't make it harder for her, and just try to do as she asks.  Talk to her and apologize", "I'm going with NAH (except for your father, obviously).\n\nYou're not an AH for your reaction, many others would have done the same. Your father has let you down massively, and if your sister hadn't stepped up then you and your siblings would probably be separated across several different foster carers. Your anger is completely valid.\n\nBut also your sister isn't an AH either. You're 13, and there will no doubt be discussions between your sister and your father that you aren't privy to. Your sister may fear that your father will cut off what little financial support he's sending. She may worry that he'll take your reaction to mean that you're being raised badly and try to regain custody. Or perhaps he's already said he wants you all back and she knows that he'll be gathering evidence to this end.\n\nI'm sorry that this is putting you in an awkward position. Your sister is also young, and she has taken on a great deal of responsibility in a very short amount of time. She may not be thinking entirely clearly, she may be worried about letting your father back in your lives, or she may be feeling conflicted over rejecting his presence in your lives.\n\nI know this is hard, but try to give her some grace. At 13 you think you know everything (I know I did), but you're still lacking a great deal of the life experience that makes us all mature adults. Apologise to your sister for shouting at her, and explain how you feel. Tell her that you feel a great deal of hurt for the way your father abandoned you and that you're not ready to welcome him back into your life with open arms. Tell her that you appreciate her taking you all in when it's probably the hardest thing she's ever done in her life. Let her know that you can't just go straight back to being your father's daughter when there's so much hurt still inside you.\n\nI'm sure she will understand, I doubt she's his number 1 fan at the moment either. At the very least you can aim to get your feelings out in a constructive way without descending into yelling at her, no matter how satisfying you think it might be at the time.", "NTA. I don't think your sister is mad at you! She's probably disappointed that you cursed your father though. Just be as supportive of your sister as you can.  She loves all of you obviously.", "NTA but your sister is a saint! Despite all that is on your sister's plate, she has a presence of mind to not allow you to do things that may harm your chances for a relationship with your father in the future. Even if you do not want a relationship with him in the future, chances are once you are older you will want t have at least a conversation to get some of your questions answered.", "NTA. Your sister is trying to raise you right, kudos to her. And cursing at people doesn't do any good, although I can full well understand why you felt like it.", "NTA plus your sister sounds like a saint. Thank god for her.", "NTA - this is the kind of situation where I say you can swear at your dad all you want, he relinquished his right to any parental respect.", "NTA.  I doubt your sister is truly mad at you, she is more likely just trying to do the right thing.  You are a teenager facing very adult problems and it sounds like you have an awesome (but stressed) sister.  Talk with her, get her advice, and best of luck navigating this shit, it shouldn't be happening to you or your siblings.", "NTA - I'm so sorry for all that you've had to go through and for having to deal with any of this now. Your \"father\" abandoned you and you have every right to be angry and a single curse word is you going easy on him. All I can really suggest is talking to your sister about it. I'm sure that she understands how you feel and if she doesn't, explain it to her.\n\nAlso just to have this said, if you don't want to see your \"father\" again then that is all right. You owe him nothing", "NTA, your reaction was very much justified, he deserves nothing from you or your siblings, and you're not a bad person for calling him out on his bullshit. He doesn't get to abandon you, and then come back whenever it's convenient for him, honestly just saying fuck off was too good for him.\n\nETA: You should still apologise to your sister though for arguing with her, even if what you did was justified, she's an absolute saint compared to your poor excuse for a father and that's not a relationship you'd want to ruin.", "NTA. Reading between the lines, I think your sister is trying to build a relationship with your dad, probably because she needs more money or for him to look after you occasionally. She must be absolutely exhausted and has no one else to help her out. She probably hates him too, but she isn't in a position to slam the door in his face.\n\nExplain to her how you feel and that it will take a long time for you to build your own relationship with him. Ask if there's anything you and your siblings can do to lighten the load. Shop for her, or help cook a few nights each week? \n\nIf you do ever manage to speak to your dad, I would tell him that the least he could do is buy your sister a decent pull out bed or sofa bed, so she doesn't have to use the couch.", "Nta for being made at your dad. But it sounds like, at least for now, your sister is your legal guardian and doesn\u2019t want you cursing. She\u2019s probably trying to \u201craise you proper\u201d and doesn\u2019t want you getting in trouble for cursing too much. I know it might seem silly but she\u2019s working really hard to take care of you guys and needs all the help she can get, if that means you don\u2019t curse at your dad that seems pretty simple to me. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s mad at you so much as worried and stressed. But even if she is I know she loves you so much and will get over it soon. Good luck to you guys, I really hope everything starts getting easier soon.", "NTA-  he deserves it.\n\nHowever he might be able to provide some resources and help to your sister. Even short term it could give her a break.\nLet her deal with him.\n\nYour flaky parents have taken away your childhood and it\u2019s not fair, but you need to do everything you can to help your sister.", "NTA.  Overcome by emotion for the moment you forgot your manners.  Considering the entire chain of events, it appears to me that you should forgiven this minor transgression.   In the future, it would be best to try to maintain your composure.   Sister may be a bit mad, but if it were a big deal, she probably would have let you have it already.  It wouldn't hurt if you talked to her about it and assure her of your regret for your behavior.   Be happy.", "NTA. I get why you cursed at your dad but i think she was just dissapointed. I'd simply apologize to your sister and just say it was out of frustration.", "NTA.  Telling your parent to fuck off after they abandoned you is the proper course of action.  Let your sister be mad. Be proud of yourself for that boundary.", "NTA", "NAH except your dad. Wow your sister is an absolute saint, you are so lucky and it sounds like you know it. She's doing an amazing job and sacrificing much of her life for you. You need to respect her. If she tells you not to curse at your dad, you don't curse at your dad. She is clearly an amazing woman and will raise you to be as well. I just don't think you'll go wrong listening to her.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister? NTA. \n\nYour dad? he is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister is trying to keep you polite and be kind, which is awesome.", "NTA but please just walk away and fet your sister in the future,  she needs to get as much support as she can to support you,  you doing that with a dad like yours could cause him to punish your sister by cutting financial help again.  Your sister is bearly an adult and had an instant family pushed onto her that she would gave had a hard fight to get you all back, please listen to her about your dad.", "NAH. She\u2019s just trying to do right by you guys. I moved in with my sis at 13 and she was 22. She was also an abused and neglected child and wasn\u2019t ready to be a mom to a teenager. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s not about whether or not you\u2019re justified or if the person deserves it. It\u2019s about what your response does to you as a person. That\u2019s what she\u2019s worried about. \n\nLife sure ain\u2019t for the faint of heart, is it?", "your sister is doing an amazing job. Im sure there is a reason why your dad did what he did which is no excuse of course. when you are older you will know the full story and decide if you want a relationship", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The situation you're in is terrible and your father is an asshole.  Your older sister is a saint, but she's also somehow giving your father's complaint about your behavior more weight than he honestly deserves. I think your sister is trying to help you grow up into an adult that can function and thrive in modern society.  Cursing out other people is one of those things that feels right, but will actually get you in trouble until you are much older... and even then is probably not the right way to go.  Find better language to express your feelings.  I don't think you're an asshole, and I think your father deserves to be told on no uncertain terms what a failure he is as an adult and a parent.  Take care and talk to your sister.  Ask her what you can do to help out.  I'm sorry both you have had to take on adulting so early.", "NTA.  She is probably more mad at the situation.  She probably thinks your cursing at him at your age reflects poorly on her.  Do not worry about it.  When you become an adult, you can curse him all you want publicly.  Until then, let her handle it.", "NTA, why isn't she mad @ him, too", "NTA. At all. What your father did is horrible.\n\nIn some contries, parents who abandoned their kids could be sued or even get into jail that.\n\nIts because they are legally obligated to provide for their underage children until legal age.\n\nI suggest to get a legal advice from the lawyer about if you could get a child support from your father.\n\nIts clear that what your father did can be real abandonment of underage children.", "Nta I would have said that and much more to him because what he did to you was unfair and I'm glad on you seeing how your sister struggles and how he just ran out of your lives like y'all didn't even matter talk to your sister and explain that you're not just mad on your behalf but you're mad on her behalf too because it was also unfair to her and on you and your siblings", "Nah between you and sister. Your dad super sucks. Your sister is just trying to teach you the best ways she knows.", "Your sister sounds pretty amazing. I'm sure she understands where you are coming from. Maybe you can find some time later to have a good talk with her if/when you two can get a minute together when she isn't exhausted and all your siblings aren't around. \n\nI can only guess that while your dad is clearly the AH here, your sister is probably also having a hard time and is hoping to get some more help from your dad. Also, she is probably trying to raise you as a kid who doesn't curse at adults. \n\nYou sound like you are a thoughtful person who notices how much your sister does for you. I'm sure she appreciates that.", "NTA and neither is your sister. Only your sperm donor is. Your sister may not want you to curse at him or anyone in her home which is a responsible ask. She understands clearly how you feel about him and it's not necessary to curse at him should you see him again in order to chew him out.", "NTA. I'm sure your sister isn't mad at you. You're 13, were upset by the situation and vented at the wrong person. We all have done it. Just apologize for taking your frustrations out on her. As far as your dad, can't blame you for telling him to fuck off, and while it may not have been right for you to do, I have a hard time saying your wrong for that.", "NTA. Your sister loves you. Even when she's mad. She wouldn't have given up her entire life for you guys if she didn't. Please remember, she is young too and will make mistakes. She was put in a nearly impossible situation and somehow managed to pull it off. It sounds like she is extremely smart and since your dad hasn't come back again yet, she told him to get lost. She is trying to instill good manners by saying you shouldn't cuss at people no matter what, but like I said, she is young too so she doesn't have a lot of experience in life yet either. I don't think she was trying to say you shouldn't be mad at your dad. I think she was just saying you shouldn't cuss in general. Obviously, your dad told her and was offended by it, which makes me laugh because he more than deserves it. I certainly wouldn't have told you not to cuss at him, but I am older and cuss like a sailor anyway.", "NTA. I get where your sister is coming from as the peacemaker (I play this role a lot too) so allow me to offer you this - \u201cI apologize for cursing at you.

I get why you're mad and you have every right to be and then some. But I can see your sisters side about not wanting you to curse at him either. There may still be legal hoops at play here as things like this vary from place to place. Next time he shows up if your sister is home, basically treat him like a stranger. \"Hold on a moment.\" *Close and lock the door* (so he can't just walk in behind you) and go get your sister and let her know you had him wait outside while you went to get her and that you'll be in your room until he's gone.", "NAH except your dad. I think what your sister was trying to get at wasn\u2019t that you shouldn\u2019t be mad at your dad. You should be and her too. But I think she said you shouldn\u2019t cuss because you\u2019re 13 and it may trigger an insecurity in her that she\u2019s doing something wrong. She\u2019s not but to be thrust into a situation like y\u2019all have been and the fact that she had no choice but to put you into the foster system until she was better equipped to handle all of y\u2019all likely bothers her and has created numerous insecurities on her parenting. All parents have Insecurities, I\u2019m sure your sister\u2019s are compounded by the whole situation. I\u2019d cut her some slack and let her know that you understand her issues with you fighting and cussing but that you let your emotions get the better of you in the heat of the moment.

Maybe if there were any consequences, people would think twice. \n\n>she said that she gets why I'm mad but she said I can't curse at him\n\nWhy? First of all, he tried to touch you. Second of all, really? That's it? No explanation on why he's there. Nothing? I don't think a 13 year old telling her \"father\" that took off and changed his number to f off is bad behavior. I think it's completely reasonable behavior. \n\nYour sister is a saint so I'm not going to call her an AH but I don't get this behavior.

Dad, though\u2026..I can\u2019t say how I really feel about him here.", "> NTA. Your sister should be mad at your dad, too. All of you have the right to be as mad at him as you want to, that includes cursing - He literally abandoned you.

That'd be my guess, anyway?", "She probably IS furious with him. She's just saying that to keep OP on an even keel - manners maketh man, after all - trying to be the adult in the room with this situation. \n\n\"You're not an adult; don't curse at adults,\" is what she's actually saying, not \"Don't be angry at your father.\"\n\nIt's a difficult one. I'd say more NTA than not. As Chris Rock would have said \"You shouldn't have done it, *but I understand.\"*", "Sister is sleep deprived and probably can't afford therapy. Hopefully she'll be able to get it soon.", "She\u2019s also probably trying to be a responsible parent who teaches her siblings good manners. And telling people to F off is poor manners, although in this case very deserved. \n\nI think you have two siblings here who love each other very much and are protective of each other in a bad situation. I think they both are struggling a bit to see each other\u2019s perspective, but their intentions are good. \n\nThis is a great example of a time to hug it out, OP. Tell your sister that you hope you didn\u2019t make things more difficult for her and that you will be more civil with your dad in the future if that helps her get money from him. Tell her that you love her and hate to see how much she is sacrificing because your dad sucks. Tell her how much you appreciate what she is doing for you. I doubt she is mad at you, but even if she is, sharing heartfelt truths like that will melt her anger away.
