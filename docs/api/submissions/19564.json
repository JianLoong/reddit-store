The dinner was mainly to celebrate the great year he and his team had, so he was basically the center of attention.\n\nI purchased a new white dress for the night. When I put it on before we left, my husband told me that the dress was practically see-through and left nothing to the imagination. I looked in the mirror, and he seemed to be exaggerating, so I told him that it wasn't nearly as noticeable as he was making it out to be. You could sort of see the outline of my bra, but everyone wears underwear, and, unless someone was deliberately looking, it wasn't an issue. We went back and forth a bit \u2014 I didn't have any other dresses that fit me, as I recently gained a bit of weight and haven't had a need to dress formal, he said he\u2019d rather me dress more casually than wear that.\n\nAfter a bit of back-and-forth, he gave in and I wore it. We went to the dinner, I got to meet a lot of his co-workers and bosses, it was lovely. \n\nAfterwards, he wanted to make a post on social media about the night, and asked me to choose which pictures to include. I saw the pictures of me, and my jaw dropped \u2014 the flash from the camera, and the lighting in general, made my outfit **way** more revealing than it looked in the mirror at home. You can see every roll, every freckle, it leaves almost nothing to the imagination. I was completely embarrassed, and told my husband not to post them.\n\nHe told me that he has **no** pictures of him without me, so there's not really much he could post from the night. I asked him to photoshop my outfit a bit, to make my dress less revealing, and he said that he doesn't know how to do that. \n\nAfter an argument, I won and he agreed not to make the post, but he said he still wants to send some to his parents directly. And, I'm sorry Reddit, **none** of them look flattering, they make me almost look naked! He said, since his co-workers and bosses saw me like that, he should at least be able to show his parents as well. I feel like, since my husband agreed that the dress was too revealing, he should be understanding that I don\u2019t want him sharing pictures of it with family. His co-workers and bosses are one thing, I never have to see them again. But family is family. \n\nHe thinks that I\u2019m not being fair. In his words, I insisted on wearing the dress, and now I\u2019m preventing his family from seeing pictures because of it. It\u2019s now Sunday morning and he\u2019s still not giving in. I want to just forget about the whole thing and move on, he seems to really want to share pictures of the night. I\u2019m not sure what to do, whether I should give up and tell him to send it anyway to put it behind us, or whether I should stand up for myself.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for asking him not to share pictures of us?", "created_utc": 1686497783, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146wzrc/aita_for_asking_that_my_husband_not_share/", "score": 138, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband decides to wear pants that are so tight and light that you can see his manscaping and whether or not he's been cut. You tell him that those pants leave nothing to the imagination and maybe he should wear different ones, but he insists. You get the pics and your husband's veggie-smuggling operation is on full display and he's very embarrassed and doesn't want you to post or send to anyone. **All** of the pics you have from the night that show your beautiful gown are together with your husband, and **all** include your husband's vacuum-packed kielbasa. These are the only pics you have of your special night...

He warned you it was too revealing and practically see-through. You chose to ignore that and wear it anyways. This was an important event for him and he should be able to share that. Granted you should be able to tell someone not to post photos of you but you did this to yourself. Absolutely the natural consequences when someone warns about something and you choose to ignore it, then learn the hard way they were right. He\u2019s being good by not telling you \u201cI told you so\u201d so I will. He told you so", "YTA. You wanted the dress, and all of a sudden it's too revealing? Stop it.", "There are photoshop subs here that can edit the pics for you. Problem solved.", "YTA - he told you, you ignored him. He has no other pictures of this important event.\nIf you want them Photoshopped to be more flattering, pay a professional to do it and give the resulting pictures to your husband to share!", "YTA.

Just because you have bad lighting at home doesn't mean everywhere is going to have bad lighting. He gave you the option to dress more casually and you didn't.", "YTA\n\nWhat have we learned here?  You need to cut the crap with your husband.  Just from what little you wrote I can see the dynamic in this relationship. He tries to give input and regardless if he is right or wrong, you are the type that chooses the opposite just ....... because.  \n\nHe didnt want to show his parents or post those photos online for the hell of it.  He wanted to show PROOF of what he has been dealing with for years now.  You need to get with the program and work as a partner in your relationship or youre going to lose a decent thing you have in your life.", "You\u2019re asking the wrong question babe.\nYou were the AH for not listening to your husband when he told you in the first place and embarrassing him in front of his boss because YOU couldn\u2019t change into any suitable outfit. Literally it would be better if it wasn\u2019t see through- anything would be better than that.\nYou didn\u2019t listen to your husband and stood your ground and you went out in public like that where people could see you in different lights. You put your husband in the worst position.\nYou could have made a plan and you would have made a plan if you had seen pictures before you went out. You choose to not trust your husband and now have to damage control and are still somehow still annoyed at your husband for being annoyed.\nId be more than annoyed that you have acted selfishly at every turn and have no sense of personal accountability or care for how it affects your husband.\nYou acted like a bad spouse.\nYou owe pretty much everybody who was forced to see through your dress the whole night and honestly I hope your husband leaves you at home at his next event.\nGoing alone would be easier to explain than the spectacle you made because you decided to not trust your husband.\nYta", "I'm just going to join the choir.

Now you are being an asshole again when he wants to share pics from his special night.

You ruined his night and made it all about you.", "YTA\n\nAnd no one is as concerned about the dress as you are.\n\nIf anyone comments on the dress, agree with them and tell them that you plan to have the dress professionally dyed or wear something like skin-tone Spanx under it next time.\n\nETA: In the meantime, play up your husband's accomplishments because that was the entire reason for going.", "He tried to tell you and you refused to listen.  Now you\u2019re mad because he was right, it was his night and he wanted to share it, but there you are again complaining - solid YTA", "YTA and a fool for wearing that dress, insisting on it even though it wasn\u2019t your event and your husband did his damndest to keep you from embarrassing both of you. Do I think he should send the photos? No. But I get why he wants to. See if you can crop yourself out or just scribble black marks over yourself in the photo and you should be the one to explain to the family why he has no normal photos to send.", "YTA. You insist on wearing certain clothes, then ban him from posting pictures because you realised your fuck up?\n\nYou sound a bit narcissistic lol, even when your husband is right.. he\u2019s wrong?", "YTA - this situation was caused by you, so it\u2019s up to you to find a solution. \n\nHire or find someone who can do a light retouch and make your dress more opaque. You should pay for it, as you caused it by ignoring his advice and then decided that you should \u2018win\u2019 the argument that he can\u2019t share them.

If he\u2019s not embarrassed you shouldn\u2019t be either.  Your body is what it is, and it\u2019s yours.  Own it.  If it\u2019s not what you want it to be, use that as motivation to either improve it or shop for clothes that flatter you.   Every body is beautiful.", "YTA. He told you it was revealing and left little to the imagination. And you wanted to act surprised when you saw the pictures and realized that it did in fact leave little to the imagination. What you should have done was changed into different clothes that did fit you, or worn something something underneath the dress. Ask him to slap an emoji over your part of the pictures and let him post/send to people.", "He's right. \nHe told you. \nYou ignored his warning. \nNow you got what you got. \nSuck it up, buttercup. \n\nAnd if how you look bothers you, do something about it. It's hard work, but your confidence will be worth it. Note: I'm saying this as someone who was very obese and lost 80 pounds.", "YTA - Actions have consequences. So you basically fucked around and found out. Have a talk with him, apologize profusely for not listening and insisting to wear that dress, say next time you\u2019ll listen (AND DO IT!) and then have another conversation about sending the pictures again. Of course you\u2019re embarrassed that his family will see you like that, and yes, you\u2019ll never have to see his coworkers again, but he has to. Every day. And i bet he\u2019ll be known for that night. Don\u2019t you think he isn\u2019t embarrassed? Or more mortified? EVERYONE IN WORK LIFE BASICALLY SAW HIS WIFE NAKED!! Maybe take a second to think about that. To me it sounds just fair to let him send them. Do need to be around his family everyday like he has to with the people at work? There will be jokes behind his back, or people talking about how fuckable you are or not, how he low it is to let his wife wear such a dress for such an event, .. It\u2019s possible that he\u2019ll go through hell. I\u2019d say close your eyes, go through the embarrassment of his family seeing the pictures and focus on supporting your husband. And apologize. Try to make it up.", "YTA, YOU made the problem all on your own, you didnt listen and now youre EMBARRASSED by your own actions, he is not wrong and you are 100% wrong and have to deal with the consequences, grow up a little and next time dont wear a revealing dress if you dont want to be embarrassed by wearing a revealing dress", "There\u2019s quite a bit of DARVO going on here. Do you realise you are bordering on emotionally abusing your husband. There\u2019s a lot of mention about you \u201cwinning\u201d - well what you actually won was a big fat, unanimous YTA from Reddit", "I mean, overall YTA for not taking his advice and putting him in this position where he can\u2019t share the pictures as a result. Solution is that you learn a little photoshop or approach a friend who can do it, or that you crop yourself out of the pictures somehow", "Actually \u2014 OP how about you just change the lighting settings a little bit? Play around with the exposure, the contrast, white balance, saturation, filters,  etc. This doesn\u2019t require photoshop and can be done on a phone, and maybe you can do a little damage control", "YTA: Should of listened at least go to another room with a brighter light. Now his entire company knows what you look like, pretty much naked.", "YTA.  He told you that the dress was revealing, you blew him off.  In his words?  No, you did insist on wearing the dress.  And now you don't like the pictures?  Yeeeaaahhhh....", "YTA. He told you not to wear it because it was too revealing and you didn\u2019t want to listen.", "OP, you made this mess after he tried to warn you. That means if you want the image photoshopped, you need to handle it yourself so your husband can send the photoshopped image to his parents or post it as he wishes. Why? Because it was a dinner celebrating his achievements and it should stay *about him*. You love this man, right? Then meet him halfway. YTA.", "YTA and he told you so.", "OP, you\u2019re exhausting. You\u2019re the type who needs to be right. Now your husband, who this night was about him and not you, isn\u2019t allowed to post pic\u2019s because of your demands. Poor him. YTA", "YTA. So let me get this straight. Your husband told you it was see through, you didn't believe him, and were surprised when it in fact was.\n\nNow you don't want those pics posted to family because in your own words \"his coworkers and bosses are one thing, I never have to see them again\" (he does every single day and knows they basically know what you look like naked all because you didn't listen to his concerns) and \"and family is family\" \n\nYou seem more concerned about how YOU LOOK AND THE ARGUMENT YOU \"WON\" then him getting to share his achievements with HIS family", "YTA\n\nSo, to summarise: you insisted on wearing a dress that was far too revealing even after you were warned, and you did this in front of all of your husband's coworkers and bosses. And then you bullied him into not posting pictures to mark his achievement.\n\nWhy on earth did you do any of this? Was the idea of your husband having a night celebrating him that upsetting to you that you just had to find a way to spoil it? You should be ashamed of yourself. Not only did you humiliate your husband in front of his colleagues, you are now refusing to let him show off pictures of that night to his parents.\n\nThe damage of this may be something he deals with for years in his career. Do you really think his colleagues won't have talked about your inappropriate clothing? Do you think it reflected well or poorly on him? Do you think his parents won't realise that you are the sole reason their son's celebration was spoiled? Do you think he will forget that a night supposed to celebrate him is now irrevocably tainted by your behaviour?\n\nYou need to apologise profusely and stop making everything about you. Pay for someone to photoshop the pictures out of your personal finances, so that at the very least, your husband can salvage something from the night you destroyed. And try to find a way to make it up to him. Because the entire situation is your solely *your* fault.", "YTA you created this problem by refusing to listen and now you're suffering the consequences. I feel your pain but his hands are tied because you are in all the pictures. Is he supposed to ignore this event when he tried to tell you. At least he's keeping them off social media. Next time you'll know to take separate pictures.\n\nI'd reach out to other people though to see if they have better photoshop skills or ask him to crop you out entirely.", " YTA You fought for that dress and won. This is what you won. You may never have to see his coworkers again, but he will. If you want the pictures photoshopped then you need to do it yourself.", "YTA. Way to find a way to make his big celebration all about you. If you play stupid games, you\u2019ll eventually win stupid prizes.\n\nBut hey, \u201ceveryone wears underwear\u201d, right?", "Go on fiverr and pay someone a few bucks to photoshop the photos so your dress isn\u2019t see through, then let your husband share them.", "Oh please.

He said, since his co-workers and bosses saw me like that, he should at least be able to show his parents as well. I feel like, since my husband agreed that the dress was too revealing, he should be understanding that I don\u2019t want him sharing pictures of it with family. His co-workers and bosses are one thing, I never have to see them again. But family is family. \n\nHe thinks that I\u2019m not being fair. In his words, I insisted on wearing the dress, and now I\u2019m preventing his family from seeing pictures because of it. It\u2019s now Sunday morning and he\u2019s still not giving in. I want to just forget about the whole thing and move on, he seems to really want to share pictures of the night. I\u2019m not sure what to do, whether I should give up and tell him to send it anyway to put it behind us, or whether I should stand up for myself.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for asking him not to share pictures of us?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I never tell my partner what not to wear, so you best believe if we ever argued like you say you did over it, it would be because I thought my partner was making a HORRIFIC mistake.

If neither of you knows how to use photoshop I'm sure there's a million ways to find a person than can fix the dress thing.\n\nIt's giving me punishment vibes: since you didn't change the dress, now you have to deal with the shame of him showing those bad photos. That's not something you do to someone you care about.", "NTA: Your husband is trying to punish and embarrass you for not doing as he wished, and is being petty and vindictive. If he's this way about a dress, maybe he doesn't deserve to see you without one. I hear the couch is nice this time of year.", "Maybe it's because I don't work in an industry where social media is part of the work culture, so I can't fathom feeling compelled to post about a work event on my socials, but I don't see you as TA here. I don't think anyone is TA here really. I think you have every right to your online image and to be able to say, \"I don't want this picture of me online.\" I get that your husband is upset he can't post a picture from the night, but I think he should care more about not posting images of you that you don't want online.  From my perspective, the whole pre-night dress conversation is irrelevant and ultimately a should've, could've, would've scenario. One could easily say that he should have taken a solo picture specifically for social media. \n\nAs someone who has dabbled in photography, you can't always tell how something is going to look under different lighting and I've absolutely been in a situation where an outfit looks see-through in harsher lighting than my home lighting. Like that's all water under the bridge, imo. Even if the dress wasn't the issue, even if it was another reason you didn't want the picture posted, that is your call to make about your own image. \n\nHaving taken pictures of people that I have posted to my socials before, I always get the clear from people before I post them. If they say no, even if it's some of my best work, it doesn't get posted. Even if I spent hours getting that shot, it doesn't get posted. Period. They can even revoke their consent later as well, imo. And I've had that happen. It's absolutely frustrating, especially when I love the photo, but it'd be even worse to post a picture of someone to a social media account without their consent. \n\nSo, NTA.", "NTA. Can\u2019t your husband crop you out of a few?  It seems odd that he\u2019s so intent on sending out photos that make you uncomfortable. Have you asked him why he feels so strongly about it?  Like maybe he has the \u201cright\u201d but I\u2019d like to think your comfort matters.\n\n\nEdit:  ooooh. I came back several hours later to a zillion down votes and realized what I missed in my fast first reading (scrolling Reddit while breastfeeding\u2026):  that this was an event to celebrate the husband, not some random night out.

NTA for asking him not to share the pictures. Since that's the question you asked, that's the question I'm judging.\n\nHowever, I've two additional thoughts.\n\nSince you're not happy with the look, you might think about getting some training in how to dress for special occasions - a good seamstress or consultant would have been able to guide you a look that both flattered your figure and was formal, without being so sheer as to embarrass you. And yeah, white becoming darn-near transparent under flash is not a new thing. \n\nThe other thought is that you felt you looked good to start with. You looked good in that mirror. Take that and own it. Pick a couple of the least revealing photos and let your husband publish those on socials. Should a rude member of your family question the look, you can always choose to say that the dress felt fantastic against your skin! They'll shut up.", "ESH.\n\nYou for being insistent and wrong and not apologising to your husband.\n\nHim for wanting to show the pics given that you\u2019re now embarrassed.", "NTA.\n\n>since his co-workers and bosses saw me like that, he should at least be able to show his parents as well\n\nUm, what?\n\nAlso, this was a company dinner, not a wedding. Why the insistence on sharing the pics? Or is he just trying to make a point because he asked you not to wear the dress and you did anyway?", "NTA. You truly thought you were dressed appropriately and unfortunately, were not. Were I him, I wouldn't be wanting to share the pictures either if they are in fact how you described.", "ESH.  You shouldn't have worn the dress.  He shouldn't post photos you're not comfortable with.  The dress is cursed.  Burn the dress while you and your husband dance naked around the fire.

But he has no right to post those photos in a way that\u2019s visible to anyone without your permission. Just because people AT THE PARTY may have seen through the dress doesn\u2019t mean anyone else does. Period. End of story on that. He can simply crop you out of the pictures or put a big black box over you if he wants himself seen. Otherwise, it sounds like he WANTS people to see his wife embarrassed.", "So, cameras tend to show things differently than the naked eye.  \nIt may have been totally fine to wear the dress in person, but him insisting on posting the pictures of you/sharing them with family despite your protest is a dick move and feels like punishing you for wearing it--which a partner should never fucking do.

That\u2019s not love, that\u2019s \u201ctit-for-that\u201d and it\u2019s cruel.", "NAH, but there's no point in suppressing the pictures.  The best options for this situation are a combination of: a) learning photoshop quickly and/or b) locating and cultivating your sense of gentle humour about the situation.  You goofed.  It's perhaps a bit embarrassing.  But it's not the end of the world. Not by a long shot.", "Right?!? Who can blame him for being a little miffed? I wonder what else OP's dismissing/ignoring/not trusting that her husband says. If my husband told me something was see through, I would believe him. Especially if he was adamant enough to request I even go less formal to an event important to him and his work. This wasn't a date, this was an event with the husband's coworkers and bosses. That alone would have had me changing out of something that obviously made my husband uncomfortable.

That is 100% on her and she needs to come up with a good way to apologize to him deeply for embarrassing him in front of all of his WORK colleagues. Sounds like a major professional event. She should be ashamed of her behavior for ignoring him and not respecting him enough to look in the mirror properly.

Do you ever take responsibility or is it always someone else's fault?", "Do you seriously want us to believe that you wouldn't have been upset and taken offense in the moment if your husband had paused the photographer and said \"hang on, I want some photos without my wife because she's wearing an overly revealing dress and I want some good photos without her inappropriate clothing in it\"?
