She's due at the end of the month and the baby does not have a name yet. She and her husband do not agree on names. They're expecting a girl. So I know from how open my sister has been that she wants Elizabeth, Matilda, Emily, Katherine or Frances for the baby. Other names she has mentioned as being good with too. But her husband does not like those choices and the only name I've heard her mention that he loves is Lake. I'm sure there are other names because she has vaguely mentioned in the last few months all the dumb names he has. Lake is the only one that has been specified.\n\nMy wife's has a more uncommon nature name (Blossom, Lark, Coral and no, not all three, I just don't want to specify which of them it is) and I know my BIL asked her a couple of times if she was ever bullied for her name or whether she ever resented her parents for choosing such a different name for her.\n\nWhen my sister realized a name would not be reached easily she came to our house with BIL one night for dinner and brought up names. Then she started asking my wife questions about when does she go by her middle name, how many people have not believed her when she stated her name, whether she's had trouble being taken seriously at work and then disbelieving her when she said no. But the final straw was when she told my wife to tell BIL that names like hers are dumb and should not be given as first names and suit far better in the middle spot. My wife told her she disagreed and my sister told her just because she was okay with her parents giving her a dumb name didn't mean she should speak for everyone with a dumb name. I told my sister she would not speak to my wife that way and told her and BIL to leave.\n\nShe sent my wife a text later that same night saying she just wanted her to discourage BIL from hating on common names and to discourage him from wanting their kid to have a unique name. My wife showed me and I told my sister to stop bothering my wife and to leave us out of her and her husband's baby naming.\n\nA few days later she came to \"apologize\" and said she was pregnant and emotional and that she was annoyed that my wife wasn't honest. I called her out and said that was not an apology and she used her being pregnant and hormones as an excuse. I told her that was bullshit and she was just going for my wife because she disagreed with her and wasn't willing to do what she wanted. She told me I had no idea what I was talking about because I will never be pregnant.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681112556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hb39a/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_cant_use_her/", "score": 384, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had your wife's back, you told them to leave when it became insufferable, you did not fall for the non-apology (in fact, another slight to your wife), and was not rude back, just told her that any hormones do not justify her being mean. Kudos to you.", "NTA. Yes, emotional vacillation is a thing that\u2019s amplified with the hormones, but it doesn\u2019t give someone who is pregnant carte blanche to treat other people like crap. That is not an apology, and your sister deserved to be chastised for her behavior.", "They sound petty. I'd hate to be that kid, regardless of the name they choose. I bet your wife has a beautiful and unique name, and they're jealous.\n\nNTA", "Hey EMILY is a nice name! Why would her husband disagree!? \ud83d\ude21 /s", "NTA. I could understand her having the first outburst MAYBE. But the \"apology\" she gave just proved that it wasn't just a \"spur-of-the-moment pregnancy-related meltdown\".  Your wife wasn't being \"honest\"? BS. I feel bad for your wife, your BIL, and her unborn baby if this is how she behaves normally.", "NTA. I think you're completely right about her stepping out of line. Your sister had no reason to direct her grudge against her husbands name choices on your wife, and you had every reason to expect an apology.\n\nI should mention that hormones are not an excuse. Her choices are very much influenced by it, so I recommend to try to take anything she says with a grain of salt.", "NTA.\n\nIdk what kind of behavior _can_ be excused by pregnancy hormones, but if you come over to apologize and then instead give an excuse and call the person you're apologizing to a liar, then yeah... Your sister is an asshole.", "It amazes me the stupid shit couples fight over. \n\nNTA your sister is a massive AH. Pregnancy is not an excuse for shit behavior, her hormones didn't just melt her brain, she knows her behavior is wrong but is too arrongant, rude, and emotionally abusive to take accountability. She didnt create this baby by herself she doesnt get to unilaterally decide the name. Its ok to have a disagreement with your spouse or family, it is NOT okay to be rude and act trashy because people dont share your experience.\n\nKudos to you for defending your wife. I have a friend who repeatedly tells his family \"My wife is my home and my heart, you insult her, you insult me and I will not stand for being insulted\".", "NTA. How this escalated may very well have been related to her pregnancy, but her apology was still insulting. She still called your wife a liar to justify her actions, as if someone liking their own name is a scientific impossibility just because she doesn't care for it. It's also not fair of sis to put her between her and her husband in an argument like that.", "Info: Does your sister and BIL have kids? Cause I read another story where this girl was having trouble with her stepmother asking her for names for the new baby and it fell along the same lines. Stepmom wants a typical name, while the OOP and their brother had and like nature themed names. \n\nThe names Elizabeth, I think Emily or Emma, and Lark were all mentioned.", "From everything that\u2019s been described here, it sounds like your sister\u2019s the kind of person who acts like an AH even when she doesn\u2019t have pregnancy hormones as a convenient excuse. NTA.", "How to get your children bullied in school world record any% glitchless.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nLook I think it\u2019s a healthy urge to protect our potential children against harassment by giving them \u201coverly unique\u201d names, and if you know someone with that kind of name asking them I\u2019d they resent it/have been harassed is a totally logical move.\n\nBut what\u2019s not cool is to then HARASS that person and be rude to them because they didn\u2019t give you the answer you want (ie that they resent their name). Your sister came into that conversation with her mind already made up, and very clearly wasn\u2019t actually interested in your wife\u2019s input unless it could be used to further the names she wants.\n\nHonestly I do feel for your sister a little bit: the name thing is a huge stressor between couples and she\u2019s in the \u201cok this is truly miserable please come soon baby\u201d stage of pregnancy, but I totally agree with you. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok for her to be rude to your wife about her name because of it, and then basically infantilize your wife\u2019s agency in LIKING HER OWN NAME by backhandedly \u201capologizing even though your wife was lying (about liking said name).\u201d Again: she didn\u2019t actually value your wife\u2019s opinion, she just wanted her to be an echo chamber for her own position.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
