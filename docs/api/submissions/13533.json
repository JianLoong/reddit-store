Me (23M), 3 others I am good friends with (mid 20s), and a new person Jess (20F). Jess moved in while I was out of town for 2 weeks so we didn't meet for a while after she got here. During my abscence I started getting texts from the other roomates warning me that she seemed hostile towards me, making assumptions that I was inconsidorate and bad-mothing me before we ever met.\n\nI love to cook. I was taught by my dad who is a chef and lived for a few years in india, so I grew up on a lot of (authentic) indian dishes and make them frequently.  I do the bulk of the cooking in the house and often feed everyone. Apparently, straight away after seeing my ingredients she began making comments about how weird they are, how it's rude they all have to deal with my smelly food (they all love the smell, but I always make sure the kitchen is well ventilated so smells don't linger) and how she wont eat anything I make because she eats 'normal' things. Apparently bringing it up unprompted enough the others found it odd.\n\nWhen she finally met me Jess appeared a bit suprised, and said I 'wasnt what she was expecting'. Her attutude towards me seemed to mellow considerably and we have been friendly enough for the last few weeks.\n\n Today it blew up. I cooked dhansak for everyone, and when my roomate invited Jess to join us she refused because it 'looked like sick'. We said she was being rude and she began complaining about how she found the smell offputting. \nI pointed out she cooks a lot of things I hate the smell of (like eggs and fish) without even opening windows and that I just go elsewhere in the building so it doesn't bother me, so she can do that too because we shouldn't have to stop eating what we like because of her. She insisted it wasn't the same but couldn't explain why.\n\nI told Jess I knew she was hostile to me about it before she'd ever smelt my cooking, and given she doesn't mind smelly western foods it seems like she just hates it because its foreign. Jess got very angry at me for \"pulling the race card\" (??) and said I'm making out shes being racist to me, and \"I'm not racist because you're white\"\n\nWe are all torn. I think while shes not being racist to me she still seems generally a bit racist, but maybe its not my place to say. Two think its hilarious, and the other is convinced Jess hated me from the start because she assumed I was indian.  Jess has stormed off to god knows where.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: roomate complained about me cooking indian food before ever meeting me or smelling it. She makes lots of smelly western food.

Avoiding a restaurant or taking orders from a restaurant is a perfectly reasonable action in your situation. I think the difference in this situation that makes the OP NTA and the roommate a huge one is the fact that the roommate chose to badmouth and act hostile towards OP on the sole basis of assuming she was Indian prior to meeting her. Acting on a food preference in this case would have been to express to the other roommates or OP that she was put off by Indian spices, and asking to be warned before it was being cooked so she could isolate herself or leave the house and please make sure there\u2019s ventilation. Racism is to treat the person like shit before any cooking was done, purely on assumption of their race, and then act relieved that they\u2019re not living with an Indian when they find out they were wrong.
