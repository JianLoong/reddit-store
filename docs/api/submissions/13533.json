Avoiding a restaurant or taking orders from a restaurant is a perfectly reasonable action in your situation. I think the difference in this situation that makes the OP NTA and the roommate a huge one is the fact that the roommate chose to badmouth and act hostile towards OP on the sole basis of assuming she was Indian prior to meeting her.
