Me (23M), 3 others I am good friends with (mid 20s), and a new person Jess (20F). Jess moved in while I was out of town for 2 weeks so we didn't meet for a while after she got here. During my abscence I started getting texts from the other roomates warning me that she seemed hostile towards me, making assumptions that I was inconsidorate and bad-mothing me before we ever met.\n\nI love to cook. I was taught by my dad who is a chef and lived for a few years in india, so I grew up on a lot of (authentic) indian dishes and make them frequently.  I do the bulk of the cooking in the house and often feed everyone. Apparently, straight away after seeing my ingredients she began making comments about how weird they are, how it's rude they all have to deal with my smelly food (they all love the smell, but I always make sure the kitchen is well ventilated so smells don't linger) and how she wont eat anything I make because she eats 'normal' things. Apparently bringing it up unprompted enough the others found it odd.\n\nWhen she finally met me Jess appeared a bit suprised, and said I 'wasnt what she was expecting'. Her attutude towards me seemed to mellow considerably and we have been friendly enough for the last few weeks.\n\n Today it blew up. I cooked dhansak for everyone, and when my roomate invited Jess to join us she refused because it 'looked like sick'. We said she was being rude and she began complaining about how she found the smell offputting. \nI pointed out she cooks a lot of things I hate the smell of (like eggs and fish) without even opening windows and that I just go elsewhere in the building so it doesn't bother me, so she can do that too because we shouldn't have to stop eating what we like because of her. She insisted it wasn't the same but couldn't explain why.\n\nI told Jess I knew she was hostile to me about it before she'd ever smelt my cooking, and given she doesn't mind smelly western foods it seems like she just hates it because its foreign. Jess got very angry at me for \"pulling the race card\" (??) and said I'm making out shes being racist to me, and \"I'm not racist because you're white\"\n\nWe are all torn. I think while shes not being racist to me she still seems generally a bit racist, but maybe its not my place to say. Two think its hilarious, and the other is convinced Jess hated me from the start because she assumed I was indian.  Jess has stormed off to god knows where.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: roomate complained about me cooking indian food before ever meeting me or smelling it. She makes lots of smelly western food. We pointed out the double standard seemed because its foreign and now everyone is fighting over if it's racist because we are both white", "created_utc": 1680134796, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1265eby/aita_for_telling_my_roomate_she_was_judgemental/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like y'all both shouldn't be roommates.  Jess shouldn't be xenophobic about Indian food just because she doesn't like it and she just recently moved in.

That's extra.  Time to simmer down.", "NAH, I can't stand the smell of most Indian food. I deliver ubereats sometimes and refuse those restaurants because of the smell in my car. I have nothing against people from India, I just can't smell most of the food because it makes me nauseous. I don't know enough about it to know what specifically I don't like, but when I first started delivering, I didn't refuse orders and my car smelled the rest of the day. Now I say no to all Indian restaurants. I also say no to all pizza orders because they are never ready when they say they will be. I'm sure there are other foods I don't like as well but can't think of right now. I don't cook hamburger because I can't stand the smell of that either. None of that makes me racist or xenophobic.", "ESH.
