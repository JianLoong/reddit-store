So when they were asked about what they would name their baby, they said that they were planning on naming the baby \u201cAmelia.\u201d  \n\nNow I wasn\u2019t happy about this, but I wanted to give them a chance to explain themselves, so I asked why they would give their baby that name. My brother\u2019s GF said that she has a coworker with that name, and that she *loved* it because of how unique and quirky it was. \n\nThis really upsets me (and her reasoning for giving her that name made me even more angry), because I was hoping to name a future daughter of mine \u201cAmelia\u201d after a late childhood friend who passed away from cancer when we were 12. Her name is extremely important to me because Amelia and I made a promise that if she was going to pass away, I would name my daughter after her so that she can be remembered and would \u201cofficially\u201d be part of my family. \n\nIt\u2019s even worse in my opinion, because this is no secret and my brother *knows* about that promise, and I have talked about it multiple times beforehand. \n\nSo, I voiced my disagreement over the name and told them why I didn\u2019t like for them to give their baby that name, and asked if they was any way that we can pick a different name for their baby. But they told me that I was being entitled about it and said that they weren\u2019t going to change their minds about it because I don\u2019t have the right to \u201cclaim\u201d the name, especially since they were having a daughter first and they don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever have a daughter in the future anyways. \n\nMy brother did try to compromise by stating that he\u2019ll be the one to uphold that promise for me, and that he\u2019ll make sure that Amelia will be properly remembered. But I told him that won\u2019t work, because *I* was the one that Amelia asked to make that promise, and it wasn\u2019t going to be the same since he never made that same promise to her. \n\nHowever, at the end, they insisted on naming their future daughter \u201cAmelia\u201d and I just walked away in anger over the whole thing. \n\nI haven\u2019t talked to them for about a week, and I have been intentionally avoiding them because I really don\u2019t want to deal with them. \n\nBut friends and family are telling me that they are really disappointed in me that I\u2019m acting so childish and to get over myself over a name, and to apologize to my brother and his GF over making a scene about it. \n\nAITA and should I apologize to them?", "created_utc": 1675390971, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s8f00/aita_for_refusing_to_talk_to_my_brother_and_his/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus no-one has the \"rights\" to a name, so if your niece is named Amelia, that's her parent's prerogative to call her that, which also doesn't stop you from calling your potential daughter Amelia. I suggest that you talk to your brother and sister in law calmly and respectfully, stating that having a niece called Amelia won't stop you from honouring your friend when the time comes, and ask that you both come up with middle names that flow with Amelia, like (Amelia-Jayne or Amelia Bess) so that the cousins can be distinguished by family (either by double barrell their first and second names or by using initials like AJ/AJay or AB/Abby).

If Amelia was as nice as stated, I highly doubt that would be what she'd want over something as petty as which person said the promise.

Especially since Amelia is such an important name for me, since my late best friend ask me to make a promise to name my future daughter after her.\n\nETA: Someone pointed out that I spelt \u201cRacheal\u201d in two different ways.

She found this very strange. \n\nAfter she named him Isaiah, I had my daughter. Two years later, I had a son and named him something else but with Isaiah for a middle name. She was *furious*.
