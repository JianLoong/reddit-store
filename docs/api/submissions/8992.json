So when they were asked about what they would name their baby, they said that they were planning on naming the baby \u201cAmelia.\u201d  \n\nNow I wasn\u2019t happy about this, but I wanted to give them a chance to explain themselves, so I asked why they would give their baby that name. My brother\u2019s GF said that she has a coworker with that name, and that she *loved* it because of how unique and quirky it was. \n\nThis really upsets me (and her reasoning for giving her that name made me even more angry), because I was hoping to name a future daughter of mine \u201cAmelia\u201d after a late childhood friend who passed away from cancer when we were 12. Her name is extremely important to me because Amelia and I made a promise that if she was going to pass away, I would name my daughter after her so that she can be remembered and would \u201cofficially\u201d be part of my family. \n\nIt\u2019s even worse in my opinion, because this is no secret and my brother *knows* about that promise, and I have talked about it multiple times beforehand. \n\nSo, I voiced my disagreement over the name and told them why I didn\u2019t like for them to give their baby that name, and asked if they was any way that we can pick a different name for their baby. But they told me that I was being entitled about it and said that they weren\u2019t going to change their minds about it because I don\u2019t have the right to \u201cclaim\u201d the name, especially since they were having a daughter first and they don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever have a daughter in the future anyways. \n\nMy brother did try to compromise by stating that he\u2019ll be the one to uphold that promise for me, and that he\u2019ll make sure that Amelia will be properly remembered. But I told him that won\u2019t work, because *I* was the one that Amelia asked to make that promise, and it wasn\u2019t going to be the same since he never made that same promise to her. \n\nHowever, at the end, they insisted on naming their future daughter \u201cAmelia\u201d and I just walked away in anger over the whole thing. \n\nI haven\u2019t talked to them for about a week, and I have been intentionally avoiding them because I really don\u2019t want to deal with them. \n\nBut friends and family are telling me that they are really disappointed in me that I\u2019m acting so childish and to get over myself over a name, and to apologize to my brother and his GF over making a scene about it. \n\nAITA and should I apologize to them?", "created_utc": 1675390971, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s8f00/aita_for_refusing_to_talk_to_my_brother_and_his/", "score": 665, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus no-one has the \"rights\" to a name, so if your niece is named Amelia, that's her parent's prerogative to call her that, which also doesn't stop you from calling your potential daughter Amelia. I suggest that you talk to your brother and sister in law calmly and respectfully, stating that having a niece called Amelia won't stop you from honouring your friend when the time comes, and ask that you both come up with middle names that flow with Amelia, like (Amelia-Jayne or Amelia Bess) so that the cousins can be distinguished by family (either by double barrell their first and second names or by using initials like AJ/AJay or AB/Abby).

She found this very strange. \n\nAfter she named him Isaiah, I had my daughter. Two years later, I had a son and named him something else but with Isaiah for a middle name. She was *furious*.

But I think perhaps your grief over losing your friend is making this situation cloudy and more emotional for you. And I don\u2019t care that no one \u201cowns\u201d names. It feels like putting an offer on your dream house, telling your sibling about it, and having the sibling sneak in and outbid you for the house. It\u2019s emotional. And names do hold a lot of meaning and ownership in our culture. Why do you think people get so upset when someone uses their \u201cdead\u201d name after they\u2019ve changed it? There is absolutely power and ownership in a name. \n\nThat being said, you may be thinking about this in too narrow a fashion. Take a minute and give yourself some grace. Telling your friend you\u2019d name a child after her gave her something much bigger than just a promise - you gave her peace and comfort when she was facing death at such a young age. You gave her hope. You gave her permission to die peacefully instead of dwelling on the life she wouldn\u2019t get to have. Those gifts of peace weren\u2019t ever contingent upon you actually naming your child Amelia. She felt that comfort even if the situation wasn\u2019t real yet. That comfort was real for her. That peace was real. And it won\u2019t suddenly go away retroactively if you don\u2019t use this name, or if your brother also uses it. \n\nThat being said, let me share my story\u2026\n\nYears ago, when I was in my early twenties (prior to marriage or babies), I had my heart dead set on naming a future son my last name (for example, if my maiden name was Susan Smith and married name was Susan Miller, I would have named my hypothetical son Smith Miller). I also had my heart dead set on naming a daughter after my grandmother (Elizabeth). At a holiday get together, my brother\u2019s best friend\u2019s wife and I were casually chatting, and i mentioned the names of my hypothetical future children. Years went by. And lo and behold, this best friend of my brother ends up naming his third child Smith. My last name. The name I had chosen for my future son. They said they named the child after my brother (because Smith was also his last name), but I was absolutely livid. I had this whole vision of what I wanted my future to look like, what I would call my children, and this dream of carrying on and giving honor to my family by naming a son after my family name. I held on to this anger and annoyance for the longest time. I never told them or expressed my feelings to them. But I truly believe these people stole my intended name and let me tell you, it hurt. \n\nWell, not long after that, I ended up getting sick. Like, life changing sick. Seven years of being totally debilitated and told by doctors I would never have children. I prayed and prayed for years for this heartache to be taken away; I prayed that I would be able to let go of this desire for a child. Well, life is unexpected, and after a few miracle surgeries later, I somehow wound up accidentally pregnant. With a girl. And of course I had the name all picked out. But the funny thing was, a few months into the pregnancy, my partner got this feeling that Elizabeth, the name I had my heart set on, wasn\u2019t a good fit for this baby. And after taking some time to center myself and really relax, I realized it wasn\u2019t meant to be her name. A few weeks later, lying in bed, a name suddenly came to me of what my daughter should be called. And the moment I said it, a feeling of utter peace washed over me. It was really strange and unexpected. We ended up choosing Elizabeth for the middle name. And the first name we chose really is perfect for her. After I had my daughter, I couldn\u2019t have any more children. There would be no chance to have a son. And now, I am so, so happy there is a child out there somewhere named Smith. He is carrying on my family name in a way I never would have been able to. I didn\u2019t have the ability in my twenties to gaze into the future and see what an absolute blessing it was for these friends to use the name Smith. What once brought me anger now brings joy. \n\nSo, two lessons: \n1: you just don\u2019t know what life has in store for you. You may not be able to have children. You may end up adopting a child who already has a name. You just don\u2019t know. You can\u2019t. Things happen. Car accidents. Cancer. Or, you may end up popping out ten sons in a row and then you\u2019ll have to decide if it\u2019s really worth naming the last one \u201cAmelia\u201d or fulfill this childhood promise. \n2. Babies don\u2019t generally fulfill your visions of who they will be. They may have health issues you never saw coming. A name may not feel right to you. The first time you hold them, you may look down and realize the name doesn\u2019t fit. And that\u2019s okay. Amelia may grow up and realize she is actually an \u201cEmilio.\u201d And that\u2019s okay, too. \n\nPlease take some time to think about what\u2019s more important to you: using your energy to be angry at this innocent new life and your brother, or using this energy to celebrate this new niece and to give her all the love you can as her aunt. And believe me, your anger with your brother will negatively affect the relationship you have with this baby.  I\u2019m telling you, if your childhood friend Amelia was looking down from the afterlife at you being a royal stinker to your brother and a child who had HER name, she would probably be angry with you. You have a chance to have a special bond with this child because of this name that is so precious to you. Someday, you can tell her how special she is, and how there was another Amelia in your childhood that was strong and wonderful, so you know she will be as well. It\u2019s a choice.

What\u2019s culturally acceptable changes over time.", "Why can\u2019t both babies be named Amelia", "I\u2019m going with ESH. \nYou can\u2019t gatekeeper a name and your brother sucks for using it fully knowing the history behind it for you.\nGive yourself time to cool down, but in an appropriate conversation make it clear that you do still intend to use the name when the time comes. If they\u2019re not ok with two (and as the GF liked the name for being \u201cunique and quirky\u201d, she may not be). But if they are ok with it, you should learn to be as well. Did Amelia have a middle name? If so, name your daughter her entire name. Unless if your brother and his GF are a-holes, you\u2019ll likely choose different middle names.", "Kind of shitty of your friend to ask you to name your child after her.. Isn't that usually something you'd offer to her rather than be asked? I mean, talk about pressure.", "For real! She shouldn\u2019t even have to get into where cousin\u2019s name comes from, that\u2019s someone else\u2019s business. But everyone knows OP wants to honor a friend and they shouldn\u2019t expect her to keep quiet about that part. If bro and wifey really want to set their daughter up to run home one day all \u201cam I named after Aunt Opie\u2019s friend like cousin Amy?\u201d \u201cno Mimi, we named you after the regional manager with the most unique, quirkiest name\u201d that\u2019s their own problem.", "You are seriously overthinking is.\n\nYTA", "You're so full of anger and hate that I feel sorry for you. More so for your niece. There's nothing wrong with naming someone after a co-worker. Even fictional characters in today's time. There's nothing wrong with telling your niece how you used to have a best friend by the same name.\n\nThe name is unique and quirky for my region (Southern US). Haven't heard that name in years if at all. It's a beautiful name and you're *ugly* attitude of ownership for it is completely inappropriate. You can always name a future baby girl this. But how you handled this, your attitude, and complete lack of grace is exhausting. You do owe them an apology and to let this go.", ">\tMy future daughter, if and when I do get one, will be named after my late childhood best friend Amelia, because that is the true meaning behind her name.\n\nNobody besides you cares about that. Why don\u2019t you just name her Amelia and leave everybody else - including your daughter - out of it. I\u2019m sure you hypothetical daughter would appreciate it much more if you choose a name for her that you like and you think she would like instead of honoring some person that means absolutely nothing to her.\n\nYTA and stop with the me, me, ME!", "Seriously. My uncle\u2019s a jackass and my male cousin was born two days before my older sister, but in the days before it was common to find out the gender before birth (ahh, the 80s). They named him my parent\u2019s chosen \u201cboy\u201d name, \u201cJoseph,\u201d after his favorite uncle. My mom started panicking and said \u201cWhat\u2019re we going to do if it\u2019s a boy?!\u201d but my dad just shrugged and said, \u201cThen there\u2019ll be two.\u201d And literally if either my younger sister or I were a boy I can guarantee you, we would have also be named \u201cJoseph.\u201d \n\nPeople need to relax and stop sweating the small stuff. There\u2019s room on Earth for more than one Amelia.", "I can't imagine having a twin, see them go through this kind of grief at the age of 12, and then decide it's not that big of deal. I think he just sucks generally for dismissing her feelings when he was there to witness what motivates them.", "> In any event, if there's one thing I've learned from this sub, it's never, ever, EVER tell anyone what you are planning on naming your child until after the birth certificate is signed.\n\nNot even the other parent? :p", "This, looks like the family is getting two Amelia's.", "One of my cousins married a woman with the same name as my mother. Threw me at first to have two in the family, lol.", "You are by far one of the biggest AH's I've read about.  You did say 'future baby'.  You're not even pregnant and you are pissing a bitch because someone else wants to use the name of your hypothetical future daughter.  GTFOH.  Hope you have all boys.   This whole post is a big, childish disappointment. Stop acting like a three-year-old and start behaving like an adult.", "Also, what if the other parent, assuming there is one, doesn't like that name? Maybe they were bullied by someone named Amelia and that name reminded them of it.", "I'd do it as a first name and see how they like their name being taken.", "I also think the GF is TA simply for thinking that a name as normal as AMELIA is \"unique\" or \"quirky\"...that's like thinking Emily or Alice is a ground-breaking new revolution in names", "Except brother did choose the name AFTER knowing the story.", "Was the mother who picked the name aware of sisters preference for her non-existent baby from her non-existent partner? Why does sisters preference matter at all compared to the mothers???", "I like your trouble-making ways. \ud83d\ude08", "I assume they've discussed the name and the brother knew for sure that OP would have opinions on this. Whether he told his GF before I don't know. I don't believe in gatekeeping names but since the GFs choice is because how unique and quirky the name is I could see a future where she would get mad if OP also names any future daughter Amelia. But with the info that is written the GF should not be included in my E S H statement.", "My grandmother (Margaret Mary, of Irish descent) met her best friend (Mary Margaret) at Catholic elementary school in... somewhere around 1935. She said that most of the girls in her class had the first name Mary.", "I laughed so loudly at this,", "I think that's exactly it. You nailed it.", "He didn't need to compromise. The reasoning as to why they picked the name had absolutely nothing to do with her OR her promise they just happened to also want that name. If they picked the name because he remembered her friend having that name and liked it that would be one thing. They picked it because of his partner. Pure coincidence and OP is making it about her", "My friend did that - her inlaws had already named their son Jack because they liked the name and it was trendy at the time. My friend was brought up by her grandfather Jack and basically said screw it, my kid is Jack because I have always intended to name my son after my surrogate father. It was really NBD in the family (except maybe for the SIL) because they respected her need to honor her grandfather.", "Yeah if her first response was \"hey I am going to use that name if I have a kid so you need to decide if you are OK with our kids having the same name\" I would be more down with OP.", "This was exactly my thinking. Nice job!", "I am more amused someone who thinks Amelia is unique and quirky has enough life experience to parent.", "Absolutely!  I have a cousin with the same name.  They are \"Big Jellissimo\" (because they are older) and I'm \"Little Jellissimo\".  No problems or strange competition or arguing between my parents and theirs.", "Yeah that detail made me raise my eyebrows about the gf's true motivations."]}
