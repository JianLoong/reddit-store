All they were doing was talking about the baby. I explained to my son that hitting isn\u2019t okay and I made him apologize, but I told my sister that isolating my son as punishment is unacceptable.

What did you want her to do about it? Not have children because your child needs to be the only one with attention and love from everyone?

He is the one that kept hitting a pregnant woman in the belly. He said he  did it because they kept talking about the baby instead of focusing all their attention on him.

I tried talking to my sister about it after she found out she was pregnant, but she\u2019s very dismissive. \n\nWhat did you expect from your sister? Because she can't do anything to change this situation and you seem to be unhappy because of pregnancy. And sister is right - your son has to \"get over it\". If there is no way to control his behavior, they won't take care of him anymore. Their child is and will be number one priority. They won't risk their safety. Your method works \"after the fact\", like action-reaction, but it doesn't change his attitude. This would be acceptable for minor stuff, but what if he hurts a baby? You cant say \"well, I will talk to him when it happens\". You must prevent it.", "YTA. You already knew your son was struggling with your sister\u2019s pregnancy. You should have found other care for him.", "YTA.  I hate parents who use their child's disabilities to not properly punish or discipline them.

He learned from an early age to play her like a fiddle. You hit. You get timeout.", "YTA Your son was hitting your sister. Autism or not, you cross the line when you hit people. Perhaps it's best for everyone concerned if you don't leave your son with anyone. If he'd hit your sister, he may hit the baby or someone else out of frustration. And you need to consider other strategies to address his behaviour because your's is not working.\n\nYou may find him socially isolated if he thinks it okay to hit without consequences.", "YTA. Come on. Your son punched a pregnant woman's belly.\n\nYou're missing the forest for the trees by making this about timeouts. Especially when it seems your sister has been an excellent support to you and your child. Do you think she was putting him in timeout to hurt him? Of course not. She's worried about her own child. Give her the same empathy you have for yourself.\n\nIt would be much more productive to start a dialogue about her and your concerns and what to do in the future if this happens again. Imagine the situation from your sister's perspective. You're essentially telling her \"don't worry, it won't happen again since I spoke with him. Oh, but also if it does happen again tough shit, you can't do anything different.\" Reach out, *profusely* apologize for not taking her seriously, and if she decides she wants to look after your kid again then discuss alternative solutions for when something like this happens again.", "YTA.

You have some apologizing and learning to do.", "YTA you going to be sticking up for him when he causes a miscarriage?", "Soft YTA\n\nI understand it can be difficult for children with autism to accept change, but he is essentially going to have to get over his jealousy about the baby. \n\nHe is clearly old enough to communicate what was going on and why he was behaving the way he was. So he old enough to understand he can\u2019t just hit people, especially babies and pregnant women when he is upset. \n\nYour sister should have called you when this behavior started but you cant be mad at them when they were trying to stop violent behavior. \n\nPlus, time out (at least in my home) was never seclusion. It was where they got sat somewhere I could see them and not allowed to participate/ get up for an appropriate amount of time.", "Yta...\nPerhaps find a support group for parents of neurodivergent children. You will need advice and support from as many people as you can get or you and your son will find yourselves without any support at all, including those who have been providing support up til now, like your sister and her partner.

Did you expect her to get rid of the pregnancy to accommodate him?\n\nOnce your kid (who\u2019s age you conveniently left out) started hitting his aunt on the stomach all bets were off. Honestly you were lucky they just put him in time out. \n\nThe separation is probably your sister protecting herself and her baby. I\u2019m pretty sure even if you apologize (which you should) she\u2019s not going to want to meet up any time soon. Use the time apart to talk to your son about his soon yo born cousin and how there is save and love for everyone.", "YTA \n\nYour kid hit a pregnant woman's belly and you're making excuses for it. I notice your post includes everyone's age but his... and I'm guessing the reason for that is that he's old enough to know better, and you're using his autism as a crutch to not discipline him and to let him run wild.\n\nYou're not doing him any favors,  and if I were your sister,  I'd never watch him again for fear he'd hurt the baby \n\n\nApologize to your sister and do better by your kid", "YTA.  How have you not discussed with your sister how to appropriately redirect your son?  She has every right to immediately take steps if he's hitting.  Any caregiver has to be able to provide child-appropriate discipline when necessary.

You didn't say how old he was, but unless he's only 2, it's not too early to start teaching him that no, you don't do that.\n\nI mean, come on.", "YTA. I think you have two choices here: 1.  Apologize to your sister for your son\u2019s behavior and for your reaction. Come up with a plan to keep your sister, her baby, and your son safe when they are together.   2.  Find a new babysitter.   It would probably be best to do both.", "YTA. It\u2019s your responsibility to help your son cope with this new situation.

Your excuses are awful.", "YTA \n\n\"Time out\" does not mean your child was in isolation.

That way he might focus a little on you and not THAT much on your sister.", "You owe your sister and sil a huge apology and until then you won't be hearing from. \n\nHaving autism is not an excuse for punching someone. Your son needs therapy.", "YTA. If you can explain anything to your child, he's not so far on the spectrum that it should be an excuse for hitting someone. So what if he doesn't like isolation?

So you better start dealing with it now.", "That is a REALLY tough call to make.\n\nOn the one hand, as a parent of a neurodiverse kid I understand how challenging it can be. Many of them have to be handled differently; 'standard' parenting can be integral and sometimes even dangerous.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin, I cannot imagine how horrified I would have been if ANYONE had tried to hit my stomach at 7 months pregnant.

That being said, if discussions aren\u2019t working, she can and should resort to other methods of discipline to protect herself and the baby he is intentionally trying to harm to get attention. You either need to accept that they have a need for discipline or not expect them to watch your child who is behaving violently.

Just a thought though: He said they kept talking about the baby, did you ask why they did that, maybe they were preparing him. That would be good, even if it resulted in some overstimulation (though they shouldn't have kept going then). If they continued to talk about they baby knowing he couldn't deal anymore, they are AHs.

If he's able to verbalize why he hit his aunt, he's able to understand consequences.

This requires some discipline, as well as a lot of open communication and therapy. As the parent, you are responsible for making sure those things happen.

Maybe a better way to approach it would have been to brainstorm strategies so she is not getting hurt or in danger, in a way that would work for him to understand.\nHis chronological age is irrelevant, and conventional strategies don't work. So what will?", "DAMN\n\nYTA \n\nHe was hitting her! Getting him away, & making him STAY away from the person he was hitting is the only thing they could do!", "YTA.\n\nI think this can get filed under main character syndrome.", "So you want you sister to educate your son on how to accept his new cousin but you don't think she has the authority to punish him even though you've left him in her care hundreds of times over the past 6 years.\n\nYTA.", "Absolutely.  What scares me is what happens when this baby is no longer protected by a stomach.", "I agree that this is something that can never happen again. I made it very clear to him that hitting anyone is wrong no matter how he feels. He is six, and his autism makes it hard for him to control his temper.", "My exact thoughts. \n\nLike OBVIOUSLY he has to get over it!? \n\nAre you going to hide the child every time he\u2019s around? Give it up for adoption?? Wtf", "Actually I wondered how sister dismissed OP 's worries once she got pregnant. Right then the two of them should have sit the boy down and talk with him.  To address the changes to come and to reassure him that aunty still loved him. Just to say he will get over it is sticking your head into sand. \n\nAnd why didn't aunties call OP to pick up her son after he hit again after the 1st time out? Having her pick him up would have made more sense. Not every  parenting technique works with every child. \n\nIMO both sides failed here. Lots to work on, especially son's behaviour and communication between both sisters.", "I think OP wanted to delegate the conversation to her sister, like **she** should tell her *nephew* what her being pregnant and having a baby means, and not OP, the actual parent.\n\nIt's also been a month, and only *now* OP is maybe wondering if she was an asshole (and if *the internet strangers* told her she's fine, is the implication that OP would proceed to... Continue to ignore her sister and shun her?).", "I guess her sister was supposed to get an abortion so her son wouldn't be upset. /s", "I mean, the aunt could have maybe been present with her nephew instead of constantly talking about the baby?! She could have recognized that this would have been an issue before she decided to be alone with a child that struggles with tendencies. Also, OP could have recognized these things and been more clear. OP could stop saying things like \"oh he doesn't hit unless he's provoked\" as if to excuse the behavior. Should have, could have, would have. They didn't need to be in this shitty situation. The poor kid needs help.", "I get the impression that this kid is way older than I'm imagining from the way OP talks about the kid and conveniently neglects the age of the kid which is the only one that really matters in this scenario.", "He *repeatedly* hit her *seven months* pregnant belly. Bro. Short of locking him somewhere, *what else was she meant to do*?? Literally, **what**??\n\nOh little nephew, no, you can't hit people. Oh, you did it again, you can't hit me. Oh, again, please don't do that.\n\nIf OP is ok with her son hitting her, fine I guess, but I'm sensing that if he's doing this to a pregnant belly... *What the fuck does OP think he'll do to the baby if he has the opportunity?*", "Yep. And OP doesn't even seem to realise that, regardless of an apology, her minimisation of her son's behaviour has just guaranteed that time outs are going to be the least of her problems.\n\nThe sister is never going to babysit OP's kid as long as OP treats their niece/nephew as a barrier to her own child. If she didn't realise her child would be violent to a pregnant person and address it *before* it was an issue, what are the chances that she'll realise that her son is a real and serious threat to the life of a baby and *\"explaining\" isn't enough*.", "Agreed & the best way to prevent it is to remove him from the situation all together; OP needs to find other childcare arrangements until her son can prove he isn't a danger to his aunt & cousin.", "Agreed. Reactive parenting isn't worth shit when OPs son seriously hurts his cousin.", "This is an incredibly thoughtful answer to this OP. You sound like you\u2019re in a tough situation and I hope you get some help, because it sounds like you\u2019re the most responsible caregiver to your younger cousin!", "Or kill her sister by causing a miscarriage?", "Or seriously injures/maims/kills a baby/small child?", "I agree. This is a violent behavior towards OP\u2019s pregnant sister, isolating someone who is being aggressive is a key part of conflict deescalation. This is something that needs to be really addressed before the baby arrives.", "she said in another comment that he\u2019s 6 (old enough in my opinion)", "OP says in a comment he\u2019s 6, absolutely old enough to know hitting isn\u2019t okay.", "Also dangerous? Letting a child repeatedly hit your pregnant stomach because putting him in timeout makes him upset? Too bad.", "She said he was 6", "She said he was 6", "It is not the sisters job to help the child, its the MOTHER'S!! what the heck is wrong with you for saying she is the AH?!? She was being physically assaulted and HER child was being put in danger. So she rightfully prioritized her child. I don't think OP needs to worry about having less help, if I were her sister she would never see me again, considering her attitude.", "So honestly what did you expect your sister to do? Just let him keep on hitting her in her pregnant stomach? \nAnd as AH as this makes me sound you need to speak to your son because at the end of the day he\u2019s not being replaced he was never there child, there child is ofcourse going to be there priority and autism or not you not speaking to your son in a way that he can understand is not helping.", "Children, generally speaking, have minimal emotional regulation; you need to find other care for him since he's a danger to your pregnant sister & her unborn baby.", "He is old enough and aware enough to take out his anger on what pissed him off, the pregnant belly.  If he's having issues controlling  his temper you need to get him some help.", "Lashing out indiscriminately in a temper tantrum is one discussion but the targeting of the baby would be an extremely alarming behavior to me. I agree that you should get your son some professional help. It would be a great tool for you both moving forward. \n\nMaybe a baby doll to practice gentleness with infants will help him to feel more involved and prepare him for this big life change. Also talk to and apologize to your sister/ sister in law. Being concerned with who\u2019s more right than who when you both are working for the same goal isn\u2019t going to help the situation.", "Autism or not he\u2019s old enough to learn that actions have consequences. I doubt seriously talking to him after that fact did any good. Hitting is not acceptable behavior. Even 2 year olds are taught that.", "And being removed from where he could hit a pregnant woman or anyone is the appropriate response. He shouldn't be left to do it because he doesn't like time outs or might get upset. \n\nWhat do you think is going to happen at school? They are going to either do a classroom clear where he will be alone with a staff member or they will remove him from the classroom and yes, isolate him, if he is hitting. Either way he will be isolated if he acts out violently. \n\nYour sister not contacting you is the right call. She doesn't need to reach out and your son can't be around her newborn until this issue is addressed.", "So he can not be in your sister's life any more, because she needs to protect herself and her child.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause YOU FAILED to adress ths issue adequately.", "Excuses, be a parent smh", "He doesn't have to control his temper, he only has to control his hands and learn to keep them off of other people's bodies, or he is going to have a very hard time when he's 18 and you can no longer protect him from the consequences of his own actions. \n\nIt's okay to feel angry; it's not okay to hit.", "Punishment reasoning aside, wouldn't a time out protect your SIL? Enough hits could cause a miscarriage. Your SIL didn't have many options.", "Better advise his occupational therapist that you need to talk with them about effective methods you can use to actually teach your son. What it looks like is you're enabling bad behaviour under the guise of he's autistic and doesn't understand. The point of the therapy is to teach them so they DO understand.", "Time out may not be the most effective method in your home, but he was being physically aggressive in someone else\u2019s home\u2026physically aggressive toward a pregnant woman.  You need to get into therapy quick and get a plan together for serious consequences or you could be dealing with bigger issues or even the legal system down the road.  You don\u2019t get to \u201creason\u201d with someone when they harm someone else.  Your sister is likely doing the best she can under the circumstances and the truth is, in this situation, you should be apologizing profusely to them rather than chastising them for not doing things the way you would.  Your world may revolve around your son, but the rest of the world doesn\u2019t.  If you want to preserve your relationship with your sister for you and your son, better get something figured out quick, because I guarantee you she won\u2019t put her baby at risk nor will she have a chat with your son about things if he hauls off and hits an infant.  I\u2019ve worked with individuals with autism my whole career, so I\u2019m not insensitive to your challenges, but there is no room to tolerate or minimize physical aggression.   Kids grow up and get bigger and stronger.  Being upset is one thing.  Aggression is another.", "You don\u2019t understand! He has autism!!! Nobody else is allowed to do anything ever that might upset him, if he doesn\u2019t want her to have that baby she should\u2019ve begged for his forgiveness and aborted it on the spot because he has autism!! /s", "\"Listen, I know you really want a baby, but my son feels like he's going to be replaced, so do you think you could just...not have a baby?\"", "She said in another reply that he was six. I don't know why she left it out of the post; it's pretty important information.", "Or depending on where they are in the world- face criminal charges for miscarrying", "I saw that. And it bolsters my opinion.  My two-year-old great niece knows not to hit", "The kid is 6. He does need to be physically protected and needs help regulating. He isn't getting it from any of these adults, sadly. Ultimately, the mom is the one most responsible, but it sure sounds like his aunt was poking at him with a stick.", "I am even more concerned about any danger he poses to the baby once it is born.", "Into the cornfield you go !", "That kid can\u2019t be allowed anywhere near the baby"]}
