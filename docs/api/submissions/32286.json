R had always said she never wanted kids. Because of this she struggled getting a boyfriend until around 2 years when she announced to us at Christmas that she got a boyfriend O 40M. O was a nice man and treated her well and was divorced. 4 months into their relationship O proposed to her. To celebrate I told O to bring his family over to have dinner. When O came I didn\u2019t expect him to turn up with this 2 kids J 10F and T 17M. I was surprised since R never mentioned him having any kids. I noticed during the night that J kept away from R and her dad and stuck with her brother. Even during wedding preparations J didn\u2019t want to be involved in the wedding ceremony at all and would rather stay with her mom O\u2019s ex wife (yes his ex wife was there they made a promise to go to each others weddings if they were to remarry to show their kids that they support this). During the wedding J stuck by her mom. Every Sunday we would have a family dinner and I noticed over a while that J had stopped coming . One Sunday I invited T outside to see why his sister wasn\u2019t there. That is when he told me that R was horrible to J and because of this J had been staying with their mom. He said it had been 3 weeks since J last saw her dad. T said that for J\u2019s 12th birthday party (which was the next week) she had lied to her dad and said that her birthday party was just her main family so that R wasn\u2019t going to be there. I told T to text me what happened at the party to see what R would do. The next Wednesday I got a text from T saying that their dad didn\u2019t go to J\u2019s birthday party because R had \u2018slipped\u2019 in the bathroom and broken her wrist and needed to go the emergency room. I felt bad for J. To try make up for it I told T to get J to come to my house on Saturday to celebrate at our house. On Saturday me and my wife and S gave her gifts and my wife made her some of her favourite foods. I even made the effort to keep R away from O so that J could spend time with her dad. When me and R were alone I brought up R\u2019s broken wrist and said how it was convenient how it happened. She snapped at me saying it was an \u2018accident\u2019 and that she completely forgot J\u2019s birthday. Yesterday R came to our house crying saying O kicked her out. When i asked her why she said that he walked in on her and T having an argument on how she treated J and he heard everything she ever did to J and he kicked her out. I told R that it was her own fault that he kicked her out since she stayed with him. She yelled at me calling me a terrible father for not being there for her. I feel bad for her but she brought it on herself so AITA?", "created_utc": 1701639817, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18a48n5/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_its_her_fault/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
