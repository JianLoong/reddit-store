{"id": 17478, "submission_id": "13k56ff", "title": "AITA for marinating chicken overnight", "selftext": "Look, I know the title is vague, but I'm at a loss here. Let's start with some context: I'm renting a room in a 4-bedroom house. Life's difficult right now and this is the best I can afford. The other 3 rooms are occupied by people I didn't know before moving in, each paying their own rent, including a couple that sleeps on the larger room. Since the house is shared, we have free access to the shared spaces, like the kitchen and lounge, and we try to be respectful of each other. One thing that is relevant is that the couple and a person in another room were already friends before moving in, so they spend a lot of time together and do stuff for each-other. All good with me.   \n\n\nFor the actual reason of this post. I'm out most of the day working, and usually when I cook dinner for myself I cook a bit extra to take to work the next day and save some money. The other day I had some chicken breast that cut into bits and seasoned with some lemon, herbs, and left to marinate. Fry that up with some veggies, add some noodles and it's a pretty decent meal. On this particular occasion, my coworkers had planned a team lunch for the next day so there was no point in me cooking that usual extra. Since the marinated chicken was actually smelling pretty good I thought it would taste even better the following day when I'd cook it for dinner again. Got a bowl, placed it all there, covered with cling-film and left it in the refrigerator, in the spot where my refrigerator-stuff usually is ( we do this so everyone knows who owns what in the refrigerator ). Never thought about it again. \n\nThe following day when I get home, a couple of people from the other rooms are kind of waiting for me in the lounge and just start screaming at me. So, the girl from the couple I mentioned earlier is a sleepwalker, and that has never been a major issue until now, save from the occasional noise during the night, but nothing that could be considered annoying. You might see where this is going though. Last night she got up ( still sleeping ), walked to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator and helped herself to a spoonful of marinated chicken. She then proceeded to go back to bed where she eventually felt ill and had to be taken to the hospital.\n\nNow they're acting like it's my fault because since I know she's a sleepwalker I should be more careful with stuff like this and not leave uncooked chicken on the refrigerator like that. I never thought that would be a problem, as I said before we have specific areas for each of us, and we try to be mindful of what we leave there. The chicken was properly covered and it wouldn't be a problem on any other circumstance. I tried to argue this but now they want me to apologise to her and help to pay for the hospital bill which to be honest I really don't feel like I should. Plus I'm down one meal as the rest of the chicken was just thrown out, and I was really looking forward to that.", "created_utc": 1684337706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13k56ff/aita_for_marinating_chicken_overnight/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wow that didn\u2019t go as I expected. She needs help for her sleepwalking. It\u2019s completely normal to marinate raw chicken in the fridge (assuming you\u2019re following food safety and it sounds like you were). It is not normal to eat it while sleepwalking.", "NTA. She took food that didn't belong to her and got sick. That's her own fault. If her sleepwalking is that bad, then she should have a lock on her door or seek help for it. If, as I suspect, that's a bullshit excuse, then she fucked around and found out. Diddums.", "NTA. She knew she is a sleepwalker and she needs to take measures to prevent harm. It isn't your problem.\n\nOh and they should pay for the chicken they threw out. Absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA. Are you not allowed to have any raw meat in the fridge because she might eat it while sleep walking?  Then why can\u2019t you marinate it?  It\u2019s up to her to solve HER problem. I mean, just try putting a lock on the fridge that everyone has a key to and her bf puts theirs under his pillow or something.", "The fridge is PRECISELY the place for uncooked chicken.  Nobody made her eat raw chicken, she did it to herself.  This was not a weapon left out in the open where a child accessed it and hurt someone.  Your friends are really stretching their point so it fits their agenda and have someone to blame.  NTA", "NTA \n\nIt's wild af that anyone thinks this may be on you!", "NTA\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a house rule about uncooked food, so you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA.\n\nIt's her responsibility to get her medical conditions under control so she can exist safely.\n\nIf she had turned on all the faucets and flooded the house would they have blamed the water company? If she got in the car and drove off and ran into a light pole would they have blamed the car manufacturer?\n\nIt sucks that she got sick but it's not your fault. It's perfectly reasonable to store your food in the refrigerator and expect people not to eat raw chicken while they're sleepwalking.", "Lmao, you are not responsible for what somebody does when they are sleepwalking. That is ENTIRELY on them. If they can't be trusted to keep themselves from harm at night they should lock their door.\n\nNTA even a little bit but your roommate is a massive AH for trying to make this your fault.", "NTA. She should have invested in a lock for the fridge if this is a thing, or even better she should lock herself in her room at night. Would it be your fault if she decided to drink bleach in her sleep because you had it in the house?", "NTA.\n\n*\"So, let me see if I understand what you're saying. You got up in the middle of the night, took something from the area of the refrigerator that is designated for my stuff, ate some of it without asking what it was, and are now blaming me for the outcome of your actions. Do I have that right? And to further clarify, if it had been my cooked leftovers, you intended to eat my food without asking or telling me you were doing so? Honestly, I would have hoped for at least a little bit of respect to be asked before you take my stuff.\"*\n\nAt least, that's how I would have replied given the advantage of hindsight. You're not in the wrong here.\n\nSeparately, how in the hell did she actually manage to chew and swallow raw chicken chunks without recognizing it? If she's that far out of it while sleepwalking, they need to be making sure they take additional measures to keep her in her room at night. There's no telling what kind of harm she could do to herself, whether it's eating improper food, to drinking something poisonous, to leaving the rental space and wandering off into danger.", "NTA - You aren't responsible for her sleepwalking.  That's insane.", "NTA\n\nRule of thumb in a shared space - never eat someone else's food \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it is not yours - sleepwalker or not.  Here issue and her challenge, not yours.", "NTA is not your medical problem, so not your problem, also they owe you a chicken.", "NTA. Where else are you supposed to keep raw chicken?\n\nThis is definitely a her problem, not a you problem. You don't owe her shit", "Oh my God. NTA. I understand why she's upset but it's absurd to blame you.", "Wait. You're responsible for the actions of a sleepwalker, but the actual sleepwalker is not? That's nuts.\n\nNTA", "NTA, suggest you guys put a child lock type thing on the fridge and any other possible cupboards that she could get in to whilst sleep walking/sleep consuming?", "NTA they should've put a lock on the fridge if they didn't want her eating random things and knew there was a possibility she would \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Youre not responsible for sleepwalker-proofing your house. It also seems a little weird that she had to go to the hospital that quickly? Salmonella doesn't give you symptoms in the first 5 minutes, and the symptoms are generally not things you would be going to the hospital for immediately unless you are especially vulnerable to severe dehydration. Sounds like  there is some dishonesty happening and your roommates might just want you out.", "Where else would you keep a raw chicken before you cooked it?\n\nReminds me of the guy on Ask A Manager who got written up, because his lunch was too spicy *for the coworker who stole it out of the communal fridge*.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. So what do they expect? That you never leave anything in the fridge that can seem tasty to a sleepwalker? Sound like they need to live alone.", "NTA\n\nThe sleepwalking is her problem, not your problem.", "Nta. Hope you made her replace the lost chicken", "Absolutely NTA at all and she needs to speak to her doctor about her condition as this really isn\u2019t safe for her. She effectively needs to move herself into a baby proofed living environment if her condition can\u2019t be managed, but she is not your dependent and it\u2019s not your place to infantilize her. Should you lock up the Draino too?\n\nThat said, when I\u2019ve had food based disagreements with otherwise decent roommates, I\u2019ve just gotten myself a mini fridge and removed all my personal food from shared spaces. Some conflicts are best resolved by not being available for debate.", "NTA \u2014 how are you supposed to predict that she\u2019s gonna sleepwalk and I eat your raw marinated chicken?!", "NTA. They are absolutely ridiculous. I\u2019d laugh in their face, and refuse to discuss it any further. They know they\u2019re wrong, they\u2019re hoping they can bully you into being the scapegoat.\n\nETA: if anyone is owed money it\u2019s you. They waster you food!", "Not at all where I expected this to go \u2014 I was expecting raw chicken left out on the counter \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\n\nAbsolutely NTA. It's not your job to child-safe the house for your roommate. If she thought it would be a problem, *she* should have hid it deeper in the fridge.", "NTA and how hilarious! Why should you have to be responsible for her sleep eating habits?!", "Nope NTA and if she has a sleepwalking issue she should look to buy a lock for the fridge to stop things like this happening in the future.", "NTA - her sleepwalking is her problem and hers alone.  If your chicken wasn't marinating it would still be raw chicken in the fridge.  What's the difference since both are sealed/covered properly?  Don't pay the bill and let them deal with HER problem.", "NTA-Don't pay anything. Also, was the bowl back in the fridge and covered? Because I know a person who was sleep eating and it was always on the counter half eaten in the kitchen in the morning. If they had kept it, it probably would not have been safe to eat anyway, FYI. If it was back in the fridge, it probably wasn't sleep eating and she assumed it had been cooked and is an idiot that couldn't tell raw chicken so blamed you.", "If this is an issue with her eating while sleep walking, there should be  locks on the refrigerator.\n\nDid you know that she ate when she sleepwalked?  \n\nI would ask them to pay for the ingredients that they threw out.\n\nThis is really a \"her\" problem.\n\nNTA", "You owe her nothing.\n\nNTA\n\nThat being said, I about gagged imagining this happening. *shudder*\n\nNo one was an a*hole until they demanded you pay for part of the hospital bill. That made them the A*holes.", "NTA\nThis isn't your problem at all. I would suggest getting a child proof lock for the fridge since it should be to difficult for her to open when she's sleepwalking. I'd let them know that you'll be investing in an airtight container very soon.  If it were me, I'd let them know that since they didn't inform me that she's known to raid the fridge when she's sleepwalking this isn't my fault and I won't be helping with the bill and I'd ask to be reimbursed for the chicken they tossed out.", "NTA.  Normal people keep uncooked chicken in the fridge.  Do they immediately cook their meat every time they buy it?  Seems weird.", "Lol NTA. That is ridiculous to have held a netting and berate you for something you didn\u2019t do. It\u2019s not your problem she has a sleep walking disorder, it isn\u2019t your problem she ate your raw food. If anything they can pay you back for the wasted food (lol jk don\u2019t do that that\u2019s an AH move.) I hope things settle down but it\u2019s stupid of them to get mad at you and blame you for her hospitalization", "NTA Good old Ambien Shuffle, as a sleepwalker they are just deflecting their own problems, there should be a lock on their door that needs a key on both sides. Pretty stupid blaming you for keeping food in the fridge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
