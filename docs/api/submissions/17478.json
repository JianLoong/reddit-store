{"id": 17478, "submission_id": "13k56ff", "title": "AITA for marinating chicken overnight", "selftext": "Look, I know the title is vague, but I'm at a loss here. Let's start with some context: I'm renting a room in a 4-bedroom house. Life's difficult right now and this is the best I can afford. The other 3 rooms are occupied by people I didn't know before moving in, each paying their own rent, including a couple that sleeps on the larger room. Since the house is shared, we have free access to the shared spaces, like the kitchen and lounge, and we try to be respectful of each other. One thing that is relevant is that the couple and a person in another room were already friends before moving in, so they spend a lot of time together and do stuff for each-other. All good with me.   \n\n\nFor the actual reason of this post. I'm out most of the day working, and usually when I cook dinner for myself I cook a bit extra to take to work the next day and save some money. The other day I had some chicken breast that cut into bits and seasoned with some lemon, herbs, and left to marinate. Fry that up with some veggies, add some noodles and it's a pretty decent meal. On this particular occasion, my coworkers had planned a team lunch for the next day so there was no point in me cooking that usual extra. Since the marinated chicken was actually smelling pretty good I thought it would taste even better the following day when I'd cook it for dinner again. Got a bowl, placed it all there, covered with cling-film and left it in the refrigerator, in the spot where my refrigerator-stuff usually is ( we do this so everyone knows who owns what in the refrigerator ). Never thought about it again. \n\nThe following day when I get home, a couple of people from the other rooms are kind of waiting for me in the lounge and just start screaming at me. So, the girl from the couple I mentioned earlier is a sleepwalker, and that has never been a major issue until now, save from the occasional noise during the night, but nothing that could be considered annoying. You might see where this is going though. Last night she got up ( still sleeping ), walked to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator and helped herself to a spoonful of marinated chicken. She then proceeded to go back to bed where she eventually felt ill and had to be taken to the hospital.\n\nNow they're acting like it's my fault because since I know she's a sleepwalker I should be more careful with stuff like this and not leave uncooked chicken on the refrigerator like that. I never thought that would be a problem, as I said before we have specific areas for each of us, and we try to be mindful of what we leave there. The chicken was properly covered and it wouldn't be a problem on any other circumstance. I tried to argue this but now they want me to apologise to her and help to pay for the hospital bill which to be honest I really don't feel like I should. Plus I'm down one meal as the rest of the chicken was just thrown out, and I was really looking forward to that.", "created_utc": 1684337706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13k56ff/aita_for_marinating_chicken_overnight/", "score": 466, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd let them know that you'll be investing in an airtight container very soon.  If it were me, I'd let them know that since they didn't inform me that she's known to raid the fridge when she's sleepwalking this isn't my fault and I won't be helping with the bill and I'd ask to be reimbursed for the chicken they tossed out.", "NTA.  Normal people keep uncooked chicken in the fridge.  Do they immediately cook their meat every time they buy it?  Seems weird.", "Lol NTA. That is ridiculous to have held a netting and berate you for something you didn\u2019t do.

NTA. She needs to get help with her sleep walking.", "NTA - Sleep walking is not your problem, it is hers and she needs help with it. The chicken marinating wasn't the issue either. The same thing could/would have happened if you left the raw chicken on a plate under plastic wrap. Again, not your fault.", "NTA and also what a fun plot twist.  I was expecting like a \u201cI left chicken marinating on top of the radiator like I always do tuesday morning and when I got home from work Wednesday night my roommates were totally uncool about it I\u2019m at a loss!\u201d or some similar such AITA type of nonsense.", "NTA. She could have just as easily opened a package of raw meat and done the same thing. So\u2026 only things that are edible as-is are allowed in the house, period? Absurd. I\u2019m sorry she got sick but you did nothing wrong.", ">they want me to apologise to her and help to pay for the hospital bill\n\n**Ding ding ding - we have the winner! It's a shakedown for cash.**\n\nMaybe she did sleep walk and eat some of your raw chicken, maybe she didn't. Maybe she did have food poisoning badly enough to become ill, hospitalized and home within 12 or so hours, maybe she didn't. But if this was me there would be no \"maybe\" about whether they are getting any cash from me. It would be a complete sentence of \"nope\".\n\n**NTA**", "no they should replace your chicken. they took your stuff. and if there are no clear house rules communicated that everybody agreed on you just used your place as it's supposed to be used. you're not responsible for her disorder NTA", "NTA\n\nMarinating chicken overnight - up to 24 hours - is common because it imparts flavor and also \"brines\" the chicken making it more tender and juicy.\n\nIt is not your job to ensure that food that belongs to you is safe from thieves. \n\nInquiring minds want to know how she remembered she had a tablespoon of chicken marinade if she was sleep walking? \n\nAlso while chicken is a potential source of food poisoning, it seems highly unlikely that someone would have to be hospitalized for a tablespoon of marinade. \n\nAt any rate, you are certainly not responsible for hospital bills and they should reimburse you for the cost of the chicken they threw out.", "NTA\nI was not expecting this story to go this way.

I woke up one time sitting at my kitchen counter eating a bowl of Cheerios. Apparently when I was a kid I often went to the front door and unlocked it, attempting to go outside(?). So I have very specific bedtime rituals/obstacles in place to prevent me from hurting myself. It's not her fault she sleepwalks but this is...not the way to handle it", "NTA. People often put uncooked food in the refrigerator.", "NTA. Where else are you supposed to put raw meat besides the refrigerator. Your did absolutely nothing wrong, they should apologize to you. No reasonable person would expect raw meat not to be kept in the refrigerator. If they had asked, and if you had agreed, to not to have any raw meat in the fridge they might have a point, although that would be an unreasonable request.", "NTA for the many reasons already listed.\n\nBut OP, please listen to me::: do not agree to pay any of her bill at all. Nothing. Don't agree to buy a lock for the fridge. Stand your ground. You did nothing wrong. Paying even a fraction or investing a trivial amount in a lock could be seen as admitting fault. You did nothing wrong. \n\nIf someone has a serious medical condition, it's their responsibility to figure out how to make their living space safe. She fucking snacks on raw meat?! And she doesn't have a door alarm on the fridge? Her fault. Also, wtf, overall. \n\nBy the way, I might nominate you for NTA of the year, if that's a thing. Great story, mate.", "NTA", "Nta and this is jot your fault. If they keep pressing you and harassing you I would inform the landlord. See if you can move out. This is in no way your fault or financial responsibility for her medical issue, what the actual f.", "She could have just easily grab a knife, fall down the stairs, put a fork in electricity, eat couch cushions or 102 other things that can harm if she wasn't aware. The fact that the dangerous things happens to be yours doesn't matter.

Crazy!", "Your \u201cYTA\u201d judgement doesn\u2019t seem to match the rest of your comment\u2026", "She def stole your food and is just mad she got sick. Tell them to shove it and start looking for new place to live.", "INFO I'm not sure I'm convinced about her story tbh. \nShe felt unwell during the night and immediately went to check if she'd eaten something dodgy whilst sleepwalking?\n\nDid she actually eat and swallow raw chicken? Bc I'm not even sure a small taste of the marinade would have justified a hospital trip.", "Here\u2019s one of my favorite cooking tips for you. Buy a package of disposable shower caps and use them to cover bowls instead of plastic wrap (clingfilm to Brits).\n\nYou can wash the shower cap and reuse it countless times. Less non-biodegradable plastic in the dump.", "Apparently, you should also cover this with multiple layers of duct tape so that any casual sleep walker that happens by will not be able to snack on your (uncooked) food.", "I dont belive she was sick from raw chicken. I did eat some by accident and nothing hapend, if it was many days old yes, but salt, marinade eliminate all bad stuff for one or 2 days, are you sure she didnt eat wrapper? She is stupid.", "She could've drunk the whole bottle of vinegar thinking it was something else too, or eaten some raw eggs, swallowed forks and knives, or else. It does sound bizarre that sleepwalker expects someone else to pay for the accidents caused by her condition, especially when the OP knew nothing about it", "My ex gave himself a nasty burn sleep walking. While sleeping he got up, and started to make a grilled cheese. Only he turned on the gas stove, and then placed a hunk of cheese and bread directly on the open flame with his hand. It was bad, but could have been much worse. \n\nFinally convinced him that he had a serious issue with sleep walking though.", "They can put an alarm on their bedroom door that can alert him. Also I\u2019m calling bs she was so sick she had to go for the hospital but was out before you were back to work", "Tell him to put one of those baby safety door knobs in the inner door knob.", "What poppy cock!   So her sleep walking self knows not to open Tupperware but can't help herself with cling film??", "look it sucks that she sleepwalks but that's something SHE needs to account for. and leaving chicken in the fridge (where it literally goes?) is not leaving it out. \n\nYou did literally nothing wrong.", "Then you wouldn't have known to expect her to pull back the plastic wrap and eat raw chicken in the middle of the night.", "oh she's definitely eaten all yalls food before", "Thank you for pointing that out. A slip of the finger and I have corrected it.", "OP said it was thrown out. Sounds to me like the roommate intentionally ate some of OP's food and then tried to cover it as sleepwalking when they got sick.", "It was thrown out, OP said", "I had a relative who would leave the house at night and walk for miles in his sleep \n\nHe'd also attempt chores like mowing the lawn and when they locked up the mower, he'd push a baby stroller\n\nI would leave my bed and hide all over the house in my sleep", "And I'm not sure, but food poisoning takes some time to actually happen, atleast the times I had it. It wasn't on and over in a short time.", "This happens often and even happened to me.

Even when we all had different ref. Even when I asked him not to take it. (I was a poor student, and we weren't friends). In the end I just had it (I really love milk) and I put laxatives in the milk. I can tell you, the stealing stopped after that. \n\nFYI. I didn't know at the time how dangerous laxatives can be.", "Totally something like this. Are they going to lock up eggs and other products that can be dangerously consumed? For me, the use of a utensil to eat the item is were I really question the story. The kitchen drawers or fridge door would have been left open from my experience", "There's different causes of food poisoning, and yes, most do take longer. The only one I'm aware of that kicks in that quickly is the type from food being left unrefrigerated too long.", "Spiking food with laxatives can be a criminal charge. Making things spicy is totally legal.", "Thanks for the tip!", "Don,t make it stronger than what you can eat", "Can you cite any examples of people being convicted for it? That would be an interesting case.", "Same with EXTRA EXTRA salty.", "i mean it's not his food so its his fault if he eats it.", "it's not a crime if it's your food that other people aren't supposed to take", "Isn't that kind of risky too though? Some  people  have ulcers that spicy food can trigger. Then again they shouldn't be taking other people's food", "Yeah, but there's a difference between something you could reasonably be expected to have in your own food, and something you couldn't.", "Lol let me shed a tear for the thief."]}
