{"id": 17478, "submission_id": "13k56ff", "title": "AITA for marinating chicken overnight", "selftext": "Look, I know the title is vague, but I'm at a loss here. Let's start with some context: I'm renting a room in a 4-bedroom house. Life's difficult right now and this is the best I can afford. The other 3 rooms are occupied by people I didn't know before moving in, each paying their own rent, including a couple that sleeps on the larger room. Since the house is shared, we have free access to the shared spaces, like the kitchen and lounge, and we try to be respectful of each other. One thing that is relevant is that the couple and a person in another room were already friends before moving in, so they spend a lot of time together and do stuff for each-other. All good with me.   \n\n\nFor the actual reason of this post. I'm out most of the day working, and usually when I cook dinner for myself I cook a bit extra to take to work the next day and save some money. The other day I had some chicken breast that cut into bits and seasoned with some lemon, herbs, and left to marinate. Fry that up with some veggies, add some noodles and it's a pretty decent meal. On this particular occasion, my coworkers had planned a team lunch for the next day so there was no point in me cooking that usual extra. Since the marinated chicken was actually smelling pretty good I thought it would taste even better the following day when I'd cook it for dinner again. Got a bowl, placed it all there, covered with cling-film and left it in the refrigerator, in the spot where my refrigerator-stuff usually is ( we do this so everyone knows who owns what in the refrigerator ). Never thought about it again. \n\nThe following day when I get home, a couple of people from the other rooms are kind of waiting for me in the lounge and just start screaming at me. So, the girl from the couple I mentioned earlier is a sleepwalker, and that has never been a major issue until now, save from the occasional noise during the night, but nothing that could be considered annoying. You might see where this is going though. Last night she got up ( still sleeping ), walked to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator and helped herself to a spoonful of marinated chicken. She then proceeded to go back to bed where she eventually felt ill and had to be taken to the hospital.\n\nNow they're acting like it's my fault because since I know she's a sleepwalker I should be more careful with stuff like this and not leave uncooked chicken on the refrigerator like that. I never thought that would be a problem, as I said before we have specific areas for each of us, and we try to be mindful of what we leave there. The chicken was properly covered and it wouldn't be a problem on any other circumstance. I tried to argue this but now they want me to apologise to her and help to pay for the hospital bill which to be honest I really don't feel like I should. Plus I'm down one meal as the rest of the chicken was just thrown out, and I was really looking forward to that.", "created_utc": 1684337706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13k56ff/aita_for_marinating_chicken_overnight/", "score": 2675, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That made them the A*holes.", "NTA\nThis isn't your problem at all. I would suggest getting a child proof lock for the fridge since it should be to difficult for her to open when she's sleepwalking. I'd let them know that you'll be investing in an airtight container very soon.  If it were me, I'd let them know that since they didn't inform me that she's known to raid the fridge when she's sleepwalking this isn't my fault and I won't be helping with the bill and I'd ask to be reimbursed for the chicken they tossed out.", "NTA.  Normal people keep uncooked chicken in the fridge.  Do they immediately cook their meat every time they buy it?  Seems weird.", "Lol NTA. That is ridiculous to have held a netting and berate you for something you didn\u2019t do. It\u2019s not your problem she has a sleep walking disorder, it isn\u2019t your problem she ate your raw food. If anything they can pay you back for the wasted food (lol jk don\u2019t do that that\u2019s an AH move.) I hope things settle down but it\u2019s stupid of them to get mad at you and blame you for her hospitalization", "NTA Good old Ambien Shuffle, as a sleepwalker they are just deflecting their own problems, there should be a lock on their door that needs a key on both sides.
