I spent most days with them as my mother was a young single mother and she worked and went to university. My grandparents always told me that when they pass they will leave their house to me as a kickstart for my young family. \n\nA few years ago my grandparents started getting sick, it started with my grandfather getting dementia. His illness took a great toll on my grandmother who was his primary caregiver. I spent most of my free time visiting them and trying to help them with anything they needed around the house like cooking, cleaning, and some repairs. My grandfather's illness progressed rapidly and eventually he needed constant care. \n\nA few months later my grandmother ended up having a hard time breathing and had to go to the hospital to be checked out. Turns out she had stage 4 lung cancer. Her health deteriorates rapidly and within 2 months she passed away. My mother who has been living on the other side of the country for the last 8 years came home seen her mother for the last week of her life. At the same time my grandfather's family (bothers and sisters) along with myself were taking care of him and arranged for him to go into a nursing home.\n\nMy mom decides shes moving home to see her father more while he is still alive and decides to move her family into my grandparents house. This isn't a problem with me as I have a house I am renting nearby and I would rather them use the house than have it empty. They were also paying the mortgage so it basically saved me from having to find another tenant to cover the costs. \n\nNow a few years have passed, and she bought  a bigger house to suit her family about 20 minutes away. So now we are selling the house and she immediately assumes we are splitting the money 50/50. I asked why she would think that? The house was supposed to be left to me, she knew that was my grandparents wishes. Our whole family including great uncles and aunts knew the house was to be left to me. \n\nThe shitty thing is, my grandparents never left a will, and my mother as next of kin has full control over the estate. She says I should not be greedy and that she could keep the entire amount when the house sells and I should be happy I am getting half. I want to keep the peace with my mother and I don't want to be greedy. But I can't help but feel like I am being  extremely betrayed. Should I just not worry about the >60k to save my relationship with my mother?", "created_utc": 1695166492, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16n5vxs/aita_for_telling_my_mother_she_is_stealing_my/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, you seem to forget that your mother is their child. The situation would be different if she had like no relationship with them or you but it is not the case.\n\n50/50 is actually fair for both of you.

Very unfortunate.", "So sorry to-say that your grandparents should have never promised anything with out a will. Curious - it sounds like you were helping out when their health deteriorated-  no mention of spending quality time before this. Suspicion\u2026..", "YTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t have any inheritance. As they didn\u2019t have a will, this was *always* going to go to your mother. You can do whatever you want, but there is nothing you\u2019ve said here that is cause to think you ever legitimately had inheritance. Even if your mother had no moved, she\u2019s still their child & it would rightfully go to her as they left nothing in writing to prove your claims.

I also want to be clear I haven't actually made a fuss about this issue with my mother. I actually plan on letting this blow over and taking the half of the money and keeping the peace. I just can't help but feel betrayed and wanted to know if I am right to feel resentment.\n\nTrust me, I understand the legal situation. I just can't help but feel my grandparents wishes should be respected regardless if they had a will made up or not. Especially as it was common knowledge and even brought up in my grandmothers final weeks of life. \n\nI know they would have and should have made a will but it's hard to understand how fast their health deteriorated and no one expected my grandmother to be sick and pass away in under two months after being diagnosed. We should have gotten their affairs in order when she was diagnosed but at the time we were focused on being hopful and helpful, we didn't talk about the possibility of her life ending until she was too unwell to do any legal work. Looking back I wish we did but those moments were spent the best way we saw fit at the time and we expected to have many more.", "Honestly - you\u2019re extremely lucky your mom is giving you half.

You don't have an inheritance.", "Another case of AITA commenters throwing out YTA in place of a \"you cant do anything legally.\"\n\nYou're not being an asshole, so NTA. Honestly, NAH. Your grandparents' passing is obviously incredibly devastating for both you and your mother.

I'm sorry your grandparents failed to follow through on their promise to you, but there's nothing you can do about it now.", "NTA. This sub has lots their damn minds. In the last few days I have seen things where that are just wrong. The guy threw away his partners jacket and it was okay. Now this. Legal doesn't mean right.", "NTA and eveyone saying otherwise are just weird assholes themselves. Your Mother really showed who she was when she was comfortable just selling the house that had so many memories in it for a fancier place. the 60k offer is not even a kind gesture, more like a \"shut up and leave\" offer. Your grandparents screwed you legally but your mother has screwed you morally with her actions and honestly idk how I would look at her the same.

This isn't 'am I legally in the right', as is so often pointed out on here. \n\nImagine looking your child in the eye and saying 'sorry, I know granny wanted you to have this but since she didn't get a lawyer to sign off on it, fuck her wishes, it's mine now'???? Parents are supposed to put their kids first, not selfishly hoard everything to themselves! \n\nWhat is wrong with everyone here? \n\nNTA, OP. I'm really sorry that this is happening to you. I would maybe approach them to see how much they paid on the mortgage and see if maybe you can offer to give that to them from the proceeds.", "You need to talk to a lawyer, preferably one who routinely handles estate disputes in the county where the house is located. You might have had a claim against the estate of the last grandparent to die based on a contract or quasi-contraxt theory -- that there was an agreement with your grandparents that your 'payment' for caring for them would be the house. (Or perhaps even with your mother ...). But whether you do or not depends on the law of your jurisdiction and also statutory requirements for asserting such claims within certain time periods as part of administration of a decedent's estate.\n\nIn other words, despite the lack of a will, you MIGHT have a viable claim. But you need a local lawyer to advise you whether you do under the law of your jurisdiction.", "YTA. Sure, you're grandparents said you'd get the house, but you can't forget that your mother is their CHILD.

You were a good grandchild and I wish your grandparents had recognized that by leaving a will.", "YTA.  There is no will, so any words that were said are meaningless now.  If it meant so much to the grandparents that you have the house, then they should have made a will.\n\nSo this is a lesson to everyone - make a will if you want specific things to go to specific people.  Otherwise, you are leaving a giant mess behind - unless that is what you want of course......LOL", "No will, you\u2019re screwed.. money powers", "There is no supposed about it. Everything falls to your mother presuming your grandparents are her parents and not her Inlaws.", "NTA You and everyone in your family knew that the house was supposed to go to you, so you\u2019re not wrong for asking for all the money from the sale. But your grandparents screwed up by not having a will and your mother is taking advantage of that fact. She is a massive AH for that but legally you can\u2019t dispute it.

Unfortunately, your mother is right, without a will, whatever she gives you is what you get.\n\nMake a will people!", "NTA, I\u2019m also very surprised to see every saying you are. If the entire family knew the house was supposed to be yours, that\u2019s the facts.\n\nSadly you got snookered by your own parent and it\u2019s being held over your head. You shouldn\u2019t feel lucky, you indeed should feel entitled.\n\nHowever, only you know if the 60k, 30k after taxes is worth the relationship. \n\nIf it was me, I\u2019d suck it up.

Since they haven't... you get nothing.\n\nStop arguing and if your mother is still willing to give you half... take it.  YTA for assuming you are entitled to anything more.

The will was made, though, so I don't give a shit. It will suck enough losing my parents without having to deal with vultures. I genuinely did not care what they did with their estate as long as they made the decision.\n\nIt blows my mind that people will screw the people they love the most because they can't be bothered to contemplate their own mortality long enough to get a will made.

Look, families tell each other all the time that they are/aren't in the will, for all sorts of reasons - to secure help they otherwise might not get, to reward, to punish, to placate. It isn't right, but it's true. Everything anyone promises you're getting after they die should be taken with a grain of salt. People's real wishes are what they put in a will, and if there is no will, their wish is for it to go to their jurisdiction's default beneficiaries - so, OP's mom.

I don't think I've ever downvoted so many times in a single day before. Mercury must be in Gatorade or whatever.", "Agreed.  This isn't r/legal, where the question would legitimately be whether the OP has recourse.  Yes, the mother CAN keep as much of the money as she wants.  The pertinent question for here is whether she SHOULD.", "This is hardly shocking, it's par for the course for AITA. I'm constantly reading \"no one is entitled to an inheritance\" on here. Idk all possessions going to the next of kin has been a thing for *forever*. The grandparents may have told OP throughout their lives that she'd get the house but I can't imagine they'd be unaware it would automatically go to their daughter with no will in place. And they had plenty of time to make a will in the many years they were telling her that she'd get the house. It's not like we have evidence the mother told them not to make a will and promised them she'd give OP the house.", "Then OP is also an AH according to you because she cared for her gps because they promised her the house. But OP didn't do that at all, she was selfless.", "Agreed on the grandparents being the primary assholes. Because the thing is, if you don't make a will, what you're really saying is that either you agree with the way that the law will divide your estate after you've gone, or that you really don't care enough about the people you wanted to inherit, to ease their way through the situation. And either way, any promises you made that weren't in line with intestacy laws in your part of the world, were completely empty and meaningless.\n\nMaybe OP's grandparents thought they had more time. But they knew they needed help from OP, they promised her an inheritance, and they didn't follow through.", "Thanks, that makes a lot more sense.", "Thank you for almost making me spit my drink out my nose for the \u201cMercury must be in Gatorade\u2026\u201d comment.  If there were still awards and I actually had any money, this would convince me to buy one and give it to you.  As it stands, all I have to offer is the knowledge that this will make me laugh forever, whenever someone makes a comment about Mercury (or whatever).  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "*Mercury must be in Gatorade*\n\nNOBODY PANIC!", "Some people are, unfortunately, naive enough to believe that their next of kin will honour their wishes without being forced to legally. Many also have misinformed ideas about estate taxes and debt; etc. \n\nThe mom\u2019s a huge asshole for doing this. She\u2019s basically screwing over her own kid for money."]}
