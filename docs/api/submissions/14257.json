If she wanted to be more specific than that, she should have said so, or at least made herself available to answer questions like \"Is it okay if I get this?\"\n\nSaying it was her treat, handing him money, walking away, and then giving a surprised Pikachu face that he *~gasp~* spent the money she gave him! ... she's just being stupid.", "Why was Matt in charge of the money? Stacey\u2019s kid was standing there. \n\nIf you give a group of 10 yr olds $100 they will figure out how to spend it. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Who hands a 10-yo $100 and expects them to read their mind about how much of that to spend? Your friend should have learned a valuable lesson. It was not your step-son's fault at all.", "INFO: This story doesnt seem real, she gave Matt $100 dollars at a movie theater, and he could afford more than a small soda and the smell of half an unpopped popcorn kernel?", "She gave a trio of kids that age $100 for snacks at the movie?  Wow.  That was definitely a foolish move on her part.\n\nIt would be a good idea to have a talk with your son about these sorts of situations, though; that when someone else is paying, you should gauge what you order off what they order and get no more than they do.  I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m a big agog that you think this wasn\u2019t excessive - he ordered enough food for 2 reasonable size meals for a kid his age.  That kind of gorging is neither healthy nor polite.", "NTA. I'll say he went overboard with the snacks he ordered, but that's not your fault. You're not wrong that she was rude to come to you demanding you pay half the bill. Next time, she will be more considerate of handing three 10 year olds $100 cash in front of an overpriced consession and then walking away.", "NTA.\n\nMovie concession stands are overpriced (notice the mother assumed it would be more than $50 for three boys), so just handing over the bills and walking away was not wise of the mother. She really was more or less asking for trouble.\n\nBut did they have to order so much junk food? A pretzel tray? What is that? Why not just some popcorn and a drink?\n\nThough I've never understood why people have to eat at the movies in the first place.", "ESH\n\nShe shouldn't have just handed over that much cash. That was not smart. I would have offered to treat, but stayed there and set a limit if the boys started to go overboard, which your son did.\n\nYour son proved that you still have some teaching to do about good manners when someone offers to treat you. You stated that your son was in the process of ordering JUST the pretzel tray *when he believed he was spending his own money*. However *as soon as he learned Stacy was paying*, he decided to splurge and buy: **the pretzel tray, a large soda, a hotdog, a small popcorn and some sweets.**\n\nThat's where you need to step in and teach about manners. He was greedy.\n\nWhat would have been good manners would have been to allow Stacy to pay for his pretzel tray, or perhaps to get the pretzel tray himself and let Stacy pay for something small like a box of candy. Buying $45 worth of food is insane and I don't see how he didn't make himself sick.", "ESH\n\nAs a parent, I'd be pissed that my child had 'the pretzel tray, a large soda, a hotdog, a small popcorn and some sweets'. No one, including a 10 year old child, needs this many empty calories in a 2-hour sitting. \n\nIt's supposed to be a snack. \n\nTo the issue at hand, she handed over $100 to three kids, who were standing in line at a movie theatre snack stand that is notorious for being ridiculously over-priced junk food, and proceeded to walk away. She got 10 year old decision making. \n\nI do find it interesting that she is angry at your child when you inferred that the other two children were hers. Do her own children not know her rules regarding purchasing snacks at the movie theater? Why weren't they voicing the family rules? \n\nWhen my kids were children we were very clear that they were responsible for their friends following household rules. They got one warning, and then we'd step in. If a kid isn't able to stand up to a friend when parents are around, they certainly aren't going to stand up to them when they are unsupervised. Without fail, the 'friends' we had to phase out when they were little ended up being extremely challenging teenagers. \n\nShould your child have clarified a budget, sure. Should your child have exercised more personal restraint in the face of a gleaming display of deliciousness while spending someone else's money, absolutely, if he were an adult. \n\nMy take away is that this woman wasn't providing adequate supervision and your son isn't ready to be unsupervised.", "One ought never order more if someone else is paying than one would if one were paying for oneself. So if Matt was going to buy himself a pretzel tray, and that alone, when he thought he had to pay for it, he shouldn't have added the hotdog *and* the sweets *and* the popcorn (I'll allow the drink). \n\nThat said, it's a fairly subtle point of etiquette, so I don't blame you for not teaching that to a ten-year-old. \n\nPlus, who hands a ten-year-old a hundred and lets him loose at the concessions stand? Just asking for trouble. \n\nThat said, I think Matt should have known, had an adult been doing the ordering, he'd have *never* been allowed to buy all that food for himself. \n\nSo you're NTA. The friends' mom is an asshole, and so is Matt, but less so.", "Apparently I'm in the overwhelming minority but .. YTA. \n\nThis is no different than all the stories about people offering to buy someone dinner, and that person in turn ordering the most expensive thing on the menu plus several drinks. It's rude behavior and this is the PERFECT opportunity to teach your son that. Don't get greedy when someone offers to treat you.", "In what world does a pretzel tray, a hotdog, 3 sodas, a couple of popcorns and some candy total $95?? I mean, I know theatre food is hella expensive, but damn.", "woof. when givers prove unkind. poor kid. he's probably so confused and ashamed. thanks for standing up for him. nta.", "This seems off - why did she give him the money and not her own kids? And how the heck did he carry that much food? And yes, your son did over order - he bought an entree and side (and small popcorns in the US are huge!) on top of ordering the same as what the other kids did. It\u2019s like the second he figured out I he didn\u2019t have to pay, he added more than he could/should reasonably eat.  As an adult, I would think he was greedy and not up to par with manners, but I wouldn\u2019t expect to be paid back for my own lack of supervision. I\u2019d just not handle snacks that way again.

Taking a cue from what others ordered, in the absence of direction, IS good manners. If he had come to the theater with me where we get popcorn and candy then he\u2019d have way overshot the mark and it would be a different story.
