Where I work sick leave can be used for many reasons like taking care of sick kids or sick parents or hell even a sick pet or doctors appointments for yourself or your family member. At that point, it becomes paid time off. As a manager in a professional role, I\u2019m not going to tell someone who doesn\u2019t get sick regularly or have sick kids to not take the sick time they earn.

I hated being like that though, and my team wasn\u2019t thrilled with me, so I shifted to a different mentality - as long as you get your job done & stay in communication, take whatever time off you need. As soon as I started managing this way, productivity & morale improved. I was definitely way too loyal to my companies for a long time. \n\nI was running a remote office so I could run interference on my team\u2019s behalf with HR, so I know it\u2019s not always possible but I just wish more companies would adopt this sort of mentality.
