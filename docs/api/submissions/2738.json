Now with firing co-worker, they are even more short-staffed causing more work for each employee AND even less flexibility for time off. SMH.

If anybody else who was working there was actually sick while OP was on vacation, there was nobody to cover for them.

I heard he was on thin ice", "Nah not in the long run since they would eventually hopefully hire someone who isn't lazy and makes everyone else pick up their slack. A couple weeks of short staff due to management firing someone is worth it if their replacement is good. While I agree that management should probably hire more people, it's not their problem that this guy is a shitty coworker who deserved what he got. Plus he's the one dumb enough to post pics at the beach while being \"sick\".", "The fact that the company would have been fine if the slacker had just done his regular job while OP was on vacation indicates they have enough staff.\n\nWhat you are saying is that they should hire enough people that there'll be someone sitting around all day doing literally nothing because there won't be enough work. Companies cannot afford to do that. That's not how real life works. No one else is required to subsidize your life.", "But nobody asked you to cancel your vacation. Then why are you so resentful ?"]}
