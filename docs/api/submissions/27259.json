Is she the boss? Can you directly contact her parents about the missing wages? This is a pretty serious thing that you could report her for (and should if you don't get those wages).", "NTA keep screenshots of all the texts and seek legal action against her.", "NTA for sure, but be careful holding keys; you may get into trouble for that. As she will if she doesn\u2019t pay you. Let her be the one entirely in the wrong. I\u2019d skip the parents and just file a complaint with the Department of Labor over withheld pay. They will jump on it and get you your money. Keep it impersonal and no contact to the extent possible.", "OP, you are giving her time to create a story. Go around her ND talk with the parents. She does not want to pay you. Legally, she has to.  You already quit due to a fight. Now go fight for your final paycheck.  She wins if you don't,  as she is counting on you not telling the parents/bosses.", "NTA\n\nShe owes you wages.\n\n1. Contact the parents about this.\n\n2. If that doesn't work, report them for wage theft.\n\n3. Inform the new workers that asked you for the keys that you will return them when your owed wages are paid.\n\nThe last one is a bit of a nuclear option, since it will inform the new employees they are working for a shitty employer that might stiff them on wages.", "I don't know in which country you are, but you not returning the keys could be used against you.\n\nI'd say ESH. Even if I understand your frustration, you put yourself in a bad position. Maybe she could change the lock and retain the money from your last pay. You need to start checking what are your rights and hers, and act accordingly.", "NTA they owe you money", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA. Just got straight to the parents, she's not being professional about it", "NTA, locks cost money as well, i guess that's cheaper than paying up. Also i'm guessing you worked under the table? Otherwise you could go to the labor committee for unpaid salary. If you worked under the table, they can't go after you for the keys legally either.", "ESH. They shouldn\u2019t withhold your salary, but neither should you withhold company property after the end of your employment. What they did is wage theft, but that would not absolve you of theft of company property.", "NTA.. nicely done, you triggered the ex boss lady so well..  re trigger her daily by texting pictures of the keys..  just for shits and giggles", "Not at all. You were civil and simply firm in insisting she follow through on paying you. She blew up, not you.\n\nThat being said, I'm not sure keeping property of the company (the keys) was actually legal. She might be able to legally bill you the cost of changing all the locks.\n\nI suggest talking to the government employment bureau and to a small claims lawyer about the unpaid wages. They would both be very interested to hear and would be able to assist with that. You are probably owed more than just the unpaid amount by this time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So I would just say that you just have to tell them what's going on and whatever goes on it just goes on but you just move on from there and live your life because you worked hard for the money you have to get the money that's how business and Labor Works.
