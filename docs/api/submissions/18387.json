We have dinner together every Sunday and I usually make the drive to one of their houses every week. \n\nThis week, there was a birthday party scheduled for my cousins on Saturday also 1 hour and 15 minutes from my house. Meaning I would have to make the drive two days in a row. I asked my dad and sister if they would be willing to come to my house for dinner on Sunday instead of one of their houses so I would not have to make the drive twice. I offered to make all the dinner and provided some options so they could choose what they wanted. \n\nMy dad was happy to be invited to my house and said he's been waiting for an invitation. (I usually make the 1 hour and 15 minutes drive so as not to burden them with it. I think my dad has been to my house for dinner once and my sister has never come.) \n\nMy sister was very angry when I asked her about coming to my house for dinner. She stated I can't expect her to make the 1 hour and 15 minute drive last minute. (I made the request on Saturday when the dinner would be on Sunday. So I do see how this could be considered last minute.) She told me she had plans and did not want to change anything that day. I asked about what time her plans were and offered to work around the plans she had. She told me she had no time frame for her plans and would not go into details about anything.\n\nI told my sister it would be ok if she could not make it to dinner with her plans and that I would not be upset if she decided not to make the drive. She then got more angry with me, accusing me of being defensive and trying to make her angry. She mentioned how the drive of 1 hour and 15 minutes is really annoying and inconvenient. I then brought up how I make the drive every week and have not asked them to make the drive in over a year. I also stated there seems to be a double standard. She told me that is my problem because I chose to move so far away. \n\nI'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.

Your request makes perfect sense, but your sister can't be bothered.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Have your Dad over, and next time when you're doing the driving, she'll be just fine.", "NTA. If you make the drive every week, she can do it once. She has to understand that. If she has plans, she can not come. It's really that simple... it seems really immature of her.", "NTA, I would probably talk to your dad about adding your place into the rotation of Sunday dinners to make the driving a little bit more fair.", "NTA. It's not too much to ask. Curious to know if the outcome would have been different if it was actually planned in advance.", "YNTA at all-your sister is forsure! In fact it's really inconsiderate of her to react like that since you've been doing it for a year and are being accommodating. If your dad is able to drive solo I'd still have the dinner at your place.", "NTA  \n\n\nI can see why this can be upsetting, but if you've had to do the drive multiple times as well, I don't see why your sister wouldn't do the same. She sounds quite selfish. It'll always be a give-and-take and you shouldn't be the only one expected to spend all that time traveling, even though it seems voluntary.", "NTA, not sure why it's an inconvenience for her, but she expects you to do it multiple times and be fine with it.", "NTA, but some people have a very hard time with plans being changed last minute. People on the spectrum for example, but also just people with quirks about it. It could be more the shift of plans than the actual time and drive that is the problem. And that is causing her to act like an ass.", "NTA Your sister's whining about making a drive you make weekly just once (for now, ofc) and is making it a bigger deal than it needs to be. Have the dinner with your dad.", "NTA - sure, it\u2019s an inconvenience to add 2.5 hours to an event you had a certain time allotted to. But her reaction was over the top and unnecessary. She could have easily simply declined and asked you to give her more notice next time. Your reasoning is totally justified and I hope you and your dad have a lovely meal together!", "NTA you\u2019re right it is a double standard. Yeah you should\u2019ve given more notice but if she can\u2019t make it she can\u2019t make it it\u2019s not a big deal", "NTA your sister sounds entitled.", "Nta", ">I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.\n\nThe only thing you did wrong was continue to engage with your sister.

You make the drive twice, the two of them make the drive once.\n\nIf they don't plan to come, make yourself your favorite meal and enjoy leftovers", "Why is there an argument at all?  You invited her, she could not make it for whatever reason, so move on, have your dinner with your dad, then go back to business as usual for the following weekend.  ESH.
