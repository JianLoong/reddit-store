We found out we were pregnant 8 months ago. I'm due on Valentine's Day. This is our first child together and our nerves peaked last month surrounding it because he was laid off unexpectedly. He was a manager at a dispensary and his best friend was the owner. The company slowly started hitting the \"red\" so the guys were really pushing their promoting and getting investors, etc. But it got to a point there where my fiance wasn't paid for a month because the company simply didn't have the funds to pay their employees. He stuck it out with no fuss because he said he \"knew\" the company would make it. And it did, but as soon as they got back in to the \"green\", his friend laid him off and told him the cut was necessary for budgeting. My fiance was then paid all his back paychecks in product (weed, dabs, etc) and my fiance accepted it because it's his friend. I was fuming but there wasn't much I could do. I don't think any real friend would have done what he did.\n\nWe have been full on struggling since that point. He has tried getting on unemployment but was denied (not sure why because he was with the company for over 2 years). Both of us have been applying to multiple different positions and don't even get so much as a rejection email. Just zero response out of the hundreds of apps we have sent out combined. We own our house outright and only pay land tax so that's not so much an issue but we have a baby coming. Like this is a huge deal and we have no money to our name right now (our accounts are literally overdrawn). I've been selling off our stuff just to get by. But regardless, my MIL and my mom threw us a baby shower on Saturday. My fiance's incredibly wealthy aunt and uncle showed up (they have like 6 houses, own 3 companies, no kids and they live out of state). When we got around to opening their gift, it was a check for $30k. They stated that they are getting older now and are trying to put their wealth forward and help people in need and they knew we needed it. They said multiple times that it was \"pocket change\" to them because my fiance immediately said he couldn't take it. And I understand why it would be hard to. I truly do. That's A LOT of money and I would be conflicted as well but we needed this and they were adamant about it being pocket change and kept expressing that they have so much money that they don't know what to do with it and they wanted to help us MORE than that but figured my fiance would have said no so they dropped it to a smaller number. \n\nHe outright refused to take it. And as dramatic as it sounds, it truly ruined my entire day and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. We desperately needed it. He could have started a business and paid his uncle back and I told him that. He immediately told me to drop it and it wasn't my place but I stood firm and said \"this was our out in a hard time and you said no due to your own pride. Pride doesn't buy fucking diapers.\" He is saying I'm in the wrong because it's his family and he has the right to say no.", "created_utc": 1674050850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10f88bq/aita_for_being_upset_that_he_returned_a_check/", "score": 676, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2018s an AH and not ready to be a husband or father. He has a lot of (inner) work to do!", "Wow, NTA. Furious would be an understatement for me. A gift is just that and would have been a tremendous help to you. When you have kids you sometimes have to suck up your pride and sacrifice. I hope he has another plan since he hasn't learned that lesson yet.", "NTA. At all. \n\nFamily dynamics and egos are tough. Egos and pride are also tough. \n\n1) Your husband should have insisted on being paid with actual cash from his job. Weed and dabs are cool for college kids but he has a freaking baby on the way!! And that only benefits one person- the person ingesting or smoking it. Not you or the baby. \n\n2) when you literally have no money, you can\u2019t be picky about where it comes from. Perhaps you can make contact with the aunt and set up a little fund for Baby with the understanding that the use of the money will improve the child\u2019s life. If your husband insists on not taking it, perhaps you can ask Rich Auntie and Uncle to set up the fund and give you access. His ego is preventing his child from having a stable environment. Do what is best for your child and your family. Baby\u2019s health and security has to come first.", "NTA. I would be so furious that I\u2019d seriously consider ending the relationship over this.\n\nYou are completely right: this would\u2019ve been your way out of a seriously hard time, and he is refusing to take it because of his pride, which won\u2019t buy diapers or food or clothes or anything your child will definitely need. He is putting his need to save face before the welfare of his future wife and, more importantly, child.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than that: the two of you are supposed to get married. You are supposed to be linking your fates, to share the rest of your lives, to become one family. And yet, he has told you that he doesn\u2019t see you as an equal partner who has just as much of a say when it comes to important decisions, like the decision whether or not you\u2019ll be comparably financially stable or not for a while. Of course he may say that it\u2019s because you\u2019re not his wife yet, just his fianc\u00e9e, but from the moment you agree to marry one another, you should be making life-altering decisions together. He doesn\u2019t want to do that, he doesn\u2019t want to take your input and your needs seriously, especially not when it would inconvenience him or hurt his pride. Is that seriously someone you want to marry?", "NTA - your husband is not a good provider and you are going to struggle with this for a long time to come.\n\nHe put his pride before the welfare of his child. That tells you what kind of father he's going to be.", "NTA.\n\ntell him that you can't feed and cloth a baby with pride.\n\nAlso make sure he understand that his \"friend\" screwed him by \"paying\" him with drugs, and his moronic pride prevented him from suing his ass for this illegal solution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry to tell you, but I feel that the real troubles with your fianc\u00e9 haven't even started, because the real issues comes with the pressure of taking care of a new born", "NTA. I get where he\u2019s coming from but he needs to be realistic and his family is offering BOTH of you that security not just him. He rejected the help they were offering you as well.", "NTA\n\nHis \"pride\" and \"friends\" count more than his family and I doubt it will change \ud83d\ude14\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Oof... this is a much bigger issue than the money. So many bad decisions here that just completely ignored his responsibility as a partner & a parent. This is not good.\n\nI\u2019m going to give you really horrible advice but I hope you take it.

You need to protect yourself & your child. \n\nNTA\n\neta \u2014 btw he lost his right to say \u201cNo\u201d to anything that helps his family when he decided to have a child.", "NTA. Unless this large extremely help gift would come with strings attached, he\u2019s putting his pride and ego ahead of his now family\u2019s needs. Same as he did with the friend and his business! That was a disaster and he handled that all wrong imo. Weed, dabs etc doesn\u2019t pay the bills. For him to say it\u2019s not your place is also disrespectful and selfish. If this is the type of Ann he is, can you see yourself raising a child with him? Putting his own ego and pride before the needs of his child and stb wife? I think I\u2019d be reevaluating a lot here.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd I'm usually the last person to lean into hyperbole, but in this case (and as someone old enough to be your mum), I will not hesitate to tell you that **for your safety, and the safety and well-being of your soon-to-be born child, I think you need to seriously consider leaving this man**. And if you cannot bring yourself to do that, then you need to INSIST that he go to marriage counselling with you, no compromises. And here's why:\n\nHe has now shown you TWICE that he will prioritise \"saving face\" (i.e. his ego) above even ensuring that you and your child are safe and have what you need to keep a roof over your head and food on the table. That is not a small thing, it is everything, because it means that you cannot trust him. Not ever. \n\nFirst, he allowed a \"friend\" to take advantage of him for an extended period of time (and you're right that that person wasn't a friend). And maybe that could have been seen as him having a good heart. But when he allowed that person to \"pay\" him for WEEKS worth of labour in cannabis products, he showed that he is so insecure and immature that he was more worried about what this person - who had been taking advantage of him for weeks - thought of him, and of not seeming \"uncool\" or making a fuss, than he was about being able to buy food or other necessities for his household, including his very pregnant wife. \n\nThen, in the midst of a financial crisis, and with your baby coming any time, he refused a generous gift from family (not even a loan, which you could maybe say he was nervous about repaying), *again, entirely to \"save face\" -* not for any meaningful reason other than his perception that he needs to put a certain impression of himself out into the world, and this is more important to him than for you to be able to buy food, or baby necessities, or pay the land taxes that allow you to keep your home. He also did so unilaterally, against your wishes, indicating that he thinks he has veto power over you in your household and relationship. \n\nYour husband is desperately immature and self-involved, and that's awful, but more than that, it has reached a point where it is DANGEROUS for you and your child. He is putting his self-image literally above your basic needs. And he genuinely believes that he has the right to  REFUSE HELP that you desperately need because it bruises his ego.\n\nPlease, I know you love him, but he is going to leave you destitute. This is a man who would rather be broke and starving but protect his image than protect the people he loves. You are NTA, but you need to walk away. Let him ruin his own life, but DO NOT let him do this to you and your child.", "NTA- You\u2019re exactly right, pride doesn\u2019t buy diapers. Pride doesn\u2019t cover medical expenses, and pride certainly does not put food on the table. To me, it sounds like your partner is disappointed in himself for \u201cputting\u201d your family in this position. Even though the unemployment wasn\u2019t technically his fault, it\u2019s pretty clear he blames himself. And now maybe he feels like the only way to rectify is by fixing the situation himself? He seriously needs to take a step back, look at the situation with a little humility, and stop trying to save the day. You haven\u2019t lost respect for him despite poor decisions at his last job, so why would accepting this money change that? Respectfully, your partner is being the AH here for choosing to allow his child to come into the world when you two are financially unprepared. Does he think it will get any easier to find a job in a couple weeks when you\u2019re taking care of the new baby? He needs to get over himself, go back to the aunt and uncle and beg for that check.", "Nta\n\n\nWords can not express how mad I would be.\n\n\nWhen you have a child to consider, it's not about you and your pride.\n\nHe is basically screwing your whole family over.\n\nIf you're in the States Maternity polices are all over the place. After you go on leave there is a good chance you are losing money as well.", "NTA... Your husband has made the dumbest of decisions throughout all of this.  He stayed with a failing company that couldn't pay him because bros I guess.  After that investment, he's laid off & accepts payment in weed.  So now that he's made those dumb decisions, you're broke af... But wait, super wealthy aunt & Uncle gift you a substantial amount of money for your upcoming baby.  The day is saved right?  Wrong!  Husband then proceeds to refuse the gift of this desperately needed resource because he is now feeling emasculated... Where was this \"pride\" when he got taken for a ride by his \"friend\"?  So would he accept $30,000 in weed?  His \"friend\" doesn't care if you guys tank financially.  His family members do, and have $30,000 to give you without consequence.  Honestly, I would go stay with a family member or friend bc I would be seriously considering the trajectory of my life unless something changes drastically.  His dumb decisions contributed greatly to you both being in this mess to begin with.", "NTA that was irresponsible of him. Putting pride before practicality is never the right move.", "NTA - you are 100% right, pride didn\u2019t take care of a child. The fact he would not even get paid for what he worked is bad enough, but him then doing this is just wrong. Does he want you to be homeless? How much does he think children cost? What is is foolproof grand plan to somehow get money quickly to be ready for a child? \nSorry to say but you are married to an extremely selfish man. Taking fun substances instead of payment and then rejecting money cause it hurts his pride. Why stay with him? He is dragging you down", "\u201cPride doesn\u2019t fucking buy diapers\u201d -op \nAgreed.\nNTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re spot on about his pride being the issue here. Doesn\u2019t sound like he is giving any other reason why. Also, by the sounds of it they were giving it to the both of you, not just him so should be a joint decision. (Especially if when he makes decisions on his own he accepts back pay in the form of dabs). But dude, why does the poor baby have to miss out because of his pride?", "NTA, clearly his pride is more important than rent and food for his very pregnant fianc\u00e9e and soon to be baby. \n\nIf it\u2019s his choice not to take the money, ask what his plan is, cause a newborn has no use for weed. Then consider appealing the unemployment, from what I\u2019ve seen they often knock people back unfairly the first time.", "The fact that he was denied unemployment suggests that there's more to the \"layoff\" than you are being told. For example, was he really paid in product, or did he get fired because he was helping himself to product?", "NTA. You are absolutely right, pride doesn't buy diapers", "NTA - clearly he put his childish pride ahead of taking care of the family.", "NTA.  If you are on good terms with them, maybe you can calmly ask if they'd be okay putting the money into a trust for the baby. Your fianc\u00e9 let his pride and poor choices tank your finances twice now, maybe you can at least help baby in the future.", "NTA - Start running around with a spreadsheet and calculator on everything that will be needed for the baby in the next year broken down by month - diapers, food, detergent, formula, doctor visits, clothes, furniture, toiletries and ask him how you guys will manage all this. Put the real numbers in his face to feel the weight. And pray that the baby doesn\u2019t have allergies/dietary restrictions that would require organic/special foods.\n\nHe def put his stupid pride before his family but there\u2019s a chance he doesn\u2019t realize the full weight of what he\u2019s done. \n\nMake him feel it and to figure it out.", "NTA but your husband is. It wasn\u2019t a gift just to him so it wasn\u2019t just his decision. He reacted emotionally and didn\u2019t consider your equal vote or the reality of the situation. This was all about his ego.", "Just a little hint, but the reason he couldn't get unemployment is because it wasn't paid in on him. He most likely was getting paid under the table so there's no record of him working there. Legitimate employers do not pay in weed and dabs.", "His family and he does have the right to say no. BUT...you are right. Pride doesn\u2019t buy diapers. I hope you\u2019ve signed up (assuming you\u2019re in the US) for WIC, food stamps and such. WIC, in a lot of locations, will offer at a minimum a set of cloth diapers. Look for local resources. I know where I live some food pantries have diapers and formula as well. Luckily you don\u2019t need a lot with babies. If it were me, I\u2019d risk upsetting my husband by giving his aunt and uncle our water company information and electric company information. At least they could keep the power on for you.", "NTA. Call the aunt and uncle. Tell them you won\u2019t let your husband\u2019s pride harm your family. Tell them you will gladly accept as much as they were originally planning to offer. Your husband isn\u2019t stepping up so you have to.", "NTA. You have the right to drop this loser.

I'm sure there are exceptions but you generally have to be fired, not laid off, to be denied. Or he was working under the table and never legally employed there, which seems possible since not paying employees is all kinds of illegal and most businesses will try hard to avoid that. \n\nIn any case I'd be seriously rethinking my future raising a child with someone who will place their pride above desperately needed money and take weed in lieu of a back pay", "NTA and technically that baby is also his family's family.. so his comment of it being \"his family\" is moot once that child is born.  Id go talk to the aunt and do the trust situation proposed earlier.  Things are only getting more expensive right now and that baby needs support as do you.", "It wasn't your place? Oh no, you are carrying his baby and it damn well IS your place! The decision to keep the money or not was a decision to be made by BOTH of you, with the baby's well-being as the priority.

Your husband is putting his ego above everything else and is acting selfishly. That\u2019s enough for me to considering asking for the cheque anyway and cashing it and if the husband has that big of a problem with it, he can leave if his pride is more important", "NTA and providing for your child comes before your petty pride, remind your husband of that", "NTA but your fianc\u00e9 sounds like he\u2019s really not smart. \n\nIt\u2019s NEVER a good idea to work for a friend. It always ruins friendships and the employee will almost always get screwed over. \n\nHe waited it out both while still working and after getting laid off before getting terminated. He knew he has no income and didn\u2019t care. Irresponsible. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 accepted wages in product instead of a paycheck. There was no need for that. If the business was back in the green, he should have paid the back wages. Because in all fairness the business isn\u2019t in the green until ALL it\u2019s back debt is paid. So if they\u2019re in the green, they had the money to give him his paycheck. It seems like he was trying to appease his friend and or wanted the fun product more than the money. \n\nHe got denied unemployment\u2026\nINFO: did he try to appeal it? If not, why? This is very common with unemployment. The business owners almost always refuse to pay unemployment and the unemployed have to appeal to let unemployment determine if they are eligible. \n\nEither way it was bad career and livelihood choices. He clearly has no concerns about money. \n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that he doesn\u2019t care about the money from his relatives. And told them no. It\u2019s unfortunate that he is putting his pride before his child\u2019s safety and well being. He\u2019s immature and too arrogant and not ready to be a husband or a father.

Go to your relatives and ask if you can take the check, which you should then put into a separate account. Do NOT let him start his own business with it. He clearly lacks business sense; look what happened with his friend's business! What his friend did was illegal but your fianc\u00e9 let it happen. Your fianc\u00e9 will get mad if you take the money; he might even threaten to leave. But the alternative is that you won't even have the money to pay your hospital bill when you give birth. The alternative is that you won't have money to care for your baby. You are going to be a parent very soon; you have to put your child first, even if your fianc\u00e9 refuses to do so just because of his foolish pride.

His ego is running his thoughts and he\u2019s driving you down a spiral.  Taking payment in product was an idiotic move in the first place.  Refusing the help is so unbelievably stupid that words cannot coney the level.  You really need to sort him out and fast.  Is it your house, his, or both?  If its yours kick him out temporarily.  If its his, move out temporarily.  Maybe it will kick start him.\n\nAre you sure he was fired from his old job?  Not sure where you\u2019re from but it\u2019s very hard to get denied unemployment in Canada, not sure about elsewhere.  Could he have quit?", "NAH.  That is ROUGH.  I can understand why you're upset, you are having a baby and it seems your partner is choosing pride over protecting your family.  But, it was his to reject and I guess you have to accept that.

If he can come up with $30k in one week then you don\u2019t accept the generous gift from the family. Seems fair.", "NTA\n\nReconsider raising a child with this person. He clearly isn't ready to be a father.  Loving adoptive parents would be far better than a man that thinks being paid in MJ is acceptable with a baby on the way and spits on people who are trying to help.", "NTA. Sorry to say it but you married an idiot. It\u2019s like the story about the flood where the man is sitting on the roof of his house when a boat rows by and offers to take him. \u201cNo, God will save me\u201d. Then a helicopter hovers overhead and offers him a lift. \u201cNo, God will save me\u201d. The waters rise and he drowns; at the pearly gates he asks why God didn\u2019t save him. \u201cI sent you a boat and a helicopter, what more do you want?\u201d\n\nShow him the responses to your post and tell him to take the damn help.", "NTA- but I have to know, does your husband happen to be named Walter White?", "NTA\n\nCan you contact the relative privately and explain the situation and have her send you the money? \n\nI hope your fianc\u00e9 understands that you will be taking handouts via government assistance if he hates handouts so much. Does he want you to all starve?", "Ten bucks says your fianc\u00e9 got rejected for unemployment because his \u201cfriend\u201d was paying him under the table and hadn\u2019t reported him as an employee. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is a terrible judge of people and risk. It\u2019s the same thing that led him to reject his family\u2019s check. He\u2019s not likely to change either, sadly. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He has a new family now, with you and the bump - he needs to get over himself.", "NTA\n\nBut maybe tax implications should be explored. They could gift you 10k, him 0k, and the baby 10k", "NTA\n\nYou've got a baby on the way, and while it is his family, that check was made out for both of you. How heartbreaking.", "OP not the AH but H surely is TAH and needs to start growing up from accepting pay in product to returning badly needed money", "NTA- there might be more to the story, but he owes you more of an explanation than to tell you to drop it.", "Just want to add, please go to your local health department and sign up for WIC if you're in the US. It should at least help you and baby with some basics. And they'll also get you enrolled in Medicaid. Hoping for the best for you and baby. You might be the only reliable parent your kid will have.", "What do you mean! He\u2019s got plenty of dabs and bud to forget about them", "I wonder if he refused to apply for unemployment because he doesn\u2019t want handouts", "I work in banking that has offices across multiple states and will say that the federal government has come up with new policies that now allow federally governed (FDIC) banks to lend on marijuana related products (ETA: dispensaries, growing facilities, that kind of product aka commercial loans). There are serious restrictions and massive oversight on it, but it got much better in the last 2-3 years.", "Not to be a pita but unemployment does not get withheld from employees checks. The employer funds it all and submits the funds to the State - usually on a quarterly basis.The amount you pay as an employer is based on a percentage of gross wages paid to employees. The State sets the percentage based on  how many unemployment claims have been paid out in the prior period. I suspect he couldn't get unemployment because he was being paid \"under the table.\"  Reference: 30 years of processing payroll and quarterly payroll reports including unemployment. \ud83d\ude42", "NTA\n\nI got a much smaller gift ($50) from a colleague along with a card stating I need to learn to accept gifts and they were right.  Letting family pay forward something like this brings them joy and helps you.   Maybe a single polite refusal, but then complete gratitude.  They want to help, let them help.", "Hey op Nta but I imagine the aunt and uncle are still willing to give the money possibly more why not ask them to give you a check directly. I mean why does your husband get to unilaterally make a huge financial decision that could benefit the both of you", "I'd take the money & go forward with living. That will go along ways to helping y'all! It's your family, so you have a say in that!", "He is setting you both up to fail over his pride.\n\nAsk him WHERE the money for the new baby is going to come from? \n\nDefinitely not the invisible money tree growing in the back yard.  NTA", "NTA BUT...let me get this straight. \n\nHis company illegally paid him in product (my ex works in the industry, in collections, it is NOT legal to pay in product anywhere in the US) and then fired him and then messed up the unemployment???\n\nThere are 2 ways this actually went down. \n\n1. His friend is a criminal who did a bunch of illegal stuff and then either claimed your fiance was fired so no unemployment or never paid the employer portion if unemployment insurance. If this is the case he needs to report his friend to the state board, sue the business, and demand unemployment.  \n\n2. He STOLE the product and was fired or was fired and stole the prpduct.\n\nEither way...he has a baby on the way and is flat out failing you and the baby.  Likely he is favoring his criminal friend at your expense. He is now denying family support. He is likely trying to get child support from you. Throw him out.", ">My fiance's incredibly wealthy aunt and uncle \n\nYTA. His family members, his decision. They definitely didn't give you the gift just because of you, they gave it to you because you're with their nephew.", "Why haven't you asked him why his unemployment was denied? Seems kind of important since you seem to think he should qualify...maybe he didn't actually apply bc his \"friend\" asked him not to (his unemployment taxes may go up, for instance). At any rate, NTA, your fiance is though. I would be very hesitant to build a life with someone this irresponsible (including accepting payment in weed) and prideful, who seemingly puts friends above family and doesn't look out for the best interest of his family.", "NTA he is an idiot. If he wants you can repay once you are in a better position but you are not in a position to refuse.\nRefusing a gift is pretty lame.", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 more likely isn\u2019t getting unemployment because the \u201cfriend\u201d said he quit instead of being fired. Or fianc\u00e9 pride is so great he is purposely filling out the forms wrong, so he doesn\u2019t get a handout from anyone.", "Weed doesn't buy diapers either.\n\nNTA.", "this is the worst way to be. it's not being any less adult to accept help. no human being should have to struggle. whether OP helped them become below poverty or not, it still was very wrong of him to not accept a no strings attached money offer like that. it would have really helped them not struggle. you're dumb if you wouldn't take the money, truly. ego is not more important than surviving. NTA OP.", "He was probably rejected for unemployment because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level. I have no idea if that means that you can pay unemployment tax or not. As far as the feds are concerned, he may not have been working for the past several years.", "u/Crafty_Preference_25 In case you didn't know you could do this, sign up ASAP.\n\nI'm not pregnant but this is a nice thing to know!", "That\u2019s not how it works, she\u2019s married, they will make him pay, therefore they\u2019re still stuck with the bill.", "She wasn't always pregnant.", "NTA & I would not marry this guy", "NTA ask him how that pride is going to handle having to apply for WIC and other forms of programs for the poor due to all HIS mistakes?", "NTA.  This is foolish pride on his part and I hope he comes to realise that.  You need to be eating decent food because you\u2019re pregnant and for breastfeeding your baby.  You\u2019re absolutely right , and the time for handling back checks is when you don\u2019t need them, not when you\u2019re in dire need.  It\u2019s quite possible that he has offended his aunt and uncle in refusing the gift.  Clearly he hasn\u2019t hit rock bottom yet.  If he even mentions being hungry, cold, unable to afford gas, not able to pay your medical bills, you just say nothing at all in the loudest way possible - with your stone faced look.  And he best be out of the house all day until the baby is born looking for work from early morning til late at night.  All he gets now is baked beans because you can\u2019t afford anything else and you need the nourishment.  Seriously, he\u2019s an idiot and you deserve better.  I hope he crawls back to his uncle and aunt for their small change.", "There's also the possibility that the fianc\u00e9's friend/ boss continued giving him the runaround regarding back pay. Being as prideful as he seems, he may have willfully neglected to tell OP that he got scammed by his friend and \"helped himself\" to product as a way of making sure he got something in return for sticking it out when they weren't paying him.", "NTA and your man is being horribly prideful and I'm sorry to hear that.  I know fianc\u00e9 is hurting and can't see the forest through the trees. I'm glad you stated your POV, it wasn't off and sadly that's all you can do.\n\nThe impetus is truly now on your future husband to step it up and figure out how to get out of your financial straights.  Hopefully you can let this go and have faith things will turn around.", "NTA , Tell him it becomes your business the monent you two stayed together and had a child together. if he didn't want to hear this discussion then he shouldn't have dated anyone or gotten anyone pregnant at all. If he can't get money elsewhere then he should've taken it so the pregnant mother of his baby, and his baby, don't have to suffer. He is more obligated to you guys than his pride.", "NTA    Call your aunt and uncle and ask them to deposit that money in an account with only your name on it.  You're not so smart fianc\u00e9 can suck eggs.  Taking product rather than actual money owed is just plain STUPID.  With a child on the way? You really really need to take a long hard look at this relationship and how you see your future and how your child's future will be affected by a man with this much ego and disregard for your well-being.", "NTA. Please update us OP.  Tell us how your fiance fed his family on pride. :(", "Girl! I don\u2019t know what to tell you. But I\u2019d consider calling his aunt, apologizing and saying your family could really use the money. Deposit it into a bank account that only you have access to and only use that money for necessities for you and your baby. Good luck!", "*He immediately told me to drop it and it wasn't my place*   \n\n\nHow is it not your place to point out that you as a family need this money?", "NTA- \nBut your fianc\u00e9, he sure as hell is TA.", "NTA. Call that aunt and uncle and tell them that you have no money and both accounts are overdrawn, and if they still were offering, you\u2019d love to accept their generous gift. FUCK YOUR BABY DADDY. Accepts his fucking wage in weed and then says NO THANKS to 30K with no money in the bank and a baby being born in a month?\n\nYou do ANYTHING you have to do mumma", "I completely agree with this. I\u2019ll emphasize that I think counseling could be hugely beneficial, not just because he is displaying self centered and egocentric tendencies, but he may be dealing with very real challenges. There is tremendous societal pressure on men, particularly fathers, to be good providers for their families. It\u2019s entirely possible he is feeling extremely inadequate and like a failure because of your situation, and this check from very wealthy family who view that amount so small, simply reinforced that feeling.\n\nIn either case therapy seems a solid course of action, otherwise I agree with above that a separation could be needed.", "It WAS NOT his to reject. It was a gift to both of them. A gift they need largely because of his horrendous decision making.", "I was on unemployment after I lost my job at a dispensary. I claimed my income on my taxes prior to that. I got paid on paper checks, the dispensary had money in the bank and insurance for property damage. It's above board enough for the IRS and state unemployment", "It's not a huge assumption.
