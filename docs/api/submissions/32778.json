I've been a bridesmaid too many times to count.  Almost always, I get paired off with another single guy.\n\nMy family and friends treat this as an attempt to hook me up with other single guy.  They think it will be so romantic if we tell our grandkids who we met at a wedding.\n\nI've never been interested in these guys.  At the last wedding I was at, I was paired off with the groom's 42-year-old stepbrother.  Off the bat, I wasn't interested in Dave.  If I were to see his profile on a dating app, I would immediately swipe left.  \n\nBack to this wedding.  I get through the ceremony and am now at the reception.  I run into some old friends haven't seen in a long time and didn't know they would be in town.  So we spent the night together, catching up and covertly watching a VGK game someone was streaming on their phone.  \n\nThe bride came up to me and asked if I wanted to sit with Dave.  He was alone at a table and wanted to get to know me better.  I told her, sorry, I wasn't interested, and went back to talking with my friends.  If Dave wanted to talk to me, well he's a grown man and can do it himself.  \n\nI spend the night hanging out with my friends, having a great time, and didn't think much of it until a few weeks later.  I see the bride at a party and she doesn't even greet me.  She just tells me that I was a b---- for ignoring Dave.  Apparently he thought I was cute and wanted to get to know me better.  He just couldn't because he struggles with social cues.  At least I could have just saw with him for a few minutes and be nice to him.  First off, I am sick of being nice just to make a man happy.  I told her that I was just there to be a bridesmaid, not to be a minder for a middle-aged man.\n\nShe still called me out for being a rude, stuck up B.  \n\nWas I the asshole?  Or was the bride being out of line.\n\nOne more thing, a few months before the wedding, I started to see a guy I met at a conference.  I never told anyone because I wasn't sure if the relationship would last at the time.  I don't plan on telling anyone until we hit a milestone because there would be some pushback (it's an international LDR).
