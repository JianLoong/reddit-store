The weekend he went to see them alone, I would go to my mom. \n\n\nSince my mom in law passed we go every other weekend as his dad is 86 and we live closer then his siblings. Every 2 months we have a big get together with siblings and niblings and their kids. And most of the time my mom and sister would join then too. \n\n\nWe also have firm boundaries for visiting us. A call at least 2 days in advance and a no is no. The only one that can sometimes break this is his son. He has a hard job and sometimes passes by after his shift if it was an exceptionally brutal one. That can even be in the middle of the night. But that happens maybe once or twice a year.", "NTA.

And I have dinner at my mother every week as well.\n\nAnd we spend time with some of his extended family every Sunday night. \n\nThere's no obligation, when people can't they don't show. There's no need to provide a reason, just a heads up because of the amount of food.\n\nSo he's not an AH for wanting to go there every weekend. You're not an AH for not wanting to go there every weekend. \n\nBut you guys need to learn to communicate and respect each other.", "NTA. You have a serious husband problem. I don't think he's willing to change, so you're badly overdue to change either your location or your state of wedlock.", "NTA, he\u2019s rude for making plans without consulting you.

Honestly you should have done that from the beginning. I would demand one weekend a month that is just for you as a couple.", "NTA does he not have any friends or hobbies?

Of course you should make an effort to have a good relationship with your in-laws, but they're his family not yours. He should understand that. Surely every other weekend is enough.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" It's been this way every since.\" .. And only YOU can change that - so start NOW.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake a new rule: Sit him down and tell him: When your husband agrees without asking for your availability, he has to go alone. YOu will make your own decissions. He very likely handles it the same way - if he says he doesn't just makeother plans for the next 3 weekends and just tell him this are the plans. Either he will agree, and No in-laws, or he will have to admit he was not honest.  \n\n\n  \n\"Sometimes if I don't go with him his mom will text me asking why I didn't come.\" ..

It depends on what their relationship is. It depends on what the husband tells his mother. It may just be the MIL trying to reach out to understand if there's anything wrong. There are too many variables."]}
