Patents don\u2019t usually get a day of every week and really they need to have kids that are better behaved if they want a better response.

But are you really wondering why the twins don't understand no, if the parents clearly don't understand it either?\n\nNo one is entitled to another persons time and effort. Personally, I'd have added, that people might be happier to agree to babysit, if the twins were more of a pleasure to be around. Still, expecting others to do my job is never appropriate. I also wouldn't call my sister to clean my bathroom, because I had a hard week, why should anybody expect different with childcare? It is hard work. That's why people get paid to do it. \n\nI'm so tired of family members feeling entitled to all kinds of ressources like time, money, gifts, efforts.

I swear it seems that they see kid as an accessory that they can dump when they want to. A disabled child physically or intellectually needs extra care and I understand respite care. But outside of that you've signed up for 24/7 on call parenting and if you're not good with that you shouldn't have kids. I'd go as far as saying you don't deserve kids. It's not fair on the child or others. The whole gentle parenting thing is mind-blowing. These same parents will be flabbergasted in the future \"I have no idea why he's/she's like this\".
