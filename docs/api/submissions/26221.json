If I was a better communicator I definitely would have said, \u201cNo. We already planned this and we can have steak with your parents another time.\u201d", "Kids can also pick up on the feeling of love that their grandpa has for them. It's not like they are made to care for grandma. \n\nAlso OP's wife sounds callous, she wants her parents around all the time but can't do tge same for her husband. What is 1 hour commute weekly? Nothing, atleast not that much.\nOP is NTA", "They both love going over there", "And maybe ask ILs to invite dad over occasionally to give dad others nearer his age to talk to/divert his pain with more people and to take some pressure off of the kids. The kids don't need to be entertaining either set of Gparents. Wife gets time with her parents, you get time with dad, dad gets time away to decompress and see kids, kids get both gparents knocked out in one visit.\n\nNTA", "Yes - he made it seem like once a week was so rare - but that is so much.  I also feel like her parents stopping by all the time comes in a totally different context with an infant in the house - they are bringing food and cleaning and watching the baby so she can shower- that is helping and not just a social visit.  No way would I want to drive an hour away once a week with a four month old.", "Your four month old?  Your four month old 'loves' going over there?  Really?  You could have convinced me on the toddler but now you're projecting.  \n\nLook - you left out a lot that makes it clear these situations cannot be compared.  Your in laws bringing food over when you have an infant in the house and traveling an hour to visit your parents with an infant and a toddler are not the same.  How often have you made that trip since the baby was born?  It sucks that your parents can't help you out the same way that hers can, but these are apples and oranges.      Also with the baby only four months old it's much less shocking your wife doesn't want you to take the kids alone.  \n\nIt's not that you are an asshole in this interaction, but that you seem to have a very skewed sense of how these situations are compared and how much stress this is probably causing.", "Yep. I also think this is setting some extremely unhealthy patterns. How long does this go on for? Interestingly, this doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with seeing his mother and spending time with her before she passes (whenever that may be), it\u2019s all about the respite for his dad. This could go on for YEARS. It\u2019s not sustainable, nor is it healthy for his dad OR his kids, for his kids to basically be his dad\u2019s only source of happiness. Removing the increasing strain for a moment. What happens when the kids start school, have activities? OP needs to funnel some of this time and energy into finding alternative respite for his dad."]}
