I know that doesn\u2019t sound far for most but with our situation it can be difficult. My in-laws live less than ten minutes away. My mom has frontotemporal dementia and my dad is her only caretaker. Everyday for him is hell and his only major solace is when he gets to see my son and daughter. Since they live far, we only get to see each other once every week/week and a half or so AT BEST. My wife\u2019s parents, on the other hand, get to see them whenever they want and often make unannounced visits to our house. I really don\u2019t mind that and in fact they usually bring over leftovers or stuff for the kids, so I am very grateful for them. Just saying they see the kids way more often than my parents do.\n\nToday we had planned to go to my parents. I know my dad could really use a cheer up because my mom\u2019s dementia has gotten worse and he\u2019s having a very hard time coping. As I\u2019m packing bags with toys and spare clothes, etc, my wife comes in and says, \u201cMy dad is making steak tonight and wants us to come over\u201d.

My dad is losing his mind and he needs to see his grandkids.\u201d She just kind of slowly nodded and stared at her phone. I can tell she doesn\u2019t want to go. If it comes to it I will suggest that I just take the kids myself so that she can go have steak with her parents but I know she will say no.\n\nEDIT: I know she\u2019ll say no to the compromise because I\u2019ve offered this on several other similar occasions and she always says that if she\u2019s going to her parents for dinner she doesn\u2019t want to go alone, she wants to bring the kids.", "created_utc": 1693849633, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169ynwp/aita_for_wanting_to_bring_our_kids_to_see_my/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
