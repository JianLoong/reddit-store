A \"safe\" area today may not be a \"safe\" area tomorrow.  Crime occurs everywhere, even in the safest areas.  Your neighbors may be totally unaware of what really goes on in the neighborhood at night.

It's your property, and you have every right to monitor it with cameras. Terrible things happen in safe neighborhoods.  There's no one \"guarding the gate\" to make sure only \"good\" people get in. And honestly, safe neighborhoods are more enticing in some ways.  People aren't as likely to have cameras or lock their doors; they're more likely to say hello to someone walking down the street than call the cops on 'em.  Safe neighborhoods tend to have people with more money and therefore nicer things to steal. \n\nAnd let's be real... If one of your neighbors' cars goes missing or home gets broken into, they're totally coming to you to see if you've got anything on video.", "NTA\n\nJust because a neighborhood is considered safe doesn't mean it actually is.
