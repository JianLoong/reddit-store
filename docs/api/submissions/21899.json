You promised your wife time away from the dog. Its pretty bad that even the sitter couldn\u2019t last the full 5 days dog sitting. Idk what you do from here but I hope you realize that the dog is ruining your marriage. And I\u2019m a dog lover myself. I have two of my own and love them like my furry kids.

Your wife said as clearly as humanly possible that if she didn\u2019t get a real break from this dog, she would get up and leave. She tried to have a tiny, less than weeklong break from the dog and she didn\u2019t get it. So she got up and left. That\u2019s not overreacting, that\u2019s just reacting in the exact way that she told you she would. \n\nPlease, for the sake of your marriage and kids, rehome this dog and start listening to your wife when she expresses her boundaries.

Let the dog starve and shit all over the house for 2 days on its own? I don't see much alternative to picking the dog up and I think your wife should have realised that there was little alternative also (ESH). I also think your compromise of sleeping in the tent with the dog was a good idea.", "Esh - then your buddy needs to volunteer to watch her. Your wife told you she was at her limit (although after 3 years, I have no idea why now). Why would you bring the dog back to the campsite?", "ETA, while I do think your wife is overreacting a little, you could've at least talked to her before you went to get the dog, so that she knew and would be prepared", "I would say NAH and that you should consider looking into a family that can suit the dogs needs becuase your wife is clearly fed up and your kids don't seem to like the dog eithier I mean I know it's hard letting go of a pet becuase they are part of the family but at this point it might not be possible to keep both. You have to put the dog and your wife first and clearly the solution is not to keep them toghether.\n\nOr you could also be the meme it's eithier me or the dog and chose the dog you told her just like that just like that", "YTA", "The dog needs to go", "My wife is at home with the dog the most from Monday-Wednesday. I work on the farm Thursday-Sunday and have the dog with me those days mostly but she also follows me everywhere so when I go indoors, she does too and she excessively whines the whole time or high pitch yip barks. So I get it but still. The boys are young (4yo twins and 6) and aren't really fans of the dog either.", "There are a few posts which come up close together, and have very similar main details, but the filler details are completely different.", "I saw a very similar post but with woodpecker ig? \nVery similar, from the husband's pov again.", "Amen. My ex chose his dogs over me. The husky was fixated with going after my cat, and the cat was going to end up injured or worse if it kept up. The dog was chasing and trying to bite/snap at the cat unprovoked. Even snapping at her through a muzzle. So my cat was constantly vocalizing to tell the dog to steer clear of her. His other dog was partially blind and elderly. Fond of whining and loud panting for every single thing, as she'd obviously gotten away with it in the past. Her breath is horrendous and hee whole body felt gross to the touch FYI. We found out part of that was because she was peeing herself in her sleep multiple times per day. No medical reason. It was causing the house to be unsanitary (she would wriggle out of diapers if on carpet, but linoleum made her super witchy and cranky), and my son is an asthmatic. I hit my breaking point with two dogs causing different problems and him not fixing either one. I also have sensory issues and fixate on out of place sounds, like his dog constantly panting. I have tried, and cannot find a way to stop fixating on sounds. \n\nHe chose to move out over me and my kids. Good riddance, as my cat is finally back to her barely vocalizing self and is really relaxed again. I was literally walling off one side of the living room with an accordion room divider to give her and I a dog-free space. She spends 75% or more of the time I am home and awake on my recliner with me, as I raised her from birth (she was orphaned at 3.5 weeks old when her mama, my barn cat, up and disappeared). My ex is too sedentary in his lifestyle choices to have a husky, but soaks up the praise for having such a pretty dog. So yes to your conclusion that this guy is TA.", "Here\u2019s hoping", "No. You stay home with the dog. Obviously.", "She told me I should have stayed home with the dog instead of impeding on her peace because she was the one who needed the break, not me.", "She's probably underreacting.  I can't imagine how much stress having the dog around would be, let alone on top of medical problems and 3 young kids.", "Your wife seems to be taking care of 3 quite young children full-time plus, much of the time, a very difficult dog. This would be extremely stressful for anyone, much less someone you acknowledge has properly diagnosed health conditions. \n\nSeveral months ago she broke down and said you needed to do something about the dog. You tried, with the training. That training isn't working. Recently she broke down again and said she needed a total break from the dog and strongly hinted it was at the point where you choose her or the dog. You tried to give her a camping break. \n\nThat restful camping trip would still have involved a lot of work for her, even with you sharing the child caring load. And you couldn't even give her the whole trip - when the sitter couldn't cope, you brought the dog back with you to the trip whose whole purpose was to give your wife a break from it. I get that you needed to do something, but that was probably to stay home with the dog and let your wife have the full break. \n\nNow you also admit none of the kids are fans of the dog. Given how young kids tend to be with pets and parents, I suspect it's past not being fans. I suspect the dog annoys them, disrupts them, makes them worry about their mother, and they don't feel they can tell you all that (if they're even able to articulate it to themselves, which I doubt).\n\nYou need to choose. Your family's well-being or the dog who you may not be able to help anyway.", "YTA \n\nGet your head out of your asshole. You are literally about to lose your ENTIRE family over\u2026.. a dog. \n\nTime to make a choice: 1) surrender the dog, or 2) lose your wife and children, only seeing them a couple of days a week, and having to pay through the nose for child support/daycare/everything else. All for a dog.", "That is 100% what you should have done.\n\nWhere is your common sense or consideration for your wife at all.", "That\u2019s exactly what you should have done. You also should have told your wife what you were going to do. Instead, you snuck off using the excuse she was fishing so you could go get the dog because you knew she would be pissed. I\u2019m not saying you should have let dog be unattended, but you knew damn well that your family need a break and decided on your own to disregard your wife\u2019s health and feelings, yet again.\n\nYTA"]}
