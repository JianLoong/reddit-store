I hope you will have nice Christmas this year", "NTA- my kids are 32 and 29 and don't live at home.  I do my best to ensure that everyone is available for tree decorating. Including their girlfriends.", "NTA especially since they did it without you last year and you were upset last year too they should have learned their lesson not to do it without you Also i cant believe they did it  KNOWING THAT YOUR GOING THROUGH A LOSS, THAT TREE DECORATING/CHRISTMAS DECORATING IS IMPORTANT TO YOU AND THAT EVERYONE WOULD BE FREE THE NEXT DAY?! terrible NTA", "NTA. They knew it's important to you and they left you out. Also, my condolences for the loss of your pet.", "NTA - I encourage you to express how you feel to your family. \n\nKeep to just your feelings and don't go into what they should or shouldn't have done. It's a family activity you look forward to and you're disappointed and hurt that you were left out of it. \n\nDon't be surprised if they brush you off or dismiss you. But at least you can say you were honest about how you feel.", "NTA your mother KNEW you'd be upset. She also knew you were hurting and yet she \"can't be bothered\" to help you work through your emotions? Barf", "NTA, I'm a full grown adult and I would cry if my family decorated the tree without me. I'm sorry your family left you out.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nNo one I know (myself included) feels particularly strongly about decorating the tree.\n\nBut even in COLLEGE it was something we all did together (roommates, significant others, if you spent significant time there, you were included). We wouldn\u2019t have left anyone out, or would have asked first.\n\nAnd for us, it was just a fun group activity between a bunch of college kids, not an established family tradition.\n\nOf course you\u2019re NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re being treated poorly for having feelings about everything. That\u2019s not fair.", "Hmm I think NTA.\n\nIf this is important to you and you verbally expressed that it was then I think your family should've waited for you. But also, it sounds like you are all very busy so if you can try not to linger on it too long.", "NTA, but considering this has happened before you should have been more proactive about the situation. Asking \"Hey when are we putting up the tree this year?\"", "INFO- did your family know you'd be upset if they did this? Did you tell them? I'm guessing there would have been a conversation since putting up a tree as a family is a thing for you guys by the sounds of it?\n\nEdit: YTA. You said you did it as a family last year in the comments, but when someone said your family should have known better because they excluded you last time (I'm guessing that person got confused and that's why they thought this), you didn't even attempt to correct them. Just appreciated someone feeling sorry for you and agreeing with you.\n\nI think you're talking shit tbh.", "NTA Everyone is entitled to their feelings.  By the way feel free decorating my tree if you'd like.  You could put flyers out in the neighourhood and offer your services for a low cost of $20 to come and help decorate their trees.  Some people may be time poor, or others not as mobile and you'd get to decorate still and make a little money on the side.   Win win I'd say", "NTA for being upset, but at some stage you'll need to learn that not sulking when something doesn't happen as you expect is a life skill. You can explain that you're upset and why, but when someone comes to talk to you about it it's better for everyone if you engage. \n\nDid you even say you wanted to be involved with the tree?

Maybe remind Mommy that you won\u2019t be 16 forever, and you won\u2019t forget. Sorry about your pet.", "NTA.  Seems like they could have waited but just didn\u2019t think to (likely until it was too late).  Go out and get your own mini tree to decorate, it might make you feel better", "NTA at all. Your family sucks for leaving you out of such a special once a year tradition! Your mom can kick rocks in flip flops. She\u2019s the head asshole in this for sure. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry about Hedgeworth. Losing a pet/fur family member is the worst. I hope your week gets better.", "NTA. \n\nI have been collecting ornaments for my kids. And now their partners and my grandchildren. Each year I find one that reflects them, represents an accomplishment  or something that interests them. We label them and the lots get boxed individually by whose it is. Nobody wants their ornaments installed by a sibling. However, as impulsive preschoolers are, sometimes they \"help\", and it upsets the sibling whose ornaments got put up without them. I have gone back to remove the ornaments to allow the older child to have their ornament decorating opportunity becauseI know it is important to them. Your family failed to recognize their impact and mom went further to be dismissive and curt. \n\nHedgie Hedgworth will be missed and his hoomin is going to get through to the other side of this grief later. We all wish you didn't have to deal with this in this manner.", "NTA\n\n\nI am so very sorry for your loss. I hope you can find some space to truly allow yourself to grieve, as well as find some peace. The grief will come in waves--let yourself ride it, it's okay \u2764\ufe0f\n\nIf and when you're up to it, maybe take some time and decorate your room with a small personal tree and ornaments?", "thank you it was very hard for me but he's not in pain anymore. rip hedgeworth", "thank you", "thank you. I feel silly being upset about it but to me it seems like a nice reasonable thing to just do it tommorow? I don't see why they had to leave me out again", "Another comment, op said they did it as a family last year. Op is talking shit I feel.", "thank you", "thank you", "thank you. of course I know its just a tree but especially cuz of my little hedgehog passing it hurts extra hard", "Yeah, they know, it's happened before and I was really upset. I think that and the fact I want my family most rn due to loosing my buddy but felt like they let me down", "I thought i wouldnt have to because last year we did it as a family", "thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "yea she knew. we talked about putting up the tree a few weeks ago. except for one year where they did it without me and I was upset.\n\nShe knew I'd be upset so she didn't tell me until last minute", "Could've been a past year. Since OP specifically made a point of saying last year and not every year, I have a feeling there are times when she gets left out and last year just happened to be a good one.", "It\u2019s not just a tree, though. You were excluded from a fun activity which in and of itself is hurtful, but it\u2019s something you\u2019ve established means a lot to you.\n\nIt\u2019s just a tree in the same way my house is just a house or my kid is just a kid. But they\u2019re important to *me*. And this is important to you.\n\nThat\u2019s valid.", "I'm so sorry about your friend, and yeah thats not okay they did it without you. I hope you are all able to move forward and have a good Christmas together though <3", "Yeah, you know what? Sometimes Moms get tired of always being the \"cruise director\" for planning family stuff. So it's never a bad idea to get involved in the process, it shows that you're actually interested in what's going on.", "Your welcome.  Seriously put flyers in your neighbour letterboxes you never know, you might be swamped with requests.", "Yeah so as I said, it's OK to be upset and ok to tell her that. At 16 you're not an adult so you can act like a kid, but it's going to be better for everyone if you can talk it out.", "I find it odd that op didn't try and correct this comment. I think the person who wrote this comment misunderstood the \"previous years\" and assumed it was last year.", "Um OP is 16 not 26 and she made it clear that she wanted to be included. You don\u2019t have to be a cruise director to include all your kids in tree decorating.", "This! NTA for your feelings - but then take some ownership of the process and drive the process forward for your mom. She would probably appreciate not having to plan it all!", "\ud83d\ude02 I'd love that but I work and go to college (40hr week) but thats an idea. might give me more Christmas money lol"]}
