YTA for not immediately correcting yourself once you realised she\u2019d actually bought it.\n\nAlso, it might not be the best idea to make jokes about your SO\u2019s passions. And this might just be a me thing but I sense some derision in your wording about your wife\u2019s views and outlook on life, just sayin.", "INFO- when you say you make jokes about how she's really into feminism and about feminism in general, what are some literal examples of jokes you've made before this?", "YTA for the sexist way you even told this story.  My biggest takeaway is how dismissive you were of her mechanics recommendation to get rid of her old car.  Saying how you \"thought\" it had more years on it.  Let me tell you what buddy, speaking as a GAY MALE MECHANIC, this happens all the time.  And the fact that your wife's mechanic recommended that instead of using X amount of money to repair her old car, that she put those funds towards a new car speaks volumes.  It means her mechanic isn't taking her for a ride or being deceitful, rather looking out for her best outcome.  Being that you mentioned you use a different mechanic tells me your NOT automotive savvy, so that entire paragraph of you putting down her mechanic is irrelevant.  Let me rephrase what you wrote:\n\n\"I, as an untrained man, know more than a trained woman about my wife's car issues.\"\n\nMassive AH you are OP.", "I don't think the joke is the issue. YTA because you talk about your wife and how she makes choices like she's... so adorably silly. \"Look at the little women making little women choices.\" \n\nAs if men don't pick things for aesthetics? I know plenty of men who picked their cars for how they looked, the colour, etc. The amount of men at car shows spending thousands on little details is huge in my area.", "YTA\n\n\nYou should've revealed the joke. Also... you give \"I let my wife have her little hobbys\" vibes.", "YTA. Your wife needs to improve her knowledge on investing in and caring for a motor vehicle. However, I felt all kinds of underlying misogyny in your post (re: the mechanic, bought it \u201cfrom a lady\u201d, association of women drivers). Like just stop and be helpful to your partner.", "YTA. Not so much for the one joke... but for the ongoing jokes. Even when we know someone is joking, their words have a cumulative effect that is very real. Why do you feel the need to belittle your wife?", "YTA. You don't actually seem to respect your wife.", "You seem insecure. Are you a little preoccupied with the fact that your wife id's as a feminist and supports women who work in nontraditional fields? Your dismissal of her mechanic, claiming your wife only likes her because of her gender? Is classic bullshit designed to make it impossible for this person to be evaluated on the merits of her work. You have work to do. I hope she leaves you and marries a fellow feminist. Or someone at least a bit more secure. YTA.", "Are you an AH for the prank?  As a standalone event, no. \n\nAre you an AH per the red herring details added as context, depicting how you belittle your gf as a feminist?  If the shoe fits.", "YTA - for your judgmental sexism in this post.", "Condescending jokes, YTA.", "Sigh. Yawn. YTA", "YTA. Sexist jokes perpetuate sexism. You\u2019re part of the problem.", "YTA. Your joke was sexist. It\u2019s not funny unless she, the person you\u2019re telling your HAHAHA SO FUNNY joke to, also laughs. \n\nFYI: Your wife isn\u2019t \u201cinto feminism.\u201d She\u2019s just simply a feminist.", "YTA man. She's your wife, and the way you handled the situation is pretty disrespectful", "Wow. YTA. Not specifically for making that joke, but because it sounds like you are, in fact, being misogynistic and disrespectful of your wife. \n\nYou \\[I am assuming because you never mentioned it\\] are not a mechanic, yet felt your opinion on the functionality of her car to be better than that of her mechanic's. \\[if she went for a second female mechanic's opinion, would you have been more convinced?\\] I doubt your wife would keep going to a bad mechanic just because she was a woman, so she must have been fixing the car right up to that point. So, I see no reason for you to doubt her judgment now. \\[It's not as if the mechanic makes money telling your wife to buy a new car. If she wanted to do that, she wouldn't have told her about the bad engine so your wife would've had to keep coming in instead. \"there's more profit in treating a disease than curing it\"\\]\n\nThen the comment about how she bought a car because it \"looked cute\" seeming odd to you. Not everyone knows about cars, but a lot of people need them and, hence, buy them. Maybe she could have asked more questions about the car itself if that's your concern, but there is nothing wrong with buying a car just because you like it \\[ a lot of people I know, men AND women have done this\\]. That comment feels like you are undercutting her a little like her choice was somehow a ditzy move. Also, why is the gender of the person she bought it from relevant at all unless you are trying to emphasize your wife's feminism? Would she have refused to buy a car from a man?\n\nYou also mentioned at the beginning how you often make fun of her feminism. I am not your wife, so I cannot speak to this, but it seems like this is less about the joke itself \\[which itself seems like a stab at her due to you exploiting her ignorance in something for your own amusement\\] and more about the fact that you KEEP making these jokes. This is her life and her beliefs. I wouldn't be happy if somebody was always finding a chance to mock my beliefs either.\n\nYou should be more considerate of your wife. Whether you mean to be or not, it sounds like you are being hurtful and disrespectful of her. And yes, a little misogynistic for the above-listed reasons. I think you should have a serious talk with your wife about why she is so upset and really LISTEN to her when she tells you why. If these \"jokes\" are actually hurtful to her then you shouldn't make them anymore. Because, at that point, it isn't a joke anymore, it's verbal abuse.", "YTA, and a condescending one at that. Would you be talking about her getting a second opinion if her mechanic was a man? \n\nAlso, if it's a joke, what exactly is funny about it? You'll have to explain it to me, because I don't get it.\n\nUnless, of course, you think it's funny to make jokes at your wife's expense.", "YTA and I could tell from the opening line where you said you make jokes about feminism often. Your wife isn't into feminism because it's a hobby. Its a movement. I'm a feminist. And I'm a feminist because I'm in my mid 30s and I see and experience that the world is still not equal. Still every day I have to deal with people like you who deep down inside believe we are silly little women and that you probably know better. You need to check yourself and your male privilege and understand that being a woman and wanting equality isn't even really a choice for most women, it's just something we have to do. However, some women are more involved than others in the fight for equality.\n\nIf you were dating a women of colour, would you say jokingly that she's into anti-racism? Or would you just understand that racism still exists and that she would always be in the fight against racism in order to achieve her own equality in life? Would you make fun of her for her fight against racists?\n\nTrying to achieve equality in a world where you have traits that you're discriminated for daily isn't a laughing matter. You shouldn't make light fun of her and if you do, just realise you're actually part of the wider problem because actually, only an AH thinks it's jokes to make fun of someone fighting for equality.", "YTA and you absolutely are sexist.", "YTA for letting her believe it once you realized she thought it was real.", "Dick.

Even if you're not savvy with vehicles or vehicle lingo, it's your responsibility man, or woman to ask questions and know what you're buying. I work in a male-dominated field, so I've developed a thick skin, and friendly ribbing is just part of the gig, but it does drive me to do better, and educate myself about thing I'm unfamiliar with regardless of sex. I don't see the problem with a simple harmless joke, but if the jokes are a constant thing this may have been the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nIf OP truly wants his wife to be equal he would learn to tactfully teach and advise his wife without mansplaining. Show her how to do her own research, or how to determine what's important in purchasing a vehicle, based on her needs. And this goes for anything else she may struggle or be unfamilair with. In a relationship, you're supposed to help and encourage your partner be the best they can be.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with poking fun at feminism if you truly do believe in equality. My wife (27) used to get upset about it but I\u2019d only make the jokes when her views were going past equality and into pushing men below. Luckily, she realized this early on and that I had no ill intent with my jokes, just pointing out small truths through comedy. No need to search for a woman mechanic, just find the best mechanic. This isn\u2019t an anti woman mechanic thought though, for instance, I only book appointments with the one woman at my barbershop because I think she\u2019s does a better fade than the other 7 barbers.", "NTA.

Your wife *is a feminist*.\n\n>I often joke about it and she does not seem to mind\n\nOh she minds you just don't *seem* to care.\n\n>Like I believe in equality and all and don't criticize her view or anything.\n\nOh yeah? *Like totally for sure man.  Totally believe in equality man.*  That's what you sound like, which is less than convincing.  And by the way, constantly making jokes about her \"being into feminism\" is in fact criticism.  So yes, you *do* criticize her views.\n\n>My wife was having car troubles with the engine of her old car\n\n>her mechanic convinced her they were going to get worse and advised her to get another car.\n\nWhy did you use the word \"convince\" here instead of something like \"told\" or \"informed\"?  Is it because you inherently view all women as stereotypical gossip machines who only know how to manipulate and not inform? *Probably*.\n\n>Her mechanic is actually a woman \n\nWomen actually have brains.  Women can actually be mechanics.  Women can *actually* learn anything a man can learn because there are no differences whatsoever in the intelligence or innate learning abilities between male and female counterparts as a whole.\n\n>she trusts her for that reason\n\nSo she trusts her mechanic bc she's a woman or because she's a trained professional who knows what she's talking about?  I'm betting it's the latter.  \n\n>She bought it because she 'fell in love with the color' and thought it 'looked cute'.\n\n>seemed like an odd reason to get a car to me.\n\nHow is it an odd reason?  Let's recap: your wife was having engine troubles with her car, her mechanic advised her the issue will get worse and the car will need to be replaced, your wife found a car she loves and got it rather than wait to be broken down on the side of the road with a car that wasn't running right.  But you think it's odd? Or are you just being overly critical because you aren't the one calling the shots here and you are *always* overly critical of your wife and don't trust her to make her own decisions as a grown adult?\n\n>I thought she would realize it was a joke but she took me seriously so I didn't say anything and tried not to laugh.\n\nThis is the moment.  This is when you should have immediately corrected yourself.  Why perpetuate the \"joke\"?  When a joke has been taken as fact, accidentally or not, it becomes a *lie*.  You *lied* to your wife.\n\n>. I don't get why she is so offended by such a small joke as I would have told her eventually\n\nAnother perfect example of why you're an AH.  You'd rather literally lie to your wife and have her hanging onto your every word where you and you alone control the source and timing of the information and you completely disregard her emotions *entirely* and your only basis for doing so is your opinion.  You don't deserve your wife.\n\n***YTA***", "Important things to note: \u201cmechanic is a woman and she trusts her for that reason.\u201d If that\u2019s solely the reason she trusted her to make a big decision, then yes, I think it\u2019s fine if he has a bit of an issue there. Trusting a male mechanic for no other reason than him being a man can lead to being taken advantage of just the same as with a woman. \n\nJudging by the fact that the wife doesn\u2019t know what AWD stands for, on a vehicle she just bought for at least a few thousand dollars, and with no input from her husband, sounds like there may be an issue accepting her husband\u2019s opinions. Contrary to what a lot of the people here are saying, you need to do more research on your vehicle than color and styling. Reliability, features, and warranty are all substantially more important than the paint job. \n\nKnowing his wife, OP thought the joke would work. I thought it was reasonably funny for a throwaway joke. He didn\u2019t say it in front of other people, he didn\u2019t have her repeat it to all her friends, it sounds like he made the joke in the car, they got home, and she tried to look up the \u201cassociation.\u201d  On a scale of embarrassing jokes, that\u2019s pretty darn low. My wife pokes fun at me for not knowing the differences in  some colors or for not knowing some basics of some of her hobbies, and I\u2019ll poke fun about my hobbies. We don\u2019t take it to heart, she knows more about some things and I know more about other things. \n\nFinally, yes you could\u2019ve worked on that first line. I think there are varying levels of feminism and masculinity. If taken too far, both can become toxic. Personally, I just don\u2019t treat people as less than and that suits me well. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a misogynist and if what you wrote is all true, it sounds like you caught your wife on a bad day. No biggie, you\u2019re married, this is a blip on the radar.

And I absolutely hate that\u2019s it\u2019s been coined like its some sort of cult with bad vibes and terms rolling around like \u201cfeminazi\u201d. Feminism is about women\u2019s RIGHTS. All feminism is, is woman saying we want to be treated EQUALLY to men, we want to be paid the same as a man would when we do the same amount of work, we want to be hired the same as a man would with the same resume, we want to not be subjected to sexual harassment, or belittlement due to our gender, or talked down to for not having kids, or judged for being a working mom instead of a SAHM. We want men to stop policing our bodies. We didn\u2019t even always have the right to VOTE. We just want the same rights men have always just had handed to them. It\u2019s not something \u201cwe\u2019re into\u201d it\u2019s an inherent right that we has been kept from us to keep us submissive to men because that\u2019s how they like it.\n\n>\tI often joke about it\n\nOften?

I honestly don\u2019t see how it\u2019s relevant. She chose a woman mechanic most likely because she was tired of male mechanics taking advantage of her lack of car knowledge and driving up prices or listing off repairs she didn\u2019t actually need. I know first hand how often this happens as now when I take my car in, I get the quotes by myself and then I bring my husband in and he starts breaking them down with them. They ALWAYS start back tracking and being way more honest about the \u201cshelf life\u201d of things (like my breaks for example) when suddenly my husband is there asking them questions with the knowledge to gauge their answers.

I've walked out of multiple dealerships because the salesperson only talks to my husband. I'd understand if I didn't make it clear that I'm the buyer, but I feel like when I lead with \"Hi, I'm [name], the one who called about X car, here's my license and insurance for the test drive I scheduled\", it's pretty obvious.

She's more likely to die.  The seatbelt is less likely to be in the right place, and she's more likely too close to the airbags because she has to be pushed up to be closer to the pedals.   Cars are only tested with the male crash test dummy in the driver's seat.  The female test dummy is very small, about 5 feet and 110 pounds (not exact numbers, but close), and is only tested in the passenger seat."]}
