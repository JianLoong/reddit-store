YTA for not immediately correcting yourself once you realised she\u2019d actually bought it.\n\nAlso, it might not be the best idea to make jokes about your SO\u2019s passions. And this might just be a me thing but I sense some derision in your wording about your wife\u2019s views and outlook on life, just sayin.", "INFO- when you say you make jokes about how she's really into feminism and about feminism in general, what are some literal examples of jokes you've made before this?", "YTA for the sexist way you even told this story.  My biggest takeaway is how dismissive you were of her mechanics recommendation to get rid of her old car.  Saying how you \"thought\" it had more years on it.  Let me tell you what buddy, speaking as a GAY MALE MECHANIC, this happens all the time.  And the fact that your wife's mechanic recommended that instead of using X amount of money to repair her old car, that she put those funds towards a new car speaks volumes.  It means her mechanic isn't taking her for a ride or being deceitful, rather looking out for her best outcome.  Being that you mentioned you use a different mechanic tells me your NOT automotive savvy, so that entire paragraph of you putting down her mechanic is irrelevant.  Let me rephrase what you wrote:\n\n\"I, as an untrained man, know more than a trained woman about my wife's car issues.\"\n\nMassive AH you are OP.", "I don't think the joke is the issue. YTA because you talk about your wife and how she makes choices like she's... so adorably silly. \"Look at the little women making little women choices.\" \n\nAs if men don't pick things for aesthetics? I know plenty of men who picked their cars for how they looked, the colour, etc. The amount of men at car shows spending thousands on little details is huge in my area.", "YTA\n\n\nYou should've revealed the joke. Also... you give \"I let my wife have her little hobbys\" vibes.", "YTA. Your wife needs to improve her knowledge on investing in and caring for a motor vehicle. However, I felt all kinds of underlying misogyny in your post (re: the mechanic, bought it \u201cfrom a lady\u201d, association of women drivers). Like just stop and be helpful to your partner.", "YTA. Not so much for the one joke... but for the ongoing jokes. Even when we know someone is joking, their words have a cumulative effect that is very real. Why do you feel the need to belittle your wife?", "YTA. You don't actually seem to respect your wife.", "You seem insecure. Are you a little preoccupied with the fact that your wife id's as a feminist and supports women who work in nontraditional fields? Your dismissal of her mechanic, claiming your wife only likes her because of her gender? Is classic bullshit designed to make it impossible for this person to be evaluated on the merits of her work. You have work to do. I hope she leaves you and marries a fellow feminist. Or someone at least a bit more secure. YTA.", "Are you an AH for the prank?  As a standalone event, no. \n\nAre you an AH per the red herring details added as context, depicting how you belittle your gf as a feminist?  If the shoe fits.", "YTA - for your judgmental sexism in this post.", "Condescending jokes, YTA.", "Sigh. Yawn. YTA", "YTA. Sexist jokes perpetuate sexism. You\u2019re part of the problem.", "YTA. Your joke was sexist. It\u2019s not funny unless she, the person you\u2019re telling your HAHAHA SO FUNNY joke to, also laughs. \n\nFYI: Your wife isn\u2019t \u201cinto feminism.\u201d She\u2019s just simply a feminist.", "YTA man. She's your wife, and the way you handled the situation is pretty disrespectful", "Wow. YTA. Not specifically for making that joke, but because it sounds like you are, in fact, being misogynistic and disrespectful of your wife. \n\nYou \\[I am assuming because you never mentioned it\\] are not a mechanic, yet felt your opinion on the functionality of her car to be better than that of her mechanic's. \\[if she went for a second female mechanic's opinion, would you have been more convinced?\\] I doubt your wife would keep going to a bad mechanic just because she was a woman, so she must have been fixing the car right up to that point. So, I see no reason for you to doubt her judgment now. \\[It's not as if the mechanic makes money telling your wife to buy a new car. If she wanted to do that, she wouldn't have told her about the bad engine so your wife would've had to keep coming in instead. \"there's more profit in treating a disease than curing it\"\\]\n\nThen the comment about how she bought a car because it \"looked cute\" seeming odd to you. Not everyone knows about cars, but a lot of people need them and, hence, buy them. Maybe she could have asked more questions about the car itself if that's your concern, but there is nothing wrong with buying a car just because you like it \\[ a lot of people I know, men AND women have done this\\]. That comment feels like you are undercutting her a little like her choice was somehow a ditzy move. Also, why is the gender of the person she bought it from relevant at all unless you are trying to emphasize your wife's feminism? Would she have refused to buy a car from a man?\n\nYou also mentioned at the beginning how you often make fun of her feminism. I am not your wife, so I cannot speak to this, but it seems like this is less about the joke itself \\[which itself seems like a stab at her due to you exploiting her ignorance in something for your own amusement\\] and more about the fact that you KEEP making these jokes. This is her life and her beliefs. I wouldn't be happy if somebody was always finding a chance to mock my beliefs either.\n\nYou should be more considerate of your wife. Whether you mean to be or not, it sounds like you are being hurtful and disrespectful of her. And yes, a little misogynistic for the above-listed reasons. I think you should have a serious talk with your wife about why she is so upset and really LISTEN to her when she tells you why. If these \"jokes\" are actually hurtful to her then you shouldn't make them anymore. Because, at that point, it isn't a joke anymore, it's verbal abuse.", "YTA, and a condescending one at that. Would you be talking about her getting a second opinion if her mechanic was a man? \n\nAlso, if it's a joke, what exactly is funny about it? You'll have to explain it to me, because I don't get it.\n\nUnless, of course, you think it's funny to make jokes at your wife's expense.", "YTA and I could tell from the opening line where you said you make jokes about feminism often. Your wife isn't into feminism because it's a hobby. Its a movement. I'm a feminist. And I'm a feminist because I'm in my mid 30s and I see and experience that the world is still not equal. Still every day I have to deal with people like you who deep down inside believe we are silly little women and that you probably know better. You need to check yourself and your male privilege and understand that being a woman and wanting equality isn't even really a choice for most women, it's just something we have to do. However, some women are more involved than others in the fight for equality.\n\nIf you were dating a women of colour, would you say jokingly that she's into anti-racism? Or would you just understand that racism still exists and that she would always be in the fight against racism in order to achieve her own equality in life? Would you make fun of her for her fight against racists?\n\nTrying to achieve equality in a world where you have traits that you're discriminated for daily isn't a laughing matter. You shouldn't make light fun of her and if you do, just realise you're actually part of the wider problem because actually, only an AH thinks it's jokes to make fun of someone fighting for equality.", "YTA and you absolutely are sexist.", "YTA for letting her believe it once you realized she thought it was real.", "Dick.
