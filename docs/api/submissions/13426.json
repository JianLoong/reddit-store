{"id": 13426, "submission_id": "124yiqj", "title": "AITA for asking to have coffee with another man.", "selftext": "I (40f) have been married to my husband (45m) for 17 years. Recently I\u2019ve gotten into fitness, tracking macros, lifting weights etc.  I really enjoy it and want to really make some gains so a few months ago I got with a personal trainer \n(edit who is also a man who was recommended on my community page and who I picked b/c he was cheaper than in person trainers and had good references. My husband wanted to see a picture of him and told me I should have gotten a female trainer. Also, I pay for the trainer myself.)\n\nIt\u2019s all online but the trainer gives me a scheduled workout and nutrition plan. When I told my husband about the trainer he was really really upset. I calmed down a little but there\u2019s been some tension anytime I mention fitness or working out. Because of my training plan I\u2019ve been going to the gym almost daily.  A few weeks ago a guy approached me and we started talking.  We like similar activities (hiking, sports, etc) and have similar perspectives and outlooks on life. He is significantly younger than me (30) so, it\u2019s more like a brother/sister relationship, at least to me. Yesterday he mentioned going to grab coffee and I said \u201ccool, just need to check with my husband.\u201d I was nervous to ask him so I guess I should have just said no but I really thought it was ok to just hang out with a guy that\u2019s a friend.  As it turns out, my husband is not ok, he\u2019s furious that I would even ask him. He said the only reason men talk to me or are interested in me is because they want to hook up. I don\u2019t know why anyone would want to hook up with a 40yr old woman who has had 3 kids and I really wasn\u2019t getting that vibe from the gym bro. I thought it was friendly coffee but my husband says I\u2019m naive.  So, AITA?\n\nETA: Several people have mentioned that I would not be comfortable with my husband hanging out with a younger fitter girl so I just wanted to address that.  I\u2019m a big believer in gender equality so the first thing I considered was, would I be cool if my husband did this.  I trust him completely, we\u2019ve been through a lot together (not trust wise) and I feel like he knows me better than anyone. I always tell him how lucky I am to be married to him and say I love you everyday. If you asked me (before all this) which couple in our friend group had the strongest relationship I would have said us. \n\nAlso, I know several of the women that he works with are younger and hotter than me.  If he worked in an office and said he was grabbing coffee with one of them I wouldn\u2019t bat an eye because no matter their intentions, I know he would never do anything to hurt me.  I honestly feel bad that my actions have hurt him so much but I\u2019m frustrated b/c I really didn\u2019t think grabbing coffee with a friend was such a big deal. I want to be able to have an identity that\u2019s not mom or teacher. \n\nI just figured, it\u2019s a hobby so people with hobbies hang out with other people with the same hobbies. He hangs out with his comic book friends, if there were younger hotter women involved in that I still wouldn\u2019t mind if they hung out. I don\u2019t like talking about comic books anymore than he likes talking about fitness.\n\nEdit 2: Y\u2019all I really didn\u2019t think it was a date but I\u2019m willing to admit I\u2019m naive. I don\u2019t usually get hit on (that I know of) and I haven\u2019t been on a date since I was 19 (other than with my husband). I honestly did not realize people had affairs at the gym. No one I know is a gym rat except my \u201cfriend\u201d who I guess, from reading the comments, was just thinking statistically he had a chance.  I\u2019ll just shut that down next time I see him and change my workout schedules and keep to myself from now on. I thought the gym was a fun, friendly atmosphere where people help each other out but perhaps that\u2019s just guys helping other guys.

We're still good friends and he's never made a move on me because he respects my boundaries and knows I'm married. His feelings are on him, and if he can't handle them then he can choose to end the friendship. A similar thing happened with my husband as well.\n\nBut guess what? My husband nor I ever freaked out over this and put limitations on our relationship, because we TRUST each other. If you can't trust your partner then why the hell are you married? \n\nI'm tired of this narrative that it's on woman to deal with men wanting to be more than friends (or even men to deal with woman who want to be more then friends).

So, you are just responsible for making sure that potential friends know you are only open to founding platonic relationships. \n\nIt sounds like your husband has real jealousy issues and/or has particular jealousy surrounding your new interest in fitness, and that is a real red flag worth exploring more with him before it blows up.", "NTA you made it clear you have a husband, you are allowed to make friends.

Regardless of the intentions of the gym bro, you were not going on a date, you were going to chat and drink coffee, and no doubt would shut it down if he tried to get with you. He has no right to police your friendships outside of truly egregious cases (like that person being unsafe or a total dick to you/him) and his anger that you would even dare to ask is seriously messed up. He is insecure, possibly because you are getting into shape and maybe he's not? Y'all need to have a talk about this!

But also it could really just be a friendship thing!\n\nYour husband being a little frustrated and jealous because he thinks the guy is asking you out isn't totally unfair, IMO. I can see where he's coming from.

But I think you had an inkling that this guy was interested in you, otherwise you wouldn't have told him you need to ask your husband.\n\nFor the record, it's really not that crazy to think a 30 year old dude would be interested in a 40 year old woman, especially if he doesn't know she's married.

Cos I legit, honestly, believe people can go get coffee without it meaning anything else!

Milf categories are popular on porn hub for a reason. \n\nI don\u2019t think most men would appreciate your wife, getting coffee with a younger man who they met at the gym. Because it makes him feel inferior. It\u2019s basically like I\u2019m going to hang out with a younger and hotter guy. But it\u2019s not like you try to do it in secret. \n\nI think we need to know more about the dynamic between you and your husband to fully assess the situation. Because if he\u2019s a perfectly rational, good man, you should be able to talk to him about this and present your point of you. I even think there\u2019s a happy middle ground. Such as if you go to a gym that\u2019s next to a Starbucks and have coffee before class as you\u2019re walking to the gym. I have done this with my personal trainer before. I\u2019ve made lots of connections with personal trainers, and in no way, shape or form wasn\u2019t ever sexual. But I do think that people associate gyms with hot sweaty people in tight clothing sooo that difficult for someone like your husband to unpack\n\nBut if you tell us with a dynamic between you and your husband is already Rocky. And then he suffers from Milfred jewelry then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being an asshole. I just think you\u2019re with someone who is insecure we probably shouldn\u2019t be with. \n\nBut overall, I think you should try to find a middle ground. Is there perhaps like a running group that you could meet with. Or CrossFit gym. If you are needing that little extra dose of social ability, perhaps try doing it in a group setting, because small boutique size  gyms  often have social gatherings.

Often we mention that we may change as people throughout our lives.

Along with, letting them know I crave more intimacy with some friends. They will often tell me they miss a friend, but might want to hang with them on their own first, before including me. (That\u2019s just because we are pretty close friends as is, and so we often want to hang out together- specifically because there isn\u2019t any time in the day as is!)\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026 it\u2019s scary to talk to your partner about friends, new people, and even things more taboo as extramarital affairs.

Ask what he would do if his comic buddies vanished. I\u2019m sure if you two are close, you would be enough for him at first. But we are human, and we crave connection.

If this is based on worldview and it's such an evenly split one, I don't think there's a single moral judgment that can be made. \n\nThis also means that every couple needs to figure this out for themselves. They need to be upfront, establish their boundaries early in the relationship, and reassess as needed. OP, your husband wanting you to avoid independent friendships with someone of the opposite sex is a position you need to consider. Are you okay with him setting that boundary? Is there a compromise you could make? You need to talk about these things and try to keep it from becoming accusatory or defensive. You should talk about why he has a problem with it and why you a) thought you should ask his permission in the first place and b) thought going with your new friend wouldn't be an issue. If you can't come to a resolution you both are satisfied with, counseling might be in order. \n\n\nMy original thoughts, and I still think this is how *I* would feel in the situation and would demand counseling immediately: Your husband is controlling and excessively jealous. What even IS his problem with the virtual trainer? But as to the friend from the gym, the fact that you even felt like you had to ask is a red flag.

Obviously there are exceptions and some people are just friends but you've only just met this man a few weeks ago, I don't think any kind of true brother/sister bond could have been formed in that short time frame.

Recently I\u2019ve gotten into fitness, tracking macros, lifting weights etc.  I really enjoy it and want to really make some gains so a few months ago I got with a personal trainer.  It\u2019s all online but the trainer gives me a scheduled workout and nutrition plan. When I told my husband about the trainer he was really really upset. I calmed down a little but there\u2019s been some tension anytime I mention fitness or working out. Because of my training plan I\u2019ve been going to the gym almost daily.  A few weeks ago a guy approached me and we started talking.  We like similar activities (hiking, sports, etc) and have similar perspectives and outlooks on life. He is significantly younger than me (30) so, it\u2019s more like a brother/sister relationship, at least to me. Yesterday he mentioned going to grab coffee and I said \u201ccool, just need to check with my husband.\u201d I was nervous to ask him so I guess I should have just said no but I really thought it was ok to just hang out with a guy that\u2019s a friend.  As it turns out, my husband is not ok, he\u2019s furious that I would even ask him. He said the only reason men talk to me or are interested in me is because they want to hook up. I don\u2019t know why anyone would want to hook up with a 40yr old woman whose had 3 kids and I really wasn\u2019t getting that vibe from the gym bro. I thought it was friendly coffee but my husband says I\u2019m naive.  So, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As long as you make it clear to the dude it\u2019s just a friendship then it should be FINE. \n\nI think it\u2019s so important for people to have friends with similar interests.

Super disturbing.", "^^^ Yep, very few people intentionally set out to have an affair. It's something innocuous, just a friend who happens to have so much in common, and the connection feels so effortless, and spending time with them is so exciting, and it's flattering to feel wanted, and then whoopsies they slipped & fell on a *something*.", "She told the guy she was checking with her husband. That sounds like a clue that she\u2019s not looking to date.", "I replied to an earlier comment, but this is how I view it:\n\nThis is tricky. \n\nIf you're meeting over your break/lunch at work, it's fine. It's a work thing with a set time limit; it's not intimate. If, however, you're invited to do so on a day off, it steps into the territory of intimate, and you are then subject to entering AH territory.  \n\nAs is the case for most adults, your social circle is mostly limited to your work relations or clubs/teams. And to give context to why the latter scenario I listed steps you into AH territory, you pretty much need to justify to your partner (and yourself) why you want to meet said person on your day off; why seeing them every day at work/club isn't enough. You basically have to explain why you want to give up time on your day off together to spend with another man/woman.\n\nAt the end of the day, most couples won't do it, even if there's nothing there. Why? Because doing so can cause distress for your partner. No matter how good the work friend may be, they should still come second to your partners feelings. And if you feel like you really want to do it to the point you'll do it in secret, then you have a much, much bigger problem on your hands. And if said friend is pushing you to do it, then there's a good likelihood that said friend may have feelings for you. Why do I say that? Because they are asking you to meet up in a private setting, knowing full well you're in a relationship. Common decency generally discourages that.", "Not true but your partner needs to be ok with it", ">You basically have to explain why you want to give up time on your day off together to spend with another man/woman.\n\nThis statement is a really unhealthy and controlling view. Couples do not have to spend all of their free time together. People need to be able to spend time with their friends without that time being viewed as time they should have been with their partner.", "You\u2019re right. Misandrist to disallow your husband to make friends, misogynistic to view his female friends differently than his male lol", "She doesn't even know the guy.", "Honestly married women are sort of known to be relatively easy marks at places like night clubs (I realize this a gym).  Basically once they stray to a place where single people are they are sort of putting out the green light while pretending they have no idea.\n\n*\"Oh you know me, I would never think of cheating, but then I started talking to him and it got me thinking...\"*", "My parents met at church, also a \"well known place for starting dates and hookups.\"\n\nPeople CAN have the same outlook and perspective, that's not always code for fucking.\n\nA gym is a public place where people go to exercise. That's all.  Most people in society can keep their minds to themselves, even if you can't.", "Yah. I got red flags on the husband the second j read that he wanted to see photos of the online trainer and said OP should have hired a female trainer.", "I think very people who have an affair admit they did it intentionally.  With that said, they just happened to end up having coffee with the attractive person... but not intentionally of course.", "Oh please, you must be fucking delusional to think a guy would approach a random woman at the gym and ask for coffee because he wanted to be just friends", "This is comical. Sometimes, when we have friends, we don\u2019t want our hang out sesh to be bound by a 30 minute lunch break or something like that. It bums me out when I\u2019m chilling with a friend and the visit has to be cut short unnaturally for some reason. That is one of several reasons someone could potentially want to see a friend on an off day. \n\nDo you think that every single moment spent outside of work or clubs should be spent with one\u2019s spouse? That\u2019s how it kind of sounds when you say OP may be \u201cgiving up time with her spouse to spend with another man/woman\u201d. \n\nGym bro asked to meet in a coffee shop, which is public\u2026not his apartment or a hotel room, which would be private. \n\nYour outlook, along with most of what I see on this thread, is full of incredibly unhealthy relationship ideas. \n\nMaybe OP is being slightly naive (though I don\u2019t see that) but that doesn\u2019t make her unfaithful or disloyal. Another persons intentions don\u2019t determine how we respond. If you\u2019re that impressionable then you have other problems. \n\nTbh?? Her husband belongs on this thread for real. Immediately needing to see a photo of the online trainer and saying she should have hired a female instead is textbook insecurity.", "Your partner needs to be ok with you hanging out with a friend of the opposite sex? Absolutely not. I guess, in the broader sense of, you need to find someone who won't try and put that unreasonable limit on you - but as a default state, no, your partner should not have ANY issues with you hanging out 1-1 with someone of the opposite sex. So long as there are no other behavioural factors that indicate cheating, you should have more trust in your partner than that, and if you don't, you should just break up.", "Well yeah, how would she if she\u2019s trying to meet new friends? Also it sounds like they\u2018ve chatted a few times already and gotten along alright", "Is just really naive to think a young guy would approach a random woman at the gym looking for a friend, it mayyyyyy happens, but as adults we know most of the times the guys have other intentions", "I didn't say it was code for fucking. \n\nAnd what do you mean keep my mind to myself? OP requested a judgment. I'm not going to local gyms and telling people what I think they should do.", "There was a study done about this a few years ago, I believe. The study found that while men in Affairs generally go out of their way to have an affair and intentionally look for it, women do not. Women tend to start their affairs as just friends and with the intention of being friends.", "But weren't they already friends? Or friendly at least. I'll go back and reread it but it seems like they talk at the gym and he asked to hang out outside the gym after already knowing each other. And, sure, that sounds like he's interested, don't get me wrong but I don't think (?) that he just walked up to her randomly and asked her out if that makes sense.", "It would never occur to me to ask my husband if I could get a cup of coffee with literally anyone.", "So now it sounds like you\u2019re trying to gate keep what your husband is allowed to talk about with other women. And discussing \u201coutlook and perspective\u201d with friends sounds incredible! What about that makes you uncomfortable in the context of your relationship?", "Yeah he's a guy he wants to bang her. I'm a guy too, I know what's in his mind. That being said I don't think she's an asshole, I just don't think her husband is either. 17 years married, he can have an opinion on his wife's behaviour, as she can his, without resorting to one word descriptors. You understand?", "she made it clear she\u2019s married though, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to let anything happen. if he tries something she can tell him to fuck off. if he doesn\u2019t, he wanted to be friends. what\u2019s the harm in going for coffee? it\u2019s not like if the guy expresses interest when they\u2019re out for coffee she\u2019d suddenly be in his bed lol. what\u2019s the harm in giving him the benefit of the doubt and hoping he\u2019s serious about a friendship?\n\nthis just bugs me because i\u2019m in my 30s and have had partners get upset for this same thing when i\u2019m just friendly and happen to be friends with guys. it\u2019s ok to be friends with the opposite sex. i\u2019ve had guys say they want friendship and really want something else, and i just stop hanging with them when i find it out or just say no\u2026it\u2019s really not a big deal.", "No, worse, you're going to the husbands and wives of people who go to gyms and telling them not to trust their spouses. It's gross. It's also validating a lot of really gross assumptions that lead to shit like domestic abuse.", "I think women like to couch situations where they can plausibly suggest they didn't mastermind it and it just happened.  That they were victims of circumstance.\n\n*You know, I'm a good person, I would never have sought this out.*", "If they were friendly in the gym, inviting her to coffee is escalating the \"friendship\".", "Yes I feel like I've wandered into a thread filled with people who have not had the most healthy relationships or know what trust really is.", "I doubt the trainer is gonna bang her at the very public coffee shop", "Maybe some guys only want that, but definitely not all. I wouldn\u2019t even count on most only caring about that. In this story I don\u2019t think we know enough about the dude to be able to tell what his intentions were. And sure her husband is allowed to have his opinions, but to get furious at her for even asking to meet with someone she was hoping to form a friendship with sounds pretty assholish and over the top to me. To be honest, the fact that he apparently feels he has the right to forbid her from meeting up with anyone seems strange and controlling to me. Also kinda misogynistic to act like the only reason men would even wanna talk to her is to sleep with her", "She making clear shes married doesnt really change much for some people and although she can tell him to fuck off, this doesn't change her naiviness, also lets be realistic again,yes you can have male friends, but do you think a guy 10ys younger than her who never saw her before looked at her at the gym and thought \"yep, im gonna be friends with her\"    I mean common....", "And what does making it clear she's married do exactly?  You don't think married women cheat?", "Is it? My best friend and I are both bi and we go out all the time, our friendship has gotten stronger but has never \"escalated\" Men and women can be just friends. Even married people.", "Wow so funny", "You sound like you have no idea what misogyny is. Hatred of women equates to average guy being interested in sex with women? What are you even talking about? Any original thoughts dude? It's the guys wife, she can't meet 30 year old guys, he can't meet 30 year old women, easy enough or no? Name ONE woman okay with her 40s 17 year husband hanging out with 30 year women. And not yourself or some woman you're about to make up.", "He obviously thought, wow she's pretty.  I have a lot in common with pretty women, we should be friends.", "Yeah if there's not sexual attraction, I agree.  For attractive people it's different.\n\nSome people are physically attractive but have a terrible personality, in that case there's no friend ship.\n\nSome people are not attractive, but have a great personality and you can enjoy their personality as friends, but feel no attraction.\n\nBut when you go to 'Is physically attractive and has great personality..' there's no plausible 'Yeah but I wouldn't we are just friends'.", "No it\u2018s about the fact that he\u2019s saying that men could only be interested in her sexually as if she isn\u2019t good for anything else. \nWhy shouldn\u2019t she get to meet up with whoever she wants? If she wanted to cheat she wouldn\u2019t tell him anyways and him acting so insecure about her spending time with anyone of the opposite sex is just unreasonable. Again, if you don\u2019t trust your partner, then why are you with them? Also why does their age even matter? It seems pretty clear that she isn\u2019t interested in the dude either way", "Surely, common gym bro behaviour", "What. \n\nDid you just call me ugly? \n\nOp said nothing about finding the guy attractive", "They're married 17 years he can think what he wants about unknown 30 year old men regardless of what you and the losers downvoting me think. If you look at op's edit you'll see she came to her senses.", "Seeing her awkwardly use a machine.... *'Oh that looks like a great exercise, I have been thinking of working on my abductors, can you show me how to use the machine?'*"]}
