There's no food tax regardless of whose house it is.", "NTA\n\nYou said he could have the whole entire other pizza to himself, he\u2019s just lazy and probably looking for an argument.", "NTA\n\nFor starters it's Pizza, everyone knows that Pizza is sacred therefore no means no.\n\nPlus, you offered to give him his own pizza. That was mightly generous and had he *really* wanted some then he could have had some of that. He just wanted some of yours.\n\nYour husband is wrong too, I guess he has to feel for his dad a bit and there is nothing you can do about that (nor should you try). But you can educate him how sacred pizza is so he will be more understanding in future.", "INFO: does your FIL eat dinner every night WITH you and your husband? Because if so, it is a bit of an asshole move to cook a meal in front of him and not offer him any. However, if you all normally fend for yourselves, then he can figure out something else.", "NTA. As a husband and father of two I know a simple rule when it comes to pregnant women....They get to eat whatever they want, whenever they want and if they dont want to give me any to just deal with it. That's it. I'd have told my dad to make his own (since there was one) but preferably not if it's the last one in case my pregnant wife wanted it and then I'd have run to the store to get extras.", "You live with your FIL and say his very controlling and childish? But: he asked you for a piece of the pizza, you said no and he wasn\u2019t happy, but that\u2019s it. You have the advantage of being pregnant for the voting, therefore: ESH and not YTA.

How hard would that have been?\n\nIt's always amazing to me when people are so rude to others who literally have offered you a roof over your head in apparently some time of need. If you're so aggravated by this guy then move out, I'm sure he wants that as well.", "NTA. As you said, there's another one in the freezer. You are in no way his personal cook, and it's not like it's that much work for him to go toss another one in the oven. Imagine bothering a pregnant woman for her food and getting indignant when she says there's more in the freezer. \n\n\"But I wanted that one!\"", "NTA. Disagree with people saying ESH. He should be making your pregnant ass food. \n\nI got annoyed just by reading when he shuffled up behind you and asked if you were going to eat all that. So sick of old men that expect to be fucking catered to. And I\u2019m a dude. I know too many old fucks that sit and wait till they are served. Bish go get it yourself.", "Is he capable of cooking for himself? Do you normally eat dinners together? Are you paying rent and/or buying your own food? Did you move in with FIL because he needed help, or because you guys needed help/a place to stay?\n\nIf you always keep food and meals seperate then I don't see the issue.\n\n I lived with my in laws before and they'd often cook for us, so if I did prepare anything - I would have likely returned the favor and at least ask if they wanted anything before I cooked something. If you ever share food/meals, buy groceries together, etc then there was a second one so you could have asked him ahead of time if he's interested and if yes, then you cooked the second. Or when he asked you could have given him half and made the 2nd one. If you've never shared meals with each other and always eat seperately, but groceries seperately, etc then eff him. Let him grumble. \n\nWhen I lived with my in laws, since they did us a favor my letting us stay there for cheap, I was pretty considerate and didn't treat then like a regular roomate so probably would have offered half and made the 2nd. But I don't know the full situation so it's hard to really say.", "ESH - Making him the second pizza at the same time would have required so little effort that it's hard not to vote this way.", "NTA  He just wanted YOUR pizza.  He clearly wasn't hungry enough to pop one in the oven himself.", "If you don't care, why ask...\n\nSlight YTA - not for not sharing but you live with the man for free and when he first asked for a piece, you should have said no but there is another one in there if you want to make it for yourself.", "NTA. He's the asshole for trying to take food away from a pregnant woman. Who does that? OK, maybe he has dementia and you can forgive him. But it's for his own good. Keep your mouth off my food or you'll get bitten.   \n\n\nAll this stuff about sharing when you cook in a shared household does not count when you've nuked or toaster oven-ed yourself a single serving of fast food.   \n\n\nGood on you for not eating it in front of him though. It's a good thing to try to not taunt a person with the cognition challenges.", "NTA", "YTA if you live in a home with others its common courtesy to ask if they want u to throw extra in the oven for them.

If not give him a slice or pay him rent.", "NAH.  Not sure about the relationship, but generally when one prepares food you ask if anyone else in the house wants any.  It saves you from situations like this. It's usually just as easy to prepare for multiple people as it is for one. (You are not obligated to handle special orders. If you are making pizza, no one gets to ask for a grilled cheese.) There really is a basic manners rule here about not eating in front of other People without offering to share. Still: grumpy old man who can't fend for himself vs pregnant woman who is hungry.

He can certainly take care of cooking his own.\n\nAs far as not wanting to cook a whole pizza for someone just asking for a slice, why not just cook a slice of the other pizza? Keep the rest frozen for another time. \n\nIn your situation I might have tossed a slice of the other pizza in the oven and told him it would be ready in X minutes for him to take it out and turn off the oven. I might equally likely have simply let him do it completely himself too. It\u2019s a frozen pizza not a gourmet multi course meal."]}
