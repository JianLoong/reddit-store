If you ever share food/meals, buy groceries together, etc then there was a second one so you could have asked him ahead of time if he's interested and if yes, then you cooked the second.

Six and a half months pregnant isn't so far along she is incapable of helping someone else.\n\nHonestly...paying less than $200 per week for a home and expenses is a huge break in costs. OP might try a little gratitude. Yes, he's old and cranky...but he's also being very kind by allowing two, soon to be three, people to move in. What would she do if he decided he didn't need the hassle of having a bratty pregnant moocher in the house?\n\nESH.", "Poor old man probably thought he would actually have someone make food for him, more likely. OP offered ANOTHER pizza he could have made.", "I didn\u2019t realize that living with someone and paying below market rent makes you their servant. OP said he was welcome to the other pizza she bought that was in the freezer. She is not obligated to make it for him just because she doesn\u2019t pay full market rent. She was already being nice by offering to let him have the other one that she bought.", "Lmaooo shuffle britches", "Lol okay, that's valid. I must have missed that detail, and it definitely changes things.", "That clears things up. \nNTA.", "Can't he just check the freezer?", "I normally just slice it in half once, fold the two halves and go full blown Goblin Slob on that bitch."]}
