{"id": 31988, "submission_id": "186uaue", "title": "AITA for refusing to film my brother's wedding?", "selftext": "I (27M) have a brother Rob (30M). We aren't close. We fought a lot as kids, he wound me up and took the piss. He hated me being around his friends, ignored me at school and ignored me in the pub when we were teenagers. Nowadays we're civil and can have a laugh but if we're together more than a day the insults and piss-take will start.\n\nI got married last year. My best friend was Best Man and I had six other friends, Rob and my BIL as Ushers all in matching wedding suits. When I first told my parents about the wedding my dad said \"So Rob will be the Best Man?\" Typical dad, thinks his sons are best mates. I said no but it made me think I should give Rob a proper role. When I told Rob my news I asked him to be an Usher and also to make a speech. I invited him on my Stag Do and he attended. At the wedding, Rob and his fiancee were seated near the Top Table with people they knew and got on with. He loved giving a speech and took delight in telling embarrassing stories. I expected this and took it in good humour.\n\nRob's getting married soon. Best friend is Best Man. Six friends and his future BIL have been asked to be Ushers. They are going for suit fittings soon.I have not been asked to be an Usher nor to wear the proper suit. I have not been invited to his Stag Do, but his future BIL and FIL were. On the seating plan my wife and are on the table furthest from the Top Table with much older guests who we don't know.\n\nHurt? Yes. Surprised? No, this is typical of how he's treated me all my life.\n\nI made one remark to my parents that it was clear I wouldn't be involved much in the wedding but didn't make an issue of it. 2 days later I got a message from Rob. \"Mum tells me you're whingeing about the wedding. Don't worry, we'll find you a job.\" (I know my mum would not have said I was whingeing).\n\nNext time I saw them his fiancee said they want me to film their wedding for them. They'd buy a decent camera and some editing software so I could make them a beautiful memento of their day. All this was said with a beaming smile like I was being given the best job in the world.\n\nI was clearly being asked as an afterthought and to give me a \"role\". It would be like I was staff, working all day. Videography isn't my thing. I don't accept the argument that all you have to do is point a camera the right way. It's a task that requires skills I don't have. I would struggle with editing it afterwards and that would be hours of work. It would look amateurish and I know that Rob would use that to take the piss out of me for the rest of our lives like he already does with other stuff.\n\nI said I could accept not being asked to be an Usher, not being included in the suits and not being asked on the Stag Do. I could even accept being sat as far away from the rest of the family as possible with people I don't know. But I can't accept being demoted to unpaid staff doing a job that has only been offered to me as an afterthought. I then left.\n\nRob has messaged me calling me an AH.

I'm so sorry this is the brother you have. \n\nDo not take pictures or film their wedding. \n\nThey are setting you up for failure. They want your wedding gift and contribution to be material for them to torment you indefinitely. \n\nSounds like the happy couple are too childish and spiteful to make a success of marriage. But that thankfully is not your problem.", "NTA\n\nYour brother loves to bully you. There's really nothing else to say. You're 30 and 27 and he hasn't slowed down so it's clear he's going to do this for the rest of your lives. Why bother having a relationship with him at all beyond what is absolutely necessary? \n\nYou're completely correct on videography by the way. Not only would you do an amateurish job (because you're an amateur!) that would be more fuel for bullying, but you'd basically be working the entire wedding. They aren't going to want the video to stop during the dancing for instance. You'd basically do a full day's work for no pay. \n\nI'd attend, do your own thing and then after the wedding I'd go as low-contact as possible. The best thing you can say about him is \"keep it civil and have a laugh\" can last for a day but you can do that with anyone in a pub after 5 minutes so what are you even getting out of this?", "NTA. He doesn't like you, and is rubbing it in with this stupid task. You could be an A and agree, but utterly muck up the video, just film backs of heads or knees. And don't spend days editing like a proper videographer, just put some Kpop over the speeches and that'll do.  But why go at all? Don't you have something better to do that day, painting the garage door or re-watching Hawaii Five O (original series)?", "NTA. The nerve, selling it as some big favour they are doing you.\n\nAnd you are right about how it's not simple. Every day almost at the r/photography sub people come and say \"So I have to shoot a wedding, how do I do it?\" and the unanimous advice is always \"Don't!\"  It's REALLY difficult, even for people with experience. And you WILL not do a good job, and everyone WILL blame you for the poor result, and everyone WILL think you are useless because \"aLL yOu haD tO Do waS pOint anD shOot\".", "NTA.\n\nSigning up for photographer/videographer will bring you **no end of trouble**. It's not only the hours of work, but since it \"requires skills I don't have,\" the result probably won't be up to Rob's standards, and then you'll have to deal with **years of him complaining** about how you ruined his wedding because he has no good photos. Hell no!\n\nBut even if you were a great wedding photographer, it wouldn't be an asshole move to refuse to do it for free at your brother's wedding. You are family. You should be able to experience it, not be there as a worker. It sounds like he is trying to punish you for not being best man.", ">They'd buy a decent camera and some editing software so I could make them a beautiful memento of their day\n\nHow gracious of them. Aren't you the lucky fella.\n\n>Rob has messaged me calling me an AH. AITA?\n\nNo, but Rob is. Jeez.", "Info: are you actually planning on attending this wedding?", "NTA and Rob is a dick. Who doesn\u2019t invite their brother to their stag do?  he offered you a huge job instead of being a groomsman or usher \u2026.seriously the videography is a massive job and he thinks he\u2019s including you \u2026by getting you to save him thousands \u2026yup, nta", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t bother even going tbh. Rob drew the line in the sand as to what he thinks of you. \n\nGo do something enriching with your wife that day. The money you would spend on a gift, clothes and gas - put that into a relationship worth having. \n\nNot even having you at a close table. Brutal. What a prick.", "NTA.\n\nNo matter what you do, that video is never going to be good enough for Rob.  Just don't do it.\n\nPour it on thick to Rob and his fiance: \"I know I wouldn't be able to do justice to your special day because my skills just aren't up to the task.  You deserve a special video!  Please just hire someone who can give you exactly what you want.\"\n\nLet Rob and his fiance hire someone, and just go to the wedding as a guest.", "NTA\n\nEven without the backstory, you would not be the AH.\n\nIt will mean that you will not be able to enjoy the wedding, **and** you will then have to spend hours editing, **and** they won't like anything you do anyway.", "NTA - Bravo stating how you've been excluded and delegated to an unpaid staff position.  Yes, their video pitch was an afterthought. \n\nHis decisions were intentional and hurtful which is on par with how he treated you while living with your parents. Remain focused on the authentic positive friends and family in your life. Best to you!", "NTA but your bro is and kind of your parents!! Can you not time his wedding with a pregnancy reveal or something, a lotto win!! The cure for cu#t$ that you could gift him and his puppet!! If you have some serious cash organise the holiday of a lifetime poss Inc some family or really close friends!! And document the hell out of it on camcorder!!", " NTA didn\u2019t even extend an invite to the stag do, are you sure you even want to go?", "At this stage I'd consider having your own  wedding reception. With blackjack. And hookers. (Maybe not the hookers since you're married but you get the idea. NTA)", "You know how your brother is, you tried to be nice to him and he won't reciprocate. In my opinion you have two choices, the first is the correct one which is to turn down the being the videographer and just sitting in the back eat free food talk to your parents and then leave when you want.\n\nThe second more Petty option is to be the videographer. And have everything out of focus and do extreme close-ups of the bride's ear your brother's butt only their feet during the dance have the sound off during speeches. Only take pictures of butts and elbows. Then edit your backwards so it seems like they're getting a divorce and not married. What you going to do still hate you?\n\nIn reality say no to work in the camera, if they insist say $300 an hour, just sit in the back enjoy the food laugh at the stupid stuff they're doing and realize he's not going to change and you can't make him.\n\nIt's up to you to make the best of a crappy situation and try to have fun on your own and think of it as a fun party and not a person who doesn't like you wedding\n\nNta", "NTA. \n\nF\u2019 all of that noise. You sound like a top bloke considering the nonsense you\u2019ve dealt with regarding your brother and I applaud you for being such a good sport and excellent brother during your wedding. Very cool of you all around. \n\nAs for the way big-bro is treating you at his wedding, you definitely shouldn\u2019t attend. Send a card and a gift, but don\u2019t attend, he\u2019s an absolute piss take and his future wife doesn\u2019t sound any better. Seriously, I, a stranger, will be disappointed with you if you decide to go.", "NTA - why would you want to work at a wedding?", "You\u2019re right about everything. Don\u2019t do it. You aren\u2019t ruining anything. They wouldn\u2019t be happy with it anyway.", "NTA. Why even go with his attitude? Waste of time unless you like being petty if anyone asks why you're not at the family table.", "NTA- at this point I\u2019d say F the wedding and not go", "NTA. I'd book a nice vacation for myself and my wife the day of his wedding. Somewhere several hours away, possibly out of state/country. Have a grand old time, post all the pictures you like on FB, and then block your AH brother and never pay him any mind except shared family gatherings again.", "NTA. Your brother fucking sucks, dude.", "NTA. Why even go to the wedding? Do literally anything else that day.", "NTA. Your brother sounds like a prick to be honest. Also, what kind of absolute buffoon would have someone who has no experience in videography video the wedding? That is a hard, tasking, long job that is usually very expensive. Like not asking you to usher or be in the bridal party is one thing, but what an absolute git to not sit you close with those you are familiar with and excluding you from the stag do. Like at what point does it go from just taking the piss to actually just being a mean spirited person?", "NTA, your brother and future SIL are. Your brother expected you to learn how to properly video a wedding, with only one camera(!), *and* learn how to edit videos? Really? He was almost certainly setting you up for failure. You really need 2 videos to get a good quality wedding video, and there's a lot more to editing than just splicing segments together.", "NTA. I\u2019m still bitter about my friend\u2019s wedding. I wasn\u2019t asked to be involved in the wedding except making the cake. When I mentioned I was a bit hurt not to be invited to read etc when people she knew for far less time were, she said \u2018but you\u2019re making the cake\u2019. I didn\u2019t think quickly enough, but wanted to say- but that\u2019s hard bloody work and expensive, it\u2019s not the same thing.\n\nETA they are divorced now but I\u2019m still holding the grudge.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like they might also be trying to cheap out on their wedding by not hiring a professional.\n\nAt this point, with this relationship? I'd stop trying. You keep putting water into a bucket with no bottom and you just end up with wet feet. \n\nWhen my grandmother died, my mother said that her funeral would be the last time that her and her siblings would be gathered together, and that has since held up. Nothing wrong with it. It's just they way it is, and everyone was better for it.", "NTA. I was in almost the exact same situation, but with my cousin, not my brother. I stupidly accepted the position, even though videography and editing are not at all in my skill set either. The result was exactly what you\u2019re worrying yours would be. \n\nIt WAS and still is held against me. You\u2019re smart to say no. Your brother sounds like a great guy btw \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. \n\nYou said you don't have the skill to be a videographer and declined respectfully. That is the responsible thing to do imo.", "NTA\n\nHe is deliberately being an ass to you.\n\nHardly worth the effort of going.", "NTA. Did your dad not have the same talk with your brother that he did with you?

This is a massive time commitment beyond the day of the actual wedding, and the final product won't turn out well if you don't know what you're doing. There are no re-shoots for wedding videos, and it takes real skill to know where you need to be to capture things at all, let alone in an aesthetically pleasing way.
