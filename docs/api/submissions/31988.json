{"id": 31988, "submission_id": "186uaue", "title": "AITA for refusing to film my brother's wedding?", "selftext": "I (27M) have a brother Rob (30M). We aren't close. We fought a lot as kids, he wound me up and took the piss. He hated me being around his friends, ignored me at school and ignored me in the pub when we were teenagers. Nowadays we're civil and can have a laugh but if we're together more than a day the insults and piss-take will start.\n\nI got married last year. My best friend was Best Man and I had six other friends, Rob and my BIL as Ushers all in matching wedding suits. When I first told my parents about the wedding my dad said \"So Rob will be the Best Man?\" Typical dad, thinks his sons are best mates. I said no but it made me think I should give Rob a proper role. When I told Rob my news I asked him to be an Usher and also to make a speech. I invited him on my Stag Do and he attended. At the wedding, Rob and his fiancee were seated near the Top Table with people they knew and got on with. He loved giving a speech and took delight in telling embarrassing stories. I expected this and took it in good humour.\n\nRob's getting married soon. Best friend is Best Man. Six friends and his future BIL have been asked to be Ushers. They are going for suit fittings soon.I have not been asked to be an Usher nor to wear the proper suit. I have not been invited to his Stag Do, but his future BIL and FIL were. On the seating plan my wife and are on the table furthest from the Top Table with much older guests who we don't know.\n\nHurt? Yes. Surprised? No, this is typical of how he's treated me all my life.\n\nI made one remark to my parents that it was clear I wouldn't be involved much in the wedding but didn't make an issue of it. 2 days later I got a message from Rob. \"Mum tells me you're whingeing about the wedding. Don't worry, we'll find you a job.\" (I know my mum would not have said I was whingeing).\n\nNext time I saw them his fiancee said they want me to film their wedding for them. They'd buy a decent camera and some editing software so I could make them a beautiful memento of their day. All this was said with a beaming smile like I was being given the best job in the world.\n\nI was clearly being asked as an afterthought and to give me a \"role\". It would be like I was staff, working all day. Videography isn't my thing. I don't accept the argument that all you have to do is point a camera the right way. It's a task that requires skills I don't have. I would struggle with editing it afterwards and that would be hours of work. It would look amateurish and I know that Rob would use that to take the piss out of me for the rest of our lives like he already does with other stuff.\n\nI said I could accept not being asked to be an Usher, not being included in the suits and not being asked on the Stag Do. I could even accept being sat as far away from the rest of the family as possible with people I don't know. But I can't accept being demoted to unpaid staff doing a job that has only been offered to me as an afterthought. I then left.\n\nRob has messaged me calling me an AH.

I'm so sorry this is the brother you have. \n\nDo not take pictures or film their wedding. \n\nThey are setting you up for failure. They want your wedding gift and contribution to be material for them to torment you indefinitely. \n\nSounds like the happy couple are too childish and spiteful to make a success of marriage. But that thankfully is not your problem.", "NTA\n\nYour brother loves to bully you. There's really nothing else to say. You're 30 and 27 and he hasn't slowed down so it's clear he's going to do this for the rest of your lives. Why bother having a relationship with him at all beyond what is absolutely necessary? \n\nYou're completely correct on videography by the way. Not only would you do an amateurish job (because you're an amateur!) that would be more fuel for bullying, but you'd basically be working the entire wedding. They aren't going to want the video to stop during the dancing for instance. You'd basically do a full day's work for no pay. \n\nI'd attend, do your own thing and then after the wedding I'd go as low-contact as possible. The best thing you can say about him is \"keep it civil and have a laugh\" can last for a day but you can do that with anyone in a pub after 5 minutes so what are you even getting out of this?", "NTA. He doesn't like you, and is rubbing it in with this stupid task. You could be an A and agree, but utterly muck up the video, just film backs of heads or knees. And don't spend days editing like a proper videographer, just put some Kpop over the speeches and that'll do.  But why go at all? Don't you have something better to do that day, painting the garage door or re-watching Hawaii Five O (original series)?", "NTA. The nerve, selling it as some big favour they are doing you.\n\nAnd you are right about how it's not simple. Every day almost at the r/photography sub people come and say \"So I have to shoot a wedding, how do I do it?\" and the unanimous advice is always \"Don't!\"  It's REALLY difficult, even for people with experience. And you WILL not do a good job, and everyone WILL blame you for the poor result, and everyone WILL think you are useless because \"aLL yOu haD tO Do waS pOint anD shOot\".", "NTA.\n\nSigning up for photographer/videographer will bring you **no end of trouble**. It's not only the hours of work, but since it \"requires skills I don't have,\" the result probably won't be up to Rob's standards, and then you'll have to deal with **years of him complaining** about how you ruined his wedding because he has no good photos. Hell no!\n\nBut even if you were a great wedding photographer, it wouldn't be an asshole move to refuse to do it for free at your brother's wedding. You are family. You should be able to experience it, not be there as a worker. It sounds like he is trying to punish you for not being best man.", ">They'd buy a decent camera and some editing software so I could make them a beautiful memento of their day\n\nHow gracious of them. Aren't you the lucky fella.\n\n>Rob has messaged me calling me an AH. AITA?\n\nNo, but Rob is. Jeez.", "Info: are you actually planning on attending this wedding?", "NTA and Rob is a dick.

I wouldn\u2019t bother even going tbh. Rob drew the line in the sand as to what he thinks of you. \n\nGo do something enriching with your wife that day.

What a prick.", "NTA.\n\nNo matter what you do, that video is never going to be good enough for Rob.  Just don't do it.\n\nPour it on thick to Rob and his fiance: \"I know I wouldn't be able to do justice to your special day because my skills just aren't up to the task.  You deserve a special video!  Please just hire someone who can give you exactly what you want.\"\n\nLet Rob and his fiance hire someone, and just go to the wedding as a guest.", "NTA\n\nEven without the backstory, you would not be the AH.\n\nIt will mean that you will not be able to enjoy the wedding, **and** you will then have to spend hours editing, **and** they won't like anything you do anyway.", "NTA - Bravo stating how you've been excluded and delegated to an unpaid staff position.  Yes, their video pitch was an afterthought. \n\nHis decisions were intentional and hurtful which is on par with how he treated you while living with your parents. Remain focused on the authentic positive friends and family in your life. Best to you!", "NTA but your bro is and kind of your parents!! Can you not time his wedding with a pregnancy reveal or something, a lotto win!! The cure for cu#t$ that you could gift him and his puppet!! If you have some serious cash organise the holiday of a lifetime poss Inc some family or really close friends!! And document the hell out of it on camcorder!!", " NTA didn\u2019t even extend an invite to the stag do, are you sure you even want to go?", "At this stage I'd consider having your own  wedding reception. With blackjack. And hookers. (Maybe not the hookers since you're married but you get the idea. NTA)", "You know how your brother is, you tried to be nice to him and he won't reciprocate. In my opinion you have two choices, the first is the correct one which is to turn down the being the videographer and just sitting in the back eat free food talk to your parents and then leave when you want.\n\nThe second more Petty option is to be the videographer. And have everything out of focus and do extreme close-ups of the bride's ear your brother's butt only their feet during the dance have the sound off during speeches. Only take pictures of butts and elbows. Then edit your backwards so it seems like they're getting a divorce and not married. What you going to do still hate you?\n\nIn reality say no to work in the camera, if they insist say $300 an hour, just sit in the back enjoy the food laugh at the stupid stuff they're doing and realize he's not going to change and you can't make him.\n\nIt's up to you to make the best of a crappy situation and try to have fun on your own and think of it as a fun party and not a person who doesn't like you wedding\n\nNta", "NTA. \n\nF\u2019 all of that noise. You sound like a top bloke considering the nonsense you\u2019ve dealt with regarding your brother and I applaud you for being such a good sport and excellent brother during your wedding. Very cool of you all around. \n\nAs for the way big-bro is treating you at his wedding, you definitely shouldn\u2019t attend. Send a card and a gift, but don\u2019t attend, he\u2019s an absolute piss take and his future wife doesn\u2019t sound any better. Seriously, I, a stranger, will be disappointed with you if you decide to go.", "NTA - why would you want to work at a wedding?", "You\u2019re right about everything. Don\u2019t do it. You aren\u2019t ruining anything. They wouldn\u2019t be happy with it anyway.", "NTA. Why even go with his attitude? Waste of time unless you like being petty if anyone asks why you're not at the family table.", "NTA- at this point I\u2019d say F the wedding and not go", "NTA. I'd book a nice vacation for myself and my wife the day of his wedding. Somewhere several hours away, possibly out of state/country. Have a grand old time, post all the pictures you like on FB, and then block your AH brother and never pay him any mind except shared family gatherings again.", "NTA. Your brother fucking sucks, dude.", "NTA. Why even go to the wedding? Do literally anything else that day.", "NTA. Your brother sounds like a prick to be honest. Also, what kind of absolute buffoon would have someone who has no experience in videography video the wedding? That is a hard, tasking, long job that is usually very expensive. Like not asking you to usher or be in the bridal party is one thing, but what an absolute git to not sit you close with those you are familiar with and excluding you from the stag do. Like at what point does it go from just taking the piss to actually just being a mean spirited person?", "NTA, your brother and future SIL are. Your brother expected you to learn how to properly video a wedding, with only one camera(!), *and* learn how to edit videos? Really? He was almost certainly setting you up for failure. You really need 2 videos to get a good quality wedding video, and there's a lot more to editing than just splicing segments together.", "NTA. I\u2019m still bitter about my friend\u2019s wedding. I wasn\u2019t asked to be involved in the wedding except making the cake. When I mentioned I was a bit hurt not to be invited to read etc when people she knew for far less time were, she said \u2018but you\u2019re making the cake\u2019. I didn\u2019t think quickly enough, but wanted to say- but that\u2019s hard bloody work and expensive, it\u2019s not the same thing.\n\nETA they are divorced now but I\u2019m still holding the grudge.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like they might also be trying to cheap out on their wedding by not hiring a professional.\n\nAt this point, with this relationship? I'd stop trying. You keep putting water into a bucket with no bottom and you just end up with wet feet. \n\nWhen my grandmother died, my mother said that her funeral would be the last time that her and her siblings would be gathered together, and that has since held up. Nothing wrong with it. It's just they way it is, and everyone was better for it.", "NTA. I was in almost the exact same situation, but with my cousin, not my brother. I stupidly accepted the position, even though videography and editing are not at all in my skill set either. The result was exactly what you\u2019re worrying yours would be. \n\nIt WAS and still is held against me. You\u2019re smart to say no. Your brother sounds like a great guy btw \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. \n\nYou said you don't have the skill to be a videographer and declined respectfully. That is the responsible thing to do imo.", "NTA\n\nHe is deliberately being an ass to you.\n\nHardly worth the effort of going.", "NTA.

Finger over the lense, \"accidentally\" filming the wrong way, zooming in and not knowing how to zoom out, etc..", "NTA\n\nWhy go at all? I say you & your wife take a nice little vacation.", "NTA. As you say, videography is hard - and filming a wedding is a one-off occasion, so definitely something you don\u2019t want for a first ever job. Let them pay for the professionals.", "NTA. I think you and your wife should take a trip that weekend instead of the wedding", "How about just SKIP this \" wedding\" and go Low-Contact or No-Contact with this \" brother\" who is  a BOTHER\n\n\nBlood doesn't make the family Love Does\n\n\nN\nT\nA", "Where I live, videographers start at around $1500. There is no way that you being made labor is a thoughtful gesture. It's cheap and insulting.\n\nNTA", "NTA- it would be a no thanks from me too", "NTA. I would consider declining going to the wedding if Rob and FSIL start harassing you. I would also have a talk with your parents about trying to interfere with your relationship with Rob and tell them exactly how he has treated you over the years and why you can't have the relationship with Rob that they want.", "It's likely that Rob and his fianc\u00e9e have a professional wedding photographer already lined up, and he's setting OP up for humiliation...", "NTA at all. You guys aren\u2019t close so I can see the usher roll not being offered and that hurting but then he sat you at the back. Away from family with your wife. Now he wants you to work for free and leave your wife alone with people she doesn\u2019t know. He seems like he\u2019s trying to piss you off and he\u2019s definitely the AH", "Step one: do a crappy job of filming part of the events - and none of the important bits.\n\nStep two: have somebody read & record this thread with all the comments saying over and over and over again how much of an AH his brother is.\n\nstep three: edit the video so that the only sound is the recording of the person reading out this thread.\n\nNTA, your brother is, though, and he\u2019s made it abundantly clear that he\u2019d rather not even have you at the wedding. The way he\u2019s treating you is beyond insulting.", "NTA.  To be honest, if I was in your shoes, I'd be tempted not to attend the wedding and skip the whole mess.  But that's your decision.  I would also refuse the job of videographer.   It's a no win situation - no matter how good it is, they won't be happy with it and will blame you.  As tempting as it might be to accept the job and sabotage the wedding video, I would not recommend doing anything that will make you look bad, upset the rest of the family and give your brother ammunition to say that's why he didn't have you in the wedding party - because he knew you would be a jerk.  Take the high road.  On the plus side, if you choose to attend the wedding as a regular guest, it means you can be free to enjoy time with the rest of your family and friends, without any workload, no best man or groomsmen expenses, etc.  Sounds to me like he unintentionally did you a favour, if you decide to go.  Don't be put off by being seated with \"older guests you don't know\".  Us oldies can be lots of fun if you give us a chance.  However, you should probably discuss this background with your parents so they know where you are coming from and are not just being petulant in saying no.", "No offense to any of your abilities, or lack thereof, but who in their right mind gets an amateur who apparently knows nothing about videography and doesn't even own a camera to film their wedding?\n\nThat is a job purely for professionals, just like the photography, catering, and everything else.\n\nJust say no thanks, that you would prefer to just enjoy the wedding.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Time to go no contact. He's a significant net negative impact on your life.", "NTA.  i would not even attend the wedding.  go have a fun day with your wife", "Sorry your brother is such a jerk, but you are right to say No to being the video person.  That's an all-day job for someone to be paid, unless someone loves it and volunteered.  You're NTA.", "NTA at all. But if you want to \"play his game\", tell him you'll take the \"job\", name an amount you'd like and say that you need half up front, then do a mediocre job of it.", "NTA. But here's a thought. Just because he's a s***** brother doesn't mean you have to be a s***** brother.\n\nPolitely declined his invitation to video his wedding. Tell him that he would not be pleased with the result due to your inexperience.\n\nAttend the wedding as a guest and family member, put on a smile, and be polite. This isn't for him, this is for your parents. This also takes the wind out of his sails, because now he can't say that you misbehaved, or that you were difficult; you're simply not giving him any ammunition. Drop the rope.\n\nMinimize contact afterward. Be cordial when you see him, but don't try to engage.\n\nYou taking the high road will force him to either join you, improving a relationship that many would kill to have, or make him look bad by comparison. Either way, you win.\n\nOh, and if you have kids, keep them away from him.", "I bet your mom and dad want you to just let it go because \"family\".  Just book a weekend away instead for you and your wife so you can actually enjoy yourselves. And do NOT buy them a gift.", "Do not agree to any of these nonesense and if someone is being pushy ignore them for rest of your life. NTA", "Absolutely not.  I would just pull a no show.  Not tell anyone, just don\u2019t show up.  Wouldn\u2019t waste anymore of my time with someone that doesn\u2019t care about me and leaves me out.  If someone isn\u2019t putting positive energy in, then they don\u2019t get to be in my life.", "NTA i wouldn't even go", "NTA. Film the ceiling or just from their necks up, don\u2019t edit anything", "Definitely not the AH, Rob on the other hand is TAH big time.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is awful.\n\nYou\u2019re an obligation he doesn\u2019t want, and thought he could use this situation to his advantage to get free labor.\n\nAnd it was the right call to decline based on the fact you don\u2019t have the skills alone. \n\nHim calling you an asshole for not taking the setup is just more of the same terrible, disrespectful treatment.", "That is way too nice for his prick of a brother tbh.", "I love how the grudge lasted longer than the mariage", "You are right!", "\u201cWhat a lovely carpet!\u201d Quick nauseating pan up to see the bride enter and\u2026. \nBlank for twenty minutes. \n\nThen a quick visit to the car leaving until it\u2019s just your feet walking to the afterparty.\n\nand then a two hour film documenting who walks through to the bathroom facilities, past the camera set up.", "Film the day but keep the lens cap on.", "Don't forget the random, creepy, \"tcha tcha tcha\" (like in the early Friday the 13th films).", "This is just too beautiful lol! ... I'd include some unnaturally big butt photos of the happy couple as well.", "You win, this is gold!!", "Can't stop laughing!!", "I had an amateur volunteer to be the behind-the-scenes documentary cameraman for an event.\n\nI have media and filming experience and no one listened to me. Even when I did six months of presentation training just to be an MC, rather than risk being under-confident or unprepared for the challenge.\n\nAmateur volunteer left the camera on the setting that was best suited for a Ring camera, it seemed? Tiny screen. And they left camera shake on. Forgot to turn on the mic or have an external mic.\n\nI eventually got the footage years later after negotiating with the AV team, who I think hid it out of shame. \n\nI watched about a minute of badly panned hallway \u201csetting the scene\u201d and an interview that involved two things:\n- The presenters sitting down and getting comfortable, then\n- The presenters getting up and laughing and leaving.\n\nWondering if there\u2019s a way to recycle the drive so nobody has to know what\u2019s on it.", "Keep the camera pointing at the floor!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "Nah, because then his brother would be able to whine to the family about how OP ruined their big day and, from what OP says, would probably get a lot of sympathy for it.", "I'd videotape the wedding, but record something over half of it... maybe an infomercial about bikini waxing or something...", "I also thought they were trying to use their siblings skillset to be freeloaders.\n\nI'm not sure if this is worse.. it's just kind of like.. \"what?\"", "And film every urinal and unflushed toilet\u2026", "Zoom in on all birds and nose picks through the ceremony", "The wedding was Saturday?!?  I thought it was Sunday.
