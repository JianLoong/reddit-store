He's a huge AH, and if I were you I wouldn't be spending time around him anymore.", "NTA\n\nI read somewhere that a joke is only a joke if everyone is laughing.

You and your sister both said you were uncomfortable and asked him to stop. \n\n\"What did I do?\" He knows what he did.

Dude is clearly just actually misogynistic and trying to excuse it. \"It's just a joke!\" doesn't work like that when you're just saying things that you believe", "NTA.

I used to have a friend that would state his actual opinions as a \"joke.\" This way if people got offended, he didn't feel the need to apologize because it was just a joke. I had known him for long enough to know the truth though. Sounds like your BIL might be the same kind of person. With television people say if you don't like the show change the channel.
