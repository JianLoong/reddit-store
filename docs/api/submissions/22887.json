I swear my horse was sneering at us all changing tires.", "My dad\u2019s taught me to ask the mechanic to do the final nut tightening by hand. That way they were easier for me - lacking upper body strength - to crack in an emergency. I\u2019ve told this to some male friends who appreciate it too.", "I guess that was my thought. It\u2019s great his daughter learns out of the box skills that enable her to be independent. But is he seeing to it the boys know how to cook and clean?", "However, I learned the hard way to not fix a toilet your first week in a new dorm (or rather, don\u2019t let anyone know you know how to do that, until they know you better).  I became the dedicated dorm plumber/toilet expert, just for\u2026 knowing how toilets work? \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\n\nI was proud at first, but later wished I had just fixed it in silence\u2026 or started charging for it lol", "Honestly, this is wonderful. There was a lot that my father outright refused to teach me, because I was a girl. It still pisses me off that he claimed grilling was a man\u2019s job. \n\nI ended up with a buddy who got angry about it on my behalf as well and he and a couple of other guy friends made sure to teach me things like how to change my oil and general car maintenance, grilling with charcoal and gas, how to shoot a gun, and more. My friends doing that made me feel loved.", "Like a penis gets in the way of a guy standing in front of a stove lol?", "I actually prefer mowing the lawn to other outside chores, whereas my husband likes to take care of the flower garden. \n\nOP is NTA in the least.", "He is seriously the most wholesome man! My Dad taught me plenty, and still teaches me what he can, but I still watch the \u201cDad How Do I?\u201d videos!", "Drop a link!!", "Mine too. Actually came in handy at a grad school party when soeones battery died and they crossed the wires trying to jump it. I was the only one that knew how to stop it from smoking and get the car started. And I was in a dress and heels.", "Unless you use your genitals to complete the task, chores are unisex.  OP is doing great for his daughter by teaching her outdoor chores.  Just as boys should know how to do laundry, clean a house, cook and bonus points: do basic sewing.", "A friend posted a comic a few days ago where a little girl asks dad if she can use his tools. He says yes, wife behind him says \"this will end poorly.\" He responds \"actually, I expect this to start poorly.\" The last panel is dad as an old man, now adult daughter saying \"I fixed the roof, dad\" and him saying \"thanks, sweetheart!\"\n\nMy dad, as faulty as he was, was both handy and the better cook. We had tools (both brother and I, and yes, I'm a woman) in our hands from a young age. And we learned a little about cooking. My brother is not so good at following directions, so I often end up coming behind him and correcting small mistakes. The most recent one was installing a deadbolt upside down at his home. After I jammed my thumb on it (because it turned the wrong way), I said something to my SIL, and she said she always did the same thing. \"Give me a phillips head and this problem is solved!\" I'm not sure he's even realized I flipped it over (this was about a week ago).\n\nMy famous was building my own platform for my washer and dryer (why would I pay for pedestals when some plywood and 2x6's would do the trick?). My handyman was coming to finish up some stuff (I bought a fixer-upper) and I told him that I needed help moving it into the laundry room. We put it in place, I used a level to level it (of course I put adjustable feet on it), and I bolted it onto the studs (front-loading washers spin very fast, so the surface they're on needs to be very secure). My handyman kept looking at it and looking at me, then said \"you built this?\" \"Yep.\" \"How long did it take you?\" \"A day, plus one more for the poly coat to dry so if I drop a wet sock on it it won't ruin the wood. It's just a box. I had the hardware store cut the wood, since I don't have room for a table saw.\" \"I knew you knew how to do stuff, but this is impressive!\" I didn't tell him I left out the drawers from the online plans I found since an empty space where you can stick laundry baskets is more useful to me. :)", "I have to rewatch the tie one every time I go to a wedding \ud83d\ude02"]}
