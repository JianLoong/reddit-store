I was beyond tickled when I bought myself a drill and learned how to use it as an adult. Lol", "My father passed when I was 15, which makes the memories even more special to me. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "Doesn't say so in post and I didn't dig thru all the comments \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f oops I guess", "Sorry if I was not clear.  All I see is women are expected to do all work, boys only mens work.  And if they do crappy jobs at cleaning, it falls to women.", "Stop arguing with the misogynist - no use", "NTA all the way. I am the youngest daughter and not only would I fight to be the one who mowed the lawn, I would shower beforehand so I could smell like fresh cut grass the rest of the day. It's a weirdly therapeutic chore I've found. I liked getting clean lines.", "Sure", "Yep. I am 30 and don't know how to work a lawnmower. I also.... don't have a lawn (apartment). But I still wish those were things I knew how to do for when I can afford a house.", "C\u2019mon, you know that a vagina will get in the way of the mower! /s", "Leave it to reddit to go off topic and come back with some wild info. Also op is NTA", "I\u2019m not sure this tracks. Car maintenance and lawn mowing and other household/building chores often fall to men and they also make mechanical smashing sounds quite often. Ever run over a screw or piece of plastic unexpectedly hidden in the grass with the mower? Super loud and clangy. Car maintenance also involves banging metal sounds occasionally too.", "100% It's all basic life skills that everyone should know.", "Even adults end up sometimes getting partial foot amputations due to lawnmower blades.  It\u2019s sort of like seat belts.  No they aren\u2019t necessary for the car to run but in the event of an accident they can prevent it from becoming much worse.  And you absolutely can buy steel toed boots for kids. On Amazon even.\n\nhttps://publications.aap.org/aapnews/article/34/7/24/24697/Is-your-child-ready-to-take-on-mowing-the-lawn\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatricians recommends age 12 to operate a push mower and 16 for a riding lawnmower.", "You can definitely buy steel toe boots that fit children.", "No \ud83d\ude05 thank you!", "Sounds like you might like the show Alone! Season 6 is on Netflix for free, and some others are on Apple TV at a cost. My boyfriend and I have been binge watching. I'm not a survivalist at all, and even I find it interesting. I have developed an appreciation for people who are into that sort of thing. So cool!", "Excellent parenting. Good job all around Dad", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss, I\u2019m glad you have those memories \u2665\ufe0f", "Where in the comments does it say that?", "There are women who do landscaping - and are good at it. Same as men becoming chefs, or clothing designers. It's 2023 not 1950.", "\"Ah, shit, she perioded all over the mower again!\"\n\nLOL, people like OP's wife are like weird caricatures.", "Wish my parents had taught me how to do things around the house and outside.  I did basic cleaning, yeah, but I had the attitude that I never wanted a house with a lawn, that I would live in a condo or something.  Life doesn't always work out the way you think when you are 12.  Now sitting here, a single mother with a house and a huge lawn and lots of things that need to be handled, and no way to live anywhere else unless I want to pull my kid out of the fantastic school system that he has been in since kindergarten, away from all his friends.\n\nCuz it would have killed me and been unfair to me to learn basic life and adulting skills.  Got it.\n\nThank God for YouTube.", "Not everyone needs to cook either. You could order out your entire life. You could hire laundry services forever. You could hire a housecleaner too. You may never need to own a vehicle. Your concept of what is a necessary life skill is insane.", "What planet do you live on?? You feeling bad because your kids are useless?", "You\u2019re being a good dad. I was hurt my dad left me out of the guy stuff and later learned to do things from boyfriends. My dad spent a lot more time with my brothers and I felt rejected. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing. As an aside, I was a step parent too. My daughter is 36 now and I\u2019m long divorced but we are very close and I\u2019m so lucky she\u2019s in my life. She was in her early 20\u2019s when I divorced her dad and she was devastated as she thought we\u2019d grow apart but I\u2019d never let that happen.", "The odds of that happening are fairly slim.  Any parent properly teaching their child and monitoring what they do will have less accidents.  Also, most new mowers have built in safety features minimizing accidents.  \n\nI was using a riding lawnmower at 11 cutting an acre of land.  Knew how to use it and maintain it.  What the AAP recommends is nice but parents need to decide when their children are ready for some things, not someone that\u2019s never had to do manual labor their life and wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a lawnmower or other tools if they were put in front of them.", "[deleted]", "Thank you \ud83d\udc97", "\ud83d\ude02", "\"Nope, she has PMS, can't mow the lawn until next week\"", "They said they\u2019re childfree. Now I\u2019m also childfree, but I generally make it a practice not to tell people how to parent, since, you know, I don\u2019t have any experience\u2026\n\n\nAs my sister with seven kids likes to say, the best parents out there are the ones without kids!", "I know. Just saying manufacturers do make protective gear in child sizes.", "lol did a mower eat your toes or something?", "Clearly his parents were killed in a mowing accident and vowed to stop all lawn maintenance across the world. They call him No Mow Man!", "Don\u2019t ever have kids. Ever. Literally just don\u2019t. Your kids will hate you and your neighbors will laugh at you.", "BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!", "No... You would be the parent with a kid punching the employees in the store because they didn't let them take a crap in the middle of the aisle...\n\nAmazing how people without kids seem to know what actually having a kid is like.\n\nEvery kid I knew with a parent that had your ideologies resented their parents when they became adults bc they failed to teach them the basics...  That is first hand experience from kids who had parents who talked like you...", "You hated that you were given chores to do as a child, right? According to you a child shouldn\u2019t learn to do anything because they can just hire someone to do it for them as an adult. And that since the parents chose to have a child, the child should not be doing anything because they did not ask to be born? Are you coping as an adult?"]}
