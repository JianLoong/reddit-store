I was raised non religious and celebrate Christmas. When we had our son we agreed to raise him Jewish but also celebrate Christmas. \n\nHe's three and this is his first year in nursery. They've been doing Christmas crafts and learning carols. On Friday he started singing \"away in a manger\". She was uncomfortable and asked what other songs they sing. He couldn't list any, but she asked for a list on Monday and got one. Theres a couple \"Jesus\" songs, basically. \n\nShe was pretty upset when we sat down for dinner. I told her it was no big deal. He doesn't suddenly believe Jesus was the messiah because he sang about a shiny star. He's three.\n\nShe argued that its setting up a precedent, its worming into his subconscious. I told her she was being dramatic. Like half of his class is muslim and they are also taking part. It's just music.\n\nShe got pretty upset, said it was different and that she \"didn't expect\" me to get it. On Tuesday she spoke to the nursery nurses and told them she didn't want him to partake. They said they didn't have that option but she was free to take him out until after Christmas. \n\nShe brought him home, to me, who works from home. I took him back. It's seriously not that serious. \n\nI told her she could take the time off work if she desperately doesn't want him there, but he already knows the songs so whats the point? Friday is his last day anyway.\n\nShe made a fuss this morning about having it noted in hia chart following that they need to make accommodation for him when celebrating religion. \n\nWe've been fighting for a while over it. Everyone we know is evenly split - some think she's dramatic, some think I'm an asshole for making such a deal out of something that clearly means a lot to her.

I don\u2019t think my opinion on this really says who\u2019s the AH or not.\n\nThis is something you and she will have to discuss in-depth. It wasn\u2019t right of her to take him out of the daycare, knowing she\u2019d be putting all of his care on you while you\u2019re working. It also isn\u2019t right that you put him back in without discussing, even though I understand from your perspective because the work was put on you. Both of you made unilateral decisions without consulting the other, I give you more slack because yours was in direct response to what she did, but obviously this issue of raised-Jewish-but-celebrating-Christmas is more involved and deep-rooted than either of you thought.\n\nThis is obviously a big deal to her, and her religion, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful for you to be so dismissive. Try to understand her perspective and where she\u2019s coming from.\n\nIf this is a big concern for her, I wonder if there are any Jewish daycares in the area that could watch your son?", "Here's the thing, acknowledging the divinity of Jesus or his role as the messiah per the Christian faith is kinda perhaps the biggest form of blasphemy you could ever commit in the Jewish religion.\n\nJudaism teaches that the messiah will and has not yet returned. It also asserts as a core tenet that there is only one God. The Christian tripartite divinity of messianic Jesus is like nightmare level blasphemy as a Jew.\n\nI'll say NTA because you yourself are not Jewish but if you earnestly want to respect your wife's wishes and the agreement you had with her you will need to address the problem somehow as this cannot be a recurring thing every year (assuming your agreement).\n\nI do disagree with her action of interfering with your work though, I think that is an over reaction especially when as you say, the last day is Friday anyway.", "Your difference in beliefs is going to cause this child confusion. I suggest having a conversation amongst each other on how to go about this without confusing the child when they are older.", "ESH- you for dismissing her feelings and her for dropping him off with you when you are working.\n\nLesson learned.  You two need to have a discussion about what it means to be\u201draise your son Jewish\u201d because many public schools in many places also celebrate religiously.  Don\u2019t dismiss her feelings- you two need to work together.  \n\nIt\u2019s honestly not a big deal now - our daughter also started singing about her love for Jesus when she was three.  No harm done and she now laughs about it, but we did opt for Jewish day school up until high school and we did pull her out of that preschool after a year to a preschool that did not push any religion.  In high school she was prepared to advocate for herself as needed because yes, it was definitely needed.", "ESH. I am also a Jew. I think what you need to understand is that being required to participate in the singing of religious songs is really offensive to religious minorities. It doesn't matter the age, if it's not a religiously affiliated school, it's not okay. Your wife still shouldn't have pulled your kid and put the onus on you to watch him while you work.\n\nI do wonder how your wife really feels about celebrating Christmas and if you and she talked about how that will play out. Is she only opposed to the religious aspects of Christmas, but is fine with celebrating and embracing the secular traditions, like non-religious carols, trees, presents, Santa? This needs to be a discussion. I have a Jewish friend with two young kids, and her husband was raised Catholic but not practicing. They've also had to hash this out. The kids are being raised Jewish, but they do secular Christmas because the traditions are important to her husband. Her in-laws try to sneak religious things in like advent calendars, and they have to shut it down together. You two need to be on the same page about these things.", "ESH\n\nYou both need to get on the same page here about how you are going to raise your kid in regards to religion. This will turn into a huge festering wound in your marriage if you don't.", "For those saying the Nursery School should not be singing Christmas songs, I think it depends where you are..  In the US only public schools are prohibited from having religion, and many nursery schools are actually affiliated with churches.  Where I live, there are s number of synagogues that also offer nursery or preschool.\n\nDaycares are different...but they are privately owned, and can do whatever they want...many do all the holidays...", "Idk if anyone is an asshole per se here but as a Christian, away in a manger is def explicitly religious & idk why they have small kids singing these songs in a presumably secular pre school?", "Mixed feelings. \n\nI know it\u2019s not the same thing but my wife is Catholic and I\u2019m an atheist. We agreed to raise our kids catholic because it was important to her but this required a lot of talk, understanding, and compromise. \n\nThis feels a bit on both sides. If she\u2019s that invested in Jewish beliefs, it\u2019s kind of her responsibility to get you to understand them. If you care about her, it\u2019s your responsibility to learn. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be hard. Having a kid in a house with strong religious points of view in opposite directions can be a real strain on the relationship if the too people involved can\u2019t see the other side.", "You're both being a bit over the top, but your wife is right about one thing. Nothing worms into the subconscious of a child like religion. \n\nI'm surprised the preschool wouldn't stick to the less overtly religious songs like Jingle Bells and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.", "Like yourself, I'm not religious. Went to Catholic school from kindergarten to 8th grade, had spiritual parents until one was blessed and became Catholic. We just won't get it.\n\nIt's a faith and ideology that you'll never get until you get it. She is Jewish and her faith seems very important to her. This includes the history of the Jewish people and the current climate the world is in, so I understand where she is coming from. But that doesn't excuse her taking y'all's child out of school early and leave him home with you to take care of while working. So I'm going to have to say NTA.\n\nWith that said, if she feels that strongly about the holiday, then you guys may need to look into a private Jewish school. And I'm basing this on your post that this is America. America has a very strong Christian bias, due to the politics here, so there's very little escaping it unless you guys are willing to pay for it.", "I'm not religious. I don't like Christmas, but tolerate it. It's not the same, but my elementary public school (grade 1-3 specifically) was teaching us the common christian prayer (not sure what it's called) and I had no clue what we were saying or the importance. Then, other classmates were saying they were Catholic or something else and I got very confused because I didn't understand what they were talking about. I asked my mother what we were and she snapped at me \"nothing! We are nothing.\" I understood later on in life it was because she was raised Jehovah Witness and married dad to get out and away from it. She had Religious trauma. At home, she wanted nothing to do with it and avoided religion as much as possible. But the school was teaching me prayer regardless and it impacted her attempts to keep it away.\n\nThe point of the story is, yes, he's three, but he may begin questioning what to believe sooner than you expect. What he absorbs now in nursery will impact his Jewish teachings and understanding later. That's what your wife is worried about I would imagine. I don't blame her for being upset about it. But you both need to sit down and agree to a solution to the problem instead of brushing off each other's feelings and trying to assert dominance over how to handle it.\n\nI'll say ESH. Wife can't bring him home when you need to work, and you're brushing off her concerns. You both need to talk to each other and actively listen to each other. Hopefully my childhood story helps shed some light on how this could affect him later, but if not then sorry for the long, unnecessary story.", "ESH.  You were dismissive of her concerns.  You essentially blew her off.  She has actually compromised by agreeing to celebrate Christmas.  And I\u2019m sure she was thinking any celebrations would be completely secular\u2026you know, snowmen and candy canes, Deck the Halls and Jingle Bells\u2026without any of the religious overtones.  What she got blind-sided with was Away in a Manger and God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.  For someone who is religious but non-Christian, this has to be deeply disturbing.  It\u2019s not what she agreed to.  And yes, it seriously is that serious to her.\n\nHer pulling him out of school (which I actually get, given her concerns) and dumping him on you was an AH move.  Because you\u2019re right\u2026if this is that important to her, she should have been the one to take the time off.  I get what she was thinking\u2026she wanted to slam home just how serious this is to her.  I just don\u2019t think it was all that productive in terms of finding a solution.  And it wasn\u2019t, was it.  You\u2019ve been fighting about it instead of working toward finding a long term solution.\n\nAnd finding a long-term solution is imperative.  In a few months, Easter is going to roll around.  You need to a solution that she can be comfortable with since you don\u2019t really have any concerns about it.", "Soft YTA- I know you don\u2019t mean any harm, but acknowledging Jesus Christ is super blasphemous to the Jewish faith, and considering how standard Christmas is and how overlooked the Jewish faith is, you have to understand how every little bit of Christian influence is going to really hurt your wife. I would really implore you to look into Jewish daycares and even reconsider celebrating Christmas, if your son is going to be raised Jewish.\n\nYou have no right to tell her something involving her religious beliefs are \u201cno big deal\u201d because that\u2019s not for you to say", "Soft YTA, and I say soft because most non-Jews don\u2019t realize what the ubiquity of Christmas means to Jews and how threatening it feels. This is clear from the comments here.\n\nChristmas is a hegemon. It takes over everything. Any majority culture does, but especially Christmas. When you are a minority culture, you have to foster that very very carefully. I would personally be upset that the daycare was playing Christmas music at all.\n\nMy last ex was not Jewish and didn\u2019t realize why I hated Christmas and didn\u2019t want it in our home. Many Jews grow up feeling very in touch with the threat of Christmas, the creep of Christianity, and how alienating it is. We also wind up feeling very protective of our traditions. I don\u2019t care if I have a Jewish partner, but I want to raise my kids Jewish and there will be no Christmas in my home. My partner is on board with that. But I know that it\u2019s hard to understand to a non-Jew.", "YTA. I used to be like you. For me, Christmas was just a secular holiday, and I figured no one could reasonably be bothered by a little bit of Christmas in a school setting. After all, Christmas is just cultural, right? I didn't believe in Jesus, and I still celebrated Christmas, so everyone must be as comfortable with it as I was. And then I converted to Judaism, and I was suddenly very struck by the difference between _not believing_ in something and _disbelieving_ in something. I didn't want to celebrate Christmas anymore, because I specifically _disbelieved_ the Christmas story. And when people insisted that I should be comfortable with a holiday that now felt like a burlap sack, I just wanted (and want) them to accept my right to _not_ have Christmas shoved in my life.\n\nYour wife is right: The early exposure to Christmas sets a precedent. It's already doing it, because it's revealing how your experience with Christmas is different from hers, and how you don't feel the very real and valid discomfort that she feels. And if you continue to disregard why this version of Christmas feels like an intrusion to her (especially when she's already willing to compromise enough to allow for secular Christmas in your family!), you will continue to be a part of forcing Christianity (however unintentionally) on your family. It's really important that you actually spend some time trying to understand why this feels like such a violation to your wife.\n\nThe daycare also sucks, by the way. If it's not a Christian daycare, the available options should go beyond \"let us force Christmas on your kid or don't bring your kid at all.\"", "Unless he lives under a rock, he's going to hear all of those songs eventually.  \nI'm atheist and one of my favorite songs is Amazing Grace. I just think it's a beautiful song.  \nYour wife is being over the top. The world has religious songs, churches everywhere, religious people. He will be around them, whether she likes it or not.  \n\n\nHaving said all of that, I don't think they should teach anything religious in school. Unless it's a school particularly for that, such as a catholic school.  \nThere are plenty of Christmas songs that are not religious: Jingle Bell Rock, etc.", "NTA. As an Atheist raised by Atheists (mom was raised Catholic, dad was raised Jewish) who grew up celebrating holidays from both backgrounds, I guarantee you that singing Christmas songs about Jesus in school did not in any way change my belief (or lack there of) in Jesus. Your wife is overreacting.", "NTA-I\u2019m an atheist who celebrates Christmas too and you\u2019re not going to be able to avoid it. You could ask the school to stick to less Jesus-heavy songs like Jingle Bells instead. Taking the kid out of class is going to cause issues and he will miss out. Usually you only see that with Jehovah\u2019s Witness kids.", "Honestly I grew up hearing those songs on the radio and I didn't grow up religious. I just thought the song was pretty. It didn't make me believe in the songs character anymore than Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer made me believe a Reindeer had a light up nose and flew through the air. The kid won't remember the song in a few weeks.", "ESH\n\nYou - if you're an atheist and you agreed to raise the kid in the Jewish faith, then when your wife decides something doesn't work with that faith, you shut up and help her work it out.  Plus, you didn't define what celebrating Christmas was for you and/or you are modifying that definition - so, not full disclosure to your wife.\n\nWife - If she agreed to celebrating Christmas, she should have assumed that the holiday would have to be explained in some way and that should have been defined.  Plus, the kid is going to hear them, so her \"seeps in\" argument is void.  Better to have on going discussions about what you as a family believe and that other people believe different things.  And that some participation in other's beliefs is ok as a show of respect/inclusion/understanding etc. and how to differentiate between sharing and disrespecting your own religion.  This is one of those areas where its a bit easier because a) Jesus was a Jew, b) even without the messiah/son of god components was a good man/leader worthy of celebration.  This whole you have to be x to take part in x's celebrations is why x and y can't get along.\n\nDaycare - woah, these people are AH's.  That was their response?  That's way biased and/or we don't care.  What happens when Easter rolls around?  And are they this blase about allergies?  I'd start looking for a new one.", "NAH.

What part of it was she planning to celebrate? \n\nThat said, if it makes her uncomfortable and means that much to her, I'd go with that, especially since you don't have any strong feelings about needing to sing those songs anyway.", "Nah, but you need to find a new daycare.   She is right,  this shouldn\u2019t be allowed-  perhaps if they had a mix of songs.

We certainly didn\u2019t have to shut it down. But we were NOT to be the ones bringing it up. You should be a part of the conversation with your wife and the school.

They've been doing Christmas crafts and learning carols. On Friday he started singing \"away in a manger\". She was uncomfortable and asked what other songs they sing. He couldn't list any, but she asked for a list on Monday and got one. Theres a couple \"Jesus\" songs, basically. \n\nShe was pretty upset when we sat down for dinner. I told her it was no big deal. He doesn't suddenly believe Jesus was the messiah because he sang about a shiny star. He's three.\n\nShe argued that its setting up a precedent, its worming into his subconscious. I told her she was being dramatic. Like half of his class is muslim and they are also taking part. It's just music.\n\nShe got pretty upset, said it was different and that she \"didn't expect\" me to get it. On Tuesday she spoke to the nursery nurses and told them she didn't want him to partake. They said they didn't have that option but she was free to take him out until after Christmas. \n\nShe brought him home, to me, who works from home. I took him back. It's seriously not that serious. \n\nI told her she could take the time off work if she desperately doesn't want him there, but he already knows the songs so whats the point? Friday is his last day anyway.\n\nShe made a fuss this morning about having it noted in hia chart following that they need to make accommodation for him when celebrating religion. \n\nWe've been fighting for a while over it. Everyone we know is evenly split - some think she's dramatic, some think I'm an asshole for making such a deal out of something that clearly means a lot to her.
