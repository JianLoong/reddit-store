The name in question was Meadow. My sister found it awful and trashy. She was promptly shut down by our uncle.\n\nMy sister's friends all know what she's like but they have a different taste in names. Some of the names are Hayden, Indigo, Darcy, Brynn and Kaia.

And it was last month when she was meeting him for the first time (he was a few weeks old) that she started complaining about his name and I shut her down. Then she told me how awful it was that I let her find out his name via Instagram. She said she never expected to find out the name of her only nephew that way and I told her that I didn't want to hear her criticisms of the name. She then whined that nobody close to her ever tells her their baby names. Her best friend not telling her directly hurt her the most. She has two kids and my sister found out both their names on Facebook. She was like I don't get it, nobody seems to care about my feelings, etc.\n\nI told my sister that people might tell her more things if she wasn't so judgmental. I told her I would have told her if I hadn't known she'd despise my son's name and judge my husband and I for picking it.

Having a 'professional' name is a really overrated concept to me...I think it's more effective to work on just giving your kid the capacity to feel pride about their personal identity (of which the name is a part) and then that helps them develop into a successful professional of their choice. A classic name is not really going to help someone who was never secure in themselves get an office job.\n\nAnd that's not even to touch the idea that \"does it sound professional\" is a concept that is kind of steeped in bias towards 'classic' (western, English, etc.) names and has been shown to be an extension of existing biases. \n\nAt the end of the day your kid is a whole person who you get to love and grow with and parent, not just a future worker. Their name should reflect the values and aspirations and love you have for them across their whole life. And that will be different to everyone, which is fine.
