She always finds out via a social media post like the rest of the people in their lives who are not family. I also didn't tell her what my son's name would be directly. She found out via an Instagram post I made.\n\nMy sister has a problem with being super judgmental. Names are not the only thing she's like that about but she's the most vocal I would say.

The name in question was Meadow. My sister found it awful and trashy. She was promptly shut down by our uncle.\n\nMy sister's friends all know what she's like but they have a different taste in names. Some of the names are Hayden, Indigo, Darcy, Brynn and Kaia.

And it was last month when she was meeting him for the first time (he was a few weeks old) that she started complaining about his name and I shut her down. Then she told me how awful it was that I let her find out his name via Instagram. She said she never expected to find out the name of her only nephew that way and I told her that I didn't want to hear her criticisms of the name. She then whined that nobody close to her ever tells her their baby names. Her best friend not telling her directly hurt her the most. She has two kids and my sister found out both their names on Facebook. She was like I don't get it, nobody seems to care about my feelings, etc.\n\nI told my sister that people might tell her more things if she wasn't so judgmental. I told her I would have told her if I hadn't known she'd despise my son's name and judge my husband and I for picking it. My sister got defensive and said people are naming their kids such dumb things together.

(A lot of people hate their name, even those with names considered respectable or whatever). Thankfully, most schools will respect a person's identity, even if they are a minor, and call the kid the name they choose. What is even better, they can choose a name at 10 and change it again at 20. 10 year olds are terrible at naming themselves, (looking at you Prism).", "It's the opposite where I went to school. The more unusual names or nature names were seen as so cool while some of the more common names were teased. Really any name can be bullied.", "It's not so I can be unique.

That just makes me think of one of the grandparents from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.", "I think this is the right thought process OP. Having a 'professional' name is a really overrated concept to me...I think it's more effective to work on just giving your kid the capacity to feel pride about their personal identity (of which the name is a part) and then that helps them develop into a successful professional of their choice. A classic name is not really going to help someone who was never secure in themselves get an office job.\n\nAnd that's not even to touch the idea that \"does it sound professional\" is a concept that is kind of steeped in bias towards 'classic' (western, English, etc.) names and has been shown to be an extension of existing biases. \n\nAt the end of the day your kid is a whole person who you get to love and grow with and parent, not just a future worker. Their name should reflect the values and aspirations and love you have for them across their whole life. And that will be different to everyone, which is fine. I think your son will grow up to love the name because you've clearly put thought and care into it and the attitude in your comments is clearly showing him that it's something special but not the end all be all. You have a good approach", "Classic baby names are becoming super trendy. There are going to be full preschool classes that sound like they are characters from a Bridgerton spin-off. Meadow, Briar and Sage will be in the Waldorf preschool.\n\nEditing to add;\n\nI think there are a couple things going on with the trends. One is a trend towards having gender neutral options. Nature names are usually gender neutral on their own and names like Josephine get shortened to Jo.\n\nThere is also a trend towards childish nicknames so a parent may start with a nickname they like and then choose a classic name for options later.  A Sunny might be Susanna on their birth certificate.", "You are delusional lol. Unless you live in a ghetto tier school district your son is gonna be bullied endlessly. Hes gonna resent the fuck out of this name. Comparing Sonny with Sunny is pretty funny aswell. But both are white trash names obviously. \n\nSunny for a son... yikes.", "It must be a regional thing then. Where I\u2019m from in London we hear European, African and Asian names so often noone batters an eye, the names that you listed your friends picked sound like someone picked them out of a dictionary at random.", "Yea sorry this is massive cope.\n\nHes gonna have a tough time and its because you want to be special. It honestly sucks you are so defensive about an obvious mistake. Yea YTA and so is your sister.\n\nJust did a room check out of 45 people in the office 44 think sunny is ridiculous name for a boy and 15 think its ridiculous for a girl. And all 3 hiring managers would believe its a joke resum\u00e9.", "Oh my god zoomer????? WTH!!!!!!!", "She couldn't believe I liked the name Milo for one of our cousins babies.", "Thank you so much. I 100% agree with you. I have known people of other cultures/races have trouble because their names were traditional where they were from but considered \"made up\" or \"trashy\" or \"weird\" by American/Western standards. It's a slippery slope to say only \"classic\" names are usable as adults because are you talking about classic names worldwide or classic western names.", "Classic baby names are always trendy, it's just that what counts as \"classic\" changes.", "They're the same name spelled differently.\n\nAnd not a ghetto tier school. We just found names that were different cool. Some of us were even jealous of kids who had fun names.", "It totally is. Sonny is actually a pretty popular boys name in the UK according to the rankings of the name. In the US it wasn't as popular but has been growing and so has the name with the spelling Sunny.\n\nI went to school with an Indigo who went by Indie. My friends and I thought her name was so cool lol.", "And I personally think that's wrong. People should not be judged on their names. I believe we'd all be better off if people were more open to names from everywhere. In the end names from other cultures get judged harshly. Names that sound too weird to some are judged. Perfectly great names get judged for one reason or another.\n\nSunny is not an offensive name and it's not even weird. It's easy to spell and say and to me, it has a lovely warmth to it that I think fits my son beautifully. Not everyone will agree and that's fine.", "Yeah ,it's this one\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15go2jh/aita_for_rude_and_dismissive_about_all_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1", "Milo is a lovely name. What exactly was wrong with it? So basically if it's not an old lady/man name she doesn't like it. That's ridiculous \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude12", "I think of classic names as those that have consistently been used over many generations. They may always be somewhere on the charts but at times trend and shoot up towards the top.", "Fair enough, I\u2019m yet to meet a Sonny but there\u2019s bound to be some out there.", "> And I personally think that's wrong.\n\nYea but this is the real world. I think everyone should be named whatever they want love who they want and no one should bully. But thats never gonna happen because human gonna human. Your childish view of the world is mindblowing.\n\n\nSunny is a ridiculous name for a boy. Its not up for debate lol. It simply is most sane people will agree. Maybe this will change, but thats not really relevant to the situation at hand.\n\nIf you think a female sounding name together with guaranteed bullying fits your son perfectly then idk what to tell you.\n\nDont be surprised if he hates the name due it sounding girly together with the bullying or you have to constantly fix his gender.  when they mess it up. Either way he'll spend the rest of his life with this bs. Wouldve been better to call him Sunray so he couldve ran with Ray.", "Thank you", "Yes, but the names that trend upwards are pretty consistent - they're names one generation older than what the parents consider \"old person names\".\n\nAnd those names from Great-Grandma's generation are always in style... even though whatever generation that actually *is* changes from decade to decade.", "I think we are talking about two different things or talking across each other, or whatever. \n\nWhat I am trying to say, classic names are classic names whether they are trending or not. Being a name used by great grandparents doesn't automatically make a name classic though some are. Being used consistently over generations would be a classic name by my definition."]}
