She's had three of her closest friends have babies in the last five years and none of them told her directly (via text, DM or in person) what the name is. She always finds out via a social media post like the rest of the people in their lives who are not family. I also didn't tell her what my son's name would be directly. She found out via an Instagram post I made.\n\nMy sister has a problem with being super judgmental. Names are not the only thing she's like that about but she's the most vocal I would say. She has always labelled people bad parents over what they name their kids if *she* doesn't like it. I remember when she was like 20 and one of our aunts had a baby after 20 years of trying (she was mid-forties having her baby) and my sister told her after all those years of waiting she should have named her baby something better because she was already off to a \"rough start\". The name in question was Meadow. My sister found it awful and trashy. She was promptly shut down by our uncle.\n\nMy sister's friends all know what she's like but they have a different taste in names. Some of the names are Hayden, Indigo, Darcy, Brynn and Kaia. These are all names my sister would insult or claim are setting kids up for failure. She named her own kids Elizabeth, Josephine and William and my sister mostly expects others to give their kids names in a similar style.\n\nMy sister also hates my son's name, Sunny. And it was last month when she was meeting him for the first time (he was a few weeks old) that she started complaining about his name and I shut her down. Then she told me how awful it was that I let her find out his name via Instagram. She said she never expected to find out the name of her only nephew that way and I told her that I didn't want to hear her criticisms of the name. She then whined that nobody close to her ever tells her their baby names. Her best friend not telling her directly hurt her the most. She has two kids and my sister found out both their names on Facebook. She was like I don't get it, nobody seems to care about my feelings, etc.\n\nI told my sister that people might tell her more things if she wasn't so judgmental. I told her I would have told her if I hadn't known she'd despise my son's name and judge my husband and I for picking it. My sister got defensive and said people are naming their kids such dumb things together. I told her she might think they're dumb but not everyone will and she hurts people's feelings by people so harsh. She told me I was judging her and being cruel and expected me to apologize for what I said.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692781715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yycpx/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_people_might_tell/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If not directly asked what you think of something just STFU.   \nAnd if someone asks you opinion you can be honest and say: \"It is not a name I would have picked for my child, but I am glad you and your husband found one that you liked.\" for example. It is still honest, but far less rude.", "Aside from Indigo and Sunny, the names  do kind of blend in with current trends. The sister's as well. \n\nIndigo used to have negative associations and was avoided as a name. There was some woo woo movement that labeled neurodivergent children as indigo children. They thought they were more highly evolved with supernatural abilities or something. Really just parents in denial. I don't know if it is still a thing that is widely known so Indigo may be fine. \n\nSunny doesn't seem to be on trend but is probably fine as well. It is a bit like naming a kid Junior or Bubba but kids probably won't care enough to bully just because of the name. They may find reasons outside of a name to bully any kid or just make up a reason. Kids are assholes. \n\nPeople need to relax a bit with names. It feels like most people go by a nickname anyway and it is becoming pretty acceptable to change your name if it doesn't fit who you are as you grow.", "Oh come on, Brynn is easily the worst.", "You saw all of the NTA votes and still decided to do pretty much the same thing as the sister in this thread?", "I happen to think they're all lovely name.

Especially as a teenager I would have hated that name if my parents had named me that.", "Maybe instead of asking yourself, ask sister if she thinks people want to hear her hurtful opinion. Just like she didn\u2019t want to hear your \u201churtful\u201d comment.

I'm well aware my opinion is irrelevant.", "To be fair some of the names I like the *idea* of, but I'm just imagining what it would be like going through school with those names. Sunny is a nice name, it's just not a nice name to grow up with.", "She has never asked people what they think of her kids names. By default she believes everyone loves them.", "It may be a cultural or regional difference, but over here the names \"Elizabeth\" and \"Josephine\" (Or rather their local equivalents here) would be considered archaic. \n\nI would actually be more concerned for a child named \"Josephine\" than one named \"Sunny\" or \"Meadow\" during school years just because of how old-fashioned their names would be.", "OP I my husband and I had our children when I was 17 and 18. The names we picked were pretty unique for both the place we lived in and the time of 20+ years ago. I'm more than positive that a lot of people from both sides of the families weren't too thrilled with the names, but they kept their mouths shut and said the names were unusual but nice, and as long as we liked them that was all that mattered. This is pretty much the worst thing that your sister should be commenting. Personally I think her kids names are boring and ugly as hell, I'm sure she wouldn't like to be told that either. She needs to shut up and just smile and be enthusiastic about any names that people name their kids. ( unless it's something really stupid like \"Zoomer\". Heard that one on a post a few days ago and spit out my drink laughing lol \ud83e\udd23 )"]}
