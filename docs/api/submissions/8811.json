Shit turned sour in 2020 when I became jobless after having to homeschool our kids. Couldn't afford the rent. We got evicted 6 months later. My MIL, who offered us two bedrooms, backed out as soon as we became homeless and we ended up living out of our van for 4 months with our kids before a homeless shelter opened up. During said time MIL had very little contact with us. SIL was also tense from us asking to come to her house to shower, despite us offering payment. We were looked at like we were scum because we were over the age of 30, had 3 kids and didn't have our shit together. We were told how we were going about life all wrong and that if we had planned better we wouldn't be in the situation. Coming from SIL mostly, who was given her house after her father died and hadn't paid taxes in 4 years. \n\nFast forward, we were able to get back in our feet times ten. We built a house from scratch with our kids and gained a shit ton of experience for all of us. It came out perfect. The kids are ecstatic because they built their own house. We are happier than ever. We even started our own business. We did this together, without help from any of his family despite their promises and I will admit that I grew a nasty taste in my mouth about the whole lot of them, despite the end result turning out the way it did.\n\nWell, MIL is down and out currently. She was moved to PT employment due to her slow paced work style, her retirement was taken away apparently after the government stripped it from them and will likely be evicted soon, as she has already received two notices and a lease termination letter. She came here yesterday afternoon and asked us if she could stay here if she became evicted. I will admit that my first reaction was to outright laugh at her and her audacity. She looked immediately offended and uncomfortable, especially after I stated there wasn't a chance of that happening. My husband just stood beside me with his arms crossed, glaring at his mother- as he is very resentful of her allowing her grandchildren to live out of a van and homeless shelter after promises had already been made. Anyways, she left crying after saying the situation was entirely different. SIL however called us later and said that we were \"fucking trash\" for not allowing her soon to be evicted, elderly mother to move in. My only response was that a nursing home just opened up down the street and she can go there. However, a few friends say it was kind of mean.

Let the SIL take her.", "NTA", "NTA.  This is not an entirely different situation. This is the exact same situation you were in.  SIL can be the one to take her in if she's that upset.", "INFO\n\n>Shit turned sour in 2020 when I became jobless after having to homeschool our kids. \n\nSo the chain of events is:\n\n1. Had to homeschool your kids\n\n2. Quit job to homeschool kids\n\n3. Got evicted for having no job\n\n\nNormally it would probably not be appropriate to ask why you needed to homeschool your kids, but it seems like an import piece of the chain here.\n\nQuitting your job to homeschool your kids when it means being unable to afford your rent means some bad financial planning leading your kids to being homeless. Unless there is some reason homeschooling them immediately was more important than them having a home I would say either YTA or everyone sucks.\n\nSkipped details around quitting your job when you could not afford to makes me wonder if there aren't also details missing about why MIL retracted her offer. Also trying to paint SIL as AHish for not being ecstatic that a family of five was sharing her shower is a little weird.\n\nEdit: One more question. SIL inherited a house, did your husband not inherit anything?", "Dude. DO you not remember what happened in 2020? Schools closed. All parents had to juggle our jobs AND providing full-time childcare, and many of us were let go because of it.", "Uh, you know, the thing with the coronavirus? That thing?\n\nSchool doesn\u2019t just teach them, it also minds them for several hours a day.", "Um. COVID happened in 2020. Schools closed, lockdowns happened. Many many many people lost their jobs because their children had no school to go to.", "Different dad's. She inherited HER father's house. And do you not recall everything closing in 2020? Everyone has to homeschool their children.", "First of all, good for you for managing to turn a bad situation around. It's not easy.  Secondly, you are definitely NTA. When I ended up divorced with 2 young kids I never worried that my parents would leave me high and dry. I would have walked across hot coals for them.  You don't forget who was there to lift you up in your lowest moments and you also don't forget who kicked you when you were down.", "NTA.  What's the golden rule? Treat others how you would want others to treat you, right? Sounds like you're just reciprocating her behaviour. Karma's a bitch", "This is what we call karma.\n\nAnd I'm Indian, so you know it's true ;)\n\nNTA, and well done.", "Nta! She's right. The situation is different! You had children to provide for. Which takes extra money, and means their decision punished not nly the adults, but three innocent children! She's an adult and has no dependents; who is now being forced to face the consequences of her own actions. Not just against you,  but more importantly against her innocent grandchildren who she punished to make a point. When there really shouldn't have been one to make. Not everything can be prepared for, looks like it's her turn to learn that lesson. Give her the address to a homeless shelter and a nursing home and call it a day. She doesn't deserve to be near your home or your children. If sil has an issue with it she can take her in.", "NTA. Why doesn\u2019t SIL take her?", "NTA. What goes around, comes around. She is this old and doesn't have her shit together?? Not your problem. SIL can keep her or let her shower in her house.", "NTA let her stay with her daughter since she has such a strong opinion and cares so much about her mom being homeless", "NTA", "NTA! Your MIL turned her back on you and then when you were at your lowest, repeatedly kicked sand in your face (metaphorically of course). The fact that you even allowed her in your home for a visit is big of you. Also your SIL can help her then she feels so high and mighty about it.", "NTA. I wouldn't have been able to look at her after refusing to house your kids. She can go live with SIL.", "Wow wow wow.  NTA.  Congratulations on lifting yourselves up out of the rough situation.  What goes around, comes around.  Don't waste your time and effort on people who do nothing to deserve it.", "Well if you\u2019re a \u201c fucking trash\u201d then why is sil wanting her mother to live with the so called trash?! Why not let her mom live with her. Problem solved. Laugh more op cause you deserve it.  NTA", "INFO: Wasn\u2019t there like a 2 year moratorium on evictions? How were you evicted?", "NTA\n\nMaybe MIL should have \"planned better so she wouldn't be in the situation\"", "NTA I hope you laugh every time they bring it up", "It was kinda mean to say that but oh so appropriate. NTA", "NTA.  If your SIL is so worried she can clearly open her home to her mother.  The audacity of ppl.  I\u2019d go no contact with all of them, they sound awful", "NTA Let SIL take her in", "Laugh again. You earned it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. While it may have been a bit mean to laugh at your MIL, it is totally understandable given how she treated you and your family.", "Yeah it does sound different. Your situation was caused by a global pandemic and is entirely understandable. Your MILs seems to be more caused by her poor work ethic\u2026 Also, you haven\u2019t gone back on a promise making children homeless. So yes different but not in a way that helps MIL", "NTA but why didn\u2019t SIL offer for her sweet old mommy to stay with her ??? but has the audacity to call you \u201cfucking trash\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 love when karma comes back hard asffff", "NTA. But I would have been like \u201coh of course\u201d and then as soon as she showed up on my doorstep with bags serve her with a restraining order and tell her she has 30 seconds to vacate the premises or I\u2019m calling the cops for violation of the order", "She is clearly just not going about life the right way. She\u2019ll pull her self up by her bootstraps I\u2019m sure.", "\"SIL it's clear you care very deeply about MIL being homeless, so I'll let her know she obviously has a free room at your house, bless your heart!\"", "The odds are very high that MIL asked SIL first and was shot down. (Not 100%, but still high.)\n\nOP- NTA", "She thinks she has valid, sympathetic reasons for being in a fix and OP and her family didn't - she simply assumed their problems were due to mistakes she would never have made.  \n\nIt's kind of satisfying when the \"just world\" fallacy comes back around to bite someone in the bum.", "Wasn\u2019t even mean under the circumstances.", "Did you just forget we had a pandemic and everything closed?", "Your kids' school didn't switch to online? I'm just trying to make sense of this. \ud83e\udd14", "You do realize someone had to stay home with the kids even if they switched to online? And that even with online classes many parents had to still help with schooling more than they did prior to the pandemic and lockdown? Or did you also forget about the what we've all gone through and are still going through with the current pandemic that everyone seemingly has amnesia about? I'm just trying to make sense of this."]}
