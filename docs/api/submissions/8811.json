Shit turned sour in 2020 when I became jobless after having to homeschool our kids. Couldn't afford the rent. We got evicted 6 months later. My MIL, who offered us two bedrooms, backed out as soon as we became homeless and we ended up living out of our van for 4 months with our kids before a homeless shelter opened up. During said time MIL had very little contact with us. SIL was also tense from us asking to come to her house to shower, despite us offering payment. We were looked at like we were scum because we were over the age of 30, had 3 kids and didn't have our shit together. We were told how we were going about life all wrong and that if we had planned better we wouldn't be in the situation. Coming from SIL mostly, who was given her house after her father died and hadn't paid taxes in 4 years. \n\nFast forward, we were able to get back in our feet times ten. We built a house from scratch with our kids and gained a shit ton of experience for all of us. It came out perfect. The kids are ecstatic because they built their own house. We are happier than ever. We even started our own business. We did this together, without help from any of his family despite their promises and I will admit that I grew a nasty taste in my mouth about the whole lot of them, despite the end result turning out the way it did.\n\nWell, MIL is down and out currently. She was moved to PT employment due to her slow paced work style, her retirement was taken away apparently after the government stripped it from them and will likely be evicted soon, as she has already received two notices and a lease termination letter. She came here yesterday afternoon and asked us if she could stay here if she became evicted. I will admit that my first reaction was to outright laugh at her and her audacity. She looked immediately offended and uncomfortable, especially after I stated there wasn't a chance of that happening. My husband just stood beside me with his arms crossed, glaring at his mother- as he is very resentful of her allowing her grandchildren to live out of a van and homeless shelter after promises had already been made. Anyways, she left crying after saying the situation was entirely different. SIL however called us later and said that we were \"fucking trash\" for not allowing her soon to be evicted, elderly mother to move in. My only response was that a nursing home just opened up down the street and she can go there. However, a few friends say it was kind of mean.

Because you going from being financially well off to then be homeless after 6 months when you were homeschooling your kids sounds off to me. \n\nThis whole story sounds messed up. No judgement until I hear more details.", "Nta. I can\u2019t imagine a grandmother letting her three grandchildren go homeless, what a terrible woman she must be. Maybe I would help just to show her I am better than her, but I also get your position.", "NTA. One bad turn doesn\u2019t necessarily deserve another but this seems like sweet sweet karma.", "NTA - karma is real.", "Strong NTA! SIL was quick to judge so let the SIL with the \"FREE\" house give her a place to live.", "If you went homeless in 6 months of not working, you were never well off. You were doing ok, but far from well off!", "NTA Your SIL is f\\*\\*king trash and MIL gets what she deserves", "YTA- from homeless to minted with your home and business- \n\nYour mil went from loaded to poor", "NTA. \n\nYou got to see karma at work \n\nIDC what anyone says, thats a joyous moment", "YTA....\n\nBut in the best way possible! That laughter must've been delicious \ud83d\ude09", "What goes around, comes around. SIL can handle it just fine if she's so concerned about it. Family relationships are two way, if that isn't the case, they're not family. You are not the AH.", "NTA. Fuck her. Karma sucks.", "NTA\n\nThough this might change based on what caused MIL to back out of the offer of 2 bed rooms and what MIL's argument is that it is different.", "NTA", "NTA. If SIL is so worried about the situation HER OWN MOTHER is in. She can take her in. \n\nYou don't own anybody anything after they all treated you that way. \n\nOh and your friends apparently want to offer up their home, seeing as how sad they find the whole situation.", "op=NTA\n\nSIL can take her in since she and MIL know how to maintain their lives so well.\n\nI would have laughed too, from surprise at the sheer audacity of her.", "NTA, I'm sure SIL has room to take her in if she's so upset about it.", "NTA  SIL can take her in if she's so concerned.", "Sounds like the SIL is offering to take her in then if she wants to say your trash for not. She can take her then", "NTA. I would\u2019ve done the same, I can\u2019t believe she expected you to house her after what she did", "Karmas a bitch grandma. \n\nNTA", "Nta, screw that entitlement", "Talk about making your made and laying in it\u2026 where was she when you guys needed help or the SIL? Well that\u2019s not your problem and she can always go and stay with the SIL", "NTA. Actions have consequences.\n\nShe found out what her consequences were when you told her no.", "Karma and FAFO had a baby and dropped it right on MIL just like she honestly deserves. I don\u2019t blame OP for laughing and would have added a GTFO and shut the door in her face cause I don\u2019t have the time or ability to tolerate people like her\n\nLet her live on the street and learn what she did to her own grandkids. She shouldn\u2019t get to see them again after this regardless cause they definitely need therapy to work through the issues of having their grandmother and aunt abandon them and treat them so poorly for something they in no way had control over\n\nNTA. OP should enjoy getting to be petty over this because it\u2019s the bare minimum of offense to show someone who broke a promise or lied about giving them a place to stay in support of a bad situation", "Yep. Couldn\u2019t stop rolling my eyes through the whole thing. Just got more and more unrealistic as they went on. \n\nMy favorite part was \u201cwe even started our own business\u201d added on like an afterthought. \n\nStep #1: poverty/homelessness \n\nStep #2: ???\n\nStep #3: new custom house!\n\nStep #4: our own business!\n\nStep #5: nobody question this!", "r/AmITheAsshole is just slice-of-life r/NoSleep: we all agree that this shit didn't happen, but we pretend like it did because we like the story.", "\ud83d\ude02 Priceless!", "Schools in a lot of areas shut completely apart for for a very tight list of essential workers. My colleagues with children were home schooling for about a year though our employer allowed WFH while schooling. School provided guidance and study packs but parents were the ones making sure work done.", "OP do you know how lucky you are? People rarely get to see karma in action.  Good for you!\nNTA", "This is the way.", "It is.  And there's the added fun of other companies holding liens as well.  It's not simple and does have risks.  My county is trying to pass a law against online tax sales to keep out of area bidders (corporations) from purchasing cheap properties and then raising rents to an insane amount", "If Americans took that risk into account our economy would collapse in 15-20 years. Our system is built off the idea that people don't take that into account.", "Then people should never have children then, because job loss, health issues, etc will always happen to someone.  So it is a possibility for everyone.", "True, but it is worse if you live just within your means than if you have some savings and your absolute need living expenses (as opposed to the luxuries) are below what one of the parents earns.", "YTA for still having a relationship with them. They don\u2019t deserve you.", "Agreed. This is one of those fantasy stories someone made up. Well off finacially in 2019 and homeless after covid? You were not well off then.\n\nThats not all. During covid you got your lives back together, then built a house, started a business in under 3 yrs. And now miraculously your MIL happens to be down on her luck and has to move in with OP? \n\nYou aren't going from homeless to opening a business. Then building a home from scratch in under 3 years. All with 3 kids during this time.", "Right.  That thinking miraculously never sees how she has made mistakes, etc.  Mom lost her job for her \u201cslow\u201d work style.  How did she rationalize that as not being something she could change. Yet she not only thinks her job loss was \u201cdifferent\u201d but she apparently has also decided that she cannot ever work anywhere else.", "I don't doubt that people go from well-off to homeless to well-off.\n\nBut not in that time frame unless they're doing something illegal.\n\nAnd to build a house in that time, with all the supply issues in 2020 and  2021?\n\nYeah, that's quite a fantasy.", "Millenials can't *afford* kids that's why birthrates are down."]}
