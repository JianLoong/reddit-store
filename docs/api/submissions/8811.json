Shit turned sour in 2020 when I became jobless after having to homeschool our kids. Couldn't afford the rent. We got evicted 6 months later. My MIL, who offered us two bedrooms, backed out as soon as we became homeless and we ended up living out of our van for 4 months with our kids before a homeless shelter opened up. During said time MIL had very little contact with us. SIL was also tense from us asking to come to her house to shower, despite us offering payment. We were looked at like we were scum because we were over the age of 30, had 3 kids and didn't have our shit together. We were told how we were going about life all wrong and that if we had planned better we wouldn't be in the situation. Coming from SIL mostly, who was given her house after her father died and hadn't paid taxes in 4 years. \n\nFast forward, we were able to get back in our feet times ten. We built a house from scratch with our kids and gained a shit ton of experience for all of us. It came out perfect. The kids are ecstatic because they built their own house. We are happier than ever. We even started our own business. We did this together, without help from any of his family despite their promises and I will admit that I grew a nasty taste in my mouth about the whole lot of them, despite the end result turning out the way it did.\n\nWell, MIL is down and out currently. She was moved to PT employment due to her slow paced work style, her retirement was taken away apparently after the government stripped it from them and will likely be evicted soon, as she has already received two notices and a lease termination letter. She came here yesterday afternoon and asked us if she could stay here if she became evicted. I will admit that my first reaction was to outright laugh at her and her audacity. She looked immediately offended and uncomfortable, especially after I stated there wasn't a chance of that happening. My husband just stood beside me with his arms crossed, glaring at his mother- as he is very resentful of her allowing her grandchildren to live out of a van and homeless shelter after promises had already been made. Anyways, she left crying after saying the situation was entirely different. SIL however called us later and said that we were \"fucking trash\" for not allowing her soon to be evicted, elderly mother to move in. My only response was that a nursing home just opened up down the street and she can go there. However, a few friends say it was kind of mean.

SIL can be the one to take her in if she's that upset.", "INFO\n\n>Shit turned sour in 2020 when I became jobless after having to homeschool our kids. \n\nSo the chain of events is:\n\n1. Had to homeschool your kids\n\n2. Quit job to homeschool kids\n\n3. Got evicted for having no job\n\n\nNormally it would probably not be appropriate to ask why you needed to homeschool your kids, but it seems like an import piece of the chain here.\n\nQuitting your job to homeschool your kids when it means being unable to afford your rent means some bad financial planning leading your kids to being homeless. Unless there is some reason homeschooling them immediately was more important than them having a home I would say either YTA or everyone sucks.\n\nSkipped details around quitting your job when you could not afford to makes me wonder if there aren't also details missing about why MIL retracted her offer. Also trying to paint SIL as AHish for not being ecstatic that a family of five was sharing her shower is a little weird.\n\nEdit: One more question. SIL inherited a house, did your husband not inherit anything?", "Dude. DO you not remember what happened in 2020? Schools closed. All parents had to juggle our jobs AND providing full-time childcare, and many of us were let go because of it.", "Uh, you know, the thing with the coronavirus? That thing?\n\nSchool doesn\u2019t just teach them, it also minds them for several hours a day.", "Um. COVID happened in 2020. Schools closed, lockdowns happened. Many many many people lost their jobs because their children had no school to go to.", "Different dad's. She inherited HER father's house. And do you not recall everything closing in 2020? Everyone has to homeschool their children.", "First of all, good for you for managing to turn a bad situation around. It's not easy.  Secondly, you are definitely NTA. When I ended up divorced with 2 young kids I never worried that my parents would leave me high and dry. I would have walked across hot coals for them.  You don't forget who was there to lift you up in your lowest moments and you also don't forget who kicked you when you were down.", "NTA.  What's the golden rule? Treat others how you would want others to treat you, right? Sounds like you're just reciprocating her behaviour. Karma's a bitch", "This is what we call karma.\n\nAnd I'm Indian, so you know it's true ;)\n\nNTA, and well done.", "Nta! She's right. The situation is different! You had children to provide for. Which takes extra money, and means their decision punished not nly the adults, but three innocent children! She's an adult and has no dependents; who is now being forced to face the consequences of her own actions. Not just against you,  but more importantly against her innocent grandchildren who she punished to make a point. When there really shouldn't have been one to make. Not everything can be prepared for, looks like it's her turn to learn that lesson. Give her the address to a homeless shelter and a nursing home and call it a day. She doesn't deserve to be near your home or your children. If sil has an issue with it she can take her in.", "NTA. Why doesn\u2019t SIL take her?", "NTA. What goes around, comes around. She is this old and doesn't have her shit together?? Not your problem.

Your MIL turned her back on you and then when you were at your lowest, repeatedly kicked sand in your face (metaphorically of course).

I wouldn't have been able to look at her after refusing to house your kids. She can go live with SIL.", "Wow wow wow.  NTA.  Congratulations on lifting yourselves up out of the rough situation.  What goes around, comes around.  Don't waste your time and effort on people who do nothing to deserve it.", "Well if you\u2019re a \u201c fucking trash\u201d then why is sil wanting her mother to live with the so called trash?! Why not let her mom live with her. Problem solved. Laugh more op cause you deserve it.  NTA", "INFO: Wasn\u2019t there like a 2 year moratorium on evictions? How were you evicted?", "NTA\n\nMaybe MIL should have \"planned better so she wouldn't be in the situation\"", "NTA I hope you laugh every time they bring it up", "It was kinda mean to say that but oh so appropriate.

I\u2019d go no contact with all of them, they sound awful", "NTA Let SIL take her in", "Laugh again. You earned it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. While it may have been a bit mean to laugh at your MIL, it is totally understandable given how she treated you and your family.", "Yeah it does sound different. Your situation was caused by a global pandemic and is entirely understandable. Your MILs seems to be more caused by her poor work ethic\u2026 Also, you haven\u2019t gone back on a promise making children homeless.

She knowingly let her son and his family be homeless after arranging for you to stay with her. Where does she find the audacity to ask for help? What goes around, comes around.

I love a good story about someone who treated their family poorly until they needed help and were all shocked when they were treated the same. You can dish it, but you can\u2019t take it? Bit what goes around, comes around!", "NTA. What goes around comes around.", "NTA. You were kinder than I would be. NTA times 100. She didnt even care that you had three kids living in a van. Screw her. The situation is diffrent, she had no legit reason to not want to help you. You have valid reason not to help her.\n\nI cant even imagine this but I know its true. Makes me remember when I left my moms house with my husband and baby the day before Thanksgiving. I had the flu and had asked my mom if she cared if I just made my daughter soup and she cook dinner. (I did 99% of the cooking, paid rent, did all the laundry and used my foodstamps to pay for groceries so they didnt have to). She got mad and told me no i couldnt make nothing, kitchens closed. I said my baby needed to eat and she said \"not my problem\". So i walked downstairs, told my ex husband to help pack our shit and we were leaving. My mom cried, screamed, cussed out my husband and threw my stuff at me as i packed. We left within two hours and I didnt speak to her till she finally apologized. Which took about 9 months.", "NTA.  Sorry, no, it's exactly the same situation except that this time no little children are involved.  Let SIL take care of MIL; think of all the resources she saved by not letting you shower at her house.  \n\nCongratulations on making the absolute best of a truly horrible situation you faced during lockdown.", "OP, I was was thinking that when she came by, she was very apologetic. She would be so appreciative if you made a place for her in the home you built with your own hands because you had nowhere else to live.
