Shit turned sour in 2020 when I became jobless after having to homeschool our kids. Couldn't afford the rent. We got evicted 6 months later. My MIL, who offered us two bedrooms, backed out as soon as we became homeless and we ended up living out of our van for 4 months with our kids before a homeless shelter opened up. During said time MIL had very little contact with us. SIL was also tense from us asking to come to her house to shower, despite us offering payment. We were looked at like we were scum because we were over the age of 30, had 3 kids and didn't have our shit together. We were told how we were going about life all wrong and that if we had planned better we wouldn't be in the situation. Coming from SIL mostly, who was given her house after her father died and hadn't paid taxes in 4 years. \n\nFast forward, we were able to get back in our feet times ten. We built a house from scratch with our kids and gained a shit ton of experience for all of us. It came out perfect. The kids are ecstatic because they built their own house. We are happier than ever. We even started our own business. We did this together, without help from any of his family despite their promises and I will admit that I grew a nasty taste in my mouth about the whole lot of them, despite the end result turning out the way it did.\n\nWell, MIL is down and out currently. She was moved to PT employment due to her slow paced work style, her retirement was taken away apparently after the government stripped it from them and will likely be evicted soon, as she has already received two notices and a lease termination letter. She came here yesterday afternoon and asked us if she could stay here if she became evicted. I will admit that my first reaction was to outright laugh at her and her audacity. She looked immediately offended and uncomfortable, especially after I stated there wasn't a chance of that happening. My husband just stood beside me with his arms crossed, glaring at his mother- as he is very resentful of her allowing her grandchildren to live out of a van and homeless shelter after promises had already been made. Anyways, she left crying after saying the situation was entirely different. SIL however called us later and said that we were \"fucking trash\" for not allowing her soon to be evicted, elderly mother to move in. My only response was that a nursing home just opened up down the street and she can go there. However, a few friends say it was kind of mean.

Had to homeschool your kids\n\n2. Quit job to homeschool kids\n\n3. Got evicted for having no job\n\n\nNormally it would probably not be appropriate to ask why you needed to homeschool your kids, but it seems like an import piece of the chain here.\n\nQuitting your job to homeschool your kids when it means being unable to afford your rent means some bad financial planning leading your kids to being homeless. Unless there is some reason homeschooling them immediately was more important than them having a home I would say either YTA or everyone sucks.\n\nSkipped details around quitting your job when you could not afford to makes me wonder if there aren't also details missing about why MIL retracted her offer. Also trying to paint SIL as AHish for not being ecstatic that a family of five was sharing her shower is a little weird.\n\nEdit: One more question. SIL inherited a house, did your husband not inherit anything?", "Dude. DO you not remember what happened in 2020? Schools closed. All parents had to juggle our jobs AND providing full-time childcare, and many of us were let go because of it.", "Uh, you know, the thing with the coronavirus?

Everyone has to homeschool their children.", "First of all, good for you for managing to turn a bad situation around. It's not easy.  Secondly, you are definitely NTA.

She's an adult and has no dependents; who is now being forced to face the consequences of her own actions. Not just against you,  but more importantly against her innocent grandchildren who she punished to make a point. When there really shouldn't have been one to make. Not everything can be prepared for, looks like it's her turn to learn that lesson. Give her the address to a homeless shelter and a nursing home and call it a day. She doesn't deserve to be near your home or your children. If sil has an issue with it she can take her in.", "NTA. Why doesn\u2019t SIL take her?", "NTA. What goes around, comes around.

Your MIL turned her back on you and then when you were at your lowest, repeatedly kicked sand in your face (metaphorically of course).

While it may have been a bit mean to laugh at your MIL, it is totally understandable given how she treated you and your family.", "Yeah it does sound different.

Screw her. The situation is diffrent, she had no legit reason to not want to help you. You have valid reason not to help her.\n\nI cant even imagine this but I know its true. Makes me remember when I left my moms house with my husband and baby the day before Thanksgiving. I had the flu and had asked my mom if she cared if I just made my daughter soup and she cook dinner. (I did 99% of the cooking, paid rent, did all the laundry and used my foodstamps to pay for groceries so they didnt have to). She got mad and told me no i couldnt make nothing, kitchens closed. I said my baby needed to eat and she said \"not my problem\". So i walked downstairs, told my ex husband to help pack our shit and we were leaving.

She would be so appreciative if you made a place for her in the home you built with your own hands because you had nowhere else to live.
