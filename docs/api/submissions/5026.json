I tried to talk to the school headmaster but I ended up backing out due to my dear of talking about my home life.\n\nHowever, apparently one of my teachers noticed how underweight I am and spoke to my parents about it. She threatened to call child services if they didn't book a psychiatrist for my ED.\n\nMy dad indulged out of fear of losing me and now my session will be in a week. I'm really happy about it!\n\nThe people in my church always grimaces when they see my hair. I don't give a fuck to them, however, because I know I did the right thing!\n\nThank you everyone for the kind words. I believe the psychiatrist session will be the light at the end of the tunnel for me.", "created_utc": 1671371127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zoyz0t/update_aita_for_donating_my_hair_to_charity/", "score": 1127, "replies": ["That is fantastic news!

So here's one for you to practice.\n\nA psychiatrist is not (should not be) an authority figure.  They are somebody who is hired to provide a service.  All service jobs include people who passed the qualifications, but suck at it.  So: if your psychiatrist tries to tell you that you are the problem; if they get all bent out of shape about you making mercy and charity higher priorities than purity and obedience; if, in other words, they appear to have been chosen by your father because they agree with the nonsense taught by your silly, silly church?\n\nYou can fire the psychiatrist.

In the US at least, certain kinds of therapists are bound by law and professional ethics to keep your sessions confidential except in certain specific circumstances. Since you're a minor, you do fall into one of the exceptions (your parents have access to your diagnosis and treatment plan), but you still have some confidentiality rights: your therapist should give you details on what is and is not confidential from your parents if you ask.\n\nYou can tell if your therapist is a licensed professional bound by confidentiality by asking them, or by looking at their creditials. In my experience, they'll usually have credentials summarized on their business cards and their diplomas and licenses will be displayed in their offices.\n\nThe most common types I'm familiar with are:\n\n- **Psychiatrist**: a medical doctor (MD or DO) who has done a residency that qualifies them as a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. Some psychiatrists do talk therapy, but more often they do diagnosis and medication management and refer you to someone else for ongoing therapy sessions.\n\n- **Psychiatric PA or NP** (Physician's Assistant or Nurse Practitioner): similar to a psychiatrist, but with masters degree level schooling instead of a doctorate and a different type of residency training.\n\n- **Clinical Psychologist**: a psychologist (PhD in psychology) who is trained and qualified to perform therapy. Mainly does talk therapy.\n\n- **Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW)**: Does talk therapy like a clinical psychologist, but has a master's degree in social work instead of a PhD.\n\nIf you see any of these credentials, you should be covered by the limited confidentiality you're entitled to as a minor. If you don't, be on more alert for the possibility they're some kind of religious counsellor or similar who doesn't count as a therapist for confidentiality purposes.", "/u/Vegetable-Bad8521 please pay attention to these commenters (only be candid with the therapist if you can confirm they are not church-affiliated).", "Of course she has a choice.\n\nNot being around abusive people is a good choice that everyone should learn while young.", "This^ \n\nop make sure it isn't someone affiliated with your church in any way or you won't get any actual help from them. Instead they will report everything to your parents and use their position of authority and trust to try and manipulate you into doing what is expected of you. I'm really glad a teacher advocated for you, now please take care!", "\n\nI hope this really helps and you find comfort in talking to someone you trust.", "Counselors are also therapists (LMCH, LAP, LPC, LPCC, etc)! And in the US, parents have the right to access the entirety of their child\u2019s medical records, including session notes. Parents also have the right to ask about everything that happens in session and, while therapists can try to convince parents to let things stay in session (with exceptions for risk management), parents can ask and therapists legally cannot refuse to answer. This is a something that needs to be discussed with all involved parties, however.", "Best advice, ever!", "Her father is abusive and controlling.
