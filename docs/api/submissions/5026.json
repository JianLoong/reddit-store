She threatened to call child services if they didn't book a psychiatrist for my ED.\n\nMy dad indulged out of fear of losing me and now my session will be in a week. I'm really happy about it!\n\nThe people in my church always grimaces when they see my hair. I don't give a fuck to them, however, because I know I did the right thing!\n\nThank you everyone for the kind words.

So here's one for you to practice.\n\nA psychiatrist is not (should not be) an authority figure.  They are somebody who is hired to provide a service.  All service jobs include people who passed the qualifications, but suck at it.  So: if your psychiatrist tries to tell you that you are the problem; if they get all bent out of shape about you making mercy and charity higher priorities than purity and obedience; if, in other words, they appear to have been chosen by your father because they agree with the nonsense taught by your silly, silly church?\n\nYou can fire the psychiatrist.

In the US at least, certain kinds of therapists are bound by law and professional ethics to keep your sessions confidential except in certain specific circumstances. Since you're a minor, you do fall into one of the exceptions (your parents have access to your diagnosis and treatment plan), but you still have some confidentiality rights: your therapist should give you details on what is and is not confidential from your parents if you ask.\n\nYou can tell if your therapist is a licensed professional bound by confidentiality by asking them, or by looking at their creditials. In my experience, they'll usually have credentials summarized on their business cards and their diplomas and licenses will be displayed in their offices.\n\nThe most common types I'm familiar with are:\n\n- **Psychiatrist**: a medical doctor (MD or DO) who has done a residency that qualifies them as a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. Some psychiatrists do talk therapy, but more often they do diagnosis and medication management and refer you to someone else for ongoing therapy sessions.\n\n- **Psychiatric PA or NP** (Physician's Assistant or Nurse Practitioner): similar to a psychiatrist, but with masters degree level schooling instead of a doctorate and a different type of residency training.\n\n- **Clinical Psychologist**: a psychologist (PhD in psychology) who is trained and qualified to perform therapy. Mainly does talk therapy.\n\n- **Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW)**: Does talk therapy like a clinical psychologist, but has a master's degree in social work instead of a PhD.\n\nIf you see any of these credentials, you should be covered by the limited confidentiality you're entitled to as a minor. If you don't, be on more alert for the possibility they're some kind of religious counsellor or similar who doesn't count as a therapist for confidentiality purposes.", "/u/Vegetable-Bad8521 please pay attention to these commenters (only be candid with the therapist if you can confirm they are not church-affiliated).", "Of course she has a choice.\n\nNot being around abusive people is a good choice that everyone should learn while young.", "This^ \n\nop make sure it isn't someone affiliated with your church in any way or you won't get any actual help from them.

LPC Counselors are Masters-level professionals.", "It does show your privilege that you think that she can simply refuse to go to church. Sadly - that's not the case for a lot of kids. Sure, she might be too old/tall to physically force into a car, or she could simply refuse to get out if they did trick her into going somewhere else...but like, there are lots of ways abusers can make you do something without CPS getting involved. People 100% care that this child is being made to go to a church with lots of toxic people. But we also understand that sometimes it's the lesser of two evils. Like, going to church for another 2 years until you can escape, vs the hell your parents/abusers will rain down on you if you make it your mission to say, get banned from church. \n\nI lost privacy if I didn't comply to whatever my abusers wanted. Like, complete privacy. I wouldn't be able to pee in private. Told a teacher at school, and my parents came back with \"No, she's been talking about SH lately, so we have been keeping a closer eye on her, but the toilet story is rubbish. She's just being a drama queen\". Boom, teachers believed parents. \n\nThe parents could honestly withhold anything to make her comply into going to church. Food, showering, school, school work. It's quite easy. And if she reports them, it's easy for a parent to discredit their child and say \"No, she just wants us to buy junk - look at our house full of food!\"; \"No, we're not stopping her from showering! We've just asked that she doesn't shower at 5am and wake us all up and she refuses to shower at any other time\"... Sadly it's easy.", "No. People are suggesting that it's not as easy as saying \"no\" to her parents.\n\nStaying away would absolutely be the best thing for her, no argument there. The issue is if the parents would accept if she decided not to go, or if they would try to force her, either through throwing their weight as parents, or through outright abuse."]}
