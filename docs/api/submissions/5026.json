I tried to talk to the school headmaster but I ended up backing out due to my dear of talking about my home life.\n\nHowever, apparently one of my teachers noticed how underweight I am and spoke to my parents about it. She threatened to call child services if they didn't book a psychiatrist for my ED.\n\nMy dad indulged out of fear of losing me and now my session will be in a week. I'm really happy about it!\n\nThe people in my church always grimaces when they see my hair. I don't give a fuck to them, however, because I know I did the right thing!\n\nThank you everyone for the kind words. I believe the psychiatrist session will be the light at the end of the tunnel for me.", "created_utc": 1671371127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zoyz0t/update_aita_for_donating_my_hair_to_charity/", "score": 35, "replies": ["That is fantastic news!
