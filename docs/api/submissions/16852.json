If your sister is drinking more water (because she believes in the power of alkaline water), then she very well might be seeing a reduction in her acid reflux.\n\nIt doesn't matter why she's drinking more water.  It just matters that she is.  And if she can afford to install a filter in her home, and it will keep encouraging her to drink lots of water, then it's a good thing.", "YTA why are you so obsessed with what your sister is doing? Alkaline water does feel smooth and when you have acid reflux it\u2019s so refreshing on your throat. I can\u2019t explain it, it just feels nice.", "INFO: Will getting the filter put her in financial hardship or is she asking you for money to have it installed?", "YTA. The first part of this, what you say about alkaline water not affecting BLOOD ph is absolutely true. And has nothing to do with acid reflux. If you don't understand what happens when you mix a base with an acid, then you definitely have no business trying to police what people do for their own health.", "YTA. \n\nThe science in alkaline water is tricky, with many companies bending the truth just to make a sale. You're correct in saying that it doesn't really have many health benefits when the body is functioning normally as the body basically regulates its own pH, and interrupting its normal function isn't necessarily good for the body.\n\nThat said, there are also some studies that alkaline water could help with pH regulation for those with acid reflux. Also, your sister says that she did see some benefits after drinking it for a month. Which means, her decision wasn't made on a whim and is based on her informed opinion about her own body. \n\nNow, whether that is an actual effect of the alkaline water, or just a placebo effect remains to be seen. But, is it really worth damaging your relationship with her when her installing an alkaline filter doesn't really do her nor you any harm? Sure, maybe it's a waste of time in your point of view, but it clearly isn't to her. If she can afford it (which would be cheaper in the long run than buying bottled water), doesn't hurt anyone, and can potentially help her, why are you so against it?\n\nMaybe you need to re-examine your motivation for insisting your position. Is it really just to help her when she clearly isn't asking for help, or is it because you want to be right?", "Soft YTA - You said your piece, just let it go.

This isn\u2019t about the alkaline water. No matter what you do or don\u2019t believe, there are much better ways to confront her about something you think is dubious rather than \u201cthis is a scam and you are wasting your time\u201d. \n\nOf COURSE she dug her heels in and wouldn\u2019t listen. You approached this condescendingly and judgementally rather than coming from a place of genuine concern for your sister being scammed. Your attitude makes it seem like you just wanted to be right and feel smart, rather than actually help her out of being \u201cscammed\u201d. Why should she accept advice from someone who is being disrespectful to her? Would *you* ?", "In my medical opinion you are not getting enough daily CC\u2019s of snake oil my friend.

All you need to say is that is cool and leave it and leave it at that.", "YTA. As someone with a chronic issue, I can tell you sometimes we waste time and money throwing anything in the world at our issue because we just want a little hope that someone might help it. Will it? Probably not, but just let her have this small hope. It\u2019s her money and time. It\u2019s such a small thing to just let go and don\u2019t mention it.", "NTA.
