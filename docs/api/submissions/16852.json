If your sister is drinking more water (because she believes in the power of alkaline water), then she very well might be seeing a reduction in her acid reflux.\n\nIt doesn't matter why she's drinking more water.  It just matters that she is.  And if she can afford to install a filter in her home, and it will keep encouraging her to drink lots of water, then it's a good thing.", "YTA why are you so obsessed with what your sister is doing? Alkaline water does feel smooth and when you have acid reflux it\u2019s so refreshing on your throat. I can\u2019t explain it, it just feels nice.", "INFO: Will getting the filter put her in financial hardship or is she asking you for money to have it installed?", "YTA. The first part of this, what you say about alkaline water not affecting BLOOD ph is absolutely true. And has nothing to do with acid reflux. If you don't understand what happens when you mix a base with an acid, then you definitely have no business trying to police what people do for their own health.", "YTA. \n\nThe science in alkaline water is tricky, with many companies bending the truth just to make a sale. You're correct in saying that it doesn't really have many health benefits when the body is functioning normally as the body basically regulates its own pH, and interrupting its normal function isn't necessarily good for the body.\n\nThat said, there are also some studies that alkaline water could help with pH regulation for those with acid reflux. Also, your sister says that she did see some benefits after drinking it for a month. Which means, her decision wasn't made on a whim and is based on her informed opinion about her own body. \n\nNow, whether that is an actual effect of the alkaline water, or just a placebo effect remains to be seen. But, is it really worth damaging your relationship with her when her installing an alkaline filter doesn't really do her nor you any harm? Sure, maybe it's a waste of time in your point of view, but it clearly isn't to her. If she can afford it (which would be cheaper in the long run than buying bottled water), doesn't hurt anyone, and can potentially help her, why are you so against it?\n\nMaybe you need to re-examine your motivation for insisting your position.

You can have a statistically significant effect with a sample of 30, or even 20. With a smaller sample you need a larger effect for it to be considered \"statistically significant\", so finding statistical significance with a smaller sample implies there was a reasonably large effect. Conversely, it's super easy to find statistical significance with extremely large samples, though the actual size of the effect could be minuscule. That's why effect size is at least as important as statistical significance when interpreting results.\n\nThat's not to say that a larger sample isn't better, of course it is. Just that small samples can be statistically significant, and statistical significance kind of loses meaning with larger samples.\n\nWhat you're probably meaning to say is that the research lacks external validity, given issues with the size and selection of the sample.", "\"100 people anything less is useless\"   \nRare Disease Patients would like a fucking word.", "I mostly meant in the throat where acid isn't supposed to be, like maybe it helps wash it away, or neutralizes a little of what is stuck there?
