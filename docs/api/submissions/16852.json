If your sister is drinking more water (because she believes in the power of alkaline water), then she very well might be seeing a reduction in her acid reflux.\n\nIt doesn't matter why she's drinking more water.  It just matters that she is.  And if she can afford to install a filter in her home, and it will keep encouraging her to drink lots of water, then it's a good thing.", "YTA why are you so obsessed with what your sister is doing? Alkaline water does feel smooth and when you have acid reflux it\u2019s so refreshing on your throat. I can\u2019t explain it, it just feels nice.", "INFO: Will getting the filter put her in financial hardship or is she asking you for money to have it installed?", "YTA. The first part of this, what you say about alkaline water not affecting BLOOD ph is absolutely true. And has nothing to do with acid reflux. If you don't understand what happens when you mix a base with an acid, then you definitely have no business trying to police what people do for their own health.", "YTA. \n\nThe science in alkaline water is tricky, with many companies bending the truth just to make a sale. You're correct in saying that it doesn't really have many health benefits when the body is functioning normally as the body basically regulates its own pH, and interrupting its normal function isn't necessarily good for the body.\n\nThat said, there are also some studies that alkaline water could help with pH regulation for those with acid reflux. Also, your sister says that she did see some benefits after drinking it for a month. Which means, her decision wasn't made on a whim and is based on her informed opinion about her own body. \n\nNow, whether that is an actual effect of the alkaline water, or just a placebo effect remains to be seen. But, is it really worth damaging your relationship with her when her installing an alkaline filter doesn't really do her nor you any harm? Sure, maybe it's a waste of time in your point of view, but it clearly isn't to her. If she can afford it (which would be cheaper in the long run than buying bottled water), doesn't hurt anyone, and can potentially help her, why are you so against it?\n\nMaybe you need to re-examine your motivation for insisting your position.

That's why effect size is at least as important as statistical significance when interpreting results.\n\nThat's not to say that a larger sample isn't better, of course it is.

I hear that alkaline water can help with that.", "Briefly, statistical significance is a concept related to the probability that you'd see some sort of pattern of results based on random chance. Assuming the coin is fair, what's the probability of getting ten heads out of ten flips? (0.5 \\^ 10 = 0.0009765625, so pretty low--about 1 in a thousand).  Assuming that alkaline water has no effect on health outcomes, then what's the probability of seeing the benefits reported in the study just based on random fluctuations in the participants' day to day health? After all, it's not impossible that the group getting alkaline water might have a series of good days while the people in the control group don't feel so good during the study. Statistical analysis allows you to calculate the probability of that sort of random fluctuation, and then compare your own results to that expected degree of fluctuation, to see if your pattern can be attributed to random chance, or instead might reflect something deeper--such as an actual benefit (or harm) caused by alkaline water.\n\nOne convention in experimental research--not necessarily a good one, but a common one--is to say that any experiment whose results have a 5% probability or less of appearing by chance alone is 'statistically significant': 5% is so low a probability that the results probably aren't based on chance alone, and so reflect some underlying causal link.\n\nSo: when the probability of getting a certain set of results is .05 or less, we say the results are 'statistically significant'. \n\nNote how I didn't refer 'sample size' or 'number of participants' anywhere in that explanation. If we return to coin flips, recall that the probability of flipping heads 10 times in a row is about .001. That's lower than .05, so the results are 'statistically significant': the researcher would conclude that the coin is unlikely to be fair, because the probability of getting these results based on random chance is so low. We can make this conclusion with a sample size of 10. For that matter, we can also make this conclusion with a sample size of 5: The probability of flipping 5 heads out of 5 flips is .5 \\^ 5 = .03125, which is also less than .05, so it's also 'statistically significant'. What's more, if we have a HUGE sample size, like 2000, the probability of flipping 1025 heads or more out of 2000 flips is 0.127, which is greater than .05, so the results would be classified as 'not significant'.\n\ntl;dr: statistical significance refers to the probability that your results are so improbable that they are unlikely to have emerged by chance. This probability can be calculated for any sample size. Results from small samples can be significant. Results from large samples can be not significant. There's nothing special about a sample size of 100.", "is that anecdotal? also, while it is true that after i finished my stats courses my symptoms eased there is no way to know if there weren\u2019t other factors contributing. there was correlation but it didn\u2019t equal causation"]}
