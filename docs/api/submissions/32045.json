It's a big city and he lives far away. His grandparents and uncle don't know he's not living with us and pry a lot. He calls us every morning. He doesn't visit us very often and when he does, we fight. He thinks we don't respect his independence. He tells us that we weren't the best parents to him growing up. Both of us had jobs and never gave him much time. He spent most of his childhood with his grandparents instead of us. I want him to spend time with us now that we're older. AITA?\n\nI sent this to him at 7am in the morning. He has not replied.\n\n\"Hi, son. Your mother is not well. We had gone to a concert last weekend. She fell ill there and she couldn't breathe properly. She has started sneezing often and has trouble breathing properly. You should start taking care of her if you want her to recover faster. She puts on a brave front, trying to convince me everything is fine, but I know she is missing you. I am not trying to do any emotional blackmail but she is tired of answering probing questions from her parents and your uncle for which she has no answers. It is fine if you want to stay during the week there but at least during weekends, stay with us. It will make us happy and improve her health. I know whenever she talks to you, she ends up asking all the wrong questions but it is because she is too anxious. Your staying away in the same city and not calling us and even if you call, the call doesn\u2019t last more than a couple of minutes, is all hurting her deeply. I would have not sent this message if I were not concerned about her health. It is becoming more and more difficult for us to shift to the new home because the sofa guy isn\u2019t giving us a time when it will be delivered; the curtains have not be delivered too. The interior designer has gone back to her hometown leaving the work unfinished. There are things to be fixed in that house. At our old house, we can\u2019t leave the house empty for a long period. In case you believe that we are putting too much of pressure on you, asking you to stay with us during weekends, or even calling us without getting irritated, then please don\u2019t bother. I will somehow manage. As far as I am concerned, I know that it is payback time. I never took care of my parents during their old age. I kept them waiting, I used to get irritated often. Never took them out. I was a very bad son to them.\"", "created_utc": 1701338862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187f71g/aita_for_sending_this_to_my_son_22m_at_7am_in_the/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
