I don't have a problem with this though because as I said, he seems like a good person and that's what counts. \n\nHe was going to take my daughter out for ice cream earlier today, and while he was waiting for her to get ready he asked me if he could have some peanut butter. I said oh, don't you want to save room for the date, but he explained he didn't have enough money to buy something for himself (he's always paid on their dates as far as I know). \n\nThis poor kid was so hungry I could hear his stomach growling. offered to give him some money but he said he's not allowed to accept cash. I then asked him if it'd be alright if I took him out for dinner with my daughter, and he called his mom and she said it was ok. When May came downstairs I told her the new plan. She was upset and thought it was lame that I'd be with them. I said I could just sit in the car and she could call me when it was time to pick up the check, but she was having none of it and said she was going out with some friends instead.\n\nIt was a little embarrassing since she basically dumped him in front of me, but I kind of just moved on and asked F\u00e9lix if he still wanted to go. He said yeah so I took him down to Wendy's. We had a good time, but when I told May where I'd been she was furious. She accused me of liking her boyfriend romantically and that I shouldn't have gone \u201con a date\u201d with him without her.\n\nI reminded her I'd given her that option and she'd refused, but she said that didn't change anything and now she can't trust me with any of her boyfriends. I tried to tell her I'm not interested in her boyfriend at all but she just ran out of the room.\n\nI feel bad for her but I don't think I did anything wrong.

This kid will be going places when he grows up.", "NTA, but after she's had some time to calm down from her anger, sit down and have a chat with her about it. See what really set her off.\n\nAnd maybe point out that it is Super illegal for you to have a romantic interest in her boyfriend. But it is Not weird to take a parental interest in your daughter's boyfriend. And based on what you have shared with us, you have only taken an appropriate parental interest.", "NTA\u2026. But it seems like you may be raising an AH. You need to stop protecting her from the reality of life \u2026 I\u2019m sorry but she currently sound so friggin oblivious to the hardships of others and awful and I say this as a mother of a 14 year old daughter\u2026 who would never behave this way or even think these things.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nBut what you could do in future is give May the money to take Felix on a date. It\u2019s 2023 so women should also pay!", "The family of my first serious boyfriend ended up feeding me a lot. They would joke about whose turn it was to feed me. Life at home sucked and it was an everyone-fend-for-themselves for food thing. I was also not allowed to have a job or license before I turned 18. \n\nI didn\u2019t love the teasing about whose turn it was to feed me, but I really appreciate his family making it a regular family outing thing and always making sure I was fed. It would have never occurred for me to ask, so thank goodness they offered.", "I think that was very thoughtful of you to do. Your daughter is just being a dramatic kid, as they are. Don't worry, you're NTA.", "NTA. Pull your daughter aside, sit her down, and explain all the reasons you suspect he isn't well off and why you did what you did. You are a good person and shouldn't let this fester in her for long. Kids will think they know everything and eventually it will stick in her mind that what she said is true. If she still doesn't seem to care after understanding or starts to bully him at school for this you have a whole new problem about that kid.", "NTA! It was really kind to offer to pay for a dinner date and it really seems like your daughter had something else going on to be upset at. That or she's just being angsty because she was embarrassed.

I think it\u2019s telling that your daughter has been going out with this kid, letting him pay for her, while he gets nothing for himself because he is broke.

She still has some growing up to do!", "That was a very sweet story. NTA...\n\nBut, and at AITA, there is always a but...\n\nTalk to your daughter when her tantrum subsides about generosity and kindness, and maybe a little \"avoid false accusations.\" It may seem silly, but some people are believing the very worst on flimsier evidence.", "You did nothing wrong a child was hungry and you fed him.", "Oh no! Your daughter is becoming a brat! (And a bit of a nut-job, accusing you of being interested in a 14-year-old boy.)\n\nYou, NTA. But figure out why your daughter is being like this and try to turn her around.", "NTA\n\nYou did a nice thing for Felix, and if May is going to dump him and go out with her friends instead, then she's clearly not actually in to him at all. Her idea that you were hitting on her 14-year-old ex-boyfriend is obviously absurd.\n\nMay is ridiculous, but I suspect this is mostly because May is a 14-year-old girl.", "NTA . It sounds like your daughter is very selfish. You should sit her down alone and explain why you did what you did. She may well not understand her boyfriend is poor.\n\nWhat you did is very kind and a really normal thing for a parent to do. Not just for a childs boyfriend or friends who may be poorer but just in general. If you can afford it, it's perfectly fine to take your kids and their people out for all kinds of activities.\n\nIn fact your daughter should be bloody thrilled with you for this and expect it well into adulthood. \n\nIt's just what good parents do.", "NTA.  But your daughter is coming across like an entitled brat.  It might just be teenage hormones aka the world revolves around me - but maybe check on that.  You would have hoped she would have a little more self awareness.  That kid must have felt pretty awkward to be hanging out with his gf mom, so clearly he needed the food.", "I'm always horrified of these stories of apparent adults who are questioning their actions because a teenager had a widely inappropriate and shitty reaction to some innocuous event.\n\nLike, come on. You fed a hungry child. Of course you're not an asshole. It actually terrifies me that people who are supposed to be raising teenagers cannot tell when teenagers are being teenagers.", "NTA\n\nAs a former 14-year-old girl let me tell you, all she wanted to do was kiss that boy without you watching. She has no concept of the total situation the way that you do.   \n\n\nBut, that being said, you could have offered to go through the drive-thru with both of them before you dropped them off for their date. Wendy's isn't exactly the kind of place you have to sit down at in my experience, and you could probably have tried to make the meal more of a \"hey, by the way, I'm hungry - anyone else?\" thing instead of changing their entire date plan.  Not that it sounds like they're going to keep seeing each other... and I do hope that she'll sit down and hear you out after her initial anger subsides.", "NTA but your daughter sounds like a handful.", "Your daughter seems to need a reality check and a lesson in empathy.", "Sir your daughter is weird", "NTA your daughter is a brat, and an asshole", ">I feel bad for her but I don't think I did anything wrong.\n\nI do. You didn't punish your daughter for making a scene and shaming you for having empathy. NTA *enough*.\n\nI think you made a mistake in playing too much the role of the hero when the role of the patron (i.e., giving him food from your home) would have been sufficient for the day, and led to more time to think of a long term action. Whatever, it was worth a college try. Who plans to end up prepared for the situation you were in?", "NTA, you fed a hungry kid. Your daughter is 14 and the world is really emotional at that age. Her accusations are pretty out of line, but you'll need to have that conversation when she's in a better mood. Good luck. The teen years are rough!", "NTA because people need to learn tantrums shouldn\u2019t be used as a control mechanism.", "NTA. You went above and beyond to ensure that this kid had a meal. I think it's easy for your daughter to misunderstand. You should sit her down and explain what happened. Her BF might not want her to know the truth, but she could have the wrong impression for the rest of her life. Also, I would give her money for her dates, so that she pays half of the expenses.", "I don\u2019t think her attitude has anything to do with him being poor. I think the issue is they had a date planned and suddenly mom/dad was tagging along (which I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve never done?). She was getting ready and the plan changed without anyone asking her. \n\nIdk where her idea of you being interested in her minor boyfriend came from but that should be a conversation. \n\nYou should also talk to her about about him spending money on her because it\u2019s probably never the other way around. If she doesn\u2019t notice his money/family issues, you\u2019ve probably raised a very sheltered kid. Even if he was the very best at hiding his situation, there are always signs.", "NAH. Has your daughter ever noticed that F\u00e9lix doesn\u2019t get himself anything on their dates? maybe have a sit down with your daughter about F\u00e9lix\u2019s situation. They are both young so I don\u2019t want to be too harsh about na\u00efvet\u00e9, emotions, or some situational blindness. F\u00e9lix can\u2019t take cash gifts but could they pay for each other\u2019s meals?

Why didn't you just say, \"Sure, you can have some peanut butter.

Make it a teaching moment for your kid. Empathy is tough for teenagers. The best thing that you can do is to use real examples such as this to teach life lessons. The lessons here are:\n\n1 - Situational awareness/others' circumstances - ask her if she ever noticed that he never ate anything. If not, these are the types of things she should be paying attention to in order to learn not to be self absorbed. If she did notice, then:\n\n2 - critical thinking - did she ever ask herself why he wasn't eating? TBH kids are not learning how to connect the dots much these days.\n\n3 - informed decision-making - she accused you of some pretty harsh things without knowing all the facts. You need to drive this one home. What if she were to loudly say that at school about her mom dating a 14yo? A teacher overhears this (mandatory reporter) and your life could be turned upside-down in an instance. She needs to learn this lesson Hard.\n\n4 - a broader view about privilege and disparities in the real world - it sounds like you are well off or comfortable and your daughter probably has a pretty nice life. She needs to understand that this can lead to privileged ways of thinking in life that only serve to widen the socioeconomic gaps that are already ridiculous.\n\nI have a 14yo, and I feel like the next 4 years are about preparing for the real world by teaching as many life lessons as possible. When you can relate real world issues to a situation your teen is involved in, I feel like the lessons are much more impactful.", "That's a good question. She is young so it could be she doesn't know the signs to look for, and I doubt he would straight out tell her.

But at the end of the day, you fed a hungry child. How can you question that?", "I dont think your daughter has any clue what it's like to not have enough food to eat.

I doubt any of my efforts will make a slight effort but I hope OP feels supported.", "Are you mentally unwell? \n\nThe answer is yes but I needed to present that question to you so you could ponder it and let it sink in so you can realize and understand other people see it too lol. \n\nAnyways thanks for grammatical correction I\u2019m in the process of moving so it was an oversight \ud83e\udee1 this is the only response you will get from me", "Does she get allowance?", "OP seems like a nice person but her daughter is walking all over her. She needs to grow a spine and be a parent, not a best friend.", "Of course not.  Hearing your friends and random acquaintances sexualize your mom in front of/directly to you is super fucking geoss though.  Thanks ever so.", ">Are you mentally unwell? \n\nDude, I know you think you're being snarky and cute but you're the one who went on an unrelated tangent about Capitalism and heteronormativity or whatever lmao", "If she's old enough to date certainly she's old enough to earn an allowance", "Definitely. OP has partial blame in this situation. I wouldn\u2019t dare dream to treat my parents this way because I\u2019d get beaten. Not saying that\u2019s a good thing but Ops daughter has no idea how good she has it and how luck y she is to have a mom like that. OP, I really want to emphasize that yes teen eaters have hormones that are hard to control, but you need to learn how to discipline your daughter, before it\u2019s too late and she really learns what consequences are.", "This is clever", "My wife split everything 50/50 when we first dated, which impressed me a lot. She was the only girl I dated who did that. I married her and bought her a Ferrari for a wedding gift", "A 14 year old throwing a fit because she didn't want to go to dinner with her boyfriend and her parent is the most normal thing I can possibly imagine.", "Poor Felix, he clearly deserves someone who cares about hi.

I hope your son's girlfriend's brother can pull himself out of the Tate sphere and start looking up to better men.", "Good luck with that! Let us know how that ends up for you. If you keep acting like this, the only men who will want to date you are losers or abusers. It\u2019s your pick. The backlash against you is disguised concern. Do you really think you know better than the dozens of adults that have commented on here? That\u2019s your immaturity talking. It\u2019s ok, we\u2019ve all been there.\n\nWas your moms solution to Felix\u2019s hunger the best? no. Should she have come talked to you about her plans? Yes. You are young so it\u2019s reasonable that you don\u2019t understand the implications of your actions. What you saw was your mother essentially stealing the spotlight on your date and being a burden. What you failed to see was that Felix was so hungry he didn\u2019t even want to go on the date. HE WAS HUNGRY. \n\nInstead of questioning your moms reasonings, you blew up and made (untrue) assumptions and let your emotions get the best of you. And not just that you created a hateful campaign against your own mother. You can be better than that. You can treat people with kindness you know\u2026. It does get you a long way. \n\nSurround yourself with loving caring people and don\u2019t assume they have it out to get to you. Look at your mothers responses on this thread. She cares about you and realizes she went about it the wrong way. She\u2019s willing to have a conversation with you to set some boundaries on what you and her should expect when you have a boyfriend. \n\nShe\u2019s not an evil person out to destroy your relationship. She came onto this subreddit because she felt guilty and you are trying to tear your own mother apart. She\u2019s not perfect, she\u2019s just as flawed as any other human being. But she loves you and wants you to be happy. \n\nYou are not letting yourself be happy girl.", "It wasn't a tangent at all. They listed several topics that a 14yo wouldn't have considered in this scenario that would be good to draw their attention to. Being aware and considerate of your partner's finances as well as not expecting the boy to always pay are part of becoming a good romantic partner. Doing it at 14 means the stakes are low and people aren't seriously hurt.", "Well yeah but not all parents GIVE allowance.", ">all she wanted to do was kiss that boy without you watching.\n\nThis isn't how 14-year-old girls raised on social media think anymore.\n\nAll she wanted to do was eat a meal on his dime.", "> she doesn't see a problem as long as she gets hers.\n\nShe's a teen girl in 2023, it's 1000% this.", "But did the OP's daughter fully understand that her boyfriend was actually hungry?", "The daughter probably doesn't realize he is going hungry.", "Nah, dude. You're making lots of jumps in logic there that aren't supported by this post.

That's a lot of assumptions and imaginary scenarios you just made up.", "Your whole attitude on this. You're 14, sure, I had a hell of a teenage myself. I had my insufferable moments but my mom disciplined me. You need to have a chat with your mom about all this. \nHowever, yes breaking up over such stupid reason is also dumb. You can have all the reasons on earth but this was dumb", "You\u2019ve never met my mum!

Put your anger aside for a moment and talk with her. You can be angry at how it played out. but if you keep that anger inside you it will boil and fester. Do yourself a favor and think about why your Mom did why she did. \n\nTry to get your anger down to frustration at her decisions and be calm when you talk to her. It is helpful to write down your anger. You don\u2019t have to share it with her but it\u2019s a place to let the thoughts get out of your head. You will feel so much better. You still might feel angry but it\u2019s a place to start. Be annoyed, be frustrated. Anything but angry. \n\nAnger is a conduit and it\u2019s your body\u2019s way of letting you know a boundary has been breached. The way you deal with that anger decides how the people around you react. \n\nDo you want to be angry at your mom forever and get all your friends to turn against her, to never involve in your life again? Or do you want to eventually forgive her and work together to figure out what works for you and how to react in future scenarios. \n\nYour mom has wisdom she can share with you. She noticed that Felix was hungry and interpreted his needs in a way you did not see. Work together to understand how to address the situation together. She should have come to you first, tell her that. Then what are your options, could she have given you money for the date (which would make you an A+ gf in Felix\u2019s eyes), or dropped you off with money, fed you at home and then you could have left with Felix afterwards. \n\nThink about what was your goal with spending time with Felix. You wanted to go eat and have a conversation, spend some alone time. You have all the right to do that, and your Mom wants to help you do that. She\u2019s given you the space and freedom to make your own choices. She is someone you can go to for help but you both have to communicate on what that means for you. \n\nPlease don\u2019t block out your Mom.she has your best interest at heart. I haven\u2019t talked to my mom in 7 years and I know she wants to talk to me, but she allowed my birth dad to take $4K from my bank at 14 years of age and let me be abused by all the men in her life because she had no backbone. Your mom is a good mom, the people in this subreddit see that. Don\u2019t push her away, talk to her!", "I'm sorry, but making sure a hungry kid gets fed is not \"socializing\". OP tried to take all three of them out, but her daughter refused to join them \u2013 so, what, you think OP should have just let the poor boy go hungry?? You really should reexamine your priorities.", "@foreverweary7154 I would also talk to your son about the issue with expecting women to change how they look to prevent men from going after them. It\u2019s a good opportunity for that education.", "ESH. You need to communicate with your daughter. And ask her why she couldn't have paid for the date.", "I haven't seen their comments", "I am curious what age you think is appropriate?  \n\nAny older than like 16, and you just are abdicating the responsibility to teach your children healthy relationship dynamics.  Once they move out, that\u2019s much harder.\n\nOur society in general doesn\u2019t do a good job of teaching either girls or boys as kids how to have healthy relationships and the result is what you\u2019re seeing with more and more people not bothering to date or try to have relationships as adults.  Not just here but in many countries.", "Not everyone has cash on hand?", "Like you, I grew up poor. So poor that some days the only thing we had to eat was a bowl of rice. Together my husband and I created a wonderful life. Our kids want for nothing (17F and 13F). I made sure they realize that not everyone is like us. I've drilled into them that it's best not to brag about what you have. Some of their friends are poor and live in run down trailers. My heart broke for them when I saw and again when they came over for the first time and saw our house with huge eyes. \nI also made sure to expose my kids to giving to others. We've volunteered at the soup kitchen, buy underprivileged kids Christmas presents (I have my kids pick them out), etc. Right now my 13 year old is crocheting blankets for veterans in nursing homes and the VA hospital, her choice to do so.

WHat did you do to them?", "Don't have kids don't want kids. Honestly you're psycho viewpoint pissed me off.", "Why do you assume it is the parent's fault?  Every societal influence has made her this way.  It is really hard to fight against it and make girls/women not this way.", "No and that wasn\u2019t the point. Your reasons behind dumping him make you an asshole but I\u2019m so glad your extreme reaction set him free from your anger. You are over reacting and no one is on your side girl. Maybe think about why that is and stop thinking the world is out to get you. You are out for the world right now and looking for anything else to blame but yourself."]}
