He's a nice boy, really polite, but I can tell he most likely isn't from a well-to-do family. I don't have a problem with this though because as I said, he seems like a good person and that's what counts. \n\nHe was going to take my daughter out for ice cream earlier today, and while he was waiting for her to get ready he asked me if he could have some peanut butter. I said oh, don't you want to save room for the date, but he explained he didn't have enough money to buy something for himself (he's always paid on their dates as far as I know). \n\nThis poor kid was so hungry I could hear his stomach growling. offered to give him some money but he said he's not allowed to accept cash. I then asked him if it'd be alright if I took him out for dinner with my daughter, and he called his mom and she said it was ok. When May came downstairs I told her the new plan. She was upset and thought it was lame that I'd be with them. I said I could just sit in the car and she could call me when it was time to pick up the check, but she was having none of it and said she was going out with some friends instead.\n\nIt was a little embarrassing since she basically dumped him in front of me, but I kind of just moved on and asked F\u00e9lix if he still wanted to go. He said yeah so I took him down to Wendy's. We had a good time, but when I told May where I'd been she was furious. She accused me of liking her boyfriend romantically and that I shouldn't have gone \u201con a date\u201d with him without her.\n\nI reminded her I'd given her that option and she'd refused, but she said that didn't change anything and now she can't trust me with any of her boyfriends. I tried to tell her I'm not interested in her boyfriend at all but she just ran out of the room.\n\nI feel bad for her but I don't think I did anything wrong.

This kid will be going places when he grows up.", "NTA, but after she's had some time to calm down from her anger, sit down and have a chat with her about it. See what really set her off.\n\nAnd maybe point out that it is Super illegal for you to have a romantic interest in her boyfriend. But it is Not weird to take a parental interest in your daughter's boyfriend. And based on what you have shared with us, you have only taken an appropriate parental interest.", "NTA\u2026. But it seems like you may be raising an AH. You need to stop protecting her from the reality of life \u2026 I\u2019m sorry but she currently sound so friggin oblivious to the hardships of others and awful and I say this as a mother of a 14 year old daughter\u2026 who would never behave this way or even think these things.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nBut what you could do in future is give May the money to take Felix on a date. It\u2019s 2023 so women should also pay!", "The family of my first serious boyfriend ended up feeding me a lot. They would joke about whose turn it was to feed me. Life at home sucked and it was an everyone-fend-for-themselves for food thing. I was also not allowed to have a job or license before I turned 18. \n\nI didn\u2019t love the teasing about whose turn it was to feed me, but I really appreciate his family making it a regular family outing thing and always making sure I was fed. It would have never occurred for me to ask, so thank goodness they offered.", "I think that was very thoughtful of you to do. Your daughter is just being a dramatic kid, as they are. Don't worry, you're NTA.", "NTA. Pull your daughter aside, sit her down, and explain all the reasons you suspect he isn't well off and why you did what you did. You are a good person and shouldn't let this fester in her for long. Kids will think they know everything and eventually it will stick in her mind that what she said is true. If she still doesn't seem to care after understanding or starts to bully him at school for this you have a whole new problem about that kid.", "NTA! It was really kind to offer to pay for a dinner date and it really seems like your daughter had something else going on to be upset at. That or she's just being angsty because she was embarrassed. Don't feel too bad!", "NTA! is your daughter aware of Felix's situation? She could be thinking that he just wants to spoil her and not even realize he can't afford anything more.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s telling that your daughter has been going out with this kid, letting him pay for her, while he gets nothing for himself because he is broke. And she ditches him while he is standing in your home.  Let me be uncharacteristically polite by saying your daughter is \u201clacking\u201d in so many ways here. She still has some growing up to do!", "That was a very sweet story. NTA...\n\nBut, and at AITA, there is always a but...\n\nTalk to your daughter when her tantrum subsides about generosity and kindness, and maybe a little \"avoid false accusations.\" It may seem silly, but some people are believing the very worst on flimsier evidence.", "You did nothing wrong a child was hungry and you fed him.", "Oh no! Your daughter is becoming a brat! (And a bit of a nut-job, accusing you of being interested in a 14-year-old boy.)\n\nYou, NTA. But figure out why your daughter is being like this and try to turn her around.", "NTA\n\nYou did a nice thing for Felix, and if May is going to dump him and go out with her friends instead, then she's clearly not actually in to him at all. Her idea that you were hitting on her 14-year-old ex-boyfriend is obviously absurd.\n\nMay is ridiculous, but I suspect this is mostly because May is a 14-year-old girl.", "NTA . It sounds like your daughter is very selfish. You should sit her down alone and explain why you did what you did. She may well not understand her boyfriend is poor.\n\nWhat you did is very kind and a really normal thing for a parent to do. Not just for a childs boyfriend or friends who may be poorer but just in general. If you can afford it, it's perfectly fine to take your kids and their people out for all kinds of activities.\n\nIn fact your daughter should be bloody thrilled with you for this and expect it well into adulthood. \n\nIt's just what good parents do.", "NTA.  But your daughter is coming across like an entitled brat.  It might just be teenage hormones aka the world revolves around me - but maybe check on that.  You would have hoped she would have a little more self awareness.  That kid must have felt pretty awkward to be hanging out with his gf mom, so clearly he needed the food.", "I'm always horrified of these stories of apparent adults who are questioning their actions because a teenager had a widely inappropriate and shitty reaction to some innocuous event.\n\nLike, come on. You fed a hungry child. Of course you're not an asshole. It actually terrifies me that people who are supposed to be raising teenagers cannot tell when teenagers are being teenagers.", "NTA\n\nAs a former 14-year-old girl let me tell you, all she wanted to do was kiss that boy without you watching. She has no concept of the total situation the way that you do.   \n\n\nBut, that being said, you could have offered to go through the drive-thru with both of them before you dropped them off for their date. Wendy's isn't exactly the kind of place you have to sit down at in my experience, and you could probably have tried to make the meal more of a \"hey, by the way, I'm hungry - anyone else?\" thing instead of changing their entire date plan.  Not that it sounds like they're going to keep seeing each other... and I do hope that she'll sit down and hear you out after her initial anger subsides.", "NTA but your daughter sounds like a handful.", "Your daughter seems to need a reality check and a lesson in empathy.", "Sir your daughter is weird", "NTA your daughter is a brat, and an asshole", ">I feel bad for her but I don't think I did anything wrong.\n\nI do. You didn't punish your daughter for making a scene and shaming you for having empathy. NTA *enough*.\n\nI think you made a mistake in playing too much the role of the hero when the role of the patron (i.e., giving him food from your home) would have been sufficient for the day, and led to more time to think of a long term action. Whatever, it was worth a college try. Who plans to end up prepared for the situation you were in?", "NTA, you fed a hungry kid. Your daughter is 14 and the world is really emotional at that age. Her accusations are pretty out of line, but you'll need to have that conversation when she's in a better mood. Good luck. The teen years are rough!", "NTA because people need to learn tantrums shouldn\u2019t be used as a control mechanism.", "NTA. You went above and beyond to ensure that this kid had a meal. I think it's easy for your daughter to misunderstand. You should sit her down and explain what happened. Her BF might not want her to know the truth, but she could have the wrong impression for the rest of her life. Also, I would give her money for her dates, so that she pays half of the expenses.", "I don\u2019t think her attitude has anything to do with him being poor. I think the issue is they had a date planned and suddenly mom/dad was tagging along (which I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve never done?). She was getting ready and the plan changed without anyone asking her. \n\nIdk where her idea of you being interested in her minor boyfriend came from but that should be a conversation. \n\nYou should also talk to her about about him spending money on her because it\u2019s probably never the other way around. If she doesn\u2019t notice his money/family issues, you\u2019ve probably raised a very sheltered kid. Even if he was the very best at hiding his situation, there are always signs.", "NAH. Has your daughter ever noticed that F\u00e9lix doesn\u2019t get himself anything on their dates? maybe have a sit down with your daughter about F\u00e9lix\u2019s situation. They are both young so I don\u2019t want to be too harsh about na\u00efvet\u00e9, emotions, or some situational blindness. F\u00e9lix can\u2019t take cash gifts but could they pay for each other\u2019s meals? I think there are creative ways around this.", "You did a good thing she's needs a time out lol", "Yes, the date was off.\n\nno further interaction with daughter's boy needed", "YTA\n\nWhy was your first thought to take him out to dinner? Why didn't you just say, \"Sure, you can have some peanut butter.

Make it a teaching moment for your kid. Empathy is tough for teenagers. The best thing that you can do is to use real examples such as this to teach life lessons. The lessons here are:\n\n1 - Situational awareness/others' circumstances - ask her if she ever noticed that he never ate anything. If not, these are the types of things she should be paying attention to in order to learn not to be self absorbed. If she did notice, then:\n\n2 - critical thinking - did she ever ask herself why he wasn't eating? TBH kids are not learning how to connect the dots much these days.\n\n3 - informed decision-making - she accused you of some pretty harsh things without knowing all the facts. You need to drive this one home. What if she were to loudly say that at school about her mom dating a 14yo? A teacher overhears this (mandatory reporter) and your life could be turned upside-down in an instance. She needs to learn this lesson Hard.\n\n4 - a broader view about privilege and disparities in the real world - it sounds like you are well off or comfortable and your daughter probably has a pretty nice life. She needs to understand that this can lead to privileged ways of thinking in life that only serve to widen the socioeconomic gaps that are already ridiculous.\n\nI have a 14yo, and I feel like the next 4 years are about preparing for the real world by teaching as many life lessons as possible. When you can relate real world issues to a situation your teen is involved in, I feel like the lessons are much more impactful.", "That's a good question. She is young so it could be she doesn't know the signs to look for, and I doubt he would straight out tell her. On the other hand though, I do think 14 is old enough to recognize these things, so I may just ask her.", "Oh, I didn't think I was the asshole for feeding him.

I think you should talk to her. She was pretty unfair and although 14 is old enough, she is still a young teen.

But at the end of the day, you fed a hungry child. How can you question that?", "I dont think your daughter has any clue what it's like to not have enough food to eat.

Imagine if your mom decided to join your date out of the blue, and then took the boy out after you bailed. Your daughter definitely didn't act nicely, but I bet it comes mostly out of confusion.

OP should sit down with her (?) daughter and explain the situation to her, because I'm sure she didn't realize it. She only felt embarrassed that her mother wanted to accompany them on a date.", "Or what a hero OP is.\n\nOP, you\u2019re awesome. My kids bring kids like this around regularly because they know what we will do. We feed them. We let them stay for as long as their parents let them (sometimes days at a time). We send bags of snacks with them. We had one kid who had to hide their food because their parents wouldn\u2019t let them accept food from others, and this poor kid was starving (cps got involved). \n\nYou helped someone who clearly needed it. Your daughter needs a serious attitude adjustment - preferably before she gets the wrong idea and tells other kids about her boyfriend\u2019s difficult situation.", "Maybe daughter should eat peanut butter for a week.", "Oh absolutely. Paying for all the dates just makes the situation worst.\n\nAnd frankly, even if this kid was so rich he used dollar as toilet paper, daughter should still be paying for the occasional date.", "Even if the daughter is blissfully unaware, it's still a bad look that the boyfriend was paying for all the dates and it's still a parenting opportunity for the OP to give the daughter some perspective here.", "It just kinda happens tbh. 14 is in the year range where kids start spending a lot less time with their parents and conflicts tend to arise. Teenagers are cranky, don't like being told what to do or think, and believe themselves to be more mature than they actually are.\n\nShe spends more time at school than with her parents, and during this time at home, a certain amount is spent on social media or with friends. Even if OP parents well, her daughter is getting most of her current influences outside of the family circle.", "I would hope that the daughter would see that Felix was willing to sacrifice him not eating to take her out.  If not then the daughter is a huge asshole and needs help.", "I was going to suggest making her volunteer at a soup kitchen but you beat me to it.", "Wow wtf is wrong with you ops daughter. You canceled the freaking date. You bailed to go be with friends and you acted like a spoiled 2 year old throwing a tantrum. And if this isn't ops daughter then you need some serious help dude. Mom did right by Felix and daughter snapped for no reason and is accusing her mom of some messed up things that are so inaccurate it's not even funny.", "You need mental help", ">Felix won't have any more dates int he near future: NO GIRL will date the guy known for dropping his gf for a date with her mom.\n\nLol. I am sure he will be fine if that'll ever be the case. Felix is better off alone than dating girls from OP's daughter's friend group. After all, birds of a feather flock together", "She could have! But her being in the car while they eat isn\u2019t that wild given the kids are only 14. They can\u2019t drive themselves so she has to take them anyway I bet. They are still so young. \n\nHowever, I remember being 14 and I wanted my mom no where near me in a social setting. So I get the daughter not wanting that but OP is still in the right for feeding a hungry child.", "Because how else will they get to the restaurant? Unless they have good public transportation they still need a ride since they are only 14.", "Some people have \"hot moms\" and spend their entire lives hearing about it, it's not outside the realm of possibility.", "I\u2019m not sure age is relevant to the daughter\u2019s paranoia and delusions about her mom\u2019s relationship with a minor child\u2026", "Because her mom took her bf out on a date! It's an understandable conclusion to come to, or at least a normal thing for a teenager to assume/exaggerate. We know the mom was just concerned for the kid's welfare, but the teenager clearly doesn't see it that way. Hence, a small discussion is needed after she calms down.", "Can confirm!", "I taught 14 year olds and 100% agree", "My 13 yo can be occasionally bitchy but she is at least generally kind and can be easily moved to empathy with a simple comment.  This kid\u2026from the description she seems of meaner temperament.", "Excellent point, but it may have been that she didn't want to make a scene in front of bf. The was probably embarrassed enough by the situation as it was, if the daughter had also gotten grounded as a result of it, she definitely would have turned that on the kid too.", "Yeah that daughter's already several laps deep towards the red checkered flagged finish line. A lot of her behavior is concerning and should be nipped in the bud before it devolves into something worse.", "Yeah, it seems the obvious solution is for OP to give the daughter money to pay for the dates.", "Love this. Perfect.\n\n\ud83c\udfc6", "Ah yes, lets malnourish the daughter for the awful crime of ... Being a teenager who doesn't want their parent to come on their date and is embarrassed their parent took their ex out to dinner. That is definitely appropriate and will teach her a good lesson /s", "Oh so the brat weighs in. \n\nYou are petty and cruel and a bully, so get over yourself. You know perfectly well it wasn't a date with your mother. You're just being a spoiled drama queen. Your mother fed a hungry child as we all would have done. Too bad you're too self centered and lacking in empathy to see your mother did a good thing. \n\nYou're in the big kids sandbox now and no one is falling for your crap. Keep this shit up and in a few years no one will want to date you.", "It\u2019s not just kids. Some of the videos I\u2019ve seen-geared towards adults and dating, absolutely ridiculous!", "My son who\u2019s 21 almost went down the Ben Shapiro rabbit hole at 13 or 14. He told his brother\u2019s girlfriend whose little brother likes Andrew Tate to start seeding his YouTube and other social media with Hasan Piker, the Good Liars, Daily Show, etc to counterbalance the garbage out there. It\u2019s still edgy but on the right side of life. Don\u2019t think your son is too young\u2014he\u2019s already hearing garbage. Deep breath.", "Never doubt the influence of socialization through friends either. My girlfriends son is 14, he\u2019s gotten everything he could have ever wanted his entire life. We\u2019re not well off by any means, but the kids don\u2019t know that. His friends are emo kids from struggling families, and have a lot of angst and acting out because their home life sucks. His best friend lives in a one bedroom apartment with her mom, grandparent, and brother..rightfully has a lot to be angsty about. \n\nOur son in response also decided to become angsty, literally blinded by his friend group. They\u2019re all getting jobs at 14 to support their families, and he thought that meant he was too and was upset he couldn\u2019t continue to play video games all summer. We had to remind him he isn\u2019t getting one (unless he wants one and his grades improve). \n\nKids are stupid.", "Yeah I\u2019ve stumbled on a lot of social media posts where women encourage other women to expect men to do literally everything for them. I try not to judge\u2026. But men who pay for everything everything tend to also be controlling.", "I disagree OP offered to pay,offered to leave them alone whilst she waited outside regardless of how long it took I might add and the daughter is acting like OP just offered to commit paedophilic activities. I mean what kind of bloody kid accuses their parent of trying to steal their boyfriend? Daughter needs to grow up and realise that these are the kind of accusations that could literally ruin people's lives cost them jobs friends and families if the wrong people hear about it.", "**The girl did NOT cancel the date. MOM canceled her date**, the girl just refused to do the replacement acticity her mom had decided to have them do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"You bailed to go be with friends \" .. A reasonable action, after a breakup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Mom did right by Felix\" .. **she ended his relationship, and took any chance of him having a date in the near future away:  THIS story will spread, and nobody will want to date the guy who let his date's mom cancel his date because MOM prefered other activities.** But he had a nice dinner with her.", "okay genius, and then what? OP adopts the boy? What the actual FUCK would talking to his parents do?", "Mom could have also just let them eat some peanut butter in the kitchen like he asked, not invited herself on their date.", "She can pick them up later. Or let them find their own way like they were planning with the ice cream", "The point is she\u2019s intruding", "I got arrested and was drinking in pubs by 14. Mum tried to stop me but I was a menace. 14/15 year old girls especially are complete assholes in a lot of cases. They grow out of it mostly though, thankfully!", "Yeah, I have a 16YO and 18YO. I don't get the \"all teens are assholes\" narrative. They're not always the most rational because they're trying to make sense of the world, but they're not all (or mostly) mean. My daughter went through a few months where I couldn't say good morning without it pissing her off, but otherwise, they're lovely humans. I didn't act like a shit to my mom when I was a teen. I think it's just people excusing the behavior by claiming it's \"normal.\"", "I\u2019ll take your poor man\u2019s gold graciously. Thank you.", "The Daily Show is edgy? I must be cooler than I thought - been watching for almost a quarter century.", "> Daughter needs to grow up\n\nYes, she literally does because she's a dumb 14 year old. They don't understand this stuff because they're the ones who get groomed and see nothing wrong with it unless adults intervene for their safety.", ">The daughter was delighted, too - until her mom ruined it.\n\nRuined what exactly? The date? No, she dumped him right infront of her, so she did that herself. His hungriness? Well , I think the mother is not TA for not wanting a 14 year old kid to be hungry.\n\nAnd yes, fixing him a sandwich would have fed the kid but he was expecting to go on a date so even if it wasn't on a date and especially since he has treated her daughter a lot of times apparently, I think it's sensible that OP treated him to eat outside her house.\n\nI don't even see it as much of an issue at all, but teenagers gotta teenage, I guess.", "Are you even old enough to use reddit lol ?", "In this situation, Mom doesn\u2019t like the boy the way you are implying. Mom fed the boy a decent fast food dinner because he\u2019s going hungry at home and on dates only spending his money on you.", "You seem to have some anger issues, might want to look into that. On a separate note are you aware people can eat together without it being a date? Shocking, I know!", "Damn you need some serious help, mom did not cancel shit she even tried to compromise and sit in the car while the two kids had their date but daughter lost her shit canceled the whole thing and bailed. i think daughter might've used this as an easy out to dump felix which is pretty pathetic. Op was being a good mom and person by feeding a hungry kid, her plan of taking them to dinner and sit in the car and pay when they were done is an awesome compromise but daughter lost her shit for some reason. You are wrong dude just stop saying such weird fucking shit", "I don\u2019t think the majority of teens are assholes on purpose. Like you said, they\u2019re still trying to figure out how life works. a\nAnd sometimes they choose poorly or don\u2019t completely think things through, and the result makes them *look* like an asshole. \n\nOf course, some of them make the deliberate choice to be assholes. And that doesn\u2019t mean you totally excuse the other behaviors. Parenting teenagers is a special skill set that unfortunately does not have an instruction manual.", "All kids need to be protected from such disgusting and sick people.

She doesn't sound like a good person to react like that and have no empathy for her boyfriend that is basically  starving. The daughter needs to get her head outta her ass but she is only 14 and has a lot to learn.\n\nEdit: op is NTA and her daughter has some serious issues if she really thinks what her mom did was a \"date\" instead of mom being a fucking person and feeding a hungry child.", "Except she was given that option, because her mom said could wait outside until they were ready to pay.", "You're aware that you're not talking to OP's daughter, right?", "It is STILL ok to end a relationship, REGARDLESS of the reason.", "**They had a date to go for icecream - her MOM canceled that.**  And MOM decided they should have another date that was more to HER taste.
