I don't have a problem with this though because as I said, he seems like a good person and that's what counts. \n\nHe was going to take my daughter out for ice cream earlier today, and while he was waiting for her to get ready he asked me if he could have some peanut butter. I said oh, don't you want to save room for the date, but he explained he didn't have enough money to buy something for himself (he's always paid on their dates as far as I know). \n\nThis poor kid was so hungry I could hear his stomach growling. offered to give him some money but he said he's not allowed to accept cash. I then asked him if it'd be alright if I took him out for dinner with my daughter, and he called his mom and she said it was ok. When May came downstairs I told her the new plan. She was upset and thought it was lame that I'd be with them. I said I could just sit in the car and she could call me when it was time to pick up the check, but she was having none of it and said she was going out with some friends instead.\n\nIt was a little embarrassing since she basically dumped him in front of me, but I kind of just moved on and asked F\u00e9lix if he still wanted to go. He said yeah so I took him down to Wendy's. We had a good time, but when I told May where I'd been she was furious. She accused me of liking her boyfriend romantically and that I shouldn't have gone \u201con a date\u201d with him without her.\n\nI reminded her I'd given her that option and she'd refused, but she said that didn't change anything and now she can't trust me with any of her boyfriends. I tried to tell her I'm not interested in her boyfriend at all but she just ran out of the room.\n\nI feel bad for her but I don't think I did anything wrong.

This kid will be going places when he grows up.", "NTA, but after she's had some time to calm down from her anger, sit down and have a chat with her about it. See what really set her off.\n\nAnd maybe point out that it is Super illegal for you to have a romantic interest in her boyfriend. But it is Not weird to take a parental interest in your daughter's boyfriend. And based on what you have shared with us, you have only taken an appropriate parental interest.", "NTA\u2026. But it seems like you may be raising an AH. You need to stop protecting her from the reality of life \u2026 I\u2019m sorry but she currently sound so friggin oblivious to the hardships of others and awful and I say this as a mother of a 14 year old daughter\u2026 who would never behave this way or even think these things.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nBut what you could do in future is give May the money to take Felix on a date. It\u2019s 2023 so women should also pay!", "The family of my first serious boyfriend ended up feeding me a lot. They would joke about whose turn it was to feed me. Life at home sucked and it was an everyone-fend-for-themselves for food thing. I was also not allowed to have a job or license before I turned 18. \n\nI didn\u2019t love the teasing about whose turn it was to feed me, but I really appreciate his family making it a regular family outing thing and always making sure I was fed. It would have never occurred for me to ask, so thank goodness they offered.", "I think that was very thoughtful of you to do. Your daughter is just being a dramatic kid, as they are. Don't worry, you're NTA.", "NTA. Pull your daughter aside, sit her down, and explain all the reasons you suspect he isn't well off and why you did what you did. You are a good person and shouldn't let this fester in her for long. Kids will think they know everything and eventually it will stick in her mind that what she said is true. If she still doesn't seem to care after understanding or starts to bully him at school for this you have a whole new problem about that kid.", "NTA! It was really kind to offer to pay for a dinner date and it really seems like your daughter had something else going on to be upset at. That or she's just being angsty because she was embarrassed. Don't feel too bad!", "NTA! is your daughter aware of Felix's situation? She could be thinking that he just wants to spoil her and not even realize he can't afford anything more.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s telling that your daughter has been going out with this kid, letting him pay for her, while he gets nothing for himself because he is broke. And she ditches him while he is standing in your home.  Let me be uncharacteristically polite by saying your daughter is \u201clacking\u201d in so many ways here. She still has some growing up to do!", "That was a very sweet story. NTA...\n\nBut, and at AITA, there is always a but...\n\nTalk to your daughter when her tantrum subsides about generosity and kindness, and maybe a little \"avoid false accusations.\" It may seem silly, but some people are believing the very worst on flimsier evidence.", "You did nothing wrong a child was hungry and you fed him.", "Oh no! Your daughter is becoming a brat! (And a bit of a nut-job, accusing you of being interested in a 14-year-old boy.)\n\nYou, NTA. But figure out why your daughter is being like this and try to turn her around.", "NTA\n\nYou did a nice thing for Felix, and if May is going to dump him and go out with her friends instead, then she's clearly not actually in to him at all. Her idea that you were hitting on her 14-year-old ex-boyfriend is obviously absurd.\n\nMay is ridiculous, but I suspect this is mostly because May is a 14-year-old girl.", "NTA . It sounds like your daughter is very selfish. You should sit her down alone and explain why you did what you did. She may well not understand her boyfriend is poor.\n\nWhat you did is very kind and a really normal thing for a parent to do. Not just for a childs boyfriend or friends who may be poorer but just in general. If you can afford it, it's perfectly fine to take your kids and their people out for all kinds of activities.\n\nIn fact your daughter should be bloody thrilled with you for this and expect it well into adulthood. \n\nIt's just what good parents do.", "NTA.  But your daughter is coming across like an entitled brat.  It might just be teenage hormones aka the world revolves around me - but maybe check on that.  You would have hoped she would have a little more self awareness.  That kid must have felt pretty awkward to be hanging out with his gf mom, so clearly he needed the food.", "I'm always horrified of these stories of apparent adults who are questioning their actions because a teenager had a widely inappropriate and shitty reaction to some innocuous event.\n\nLike, come on. You fed a hungry child. Of course you're not an asshole. It actually terrifies me that people who are supposed to be raising teenagers cannot tell when teenagers are being teenagers.", "NTA\n\nAs a former 14-year-old girl let me tell you, all she wanted to do was kiss that boy without you watching. She has no concept of the total situation the way that you do.   \n\n\nBut, that being said, you could have offered to go through the drive-thru with both of them before you dropped them off for their date. Wendy's isn't exactly the kind of place you have to sit down at in my experience, and you could probably have tried to make the meal more of a \"hey, by the way, I'm hungry - anyone else?\" thing instead of changing their entire date plan.  Not that it sounds like they're going to keep seeing each other... and I do hope that she'll sit down and hear you out after her initial anger subsides.", "NTA but your daughter sounds like a handful.", "Your daughter seems to need a reality check and a lesson in empathy.", "Sir your daughter is weird", "NTA your daughter is a brat, and an asshole", ">I feel bad for her but I don't think I did anything wrong.\n\nI do. You didn't punish your daughter for making a scene and shaming you for having empathy. NTA *enough*.\n\nI think you made a mistake in playing too much the role of the hero when the role of the patron (i.e., giving him food from your home) would have been sufficient for the day, and led to more time to think of a long term action. Whatever, it was worth a college try. Who plans to end up prepared for the situation you were in?", "NTA, you fed a hungry kid. Your daughter is 14 and the world is really emotional at that age. Her accusations are pretty out of line, but you'll need to have that conversation when she's in a better mood. Good luck. The teen years are rough!", "NTA because people need to learn tantrums shouldn\u2019t be used as a control mechanism.", "NTA. You went above and beyond to ensure that this kid had a meal. I think it's easy for your daughter to misunderstand. You should sit her down and explain what happened. Her BF might not want her to know the truth, but she could have the wrong impression for the rest of her life. Also, I would give her money for her dates, so that she pays half of the expenses.", "I don\u2019t think her attitude has anything to do with him being poor. I think the issue is they had a date planned and suddenly mom/dad was tagging along (which I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve never done?). She was getting ready and the plan changed without anyone asking her. \n\nIdk where her idea of you being interested in her minor boyfriend came from but that should be a conversation. \n\nYou should also talk to her about about him spending money on her because it\u2019s probably never the other way around. If she doesn\u2019t notice his money/family issues, you\u2019ve probably raised a very sheltered kid. Even if he was the very best at hiding his situation, there are always signs.", "NAH. Has your daughter ever noticed that F\u00e9lix doesn\u2019t get himself anything on their dates? maybe have a sit down with your daughter about F\u00e9lix\u2019s situation. They are both young so I don\u2019t want to be too harsh about na\u00efvet\u00e9, emotions, or some situational blindness. F\u00e9lix can\u2019t take cash gifts but could they pay for each other\u2019s meals?

Why didn't you just say, \"Sure, you can have some peanut butter.

Make it a teaching moment for your kid. Empathy is tough for teenagers. The best thing that you can do is to use real examples such as this to teach life lessons. The lessons here are:\n\n1 - Situational awareness/others' circumstances - ask her if she ever noticed that he never ate anything. If not, these are the types of things she should be paying attention to in order to learn not to be self absorbed. If she did notice, then:\n\n2 - critical thinking - did she ever ask herself why he wasn't eating? TBH kids are not learning how to connect the dots much these days.\n\n3 - informed decision-making - she accused you of some pretty harsh things without knowing all the facts. You need to drive this one home. What if she were to loudly say that at school about her mom dating a 14yo? A teacher overhears this (mandatory reporter) and your life could be turned upside-down in an instance. She needs to learn this lesson Hard.\n\n4 - a broader view about privilege and disparities in the real world - it sounds like you are well off or comfortable and your daughter probably has a pretty nice life. She needs to understand that this can lead to privileged ways of thinking in life that only serve to widen the socioeconomic gaps that are already ridiculous.\n\nI have a 14yo, and I feel like the next 4 years are about preparing for the real world by teaching as many life lessons as possible. When you can relate real world issues to a situation your teen is involved in, I feel like the lessons are much more impactful.", "That's a good question. She is young so it could be she doesn't know the signs to look for, and I doubt he would straight out tell her. On the other hand though, I do think 14 is old enough to recognize these things, so I may just ask her.", "Oh, I didn't think I was the asshole for feeding him.

I think you should talk to her. She was pretty unfair and although 14 is old enough, she is still a young teen.

But at the end of the day, you fed a hungry child. How can you question that?", "I dont think your daughter has any clue what it's like to not have enough food to eat.

Mom did not allow us to have our date without her intruding, and Felix took HER side.\n\nThe relationship is over, and mom trook the opportunity to do the date herself instead of me.\n\nAt least she has friends she can go to for emotional support - at home, SHe is less important than everybody else, because you like your virtue signalling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will have two consequences:\n\n* Your daughter will NEVER trust you again, and will avoid telling you anything.\n* Felix won't have any more dates int he near future: NO GIRL will date the guy known for dropping his gf for a date with her mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Are you happy that you ruined your daughter's relationship?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy didn't you just fix him a sandwich?", "Make sure she learns early before she becomes the sort of person people don't want to date.", "[Comment-stealing bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dcqmm/aita_for_taking_my_daughters_boyfriend_out_to/ju1e1mu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)", "Probably a dumb teenager.
