He's a nice boy, really polite, but I can tell he most likely isn't from a well-to-do family. I don't have a problem with this though because as I said, he seems like a good person and that's what counts. \n\nHe was going to take my daughter out for ice cream earlier today, and while he was waiting for her to get ready he asked me if he could have some peanut butter. I said oh, don't you want to save room for the date, but he explained he didn't have enough money to buy something for himself (he's always paid on their dates as far as I know). \n\nThis poor kid was so hungry I could hear his stomach growling. offered to give him some money but he said he's not allowed to accept cash. I then asked him if it'd be alright if I took him out for dinner with my daughter, and he called his mom and she said it was ok. When May came downstairs I told her the new plan. She was upset and thought it was lame that I'd be with them. I said I could just sit in the car and she could call me when it was time to pick up the check, but she was having none of it and said she was going out with some friends instead.\n\nIt was a little embarrassing since she basically dumped him in front of me, but I kind of just moved on and asked F\u00e9lix if he still wanted to go. He said yeah so I took him down to Wendy's. We had a good time, but when I told May where I'd been she was furious. She accused me of liking her boyfriend romantically and that I shouldn't have gone \u201con a date\u201d with him without her.\n\nI reminded her I'd given her that option and she'd refused, but she said that didn't change anything and now she can't trust me with any of her boyfriends. I tried to tell her I'm not interested in her boyfriend at all but she just ran out of the room.\n\nI feel bad for her but I don't think I did anything wrong.

That is worth having a chat to her about.\n\nNTA for taking him out.  The kid was going to go hungry in order to buy her an icecream.  This kid will be going places when he grows up.", "NTA, but after she's had some time to calm down from her anger, sit down and have a chat with her about it. See what really set her off.\n\nAnd maybe point out that it is Super illegal for you to have a romantic interest in her boyfriend. But it is Not weird to take a parental interest in your daughter's boyfriend. And based on what you have shared with us, you have only taken an appropriate parental interest.", "NTA\u2026. But it seems like you may be raising an AH. You need to stop protecting her from the reality of life \u2026 I\u2019m sorry but she currently sound so friggin oblivious to the hardships of others and awful and I say this as a mother of a 14 year old daughter\u2026 who would never behave this way or even think these things.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nBut what you could do in future is give May the money to take Felix on a date. It\u2019s 2023 so women should also pay!", "The family of my first serious boyfriend ended up feeding me a lot. They would joke about whose turn it was to feed me. Life at home sucked and it was an everyone-fend-for-themselves for food thing. I was also not allowed to have a job or license before I turned 18. \n\nI didn\u2019t love the teasing about whose turn it was to feed me, but I really appreciate his family making it a regular family outing thing and always making sure I was fed. It would have never occurred for me to ask, so thank goodness they offered.", "I think that was very thoughtful of you to do. Your daughter is just being a dramatic kid, as they are. Don't worry, you're NTA.", "NTA. Pull your daughter aside, sit her down, and explain all the reasons you suspect he isn't well off and why you did what you did. You are a good person and shouldn't let this fester in her for long. Kids will think they know everything and eventually it will stick in her mind that what she said is true. If she still doesn't seem to care after understanding or starts to bully him at school for this you have a whole new problem about that kid.", "NTA! It was really kind to offer to pay for a dinner date and it really seems like your daughter had something else going on to be upset at. That or she's just being angsty because she was embarrassed. Don't feel too bad!", "NTA! is your daughter aware of Felix's situation? She could be thinking that he just wants to spoil her and not even realize he can't afford anything more.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s telling that your daughter has been going out with this kid, letting him pay for her, while he gets nothing for himself because he is broke. And she ditches him while he is standing in your home.  Let me be uncharacteristically polite by saying your daughter is \u201clacking\u201d in so many ways here. She still has some growing up to do!", "That was a very sweet story. NTA...\n\nBut, and at AITA, there is always a but...\n\nTalk to your daughter when her tantrum subsides about generosity and kindness, and maybe a little \"avoid false accusations.\" It may seem silly, but some people are believing the very worst on flimsier evidence.", "You did nothing wrong a child was hungry and you fed him.", "Oh no! Your daughter is becoming a brat! (And a bit of a nut-job, accusing you of being interested in a 14-year-old boy.)\n\nYou, NTA. But figure out why your daughter is being like this and try to turn her around.", "NTA\n\nYou did a nice thing for Felix, and if May is going to dump him and go out with her friends instead, then she's clearly not actually in to him at all. Her idea that you were hitting on her 14-year-old ex-boyfriend is obviously absurd.\n\nMay is ridiculous, but I suspect this is mostly because May is a 14-year-old girl.", "NTA . It sounds like your daughter is very selfish. You should sit her down alone and explain why you did what you did. She may well not understand her boyfriend is poor.\n\nWhat you did is very kind and a really normal thing for a parent to do. Not just for a childs boyfriend or friends who may be poorer but just in general. If you can afford it, it's perfectly fine to take your kids and their people out for all kinds of activities.\n\nIn fact your daughter should be bloody thrilled with you for this and expect it well into adulthood. \n\nIt's just what good parents do.", "NTA.  But your daughter is coming across like an entitled brat.  It might just be teenage hormones aka the world revolves around me - but maybe check on that.  You would have hoped she would have a little more self awareness.  That kid must have felt pretty awkward to be hanging out with his gf mom, so clearly he needed the food.", "I'm always horrified of these stories of apparent adults who are questioning their actions because a teenager had a widely inappropriate and shitty reaction to some innocuous event.\n\nLike, come on. You fed a hungry child. Of course you're not an asshole. It actually terrifies me that people who are supposed to be raising teenagers cannot tell when teenagers are being teenagers.", "NTA\n\nAs a former 14-year-old girl let me tell you, all she wanted to do was kiss that boy without you watching. She has no concept of the total situation the way that you do.   \n\n\nBut, that being said, you could have offered to go through the drive-thru with both of them before you dropped them off for their date. Wendy's isn't exactly the kind of place you have to sit down at in my experience, and you could probably have tried to make the meal more of a \"hey, by the way, I'm hungry - anyone else?\" thing instead of changing their entire date plan.  Not that it sounds like they're going to keep seeing each other... and I do hope that she'll sit down and hear you out after her initial anger subsides.", "NTA but your daughter sounds like a handful.", "Your daughter seems to need a reality check and a lesson in empathy.", "Sir your daughter is weird", "NTA your daughter is a brat, and an asshole", ">I feel bad for her but I don't think I did anything wrong.\n\nI do. You didn't punish your daughter for making a scene and shaming you for having empathy. NTA *enough*.\n\nI think you made a mistake in playing too much the role of the hero when the role of the patron (i.e., giving him food from your home) would have been sufficient for the day, and led to more time to think of a long term action. Whatever, it was worth a college try. Who plans to end up prepared for the situation you were in?", "NTA, you fed a hungry kid. Your daughter is 14 and the world is really emotional at that age. Her accusations are pretty out of line, but you'll need to have that conversation when she's in a better mood. Good luck. The teen years are rough!", "NTA because people need to learn tantrums shouldn\u2019t be used as a control mechanism.", "NTA. You went above and beyond to ensure that this kid had a meal. I think it's easy for your daughter to misunderstand. You should sit her down and explain what happened. Her BF might not want her to know the truth, but she could have the wrong impression for the rest of her life. Also, I would give her money for her dates, so that she pays half of the expenses.", "I don\u2019t think her attitude has anything to do with him being poor. I think the issue is they had a date planned and suddenly mom/dad was tagging along (which I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve never done?). She was getting ready and the plan changed without anyone asking her. \n\nIdk where her idea of you being interested in her minor boyfriend came from but that should be a conversation. \n\nYou should also talk to her about about him spending money on her because it\u2019s probably never the other way around. If she doesn\u2019t notice his money/family issues, you\u2019ve probably raised a very sheltered kid. Even if he was the very best at hiding his situation, there are always signs.", "NAH. Has your daughter ever noticed that F\u00e9lix doesn\u2019t get himself anything on their dates? maybe have a sit down with your daughter about F\u00e9lix\u2019s situation. They are both young so I don\u2019t want to be too harsh about na\u00efvet\u00e9, emotions, or some situational blindness. F\u00e9lix can\u2019t take cash gifts but could they pay for each other\u2019s meals? I think there are creative ways around this.", "You did a good thing she's needs a time out lol", "Yes, the date was off.\n\nno further interaction with daughter's boy needed", "YTA\n\nWhy was your first thought to take him out to dinner? Why didn't you just say, \"Sure, you can have some peanut butter. Want some bread and jelly to go with it?\" You decided you should take them both out to dinner, something you could not have possibly thought was going to go over well with your daughter, given her reaction.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Idk why he isn't ALLOWED to take cash. If it was a choice thing on his part about pride, then whatever. But it sounds like a rule he's been forced to follow. It's going to do nothing but harm him in the future if he can't realize that accepting help isn't weak, having your pride lead to downfall is.", "NTA  This is great that you fed a hungry child \ud83e\udd70", "NTA but her train of thought is very concerning and her speaking like that is not okay. I would seriously talk to her and ask her if she was truly okay with her bf eating some of her food or no food at all.", "NTA\n\nExplain the situation to your daughter. Straight up tell her \u2014 \u201cI can see this kid was fucking starving so I bought him some food and spent time talking to him because he seemed sad. I fully support the choices you make, whether you date him or not, but if I see someone who needs a little help, I\u2019m going to help them whether they\u2019re a kid your age or a goddamn green alien from Mars.\u201d\n\nIt might be a good opportunity to model empathy for your daughter. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nShe\u2019ll respect you more for telling the truth and being honest about it.", "You parented.

I wouldn\u2019t have explained her boyfriends personal business but I sure as Hell would\u2019ve called her out for her shit behavior. \n\nThen spoken to the boy in private that if he ever needs an adult to give him support he can stop by any time. And give him my number to call in case of emergencies", "absolutely N.T.A, periodt", "Yes! Make sure she learns early before she becomes the sort of person people don't want to date.", "This! Make it a teaching moment for your kid. Empathy is tough for teenagers. The best thing that you can do is to use real examples such as this to teach life lessons. The lessons here are:\n\n1 - Situational awareness/others' circumstances - ask her if she ever noticed that he never ate anything. If not, these are the types of things she should be paying attention to in order to learn not to be self absorbed. If she did notice, then:\n\n2 - critical thinking - did she ever ask herself why he wasn't eating? TBH kids are not learning how to connect the dots much these days.\n\n3 - informed decision-making - she accused you of some pretty harsh things without knowing all the facts. You need to drive this one home. What if she were to loudly say that at school about her mom dating a 14yo? A teacher overhears this (mandatory reporter) and your life could be turned upside-down in an instance. She needs to learn this lesson Hard.\n\n4 - a broader view about privilege and disparities in the real world - it sounds like you are well off or comfortable and your daughter probably has a pretty nice life. She needs to understand that this can lead to privileged ways of thinking in life that only serve to widen the socioeconomic gaps that are already ridiculous.\n\nI have a 14yo, and I feel like the next 4 years are about preparing for the real world by teaching as many life lessons as possible. When you can relate real world issues to a situation your teen is involved in, I feel like the lessons are much more impactful.", "That's a good question. She is young so it could be she doesn't know the signs to look for, and I doubt he would straight out tell her. On the other hand though, I do think 14 is old enough to recognize these things, so I may just ask her.", "Oh, I didn't think I was the asshole for feeding him. And I know her reaction was overblown, but that's normal at her age. I'm only doubting myself as far as taking her boyfriend out for dinner one-on-one, if I think back to when I was her age that might've made me upset so I try to see it from her perspective, too.", "Op did something nice, Wendy's is better than peanut butter and jelly.\nThe daughter's reaction is not ops fault.", "I agree! I think you should talk to her. She was pretty unfair and although 14 is old enough, she is still a young teen. I remember when I got my first bf, I wished he bought me things and him not having money never crossed my mind even though it was so obvious.", "oh ya if i was her i'd definitely have some dumb shit to say about it.  But at the end of the day, you fed a hungry child. How can you question that?", "I dont think your daughter has any clue what it's like to not have enough food to eat. And that's good...she shouldn't. But I think you should have a discussion with her about poverty and maybe take her to volunteer at a at a food bank or something. This is a learning opportunity for her.", "NTA at all. We need more people like you and Felix in the world. He sounds amazing for wanting to pay for their dates. I will say that I'm a firm believer that girls also pay. So maybe in future they could take turns? \n\nYour daughter is young and might not realise the situation. I would chat with her and suggest she apologise to Felix.", "You have good intentions. But you can give money to your daughter ask her to pay the bill. It's ok for a girl to pay the bill. NTA", "NTA, you helped him and your daughter didnt taught if it that way, its not your fault but tour daughter's", "Wtf is wrong with your daughter that she would be \\*checks notes*  JEALOUS of her own mother's motives with her 14 year old boyfriend? \n\nSomething is really messed up there. \n\nNTA", "NTA but woman (i guess you are a woman) raise your daughter! Because your daughter behaved like an ah. 14 is young but old enough to have a serious discussion about how to behave, about compassion, about money and about making drama when there is none (like accusing mom of being interested in the 14 year old boyfriend ....)", "It's time to have the, \"some people have less than us and some people have more. Felix has less, and in these situations it's kind to adjust your activities. Why not ask Felix over for dinner and cook for him or you two can cook together? I can teach you some simple recipes. And after you both can go for a walk or watch a film on the couch\". Technically nta but I understand why your teenage daughter interpreted the situation as you trying to sabotage her date night for inexplicable reasons. So ESH for that, although that wasn't your intention", "Decency?\n\nKindness?\n\nBro was hungry. Op did a solid. \n\nYou the daughter? \n\nNTA", "14 is old enough to not be a total asshole", "She said \u201earound her boyfriends\u201c.\nI guess that is not a serious relationship. And she sounds like a AH\u2026\n\nI hope Felix doesn\u2019t get ridiculed since she doesn\u2019t want to have a poor boyfriend", "Yeah, she definitely reacted very rudely to him (and absurdly to you to think that you took him out on a \"date\") but it does sound like she doesn't realize why you even did this. Imagine if your mom decided to join your date out of the blue, and then took the boy out after you bailed. Your daughter definitely didn't act nicely, but I bet it comes mostly out of confusion. A good talk might help a lot, and could also teach her some empathy towards others when she doesn't know their full situation."]}
