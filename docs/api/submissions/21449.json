Greg has two children, ages 5 and 7. I have no children, but one 50 lb dog. Each of our individual places is too small for everyone to live in together, so we\u2019re looking for a new place altogether. \n\nI love Greg\u2019s kids to pieces, but I am a naturally quiet, introverted person that enjoys peace, quiet, and solitude. I also get extremely anxious and uncomfortable in situations that are over stimulating to me in one way or another (too much noise, too much clutter, etc). I wish that wasn\u2019t how I act, but I can\u2019t just wish my mental illness away. I know a lot of this will understandably be sacrificed when living with young children, which is why I want a place in the house that the kids are absolutely not allowed. I\u2019m not talking about an entire floor or wing\u2026just maybe that small random bedroom that a lot of homes have and people tend to turn into offices or something. Also worth noting, Greg\u2019s kids are quite messy and irresponsible, even for their ages. I\u2019m talking full blown meltdowns when they\u2019re told to simply pick up after themselves. \n\nGreg thinks it is completely unacceptable and that it isn\u2019t fair to keep children out of a certain part of their own home, especially when the dog is allowed to go wherever she wants and the kids live with their mom 50% of the time. I think that I\u2019m already meeting him at least halfway by just requesting one room that isn\u2019t covered in graham cracker dust. It\u2019s not necessarily their presence that can wear my down, but all of their stuff and mess (and sometimes noise). I offered that this could also be a space for him that he didn\u2019t have to let the dog into if he didn\u2019t want. We got into an argument about it and he said he didn\u2019t think it was fair to pay for an extra bedroom for me to sit in and be selfish, and then I said I didn\u2019t think it was fair that I had to pay for extra space for HIS kids (which I do feel bad about saying). \n\nAm I being unreasonably demanding?

There is nothing wrong with wanting a space in your home that is a child free space.", "NTA - my parents had a space that was off-limits to kids, it was called their bedroom. \n\nIt's natural for people to need space and while you love your BF and his kids, you need some space for yourself.  There is nothing wrong with that and you communicated it.   Maybe you could compromise and have the bedroom be your quiet space that no kids or dogs are allowed.  That would nullify his argument and the kids won't feel left out because no one is allowed in there except their dad and you.

Your request isn't unreasonable, but your partner's isn't either. Your partner wants to raise his children in a home where they feel no space is off access to them. This is a part of your partner's parenting style and the type of enivornment he wants to create for his children. You want to live in a home where there is one space that you can call your own. Where his children will not be allowed. Your request isn't unreasonable either. I don't think there is compromise when it comes to what makes for a peaceful home enivorment. You each have your own ideas of what that is. I don't think a parent should sacrafice or alter the way they want to raise their children to appease a partner who doesn't have children. Nor do I think you should have to sacrafice your peace or comfort for someone else children. I think maybe you shouldn't move into right now. Maybe you can revist it when the children are older.", "NTA but I think you need to delay moving in together.

Will you be the one getting them ready for school?  Back off from moving in with him.  Tell him you will when the kids are a little older and more self-sufficient.  But for now, you both need your space, you for your mental health and for him to be a full-time dad when he has his kids.", "NTA even if they were your biological children, if you need space, you need space otherwise you'll go crazy.

I couldn't imagine having to spend time with kids or anyone without breaks.

It doesn't always improve with age so if you're banking on it being short term I'd really think hard about if this is fair on the children", "Nope, NTA - it's completely appropriate to need your own space.

He feels that you get a break from the kids when they\u2019re with their mom so when they\u2019re at your house, you should be fine being around them during their entire visit. It sounds like you both have different ideas of the role you\u2019ll play in the kids\u2019 lives when you\u2019re all living together. You should probably put your plans to live together on hold until you can figure this out.", "NTA,\nImo this is a reasonable request but if he thinks his kids need to have free rein with no boundaries \u2026.

Im just grateful they are good respectful young men and hope they continue to be. I do have two older bonus daughters who are 25 and 26 and we talk EVERYDAY lol so I hope it turns that way with the boys too once they are adult.
