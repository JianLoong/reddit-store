We have a big yard and garden, and he'll go out there a lot to read or just mess around. \n\nNow our neighbors yard is about 100 feet away, and there's these little patch of trees between us, but we don't have fences so you can see into eachothers yards. We don't really talk or know eachother, but he's got two daughters a bit younger than my son. \n\nThe other week, neighbor comes and says my son is making his daughters uncomfortable. I asked if he did anything, and he says no not like that, it's just he sort of intimidates them hanging around the yard. I talked with my son and he confirmed he never even looks in that direction, he never talks to them or even heard or saw them being uncomfortable.\n\nSo I had a talk with my son eariler than I expected to. I told him that sometimes, people are going to be uncomfortable around him. That isn't his fault or their fault, we just need to respect other people, and make sure we aren't imposing ourselves on others. I get it, I'm a big guy. I have to cross the street all the time because women will speed up when they see me, which I completely understand. Hell I even try to stay in more to avoid that.\n\nSo I told my son that I'm not mad, but he probably shouldn't linger out in the yard alone anymore. He was upset but understood. My wife is furious, she says I should've talked to her first (and she's right on that front) and that our sone hasn't done anything.

There are other things you could have done: build a fence, plant some tall bushes/trees, tell your neighbour that your son is doing absolutely nothing wrong and he needs to only interfere should he do something, educate the neighbour on what is acceptable neighbour behaviour (and saying a child \u201ccan\u2019t go outside\u201d is not acceptable), ask him to educate his children or better yet introduce them to him so they can see he is just a tall child.", "YTA\n\n\nHear me out. I commend you for taking women's fear into account in your everyday life, and that you want to instill repsect in your son and make him aware that he may be seen as a threat. HOWEVER -\n\nYour son has done nothing, absolutely nothing that would make him a threat. In fact, according to your words, all he does is hanging out on YOUR property, minding his own business. Telling him now that he needs to keep himself inside because your neighbor feels threatened by a boy doing nothing in his own parent's backyard, is basically telling him that his very existence is a threat to everyone around him. He may grow up resenting you, and everyone else. How will he learn how to approach a girl if all he learns is that he's a threat? You're raising him to become a recluse, or worse - a misogynist incel.\n\n\nPlease don't do that. It's your property. Your son needs to be allowed to roam YOUR property freely. \n\n\nInstead, teach your son respect for the other gender and respect for everyone else, not fear. Teach him consent. Don't teach him that he needs to hide himself, he's gonna think something's wrong with him.\n\n\nLast, but not least, your neighbor needs to mind his business. Stand up for your son, and for yourself. Why do you let an outsider dictate you and your family when and how to use your backyard?", "\"Hey son, you're weird looking, so don't go out to your yard in your own home anymore.\" YTA, next time tell your neighbors to teach their kids not to judge based on looks.", "ESH\n\nYou and the neighbour. Ask yourself, is my son intimidating, or are they intimidated? He\u2019s 13. Don\u2019t make him feel like a villain when he\u2019s literally just existing. And you staying home as a service to others? It\u2019s not, no one notices and no one cares. Your wife is right. \n\nA better way to fix this would have been to bring your son over to introduce them and prove he\u2019s just a random kid and nothing to be afraid of.", "What is the point of having a yard and not enjoying it?! Tell your neighbors to tell their daughters not to pry through their windows to your yard! YTA", "The more people cave to \"your doing absolutely nothing but you make me uncomfortable so leave\" the more it will happen.\n\nSay to your neighbour sorry, but my kid has the same rights as yours to hang out in HIS backyard. It is unreasonable to punish someone for not doing anything - the punishment being he cannot hangout in his own yard.", "YTA. Jesus christ, he\u2019s a child! The way society treats teenage boys is downright fucking *criminal*. He\u2019s not making them uncomfortable, their reaction is their own problem, and treating a child as a potential predator (in fact lets be truthful: as a confirmed predator who hasn\u2019t been caught) is so fucking disgustingly out of line\u2026and you just let them. You in fact *reenforced to him* that their reaction to him is normal and appropriate. \n\nSeek therapy. Do better.", "YTA tell the neighbour to build a fence. Your son is entitled to being in his home and yard just as much as the neighbours daughters are", "YTA. If the neighbors are uncomfortable with your son that should be their problem not his, he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong and not letting him be in his own yard is ridiculous.", "Your son has very right to be able to enjoy time in his yard, reading or getting fresh air. If he was leering at the girls, I could understand making him stay inside. \n\nThe analogy you used was to crossing the street so as not to scare women as you come up behind them (thank you for doing this, as a woman much appreciated). However, this is not a good analogy as crossing the street is a temporary inconvenience, one that might cost you a few seconds crossing over than crossing back every now and then. Prohibiting your son from ever going into the yard in HIS OWN HOME is permanently inconveniencing him. It is putting him to great discomfort over something that it has not clear why the girls feel discomfort over if he is not looking at them or interacting with them in any way.\n\nA good compromise to put to your neighbour would be to offer to split the cost of a privacy fence. This will benefit your son too - preventing him being annoyed by the children next door while he is trying to read his books too.", "If this actually happened YTA. Go talk to your son, explain that you thought it over and took the wrong spin on this, he has the right to sit in his yard and read, to stand in his yard and play with a ball, just to be outside on a property that belongs to his family. Then apologize to him. Next time your neighbor shows up at your door tell him if he's so concerned about his children being \"uncomfortable\" then he needs to keep them inside because your son has done nothing and will do nothing. He is not interested in said neighbor's daughters. Then send the man on his way. Don't forget to apologize to your kid, and your wife while you're at it.\n\nEdit: typo.", "YTA. Your kid deserves to be protected and to feel safe in his own yard. You just told him that it\u2019s not safe to be in his own backyard because others will perceive him to be a creep. You majorly failed your son here.", "Congratulations on not loving your son. My father did this to me when I was 15 and he believed the girl over his own son. From that day forward I always knew my dad didn't believed me or loved me. I have no relationship with him at all. he's just a friend of a family member in my eyes. \n\nYTA", "YTA Holy shit how are you siding with your neighbours on this. Are you *trying* to make your son unwelcome in his own home?\n\nIf *they* feel uncomfortable, it's up to *them* get comfortable. Perhaps they could try ... talking to him?", "YTA you shouldn't punish people for things they can't control.", "I think in trying to do the right thing, you've done exactly the wrong thing. Soft yta.", "YTA. What the f##k is wrong with you? The neighbours being uncomfortable by your son spending time in his own backyard is their problem and they should stay out of their yard not your son who is doing NOTHING WRONG.", "YTA but from a trying NTBTAH position \n\nas many others have said your son isnt doing anything wrong its simply a perception of him that is being used to generate anxiety. \n\nyour neighbours TAH for even suggesting you cant use your land for your own family.", "YTA. I can't believe you wouldn't defend your son when he has done nothing wrong.", "Yta\n\nYou are a horrible father.", "OP, I am sorry that so many think YTA, but I disagree. It is a case of \u201cwhat should be vs what is.\u201d  My husband is a big man - and a sweetheart.  It took him a while to understand that, although he didn\u2019t intend threatening actions, when arguing with someone over a foot shorter, that person could be easily intimidated.  When the person was a woman, an introverted woman\u2026 well, the scene just gets worse. My husband had to learn to be very careful. Things like \u2026 never stand and argue with a woman. Honestly, you think that is stupid; however, I assure you that is a real concern.  I am sorry that you had to have that discussion with your son,  but you did.", "Exactly this.\n\nThis is so sad. From kindergarten on up, I heard that either my race, size, or body caused some discomfort for someone else. How is this any different from telling a young girl who\u2019s hit puberty that her body makes people uncomfortable? You\u2019re giving your son a complex about himself. As a father, you should have put the neighbor in his place. Your son has every right to exist peacefully and carefree, especially in his own yard. YTA.", "I\u2019m as feminist as they come and YTA. You and your neighbor dad. Way to go for making a kid feel like a creep.", "Well said. Also, switch the sexes - I've read so many stories here where a woman is told to not be outside in their garden as they're \"a distraction\"? It's a similar vein as this. All OP's son is doing is minding his own business outside. OP, your neighbour is an entitled asshole, and you need to do better by your son.", "I doubt OPs son makes the daughter uncomfortable. He probably makes the neighbor feel jealous and threatened though.", "Simply existing, in your own yard, no less, is not \u201cimposing yourself\u201d on people, ffs. \n\nIt sounds like OP has some internalized misandry. He  might benefit from talking to a therapist. YTA.", "He's not even particularly tall. 5'10 is not some imposing monster stomping around the yard, it's a pretty average size man.", ">You just taught your son that his sheer presence makes people feel uncomfortable\n\nIt does suck and it is shitty but it is also a part of reality for men. The only thing here that makes him shitty is that it's his fucking yard and it shouldn't matter how the neighbors feel. In public though, as a big guy my self I can't really disagree with dad here.", "This is the best response. It\u2019s good that dad taught his son about respecting other peoples\u2019 comfort, but the son also deserves respect and comfort. If the dad is keeping the son inside because he doesn\u2019t want the neighbors making false accusations, then he should put a security cam in the backyard so that 1) his son always has proof that he didn\u2019t do anything to the neighbors or 2) if the neighbors harass the son, it\u2019s all on video.", "\nIf the neighbors are bothered by it, they should put up a fence themselves. It's not OP's son problem if they feel uncomfortable just because he's in his own backyard.", "ogre", "dogs should not be outside without a leash, or at least a fence. they don't know how to stay on their owner's property, and no amount of training will make them.", "There\u2019s no difference. I\u2019m saying OP\u2019s son is entitled to use his backyard as he pleases. However, if a woman crosses the street when she sees him, OP\u2019s son should respect that and be understanding. It\u2019s not about his height.", "My dude your son did nothing wrong should have stood up for him"]}
