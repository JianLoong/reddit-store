Both my wife and I are tall, but he's set to pass me since he's 5'10\" and well built. He's a great kid, and I've never suspected him of saying or doing anything bad. We have a big yard and garden, and he'll go out there a lot to read or just mess around. \n\nNow our neighbors yard is about 100 feet away, and there's these little patch of trees between us, but we don't have fences so you can see into eachothers yards. We don't really talk or know eachother, but he's got two daughters a bit younger than my son. \n\nThe other week, neighbor comes and says my son is making his daughters uncomfortable. I asked if he did anything, and he says no not like that, it's just he sort of intimidates them hanging around the yard. I talked with my son and he confirmed he never even looks in that direction, he never talks to them or even heard or saw them being uncomfortable.\n\nSo I had a talk with my son eariler than I expected to. I told him that sometimes, people are going to be uncomfortable around him. That isn't his fault or their fault, we just need to respect other people, and make sure we aren't imposing ourselves on others. I get it, I'm a big guy. I have to cross the street all the time because women will speed up when they see me, which I completely understand. Hell I even try to stay in more to avoid that.\n\nSo I told my son that I'm not mad, but he probably shouldn't linger out in the yard alone anymore. He was upset but understood. My wife is furious, she says I should've talked to her first (and she's right on that front) and that our sone hasn't done anything.

If he was extra short and they had issues would you send him inside?\n\nYou owe your son some back up and an spology", "I feel bad for both you and your son that you have to go through that. But, sadly, the real ah here is our overly reactive society thinking everyone and everything is bad, dangerous or questionable. YTA for feeding into that mindset by telling your son to limit his outdoor time, but you\u2019re NTA for the real problem \u2014 the girls are for reacting the way they did.", "YTA \nHe is a child doing nothing but what a child likes to do. \nTell them to build a fence. And a bridge for them to get over it.", "YTA, tell your neighbour to go fuck themselves, your son hadn't done anything and until he does do something the neighbour can sit down and shut up.", "YTA", "YTA. Way to show your son you\u2019re just gonna let people judge him for just existing. \u201cYour son looks intimidating so therefore must be dangerous\u201d sound really close to \u201cshe was wearing skimpy clothes so she was asking for it\u201d in both cases the person is just trying to exist normally but others interpretation is ruining it", "YTA, what\u2019s next? You\u2019re gonna complain about him being indoors all the time? Why the hell are you letting your neighbor control what your son does on your own property? God parents are whack as hell.", "YTA & so is your neighbor.", "YTA you have told a child he cannot use, or be in part of his own home for the sake of others who have no ownership or say over that space. Your child is your priority, not other people. You only hear what the father of the girls thinks, not the girls. He shouldn't have to change who he is in his own back yard. Do better.", "You son chilling out in his own back yard doing nothing wrong is not \u201cimposing\u201d on anyone. If your neighbour has a problem then they should build a fence. YTA", "YTA because I think you over corrected. There's a sense of what you're thinking about giving women space because you're a big guy, and having that sort of social awareness is good. But your son shouldn't have to avoid his own yard because of his size. Your neighbor needs to have a talk with his kids, or if they're very young, not let them out in his yard all by themselves. My 4yo is nervous around unfamiliar people just in general but I don't tell people that or force them to stay away from us. Your kid has the right to hang out in his yard, you need to fix that and speak with the neighbor if they still have a problem.", "Build a fence\u2026 better yet tell neighbor to build the fence\u2026even better yet but probably too late now get to know your neighbors so kids are friends", "1 post and zero comments on a newly created account....fake.", "YTA, but a soft one cuz I get you were trying to do your best.", "YTA. As a big guy myself, I would have told the neighbor where to stick it. Also, crossing the street when walking by a woman? That also makes you an asshole.", "Well, that last sentence was unnecessary, but I agree with the rest enough to still upvote you.", "This. \n\nIn the absence of any kind of actual inappropriate behaviour, why TF shouldn\u2019t he be allowed in his own yard? Either the neighbour provides evidence of that behaviour or she STFU.", "While we are at it.. maybe we should all be staying inside with our curtains closed so nobody in the whooooole wide world can take offense of our presence\u2026 \n/s obviously", "Also the 'big guys need to avoid intimidating women' is just a totally wrong take from my perspective. It's not about height or size for us! Like if a guy is walking behind me at night on a lonely road, I'm going to be shitting myself whether he's 5'7 or 6'2. (Side note, guys who cross the street when walking behind me to let me know I'm safe have my heart). What makes a male stranger 'scary' is when they're being purposefully scary, independent of height, or if we're in an isolated/nighttime situation beyond both of our control. I would never ever expect a man to not enjoy his own space.", "ESH? What did the son do wrong except be born to an awful parent?", "Yeah. Agreed that ESH except wife and son. I think they should introduce the son and the neighbor's daughters. Maybe have the neighbors over for dinner or something. Make friends. Then when the girls see the son, or he sees them, they can wave and say \"hi\" and go about their business.", "OP is 100% the asshole to his son by trying to make him hide.", "Nah, he is the asshole for treating his son that way. Best to just ignore the neighbors. His son has every right to be outside in his own yard.", "I thought that meant the son was already 1m77 at 13. I would expect a kid of that size to continue growing into quite a tall adult, no?\n\nStill, that doesn't mean he can't just enjoy their own backyard!\nOP is clearly YTA", "Man, I did that once and it went sooo wrong!\n\nWalking home one night about 10-15m behind a young woman who was obviously scared. You could see the tension in her shoulders and she kept glancing behind her. So I thought \u201cI know what I\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll cross the road and walk faster, so she sees me on the other side and clearly not following her\u201d\n\nSo I did that. Poor thing didn\u2019t see me do that. So she also crossed, took two or three more steps, turned and saw me still on the same side as her, but now only 5m behind her. I think she almost had a heart attack, bless her!\n\nI felt so bad, but didn\u2019t know what to do, so I just kept walking fast so as to overtake her so at least she could see me in front and walking away from her. I hope it was the right choice!", "Exactly this. Also, if the neighbors are so concerned, there are such things as privacy blinds for windows.\n\nAlso, OP...YTA", "Its his fucking yard? No wonder the girls are uncomfortable.", "It's an imposed reality.", "But thats literally how the real world works. I know it sounds wild, but its what I can say ive seen with my own two eyes and experienced myself. Its not bad advice, its just not advice people like to hear.", "I can, but youre correct all my life my confidence has been traaaaash. Didnt stop me from doing things, but made me very hyperaware of myself which in itself is rough \ud83e\udd23", "Why don't you just tell your neighbor to fence their yard if they're uncomfortable with your son existing in his own yard?", "Great job, your son now knows he can't ever count on you to support him.", "Dude-tell your neighbor he\u2019s being ridiculous.   \n\n\nHow do the kids not know each other? Being neighbors they should be on some terms of saying hi and waving to each other at least", "Clearly you\u2019ve never seen livestock dogs work", "Okay, I'll respect their freedom to cross the street to get away from me, but I'm sure as shit not gonna let anyone tell me I should do it instead. If my literal only offense is *existing*, well... What is it the kids these days say... \"sorry-not-sorry\"?", "Uhh, where did I say you should cross the street?"]}
