Both my wife and I are tall, but he's set to pass me since he's 5'10\" and well built. He's a great kid, and I've never suspected him of saying or doing anything bad. We have a big yard and garden, and he'll go out there a lot to read or just mess around. \n\nNow our neighbors yard is about 100 feet away, and there's these little patch of trees between us, but we don't have fences so you can see into eachothers yards. We don't really talk or know eachother, but he's got two daughters a bit younger than my son. \n\nThe other week, neighbor comes and says my son is making his daughters uncomfortable. I asked if he did anything, and he says no not like that, it's just he sort of intimidates them hanging around the yard. I talked with my son and he confirmed he never even looks in that direction, he never talks to them or even heard or saw them being uncomfortable.\n\nSo I had a talk with my son eariler than I expected to. I told him that sometimes, people are going to be uncomfortable around him. That isn't his fault or their fault, we just need to respect other people, and make sure we aren't imposing ourselves on others. I get it, I'm a big guy. I have to cross the street all the time because women will speed up when they see me, which I completely understand. Hell I even try to stay in more to avoid that.\n\nSo I told my son that I'm not mad, but he probably shouldn't linger out in the yard alone anymore. He was upset but understood. My wife is furious, she says I should've talked to her first (and she's right on that front) and that our sone hasn't done anything.

HOWEVER -\n\nYour son has done nothing, absolutely nothing that would make him a threat. In fact, according to your words, all he does is hanging out on YOUR property, minding his own business. Telling him now that he needs to keep himself inside because your neighbor feels threatened by a boy doing nothing in his own parent's backyard, is basically telling him that his very existence is a threat to everyone around him. He may grow up resenting you, and everyone else. How will he learn how to approach a girl if all he learns is that he's a threat? You're raising him to become a recluse, or worse - a misogynist incel.\n\n\nPlease don't do that. It's your property. Your son needs to be allowed to roam YOUR property freely. \n\n\nInstead, teach your son respect for the other gender and respect for everyone else, not fear. Teach him consent. Don't teach him that he needs to hide himself, he's gonna think something's wrong with him.\n\n\nLast, but not least, your neighbor needs to mind his business. Stand up for your son, and for yourself.

I would not confine my sons for the comfort of neighbors. I wish the whole world could move as freely as white men can without fear of bodily harm. I don't think men should prioritize others' comfort over their own, but I DO think they should be very aware of privilege, especially white men, and the fact that they are mainly entitled to move freely about the earth as they please without fear of bodily harm by the state or vigilantes that think they are acting on behalf of the state.\n\nI go about this by explicitly teaching feelings to my sons and when my 4 year old confessed to partaking in a group of other boys making fun of a girl in their class, I processed that with him, and we practiced upstander instead of bystander responses. I am sure I would be banned in the state of Florida, which would suit me just fine.\n\nTo be clear, I love my white sons. I think they're incredible humans and I cannot wait to see the people they grow to be.

Other times, he might want to be aware of his size for his own safety, like interacting with cops or in emotionally charged situations where him being upset might be seen as scarier than a smaller person upset. \n\nBut hanging out in his own back yard should not be a situation where he has to feel like a big scary monster that\u2019s terrorizing people just by existing while larger than average.

There are low effort ways he can try to minimize that, or at least make sure he\u2019s not contributing to it through his behavior, but it\u2019s not fair to him to expect him to completely avoid innocent things he enjoys because of the assumptions other people make about him based on how he looks.", "I would say not the asshole, but also, not the best reaction you could've had. \n\nIt's not right to make your son uncomfortable in his own yard, to make other people more comfortable.
