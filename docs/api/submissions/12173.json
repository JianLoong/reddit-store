Both my wife and I are tall, but he's set to pass me since he's 5'10\" and well built. He's a great kid, and I've never suspected him of saying or doing anything bad. We have a big yard and garden, and he'll go out there a lot to read or just mess around. \n\nNow our neighbors yard is about 100 feet away, and there's these little patch of trees between us, but we don't have fences so you can see into eachothers yards. We don't really talk or know eachother, but he's got two daughters a bit younger than my son. \n\nThe other week, neighbor comes and says my son is making his daughters uncomfortable. I asked if he did anything, and he says no not like that, it's just he sort of intimidates them hanging around the yard. I talked with my son and he confirmed he never even looks in that direction, he never talks to them or even heard or saw them being uncomfortable.\n\nSo I had a talk with my son eariler than I expected to. I told him that sometimes, people are going to be uncomfortable around him. That isn't his fault or their fault, we just need to respect other people, and make sure we aren't imposing ourselves on others. I get it, I'm a big guy. I have to cross the street all the time because women will speed up when they see me, which I completely understand. Hell I even try to stay in more to avoid that.\n\nSo I told my son that I'm not mad, but he probably shouldn't linger out in the yard alone anymore. He was upset but understood. My wife is furious, she says I should've talked to her first (and she's right on that front) and that our sone hasn't done anything.

Where you do nothing wrong (as is the case with your son) you should not model behaviour that leaves him thinking he is at fault for others feelings about him for just existing or being in the same general area. This will only lead him to see himself as responsible for things he is not responsible for and develop self resentment. \n\nRestricting him is a complete dick move and demonstrates incredibly bad behaviour.

You now know and honestly I wouldn\u2019t put it past AH neighbor and daughters to make up stuff if they ever got the hankering. Come on your son was just hanging out in the yard and the girls became nervous", "INFO:  race of your son and the neighbors family?", "NTA  but, you are wrong. What you are doing is in a place of respect and consideration. It is not your son's responsibility to be able to read other people's minds and to accommodate their triggers without knowing them. He should be free and welcome to sit in his yard and garden and enjoy the sunshine and life. If the girls are uncomfortable then they should go inside. They need to understand that the world does not revolve around them.", "NTA but time for a privacy fence.", "NTA. Neighbors are making a mountain out of a mole hill. They need to put up more trees or a tall fence to obscure their yard more. Yes you probably should've told your wife but what's done is done. Perhaps introducing yourselves to the neighbors would solve the problem to some extent, but what would their daughters do if they ended up at school with your son? It's not like they can avoid him if they had classes together or at least in the same building.", "NAH.  You're good for explaining everything to your son, but he is also allowed to hang out in his own yard.  The neighbors daughters might be causing some drama here, but that's not really possible to tell.", "YTA. If anything, I'd have a talk with my neighbor about asking his daughters why they're afraid of a thirteen year old boy who wasn't doing anything to/at them. Your son should feel comfortable in the one place he's supposed to be safe; home. It's his home. So now he can't be outside in the fresh air in his backyard because the daughters of a neighbor are 'uncomfortable' around him? They're younger than him. So that's what, 12? 10? What the hell are 10 year olds doing being uncomfortable around a 13 year old?\n\nThis sounds more like the parent is uncomfortable with a boy around their girls and is using them as an excuse. Poorly.\n\nPlease don't tell your kid he shouldn't feel safe in his own space. And please maybe consider putting up a fence or some kind of barrier, or possibly suggesting it to the neighbor. \"Please explain to me what it is my minor son is doing that is such an issue that you want me to... what exactly? Do I get to not hang out in the backyard either because I'm an older male? Where does this stop?\"", "Yta I can\u2019t even come up with words to tell you how much of an ass you are", "YTA. Get some cameras on the back and side yards so your son has proof that he didn't do anything. So, when those neighbors come back, you can tell them \"up yours, I have video proof and I'll sue for harassing a minor.\"", "YTA and your neighbor is too. Poor kid is just minding his business in the yard and your telling him he can\u2019t be outside anymore like he\u2019s committed some crime.", "Uhhhhh. I\u2019m trying not to find this funny, but you essentially told your son not to go out and get fresh air and sunlight in his own yard because it bothers the neighbors. But like\u2026 he\u2019s not doing anything.\n\nI appreciate that you\u2019re trying to be conscientious and teach your son to be respectful. But there\u2019s such a thing as overcorrecting, and this is it. It would be different if he was doing something to bother them or staring or intruding on their property, but he\u2019s not. And like\u2026. he has a right to exist in his own family\u2019s yard.\n\nSoft YTA because I really do think you have good intentions, but I honestly kind of think you owe your son an apology, too.", "The neighborhood needs to tell his daughters that the world isn\u2019t going to change to make them feel more comfortable. Your son has a right at the very least the stand on his own property.", "So, there is a different from someone actually being a creep and making someone feel comfortable, someone that is either one full on themselves/conditioned (there are some girls who are) to believe that boys are all the same and will violate them. Which the truth is there are many people who for violate girls, but there are many who don\u2019t.\n\nA better solution if have you and the other dad be there and introduce your kids to each other, so they are at least not complete strangers to each other. It would probably help clear up the uncomfortable air between them.\n\nYTA", "YTA. It's a horrible message to teach your son that his very presence is something to be hidden, because he might make other people uncomfortable....why again? Because he is tall? Your wife is right to be furious. You and the neighbors are being horrible. He's allowed to exist in his own yard. If he makes other people uncomfortable just by existing, that's their problem, not his.", "ESH\n\nExcept your wife and son. \n\nThere is a huge difference between crossing a public street to keep form making a strange woman uncomfortable and NOT BEING ALLOWED TO EXIST ON YOUR OWN PROPERTY. \n\nHe\u2019s doing nothing wrong, their discomfort is their problem. He should be able to use his own yard comfortably. If they are uncomfortable with him just existing, in his own yard, minding his own business. Then they can build a fence.", "YTA.

This is one of most pathetic things I've heard.", "ESH except your son and wife. I am amazed at the gall of your neighbors who said your son\u2019s very existence makes their girls uncomfortable?!?

Can\u2019t linger in your own yard my ass.", "YTA,  a huge one. You basically told your son that he is and will always be intimidating to other people and that he should make himself small so that other people will be happy! Total abusive move", "YTA. since both sides have said he hasn't actually done anything the onus is on the neighbour to gather his/her girls and teach them. your son is way too young to be carrying around that \"I shouldn't be taking up this much space\" mentality. Don't destroy your child's confidence while trying to cater to other people's children", "YTA, if your son is truly doing nothing wrong. Your neighbor is an AH too.", "YTA. You literally admitted he wasn't doing anything wrong. Your neighbor is an asshole too. What are they going to do? Demand that all guys hide so they don't scare the daughters? Jeez. You are not a good parent in this instance and neither is that neighbor.", "If your neighbors are uncomfortable about a teenage boy who hasn't done anything just hanging around out on his family's property and fear for their daughters so much then ***THEY*** can build a tall privacy fence. **NOT** your son hiding away from the world because his mere presence makes someone uncomfortable for no actual reason.\n\nYTA\n\nHonestly do you not the BS your neighbor is spouting? What do they do when they go out in public and there are other 13 year old boys who look and dress similarly to your son? Do you think they're asking their parents to go hide them to make their sons leave while they're in a store? A restaurant? Parks? Movie theaters?\n\nYou're a parent who you should know well enough that it's unreasonable to try and bend the world to your kids so why does your get a pass for an incredibly unreasonable reason too?\n\nActually care for your son and be his advocate against looney adults like this that can cause him harm.", "YTA, let him live his life. You should tell your neighbors to teach their daughters to mind their own business. This is the same as dress coding girls at school. The girls did nothing wrong, but are being held responsible for how other people perceived them. This is wrong for boys or girls. Do better. Tell your neighbors to do better. Your boy deserves better parenting from you & more discussion with his mom involved.", "YTA. Why hurt your own child like that? You\u2019re so ashamed and it\u2019s so sad", "YTA - Tiny woman here.

But that's on me and my trauma. Never in my life would I expect a man to just... not be outside ON HIS OWN PROPERTY. And, he's a child, he hasn't done anything wrong. \nI think you mean well, but YTA for making your son feel like he should hide to make other people comfortable, like there's something wrong with him. \nAlso, the neighbor is definitely the AH.", "YTA  If they are uncomfortable why are they going out there when your son is there? Sounds like he makes the father uncomfortable. But you have it your way, teach your son to be an introvert and to avoid other people then when he hits his 20's he can get into therapy and figure out how messed up his father's way of thinking is.", "YTA\n\nYour son can't even hang out in his own backyard because of what someone else might think of him? Not even doing anything, just hanging out at his home?\n\nAll you are doing is teaching him to be ashamed of who he is, causing self-esteem issues at an age when kids are especially vulnerable to it.", "ESH except your son and wife.\n\nI hope your son has good insurance for all the therapy he'll need to get over the hang ups you're giving him.", "Wow you're a jerk...", "YTA. Tell your neighbor to put up a fence, your poor kid is being punished for existing. I\u2019m all for making women feel safe but he isn\u2019t even looking at them ffs.

Yes, sometimes strangers can be dangerous, but let's not start as though it's always the case.", "Going against the grain here, but I think this is a super reasonable discussion to have. It sounds like you approached it well and made sure he knew it's not his fault, just that we need to be aware of power differences in all relationships and interactions we have in the world. \n\nOnly thing I would add is considering inviting your neighbours and their kids around for a meal / BBQ / similar. A chance for your kids to get to know each other in a safe and comfortable environment might make them feel more comfortable, and make it more likely the kids wave at each other across the yards, rather than feel uncomfortable or frightened. \n\nNTA", "Your neighbors don't think that your son should be allowed to sit in his own back yard.

As in, he's doing nothing wrong; there's no wrong behavior that he can change here, because it's not wrong to simply be outside in one's own yard. People should be able to enjoy their own yards, actually.\n\nIt's definitely the neighbors' problem and maybe the parent of the daughters who are apparently uncomfortable should have a talk with his own daughters about how people have a right to enjoy their own space and that some people might *look* intimidating, but aren't actually so, and that's not something that they can control. They'll meet a lot of people who fit that description, and those people aren't just going to hide from them or disappear in the real world.\n\nI feel sorry for OP's son because it sounds like he's probably being made to feel like he's trapped inside for no real reason.", "My niece was always taller so people always thought she was older and that is wrong. Your son is a child of 13 if he looks over there maybe he wants to toss a ball or just read. I have 1 son and 3 girls if they said that and the neighbor said anything I would bring my son over and introduce the kids and let them know hey he is tall but he is 13 and you are 12 yo. He likes to read outside and if he looks over and y\u2019all are having fun playing a game he probably wishes he had someone to play with also. If he says something wrong or worrisome let your parents know and we will talk to him. I mean he can go outside to read or play by himself.

Boundaries are not for other people! If they are truly that uncomfortable when he's done nothing, they need to remove themselves from the situation. This is ridiculous.

Why should OP put up the money to make the neighbors feel more comfortable when the kid isn\u2019t doing anything wrong.", "I don't think this is tricky at all. People are allowed to exist, regardless of what they look like, and regardless of other people's \"comfort\" level.
