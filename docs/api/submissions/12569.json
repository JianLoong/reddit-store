I see why she would get mad, but you went through all the hassle to get it for her! Also, if she's so pressed about the gift card, I'd sell the funco pop and put the money into a gift card.", "NTA.

I figure if it's important, they'll leave a message.", "But you created the hassle by not answering your phone or calling them back in order to receive the item. I'm not sure who should rightfully get it, to be honest, but it's a little weird to be like \"I deserve it because I had to deal with the hassle I created that made you wait even longer.\"", "I get what you mean - But I wouldn\u2019t be mad about a $20 giftcard.\n\nI\u2019d be upset at my husband for not making any extra effort to make my day special.\n\nI mean shit, he could have just made her a card and told her \u201cYeah the ordering process has been a pain in the ass, You\u2019ll get your real gift soon!\u201d\n\nHis failure was not making her feel special, not giving her the \u201cwrong\u201d item. I hope that logic makes sense.\n\nIt feels like she focused in that aspect of it - and subsequently got mad.\n\nHe got her a gift with his money, that she received but because of the delay she felt entitled to $20 when that\u2019s kinda just not the spirit of gift giving anyways\n\nEDIT: Clarity, Grammar", "I get what you mean - You could have adjusted your plan if you knew the package would be delayed though!\n\nJust a thought.
