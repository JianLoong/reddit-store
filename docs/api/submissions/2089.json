{"id": 2089, "submission_id": "ysxsgm", "title": "AITA for telling my wife it's her own fault for not getting invited on a group trip?", "selftext": "Me (32M) and my wife (31F) have been together for about 6 years. We get along wonderfully and through everything, have never had any major fights except for one thing.\n\nI personally feel like my wife makes no effort to get along with my friends.\n\nNow to give context, all my friends and I went to the same university for undergrad (3 guys and 3 girls that are married). My wife is the only one that did not have this common trait of attending undergrad between the 8 of us, which is really not a big deal if you ask me.\n\nEarly on in our relationship, my friends would always try and be friendly to her and talk to her when we would mutually hang out. My wife was cordial, but you could tell that she was uncomfortable. I would speak with her about this, and she would always comment that she was an \u201coutsider\u201d to all of us.\n\nThis always personally made me slightly miffed because I felt that my friends always made an effort to include her and make sure that she wasn\u2019t singled out.\n\nThroughout the years, my wife would attend events with me but would seem distant and would sometimes skip group events to hang with her college friends if she had something else planned. My friends never said anything but were always nice and treated her kindly.\n\nWell this week I got a group text from my friends about planning a group vacation to somewhere next year. I quickly noticed my wife wasn\u2019t on the group text and asked about it. I got a call from one of my friends who basically said that they didn\u2019t invite my wife because:\n\n1.\tBased on all the previous interactions they didn\u2019t think she would want to attend \n2.\tEven if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don\u2019t want it to ruin the vacation \n\nI thanked my friend for his honesty and told him I\u2019d think about it. And while I love my wife, I figured she more than likely wouldn\u2019t want to go on a vacation with them.\n\nSo I told my wife about the trip, and she asked about details. I told her that while I was invited, she wasn\u2019t, and it wasn\u2019t because of anything she did, but because they thought she wouldn\u2019t want to attend.\n\nWell this statement just seemed to about how she is an outsider. She said that because of the history us 7 had together, she had no chance of ever being a part of the group. She then went on a rant about how my friends are awful people and that she deserved to be invited even if she didn\u2019t want to be there because she is my wife.\n\nI sat there and listened to her vent and then finally I calmly told her that it was pretty much her own fault for not being invited, because she had taken such a hostile stance with them from the get go. She became a self fulfilling prophecy about being an outsider. That\u2019s paraphrasing but something along those lines. \n\nShe left the house and went to her mothers.\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to her in several days despite texts and phone calls to try and talk to her. I probably should have been more diplomatic about what I said, but I do feel my friends have been treated unfairly.

That's OK not everyone has to be buddy buddy.\n\nWhat's not OK is excluding someone's spouse from a trip where all the spouses are going. That's AH territory.\n\nThen you went and blamed your wife for their behaviour.\n\nWhat I would have done was assumed that your wife was probably right on the way she's claimed she's been treated.\n\nAlso it is really hard to break into a close knit friend group, you say they made an effort but based on this post it sounds like they might have made a very superficial attempt to be polite and your wife picked up on that.", "Why would you even want to go on a couples vacation, alone, with 3 other couples?

Your friends are actively excluding her and you're okay with it. I wonder how many times they did this in front of you where you just ignored it or made excuses for their behavior. Your friends don't seem like very good people. Why don't you make it fair and suggest they leave their wives at home.", "YTA for being willing to exclude your wife.\n\nYour friends don't make your decisions, you do. It sounds like there's more going on between your wife and friends then you're mentioning, or maybe more than you care to notice or take seriously which makes sense, since you don't seem to think them excluding her is serious. I bet she's brought up legitimate issues about them with you before. \n\nAlso, you've mentioned hanging out with her friends in the comments but I've only seen you mention the golfing with one couple, that's it. You have a friend group that's much larger and I bet the college buddies or college stories come up a lot when you hang out. Maybe compare the conversation her friends make with you vs. the conversation your friends make with her and see if there's a difference.", "YTA. This is your wife. She absolutely has been an outsider since day 1. You had 4 years of life and inside jokes with these people before her and it was your responsibility to help her fit in. You said your friends were nice to her, but there\u2019s inclusion and there\u2019s pity nice, how\u2019s the weather type of nice. I felt the same as your wife in my past relationship. Felt like he had a second life I was excluded from. He blamed me for not fitting in too but he did nothing to help. Just left me with the other females of the group. I\u2019m so glad that relationship ended. If you want to keep your wife you need to make drastic changes.", "Your friends who are three couples invited you on a trip and specifically excluded your wife? That\u2019s rude to both you and her, and YTA for then blaming your wife who indeed is treated as an outsider. You say she\u2019s always polite to them and sometimes has other plans, which is totally normal. I don\u2019t know why you aren\u2019t angry on your own behalf much less why you blame her for your insular friends not welcoming your wife even if just for you.", ">Even if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don't want it to ruin the vacation\n\nWhat the hell are you doing allowing your friends to get away with saying something like this about your partner?\n\nYou should have said no to the trip the second you found out they excluded your wife and taken your shitty friends to task for saying something so degrading about her.\n\nEven if my SO hated someone in my life, if a group of them all got together and deliberately excluded them but included me in a holiday then told me it's because they have a crappy attitude and ruined everyone's mood, I'd just defend them and refuse to go because this is all just horribly cruel, immature, and unfair.\n\nYour wife is right to be hurt and upset by these events. You're husband and wife, you're supposed to look out for one another, whether your partner's in the room or not, especially when they're not. So, why are prioritising your friend group and their exclusionary holiday over your spouse? And then you told her it was her fault as well. Smh.", "Sort of want to go with ESH, but you haven\u2019t explained how your wife has acted towards them, is she outwardly hostile to them or is she polite? If she\u2019s nice to them YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a hard one, I think it\u2019s strange to be ok with your friends not inviting your wife on a holiday and and not standing up for your wife is a dick move. It would be incredibly intimidating being the new person in a group of friends who have all known each other for many years and are married to each other, to say it\u2019s not a big deal is ridiculous! \nThat being said if she gave up on trying to be friends with your friends that is a bad move on her part considering they sound very important to you, if she\u2019s just accepted that she and them will only be friendly instead of friends that\u2019s kind of normal? Not everyone becomes best friends with their partners friends. You need to sort it out regardless because outright confirming to her that they don\u2019t like her is going to cause a bigger rift between them now. Honestly your friends need to grow up because that\u2019s your wife, you\u2019re a package deal, they can\u2019t just exclude her all the time. Unfortunately with you telling her this I don\u2019t see how she will get past it.", "YTA - so she was right all along. She is an outsider, they do exclude her and you are an active participant in this. \n\nDon\u2019t you dare go on this trip without your wife. That would be an absolute shitty thing to do to her.", "ESH. Your wife either dislikes your friends or is intimidated by your tight-knit-ness and that made her defensive from the get-go, but either way, she has not made any efforts to stop being an outsider. \n\nI know her position quite well, as my husband is very close with his group of friends from college, several of them also went to law school together and they have their own lawyer buddy sub-group. I was an outsider when I met them a little under ten years ago, but now, some of them I consider them friends myself, and I have a cordial although maybe not so close relationship with the rest (with exceptions, as my post history gives away hah). That didn't happen overnight, but they mostly made efforts to get to know me and include me, and I made the same effort to get to know them and integrate. Your wife didn't. She might have her reasons and she's not obligated to be friends with your friends, but she can't blame the distance solely on them. \n\nThat said, your friends absolutely crossed a line by inviting you and not your wife to a couples trip. That's beyond rude and classless of them. And you should've shut that down the moment you were told! Regardless of whether she'd like to go, she is your wife and it's completely inappropriate they exclude her. If anything they should've excluded you both and told you that they were sorry but since they didn't want her to come, neither of you was invited. It'd still be AH behavior but it wouldn't be as crass as inviting a man and not his wife to a trip with all married couples. \n\nFinally, your wife tried to express her feelings to you. It was an opportunity for communication and for maybe trying to see where the root of this distance between her and the friend group comes from. Instead, you used her vulnerability against her, told her it's all her fault, and quite literally took your friends' side over hers, when she is the one being excluded. \n\nEveryone is an AH here, but you need to rethink your priorities because you're putting your marriage second to your friendships.", "YTA - you \u201cfelt they made an effort\u201d and thought \u201cthey were always polite\u201d but obviously she\u2019s never felt included in the group, and you are still so caught up in how you perceive things and trying to decide how she should\u2019ve felt about it.", "YTA, and you should be doing some serious reflection on how you\u2019re treating your wife and her emotions. \n\nYou paint yourself as the picture of rationality here, but the story instead speaks to someone who simply doesn\u2019t care to understand the complexity of their partner feeling othered. \n\nINFO: What have you done to make your wife more comfortable with your friends? What have you asked of them? What have you changed, yourself? \n\nI\u2019m sorry her discomfort and attempts to compromise have caused you such grief. And I hope she respects herself enough to stop compromising, as she seems to be the only one making an attempt.", "YTA, it doesn't matter how your wife has behaved in the past to your friends, them not inviting YOUR WIFE on the trip is wrong, you 2 are a pair. You shouldn't have even entertained the idea after they excluded YOUR WIFE.", "NTA\n\nMaking friends is hard and requires effort... For 6 years your partner did not put any effort in.\n\nReap wat you saw.... And she didn't saw anything!\n\nPs. My partner has a bit the same, so i feel your struggle. Although in my case all partners are \"new friends\". And everybody gets along except my partner is \"always tired\". \n\nYour friends are right... If your partner *would* come along then it would be for the location and not for the friendship. And I bet it's the other way around for y'all. At least your partner should be honest and admit it's not about the people....\n\nNTA...

Honestly, your friends made the effort dozens of times it seems, every single time your wife would be there, from what it sounds like, they did make the most effort they could to talk to her.\n\nBut you can't talk to someone who isn't willing to, otherwise it's like pulling teeth and conversation seems forced into shallow subjects of \"how's the weather / hows the job\", etc. If you constantly make yourself an outsider in situations, you are going to be an outsider. \n\nThat being said, she *is* your wife and your friends know you two should be a package deal. Even if they don't like it, it's still a courtesy to extend the invitation towards your wife as well. \n\nESH and OP, I think in the future, or even now, you are probably facing a harsh reality and decision that will more than likely come down to your friends or your wife.", "YTA- it maybe that your wife is not comfortable because she doesn\u2019t have anything in common besides you with these friends? She doesn\u2019t get the inside jokes or references since she didn\u2019t go to the same school as you all? It could be completely innocent but still make her feel like not a part of the group. She should have been invited, but if she was not you should have said something since she is your wife.", "I'm going with NTA\n\nNot sure why there's so many YTA judgements but your wife literally had 6 years to be friendly with your friends. Yea, it hurts that she wasn't invited but when she's had 6 years to be friendly and hangout to get to know your friend group, there's no reason for her to be mad that she wasn't invited when she didn't make the effort other than \"being cordial\".", "YTA this is a vacation.

I have been in a similar position and it\u2019s frustrating when you feel like your SO isn\u2019t making an effort but you\u2019re not listening to her and you\u2019re just dismissing what she\u2019s saying. It is hard to fit in with a group that\u2019s known each other for a long time. Sometimes people are making an effort but they still can\u2019t force themselves to feel comfortable and that can be difficult to hide. It doesn\u2019t mean anything bad about your wife or your friends, it is what it is.\n\nThat said, I went into this story thinking there might be extenuating circumstances that make you not the asshole but there are none. Your friends are major assholes for putting you in this situation and it\u2019s them you should be mad at. You\u2019re an asshole for even considering this when it was explained to you.", "YTA You and your friends should have let her decide whether or not she wanted to go, not decide for her. Also, you should always be on her side. If she's not invited, you shouldn't go either.\n\nETA: If it's really true that you get along wonderfully except for this one issue, then maybe the two of you simply don't have a lot of experience with negotiating conflict. Maybe you should see a counselor together to work through this one issue.", "Major YTA. Just know if you go on this trip without your wife, that will lead to the path of your divorce.", "ESH you may have felt your friends were welcoming however she may not have felt the same as evidenced by her stating she felt like an outsider. Were you always with your wife at these gatherings or did you leave her to talk with them. Unless you were with her all the time you have no idea what was said or done when you weren\u2019t together. It is entirely possible they made her feel like an outsider. She should have been more direct in why she felt like an outsider however you should have asked as well. I know from experience that people can be friendly when their friends are around and then turn on the newcomer when they are alone. If you go on this couples trip without your wife you WBTA. The fact that your friends felt they could exclude her and that you seem ok with it tells me there is something being left out of the narrative either you\u2019re friends or yours", "YTA and so are your friends.  Not everyone has to be friends, but the fact that your wife is the only person excluded on a couples vacation proves that they are being exclusive.   Why do even want to go on a couples trip as the single guy?  Why do you think it\u2019s okay for your friends to basically insult YOUR WIFE to your face?  Your friends basically told a husband that his wife sucks, but hey, that\u2019s totally okay.  Would you be okay if your wife\u2018s friends said you suck, and she then thanked them for telling her that?  Plus, if your wife is always cordial, why is her attitude crappy and hostile?  Are you all in high school?  Does your wife need to be the life of the party, attend every event or act a certain way in order to be invited to a group function?  Because if she does, your friends sound more like a teenage clique than anything else.

Why choose your friend over her, and expect that she should ditch her friends for yours when it doesn't look like you would even ditch your friends for her?

It is not your fault you have old friends from before you met her and that you have history with them she can't share. That's life. Life is imperfect. She could have chosen to make a new chapter of history with them with you and her included; instead, she was a deliberate wet blanket and alienated herself further because she couldn't immediately participate in all of the group dynamics in exactly the same way, due to her being the most recent member.", ">She then went on a rant about how my friends are awful people and that she deserved to be invited even if she didn\u2019t want to be there because she is my wife.\n\nNTA jeez, they aren't entitled to invite her nor does she \"deserve\" it, knowing likely she won't come and if she does, she'll act crappy like she has in the past.

We get along wonderfully and through everything, have never had any major fights except for one thing.\n\nI personally feel like my wife makes no effort to get along with my friends.\n\nNow to give context, all my friends and I went to the same university for undergrad (3 guys and 3 girls that are married). My wife is the only one that did not have this common trait of attending undergrad between the 8 of us, which is really not a big deal if you ask me.\n\nEarly on in our relationship, my friends would always try and be friendly to her and talk to her when we would mutually hang out. My wife was cordial, but you could tell that she was uncomfortable. I would speak with her about this, and she would always comment that she was an \u201coutsider\u201d to all of us.\n\nThis always personally made me slightly miffed because I felt that my friends always made an effort to include her and make sure that she wasn\u2019t singled out.\n\nThroughout the years, my wife would attend events with me but would seem distant and would sometimes skip group events to hang with her college friends if she had something else planned. My friends never said anything but were always nice and treated her kindly.\n\nWell this week I got a group text from my friends about planning a group vacation to somewhere next year. I quickly noticed my wife wasn\u2019t on the group text and asked about it. I got a call from one of my friends who basically said that they didn\u2019t invite my wife because:\n\n1.\tBased on all the previous interactions they didn\u2019t think she would want to attend \n2.\tEven if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don\u2019t want it to ruin the vacation \n\nI thanked my friend for his honesty and told him I\u2019d think about it. And while I love my wife, I figured she more than likely wouldn\u2019t want to go on a vacation with them.\n\nSo I told my wife about the trip, and she asked about details. I told her that while I was invited, she wasn\u2019t, and it wasn\u2019t because of anything she did, but because they thought she wouldn\u2019t want to attend.\n\nWell this statement just seemed to about how she is an outsider. She said that because of the history us 7 had together, she had no chance of ever being a part of the group. She then went on a rant about how my friends are awful people and that she deserved to be invited even if she didn\u2019t want to be there because she is my wife.\n\nI sat there and listened to her vent and then finally I calmly told her that it was pretty much her own fault for not being invited, because she had taken such a hostile stance with them from the get go. She became a self fulfilling prophecy about being an outsider. That\u2019s paraphrasing but something along those lines. \n\nShe left the house and went to her mothers.\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to her in several days despite texts and phone calls to try and talk to her. I probably should have been more diplomatic about what I said, but I do feel my friends have been treated unfairly. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "INFO: OP I think we're missing some important information. Is there a reason why your wife doesn't get along with your friends? Are there significant personality differences? Is your wife an introvert or something? And perhaps are your friends much more extroverted? Do you think there's a chance that there's a chance that friends aren't as nice and welcoming as you say they are? Or does your wife think they do or say things that she finds objectionable? Does your wife simply have less friends or her friends aren't as close, so she feels a bit jealous and/or lonely? \n\nI'm asking these questions trying to figure out why your wife feels excluded and even if she does why it bothers her so much when she wasn't invited to join the vacation (which based on what you've said would make her miserable anyway).", "YTA. \n\nLet\u2019s say you go\u2026is it worth having your wife always resent you for it? Is it worth your partner being gone right now and later fighting with in the days before/after the trip? \n\nThis will drive a wedge between you two if you go. As it is, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s already hurting and thinking that you\u2019ve chosen people who didn\u2019t even want to invite her. \n\nActually, them not inviting her is a quite telling. Also, they invited you knowing that this could create an issue in your marriage. Their comfort (or whatever) meant more to them than sparing their boy this trouble. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t roll out an invite to one of my friends knowing what it could lead to\u2014it\u2019s common sense. If I was this uncomfortable with a friend\u2019s partner, I wouldn\u2019t invite either of them and spare them this shitshow.  \n\nMaybe you two should divorce and you find someone single closer to your friends circle? **A little sarcasm** \n\nRespectfully, this is absurd. You\u2019re married. Be the partner your wife needs you to be and tell your friends that, while you apologize that your wife isn\u2019t close to them, that you will not be going and that you hope that they\u2019ll respect your decision. Once you\u2019ve done that, call your wife and tell her that you love her and that you two will plan your own mini getaway.", "I\u2019m going to go with a soft ESH, but was almost NAH.\n\nSo for full disclosure OP for a good 70% of your post I almost wondered if my other half had written this post - then I got to the end and saw you had gone along with her not being invited on the trip!! Eek!\n\nMy other half has an incredibly tight knit group of uni friends, all of whom have been perfectly polite and friendly - they\u2019re all lovely people. But when they get together as a group oh my GOD I could not converse. They had known each other for so long and were so close the inside jokes were rampant, sentences didn\u2019t even need to be finished for everyone to erupt into laughter (\u201chey guys remember when Pete did the-\u201c \u201cOMG YES HAHAHA that was so funny\u201d), every other story was about their shared time together. Now this totally wasn\u2019t intentional of them but I had absolutely no way of joining in, and I did feel like an outsider! I brought it up to my boyfriend and thankfully he took me seriously, listened, watched and saw it happening. He made an effort to bring the conversation back to me, but it rarely worked - so we made a deal. He would pick the events that were most important to him (which, by the way, 100% includes group trips) and I would go along - aside from that I would do my own thing, with my friends, where I could actually contribute more than one word to the conversation.\n\nNow I don\u2019t know your group\u2019s dynamic from the post, i don\u2019t have all the facts, it just struck a chord with me because it\u2019s very similar to how my boyfriend saw it initially before listening to my perspective.\n\nYour wife should be more communicative with you on why she felt like an outsider, you should absolutely have not thought about the trip if she was not invited\n\nEDIT: totally forgot - your friends also suck for not inviting her, saying she had a crap attitude when it sounds like she hasn\u2019t been rude to them at all. Very cliquey mean behaviour, not really acceptable in adulthood", "I feel like this phrasing is really telling: \n\n\"my wife ... would sometimes skip group events to hang with her college friends if she had something else planned.\"\n\nSo, you're describing nights when you hung out with your college friends, and she hung out with hers. But you're describing it as her \"skipping\" your event to do her own thing. Weren't you just as much \"skipping\" her group event to hang out with your friends? \n\nThe whole vibe from your post is that you are centering your college friend group, not your marriage. That friend group is your primary relationship, and it'd be great if your wife could fit in better, but she doesn't, and so you continue to primarily hang out and vacation with your friends, and your wife either joins or \"skips\". Where is your marriage in this? When do you hang with her friend group from college, and how well do you fit in with them? Or does it not matter to you whether you fit in with them? Why do you get to continue with your close-knit friend group you have history with, while the only acceptable social circle for your wife is to join yours? \n\nAlso, not inviting someone because you assume they won't want to go is BS. If that's the only issue, invite them, they can decide for themselves if they want to go. That's not why they aren't inviting her and you know it, you even said it. It's one thing to go on a separate vacation from your spouse, for a hobby you don't share or girls/guys trip. But this is a group of married couples, and you're considering being the only one there without your spouse. If this friend group is so important to you, bring your wife on the trip and see it as another opportunity for them to bond. Or, vacation with your wife and let your friends go without you if they're not interested in inviting both of you. You're a couple, you should be a package deal on a couple's trip. \n\nLook, maybe your wife is really being a real pill to your friends and making zero effort. But on the other hand, maybe you're underestimating how uncomfortable it can feel to be the only one in the room not a part of a close-knit group, with tons of inside jokes, shared history, and bonding that you can just never fully catch up to. Have you really tried facilitating bonds between your wife and some of your friends? Created opportunities for her to hang out with them in smaller groups, one-on-one, or without you there? 1:1 interactions are easier to find common ground with someone, 7:1 you're just going to get lost and forgotten as everyone else gravitates toward those they already know well and feel comfortable with, even if they politely ask you questions now and then to make an effort. \n\nIf you value your marriage, you're going to need to do some reflection here, and definitely don't go on that trip and leave her behind and uninvited. \n\nYTA, but you don't have to continue to be.", "ESH. Your wife, because your friends have tried repeatedly to include her and she has thrown it  back in their faces.

What have they done to make her feel included?\n\nYour wife \u201cskips\u201d group events if she already has something planned??  That\u2019s not skipping out on anything; that\u2019s just her being unable to attend because she has other plans.  Also, her occasionally not going to group events because she doesn\u2019t want to is completely normal.  It\u2019s not like she refuses to hangout with your friends.\n\nIdk if there\u2019s some missing context, but it sounds like your wife has been telling you for years that she\u2019s uncomfortable around your friends and feels like she\u2019s an outsider, but she still hangs out with them and is nothing but nice/cordial around them.  Nothing you\u2019ve mentioned warrants her specifically being told she\u2019s not allowed to come on a couples/group vacation.

Your wife's attitude is shitty but you are shittier in this case by telling her her feelings are invalid basically.", "Info: Are you planning on going on the trip without your wife, since they aren't changing their minds on not inviting her?", "Why would you WANT to hang out with people who willingly exclude your wife?

Your approach is quite telling that you both need to work on communication. \nYou first started off saying to your wife that it's not anything she did to not be invited which feeds into her thought process of being the outsider. Than she vents about it than you contradict that statement and tell her if she wasn't so hostile towards your friends than things might be different. You didn't have to be more diplomatic but you should have been more direct on what you mean otherwise it is confusing. \n\nYou statement about it not being anything she did was a white lie so you could soften the blow. Why? That is the question? Seems to me it was so you thought she would agree and move on so you could go on the trip with no guilt.\n\nYou wife is civil towards you friends but she is not one of the friends. She probably is uncomfortable around them and they pick up on it. Everybody probably wouldn't have have fun in a group vacation till she and them get over the awkwardness and just be.

I see it as hoping to wreck the marriage.", "Fully agree. \n\n1) The wife is the TA for two reasons. 1) Not trying to know the friend group better. It's been 10 years, at this point in marriage, your friends become hers and hers become yours. 2) I think she is being too hard and immature about the way she is communicating. There is so much to unpack and this needs to be done by talking. I find behaviors like this annoying. Although, it looks like this whole ordeal hurt her more than it seems.\n\n2) If it is a couples trip, you always always invite the partner. You get along or not. If your wife has declined these many years, she would have declined this one too. It almost seems like ganging up against her. And they are inviting you. Unless, they have planned to get rid of you too, this is not a good move. \n\n3) Why did your wife's upsetting make you feel she deserved it? You are a unit. They not inviting her  equals they not inviting you or respecting your choice of partner. While I can see why you said what you said, your friends are not saints. They are in the wrong here to exclude her. Also, dude, get some new friends outside of college. They aren't growing up and they aren't letting you grow up.", "Um, because it is mostly her fault.

And also the fact that he skimmed right over the rather pointed insult about his spouse to focus on the fact that it's okay for her to be snubbed because she wouldn't want to be there.\n\nI've also seen variations of this basic argument from both sides IRL in friend groups in integrating someone's significant other, and it can certainly be awkward from both sides, even if everyone is well-meaning and making an effort. Hell, I'm kind of a socially awkward person who often ducks out of social events myself, even without the added complication of a significant other, but people in my social circles still do me the courtesy of inviting me and letting me know I'll be welcome if I feel up to being there, and it is something that I sincerely appreciate, even if I ultimately just can't bring myself to attend.\n\nBut the friends here escalated this drastically by not giving her a courtesy invite (regardless of their own thoughts on her) and making it very clear she was absolutely not welcome. It makes me think there's some substantial information missing from this post.

You said it was nothing she did, but you say they told you \"Even if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don\u2019t want it to ruin the vacation\". Well if that is how they feel fine. You can still be friends with them. But you should have back the hell up from their vacation. You could have got onto the group chat and make it clear, but your being a coward instead of standing up for your wife. \n\nYOU go, your marriage is done and you would deserve it. But what you should do, is get on the group chat and say you will not be attending. Make it clear that your wife may have added to issues, but she clearly did not feel as apart of the group to be more involved. You nor them can decide what would be enough for her to be ok with how things are. And you and them do not need to have to have your wife around to be friends. But you can not and will not be making group functions if there is a need by them to not include your wife. \n\nYour words again, might be correct. She making her own self proclaimed prophecy on being a outsider true. BUT it is clear she felt that way before your friends made it a fact to you. So maybe, there is more to it for your wife, and you should be a good husband and stand by her, stand up for her, but make sure there is a clear understanding your friends do not have to be her friends, and her friends do not have to be yours. But a group event where it will be couples attending will not be made and done if either SO is not wanted, not invited, or miss treated.\n\nGo buy your wife flowers, and go to her.

One example, you guys have no idea how many inside jokes you have and if you never took the time to explain them, she's the outsider. Been there. I managed to break in in the past but it's easy to feel alone in the group. \n\nAlso, it doesn't matter if she's inside or outside. You do not NOT ask half of a couple on a couple's trip.

That is supremely unrealistic for a tight knit group that were already adults when they formed. \n\nIt sounds like your wife has felt pushed aside by your friend group and unsupported by you for a long time\n\nIf your friends are as great as you say, your wife should have a standing invite. End of. If she turns it down then that's her perogative. If she says you can go without her that's fine.

What really makes him TA in my eyes though, is the fact that he's not even attempting to see it from her point of view. He just expects his wife to instantly befriend people she is uncomfortable around. I do however agree with the friend's decision to not invite her, I wouldn't either- not because she is an AH but because I know when to take a hint. YTA", "Be prepared to be downvoted by the hive mind.", "i mean yes but i\u2019m sure they\u2019d rather invite them both but it\u2019s the wife\u2019s fault she\u2019s not invited", "...and you seem to be missing the entire rest of the post.", "Yeah, I couldn't say it better, so I just quoted from kimono54", "The fact that you think its okay for* only 1/2 of a couple was invited speaks volumes about your character. Had this been a family dynamic, everyone would say OP is the AH for not defending and supporting his wife. You invite both people or you invite neither.", "How did she ruin anything. She\u2019s introverted, has been polite and has attempted to attend. What did she ruin?", "That is true but if they are all old friends when they meet up it is pretty common place for most conversations to revolve around the past, wouldn\u2019t you agree? While they can make new memories if the friend group is so hung up on reminiscing about the old times there is no room for the wife to be included in new times and on top of of that when they are going to make new memories such as the vacation they planned OPs wife could be included and then they could all share new memories", "> The rest of them have spouses too - seems like they are able to integrate fine.\n\nMy understanding is the other 6 are all couples who met in college and got married to each other. His 3 male friends married his 3 female friends.", "He can go. He's more than welcome to go. If they want separate vacations then more power to them. You still ask both.", "It's the fact that they specifically said that she *couldn't* go, even if she wanted to. Married couples have separate friend groups all the time & they don't always mesh with the opposite groups. But it's one thing to not go because you don't mesh, it's completely different than being deliberately excluded because you don't mesh.", "It honestly makes you feel like the third wheel. And if nobody ever tries to explain any of it....it's extremely uncomfortable. You can't join in on the conversation if you have no idea what the hell they're talking about, but you don't want to interrupt the flow, so you just sit there watching, and then are accused of being anti social.", "He also blames her for choosing to hang out with her college friends instead of his\u2026", "OP said she was \"cordial but uncomfortable\". It's *his* job to make her comfortable amongst his close friends not hers to solve that puzzle of where the disconnect is alone.", "Because everyone in this toxic group thinks they\u2019re better than everyone else, including OP. Why wouldn\u2019t anyone else consider themselves touched by the gods for being allowed to bask in the presence of these 7 glorious undergrads?", "Yes I agree. For me the fact that its called a friends vacation but in reality is a couples vacation is the dealbreaker.  If it was just a close group of friends, it wouldn't seem as odd. But to purposefully exclude a spouse from a couples vacation? That's not acceptable.", "Same, the *only* time I would ever be deliberately excluded would be a boy's trip. And he'd never be able to stand one of those. And I'm not friends with his friends, just friendly, if that makes sense.", "Because while you may not get along with them they are decent people. The same cannot be said for OP\u2019s friends.", "To me that is the most damning. That they decided on excluding her while also excluding him from that discussion. Makes me think they weren\u2019t as inviting to his wife as OP thinks. I\u2019ve had friends with partners I did not jive with at all, some I even outright disliked. I would still never exclude them in this fashion.", "Maybe that\u2019s a comment I missed? I don\u2019t know if we can just assume that no one ever tried to include or talk directly to her. Sometimes people try and it just doesn\u2019t work out. But regardless OP and his friends are all massive AHs for not inviting her. \n\nGiving them the benefit of the doubt it\u2019s possible they did try but none of them ever really meshed well with each other so they just never got close to her and don\u2019t really like her. That\u2019s fine honestly, not everyone needs to like each other, I don\u2019t like some of my boyfriends friends. The difference is that I recognize my boyfriend does and they\u2019re still part of the friend group so I would never exclude them or act rudely to them. I don\u2019t think the friends are AH for not liking OP\u2019s wife but it\u2019s terrible to actively not invite her when everyone else is going as a couple.", "why should he get excluded because his wife can suck it up amd be friendly? doesn\u2019t make an effort at all. they aren\u2019t rude, it seems like she is. it sounds like she acts snobby around them, like somehow she\u2019s better than them. she has no interest in being around them, so why is she even upset that she wasn\u2019t invited? i doubt she would\u2019ve even have wanted to go. she\u2019s just doing this because she thinks they\u2019re \u201cawful people\u201d just because they\u2019re no her cup of tea? yeah fuck that.", "I mean, I'd have said something like thanks for being honest or letting me know. Better than everyone lying. Basically what's happening is the wife is making OP choose between her and his friends. And it's because she refused to try getting along with them from what we can tell. I might be jaded, but I've seen abusers who use this ruse to isolate their victims.\n\n\"Your friends don't like me. You have to choose between your friends and me, and if you choose them you're a bad husband!\"\n\nIt can often start small and work up over years, if it were immediate and obvious nobody would fall for it. My abusive relationship he kept \"forgetting\" to bring home food to control my weight. Then he loaned out his car to a friend so we only had one and I couldn't buy my own, she needed it to get to work and support her son. My friends and family knew something was up but not what, so didn't like him and that caused isolation so he was able to do it more. But it started with one meal a week after we'd been together for months. Then it slowly worked up. Eventually I was actually ill. But everyone kept telling me I looked great because they didn't see when I took my shirt off my ribs were sticking out. And I still just thought it was him being stressed and forgetful, until I happened to end up needing to visit my grandparents. Once I was away from him for a bit my head began to clear and I realized what had happened.", "I guess part of this depends on whether you see it as a couples vacation. They are a group of friends in their own right, most of whom happen to be couples. If one of those couples were not in a relationship with each other, the implication to me is that they'd still be invited. It's got nothing to do with being in a couple so OP's wife isn't invited just for being his wife - just as no one else is invited just because of their romantic relationship.", "It's a group vacation, not a couple's vacation.", "no, he said she skips events to hang with her friends. she never made an effort with his friends. he\u2019s not abusive. he\u2019s not alienating her. she\u2019s alienating herself.", "i\u2019m prepared. i stand by what i said. he\u2019s not alienating her. she\u2019s alienating herself.", "I wondered this too", "I agree they will reminisce. That\u2019s pretty common, but if he is a good husband, he can say, hey, my wife and I did this, and include her in the conversation. She can find things in common with new people. I do this all the time when I meet new people", "With preexisting plans even! She had other plans *first* and he says she's \"skipping\" things. Sticking with commitments is literally the opposite", "Info lol, does he make an effort to be friends with her friends or is his friends more important because he values himself more?", "That's what got my spidey senses going. The way he said that she'd cancel on them, but it wasn't cancelling because she already had plans before that. So I don't think he puts as much importance on her & her friends.", "Sometimes people don\u2019t gel. And no, it is a nice thing to do and it does appear that he tried but if she\u2019s resistant to it then that is on HER.", "We have friends vacations, with BFFS attending without their spouses/partners. But this is just understood by both parties, and there are no hurt feelings.  Definitely never outright excluding anyone. That'd be bizarre - and it would seem to be disrespecting their marriage.", "What are you talking about? You're projecting on a lot of this. As far as we know OPs wife has been nothing but civil so the \"attitude\" talk is weird. \n\nBottom line any group that invites you but not your partner for an entire week is being an AH when everyone is coupled up.", "Thats terrible. I'm so sorry you went through all of that. I hope things are better now.", "There is no evidence in the slightest she is attempting to isolate. If she goes out with her own people while he is out, that\u2019s a good sign she isn\u2019t attempting that simply selecting to not go somewhere where she feels unwanted is not attempting to isolate. Esp since she doesn\u2019t appear to attempt to stop him", "We have no evidence that ops wife is trying to isolate him. She even went out with her own friends so we know she\u2019s not like trying to make him miss stuff for her.  An abuser can also say \u201cyou did this to yourself\u201d so I don\u2019t think anyone should be jumping to that conclusion with the information provided. \n\nThat being said I\u2019m so sorry you went through that and I\u2019m glad you got out I truly am.", "Yeah, that's what OP calls it. But all the other friends are couples except for OP. So in my mind that becomes a couples vacation.", "Except everyone else is bringing their spouse. This is so freaking rude.", "I agree her husband definitely needed to step up to help bridge the gap. When my partner moved across the globe to live with me I made sure I helped him feel comfortable with my friends and if he ever shared with me after that he had a hard time I would make a point to help the next time so OPs husband needs to work on that. She most definitely an unfortunately I don\u2019t feel like OP is giving as much insight to the hang outs as he can and he may even be blinded because of the rose colored lenses you can give old friends. I\u2019ve definitely done it and it wasn\u2019t till someone pointed it out that I noticed. I think both OP and his wife need to work on their social skills.", "She hasn't been resistant, she's been cordial but has said it's hard to break into a group that are already established and so close knit. Her husband should be bridging that gap with his friends, not her as the outsider (who's already trying and is already cordial to no avail).\n\nThese are people close to and in her husband's life, it's not a case of, 'oh well, we don't gel, let's go our separate ways'- they'll be part of his life for a long time so she needs to have a working relationship with them. Them doing this was unnecessarily hostile and he shouldn't have agreed to go without her being invited as well.", "I think you're wrong. It's not on completely on her. She tried, the friends tried (i guess?), doesn't sound like he tried. And them just not meshing isn't a reason to deliberately say that *his wife* wasn't welcome. But it seems he also puts more importance on his friends than hers, just by the way he worded some things. So I really don't think it's her. I think she's felt like the third wheel with them for years, and there wasn't any actual effort (which was OP's job), to include her. \n\nu/kimono54 said it best (I added the spacing):\n\n>When 7 people have been friends for many years, they have inside jokes and stories. I feel like even though your friends may have been nice and polite to her, the 7 of you likely get together and talk about the good old days and drink and say to each other \"remember when so and so did this? Yeah that's when they were dating what's his face! I was working at this restaurant at that time. You remember we would all go and get pizza after this class? What was the name of that place? Etc\"\n\n>Your wife had to sit there and listen silently. It's like traveling to a place where you don't know the language but all of your friends do. She could have interrupted the conversation and asked for an explanation and timeline of events so she could follow the conversation but it would have interfered with the flow of conversation and bonding. She chose to sip her drink quietly, metaphorically speaking. I think it was your job to teach her the language and make sure she felt included. The fact that she still doesn't feel comfortable with them after you've been together this long means you didn't do your job.", "Most definitely. Deliberately saying that she wasn't welcome is absolutely horrible. Only thing that's worse is OP not standing up for her or taking her side by declining to go.", "Thank you it was forever ago it feels like and another life in a way. I just had a 12th anniversary with the love of my life.\n\nBut as for OP, the wife refused to try fitting in with his friends whose spouses all managed, to the point that they talk about a \"bad attitude,\" and is now refusing to speak to him for saying that they don't think she'd enjoy a vacation with them. Refusing to speak is known to be a sign of abuse now. \"I won't talk to you until you give me what I want.\" That's not ok. It makes me wonder what else might be going on that even OP doesn't realize.", "If anything it seems more like he\u2019s trying to isolate her. If they\u2019re friends from before I\u2019m sure they talk about stories she wasn\u2019t there for constantly and past memories bonding. I\u2019m sure we are guilty on reminiscing in front of people who can\u2019t join and maybe that\u2019s why she feels left out and awkward. Seems like she tries to talk to OP about her uncomfortable feelings and he just scoffs and even the idea instead of hearing her out. Also how dare she have plans with her friends when he makes plans with his. She\u2019s only allowed to go out when he does with his friends doesn\u2019t she know??/s \nIf anything OP seems like the red flag.", "\"I won't talk to you or answer your calls/texts because you upset me\" is also a sign of abuse. From what OP said, she was told she wasn't invited because nobody thought she'd have fun and she became angry and left, totally ignoring him.", "And OP thanking his friend for \"his honesty\" after he told OP that wife wasn't invited.", "Seriously! That's just not right. He obviously puts more importance on his friends rather than his wife."]}
