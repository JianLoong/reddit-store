{"id": 2089, "submission_id": "ysxsgm", "title": "AITA for telling my wife it's her own fault for not getting invited on a group trip?", "selftext": "Me (32M) and my wife (31F) have been together for about 6 years. We get along wonderfully and through everything, have never had any major fights except for one thing.\n\nI personally feel like my wife makes no effort to get along with my friends.\n\nNow to give context, all my friends and I went to the same university for undergrad (3 guys and 3 girls that are married). My wife is the only one that did not have this common trait of attending undergrad between the 8 of us, which is really not a big deal if you ask me.\n\nEarly on in our relationship, my friends would always try and be friendly to her and talk to her when we would mutually hang out. My wife was cordial, but you could tell that she was uncomfortable. I would speak with her about this, and she would always comment that she was an \u201coutsider\u201d to all of us.\n\nThis always personally made me slightly miffed because I felt that my friends always made an effort to include her and make sure that she wasn\u2019t singled out.\n\nThroughout the years, my wife would attend events with me but would seem distant and would sometimes skip group events to hang with her college friends if she had something else planned. My friends never said anything but were always nice and treated her kindly.\n\nWell this week I got a group text from my friends about planning a group vacation to somewhere next year. I quickly noticed my wife wasn\u2019t on the group text and asked about it. I got a call from one of my friends who basically said that they didn\u2019t invite my wife because:\n\n1.\tBased on all the previous interactions they didn\u2019t think she would want to attend \n2.\tEven if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don\u2019t want it to ruin the vacation \n\nI thanked my friend for his honesty and told him I\u2019d think about it. And while I love my wife, I figured she more than likely wouldn\u2019t want to go on a vacation with them.\n\nSo I told my wife about the trip, and she asked about details. I told her that while I was invited, she wasn\u2019t, and it wasn\u2019t because of anything she did, but because they thought she wouldn\u2019t want to attend.\n\nWell this statement just seemed to about how she is an outsider. She said that because of the history us 7 had together, she had no chance of ever being a part of the group. She then went on a rant about how my friends are awful people and that she deserved to be invited even if she didn\u2019t want to be there because she is my wife.\n\nI sat there and listened to her vent and then finally I calmly told her that it was pretty much her own fault for not being invited, because she had taken such a hostile stance with them from the get go. She became a self fulfilling prophecy about being an outsider. That\u2019s paraphrasing but something along those lines. \n\nShe left the house and went to her mothers.\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to her in several days despite texts and phone calls to try and talk to her. I probably should have been more diplomatic about what I said, but I do feel my friends have been treated unfairly.

That's AH territory.\n\nThen you went and blamed your wife for their behaviour.\n\nWhat I would have done was assumed that your wife was probably right on the way she's claimed she's been treated.\n\nAlso it is really hard to break into a close knit friend group, you say they made an effort but based on this post it sounds like they might have made a very superficial attempt to be polite and your wife picked up on that.", "Why would you even want to go on a couples vacation, alone, with 3 other couples?

Your friends are actively excluding her and you're okay with it. I wonder how many times they did this in front of you where you just ignored it or made excuses for their behavior. Your friends don't seem like very good people. Why don't you make it fair and suggest they leave their wives at home.", "YTA for being willing to exclude your wife.\n\nYour friends don't make your decisions, you do. It sounds like there's more going on between your wife and friends then you're mentioning, or maybe more than you care to notice or take seriously which makes sense, since you don't seem to think them excluding her is serious. I bet she's brought up legitimate issues about them with you before. \n\nAlso, you've mentioned hanging out with her friends in the comments but I've only seen you mention the golfing with one couple, that's it. You have a friend group that's much larger and I bet the college buddies or college stories come up a lot when you hang out. Maybe compare the conversation her friends make with you vs. the conversation your friends make with her and see if there's a difference.", "YTA. This is your wife. She absolutely has been an outsider since day 1. You had 4 years of life and inside jokes with these people before her and it was your responsibility to help her fit in. You said your friends were nice to her, but there\u2019s inclusion and there\u2019s pity nice, how\u2019s the weather type of nice. I felt the same as your wife in my past relationship. Felt like he had a second life I was excluded from. He blamed me for not fitting in too but he did nothing to help. Just left me with the other females of the group. I\u2019m so glad that relationship ended. If you want to keep your wife you need to make drastic changes.", "Your friends who are three couples invited you on a trip and specifically excluded your wife? That\u2019s rude to both you and her, and YTA for then blaming your wife who indeed is treated as an outsider. You say she\u2019s always polite to them and sometimes has other plans, which is totally normal. I don\u2019t know why you aren\u2019t angry on your own behalf much less why you blame her for your insular friends not welcoming your wife even if just for you.", ">Even if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don't want it to ruin the vacation\n\nWhat the hell are you doing allowing your friends to get away with saying something like this about your partner?\n\nYou should have said no to the trip the second you found out they excluded your wife and taken your shitty friends to task for saying something so degrading about her.\n\nEven if my SO hated someone in my life, if a group of them all got together and deliberately excluded them but included me in a holiday then told me it's because they have a crappy attitude and ruined everyone's mood, I'd just defend them and refuse to go because this is all just horribly cruel, immature, and unfair.\n\nYour wife is right to be hurt and upset by these events. You're husband and wife, you're supposed to look out for one another, whether your partner's in the room or not, especially when they're not. So, why are prioritising your friend group and their exclusionary holiday over your spouse? And then you told her it was her fault as well. Smh.", "Sort of want to go with ESH, but you haven\u2019t explained how your wife has acted towards them, is she outwardly hostile to them or is she polite? If she\u2019s nice to them YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a hard one, I think it\u2019s strange to be ok with your friends not inviting your wife on a holiday and and not standing up for your wife is a dick move. It would be incredibly intimidating being the new person in a group of friends who have all known each other for many years and are married to each other, to say it\u2019s not a big deal is ridiculous! \nThat being said if she gave up on trying to be friends with your friends that is a bad move on her part considering they sound very important to you, if she\u2019s just accepted that she and them will only be friendly instead of friends that\u2019s kind of normal? Not everyone becomes best friends with their partners friends. You need to sort it out regardless because outright confirming to her that they don\u2019t like her is going to cause a bigger rift between them now. Honestly your friends need to grow up because that\u2019s your wife, you\u2019re a package deal, they can\u2019t just exclude her all the time. Unfortunately with you telling her this I don\u2019t see how she will get past it.", "YTA - so she was right all along. She is an outsider, they do exclude her and you are an active participant in this. \n\nDon\u2019t you dare go on this trip without your wife. That would be an absolute shitty thing to do to her.", "ESH. Your wife either dislikes your friends or is intimidated by your tight-knit-ness and that made her defensive from the get-go, but either way, she has not made any efforts to stop being an outsider. \n\nI know her position quite well, as my husband is very close with his group of friends from college, several of them also went to law school together and they have their own lawyer buddy sub-group. I was an outsider when I met them a little under ten years ago, but now, some of them I consider them friends myself, and I have a cordial although maybe not so close relationship with the rest (with exceptions, as my post history gives away hah). That didn't happen overnight, but they mostly made efforts to get to know me and include me, and I made the same effort to get to know them and integrate. Your wife didn't. She might have her reasons and she's not obligated to be friends with your friends, but she can't blame the distance solely on them. \n\nThat said, your friends absolutely crossed a line by inviting you and not your wife to a couples trip. That's beyond rude and classless of them. And you should've shut that down the moment you were told! Regardless of whether she'd like to go, she is your wife and it's completely inappropriate they exclude her. If anything they should've excluded you both and told you that they were sorry but since they didn't want her to come, neither of you was invited. It'd still be AH behavior but it wouldn't be as crass as inviting a man and not his wife to a trip with all married couples. \n\nFinally, your wife tried to express her feelings to you. It was an opportunity for communication and for maybe trying to see where the root of this distance between her and the friend group comes from. Instead, you used her vulnerability against her, told her it's all her fault, and quite literally took your friends' side over hers, when she is the one being excluded. \n\nEveryone is an AH here, but you need to rethink your priorities because you're putting your marriage second to your friendships.", "YTA - you \u201cfelt they made an effort\u201d and thought \u201cthey were always polite\u201d but obviously she\u2019s never felt included in the group, and you are still so caught up in how you perceive things and trying to decide how she should\u2019ve felt about it.", "YTA, and you should be doing some serious reflection on how you\u2019re treating your wife and her emotions. \n\nYou paint yourself as the picture of rationality here, but the story instead speaks to someone who simply doesn\u2019t care to understand the complexity of their partner feeling othered. \n\nINFO: What have you done to make your wife more comfortable with your friends? What have you asked of them? What have you changed, yourself? \n\nI\u2019m sorry her discomfort and attempts to compromise have caused you such grief. And I hope she respects herself enough to stop compromising, as she seems to be the only one making an attempt.", "YTA, it doesn't matter how your wife has behaved in the past to your friends, them not inviting YOUR WIFE on the trip is wrong, you 2 are a pair. You shouldn't have even entertained the idea after they excluded YOUR WIFE.", "NTA\n\nMaking friends is hard and requires effort... For 6 years your partner did not put any effort in.\n\nReap wat you saw.... And she didn't saw anything!\n\nPs. My partner has a bit the same, so i feel your struggle. Although in my case all partners are \"new friends\". And everybody gets along except my partner is \"always tired\". \n\nYour friends are right... If your partner *would* come along then it would be for the location and not for the friendship. And I bet it's the other way around for y'all. At least your partner should be honest and admit it's not about the people....\n\nNTA...

Honestly, your friends made the effort dozens of times it seems, every single time your wife would be there, from what it sounds like, they did make the most effort they could to talk to her.\n\nBut you can't talk to someone who isn't willing to, otherwise it's like pulling teeth and conversation seems forced into shallow subjects of \"how's the weather / hows the job\", etc. If you constantly make yourself an outsider in situations, you are going to be an outsider. \n\nThat being said, she *is* your wife and your friends know you two should be a package deal. Even if they don't like it, it's still a courtesy to extend the invitation towards your wife as well. \n\nESH and OP, I think in the future, or even now, you are probably facing a harsh reality and decision that will more than likely come down to your friends or your wife.", "YTA- it maybe that your wife is not comfortable because she doesn\u2019t have anything in common besides you with these friends? She doesn\u2019t get the inside jokes or references since she didn\u2019t go to the same school as you all? It could be completely innocent but still make her feel like not a part of the group. She should have been invited, but if she was not you should have said something since she is your wife.", "I'm going with NTA\n\nNot sure why there's so many YTA judgements but your wife literally had 6 years to be friendly with your friends. Yea, it hurts that she wasn't invited but when she's had 6 years to be friendly and hangout to get to know your friend group, there's no reason for her to be mad that she wasn't invited when she didn't make the effort other than \"being cordial\".", "YTA this is a vacation.

I have been in a similar position and it\u2019s frustrating when you feel like your SO isn\u2019t making an effort but you\u2019re not listening to her and you\u2019re just dismissing what she\u2019s saying. It is hard to fit in with a group that\u2019s known each other for a long time. Sometimes people are making an effort but they still can\u2019t force themselves to feel comfortable and that can be difficult to hide. It doesn\u2019t mean anything bad about your wife or your friends, it is what it is.\n\nThat said, I went into this story thinking there might be extenuating circumstances that make you not the asshole but there are none. Your friends are major assholes for putting you in this situation and it\u2019s them you should be mad at. You\u2019re an asshole for even considering this when it was explained to you.", "YTA You and your friends should have let her decide whether or not she wanted to go, not decide for her. Also, you should always be on her side. If she's not invited, you shouldn't go either.\n\nETA: If it's really true that you get along wonderfully except for this one issue, then maybe the two of you simply don't have a lot of experience with negotiating conflict. Maybe you should see a counselor together to work through this one issue.", "Major YTA. Just know if you go on this trip without your wife, that will lead to the path of your divorce.", "ESH you may have felt your friends were welcoming however she may not have felt the same as evidenced by her stating she felt like an outsider. Were you always with your wife at these gatherings or did you leave her to talk with them. Unless you were with her all the time you have no idea what was said or done when you weren\u2019t together. It is entirely possible they made her feel like an outsider. She should have been more direct in why she felt like an outsider however you should have asked as well. I know from experience that people can be friendly when their friends are around and then turn on the newcomer when they are alone. If you go on this couples trip without your wife you WBTA. The fact that your friends felt they could exclude her and that you seem ok with it tells me there is something being left out of the narrative either you\u2019re friends or yours", "YTA and so are your friends.  Not everyone has to be friends, but the fact that your wife is the only person excluded on a couples vacation proves that they are being exclusive.   Why do even want to go on a couples trip as the single guy?  Why do you think it\u2019s okay for your friends to basically insult YOUR WIFE to your face?  Your friends basically told a husband that his wife sucks, but hey, that\u2019s totally okay.  Would you be okay if your wife\u2018s friends said you suck, and she then thanked them for telling her that?  Plus, if your wife is always cordial, why is her attitude crappy and hostile?  Are you all in high school?  Does your wife need to be the life of the party, attend every event or act a certain way in order to be invited to a group function?  Because if she does, your friends sound more like a teenage clique than anything else.

Why choose your friend over her, and expect that she should ditch her friends for yours when it doesn't look like you would even ditch your friends for her?

It is not your fault you have old friends from before you met her and that you have history with them she can't share. That's life. Life is imperfect. She could have chosen to make a new chapter of history with them with you and her included; instead, she was a deliberate wet blanket and alienated herself further because she couldn't immediately participate in all of the group dynamics in exactly the same way, due to her being the most recent member.", ">She then went on a rant about how my friends are awful people and that she deserved to be invited even if she didn\u2019t want to be there because she is my wife.\n\nNTA jeez, they aren't entitled to invite her nor does she \"deserve\" it, knowing likely she won't come and if she does, she'll act crappy like she has in the past.

We get along wonderfully and through everything, have never had any major fights except for one thing.\n\nI personally feel like my wife makes no effort to get along with my friends.\n\nNow to give context, all my friends and I went to the same university for undergrad (3 guys and 3 girls that are married). My wife is the only one that did not have this common trait of attending undergrad between the 8 of us, which is really not a big deal if you ask me.\n\nEarly on in our relationship, my friends would always try and be friendly to her and talk to her when we would mutually hang out. My wife was cordial, but you could tell that she was uncomfortable. I would speak with her about this, and she would always comment that she was an \u201coutsider\u201d to all of us.\n\nThis always personally made me slightly miffed because I felt that my friends always made an effort to include her and make sure that she wasn\u2019t singled out.\n\nThroughout the years, my wife would attend events with me but would seem distant and would sometimes skip group events to hang with her college friends if she had something else planned. My friends never said anything but were always nice and treated her kindly.\n\nWell this week I got a group text from my friends about planning a group vacation to somewhere next year. I quickly noticed my wife wasn\u2019t on the group text and asked about it. I got a call from one of my friends who basically said that they didn\u2019t invite my wife because:\n\n1.\tBased on all the previous interactions they didn\u2019t think she would want to attend \n2.\tEven if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don\u2019t want it to ruin the vacation \n\nI thanked my friend for his honesty and told him I\u2019d think about it. And while I love my wife, I figured she more than likely wouldn\u2019t want to go on a vacation with them.\n\nSo I told my wife about the trip, and she asked about details. I told her that while I was invited, she wasn\u2019t, and it wasn\u2019t because of anything she did, but because they thought she wouldn\u2019t want to attend.\n\nWell this statement just seemed to about how she is an outsider. She said that because of the history us 7 had together, she had no chance of ever being a part of the group. She then went on a rant about how my friends are awful people and that she deserved to be invited even if she didn\u2019t want to be there because she is my wife.\n\nI sat there and listened to her vent and then finally I calmly told her that it was pretty much her own fault for not being invited, because she had taken such a hostile stance with them from the get go. She became a self fulfilling prophecy about being an outsider. That\u2019s paraphrasing but something along those lines. \n\nShe left the house and went to her mothers.\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to her in several days despite texts and phone calls to try and talk to her. I probably should have been more diplomatic about what I said, but I do feel my friends have been treated unfairly. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "INFO: OP I think we're missing some important information. Is there a reason why your wife doesn't get along with your friends? Are there significant personality differences? Is your wife an introvert or something? And perhaps are your friends much more extroverted? Do you think there's a chance that there's a chance that friends aren't as nice and welcoming as you say they are? Or does your wife think they do or say things that she finds objectionable? Does your wife simply have less friends or her friends aren't as close, so she feels a bit jealous and/or lonely? \n\nI'm asking these questions trying to figure out why your wife feels excluded and even if she does why it bothers her so much when she wasn't invited to join the vacation (which based on what you've said would make her miserable anyway).", "YTA. \n\nLet\u2019s say you go\u2026is it worth having your wife always resent you for it? Is it worth your partner being gone right now and later fighting with in the days before/after the trip? \n\nThis will drive a wedge between you two if you go. As it is, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s already hurting and thinking that you\u2019ve chosen people who didn\u2019t even want to invite her. \n\nActually, them not inviting her is a quite telling. Also, they invited you knowing that this could create an issue in your marriage. Their comfort (or whatever) meant more to them than sparing their boy this trouble. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t roll out an invite to one of my friends knowing what it could lead to\u2014it\u2019s common sense. If I was this uncomfortable with a friend\u2019s partner, I wouldn\u2019t invite either of them and spare them this shitshow.  \n\nMaybe you two should divorce and you find someone single closer to your friends circle? **A little sarcasm** \n\nRespectfully, this is absurd. You\u2019re married. Be the partner your wife needs you to be and tell your friends that, while you apologize that your wife isn\u2019t close to them, that you will not be going and that you hope that they\u2019ll respect your decision. Once you\u2019ve done that, call your wife and tell her that you love her and that you two will plan your own mini getaway.", "I\u2019m going to go with a soft ESH, but was almost NAH.\n\nSo for full disclosure OP for a good 70% of your post I almost wondered if my other half had written this post - then I got to the end and saw you had gone along with her not being invited on the trip!! Eek!\n\nMy other half has an incredibly tight knit group of uni friends, all of whom have been perfectly polite and friendly - they\u2019re all lovely people. But when they get together as a group oh my GOD I could not converse. They had known each other for so long and were so close the inside jokes were rampant, sentences didn\u2019t even need to be finished for everyone to erupt into laughter (\u201chey guys remember when Pete did the-\u201c \u201cOMG YES HAHAHA that was so funny\u201d), every other story was about their shared time together. Now this totally wasn\u2019t intentional of them but I had absolutely no way of joining in, and I did feel like an outsider! I brought it up to my boyfriend and thankfully he took me seriously, listened, watched and saw it happening. He made an effort to bring the conversation back to me, but it rarely worked - so we made a deal. He would pick the events that were most important to him (which, by the way, 100% includes group trips) and I would go along - aside from that I would do my own thing, with my friends, where I could actually contribute more than one word to the conversation.\n\nNow I don\u2019t know your group\u2019s dynamic from the post, i don\u2019t have all the facts, it just struck a chord with me because it\u2019s very similar to how my boyfriend saw it initially before listening to my perspective.\n\nYour wife should be more communicative with you on why she felt like an outsider, you should absolutely have not thought about the trip if she was not invited\n\nEDIT: totally forgot - your friends also suck for not inviting her, saying she had a crap attitude when it sounds like she hasn\u2019t been rude to them at all. Very cliquey mean behaviour, not really acceptable in adulthood", "I feel like this phrasing is really telling: \n\n\"my wife ... would sometimes skip group events to hang with her college friends if she had something else planned.\"\n\nSo, you're describing nights when you hung out with your college friends, and she hung out with hers. But you're describing it as her \"skipping\" your event to do her own thing. Weren't you just as much \"skipping\" her group event to hang out with your friends? \n\nThe whole vibe from your post is that you are centering your college friend group, not your marriage. That friend group is your primary relationship, and it'd be great if your wife could fit in better, but she doesn't, and so you continue to primarily hang out and vacation with your friends, and your wife either joins or \"skips\". Where is your marriage in this? When do you hang with her friend group from college, and how well do you fit in with them? Or does it not matter to you whether you fit in with them? Why do you get to continue with your close-knit friend group you have history with, while the only acceptable social circle for your wife is to join yours? \n\nAlso, not inviting someone because you assume they won't want to go is BS. If that's the only issue, invite them, they can decide for themselves if they want to go. That's not why they aren't inviting her and you know it, you even said it. It's one thing to go on a separate vacation from your spouse, for a hobby you don't share or girls/guys trip. But this is a group of married couples, and you're considering being the only one there without your spouse. If this friend group is so important to you, bring your wife on the trip and see it as another opportunity for them to bond. Or, vacation with your wife and let your friends go without you if they're not interested in inviting both of you. You're a couple, you should be a package deal on a couple's trip. \n\nLook, maybe your wife is really being a real pill to your friends and making zero effort. But on the other hand, maybe you're underestimating how uncomfortable it can feel to be the only one in the room not a part of a close-knit group, with tons of inside jokes, shared history, and bonding that you can just never fully catch up to. Have you really tried facilitating bonds between your wife and some of your friends? Created opportunities for her to hang out with them in smaller groups, one-on-one, or without you there? 1:1 interactions are easier to find common ground with someone, 7:1 you're just going to get lost and forgotten as everyone else gravitates toward those they already know well and feel comfortable with, even if they politely ask you questions now and then to make an effort. \n\nIf you value your marriage, you're going to need to do some reflection here, and definitely don't go on that trip and leave her behind and uninvited. \n\nYTA, but you don't have to continue to be.", "ESH. Your wife, because your friends have tried repeatedly to include her and she has thrown it  back in their faces.

What have they done to make her feel included?\n\nYour wife \u201cskips\u201d group events if she already has something planned??  That\u2019s not skipping out on anything; that\u2019s just her being unable to attend because she has other plans.  Also, her occasionally not going to group events because she doesn\u2019t want to is completely normal.  It\u2019s not like she refuses to hangout with your friends.\n\nIdk if there\u2019s some missing context, but it sounds like your wife has been telling you for years that she\u2019s uncomfortable around your friends and feels like she\u2019s an outsider, but she still hangs out with them and is nothing but nice/cordial around them.  Nothing you\u2019ve mentioned warrants her specifically being told she\u2019s not allowed to come on a couples/group vacation.

Your wife's attitude is shitty but you are shittier in this case by telling her her feelings are invalid basically.", "Info: Are you planning on going on the trip without your wife, since they aren't changing their minds on not inviting her?", "Why would you WANT to hang out with people who willingly exclude your wife?

It's true you can't make your friends invite her but you can do a lot more for your wife and your marriage. Your approach is quite telling that you both need to work on communication. \nYou first started off saying to your wife that it's not anything she did to not be invited which feeds into her thought process of being the outsider. Than she vents about it than you contradict that statement and tell her if she wasn't so hostile towards your friends than things might be different. You didn't have to be more diplomatic but you should have been more direct on what you mean otherwise it is confusing. \n\nYou statement about it not being anything she did was a white lie so you could soften the blow. Why? That is the question? Seems to me it was so you thought she would agree and move on so you could go on the trip with no guilt.\n\nYou wife is civil towards you friends but she is not one of the friends. She probably is uncomfortable around them and they pick up on it. Everybody probably wouldn't have have fun in a group vacation till she and them get over the awkwardness and just be.

It's been 10 years, at this point in marriage, your friends become hers and hers become yours. 2) I think she is being too hard and immature about the way she is communicating. There is so much to unpack and this needs to be done by talking. I find behaviors like this annoying. Although, it looks like this whole ordeal hurt her more than it seems.\n\n2) If it is a couples trip, you always always invite the partner. You get along or not. If your wife has declined these many years, she would have declined this one too. It almost seems like ganging up against her. And they are inviting you. Unless, they have planned to get rid of you too, this is not a good move. \n\n3) Why did your wife's upsetting make you feel she deserved it? You are a unit. They not inviting her  equals they not inviting you or respecting your choice of partner. While I can see why you said what you said, your friends are not saints. They are in the wrong here to exclude her. Also, dude, get some new friends outside of college. They aren't growing up and they aren't letting you grow up.", "Um, because it is mostly her fault.

And also the fact that he skimmed right over the rather pointed insult about his spouse to focus on the fact that it's okay for her to be snubbed because she wouldn't want to be there.\n\nI've also seen variations of this basic argument from both sides IRL in friend groups in integrating someone's significant other, and it can certainly be awkward from both sides, even if everyone is well-meaning and making an effort. Hell, I'm kind of a socially awkward person who often ducks out of social events myself, even without the added complication of a significant other, but people in my social circles still do me the courtesy of inviting me and letting me know I'll be welcome if I feel up to being there, and it is something that I sincerely appreciate, even if I ultimately just can't bring myself to attend.\n\nBut the friends here escalated this drastically by not giving her a courtesy invite (regardless of their own thoughts on her) and making it very clear she was absolutely not welcome. It makes me think there's some substantial information missing from this post.

Lots of people have a friend whose spouse you don't click with but not inviting them to a couples trip is not acceptable.", ">but the reponse was that they were standing on not inviting her.\n\nThen you better not go. What a horrible thing do to the spouse of your \"friend\"", "OP - your friends \"standing on not inviting\" your wife says something about them. They don't seem to be respecting your marriage much by giving you basically an ultimatum - either you can come on vacation by yourself, or don't come at all.", "Yta. Are you still planning on going? If so that makes you a bigger AH. You might even be a single AH when you get back. It seems like your friends just tolerate her and she can tell. You are not helping the situation at all and doubling down on blaming her.", "Exactly!", "Do they all have separate spouses, or are they married to each other?", "Okay, then YWBTA if you went without your wife, sorry.", "You're the fucking asshole all the way", "Why in the world would you go on a trip where everyone else is paired up and you are all alone without your spouse??", "It maybe be nitpicking but the fact that you're saying that her friends were nice when yours were polite to her says a lot. If they were polite to her it feels like they endure her presence because of you but never really like her or open to her at the end of the day. \n\nI really hope it's just a bad choice of words from your part.", "Also you've mentioned a couple of times now that your wife won't come out with your friends when she has existing plans with her friends, like you think there's something wrong with that. There's not. She's not required to cancel plans with her friends to hang out with yours instead.", "So she has made a genuine effort despite how they treat her.", "Polite friends would not plan a trip and actively try to exclude your wife. How did they think that would make her feel? Did they not realize that it would cause a rift between you two?", "Being polite isn't the same thing as being welcoming, though. It's possible to be impeccably polite to someone while simultaneously making it clear that you don't want them around. \n\nYou said your friends invite her to things. How do they treat her once she's there? Do they try to engage her in conversation? Do they ask her about her life or try to talk about things she enjoys talking about? Or do they just swap in-jokes and tell college glory days stories and then get upset when your wife seems bored or doesn't have anything to contribute? Have they actually tried to get to know her and adapt your friendship to make room for her? Or did you all just sort of expect your wife to slide right into your existing group dynamic and then get annoyed when she didn't pretend to love being left out in the cold?\n\nI mean, it seems like she's making an effort to try to be part of the group. She keeps going out with you guys even though it doesn't seem like she enjoys your friends' company, probably because she loves you and wants you to be happy. Do they make an effort too?", "Has she voiced any specific concerns about your friends?", "Is there a reason why she would be insecure about fitting in with the group? Doesn't have to be rational, but it is there an ex girlfriend there? Is there a financial component? \nIn any case you're right about the self-fulfilling prophesy there... \nAfter more that 2-3 years honestly with just a little bit of effort your partner's friends can become your friends. You build new memories. \nI ask the questions above because I feel like your wife might not have made an effort because there's some deep rooted insecurity that made her assume it would always be down to that. You know what I mean?", "Your friends are 'polite' to your wife? It doesn't always translate as friendliness. You've chosen your friends over your wife and she knows this now. Congratulations.", "But he can\u2019t point to anything that shows she really excluded herself except that she expressed feeling left out. OP admits she regularly joins in and tries to be a part, but he also commented that she sometimes opts out because she already has plans. Why would she cancel her plans to see them? If they expect that level of attendance, that friend group is giving off cult vibes. She is allowed to not clock in every time they meet, and failure to do so is not excluding herself.\n\nNot inviting his wife to a couples trip is a gauntlet-throwing move. They are extremely rude.", "Maybe your friends just suck with outsiders. As people grow, so do their friend circles. You all in the same exact one. Maybe you all aren\u2019t as welcoming to outsiders as you think you are\u2026\n\nHave you ever thought about that?", "Maybe her friends are nicer than yours. Who invites someone to a group event and not their spouse?", "[removed]", "Your talk about breading things has made me hungry. Now I want to eat [tonkatsu](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tonkatsu&t=ffab&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images).", "Yeah I did. Did you?\n\nHe's saying it's all fine but oh look she thinks they're awful people and they've excluded a wife from a couples vacation.\n\nI think he's probably either been wilfully blind or genuinely dense and his friends are probably acting worse than he wants to know about.\n\nBecause no real friends would force a husband to pick between them and a spouse. They could have chosen not to invite him as well but they picked the route most hurtful and he's going along with it.", "This little club where everyone met during their undergrad and have been tightknit for years except OP's wife. He's just let them push her out completely. It's like he doesn't even like this woman.\n\nShe never stood a chance.", "I can't properly say I don't trust him or do trust his version of events, considering I've seen this situation happen either way several times and been on both ends of it. \n\nIt's really disheartening when a partner doesn't get along with friends. My ex always called our friends (we met these people at the same time and only ever interacted with them when we together) \"my friends\" because she wasn't social with them and didn't try to make an effort with them. I'm not even sure why to be honest, she's a pretty social person but ah well. I can't ask at this point in time. \n\nAnd then I've been the person that never felt part of the group. Honestly, if they invited me or didn't, it didn't matter to me truly. But they always did extend the offer as well. It was just difficult to find like interests (They were car people - I hardly understood car speak LOL) \n\nSo it's.. it's difficult to say without further context or detail.", "They have made a decision: she's an outsider. That's something that has probably in the subtext of many interactions. As if she was \"trying out\" for a spot on the team. \n\nNevertheless, op will have to make a decision.", "Yeah, I was *almost* on OP's side and thought maybe she was just being insecure around his friends. Like, he made it sound as though she was the only one who didn't attend a university at all, and maybe she was insecure about that. \n\nBut towards the end, he mentioned that she merely went to a different university, and she was right about his friends (and him) all along. He basically faulted her for not cancelling plans with her friends to hang out with his.\n\n>would sometimes skip group events to hang with her college friends if she had something else planned.", "It doesn't even sound like a couples vacation, dude just has a friend group that's all paired off with each other", "Maybe. But it also sounds like the situation has been a long time in the making. OP wants to know if he\u2019s TA for telling his wife it\u2019s her own fault she\u2019s being excluded and by the sounds of it, it is. If she wanted to go, it would be different. But she doesn\u2019t like them and doesn\u2019t want to spend time with them so what, she just wants to ruin it for everyone?! She is TA", "Ok I did it, sorry about that, I'm new to reddit", "YIKES - I hope not lol.", "Bingo!", "Or the Airbnb only has 3 bedrooms and they want him to take the pullout. It be hysterical if that was the case", "I definitely wonder if there's some personality mismatch with her and the group. My bigger guess is that the 7 of them have their set roles in the group and years of inside jokes or memories they bring up. Being the outsider in that really sucks and she won't be able to find her role in the group if they use a lot of inside jokes she'll never understand.", "One of her friends is a HS friend that married her HS sweetheart that they both knew. But the others are a combo of work friends and college friends. So I'd say no other than the HS friend.", "7th wheel.", "I say my boyfriends parents are polite, but not engaging.  They are happy to sit around for hours chit chating, catching up and reminiscing.  I could just as easily be there or at work and nothing would change. They are polite. They say hi, it was nice seeing you, but not much really directed at me all night.\n\nSaying his friends are polite is a red flag for me, so I hope its a bad choice of words.", "I noticed that, too. Why would she cancel her plans to hang out with your friends?", "This is what I am picturing- inside jokes, stories she doesn't share etc...", "Prior to this no. \n\nShe just always said she felt that she wished she had gone to undergrad with us so she felt like she could be a part of the group but it was impossible for her to fit in even though everyone liked her.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Don't forget the bulldog sauce!", "Funny, the one pulling the \"them or me\" is the wife, with the going to her parents house and silent treatment. You know, the manipulation part that you seem to be skipping.", "Yeah ordinarily I'd say there's too little to go on to evaluate his claims. But the fact he is so dismissive of her side and her feelings without any apparent reason to be (like her having a history of being a jerk to them) gives me considerable pause. It's like he's determined to take their side no matter what.", "No, she decided that from day one. Ever heard the expression \"You reap what you sow\"?", "The way that the husband is responding to his friends overstepping his boundaries shows that there was never any hope for her to start with. \n\nAnd to be honest, I understand her lack of interest. This group of friends suck. Husband included. OP doesn't have her back now and didn't have it to begin with.", "It just seems odd to me that they wouldn't extend a courtesy invite to a couples vacation to the second half of a couple. \n\nMy husband went camping with a group of friends a couple of months ago. I had no desire to go. Still got a courtesy invite and even a couple of \"we wish you would come\" from his friends. I am friends with some of the people who attended but not all (I don't even like all of them lol). They would have never excluded me from an invite or banned me from attending.", "So your experiences with her friends aren\u2019t comparable. Hanging out with another couple is not the same as a friend group. Friend groups can be terrifying. And you keep saying they\u2019re \u201cpolite\u201d to her. Polite is different than inviting and engaging. You can be polite to someone, but never really welcome them into the group. YTA for not sticking up for your wife and will continue to be the AH if you go on this trip without her. \n\nMaybe if there is any chance to repair the relationship between your wife and friends, try smaller group settings. Go to dinner with one other couple. Let your wife get to know them and socialize in smaller settings.", "Man, I\u2019m going to be honest - sounds like they closed ranks and iced her out years ago; you\u2019re just too attached to them to see their fault in it. Being polite is not being friendly and welcoming, and there is little worse than regularly joining a group that has their stories and idiosyncrasies and don\u2019t let you in. I think you may have rose colored glasses on when it comes to your friends.\n\nP.S. It is really, really odd to me that all your group friends married each other. Were they mad you dated and married an outsider?", "\"it was impossible for get to fit in\"?\n\nCan you explain this more?", "What have YOU done to help her feel more comfortable with your friends?", "Doesn\u2019t sound like they like her though considering they just admitted to you that they don\u2019t. I bet she was well aware this whole time and it\u2019s only you who needed it spelled out.", "Does your wife share common interests/hobbies with your friends?", "INFO: the other 6 people are 3 men and 3 women that are married to each other? \n\nHow is the atmosphere when the 7 of you hang out? Do you mention undergrad a lot, have inside jokes and that kind of stuff? How different is your wife from you and your friends?", "The wife left after the husband said something hurtful.\n\nThe friends literally set up an us or her situation.", "Are you OP posting from another account\u2026?", "Would you like someone who actively distanced themself from you for six years?", "No, I just don't have double standards.", "That\u2019s what I think too. OP is commenting from another account.\nGetting away from your spouse who is excluding from a couple\u2019s trip is not at all \u2018emotional manipulation\u2019 that\u2019s some bs", "How did she distance herself? She\u2019s shown up for every get together unless she already had plans. OP said she was always cordial to his friends. Like what else could she have possible done?", "Acting cordial to people who you've known for six years is a decent example of how she had maintained distance from them. That's a very superficial and polite way to interact with people after so long and not great for integrating yourself in a group of people who already know each other well."]}
