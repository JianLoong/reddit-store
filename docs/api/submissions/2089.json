{"id": 2089, "submission_id": "ysxsgm", "title": "AITA for telling my wife it's her own fault for not getting invited on a group trip?", "selftext": "Me (32M) and my wife (31F) have been together for about 6 years. We get along wonderfully and through everything, have never had any major fights except for one thing.\n\nI personally feel like my wife makes no effort to get along with my friends.\n\nNow to give context, all my friends and I went to the same university for undergrad (3 guys and 3 girls that are married). My wife is the only one that did not have this common trait of attending undergrad between the 8 of us, which is really not a big deal if you ask me.\n\nEarly on in our relationship, my friends would always try and be friendly to her and talk to her when we would mutually hang out. My wife was cordial, but you could tell that she was uncomfortable. I would speak with her about this, and she would always comment that she was an \u201coutsider\u201d to all of us.\n\nThis always personally made me slightly miffed because I felt that my friends always made an effort to include her and make sure that she wasn\u2019t singled out.\n\nThroughout the years, my wife would attend events with me but would seem distant and would sometimes skip group events to hang with her college friends if she had something else planned. My friends never said anything but were always nice and treated her kindly.\n\nWell this week I got a group text from my friends about planning a group vacation to somewhere next year. I quickly noticed my wife wasn\u2019t on the group text and asked about it. I got a call from one of my friends who basically said that they didn\u2019t invite my wife because:\n\n1.\tBased on all the previous interactions they didn\u2019t think she would want to attend \n2.\tEven if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don\u2019t want it to ruin the vacation \n\nI thanked my friend for his honesty and told him I\u2019d think about it. And while I love my wife, I figured she more than likely wouldn\u2019t want to go on a vacation with them.\n\nSo I told my wife about the trip, and she asked about details. I told her that while I was invited, she wasn\u2019t, and it wasn\u2019t because of anything she did, but because they thought she wouldn\u2019t want to attend.\n\nWell this statement just seemed to about how she is an outsider. She said that because of the history us 7 had together, she had no chance of ever being a part of the group. She then went on a rant about how my friends are awful people and that she deserved to be invited even if she didn\u2019t want to be there because she is my wife.\n\nI sat there and listened to her vent and then finally I calmly told her that it was pretty much her own fault for not being invited, because she had taken such a hostile stance with them from the get go. She became a self fulfilling prophecy about being an outsider. That\u2019s paraphrasing but something along those lines. \n\nShe left the house and went to her mothers.\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to her in several days despite texts and phone calls to try and talk to her. I probably should have been more diplomatic about what I said, but I do feel my friends have been treated unfairly.

That's OK not everyone has to be buddy buddy.\n\nWhat's not OK is excluding someone's spouse from a trip where all the spouses are going. That's AH territory.\n\nThen you went and blamed your wife for their behaviour.\n\nWhat I would have done was assumed that your wife was probably right on the way she's claimed she's been treated.\n\nAlso it is really hard to break into a close knit friend group, you say they made an effort but based on this post it sounds like they might have made a very superficial attempt to be polite and your wife picked up on that.", "Why would you even want to go on a couples vacation, alone, with 3 other couples?

Your friends are actively excluding her and you're okay with it. I wonder how many times they did this in front of you where you just ignored it or made excuses for their behavior. Your friends don't seem like very good people. Why don't you make it fair and suggest they leave their wives at home.", "YTA for being willing to exclude your wife.\n\nYour friends don't make your decisions, you do. It sounds like there's more going on between your wife and friends then you're mentioning, or maybe more than you care to notice or take seriously which makes sense, since you don't seem to think them excluding her is serious. I bet she's brought up legitimate issues about them with you before. \n\nAlso, you've mentioned hanging out with her friends in the comments but I've only seen you mention the golfing with one couple, that's it. You have a friend group that's much larger and I bet the college buddies or college stories come up a lot when you hang out. Maybe compare the conversation her friends make with you vs. the conversation your friends make with her and see if there's a difference.", "YTA. This is your wife. She absolutely has been an outsider since day 1. You had 4 years of life and inside jokes with these people before her and it was your responsibility to help her fit in. You said your friends were nice to her, but there\u2019s inclusion and there\u2019s pity nice, how\u2019s the weather type of nice. I felt the same as your wife in my past relationship. Felt like he had a second life I was excluded from. He blamed me for not fitting in too but he did nothing to help. Just left me with the other females of the group. I\u2019m so glad that relationship ended. If you want to keep your wife you need to make drastic changes.", "Your friends who are three couples invited you on a trip and specifically excluded your wife? That\u2019s rude to both you and her, and YTA for then blaming your wife who indeed is treated as an outsider. You say she\u2019s always polite to them and sometimes has other plans, which is totally normal. I don\u2019t know why you aren\u2019t angry on your own behalf much less why you blame her for your insular friends not welcoming your wife even if just for you.", ">Even if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don't want it to ruin the vacation\n\nWhat the hell are you doing allowing your friends to get away with saying something like this about your partner?\n\nYou should have said no to the trip the second you found out they excluded your wife and taken your shitty friends to task for saying something so degrading about her.\n\nEven if my SO hated someone in my life, if a group of them all got together and deliberately excluded them but included me in a holiday then told me it's because they have a crappy attitude and ruined everyone's mood, I'd just defend them and refuse to go because this is all just horribly cruel, immature, and unfair.\n\nYour wife is right to be hurt and upset by these events. You're husband and wife, you're supposed to look out for one another, whether your partner's in the room or not, especially when they're not. So, why are prioritising your friend group and their exclusionary holiday over your spouse? And then you told her it was her fault as well. Smh.", "Sort of want to go with ESH, but you haven\u2019t explained how your wife has acted towards them, is she outwardly hostile to them or is she polite? If she\u2019s nice to them YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a hard one, I think it\u2019s strange to be ok with your friends not inviting your wife on a holiday and and not standing up for your wife is a dick move. It would be incredibly intimidating being the new person in a group of friends who have all known each other for many years and are married to each other, to say it\u2019s not a big deal is ridiculous! \nThat being said if she gave up on trying to be friends with your friends that is a bad move on her part considering they sound very important to you, if she\u2019s just accepted that she and them will only be friendly instead of friends that\u2019s kind of normal? Not everyone becomes best friends with their partners friends. You need to sort it out regardless because outright confirming to her that they don\u2019t like her is going to cause a bigger rift between them now. Honestly your friends need to grow up because that\u2019s your wife, you\u2019re a package deal, they can\u2019t just exclude her all the time. Unfortunately with you telling her this I don\u2019t see how she will get past it.", "YTA - so she was right all along. She is an outsider, they do exclude her and you are an active participant in this. \n\nDon\u2019t you dare go on this trip without your wife. That would be an absolute shitty thing to do to her.", "ESH. Your wife either dislikes your friends or is intimidated by your tight-knit-ness and that made her defensive from the get-go, but either way, she has not made any efforts to stop being an outsider. \n\nI know her position quite well, as my husband is very close with his group of friends from college, several of them also went to law school together and they have their own lawyer buddy sub-group. I was an outsider when I met them a little under ten years ago, but now, some of them I consider them friends myself, and I have a cordial although maybe not so close relationship with the rest (with exceptions, as my post history gives away hah). That didn't happen overnight, but they mostly made efforts to get to know me and include me, and I made the same effort to get to know them and integrate. Your wife didn't. She might have her reasons and she's not obligated to be friends with your friends, but she can't blame the distance solely on them. \n\nThat said, your friends absolutely crossed a line by inviting you and not your wife to a couples trip. That's beyond rude and classless of them. And you should've shut that down the moment you were told! Regardless of whether she'd like to go, she is your wife and it's completely inappropriate they exclude her. If anything they should've excluded you both and told you that they were sorry but since they didn't want her to come, neither of you was invited. It'd still be AH behavior but it wouldn't be as crass as inviting a man and not his wife to a trip with all married couples. \n\nFinally, your wife tried to express her feelings to you. It was an opportunity for communication and for maybe trying to see where the root of this distance between her and the friend group comes from. Instead, you used her vulnerability against her, told her it's all her fault, and quite literally took your friends' side over hers, when she is the one being excluded. \n\nEveryone is an AH here, but you need to rethink your priorities because you're putting your marriage second to your friendships.", "YTA - you \u201cfelt they made an effort\u201d and thought \u201cthey were always polite\u201d but obviously she\u2019s never felt included in the group, and you are still so caught up in how you perceive things and trying to decide how she should\u2019ve felt about it.", "YTA, and you should be doing some serious reflection on how you\u2019re treating your wife and her emotions. \n\nYou paint yourself as the picture of rationality here, but the story instead speaks to someone who simply doesn\u2019t care to understand the complexity of their partner feeling othered. \n\nINFO: What have you done to make your wife more comfortable with your friends? What have you asked of them? What have you changed, yourself? \n\nI\u2019m sorry her discomfort and attempts to compromise have caused you such grief. And I hope she respects herself enough to stop compromising, as she seems to be the only one making an attempt.", "YTA, it doesn't matter how your wife has behaved in the past to your friends, them not inviting YOUR WIFE on the trip is wrong, you 2 are a pair. You shouldn't have even entertained the idea after they excluded YOUR WIFE.", "NTA\n\nMaking friends is hard and requires effort... For 6 years your partner did not put any effort in.\n\nReap wat you saw.... And she didn't saw anything!\n\nPs. My partner has a bit the same, so i feel your struggle. Although in my case all partners are \"new friends\". And everybody gets along except my partner is \"always tired\". \n\nYour friends are right... If your partner *would* come along then it would be for the location and not for the friendship. And I bet it's the other way around for y'all. At least your partner should be honest and admit it's not about the people....\n\nNTA... But she can still fix the relationship if you both work on it.", "I've seen this situation hundreds of times and been part of it on either side quite often. Honestly, your friends made the effort dozens of times it seems, every single time your wife would be there, from what it sounds like, they did make the most effort they could to talk to her.\n\nBut you can't talk to someone who isn't willing to, otherwise it's like pulling teeth and conversation seems forced into shallow subjects of \"how's the weather / hows the job\", etc. If you constantly make yourself an outsider in situations, you are going to be an outsider. \n\nThat being said, she *is* your wife and your friends know you two should be a package deal. Even if they don't like it, it's still a courtesy to extend the invitation towards your wife as well. \n\nESH and OP, I think in the future, or even now, you are probably facing a harsh reality and decision that will more than likely come down to your friends or your wife.", "YTA- it maybe that your wife is not comfortable because she doesn\u2019t have anything in common besides you with these friends? She doesn\u2019t get the inside jokes or references since she didn\u2019t go to the same school as you all? It could be completely innocent but still make her feel like not a part of the group.

Yea, it hurts that she wasn't invited but when she's had 6 years to be friendly and hangout to get to know your friend group, there's no reason for her to be mad that she wasn't invited when she didn't make the effort other than \"being cordial\".", "YTA this is a vacation.

I have been in a similar position and it\u2019s frustrating when you feel like your SO isn\u2019t making an effort but you\u2019re not listening to her and you\u2019re just dismissing what she\u2019s saying. It is hard to fit in with a group that\u2019s known each other for a long time. Sometimes people are making an effort but they still can\u2019t force themselves to feel comfortable and that can be difficult to hide. It doesn\u2019t mean anything bad about your wife or your friends, it is what it is.\n\nThat said, I went into this story thinking there might be extenuating circumstances that make you not the asshole but there are none. Your friends are major assholes for putting you in this situation and it\u2019s them you should be mad at. You\u2019re an asshole for even considering this when it was explained to you.", "YTA You and your friends should have let her decide whether or not she wanted to go, not decide for her. Also, you should always be on her side. If she's not invited, you shouldn't go either.\n\nETA: If it's really true that you get along wonderfully except for this one issue, then maybe the two of you simply don't have a lot of experience with negotiating conflict. Maybe you should see a counselor together to work through this one issue.", "Major YTA. Just know if you go on this trip without your wife, that will lead to the path of your divorce.", "ESH you may have felt your friends were welcoming however she may not have felt the same as evidenced by her stating she felt like an outsider. Were you always with your wife at these gatherings or did you leave her to talk with them. Unless you were with her all the time you have no idea what was said or done when you weren\u2019t together. It is entirely possible they made her feel like an outsider. She should have been more direct in why she felt like an outsider however you should have asked as well. I know from experience that people can be friendly when their friends are around and then turn on the newcomer when they are alone. If you go on this couples trip without your wife you WBTA. The fact that your friends felt they could exclude her and that you seem ok with it tells me there is something being left out of the narrative either you\u2019re friends or yours", "YTA and so are your friends.  Not everyone has to be friends, but the fact that your wife is the only person excluded on a couples vacation proves that they are being exclusive.   Why do even want to go on a couples trip as the single guy?  Why do you think it\u2019s okay for your friends to basically insult YOUR WIFE to your face?  Your friends basically told a husband that his wife sucks, but hey, that\u2019s totally okay.  Would you be okay if your wife\u2018s friends said you suck, and she then thanked them for telling her that?  Plus, if your wife is always cordial, why is her attitude crappy and hostile?  Are you all in high school?  Does your wife need to be the life of the party, attend every event or act a certain way in order to be invited to a group function?  Because if she does, your friends sound more like a teenage clique than anything else.  OP, maybe try seeing things from your wife\u2019s perspective and place your MARRIAGE first (and maybe get better friends), or you won\u2019t need to worry about taking vacations alone in the future because you won\u2019t have a choice.", "NTA.

Why are you yelling at your wife to get along with people who are hostile to her, Why not yell at your friends, they need to make her feel more included. Why choose your friend over her, and expect that she should ditch her friends for yours when it doesn't look like you would even ditch your friends for her?

It is not your fault you have old friends from before you met her and that you have history with them she can't share. That's life. Life is imperfect. She could have chosen to make a new chapter of history with them with you and her included; instead, she was a deliberate wet blanket and alienated herself further because she couldn't immediately participate in all of the group dynamics in exactly the same way, due to her being the most recent member.", ">She then went on a rant about how my friends are awful people and that she deserved to be invited even if she didn\u2019t want to be there because she is my wife.\n\nNTA jeez, they aren't entitled to invite her nor does she \"deserve\" it, knowing likely she won't come and if she does, she'll act crappy like she has in the past.

We get along wonderfully and through everything, have never had any major fights except for one thing.\n\nI personally feel like my wife makes no effort to get along with my friends.\n\nNow to give context, all my friends and I went to the same university for undergrad (3 guys and 3 girls that are married). My wife is the only one that did not have this common trait of attending undergrad between the 8 of us, which is really not a big deal if you ask me.\n\nEarly on in our relationship, my friends would always try and be friendly to her and talk to her when we would mutually hang out. My wife was cordial, but you could tell that she was uncomfortable. I would speak with her about this, and she would always comment that she was an \u201coutsider\u201d to all of us.\n\nThis always personally made me slightly miffed because I felt that my friends always made an effort to include her and make sure that she wasn\u2019t singled out.\n\nThroughout the years, my wife would attend events with me but would seem distant and would sometimes skip group events to hang with her college friends if she had something else planned. My friends never said anything but were always nice and treated her kindly.\n\nWell this week I got a group text from my friends about planning a group vacation to somewhere next year. I quickly noticed my wife wasn\u2019t on the group text and asked about it. I got a call from one of my friends who basically said that they didn\u2019t invite my wife because:\n\n1.\tBased on all the previous interactions they didn\u2019t think she would want to attend \n2.\tEven if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don\u2019t want it to ruin the vacation \n\nI thanked my friend for his honesty and told him I\u2019d think about it. And while I love my wife, I figured she more than likely wouldn\u2019t want to go on a vacation with them.\n\nSo I told my wife about the trip, and she asked about details. I told her that while I was invited, she wasn\u2019t, and it wasn\u2019t because of anything she did, but because they thought she wouldn\u2019t want to attend.\n\nWell this statement just seemed to about how she is an outsider. She said that because of the history us 7 had together, she had no chance of ever being a part of the group. She then went on a rant about how my friends are awful people and that she deserved to be invited even if she didn\u2019t want to be there because she is my wife.\n\nI sat there and listened to her vent and then finally I calmly told her that it was pretty much her own fault for not being invited, because she had taken such a hostile stance with them from the get go. She became a self fulfilling prophecy about being an outsider. That\u2019s paraphrasing but something along those lines. \n\nShe left the house and went to her mothers.\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to her in several days despite texts and phone calls to try and talk to her. I probably should have been more diplomatic about what I said, but I do feel my friends have been treated unfairly. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "INFO: OP I think we're missing some important information. Is there a reason why your wife doesn't get along with your friends? Are there significant personality differences? Is your wife an introvert or something? And perhaps are your friends much more extroverted? Do you think there's a chance that there's a chance that friends aren't as nice and welcoming as you say they are? Or does your wife think they do or say things that she finds objectionable? Does your wife simply have less friends or her friends aren't as close, so she feels a bit jealous and/or lonely? \n\nI'm asking these questions trying to figure out why your wife feels excluded and even if she does why it bothers her so much when she wasn't invited to join the vacation (which based on what you've said would make her miserable anyway).", "YTA. \n\nLet\u2019s say you go\u2026is it worth having your wife always resent you for it? Is it worth your partner being gone right now and later fighting with in the days before/after the trip? \n\nThis will drive a wedge between you two if you go. As it is, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s already hurting and thinking that you\u2019ve chosen people who didn\u2019t even want to invite her. \n\nActually, them not inviting her is a quite telling. Also, they invited you knowing that this could create an issue in your marriage. Their comfort (or whatever) meant more to them than sparing their boy this trouble. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t roll out an invite to one of my friends knowing what it could lead to\u2014it\u2019s common sense. If I was this uncomfortable with a friend\u2019s partner, I wouldn\u2019t invite either of them and spare them this shitshow.  \n\nMaybe you two should divorce and you find someone single closer to your friends circle? **A little sarcasm** \n\nRespectfully, this is absurd. You\u2019re married. Be the partner your wife needs you to be and tell your friends that, while you apologize that your wife isn\u2019t close to them, that you will not be going and that you hope that they\u2019ll respect your decision. Once you\u2019ve done that, call your wife and tell her that you love her and that you two will plan your own mini getaway.", "I\u2019m going to go with a soft ESH, but was almost NAH.\n\nSo for full disclosure OP for a good 70% of your post I almost wondered if my other half had written this post - then I got to the end and saw you had gone along with her not being invited on the trip!! Eek!\n\nMy other half has an incredibly tight knit group of uni friends, all of whom have been perfectly polite and friendly - they\u2019re all lovely people. But when they get together as a group oh my GOD I could not converse. They had known each other for so long and were so close the inside jokes were rampant, sentences didn\u2019t even need to be finished for everyone to erupt into laughter (\u201chey guys remember when Pete did the-\u201c \u201cOMG YES HAHAHA that was so funny\u201d), every other story was about their shared time together. Now this totally wasn\u2019t intentional of them but I had absolutely no way of joining in, and I did feel like an outsider! I brought it up to my boyfriend and thankfully he took me seriously, listened, watched and saw it happening. He made an effort to bring the conversation back to me, but it rarely worked - so we made a deal. He would pick the events that were most important to him (which, by the way, 100% includes group trips) and I would go along - aside from that I would do my own thing, with my friends, where I could actually contribute more than one word to the conversation.\n\nNow I don\u2019t know your group\u2019s dynamic from the post, i don\u2019t have all the facts, it just struck a chord with me because it\u2019s very similar to how my boyfriend saw it initially before listening to my perspective.\n\nYour wife should be more communicative with you on why she felt like an outsider, you should absolutely have not thought about the trip if she was not invited\n\nEDIT: totally forgot - your friends also suck for not inviting her, saying she had a crap attitude when it sounds like she hasn\u2019t been rude to them at all. Very cliquey mean behaviour, not really acceptable in adulthood", "I feel like this phrasing is really telling: \n\n\"my wife ... would sometimes skip group events to hang with her college friends if she had something else planned.\"\n\nSo, you're describing nights when you hung out with your college friends, and she hung out with hers. But you're describing it as her \"skipping\" your event to do her own thing. Weren't you just as much \"skipping\" her group event to hang out with your friends? \n\nThe whole vibe from your post is that you are centering your college friend group, not your marriage. That friend group is your primary relationship, and it'd be great if your wife could fit in better, but she doesn't, and so you continue to primarily hang out and vacation with your friends, and your wife either joins or \"skips\". Where is your marriage in this? When do you hang with her friend group from college, and how well do you fit in with them? Or does it not matter to you whether you fit in with them? Why do you get to continue with your close-knit friend group you have history with, while the only acceptable social circle for your wife is to join yours? \n\nAlso, not inviting someone because you assume they won't want to go is BS. If that's the only issue, invite them, they can decide for themselves if they want to go. That's not why they aren't inviting her and you know it, you even said it. It's one thing to go on a separate vacation from your spouse, for a hobby you don't share or girls/guys trip. But this is a group of married couples, and you're considering being the only one there without your spouse. If this friend group is so important to you, bring your wife on the trip and see it as another opportunity for them to bond. Or, vacation with your wife and let your friends go without you if they're not interested in inviting both of you. You're a couple, you should be a package deal on a couple's trip. \n\nLook, maybe your wife is really being a real pill to your friends and making zero effort. But on the other hand, maybe you're underestimating how uncomfortable it can feel to be the only one in the room not a part of a close-knit group, with tons of inside jokes, shared history, and bonding that you can just never fully catch up to. Have you really tried facilitating bonds between your wife and some of your friends? Created opportunities for her to hang out with them in smaller groups, one-on-one, or without you there? 1:1 interactions are easier to find common ground with someone, 7:1 you're just going to get lost and forgotten as everyone else gravitates toward those they already know well and feel comfortable with, even if they politely ask you questions now and then to make an effort. \n\nIf you value your marriage, you're going to need to do some reflection here, and definitely don't go on that trip and leave her behind and uninvited. \n\nYTA, but you don't have to continue to be.", "ESH. Your wife, because your friends have tried repeatedly to include her and she has thrown it  back in their faces.

What have they done to make her feel included?\n\nYour wife \u201cskips\u201d group events if she already has something planned??  That\u2019s not skipping out on anything; that\u2019s just her being unable to attend because she has other plans.  Also, her occasionally not going to group events because she doesn\u2019t want to is completely normal.  It\u2019s not like she refuses to hangout with your friends.\n\nIdk if there\u2019s some missing context, but it sounds like your wife has been telling you for years that she\u2019s uncomfortable around your friends and feels like she\u2019s an outsider, but she still hangs out with them and is nothing but nice/cordial around them.  Nothing you\u2019ve mentioned warrants her specifically being told she\u2019s not allowed to come on a couples/group vacation.

Your wife's attitude is shitty but you are shittier in this case by telling her her feelings are invalid basically.", "Info: Are you planning on going on the trip without your wife, since they aren't changing their minds on not inviting her?", "Why would you WANT to hang out with people who willingly exclude your wife?

It's true you can't make your friends invite her but you can do a lot more for your wife and your marriage. Your approach is quite telling that you both need to work on communication. \nYou first started off saying to your wife that it's not anything she did to not be invited which feeds into her thought process of being the outsider. Than she vents about it than you contradict that statement and tell her if she wasn't so hostile towards your friends than things might be different. You didn't have to be more diplomatic but you should have been more direct on what you mean otherwise it is confusing. \n\nYou statement about it not being anything she did was a white lie so you could soften the blow. Why? That is the question? Seems to me it was so you thought she would agree and move on so you could go on the trip with no guilt.\n\nYou wife is civil towards you friends but she is not one of the friends. She probably is uncomfortable around them and they pick up on it. Everybody probably wouldn't have have fun in a group vacation till she and them get over the awkwardness and just be.

It's been 10 years, at this point in marriage, your friends become hers and hers become yours. 2) I think she is being too hard and immature about the way she is communicating. There is so much to unpack and this needs to be done by talking. I find behaviors like this annoying. Although, it looks like this whole ordeal hurt her more than it seems.\n\n2) If it is a couples trip, you always always invite the partner. You get along or not. If your wife has declined these many years, she would have declined this one too. It almost seems like ganging up against her. And they are inviting you. Unless, they have planned to get rid of you too, this is not a good move. \n\n3) Why did your wife's upsetting make you feel she deserved it? You are a unit. They not inviting her  equals they not inviting you or respecting your choice of partner. While I can see why you said what you said, your friends are not saints. They are in the wrong here to exclude her. Also, dude, get some new friends outside of college. They aren't growing up and they aren't letting you grow up.", "Um, because it is mostly her fault.

And also the fact that he skimmed right over the rather pointed insult about his spouse to focus on the fact that it's okay for her to be snubbed because she wouldn't want to be there.\n\nI've also seen variations of this basic argument from both sides IRL in friend groups in integrating someone's significant other, and it can certainly be awkward from both sides, even if everyone is well-meaning and making an effort. Hell, I'm kind of a socially awkward person who often ducks out of social events myself, even without the added complication of a significant other, but people in my social circles still do me the courtesy of inviting me and letting me know I'll be welcome if I feel up to being there, and it is something that I sincerely appreciate, even if I ultimately just can't bring myself to attend.\n\nBut the friends here escalated this drastically by not giving her a courtesy invite (regardless of their own thoughts on her) and making it very clear she was absolutely not welcome. It makes me think there's some substantial information missing from this post.

Your friends are second, third, fourth, and so on down the list on things important in your life. Below your wife. Below your work. Your wife might have help make the situation to what it was; but your friends made it clear that they did not want your wife around them cause THEY do not like her. \n\nYou also lied to your wife. You said it was nothing she did, but you say they told you \"Even if she did want to attend, her attitude is crappy and they don\u2019t want it to ruin the vacation\". Well if that is how they feel fine. You can still be friends with them. But you should have back the hell up from their vacation. You could have got onto the group chat and make it clear, but your being a coward instead of standing up for your wife. \n\nYOU go, your marriage is done and you would deserve it. But what you should do, is get on the group chat and say you will not be attending. Make it clear that your wife may have added to issues, but she clearly did not feel as apart of the group to be more involved. You nor them can decide what would be enough for her to be ok with how things are. And you and them do not need to have to have your wife around to be friends. But you can not and will not be making group functions if there is a need by them to not include your wife. \n\nYour words again, might be correct. She making her own self proclaimed prophecy on being a outsider true. BUT it is clear she felt that way before your friends made it a fact to you. So maybe, there is more to it for your wife, and you should be a good husband and stand by her, stand up for her, but make sure there is a clear understanding your friends do not have to be her friends, and her friends do not have to be yours.

Your concern is that THEY have been treated unfairly because they ganged up on and singled out one spouse of 6 years and said she was not welcome in their little clique.

It basically tells you to choose between your friends or your wife. She\u2019s always been there unless she had prior plans with her friends and has never put you in this kind of position. She has more respect for you than your friends do.

So no matter how hard wife tries she'll never fully fit in.", "This exactly. My husband and I moved to his hometown so of course there are going to be a lot of inside jokes and banter. However, my husband's friends always explain the jokes to me to make sure I'm included.

If they aren't rude then op is spinning tales.", "Eh I can kind of see where you're coming from.

While I don't agree with the alienating abuse thing, i still think OP is TA. There are some other things to think about: What does his friends perhaps do behind his back that makes her so uncomfortable? I have a feeling that the friends aren't as angelic to her as you think.\n\n Regardless, not fitting in with a group of people isn't crime. Being brought into a group where you only know one person and the rest are people you don't really know or vibe with IS uncomfy. How do you know for sure she isn't putting in an effort? Maybe at the beginning she did and she just decided that his friend group aren't the type of people she really connected with and preferred her own friend group? Isn't that normal lmao? What really makes him TA in my eyes though, is the fact that he's not even attempting to see it from her point of view. He just expects his wife to instantly befriend people she is uncomfortable around.

What did she ruin?", "That is true but if they are all old friends when they meet up it is pretty common place for most conversations to revolve around the past, wouldn\u2019t you agree? While they can make new memories if the friend group is so hung up on reminiscing about the old times there is no room for the wife to be included in new times and on top of of that when they are going to make new memories such as the vacation they planned OPs wife could be included and then they could all share new memories", "> The rest of them have spouses too - seems like they are able to integrate fine.\n\nMy understanding is the other 6 are all couples who met in college and got married to each other.

And he'd never be able to stand one of those. And I'm not friends with his friends, just friendly, if that makes sense.", "Because while you may not get along with them they are decent people. The same cannot be said for OP\u2019s friends.", "To me that is the most damning. That they decided on excluding her while also excluding him from that discussion.

That\u2019s fine honestly, not everyone needs to like each other, I don\u2019t like some of my boyfriends friends. The difference is that I recognize my boyfriend does and they\u2019re still part of the friend group so I would never exclude them or act rudely to them.

Better than everyone lying. Basically what's happening is the wife is making OP choose between her and his friends. And it's because she refused to try getting along with them from what we can tell.

My friends and family knew something was up but not what, so didn't like him and that caused isolation so he was able to do it more. But it started with one meal a week after we'd been together for months. Then it slowly worked up. Eventually I was actually ill. But everyone kept telling me I looked great because they didn't see when I took my shirt off my ribs were sticking out.

Them doing this was unnecessarily hostile and he shouldn't have agreed to go without her being invited as well.", "I think you're wrong. It's not on completely on her. She tried, the friends tried (i guess?), doesn't sound like he tried. And them just not meshing isn't a reason to deliberately say that *his wife* wasn't welcome. But it seems he also puts more importance on his friends than hers, just by the way he worded some things. So I really don't think it's her.

Yeah that's when they were dating what's his face! I was working at this restaurant at that time. You remember we would all go and get pizza after this class? What was the name of that place? Etc\"\n\n>Your wife had to sit there and listen silently. It's like traveling to a place where you don't know the language but all of your friends do. She could have interrupted the conversation and asked for an explanation and timeline of events so she could follow the conversation but it would have interfered with the flow of conversation and bonding. She chose to sip her drink quietly, metaphorically speaking. I think it was your job to teach her the language and make sure she felt included. The fact that she still doesn't feel comfortable with them after you've been together this long means you didn't do your job.", "Most definitely. Deliberately saying that she wasn't welcome is absolutely horrible. Only thing that's worse is OP not standing up for her or taking her side by declining to go.", "Thank you it was forever ago it feels like and another life in a way. I just had a 12th anniversary with the love of my life.\n\nBut as for OP, the wife refused to try fitting in with his friends whose spouses all managed, to the point that they talk about a \"bad attitude,\" and is now refusing to speak to him for saying that they don't think she'd enjoy a vacation with them. Refusing to speak is known to be a sign of abuse now. \"I won't talk to you until you give me what I want.\" That's not ok. It makes me wonder what else might be going on that even OP doesn't realize.", "If anything it seems more like he\u2019s trying to isolate her.

I\u2019m sure we are guilty on reminiscing in front of people who can\u2019t join and maybe that\u2019s why she feels left out and awkward.

I'm not a particularly social person so I come across as very quiet/standoffish in groups.

I don't see that being an issue \n\nI do see not even being invited on a couple's holiday being an issue. Its not really something I've had to deal with but if my husband was to turn around and say he was going away with 4 other married couples and I wasn't invited I'd be very uncomfortable. When I have gone on mixed trips (many years ago, before marriage and children) I invited him along but he chose to stay home as he wasn't interested in rugby games or going to London for a weekend. I likewise turned down trips to music festivals etc because it's my idea of hell...but we were both invited and given the choice. It sounds like you aren't really that bothered that your wife is excluded...but more checked just to seem to be doing the done thing. I don't blame her for ignoring you...\n\nYTA.", "YTA.

I honestly hated being around them, but would show my face occasionally to make sure we weren't completely ostracised. It never made a difference, and I just stopped going to any of their events a few years ago. \n\nMy husband and I are now living apart and looking to start divorce proceedings as soon as we can afford it.

I had already met his parents but I was meeting his best friends for the first time on this trip. we all went to his favorite restaurant with his family and his friends (about 15 people total). when one of his friends B, got there he said hi and to me and then started talking to D, my bf. when his other best friend Z got there with his gf BE, they didn't acknowledge me. we were there for almost 3 hours, and in that time span they did not speak a single word to me. I talked to his grandma more than I talked to D, which I was fine with bc he hadn't seen them in forever. but with that being said, I was extremely anxious about meeting them bc they were so important to him and I felt extremely shut out bc his family and friends are very close. I think his grandma could tell bc she went out of her way to talk to me multiple times (bless that woman, she always makes me feel included) which helped calm my nerves a little but it was still a little hurtful. at one point, I heard Z mention something about cars and me being raised by a car guy, I perked up and tried to chime in. Z looked at me and then turned around and started another conversation. BE also heard me and turned away from me. \n\nhere's where my bf and OP differ. bc of my anxiety, we were supposed to do a smaller meet up with just B, Z, and BE so I could meet them in a smaller setting but scheduling just never worked out. so to make up for that, we were supposed to go to Z and BE's apartment after the lunch to hang out with just me, D, B, Z, and BE. however, while I was getting ready, I told D that if things did not go well at lunch (in general not just with them) I would stay at his parents house so I could calm down and spend time with the people I already knew and felt more comfortable with. after the subject change, I went to the bathroom to breathe and then texted him saying I was going to stay at the house. he said okay bc he knew how anxious I was. when we got to the house before he left he asked if I was sure I didn't want to go and I told him what happened. I made sure to tell him B had talked to me a couple times from across the table and that he acknowledged me and that I wasn't upset with him just slightly hurt that Z and BE didn't even acknowledge me. D sat there, listened to me, and validated my feelings and said he would text me when he got there and when he left. I told him to have fun and that I loved him and would see him soon. when he got back I asked him what they did and how it was and he told me he talked to them and said how it wasn't acceptable that they excluded me and that they could not do that again. D never blamed me and apologized to me that a) they didn't acknowledge me and b) that he didn't notice at the restaurant. I told him he had no reason to apologize to me bc it wasn't his fault and that I was just glad he got to see them again and that he had fun. and that was that. we made plans for how we wanted to proceed and came to an agreement that we were both happy with. \n\nOP did none of these things. he did NOT side with his wife, he did NOT validate her.

I'm pretty sure he's mentally (blames her) and emotionally (ignores her feeling) abusive and this was just too much for the wife.

It's not known if OP's wife's efforts to get to know OP's friends are really genuine from this telling of the story. The story is very, very biased, and OP doesn't go into a lot of details which makes ppls' statements purely opinion. And people lie about reality through opinion statements all the time. \n\nOP isn't going to lie about an emotional response, however, and this is an important one. I fully expect a large university group to be bad about having a healthy amount of conversation that guests can pleasantly engage in, and OP doesn't give any evidence they successfully did that to integrate his wife into the friend group. Given that, he should be understanding rather than angry that his wife feels this exclusion that he and his friends have not mitigated for her. They might think they're doing it, but we have no reason to believe they've succeeded. Indeed OP's wife has clearly stated that they haven't. OP being angry at that instead of taking the note makes him TA for me. \n\n(YTA)", "Yes!! I forgot to mention that! I also feel that way with family. It's like my battery dies and I have to run after being with large groups. We introverts are like that and nothing wrong with us, it's just how we are, sadly so many people can't understand the feeling.", "My husband has a set of friends like this. They all worked together at a design firm, and while most of them have moved on to other companies, that\u2019s *all they talk about.* Those projects. Those clients. Remember the time when\u2026? What are you working on now? Oh hey that\u2019s like this project! I\u2019m not in design and none of them make any effort to talk about anything else. To be honest I think they all suck and my husband has been offended about it for a while. He thinks they\u2019re all lovely, but one of them (who has always been particularly cold) straight up walked in a different direction after she saw me at a design talk my husband was giving. I\u2019ve always felt excluded and hanging out with them is always miserable except one time when the cold one brought her husband who is a doctor and he was hilarious. We were excluded together and it was actually fun. One time.\n\nSo yeah. If they make plans, I make plans. I would rather iron my socks, or clean my bathroom with a toothbrush, or trim my dog\u2019s butthole hairs than hang out with them. ESPECIALLY because my husband has always said \u201cyou don\u2019t like my design friends\u201d and thinks they\u2019re nothing but lovely. Luckily this is the only dud group of friends he has and his other friends from school include me, so I know I\u2019m not the problem. Guess that never occurred to my husband.", "Yup this should\u2019ve been included in the original post. YTA OP.", "Wow, it sounds like they are back in high school and they don\u2019t like the girl he chose so they have decided to make her feel as left out as possible.  I would not be surprised if she decided to stay with her mom.  And based on his comments here, he has probably made sure that his friends know she is uncomfortable with them so probably have iced her out more.  \n\nWhen he said that she doesn\u2019t go out with them when she already has plans, I wonder if he is telling them that she is with her friends instead.  It\u2019s just a set up for resentment.", "And can you believe he had the nerve to end this with the comment that his friends are treated unfairly!!!!!  WHAT??? How about his wife that only wished she was part of their group over and over again. She  kept telling him what was happening and he just didn\u2019t listen.", "Yeah. And I think ultimately this is on OP for not doing more to make sure the wife had a way to get integrated into the group.\n\nI have a group of close college friends who is kind of like this one (though at least more people date outside the college group than just yes). And yes, when we all get together it can sometime become very in-groupy and reminiscing about past times and old inside jokes (and that was even more pronounced in our 20s). And there are definitely outside SOs who have commented that it was initially intimidating to be around us as a group.\n\nBut you see the word \"initially\" there? That's because at this point the SOs are PART of the group. And you know how that happened? Thoughtfulness and intentionality on the part of the person they were dating. Making a point of sometimes hanging out with just one or few people from the friend group instead of the whole group, so that the SO had more ability to get to know people as individuals instead of a collective mass, and so that the members of the friend group were more focused on getting to know the SO rather than having fun with their friends while the SO happened to be there. Inviting people to activities the SO liked, instead of it being all about the friend group's wants all the time. Etc. etc. \n\nIt is possible to integrate people into a group like this, but it takes effort.", "I\u2019m autistic and miss social clues sometimes.  I can\u2019t imagine not believing wife, but I can see saying thank you for your honesty.  Like I genuinely do appreciate people being real and up front instead of dancing around playing the social dance and games of trying to be polite and not saying what they\u2019re really thinking.\n\nOf course, id be more inclined to be like, \u201cThank you for your honesty, I really appreciate hearing that directly from you, since this is supposed to be a couple\u2019s event, and I\u2019m not a couple without my wife, I\u2019m gonna have to dip.\u201d\n\nProbably have a good talk with wife then, and friends separately, and figure out a path forward from there then.  (He doesn\u2019t sound very involved with her friends?  I could be wrong.  Ask friends if they like, ever have, liked his wife.  Try to plan something everyone including his wife will like and work on genuine bonding.  Make it known friendship is on the line if they don\u2019t get their acts together and get inclusive.)", "\"Thank you for your honesty, my wife and I are a joint package. It sounds like a great trip and I'm keen to come along, but I will not leave my wife on the outer. \n\nI understand she does not get along as well with the rest of the group as the rest of the group does with each other, I have some ideas about activities we could do where everyone will feel comfortable. What do you guys think about [activity a] or [activity b].\""]}
