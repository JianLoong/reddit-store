These people are super neglecting their dog and endangering it.\n\nThat said, knowingly letting it be destructive and chase people, your neighbors shouldn't be shocked someone finally did something about it.  Large dogs that are poorly trained and managed are dangerous, and I wish it were harder for people to acquire animals they don't intend to properly care for.", "NTA. I hate it when pet owners expect others to respect their decision to own a pet and yet refuse to be a responsible owner.", "NTA- Not only is the dog roaming the streets a public safety risk, but it is also a risk to the dog. Imagine if it bit someone or if it were to be hit by a car. \n\nYou were reasonable. Fingers crossed that they contuine to keep the dog inside and be responsible dog owners.", "NTA it would be different, if the dog would be roaming around in their own yard but if the dog runs everywhere, and the owner just let him do it, it's not okay.", "Nta. You tried and you have a right to walk around your neighborhood w/o fear a Random dog will attack you - it\u2019s a reasonable fear. \n\nIf it was a fenced off front yard and the dog was roaming around in their property, then I\u2019d say you\u2019re over stepping, but a free dog just prowling the neighborhood? Yeah, that is it okay.", "Soft NTA because it\u2019s understandable to want/need the situation to be handled for everyone\u2019s safety, but you definitely should\u2019ve called animal control. \n\nCops are not well equipped to handle these situations properly and I\u2019ve seen too many dogs severely injured or killed by a cop because it runs towards them barking. Animal control is prepared for an animal to act in all sorts of ways and can get law enforcement involved later if needed. Just keep that in mind if it ever happens again or if you see the same dog loose!", "NTA  \nHonestly it's probably illegal for them to let their dog roam like that anyway. It a general nuisance, plus unsafe for people and for the dog as well. They sound like irresponsible pet owners.", "Adding to the soft NTA just because animal control is what was the best route. Hopefully they learned so you won\u2019t need to deal with this but please call AC.", "NCP", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Many areas have leash laws.  Simply stated, dog has to be contained by a physical barrier / fence  or has to be on a rope/chain to keep the dog from leaving the owner's property.   A dog chasing people and pooping on other lawns is probably a clear violation of a local leash ordinance.  But the police can't enforce what they aren't aware of.  You did the right thing.", "NTA  Isn't there a leash law where you live? No one wants a massive dog to chase them anytime they walk outside. Your neighbors are total AH.", "NTA. You did the right thing.", "NTA, you did the right thing! They are the AH for not reading the neighborhood lol.", "NTA\nHarsh? no. This was handled perfectly.\nThe dog was not under control or even contained whilst being a menace to the public.\nThe dog's owner was not responsible, and the authorities were required to resolve the problem", "NTA dogs man, just don\u2019t know when to shut up lol. At least your wanted them many times but they didn\u2019t listen", "NTA, first of all, if they have their dog out, they need to clean. Secondly, fences were invented for a reason. I'm a huge dog person but what they do isn't okay. Thirdly, free roaming dog can be ran over as well as traumatized by other means, it's not safe.", "NTA. Proud dog owner here. Who tf lets their dog roam free in the neighborhood? Don't they know what could happen to the dog? They can get run over, poisoned, injured by others, the dog could injure people or other animals and many more gruesome things. \nI live in Europe and here you can get fined for not picking up the poop after your dog.", "NTA- (though ditto on animal control, hindsight)\n\nDon't feel bad, you likely saved the dog from getting hit by a car.", "10/10"]}
