So you're not actually saving her from feeling uneasy, you're manipulating her into buying a house that will make her uneasy! By not telling her you are simply delaying the inevitable, whereas if you tell her, you give her a chance to make an informed decision. Even best case scenario: you succeed, and buy the house, she never finds out about the murder, then you're still holding a secret from your partner forever. What about if you get drugs for dental surgery and spill the beans? Do you really want a secret hanging over your marriage forever?\n\nThe realtor is also surely offering the house at a discounted rate because of the murder, that's why it seems so good to your wife right now.", "If you buy it she WILL find out at some point.

Cold hearted logic makes you right for you, but YTA for missing the emotional components of love, trust, integrity etc. that goes into a healthy partnership.", "YTA\n\nThis is the story of information that *will* come to light eventually. \n\nThat means that if it is something that would genuinely be a deal-breaker for her, then all you are doing is delaying the problem and moving it down the line.\n\nSo rather than trying to trick her into a house you expect she may have a problem with, be upfront and let her be part of the decision.", "She\u2019s going to find out the moment she meets the neighbours. You need to tell her. If it would set her mind at rest, you could ask a priest to come in and bless the house. Honestly, though, I can imagine being distressed at the thought of living in a house where someone died such a violent death. If she decides that no blessing is strong enough for her to be willing to live there, then you\u2019ll need to keep searching. That\u2019s not unreasonable on her part if so.", "YTA. You don't care, but she does, and you love her, right? Then you need to honor her wishes. Anyway, if you disclose and have a list of resources ready of people who do smudgings or 'cleansings', you may be able to solve the problem for a couple hundred or whatever ghostbusting costs these days.", "From cursory look of the comments, no one mentioned that in some jurisdictions, there's a requirement to disclose such an event and this is likely the case. This is perhaps why the agent mentioned it; not out of transparency but a requirement. With that, two things may happen: (1) there will probably be some paper they need to sign to acknowledge that they understand this and this would be the time the partner would find out and would create a bigger mess at this point in the purchase process. (2) if they are willing to sign off on this and for whatever reason they want to sell, they will need to disclose this to the next buyer if the incident happened within a certain time frame. As such, it may limit the interest of the property and therefore affect the value.", "I bought a home where the owner had died, natural causes. Had no problems", "YTA.

Honestly the way you speak about her like she's just being ridiculous makes me feel queasy", "Look you would be TA for lying to her and omitting the fact.\n\n\nWhy, if you do not believe in ghosts any way, give your partner some recognition for how she feels.\nJust tell her: \"Hey sweetheart, I have some bad news, but I want you to hear me out before you respond. The house we both love? I found out there was a murder there.You know that I do not necessarily believe in those things, but you are definitely more in tune with them. So before we make a decision, I would like to ask how you feel about hiring someone to do a cleansing of the house...Just so that if there is anything lingering, it is laid to rest. I think that would be the way to go for our own peace of mind, but also would be the kind thing to do, if there truly would be some essence left there, whether I believe it or not.", "Not knowing about something doesn't make it magically not exist. Her comfort would be a tedious lie hanging over your relationship waiting to break everything.", "She'll find out.", "NGL, you don\u2019t seem like you expect to stay with this person in the long run based on the way you talk about her. You think that the whole time you\u2019re living in this house together (I\u2019d assume forever btw), that she\u2019s never going to find out, ever? And if she does she\u2019s just going to be okay with the fact that you lied to her by omission? And that she\u2019s just going to suddenly decide she\u2019s fine in the murder house? Just trying to decide why you\u2019re buying a house with someone that you\u2019re so okay with disrespecting and dismissing.", "She will find out.\n\nIf nothing else when you want to resell the house and you need to declare there was a murder there (requirement on many locales) and she finds out the property is devalued because of it.\n\nThere. A nice money based reason to appeal to you and you lack of respect for your partner's worldview.", "Simply put, why do you think you have the right to take her choice away?", "Bro ppl like you kinda piss me off cuz you\u2019re invalidating ppl who legit had experiences. The craziest for me was actually being confused in seeing a ghost/spirit walking with my husband and I when we crossed a street. I still feel gaslighted thinking my husband is lying to me but he never saw the man walking with us despite him being the closest like he was so close that you\u2019d think we\u2019re in a friend group. \n\nMy whole family has dealt with spiritual stuff growing up and one dude who wasn\u2019t native couldn\u2019t bring himself to say he saw a shadow person running up the stairs after it was being a complete weirdo and watching me sleep when I crashed from playing sims. They do exist it\u2019s just that you never experienced it. Just like telling a person Cheetos don\u2019t exist cuz they never had it before.\n\nI forgot to mention this one! My SIL used to live in this fancy house that a child died in and she would hear laughter and ball bouncing she was freaked out and her coworker offered to buy the house cuz he loved that occult stuff. If she\u2019s sensitive to that sort of thing she\u2019ll know. Not by seeing or hearing it but the energy itself sometimes which i have experience before despite not seeing the ghost/spirit.", "\"karmically clean the house by filling it with love\" jesus hahaha.\n\nCould probably convince her by hiring an 'exorcist' tho", "Yes, he is hunting our front gardens to this day. Or so they say (I've only ever encountered cats in the garden at night).", "That will do it.", "I'd buy it!", "I think that OP is just parroting the exact words of the realtor without making the connection. We know that OP is clearly dumb by his actions. Don't attribute malice what can be explained by stupidity.", "How long ago was the murder? Cos \u2018oh yeah, we knew the previous owners, it was terrible what happened to them \u2014\u2018 is pretty common chitchat. But it gets less juicy the further it gets from The Event. Like Seven Shades of Traumatic Death. (Although I don\u2019t believe in ghosts except when I read M.R James. So it would take something like \u2018wasn\u2019t it terrible the way that massive sinkhole opened in the kitchen and just swallowed her whole\u2019 to phase\nMe).", "Murder house buddies ^5", "You do realize that more than half of the people on the planet have some supernatural beliefs, right? Do you think that all those people deserve to have their agency taken away just because they are not atheists?\n\nOf couse, they should not impose their beliefs on other people, but they should still be able to draw some personal boundaries and decide on things like where they live. Even if that does not make much sense to you.", "Plenty of people are superstitious. Doesn't really make someone an ah.", "this is very judgmental. people have different beliefs, & he\u2019s an AH for being so dismissive of his wife. it doesn\u2019t sound like he accepts or respects her or her beliefs.\n\nedit: & that\u2019s also ignoring, you know, the MURDER that took place there, that he\u2019s wanting to hide from her.", "That's actually not a bad comparison - sure, serving different food might not be as big a deal as having to buy a different house, but where is your line in the sand for how inconvenient it has to be before you are willing to hide the truth and do what suits you knowing it would hurt the other person if they knew.", "I haven\u2019t experienced this in real life but it is a recurring nightmare of mine that there are spirits in the house that I live in. If my husband didn\u2019t tell me that our house had a murder in it, I would honestly consider divorcing him. Luckily he had a weird experience in a house where an old lady passed away (his aunt and uncles house, he would only sleep in the part that was added on later because he was so freaked out) and I know he\u2019d definitely disclose this information \ud83d\ude02", "I love this story more and more, lol", "In our case? The victim was the previous owner (and his girlfriend). Probate and cleanup and such took several months, so there was that gap between the event and us buying it. It seems to be a forbidden topic in the neighborhood. I\u2019ve never heard anyone mention it and we\u2019ve lived here for several years now. Some people like to gossip but there\u2019s also people who don\u2019t like to bring this sort of thing up.", "Even atheists can have superstitious beliefs.", "i dont believe in ghosts but i would not want to buy a house where someone was murdered. maaaybe rent it for a short time if i cannot find anything else in my price range, but i would definitely not want to make it my forever home", "Putting aside his disregard of her religious/spiritual beliefs for a second (which is a huge issue), she should get to know about this because it is a factor that changes the homes worth. The fact that something like this happened here effects how many people would buy it, and less demand means it's worth a lower price and could be harder to sell. When deciding what offers to give, that information is important. Just like prior water damage that's theoretically fixed would change a price compared to a home that's never had water damage.", "In my hometown we got this little historical place (I\u2019m Native American) and we were told it was haunted so I\u2019m trying to take pics. I was feeling all disappointed for not feeling or seeing anything (I\u2019m 50/50 skeptical and yet believing) until I was in this one room. Out of nowhere it felt suffocating and had this huge weight just sitting on me. My husband felt it too but didn\u2019t comment on it till we left the room. Then he said there was one room upstairs that made him wanna cry and wanted to see if I could figure which room cuz he felt like he was being weird (99.99% skeptical) and i went into the same room he did and figured which one. It had intense emotions in there and it slowly went away when we went to other rooms. \n\nI had a lot of crazy stuff happening but the one that will be the one mentioned above cuz it happened in Japan. The other would be my sister guessing correctly with my baby picture and knowing my SIL\u2019a future (she guess where she was moving as the end game) whom I never talk about with my sister. She was also like states away from that situation on the baby pics.", "...I am definitely the first type. Although mostly the crime around here has been pretty low-key. Someone was shot, but I think he made it that time.", "exactly! even personal beliefs aside, a murder is a murder, & i think it\u2019s crazy that so much focus is on whether her beliefs are \u2018valid\u2019. most people wouldn\u2019t want that to be a permanent home, i\u2019m with you", "there is a reason why in many countries, realtors are legally obligated to disclose such information to potential buyers"]}
