So you're not actually saving her from feeling uneasy, you're manipulating her into buying a house that will make her uneasy! By not telling her you are simply delaying the inevitable, whereas if you tell her, you give her a chance to make an informed decision. Even best case scenario: you succeed, and buy the house, she never finds out about the murder, then you're still holding a secret from your partner forever. What about if you get drugs for dental surgery and spill the beans? Do you really want a secret hanging over your marriage forever?\n\nThe realtor is also surely offering the house at a discounted rate because of the murder, that's why it seems so good to your wife right now.", "If you buy it she WILL find out at some point. Some neighbour will mention it.

Cold hearted logic makes you right for you, but YTA for missing the emotional components of love, trust, integrity etc. that goes into a healthy partnership.", "YTA\n\nThis is the story of information that *will* come to light eventually. \n\nThat means that if it is something that would genuinely be a deal-breaker for her, then all you are doing is delaying the problem and moving it down the line.\n\nSo rather than trying to trick her into a house you expect she may have a problem with, be upfront and let her be part of the decision.", "She\u2019s going to find out the moment she meets the neighbours. You need to tell her. If it would set her mind at rest, you could ask a priest to come in and bless the house. Honestly, though, I can imagine being distressed at the thought of living in a house where someone died such a violent death. If she decides that no blessing is strong enough for her to be willing to live there, then you\u2019ll need to keep searching. That\u2019s not unreasonable on her part if so.", "YTA. You don't care, but she does, and you love her, right? Then you need to honor her wishes. Anyway, if you disclose and have a list of resources ready of people who do smudgings or 'cleansings', you may be able to solve the problem for a couple hundred or whatever ghostbusting costs these days.", "From cursory look of the comments, no one mentioned that in some jurisdictions, there's a requirement to disclose such an event and this is likely the case. This is perhaps why the agent mentioned it; not out of transparency but a requirement. With that, two things may happen: (1) there will probably be some paper they need to sign to acknowledge that they understand this and this would be the time the partner would find out and would create a bigger mess at this point in the purchase process. (2) if they are willing to sign off on this and for whatever reason they want to sell, they will need to disclose this to the next buyer if the incident happened within a certain time frame. As such, it may limit the interest of the property and therefore affect the value.", "I bought a home where the owner had died, natural causes. Had no problems", "YTA.

A couple moves into a nice looking house that they got for a bargain, and then the neighbours tell them about what happened to the old residents.\n\nI am not saying I would be worried of ghosts based on horror movie plots, but the gossiping neighbours are pretty realistic.\n\nAlso, YTA for infantalizing your wife", "I could live in house someone died in - in any house that is not built recently someone probably did - but even I am not superstitious at all I would get chills from living in a house where someone was brutaly murderd from someone they belived the most, after years of torture. Because that's the way it usually happens.", "But but he couldn't care less", "What if the victim killed the abuser in self defense. That happens sometimes. I think then the description would be accurate. But we don't know because that is all the info OP gave. Still YTA because even as someone who isn't superstitious at all I would want to know.", "In this case he is better than her, it's like not wanting to live in a house without a chimney so that Santa can get in.", "There is no \"if\" with the neighbors. Someone is bound to comment on her \"braveness\" to live in a house where someone was murdered and how \"they wouldn't be able to do it\". Drama like that is as important as air for many people.", "Oh it will be almost immediately.  'oh you are so brave buying that place! ' the first time she talks to a neighbour or local", "It is since it's something that's important to her. I don't believe in stuff like OP's partner, but if it really means that much to her, he should respect that. He should be honest and talk to her about it. I mean, what if she withheld info about the house he wouldn't be comfortable with and then found out later?", "I rented a place knowing someone had died there but it was a little old king term tenant who called the RSL bus and when he didn\u2019t meet them, they organised a wellness check and he had passed in his chair waiting. \n\nI had the choice though and wouldn\u2019t live somewhere a violent death had occurred.\n\nOP, YTA.", "After almost 100 years, the lore has changed to the kid looked at Putin the wrong way.", "Right. Sadly these things happen. Even in the house (well, it's a row of apartment buildings all sharing a wall) I live in I know of at least one man who jumped out the window after some tragic events in his life.\n\nTo be fair, unless it's a newly built building, there is little chance someone won't have passed away in your home, unless you were the first buyer, or bought it from the first buyer. (Come on, there are plenty of houses here in Europe that are multiple decades, if not centuries old! And we can't keep building new houses to avoid that from happening.) Some of it will be violent, some of it due to old age/health issues.\n\nOP could and probably should start the discussion with this imo, not with shaming her for believing in spirits and ghosts (which many people do believe in) but it would be an asshole move to keep the info from his partner.", "I mean, i live in a murder house, and the neighbors never ever mentioned it. But it would have been hard to hide forever. There were news articles. We still get mail for the old owner. Etc.", "Bought a house that the previous owner died in.  We got too much detail about the circumstances by the local gardener.  \n\nThere will always be someone who knows and may share what happened.\n\nYou two are supposed to be a team and you are going behind her back keeping this from her?  That type of action will hurt her trust in you and your marriage when she finds out.  It's not worth it, man.\n\nYTA", "Ghosts don\u2019t exist to YOU. But they very clearly do to HER. It\u2019s concerning to me how pompous you are to act like only your opinion matters in this. It\u2019s like telling someone who is halal they are actually eating pork. Shame on you. Your wife deserves better.", "Which is why you shouldn't buy the house.", "Where is your proof that they don't exist?", "If you can\u2019t be open and honest with your SO, then your relationship isn\u2019t very healthy. Maybe work on that before buying a house.", "It could be, but statisticaly it is mostly the other way around.", "Legally, a house can be haunted if it has a reputation to be haunted. This impacts the property value and quiet enjoyment. There was a couple in New York who sued after moving into house only to find it was a stop on a ghost tour. They didn\u2019t want to live in an infamous house. The seller knew it was supposedly haunted because she\u2019s made the ghost claims herself, in national publications. So when the buyers took her to court to get out of keeping the house since they wouldn\u2019t have bought it if they\u2019d known the Judge said the seller couldn\u2019t claim hauntings aren\u2019t real: as a matter of law the house is haunted.", "Im sorry this is totally besides the point but I love the casual \u201cI live in a murder house\u201d", "Not to mention if she then wants to move out/sell, or her finding out fractures the relationship bc its a big lie, even if it is by omission, given he is aware of her beliefs, it is going to be a hard sell. It is a niche market that would be okay with buying that house. They could stand to lose out financially.", "Oof. Imagine being so disrespectful that you outright shit on your partner's beliefs? \n\nYTA majorly.", "Absolutely! The neighbors will talk.", "Yes and this is most likely fake. OP could also just be parroting the words the realtor used without thinking about it. OP is an asshole but I don't think it's because of his use of language."]}
