The realtor knew, you think no neighbor or local around you knows?", "Why would you want to live in a house that you know your SO would be uncomfortable in?? YTA if you don\u2019t tell her. Imagine how she would react if she found out you knew and kept it from her? Trust would be broken and there would be a crack in the very foundation of your relationship. Telling her is the right thing to do. Best of luck OP!", "YTA. It\u2019s not about whether or not her beliefs are valid, it\u2019s about the fact that she will feel horribly betrayed when she learns about the history of the house. \n\nAnd she will definitely find out eventually, because there\u2019s always at least one nosy neighbour who will breathlessly ask her what it\u2019s like to live in the murder house at the first available opportunity.", "If you don\u2019t tell her and the neighbors do, she\u2019s gonna be pissed.", "YTA. If living *in this specific house* is more important than your wife being able to trust you unequivocally, you've got bigger problems.", "\"Died during a domestic violence incident\"  Someone was MURDERED. And the \"violence\" part means it was likely something brutal. No way your wife doesn't hear about it. I bet neighborhood kids already have stories.", "YTA. You fool, people talk.", "YTA - Lying about something major like this that would change her decision on where to live is never a good idea. It'll usually come back to bite you in the end, and then there's not only the issue, but the lie to deal with. I would suggest mentioning the death, then offer to help her smudge the house with sage and scatter some salt/holy water/whatever she thinks would help in the room where the death occurred. Yes, it's meaningless as far as you're concerned, but not for her, and isn't her peace of mind worth a little harmless ritual?", "Yeah YTA. I agree, ghosts aren't real. But her feelings are. You don't get to chose what is or isn't important to her. Break up if you have this much disdain for your partners beliefs.", "YTA for writing \"died during a domestic violence incident in the house.\" What exactly does that mean other than they were murdered? \"There was a death\" and \"there was a murder\" are pretty different.   \n\n\nYou hold your partner's thoughts and beliefs in contempt and think you are better than her. This is the actual problem.", "YTA you do know neighbors tend to tell new owners these types of situations, right? She\u2019s going to find out, and be pissed when she knows you deliberately didn\u2019t tell her.", "You kinda are the AH by not telling her. Something like what you describe is pretty easy to verify and neighbors, assuming they are the talkative ones, will let something like that out.\n\nIf you really want this house, you\u2019d better tell her. Then agree to whatever she wants to make the house palatable from burning sage and chanting to an exorcism.", "YTA\n\nIf this is known in the community, she will find out one day. Then she will feel unsafe in her house, and if she knows you knew, unsafe around you by extension.", "YTA. Youre not telling her because you know she wont like it. You are tricking her into doing something she wouldnt approve of. You dont get to decide what is important to your partner, you just get to lay out the cards honestly for both parties and find a solution that works. If you cant find an honest solution then you should not be together. \n\nI would never deceive my partner, especially not about something this huge and permanent. And if I did deceive my partner it wouldnt be about something that they are so likely to find out about by googling their own address??? Thats just dumb as a rock ethics aside. And yes this whole idea is a HUGE ethical violation against youe partner.", "Yta- lying to her about something you know she will be upset about is messed up.\n\nAlso, do you really think she won\u2019t make friends with neighbors who might spill the beans ?\n\nJust be honest with her.", "Only if she finds out.       Which she will\ud83e\udd14", "YTA - she will find out. She will talk to a neighbor and it will come up. It may not be today, or a year from now, but it will happen. Then you will have to deal with the fall out plus her being pissed you lied to her. Do not do this.", "YTA", "YTA. You're deliberately lying and keeping something from her to force her into a situation you KNOW she wouldn't be okay with. You're AH for this situation and in general because you do NOT care about her feelings, boundaries, beliefs or right to make well informed decisions for herself.", "YTA that house could be haunted or have bad vibes\nYou need to tell her and let her sage it or something before she decides if she feels comfortable living there.\nIf she's superstitious that would be important to her.\nPresumably she's helping pay for this house so not telling her would be unkind to put it mildly.", "YTA\n\nShe may find out later and resent you for it. Are you *absolutely* sure that nobody in the community or general area will *ever* talk to her at the store or something and mention it in conversation? These things have a way of becoming gossip and being generally known throughout a community.\n\nYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game, my friend. Maybe best to just follow your SO\u2019s wishes on this one.", "You've been told plenty that YTA, and it's right. I just didn't bother reading all the reasons. You may have already received the correct response, but in case you haven't, here it is:\n\nYOU don't have an issue. But that doesn't negate your SO's feelings. You don't get to dictate what is reasonable from their perspective. This all comes down to one question:\n\nDo you respect your partner?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then you tell them the truth and let them make their own decision about whether their love of this amazing place outweighs their superstitions.\n\nIf your answer is no, then you need to break up with them, because you can't have a good relationship where one partner doesn't respect the other.\n\nIt's that simple.", "YTA- her beliefs are valid to her. They don\u2019t have to be valid to you. You will be TA if you do not inform her. If you move in and she finds out from someone else like a neighbor it will make matters worse. Someone was killed in that house superstition or not i would not like to live in a house where something that horrific has happened. Tell her. You shouldn\u2019t even be lying about this at your age. Be a grown man and tell her, why lie to your partner. You don\u2019t have to believe in her beliefs but that doesn\u2019t make them any less valid. And doesn\u2019t excuse you lying to her. Tell her", "YWBTA\n\n\n\nDo I think being superstitious is a bit silly? Yep! Does your wife still have the right to be superstitious? Also yep!\n\n\n\n\nPlus, you're not going to be able to hide this forever. A realtor, a previous owner, a neighbor, random internet searching - there are multiple avenues for your wife to find out the truth and learn you're a liar.", "YTA lol\n\nAnd incredibly disrespectful of her beliefs.", "Imagine if the realtor had kept information from you that ultimately would have changed your mind about wanting the place. Sure, maybe you don\u2019t care about the death but I\u2019m sure there are certain things that if the information was withheld you would be pissed off if you found out after the purchase went through.\n\nThat is the position you are putting your partner through and she should have more trust for you than anyone else in the world.\n\nYTA", "YTA \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd the villain in many a horror film.", "NTA every house that has any age to it is going to have had someone either die in it or have died while living in it.

If there's a moderate or even low chance she'll find out eventually, then YTA. The only thing I'd worry about is the neighbors accidentally spilling the beans sometime down the line. \n\nBut if you're certain she'll remain ignorant, NTA. Either way, go ahead and pretend you never received this information.", "NTA. Absolutely you should not tell her. \n\nDo not give her the opportunity to screw this up over her superstitions.

When she finds out, and she will, she won't just be mad. She'll be trapped. Trapped in a house that no longer feels like home. You'll be the one who trapped her.

So if you don\u2019t tell your SO now, then there will be hell to pay when she finds out - all the more if she finds out that you knew about it beforehand.  If it was me, I wouldn\u2019t have minded if the cause of death was natural causes, but a violent act? Yeah, YTA.", "Sorry but YTA, I am not superstitious at all but if I found that out about a house I was going to buy, I'd not want to purchase either personally. I know you think the house is perfect and perhaps it is for you. To her, it obviously isn't perfect and you know it. It's unfair to withhold something like that, and I agree with others that if she ever found out (which wouldn't be difficult to do), she would lose trust in you, it may even be a deal breaker if she really is as superstitious as you say and you obviously know her very well.\n\nHow long have you been looking for? It can take months to find the right place, or even longer. You can't and shouldn't settle for something like this that one partner is clearly not going to be okay with unless you're absolutely desperate I think. Take your time, find something that both of you are honestly 100% going to be okay with rather than going behind her back on something major.", "Frankly, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s very many dwellings or places on earth where someone hasn\u2019t died in or on it. Does she refuse to enter hospitals, too?", "YTA - I think it will cause problems for you at some point, serious problems so better to just be honest.\nI could see a situation where your S/O tries to sue the real estate company", "But the thing is, since ghosts/spirits don't exist, she would only be uncomfortable if she knew about it and it was on her mind. Everytime the house makes a random noise in the night or something she would think it was haunted, but if she didn't know about the history she wouldn't think twice about any of it.", "Glad I'm not the only one thinking this! A person was murdered in this house.", "OP definitely has a callous vibe.", "I feel like, yeah, the neighbors would spill the beans, or it would come up when she googles the address or something. How about this idea... tell her, and then try to frame it as like, the two of you have the opportunity to karmically clean the house by filling it with love.", "Someone in the neighborhood will tell her, guaranteed, if you move in. Not necessarily to make trouble, but backhandedly, assuming that she already knew. She *will* find out, and she'll blame you for lying by omission. How well would you sleep in that house with that hanging over YOUR head? Haunting.", "Dude. Whether or not ghosts exist, people who you can't control DO exist. And when she's having a perfectly free, open, unsupervised conversation with a neighbor, they're going to mention that someone died there. It's not a matter of if -- it's a matter of when.", "It would still be a lie by omission. She will be upset if she finds out you knew. Take her feelings into consideration. I know the housing market sucks right now but the aftermath of this lie would be horrific. At least tell her and you both can be a part of making the decision.", "That... may actually be a good idea?", "Or you know the ghost will certainly tell her"]}
