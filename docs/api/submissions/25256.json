If you feel like it's not enough,  that's a conversation you need to have with her calmly and respectfully. Talk through options with her.  Based on what you wrote,  all you've done is given ultimatums and yelled at her.", "YTA. Stop worrying about buying a house and rent if you are so miserable.

Since she's doing the childcare, that's an entire unpaid job. And if she went and got a fulltime job, you'd have to pay someone else to do that. You might not get ahead.

I'm also a little confused about your comments on the \"booming economy\", I would hardly say the economy is booming, and depending on the type of business your wifee is running it completely makes sense why they are struggling.

I\u2019m at that age now so that\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards.", "You keep up with your attitude, you won't have a home or a family. It will be all about separation agreements and child support. Is that what you want? To drive away the reasons you are working so hard to accomplish?", "YTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe probably can'tr make more. No use in pressuring her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Who takes care of the daughter? YOU?", "Everybody sucks : you don\u2019t have the right to  tell her and she needs to star to contribute in the financial aspect.", "We can save but I just want to save more. I\u2019m not being realistic here, and I can take full accountability for my actions. Appreciate your comment.", "If your parents are charging you that much you might as well just find an apartment since it would be better for your mental health like you said.", "Lmao you must\u2019ve been an asshole as a kid \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Wow!!!! What are your parents giving you for all that money? I hope you have your own kitchen, bathroom and dining room area too!", "Yeah I\u2019ve been thinking about this lately. Thanks", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Ok well, if you\u2019re helping your mother refinance her own home, and saving money for your home,  and providing for your expenses & those of your family, and your wife is working AND taking care of your child then maybe you could just budget better? \n\nI don\u2019t mean to say you\u2019re an AH, but if I was your wife I wouldn\u2019t be happy you\u2019re asking me to get a better paid job because of these circumstances.", "We plan to sit down at the end of this month and come up with a strict expense sheet to help us save better. I know I\u2019m not an asshole it\u2019s just the stress and added pressure got to me.", "If she is watching your child while you work those two jobs then no wonder she doesn\u2019t have time to put into her business, I\u2019m surprised she is making what she is.  Imagine if you had to take your baby with you to all your jobs.  Would you get much done ?", "OUCH i'd pay that in an apartment to save my mental health.  That's insane", "You can save, or you can pay for her mortgage.   It sounds less she isn't bringing in enough, and more like you're paying your moms bills.  Is 1250 what you'd pay for a room in someone's house in your area?", "bro that\u2019s less than my rent and I live alone making 57k. how are y\u2019all not saving money.", "NTA dude, divorce her. You\u2019re wasting your time. She does not and will not help ever. Her family takes advantage of her.  You already saw you can do better without her.  A marriage is for love, but also a vi tract. She is not fulfilling it and has become a thorn in your foot.", "Yta she already has 2 jobs. Her income job and raising your kid.  How much would day care cost if she magically found a job making more?  How much *more* would be need to earn to make it worth it.  However much daycare costs is part of *her* contribution.\n\nYou also conveniently leave out that you're paying *your* mom $1250 bc *she's* having financial issues.  Why not tell your mom to go get another job? Since, according to you, thats a perfectly fine thing to say.", "I understand you're in a lot of pressure, and you blew, it happens, but if you believe in traditional roles where the man is the leader, see how you can help her find a better job or a second one. Instead of putting pressure on her, hold her hand gently and help her find something else, budget together... Make a plan with her, hear her side (hopefully she's not afraid of you) and lead her. The counselling thing, my bet is that she may feel like you don't listen/understand her or she may not be confident that you're listening to her perspective, so she may want someone to get you to LISTEN to her. Although it may not make sense to you, but I believe you should do it for her and for your relationship. It maybe the best way for her to communicate with you about things that you're overlooking, but a counselor may bring it to your attention. So, don't refuse her that, you may be surprised how important and eye opening it could be.\n\nI pray everything will workout for you.", "YTA\n\nYou gave her 4-8 months to increase her income.  How?  By how much?  It took me almost 2 years to switch jobs for a nice bump in pay and that was while actively looking.  Even yearly Cost-of-Living / promotions generally happen annually if you stay where you are.  At most - she could probably ask for a raise from her father, but you mentioned that she runs it \"with\" him, so she's probably her own boss and could authorize said raise ***if it were feasible***.\n\nTake the counseling.  It's for both of you to take accountability.\n\n\\---\n\nOn another topic - how can you not manage to save money?  This is not really the place for it, but what is your income-to-debt ratio?  Are you focusing on saving money?  You may need to come up with a budgeting plan and I would recommend you do that *before* searching for a house.", "YTA. yelling is not an appropriate way to communicate with your partner, regardless of the stress you're under. Counseling is not \"dodging the issue,\" it's meeting it head on. It sounds like the extra burden you're taking on is untenable for you. With your combined income as it is, whether you're living in an apartment or with your parents, you should be able to save plenty of money. If you're unhappy with the work load you're under, I suggest you reduce your hours to something manageable for you, adjust your timetable for buying your first home, and cut down on spending, rather than expecting your partner to take on the same load that has left you feeling this unhappy.", "Rent in my area is 2200+ for a 1 bedroom. We need at least 2 bedrooms and a den. That\u2019s 3k per month roughly. She does need help, it\u2019s my mother. I\u2019d rather put money in her pocket than rent from a stranger. \n\nWhere did you read that I told my partner to get another job? I just said I asked her to bump up her income. Whether that means she brings it in through her business or maybe we work on some contract work on the side together, but I didn\u2019t say I told her to get another job.", "> She doesn\u2019t majority of the childcare.\n\nJust FYI, as someone who's been a stay-at-home parent, childcare is a full-time job. \n\nI don't know your daughter's age, but when my kids were little I was pulling 80-hour weeks at home, unpaid. That included dishes, laundry, cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, financial management, and errands for a family of 4. \n\nIt's exhausting. Granted, we had several toddlers (school age kids are easier), but if she's taking care of your daughter AND working, that deserves a hell of a lot more recognition.", "You need to move out now!", "And how does one magically bump up an income?  If you have a way, I'd love to do it!  Working on 'some contract work' with or without you, *is* another job. Bumping up her income, barring that magical method, means getting another job.\n\n\n It doesn't sound like she's sitting around eating bon bons.  She's working a full time for her dad (even if she's taking a lower wage, then she's helping her dad just like you're helping your mom), doing the majority of childcare and I bet if we asked *her* the majority of housework.  All while living with her inlaw. Joy.", "You pay her parents $1,250?!?  Jesus, you\u2019re paying their mortgage.", "I appreciate your insight but you sound like a moron.", "*His parents but I agree.", "Counseling would benefit you both, but she also should attend so as to better help you manage stress. \n\nMy ex-husband used to yell a lot, and I told him that yelling at me won't solve any problems he or we as a couple have, but it would make it much worse.\n\nI think you and she need to sit down and use the \"I feel (insert feeling(s)) and this is why\" statements so you are taking responsibility for your feelings and if she can do the same, she would taking responsibility for her feelings. \n\nI learned a long time ago that it's not what you say but how you say it that makes a huge difference.", " Q I palpably wait aq no pq n qp pq\nA A a a q", "Thanks brother", "Right it kind of seems like he\u2019s taking his stress out on her but I bet he preaches to be the man of the house and for her to clean and cook and look after the kids but wants 50-50 financial stability but doesn\u2019t think about what she does because \u201cparenting and staying at home isn\u2019t a job\u201d", "It all depends on where OP is and what the current rental and housing market is. That's less than half my mortgage. And in the city I live in, $1250 a month would barely cover a room in a shared house to rent, for a 1 bedroom it is usually $1800-2200/month or more.", "I am assuming since the parents are elderly so they would have some equity and house ownership history under their belts to allow for smaller mortgage payments, but they could have a higher cost, yes."]}
