You were in the right to stop this.", "NTA it is a well known dinner party rule to avoid conversation focused on religion, politics, and money. \nIn polite company guests should take the hint to change conversation and not need it to be brought to a shuddering halt.\nBearing all of that in mind, it's ok to have a heated debate without having to tell people to leave.", "NTA. It reads as though you handled it as well as you could have.", "NTA.  Back when I hosted dinners/events, I experienced so many of similar events that, finally, I created a similar rule.  \n\nIt was rude of your guests to force everyone else around them to witness and increasingly loud and raucous debate.  They left, fine.  I hope that you enjoyed the rest of your evening.", ">'Enough, no politics or religion here tonight please, it's my home, my rules for the evening.'\n\nThe issue with this statement is, the current issue you dubbed 'no politics no religion' has moved the incredibly lazy and apathetic politically and religiously British public to march in greater numbers then they did when protesting the UK's invasion of Iraq. Like in the past decade our government has done horrible things from selling off the NHS, deporting retired elderly people who worked in the NHS, left the EU, threw sewage in our seas, and the UK didn't protest in as large numbers as you're seeing now.\n\nAnd what's got the British public moved enough to march is that hospitals and refugee camps have been bombed, killing generations of families down to the newborns. This isn't a topic where you can calmly say, \"I have no opinion, agree to disagree, change the topic, the weather aye? more prosecco\". Not taking a side is worse than passionately supporting the current genocide. That's why all your friends turned on you.

Don't have these losers back into your home until there is peace in the middle east. IOW, never.", "NTA, but also, considering this conflict, I\u2019d understand not being supportive of a friend who had vastly different view of it (if someone sees this as a genocide, I would understand not being accepting of someone who excuses the murder of a population for example). \n\n\nIf tomorrow some of my friends were to say the kkk is a valid group who does good things, I\u2019ll be the first one to fight it off, even if we\u2019re having a chill party. \nThis is the kind of thing where you learn the values of your friends and then that\u2019s your call to see if you can look past those values or not. I don\u2019t think your friends were TA either for voicing opinions are important to them and represent their values.", "Free speech comes directly from sophists and the whole concept of democracy. Without democracy, free speech could mean anything (how some people claim they can insult others and it\u2019s free speech). The term is part of the concept of democracy as an open \u201cfree\u201d exchange of ideas. The opposite of hurling insults. NTA", "I think \u201cNo politics\u201d rules anywhere are misleading, because deciding what is and isn\u2019t political/up for debate IS a political opinion and wanting to remain neutral is too, so it makes sense both of your friends were upset that you disagreed with them about this topic. \n\nNTA though for not wanting to hear that conversation during dinner and it sounds like it was a lot of personal attacks and you can\u2019t have any conversation like that", "Overall NTA, from what you have written it seems like no-politics-or-religion talk isn't really what you were going for and asking for a respectful debate was probably what you should have said first. Though I can't really fault you for that, when tensions are high people don't often word things in the best way. \n\nI think the whole free speech vs no hate speech thing is, ideologically, quite a hard line to balance sometimes but I think in practice allowing hateful ideas to be shared doesn't lead to respectful discussions. (You have not given context for what you are talking about so that may be taking things to the extremes.) \n\nKeeping conversations civil among friends is important, if people can't do that then yeah, as the host you have to step in. It's not really fair to your other guests. I think that picking a side would have just exacerbated the situation and often there is no clear right or wrong its is just based on someone's person views/life experience. \n\nIt may be worth sending a message to the group apologising for the situation getting out of hand, that you appreciate that you all can have differing opinions and still remain friends. Try to be diplomatic and assume that they will all be the bigger person and hope peer pressure smooths the situation over. \"Isn't it great that we can have differing opinions and still respect each other\" puts pressure on the person to agree and implies the situation is already respolved. But \"I want us to move past this, I hope we can move on from the hurtful things said\" opens the conversation up to rehashing the argument and more disagreements.", "NTA. The shit show of the world doesn\u2019t need to bleed into every aspect of your life.", "NTA those two topics are guaranteed to bring the WWE Smackdown into your home.", "NTA - my husband and I love a good debate but not in a million years do I want to have that one in my house at a dinner party. \nThere are no \u2018winners\u2019 or even moral \u2018winners\u2019 both sides have atrocities attached. \n\nYou did the smartest thing possible and shut it down.", "I tell people up front, before they even get to my house, that politics and religion belong on the porch.

I don't have these things happen because I don't make friends with bigots.", "YTA", "NTA\n\nSome topics are polarising in any event although sensible, sober heads can discuss the issues when so desired. However, add alcohol to the mix and it's very easy to go from discussion to insult and abuse. Sometimes you need to know when to call time.
