It\u2019s not a destination wedding but I do have to travel a few hours out of town for it and will be staying at a motel for a few days in her city. The wedding is on a Saturday. I am not part of the wedding party but the overall gathering is on the small side and largely unstaffed so I\u2019m volunteering to help cleanup afterwards the next day. Because it\u2019s a smaller event with mostly just her close friends and family who all live nearby (I\u2019m the furthest away), she sent out her save the date just recently and I got mine in the mail last week. I have RVSPd.\n\nThe problem is my other friend (27F) \u201cBea\u201d whose daughter\u2019s first birthday is that same weekend, the Sunday, when I will still be out of town (I\u2019m be there until Monday). She lives in my current town. Bea is hosting a big event for this party, it\u2019s at an expensive venue and apparently catered. Therefore she also sent out RVSPs, which I received before Alina\u2019s but hadn\u2019t responded to yet.\n\nObviously I\u2019m choosing Alina\u2019s wedding, which she will remember for the rest of her life, over a birthday party for a baby who won\u2019t even be old enough to realize it\u2019s happening. Bea is furious about this however because I\u2019m \u201cchoosing a grown woman over her baby\u201d and she asked me first etc. She accused me of not caring about her or her daughter because I didn\u2019t respond to her RVSP even before I knew Alina\u2019s was coming (but months in advance for a baby\u2019s first birthday\u2026? Like is that really unusual?) Bea then started demanding I leave immediately after the wedding or the next morning so I can make it to both events and be \u201cfair\u201d but I\u2019ve already promised Alina and her family my help for cleanup and tbh\u2026 it just seems like something I\u2019d rather do. I\u2019ve never been one for swanky high end parties, even weddings for that matter, but helping a lifelong friend revel in her joy is something I don\u2019t want to miss.\n\nNow Bea and all of our mutual friends are calling me selfish and making me feel really awful for my choice. There\u2019s still time to change my mind I guess and I\u2019m not sure what to do now. I haven\u2019t told Alina because she\u2019s already dealing with so much wedding stress and this doesn\u2019t seem like a \u201cher\u201d problem to manage.

There seems to be a lot of teeth gnashing about you missing someone else's kid's birthday.", "NTA - but I'm going softer on Bea than other posters have. Mostly because of the flaw in your reasoning - a baby won't remember this event. But her mom sure will! Celebrating her daughter's first birthday with you is more about celebrating her as a mom, and I'm sure she'd love to have you there, and yeah, she's definitely going to remember it for a lifetime.  I agree that the wedding is more important, but I can understand Bea feeling hurt.", "INFO. So, did you basically tell Bea, hey I can\u2019t go because I JUST got this other invitation so now I have a conflict?", "ESH I think part of the reason Bea feels so insulted is because you left her on read for months but the moment you got the wedding invite you said yes immeadiatly i can kinda see how that would rub someone the wrong way.", "YTA but not by much.  Bea did invite you first and that should mean something but so do your wants and needs.   She also offered a compromise, though rudely it sounds like, and you rejected that as well.  I would tell her that if she apologizes for going off that you\u2019d be happy to head to the birthday party after the wedding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
