We met through mutual friends and hit it off rather quickly.  After a year of knowing each other we started dating. Derek firmly believes that everyone deserves a second chance and to let bygones be bygones. I adore him for being a good hearted person but also feel pressured to forgive people like how he does.\n\nI was never close with my parents due to the fact I was an oopies baby and my parents decided to keep me. It was made clear I was an outsider and didnt belong. They already had their dream family but I was just there to ruin it. My mom would comment on my weight and my sister started doing it too. My dad would ignore me and my brother would bully me to the point I felt scared to leave my room. They would leave me at my grandparents house when they went on vacation and wouldn't pick me up until 2 weeks after they came back. Once I turned 18, they kicked me out and we've been low contact ever since.\n\nMy boyfriend asked about meeting my family so I explained my childhood which was a hard conversation to have since I wanted to forget about them. He comforted me while I cried on his shoulder and he seemly understood. I thought that was final until 4 months go by and he randomly asks me to go on a date with him to this fancy restaurant. I was honestly so excited since it's been awhile since we went on a date  so I quickly got dressed. We arrived to dinner place at 8 pm and was seated at a party size table. I was a little confused but brushed it off . That\u2019s until I saw my parents and siblings walk in thats when I knew something was definitely off. They came to the table we were at and said hello to us. Turns out my boyfriend was secretly communicating to them trying to heal the past and fix our relationship.\n\nI felt so uncomfortable that I quickly got up and walked out. My boyfriend followed along and told me to come back inside, How I should let bygones be bygones. In a fit of rage I told him off and how it wasnt his place to fix a relationship that isnt his to fix.I stormed off to the car and drove off. Him and my parents were blowing up my phone calling me childish and unreasonable. I ended up turning off my phone and packing my things to stay with a friend. I told another friend of mines about the situation and they said I was extremely childish. Now im thinking if I was in the right or wrong for leaving.

FUCKING. SHIT.\n\nNot only did he go BEHIND YOUR BACK to talk to people you\u2019ve decided are not worth being in your life ABOUT YOU but then he blindsided you with a confrontation you didn\u2019t want nor agree to. \n\nHe\u2019s not just the AH, he clearly has no respect for you or your feelings. Cut contact ASAP.", "NTA! NTA! NTA!\n\nThis was a great violation of your trust!\n\nCut ties with your boyfriend *immediately!* Frankly, his actions seem rather hateful.\n\nAlso, cut ties with people (friends) saying you are being \"childish.\"\n\nYou are clearly suffering trauma. You don't say if you have had therapy for this; it would be a good idea. That's where you deal with this kind of thing. Not with your BF throwing you into the arena. You were right, it isn't his business to fix your relationship w/your family.\n\nYou are the only one who can decide if you want yr family in your life or not. Some people do forgive their families for past events, but nonetheless decided they don't want them in their life. \n\nYou are not wrong in walking out. And again, I recommend therapy if you're not already seeing someone.", "NTA not even a little bit. \n\nHe should be begging forgiveness for making such a horrifying, boundary crossing mistake. \n\nYikes.", "NTA he's fucking way out of line and owes you a massive apology. Assuming you don't dump him", "NTA \u2014 but your ex and your friends are", "NTA \n\nThat was a gross breach of trust from him. I don\u2019t know why some people feel the need to force mending relationships with toxic family.\n\nYou weren\u2019t being childish, you were enforcing a boundary that he deliberately stomped all over.", "NTA. He may have meant well but it wasn\u2019t his place to do this. You can forgive people and still refuse a relationship with them. Not saying you have to forgive them for treating you so badly but if you ever decided to, you still don\u2019t have to see them. This was a huge overstep by boyfriend. He either thinks he knows better than you or he truly hasn\u2019t experienced any sort of neglect or abuse (and good for him) and cannot comprehend how awful this was. Either way I would be very interested in how he responds to this giant error in judgment and you have every right to not forgive him either", "NTA - Even if it wasn't his intention, he minimized your trauma and basically ambushed you in a public space with the very people who caused your trauma. The fact that he then doubled down upon seeing your reaction, instead of immediately apologizing and leaving with you, is a huge red flag. The fact he then called you names after you left should tell you everything you need to know about him, and how a relationship with him will work going forward. I would be doing some serious thinking on if staying in this relationship is worth the potential additional trauma if I were in your shoes.", "You are NTA! Your (hopefully soon to be ex) boyfriend, after listening to your cries, went behind your back and obliterated your boundaries with an intervention-type meeting with the people who abused and neglected you. \n\nHe could have asked you if you wanted to heal the relationship. He could have suggested you meet them. He could have done a whole host of other things to determine if you wanted help in this regard. \n\nHe did none of those things. He just decided that you NEEDED to 'heal' the relationship and also decided HOW you were to do it. All without any input. \n\nAgain, you are NTA! And you are not childish!", "NTA. You should ghost him and your family. Block and go completely silent.", "NTA. Break up with him now and cut off the friend that said you were childish. You clearly went through a great deal of trauma from what you\u2019ve said about your childhood and it\u2019s your decision as to whether you want contact with your family or not. What your boyfriend did goes beyond being disrespectful. I\u2019m so sorry, OP. That must have felt like a massive betrayal and brought up a lot of bad memories.", "NTA\n\nYour bf needs to stay in his own lane.", "Oh honey.  I am so so sorry.  NTA.  I'd be moving on without him.  That'll be a deal breaker for me.", "NTA - man trying to control you. It's not his place to try to mend and totally disrespectful to you and your feelings. Red flag if there ever was one.", "Wow. Maybe he\u2019s stupid. Maybe he lacks emotional maturity. Maybe he has no understanding of how abusive relationships work.\n\nOr, maybe he really likes white-knighting, being the \u201cnice guy\u201d who\u2019s going to fix something he has no understanding of and is not his business.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, his self-importance is a bigger priority for him than your well-being. You deserve better. NTA.", "\"First off, calling years worth of abuse and neglect 'bygones' is insulting: we didn't have a disagreement, they seriously and profoundly wronged me and have never apologized nor shown remorse for their actions. Second, what you did is a gross violation of the trust I placed in you: I shared a deeply painful chapter of my life with you, and you used that information to secretly connect with the unrepentant people who harmed me. You know how I *know* that they are unrepentant? Because if they felt bad about their actions, the guilt would be eating them up and they would have contacted me to at least *try* to apologize or make it up to me. And finally, this shows massive disrespect towards me as a person. If you had any modicum of respect for me, you would have talked to me about it and tried to convince me, not blindsided me in an obvious attempt to just pressure me into capitulating.\"\n\nNTA. The fact that his parents think that they get to harass you for walking out on their son's awful decision is further proof that this is a toxic situation. They don't believe that you have the right to reject their son. That's scary, and may have contributed to his sense of entitlement that allowed him to force you into an unwanted and (at least emotionally) unsafe situation.\n\nI don't know what is wrong with your \"friend\"...I can only tell you that some people are truly naive and don't necessarily realize how deeply wrong your ex's actions were", "Holy shit, NTA. He was completely out of line blindsiding you like that, especially after you confided in him and he saw how emotional it made you. I came from a broken home and do not speak to my father. If a partner did this it would be a break up on the spot, personally.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry your (hopefully ex) boyfriend is a selfish trash bag.", "NTA. People who didn\u2019t have bad parents don\u2019t understand how deep the psychological damage goes. \n\nHe probably meant well, but he needs to understand how stupid it was to ambush you with your estranged family in a public setting. Like, I can\u2019t even begin to count the number of ways that\u2019s messed up.\n\nI\u2019d probably give him one last chance, but he\u2019s going to have to do some serious groveling. If he continues to downplay how harmful this misguided attempt at a family reunion is to you (or worse, tries to ambush you again), he needs to go.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is either extremely na\u00efve or completely out to lunch. You do not throw a victim of psychological abuse back into the path of their abusers without their explicit prior knowledge **and** consent. \n\nPlease, if you intend to stay in the relationship with him, get relationship counselling, and fast. He needs to have a counsellor explain to him in detail why this was breathtakingly stupid, inconsiderate, and psychologically harmful for you so that he will never undertake such a horrific fool\u2019s errand ever again.", "NTA, but YWBTA if you don\u2019t dump the boyfriend for failing to respect boundaries and go NC with your blood relatives for emotional abuse and neglect.", "NTA, if you still want to be with your BF. Establish your boundaries and set ground rules. If he doesn't want to follow, abide by them, then dump him. \n\nAgain, NTA, the way he went about setting all that up after you opened up to him. He is very naive, or it's simply the way he was raised and has the family is all logic.", "Oh lord, I'm so sorry OP that your boyfriend did this. NTA in anyway shape or form. It is definitely easy for those who have not experienced trauma or neglect to say forgive and forget but it is not their choice to make. BF is a huge ah, what he did was condescending, rude, manipulative and controlling. You told him why you have limited contact with your family and he took it upon himself to play white knight and fix it because he believes he should. He breached your trust here in a very big way and to be honest I don't know that it is at all repairable because he doesn't see that his actions truly are unforgivable for blindsiding you and trying to force you to relive your trauma in public with the very people who caused that trauma. Your friend isn't much better. You and only you, get to decide when and if you want to repair these relationships. You get to decide what your boundaries are and how to enforce them. Seriously, I'm outraged for you here.\n\nEdited for spelling.", "Wholy shit I skimmed this and I thought this guys a piece of work cut contact with everyone", "NTA - bf is a whole red flag. Bygones be bygones is just another way to gloss over problems and invalidate feelings. Yeah, get out.", "NTA. People need to respect boundaries and that\u2019s it.", "NTA\n\nNot only has he brought your abusers back in your life against you very clearly expressed will, he has now joined in with your abusers in harassing & blaming you for your abuse, invalidating your feelings, & they are all actively disrespecting & bullying you. Block them all. Not one of them deserves a 2nd chance. Not your family or your boyfriend.", "NTA. These people abused you. They discarded you. They don\u2019t get a second chance.\n\nYour bf has a savior complex. He always want\nTo save the day. This isn\u2019t a situation he can save or should save.\n\nHe should be furious of the trauma they caused you not welcoming them into your life now.", "NTA. You told him your boundaries and exposed your trauma. He decided that he knew better than you did about YOUR situation and betrayed you. This says he doesn't respect your decisions, that he thinks he has the right to bypass your boundaries if he doesn't agree with them, and that he's a lying sneaky bastard.\n\n\nThis is not forgiveable. And you will never be able to trust him again. Keep walking.", "The whole lot of them are AH.  What did he think they would do, get on their knees and beg forgiveness.  They were there for a free fancy dinner.  Dump the MF AH for doing this.  You are so much better than this.", "NTA... Drop the ass and I mean now.

I would probably be even more pissed at how OP, who they willingly brought into this world, they liked it or not, was treated throughout her childhood. \n\nGood on OP for walking out of that disastrous dinner attempt. NTA.", "My sister in law was like that. She grew up in a loving family who often had foster kids in the home, most still are family after they aged out. She scolded us for going NC with my mom because she couldn\u2019t fathom the impacts her crazy had on us (she was an unmediated paranoid schizophrenic) growing up. She invited my mom in and all we could do was watch the inevitable train wreck in slow motion. NOW she understands NC", "I think you need to read it again", "Your parents are pathetic awful excuses for human beings.  I\u2019m so sorry for what happened to you during your childhood, and I can\u2019t believe your parents have not even recognized the harm they did to you.  Even your siblings should be able to see how the parents treated you, and none of your family should have gone along with your ass boyfriends ambush.  If they wanted to make amends they should have reached out on their own, privately, and not in a public setting", "That was what i was afraid of listening, so gross, im really sorry and just want to let you know that your feelings are totally valid to feel that way. Just horrible.", "Damn! Even if he had good intentions the fact he  couldn\u2019t recognize your pain is disconcerting. Best of luck. Chin up!", "info: what has he been texting you? and what have your parents been saying to him?", "Oh wow. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m also sorry your BF sucks for trying to have such awful, garbage people in your life.", "Exactly. This is a set up in more ways than one. \"Surely you can forgive me for cheating/abusing you, you forgave your parents. Bygones and such.\"", "this is MASSIVE. this man acted like he understood OP\u2019s trauma, went behind her back to contact her family, lied to her about the orchestrated dinner he put together by saying it was a \u201cdate,\u201d & then when she walked out he told her to \u201clet bygones be bygones\u201d when OP was neglected & abused. this sub is very quick to jump to breaking up, but this situation more than warrants it", "He called years of neglect, bygones. He decided for her that she should fix her situation with her parents. He knew she would never agree to meet with her parents so he tricked her into going. This was all planned. this wasnt a fuck up, it was intentional.", ">If he can understand this, apologize and take the steps to make it right, then surely go from there? She hasn't suggested there are other issues\n\nbut he doesnt since he thinks her treatment is just a bygone", "Even if it's a little misunderstanding, making amends isn't up to the bf. Ever. \n\nActually bf sounds like a classic enabler who needs to fix everything. If OP decides to stick with him, it's time for him to come clean on what happened in his life to make him this way.", "Agreed. I was just responding to how it is difficult for someone (like me) from a fairly happy family to understand this in case of misunderstandings. I probably would still never surprise someone with an ambush like this. But I may have asked them what can be done for there to be a chance of reconciliation. \n\nA lot of time on reddit has definitely helped me understand better how that would not be as good an idea as I would have thought earlier."]}
