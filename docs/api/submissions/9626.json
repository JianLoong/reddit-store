He would play it constantly and I thought that it was just because it was new and it would die down. It\u2019s been over two months now and he is playing it more than ever. Like 8-12 hours a day. Sometimes I will get home from work around 4:30 pm and he will still be asleep, and when I wake him up he goes straight to his PS5. He used to be employed but he is not currently and I was understanding and tried to help him find a job, but he started taking advantage of the fact that I wouldn\u2019t push him to get a job because I thought a grown man could figure that out. I understand needing your own time but we don\u2019t really talk as much at all anymore and I have sat down with him and told him on several different occasions that I don\u2019t like how much time he is spending on the PS5, and that I want him looking for a job. At first he would respond with \u201cok I will I\u2019m sorry\u201d but now he groans and ignores me and the only time he talks is if I\u2019m watching him play a game. We\u2019re still sleeping in the same room but he comes in to sleep at around 3-4 in the morning and I wake up every day at 6 am. So it really doesn\u2019t feel like it. Then on Wednesday, I reminded my boyfriend that my cousin\u2019s wedding was tomorrow (yesterday) and told him I have an outfit picked out for him. I had gotten up at my usual time and did some routinely things before I got dressed and woke him up around noon. Just to make sure he was up I watched him get up. I told him to take a shower in the other bathroom so I can do my makeup. When I was finished with my makeup, he\u2019s on the PS5. I was extremely furious. I unplugged it and put it in my car. I said to him that he can get this back when we are home from the wedding. He obliged. Then about an hour into the wedding I had been talking to a couple who wanted to buy a house. Me being a real estate agent, was doing what I always do in this situation which is just a lot of sweet talking. My boyfriend walked over and I introduced him and said \u201coh! This is my boyfrien-\u201c I was interrupted by him saying \u201ccan you give me my ps5 now\u201d I was mortified to say the least and told the couple to excuse us. I say to him \u201cyou want the PS5 so bad? Fine. I will drop you off, then coming back.\u201d When we get home he gets out the car and I drive off with the PS5. I was just so pissed off that that was the reason I had left the wedding that I didn\u2019t care. We share a car so he doesn\u2019t have another. I hadn\u2019t responded to any calls or texts from him until I got home because I just wanted for a couple of hours to not have my relationship be fixated on a PS5. I came back late that night and I apologized to him but I told him I\u2019m not giving it back until he finds a job because it is ruining our relationship. He cried and I started to feel bad and I\u2019m debating whether I was being too controlling.

To be this dependent on a console that you want to leave a wedding to play is ALARMING.\n\nIf you love him, then you need to come from a concerned angle and not judgemental. He needs to either open up to you or a therapist. He also needs to see his general practitioner to see if he is clinically depressed or has another underlying issue. He needs to understand that he needs help and your willing to love and support him through the process of getting help.\n\nWhat are activities you used to do together before the PS5?
