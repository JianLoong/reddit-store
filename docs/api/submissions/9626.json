He would play it constantly and I thought that it was just because it was new and it would die down. It\u2019s been over two months now and he is playing it more than ever. Like 8-12 hours a day. Sometimes I will get home from work around 4:30 pm and he will still be asleep, and when I wake him up he goes straight to his PS5. He used to be employed but he is not currently and I was understanding and tried to help him find a job, but he started taking advantage of the fact that I wouldn\u2019t push him to get a job because I thought a grown man could figure that out. I understand needing your own time but we don\u2019t really talk as much at all anymore and I have sat down with him and told him on several different occasions that I don\u2019t like how much time he is spending on the PS5, and that I want him looking for a job. At first he would respond with \u201cok I will I\u2019m sorry\u201d but now he groans and ignores me and the only time he talks is if I\u2019m watching him play a game. We\u2019re still sleeping in the same room but he comes in to sleep at around 3-4 in the morning and I wake up every day at 6 am. So it really doesn\u2019t feel like it. Then on Wednesday, I reminded my boyfriend that my cousin\u2019s wedding was tomorrow (yesterday) and told him I have an outfit picked out for him. I had gotten up at my usual time and did some routinely things before I got dressed and woke him up around noon. Just to make sure he was up I watched him get up. I told him to take a shower in the other bathroom so I can do my makeup. When I was finished with my makeup, he\u2019s on the PS5. I was extremely furious. I unplugged it and put it in my car. I said to him that he can get this back when we are home from the wedding. He obliged. Then about an hour into the wedding I had been talking to a couple who wanted to buy a house. Me being a real estate agent, was doing what I always do in this situation which is just a lot of sweet talking. My boyfriend walked over and I introduced him and said \u201coh! This is my boyfrien-\u201c I was interrupted by him saying \u201ccan you give me my ps5 now\u201d I was mortified to say the least and told the couple to excuse us. I say to him \u201cyou want the PS5 so bad? Fine. I will drop you off, then coming back.\u201d When we get home he gets out the car and I drive off with the PS5. I was just so pissed off that that was the reason I had left the wedding that I didn\u2019t care. We share a car so he doesn\u2019t have another. I hadn\u2019t responded to any calls or texts from him until I got home because I just wanted for a couple of hours to not have my relationship be fixated on a PS5. I came back late that night and I apologized to him but I told him I\u2019m not giving it back until he finds a job because it is ruining our relationship. He cried and I started to feel bad and I\u2019m debating whether I was being too controlling.
