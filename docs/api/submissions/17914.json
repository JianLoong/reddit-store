You weren't comfortable and you discretely asked for another seat.  She's an AH for saying that drivel.\n\nThe biggest AH is airlines for making seats smaller for the past 20+ years.  It sucks now compared to when I flew in the 90s.", "NTA.  I'm not plus sized, I'm fat.  So maybe I shouldn't be speaking for plus-sized people, but speaking as a fat person, if you were sitting next to me, I would be very happy that a solution was found that made everyone more comfortable.  I'm very aware of when my fatness is invading another person's space and I am more embarrassed by that.  You talked to the attendant quietly.  It's not like you stood up and started shouting and calling them pigs or anything like that.  What you did was find a solution that allowed everyone to sit comfortably and maintain dignity.  Again, NTA", "I am sure *everybody* was more comfortable with you moving and making that middle seat empty. \n\nIt sounds like you were as discrete as anybody could be. You should have said \u201cI moved and gave you more room. *You are welcome\u201d.* And walked away. \n\nNTA those seats *are* terribly small.", "NTA. Her anger is misdirected. She can go ahead and be mad at the airlines for not accommodating people of her size, but it's a perfectly normal human response not to want to be touching someone you don't know and to take steps to make that not happen.", "This wasn't you fat shaming. This was you looking for comfort. Her feeling uncomfortable was her problem not yours. You didn't publicly shame her. You handled the situation extremely well. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all.  You gave it a try, it did not work out, you moved.  That woman who confronted you had a chip on her shoulder and is an AH.  As for others witnessing what happened, NO ONE WILL CARE/REMEMBER.", "NTA - I\u2019m a plus sized person and I wouldn\u2019t have been offended. Why should I make it uncomfortable for other people when there are other seats. That person has their own issues", "NTA and I'm fat. \n\nThe best answer would have been to say \"these seats/airlines are really fat phobic and designed to make us uncomfortable, so I figured if there was a way to give you more space it was the kinder thing to do.\" But also, don't stress this.", "America makes larger everything now. I\u2019m a nurse, and we have bariatric beds, chairs, wheelchairs. Car manufacturers are now mostly marking SUVs and vans for the sole purpose of more space for our \u201cgrowing\u201d population. The only industry who hasn\u2019t caught up with this is the airline industry. It get it, they can\u2019t maximize profits with larger seats. You can only make planes so big. \n\nNeither of these things are your problem, though. Plane tickets are expensive, and they\u2019re not getting cheaper. You paid for your ticket, as did they. That doesn\u2019t entitle them to whine when the size of their bodies interferes with your comfort and you request to move because they\u2019re invading your space, however unintentionally. You didn\u2019t fat shame anyone, and the woman\u2019s own issues with her body type were being projected onto you. That\u2019s not your problem either, it\u2019s hers.", "NTA, you handled it correctly. Hell I've done that on long flights just so I didn't have to sit between 2 people.", "NTA.

Sounds like you tried your best NOT to embarrass her.", "NTA\n\nYou were discrete when moving.

She is pissy that you sought other seating arrangements bc her body was literally spilling into your seat and resting on top of you.  What buillshit.\n\nYou did the right thing by moving.  You bought a seat on a flight and she doesnt get to invade your area.  NTA", "NTA you were physically uncomfortable in your seat, because of the other passengers.

Why be uncomfortable for hours on end if you don\u2019t have to?

She's the one who is embarrassing herself by calling her and the man flat out fat. All you did was get up and move for comfort not only to yourself but to them as well. \n\nNTA. You didn't call them fat, you didn't insinuate they are fat, all you did was get up and move.", "No. All passengers are renting space. If they can\u2019t fit in their rented space, they are \u2018stealing\u2019 your space. \n\nAt some point, a very large person would need to buy a second seat. You are not shaming them. You simply wanted the (not very to begin with) comfortable space you paid for. \n\nNTA", "NTA - you quietly asked the flight attendant if you could move as it was severely uncomfortable and they moved you.  \n\nSeems like a super reasonable moment.  \n\nI was once across the aisle from someone that smelled horrible- the lady next to him fought it out for a bit but couldn't take it. So she asked politely to move and got a new seat.   \n\nSomeone waiting for you off the plane feels super aggressive! People are crazy", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m happy you did what was best for you! You PAID for that seat and YOU should be comfortable.", "NTA\n\nYou're not treating fatness as a contagion.\n\nFat people on an airplane are indeed an inconvenience when their fat impinges on your seat. The problem here was that your neighbor's body didn't fit within the confines of her own seat. I'd have thought that it would have been uncomfortable for your neighbor to have to be pressed up against you, and your neighbor would also have been better off after you moved to another seat.", "NTA.  Don't let anyone tell you differently.", "NTA, you didn't make a scene and they found you a more workable seat. It's a shame air travel is so intrinsically cruel to larger folks, but I don't see how you could've done anything better yourself.", "Seems like she is insecure about herself and looking to blame someone for her life choices. I would have told her to mind her business and walked away. \n\nPeople get too easily offended these days and it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s job to cater to them. You did the right thing and you\u2019re definitely not TAH but she is.", "NTA.\n\nFat lady here; that was the most thoughtful thing for you to do in that situation.\n\nIt *definitely* contributed to everyone's comfort.\n\nYou're just getting splashback from her own sense of shame/tiredness/discomfort etc. It's awfully uncomfortable to travel while fat, I end up a jumble of nerves just due to anticipating assholes and awkward situations. That's not your responsibility or anyone else's.", "Im a passenger of size. Let me tell you. It ain\u2019t easy. But you handled that as diplomatically and compassionately as you could have. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. None of what you did was a public demonstration, you asked the flight attendant privately.", "Personally, I'd say NTA. Though, I would have grabbed my carry-on before getting up to ask the flight attendant if I could move, just so you didn't have to go back to that seat again and make it awkward. You weren't fat-shaming or anything, you were just really uncomfortable in that seat and wanted to move. You didn't make any comment about weight to them or anything, that was an assumption on her part. If she asked, you could've just said that you were uncomfortable in that seat and wanted to move, no further explanation needed. That lady frankly sounds insecure in her weight and decided to take out some pent up anger on you.\n\nYou didn't ask, get a no, and make a scene. I'm sure if you were told there were no other seat, you would've went back to your seat quietly and not said another word.", "NTA and you should have replied back saying 'I couldn't breathe'. You didn't cause a drama and you did what anyone else would do. Why should you suffer because some entitled lady could feel better at herself? Do not give in to these sort of people as they can book themselves a business class seat if they want to save the embarrassment or maybe take a coach.", "NTA", "Nta. You made your request quietly and discreetly. There are a thousand reasons somebody might want/need to move seats on an aeroplane and many of them have nothing to do with the seat neighbours.\n\nYou didn't shout across the plane \"hey, can I move seats because my neighbours are crushing me due to their size\" or anything like that (which would have made you TA)", "NTA, as a tall curvy woman (I fit in airplane seats, but not much wiggle room)  I would have been ecstatic to have the middle person take another seat to give everyone more room! You did it in a gentle and respectful way. The woman has issues.", "NTA I am plus sized, not enough to hang out of my airplane seat, but I fit in them rather snugly. Nobody wants their personal space invaded by others, on a plane though, it's a matter of fact that it's going to happen. But when a person's FLESH is RESTING ON YOUR BODY, that is downright uncomfortable. I feel like you were as tactful and unobtrusive about it as you could possibly be. It's not like you started a scene when your row companions took their seats, you gave it a go and waited until you could be as discreet as possible. I'd think THEY BOTH would have been GRATEFUL for the extra room you afforded them by moving... My daughter is obese from health issues the past 7 years and she literally buys TWO SEATS on domestic flights because she IS that big. She would not have been offended, but she rarely has any fucks to give in general...but yeah...you did the best you could and handled it as well as could be expected. Don't let one person's pettiness cause you any more concern, \"she ain't payin' rent, so kick her right outta your head\".", "NTA You handled the situation as privately and gently as possible. Some people are just incredibly sensitive about their size. She really had no right to confront you or speak for the other guy. You're supposed to just silently suffer? It's totally unfair.", "NTA. You did both seatmates a favor by giving them more room. so they were more comfortable. You we're the only one who benefitted from your decision.", "NTA \n\nI would be really uncomfortable to be sitting next to a stranger and being so close that we're touching, regardless of their size. \n\nI don't feel like she should have approached you and yelled at you, but I can understand where she is coming from because fat people are discriminated against.  She was probably feeling humiliated and her brain weasels were probably telling her that \"everyone on the plane saw this and now they're all laughing at me behind my back\".", "NTA - They were invading your personal space. Something that they couldn\u2019t do anything about due to the design of the airplane. You didn\u2019t insult them, or ask them to make some adjustment that was physically impossible for them to do. You walked up to the flight attendant and made your discomfort known. You didn\u2019t even talk about the issue in their presence!\n\nThat woman was an asshole! From the description of how the seat fails to accommodate her without taking up some other person\u2019s space she should have booked enough space for herself. OR expect the person who\u2019s space she is invading to do something about it to try to make themselves Comfortable. Because unfortunately airlines have tiny ass seats to save cost.", "I'd say NTA (might lean towards NAH). You did what you did to make yourself comfortable and clearly it was possible as it happened. I'm assuming she (and the other guy) were also more comfortable having enough space, so in that view it was a win for everyone.\n\nThe real assholes are uncomfortable small aeroplane seats.", "NTA. You paid for your ticket the same as they did. Why should you be forced to suffer just because they lack consideration and self-awareness? You paid for a full seat, not 3/4 or 1/2 of a seat. If she wants to avoid any potential embarrassment in the future she should book a second seat. She can\u2019t expect other people to spend hours being smothered next to her and not try and move just to spare her feelings. You weren\u2019t loud, cruel or crazy about it. You handled it discreetly and respectfully. My only suggestion to handle it better (if it happens to you again) would be to try and sort this out before the flight takes off.", "It is an inconvenience, their lifestyle choices are inconveniencing other people. They are allowed to do this, to an extent, because their choices are something we as a society condone as we have decided it is in their freedom to do so.

I'm certain that the folks on either side of you were just as uncomfortable as you were.", "[removed]", "I'd say NTA - it's internalized prejudice that bigger people go through and it's hard to get over. However, seat adjustments are (generally) handled at the beginning of the flight, not halfway through. I am a bigger dude myself at 6'3\" and 300lbs. I understand that I take up more space - and I try to be extremely conscious of that to not impede on anyone else. I think I'd sigh in relief if caught in that situation. But, I'd have wished you had spoken to the flight attendant sooner - like when the plane was at the gate, not halfway through. \n\nIf it were me, I would have probably spoken to the flight attendant as the bigger person to see if I could move to a less crowded row at the start. My experience has been that the FAs generally look at me when boarding and try to make me and everyone else as comfortable as possible. Sad it doesn't happen all the time - but they try their best.", "NTA.

You being uncomfortable so her feelings are not hurt is incredibly inconsiderate of her. You are fine.", "NTA.

As a fat person myself, I would've been glad to have an empty seat to my side rather than an uncomfortable person. You did everything discreetly and without malice. That person was just mad cause she internalizes a lot of shame, which really sucks - I get it - but it wasn't because of you.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t say or do anything to her.

I can guarantee that the only person who thought about the subject, after you changed seats, was her, and that's her problem.", "NTA, I'm fluffy myself and hate the idea of making someone uncomfortable because I may be bigger.

Thank you.", "If you had yelled across the plane that you needed to move because the two plus sized folks on either side of you were smothering you to death and you needed to switch seats, essentially to continue living, that would have been fat shaming. \ud83d\ude09 Instead, you politely minded your own business in a free country.

I know some can't help, it's the hormones or whatever, but most of us are lazy fucks who have lost control over our eating/drinking habits. \n\nPeople who get offended at being called fat are not in touch with their reality. Fuck the size, my fitness and breathing is so bad, little humiliation helps. \n\nAnyways you didn't do any of the above. You didn't even make any public demonstration. You just chose to be not suffocated. If it was a little humiliating to her, she should just remember it and not stuff her face wit tacos and hamburgers the next opportunity she gets.", "NTA. You handled this as privately and discreetly as you could. The fact is an airplane is small. And people have eyes. They see you move from your middle seat between two plus sized passengers and they draw their own conclusions. That could not be helped. And one would think the two would be relieved to have more room.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t make a scene, you quietly found a different seat.

I apologized and thanked them.", "Nta. I once flew in a middle seat between two body builders, and at least they both had the grace to lean away from me so my shoulders fit in my seat. \n\nIf she wants to complain to anyone, it's the airlines fault in the first place for continuously making smaller seats.

There are tons of valid, non-bigoted reasons for needing more personal space.", "NTA - I'm a plus sized person and part of that is taking responsibility for yourselt.  You have to keep in mind that you take up more space than a smaller person.  It's my job as the large bodied mammal to stay in my lane, keep my body off other people and so on.   \n\n\nThat armrest is there for a reason.   \n\n\nInd if teh space is too small, then the larger  person should purchase more than one seat.", "NTA. What bullshit form of wokeness is this nonsense. You paid for a seat. You should have 100% access to your seat. Being fat does bot entitle anyone to invade anyones personal space. I sure as hell wouldn't be comfortable with some random people, irrespective of size constantly be in physical comtact with me at hours on end.", "NTA I am a plus size person. There's nothing wrong with what you did. The only embarrassment caused was in this woman's head. You tried to be discreet so no embarrassment was caused. You, too, have the right to be comfortable and you accomplished that. In the process you also gave these two passengers more room. There's a reason airliners prefer their plus size passengers have two seats. I was given two seats by an airline and was pre boarded and found nothing embarrassing about it.", "Nta. If you won\u2019t fit in 1 seat, you need to buy 2.", "NTA you did no such thing.  You moved yourself so you and THEY would be more comfortable.", "NTA. As a large traveller myself, I would be thankful that there was another seat available for OP.

I try to wedge myself against the window to give the neighbor as much room as possible.\n\nWhat probably happened was the two large passengers were flying together and booked the 2 outside seats hoping that nobody would take the middle seat (no chance of that nowadays).

That is why airlines make people buy more than one seat.", "NTA.  You did it subtly", "NTA...no way am I letting a total stranger be all rubbed up against me. Nasty", "Also, they should be happy that you moving would give them extra wiggle room too!", "Right? \n\nWould she have preferred you repeatedly asking them both to keep their body parts off of you no matter how they had to contort to do so? \n\nShe thought it was fair for you to be uncomfortable so no attention was put on her?", "Totally agree that the airlines making seats smaller are the biggest AH's here!", "Totally agree and I'm a bigger girl too.", "Agree wholeheartedly with this!", "Plus sized is just a \"nice\" way of saying fat.", "i honestly believe that if you\u2019re aware that you can\u2019t really fit into a single airline seat, it\u2019s your responsibility to buy a second one.", "Same.

Some flights have premium economy seating that is wider, and better suited to the dimensions of a fat person, but it's also expensive and comes with a load of extra premium frills that they might not want.", "I think this is such interesting sentiment. As a really tall person, I\u2019ve been uncomfortable on planes and never really able to \u201cfit\u201d in economy. Never did I once blame the airline industry, or anyone else?? I understand how businesses work, and I understand that I am not \u201cnormal\u201d sized, due to my height.

Economy seats literally do not make any money for most airlines. They are there to help fill the plane so that they can sell premium seats, or charge for extras, which is where all their profit comes from.
