You weren't comfortable and you discretely asked for another seat.  She's an AH for saying that drivel.\n\nThe biggest AH is airlines for making seats smaller for the past 20+ years.  It sucks now compared to when I flew in the 90s.", "NTA.  I'm not plus sized, I'm fat.  So maybe I shouldn't be speaking for plus-sized people, but speaking as a fat person, if you were sitting next to me, I would be very happy that a solution was found that made everyone more comfortable.  I'm very aware of when my fatness is invading another person's space and I am more embarrassed by that.  You talked to the attendant quietly.  It's not like you stood up and started shouting and calling them pigs or anything like that.  What you did was find a solution that allowed everyone to sit comfortably and maintain dignity.  Again, NTA", "I am sure *everybody* was more comfortable with you moving and making that middle seat empty. \n\nIt sounds like you were as discrete as anybody could be. You should have said \u201cI moved and gave you more room. *You are welcome\u201d.* And walked away. \n\nNTA those seats *are* terribly small.", "NTA. Her anger is misdirected. She can go ahead and be mad at the airlines for not accommodating people of her size, but it's a perfectly normal human response not to want to be touching someone you don't know and to take steps to make that not happen.", "This wasn't you fat shaming. This was you looking for comfort. Her feeling uncomfortable was her problem not yours. You didn't publicly shame her. You handled the situation extremely well. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all.  You gave it a try, it did not work out, you moved.  That woman who confronted you had a chip on her shoulder and is an AH.  As for others witnessing what happened, NO ONE WILL CARE/REMEMBER.", "NTA - I\u2019m a plus sized person and I wouldn\u2019t have been offended. Why should I make it uncomfortable for other people when there are other seats. That person has their own issues", "NTA and I'm fat. \n\nThe best answer would have been to say \"these seats/airlines are really fat phobic and designed to make us uncomfortable, so I figured if there was a way to give you more space it was the kinder thing to do.\" But also, don't stress this.", "America makes larger everything now. I\u2019m a nurse, and we have bariatric beds, chairs, wheelchairs. Car manufacturers are now mostly marking SUVs and vans for the sole purpose of more space for our \u201cgrowing\u201d population. The only industry who hasn\u2019t caught up with this is the airline industry. It get it, they can\u2019t maximize profits with larger seats. You can only make planes so big. \n\nNeither of these things are your problem, though. Plane tickets are expensive, and they\u2019re not getting cheaper. You paid for your ticket, as did they. That doesn\u2019t entitle them to whine when the size of their bodies interferes with your comfort and you request to move because they\u2019re invading your space, however unintentionally. You didn\u2019t fat shame anyone, and the woman\u2019s own issues with her body type were being projected onto you. That\u2019s not your problem either, it\u2019s hers.", "NTA, you handled it correctly. Hell I've done that on long flights just so I didn't have to sit between 2 people.", "NTA.

You never said a word to her or anyone else about it which shows she was already assuming someone would complain about her weight.", "NTA, you weren't shaming them, you just wanted to be reasonably comfortable.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything to embarrass her. Sounds like you tried your best NOT to embarrass her.", "NTA\n\nYou were discrete when moving. She needs to understand her size causes issues for other people and they shouldn\u2019t be forced to endure uncomfortable situations because of \u201cnot hurting her feelings\u201d. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, you said nothing to them and didn\u2019t announce your move to the entire plane.

She is pissy that you sought other seating arrangements bc her body was literally spilling into your seat and resting on top of you.  What buillshit.\n\nYou did the right thing by moving.  You bought a seat on a flight and she doesnt get to invade your area.  NTA", "NTA you were physically uncomfortable in your seat, because of the other passengers.

Why be uncomfortable for hours on end if you don\u2019t have to?

If you pay for a seat, you should be able to use it.", "Nta, she\u2019s projecting. Aside from that, you are paying to be comfortable in your seat during your flight. You can\u2019t use your seat as intended.\n\n If the plane can accommodate you, then you should take advantage of it.

She's the one who is embarrassing herself by calling her and the man flat out fat. All you did was get up and move for comfort not only to yourself but to them as well. \n\nNTA. You didn't call them fat, you didn't insinuate they are fat, all you did was get up and move.", "No. All passengers are renting space. If they can\u2019t fit in their rented space, they are \u2018stealing\u2019 your space. \n\nAt some point, a very large person would need to buy a second seat. You are not shaming them. You simply wanted the (not very to begin with) comfortable space you paid for. \n\nNTA", "NTA - you quietly asked the flight attendant if you could move as it was severely uncomfortable and they moved you.  \n\nSeems like a super reasonable moment.  \n\nI was once across the aisle from someone that smelled horrible- the lady next to him fought it out for a bit but couldn't take it. So she asked politely to move and got a new seat.   \n\nSomeone waiting for you off the plane feels super aggressive! People are crazy", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m happy you did what was best for you! You PAID for that seat and YOU should be comfortable.", "NTA\n\nYou're not treating fatness as a contagion.\n\nFat people on an airplane are indeed an inconvenience when their fat impinges on your seat. The problem here was that your neighbor's body didn't fit within the confines of her own seat. I'd have thought that it would have been uncomfortable for your neighbor to have to be pressed up against you, and your neighbor would also have been better off after you moved to another seat.", "NTA.  Don't let anyone tell you differently.", "NTA, you didn't make a scene and they found you a more workable seat. It's a shame air travel is so intrinsically cruel to larger folks, but I don't see how you could've done anything better yourself.", "Seems like she is insecure about herself and looking to blame someone for her life choices. I would have told her to mind her business and walked away. \n\nPeople get too easily offended these days and it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s job to cater to them. You did the right thing and you\u2019re definitely not TAH but she is.", "NTA.\n\nFat lady here; that was the most thoughtful thing for you to do in that situation.\n\nIt *definitely* contributed to everyone's comfort.\n\nYou're just getting splashback from her own sense of shame/tiredness/discomfort etc. It's awfully uncomfortable to travel while fat, I end up a jumble of nerves just due to anticipating assholes and awkward situations. That's not your responsibility or anyone else's.", "Im a passenger of size. Let me tell you. It ain\u2019t easy. But you handled that as diplomatically and compassionately as you could have. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. None of what you did was a public demonstration, you asked the flight attendant privately.", "Personally, I'd say NTA. Though, I would have grabbed my carry-on before getting up to ask the flight attendant if I could move, just so you didn't have to go back to that seat again and make it awkward. You weren't fat-shaming or anything, you were just really uncomfortable in that seat and wanted to move. You didn't make any comment about weight to them or anything, that was an assumption on her part. If she asked, you could've just said that you were uncomfortable in that seat and wanted to move, no further explanation needed. That lady frankly sounds insecure in her weight and decided to take out some pent up anger on you.\n\nYou didn't ask, get a no, and make a scene. I'm sure if you were told there were no other seat, you would've went back to your seat quietly and not said another word.", "NTA and you should have replied back saying 'I couldn't breathe'. You didn't cause a drama and you did what anyone else would do. Why should you suffer because some entitled lady could feel better at herself? Do not give in to these sort of people as they can book themselves a business class seat if they want to save the embarrassment or maybe take a coach.", "NTA", "Nta. You made your request quietly and discreetly. There are a thousand reasons somebody might want/need to move seats on an aeroplane and many of them have nothing to do with the seat neighbours.\n\nYou didn't shout across the plane \"hey, can I move seats because my neighbours are crushing me due to their size\" or anything like that (which would have made you TA)", "NTA, as a tall curvy woman (I fit in airplane seats, but not much wiggle room)  I would have been ecstatic to have the middle person take another seat to give everyone more room! You did it in a gentle and respectful way. The woman has issues.", "NTA I am plus sized, not enough to hang out of my airplane seat, but I fit in them rather snugly. Nobody wants their personal space invaded by others, on a plane though, it's a matter of fact that it's going to happen. But when a person's FLESH is RESTING ON YOUR BODY, that is downright uncomfortable. I feel like you were as tactful and unobtrusive about it as you could possibly be. It's not like you started a scene when your row companions took their seats, you gave it a go and waited until you could be as discreet as possible. I'd think THEY BOTH would have been GRATEFUL for the extra room you afforded them by moving... My daughter is obese from health issues the past 7 years and she literally buys TWO SEATS on domestic flights because she IS that big. She would not have been offended, but she rarely has any fucks to give in general...but yeah...you did the best you could and handled it as well as could be expected. Don't let one person's pettiness cause you any more concern, \"she ain't payin' rent, so kick her right outta your head\".", "NTA You handled the situation as privately and gently as possible. Some people are just incredibly sensitive about their size. She really had no right to confront you or speak for the other guy. You're supposed to just silently suffer? It's totally unfair.", "NTA. You did both seatmates a favor by giving them more room. so they were more comfortable. You we're the only one who benefitted from your decision.", "NTA \n\nI would be really uncomfortable to be sitting next to a stranger and being so close that we're touching, regardless of their size. \n\nI don't feel like she should have approached you and yelled at you, but I can understand where she is coming from because fat people are discriminated against.  She was probably feeling humiliated and her brain weasels were probably telling her that \"everyone on the plane saw this and now they're all laughing at me behind my back\".", "NTA - They were invading your personal space. Something that they couldn\u2019t do anything about due to the design of the airplane. You didn\u2019t insult them, or ask them to make some adjustment that was physically impossible for them to do. You walked up to the flight attendant and made your discomfort known. You didn\u2019t even talk about the issue in their presence!\n\nThat woman was an asshole! From the description of how the seat fails to accommodate her without taking up some other person\u2019s space she should have booked enough space for herself. OR expect the person who\u2019s space she is invading to do something about it to try to make themselves Comfortable. Because unfortunately airlines have tiny ass seats to save cost.", "I'd say NTA (might lean towards NAH). You did what you did to make yourself comfortable and clearly it was possible as it happened. I'm assuming she (and the other guy) were also more comfortable having enough space, so in that view it was a win for everyone.\n\nThe real assholes are uncomfortable small aeroplane seats.", "NTA. You paid for your ticket the same as they did. Why should you be forced to suffer just because they lack consideration and self-awareness? You paid for a full seat, not 3/4 or 1/2 of a seat. If she wants to avoid any potential embarrassment in the future she should book a second seat. She can\u2019t expect other people to spend hours being smothered next to her and not try and move just to spare her feelings. You weren\u2019t loud, cruel or crazy about it. You handled it discreetly and respectfully. My only suggestion to handle it better (if it happens to you again) would be to try and sort this out before the flight takes off.", "It is an inconvenience, their lifestyle choices are inconveniencing other people. They are allowed to do this, to an extent, because their choices are something we as a society condone as we have decided it is in their freedom to do so.

NTA.", "Sorry, but I don't believe this really happened.\n\nI'm a person of size, and if the person in the middle seat asked to be moved I would be grateful.  I'm certain that the folks on either side of you were just as uncomfortable as you were.", "[removed]", "I'd say NTA - it's internalized prejudice that bigger people go through and it's hard to get over. However, seat adjustments are (generally) handled at the beginning of the flight, not halfway through. I am a bigger dude myself at 6'3\" and 300lbs. I understand that I take up more space - and I try to be extremely conscious of that to not impede on anyone else. I think I'd sigh in relief if caught in that situation. But, I'd have wished you had spoken to the flight attendant sooner - like when the plane was at the gate, not halfway through. \n\nIf it were me, I would have probably spoken to the flight attendant as the bigger person to see if I could move to a less crowded row at the start. My experience has been that the FAs generally look at me when boarding and try to make me and everyone else as comfortable as possible. Sad it doesn't happen all the time - but they try their best.", "NTA.

What happens is they shorten leg room.\n\nWith the industry standardized on the 737/A320 airframe for most flights they can't do more than 6 seats per row in economy, 4 in 1st class.", "I mean at the same time people have got ludicrously wide in that same space of time.\n\nIt\u2019s like when your told Homer Simpson was designed as someone comically large in the late 80\u2019s and now he would just be considered chubby.", "I like this counterpoint, fuck airlines as they fuck you. Why pay 2x the price of a normal ticket", "I was on a flight recently and I had the window seat. The person next to me was taking up a lot of my space so I had to scrunch against the window. My neck was sore for days because of the off angle. And the person was asleep and their body was covering my headphone jack so I couldn\u2019t watch a movie. Honestly I was annoyed at the situation because I was uncomfortable, in pain for days, and I had intentionally chosen an airline with a lot of TV and movie choices because it was a very long flight. But I wasn\u2019t annoyed at the person next to me. They didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I was annoyed at the airline for knowing that situations like this happen every day but do nothing. It\u2019s ridiculous for the airlines to not try to come up with a solution. Pretending that it isn\u2019t happening isn\u2019t working.

Airplane flights aren't a basic need or anything, they're a luxury.\n\n\nAnd seriously we're not talking about that much money. Anyone flying around by airplane can afford a few dozen bucks more.\n\n\nPeople are enthusiastically choosing the lowest cost airline and then bitching that they're being treated like cattle. They can afford way more, if not, they shouldn't be flying around anyways.", "I\u2019d love to see more options for extra legroom or extra seat width but I do wonder how many of the people complaining would actually pay when it came to it.

Absolutely ridiculous", "Yeah. And I would even suffer through short flights for a cheaper rate. But when the flight is 4+ hours I usually start doing math about what more I could afford. I feel like comfort is something people feel guilty or bad about paying for, and I used to as well. Now I am willing to cut in some places to make more room for comfort in my life. Maybe cuz I'm getting older.", "Again, i think i\u2019m just used to public transport. Are americans really flying on planes where that\u2019s not the norm and maybe you never get buses and trains?", "I told my brother he just needs to suck it up and buy the extra leg room seats when he flies because he\u2019s well over six feet tall and his legs *dig* into the seat in front in front of him. It makes for a miserable flight for both him and the poor soul stuck in front of him.", "I am aging myself but I remember the first time I bought my own ticket to fly transcontinentally. I have paid the same amount to fly the same route in business class over the last several years. \n\nFlying has gotten much cheaper than it used to be.

I don\u2019t need to accept that someone is touching my body, no matter the excuse they think they have.", "Even that is becoming increasingly inaccessible to working class people.

We have less money this year despite having the same income as last year.

Flights overbook every chance they get and effectively steal seats paid for by someone else for the purpose of keeping it empty to cram someone else they booked when they didn't have anymore available chairs.\n\nThis flight wasn't full, but if they were traveling together, and it was, that seat would be taken whether they bought it or not, more than likely.", "Totally agree, cost of living is insane right now. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t particularly want to see airlines increasing the size of their seats because I\u2019m pretty sure those additional costs will come down to us eventually.", "I gave it a Google out of curiosity, and for me, it's closer to \u00a3400 in train tickets and about 10hrs (glasgow to London and then London to Amsterdam)\n\nWhereas it's about \u00a3110 in flight costs and just under 2hrs", "There\u2019s no situation where your idea doesn\u2019t lead to business level prices", "intent absolutely matters, how can it possibly not? you\u2019re allowed to have good intentions *and* fail at the same time. it isn\u2019t mutually exclusive \n\ni\u2019m sorry you see it that way, and you don\u2019t seem to be open to changing your opinion even in the face of a professional and expert on the topic saying otherwise \n\nnothing i say will change your mind as your opinion is entirely inflexible to new expertise on the topic\n\n*this* is why air travel is so poor these days. it is because passengers have the immovable opinion that airlines are actively creating a product that causes suffering. in reality that isn\u2019t even close", "Some of them do. I flew Delta last week and for an extra $225, spouse and I could have had more legroom for that part of the trip. Like screw that, that\u2019s half the price of what we paid for a round-trip ticket.", "> intent absolutely matters, how can it possibly not?\n\nIf I broke your arm by accident, or broke your arm on purpose, your arm is still broken. The impact of the act is the exact same, there is not the slightest difference in the outcome to the person harmed. Saying \"sorry, I didn't mean to break your arm\" doesn't do anything to fix it. Nor does \"I didn't MEAN to break your arm.\" \n\nIf, regardless of impact, you refuse to do anything to fix the situation after it's been brought to your attention and just fall back on \"well, I didn't MEAN to\" then it's still just an excuse, and again, the same as doing it on purpose. Whether you're actively or passively creating suffering, you're creating suffering, and the impact on the clients is absolutely identical. And the moment you're aware and refuse to fix it, you are not ACTIVELY creating suffering. \n\nShould we talk about the number of disabled people who have DIED because airlines have destroyed life saving equipment? Should their families be ok with it because the airline didn't MEAN to kill them, even though they've done absolutely nothing to change their policies on carrying life-saving equipment? Yeah, intention means literally nothing.", "NTA\nThis happened to me yesterday on a SouthWest flight. Full plane and I was group C so not a lot of choice of seats by the time I got on. I spent the entire flight squished in between 2 very large people. I realistically had about 1/2 seat and I wasn\u2019t able to put down my tray because they both had very large tummies.\nI really wanted to ask to move but it was Southwest, no seats and I didn\u2019t pay a heap for the flight. But I really think that if someone needs to take up more than one seat then they need to pay for two.", "I was about ready to say \"n a h, we've just gotten fatter\", but then I read the numbers, and by golly, [you're right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_seat).  From the 80's to now, average width has gone from 19 to 17 inches, and pitch has gone from 35 to 31.  We used to have over 25% more room!  \n\nOh, and OP?  NTA.  If you can't fit in one seat, you buy two.  If you don't like how that makes you feel, tough shit.  I'm 6'3\", 250 pounds, and I make damn sure I don't spread into neighboring seats that I didn't pay for.", "While I agree, I get a different image in my head when I hear the words as there are people who are overweight but barely and see themselves (or others see them) as fat.

And some \u201cplus size\u201d people also can\u2019t reduce their weight for whatever private medical reasons.

Instead she could have been sitting next to somebody that didn't give a flying fuck about discretion or embarrassing her or the other passenger.", "I like this answer.", "Just pay more.

How small a population size are we talking about in these upper echelons?  I'm not sure it makes economic sense for the airlines to make all seats sized for the largest possible people that might show up.", "Key word, some", "i think you missed the \"last 10 years part\". even 20 years ago it was the same", "I'm in the US but lived in Europe for a few years.  I once flew from Milan to London for 12 euro; it was amazing.  Flights are absolutely not cheap like this in the US.

Flying recently I had literal bruises on my legs and had to take pain meds cause it hurt so much being pressed against the back of a seat for 30 hours :( luckily I was flying with my short friend and she let me spread into her section a bit but if I was flying with my bf (whose also over 6ft) we\u2019d both be in a lottta pain.", "Same here - I somehow try to will myself to not take up as much space. (Window seats are the worst, I\u2019ve found)", ">I\u2019d have no problem paying prices based on 20 years ago for the seat size 20 years ago.\n\nNo you wouldn't lol. 20 years ago wasn't even in the 2000s. You're thinking of the 80s", "If seats are thinner then where is that space going? The planes are still the same size, and the planes still fit the same number of seats width wise.

Frontier is rough, but money's tight (and so is this airplane).", "No one does. Not even on Ryanair. Unless someone is currently moving around, no one ever touches you constantly. The only way this could happen, again, even on Ryanair seats, is if they are obese.\n\nYou don't get to touch anyone. If it happens though, as an accident, you say sorry and move on. But continuously touching someone on a plane? Never heard of that before nor seen it, and I've seen people fight over much less.\n\nPlus, I and many others find constant human touch from strangers to be literally disgusting. Doesn't matter if they're fat or not.", "What should have OP done differently in your opinion? It seems like you\u2019re suggesting she should have stayed in the seat? You should also absolutely tell someone tall using your legroom to move their legs - you paid for that space.", "I just flew down to California via YVR (from Nanaimo but the price was the same for Victoria) and somehow the tickets averaged $200 each way. I don't even know how that made sense because the tickets if I had ferried over and flown out of Vancouver would've been about $180 each and I'm sure the 12 minute flight from Nanaimo would've been at least that much on its own as well.

I\u2019ve never been on a European metro during busy times and not been touched during long periods of the journey", "Yeah, that doesn't work any more.
