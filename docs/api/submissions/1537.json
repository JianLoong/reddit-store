{"id": 1537, "submission_id": "ymrt2u", "title": "AITA for insisting that I have nothing to apologize for after my husband read my diary?", "selftext": "I'm trying to stay focused here but my edibles have kicked in and I need advice.\n\nI have kept a diary since I was 10. It is my form of therapy, & I do not police my thoughts. I have never let anyone read my diary. \n\nMy husband & I started dating over a decade ago. One day a couple of months in, he was over at my apartment, & I had hopped in the shower. When I came out, he was sitting on the bed shell-shocked. He said he read my journal, which was mostly about my life as a newly single woman. He told me it really stung to read all that. \n\n*\"But wait. Hold on. How'd you find it?\"*\n\nHe said he was looking for matches. He couldn't tell me why he kept reading even after he knew what it was, but his apology was sincere & I forgave him. Not too long after that, things got messy. He started getting either very sad or very angry while referring to things he read. His feelings were so intense that I STARTED APOLOGIZING FOR MY THOUGHTS. \n\nAnyway, we got married. \n\nA decade later, I was thinking of a divorce & wrote a ton to process my thoughts about some sensitive topics. Again, he \"stumbled\" upon my journal & read it all. I was pissed, but he convinced me that he would never do it again. Besides, he was really hurt by the things I wrote, and I felt bad. I let it go, but he started getting sad or angry again thinking about what he had read. Once more, the intensity of his feelings led me to apologize for my thoughts.\n\nNow here we are, married with kids, setting up Scrabble on a Friday night. He went to find a piece of paper & came back quiet & distracted. I asked if everything was okay. He looked at me sharply & told me that he just read my journal. I tensed, thinking of how I recently tackled some tough feelings related to our different ethnic & religious backgrounds. I wrote things that would have been hurtful to read, & I was mortified knowing that he did read them, but I was also annoyed. \n\n*\"Wait. You read my journal again?\"*\n\nHe blamed me for leaving it out & accused me of being a bad person for what I wrote but honestly I wasn't listening to him anymore. I just wanted to know why we were dealing with this again. It's pretty fucking basic knowledge that one shouldn't read other people's diaries, right? But look at him, forcing his way into my brain & shaming me for what he saw. I surprised myself by slamming my hand on the table. \n\n*\"A THIRD TIME??\"* \n\nWe were both hurt, but he was accusing me of overreacting while minimizing and deflecting from his behavior. He called me \"overly emotional\" when I cried over how violated I felt. This feels so wrong, like I committed a thoughtcrime. \n\nSo AITA for insisting he's 100% wrong? I'm so mad, but I am doubting whether my reaction was proportional to what he did. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being terrible), what would you rate someone reading your journal? & would you apologize for the things you wrote?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your comments. I am overwhelmed. For those suggesting therapy, I have been in it for a long time, and I credit it for listening to the little voice in my head instead of ignoring it. Therapy gave me the insight to see what he was doing in real time.  \n\nBut to those saying YTA and ESH, all I can say is that this type of behavior has been normalized so much for me, and I have been gaslit for so long, that I automatically convinced myself it wasn't *that bad*. I feel like I'm emerging from the upside-down, and I have to relearn basic social norms. You have no idea how sad all of this makes me.", "created_utc": 1667649153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymrt2u/aita_for_insisting_that_i_have_nothing_to/", "score": 740, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has broken your trust 3 times, and after the first time knew that he might not like what you had written. Sounds like he uses reading your journal as a way to understand how you\u2019re feeling, rather than actually asking you. The whole point of a journal is that you get to articulate your feelings, unedited, in a private place. He has disrespected that on 3 separate occasions. If he didn\u2019t want to be upset by what he read, he shouldn\u2019t have read it", "NTA. He\u2019s had his 3 strikes; he\u2019s out.", "NTA. He basically did the equivalent of listening at the door of a therapy session. Everyone thinks things that they would never say out loud. It's his fault he keeps going and searching for your journal. If you stay with him I'd get a safe that uses your fingerprint or something. He clearly will do it again.", "NTA.\n\nThis is the same as someone eavesdropping on therapy sessions. You're allowed to feel the things you do and he's breaching your trust in a major way.", "NTA. He is 100% in the wrong. Totally on him and him only. He could be visible on the table and he still should be able to not read it.

Cos it just doesn't seem like something that he just starts up doing again after a decade after having not done it the whole time. Seems kinda like a habit to him, that he still doesn't see anythinng wrong with. So why would he have actually stopped?\n\nAlso seems a little coincedental that he just happened to read it these rare few times which happened to also be times he read something that upset him.\n\nHe's 100% wrong. For the *third time* (that you know of).\n\nYou're allowed to have uncomplimentary and negative thoughts about your relationship, and to write them down in a place he is never supposed to see. If he doesn't have the respect or the self control not to read your journal he can hardly complain when it sometimes contains bad things about him, but most of all he just really must have that respect. And he has shown that he doesn't, repeatedly. And then has the gall to act like you've wronged him. Gah.", "NTA. I can't believe he blamed you for reading your diary...", "NTA. \n\nFrankly I don't understand why you would continue  dating someone who proved he couldn't be trusted not to snoop through your possessions and had the audacity to complain about what you've written in your PRIVATE journal. But, you chose to stay in for 10 years, got married, had kids. If you plan on staying in the marriage, you need to accept your man has proven his word isn't his bond. His righteous indignation is a false flag. He's trying to make you feel terrible for your PRIVATE thoughts. He is the one who should be apologizing. Stand your ground on this. Point out to him that everyone has negative thoughts about their lives along with the people in them and that you know he does it too. The difference is most people don't put their thoughts to paper. He had no right to poke his nose into your personal brain droppings and, if he wants to remain angry, he only has himself to blame for an unethical action, invasion of privacy. \n\nThen, buy yourself a lockbox that he can't break into (padlock with combo he can't guess) and store your journal in it. If he gets angry about it, tell him it's too bad you had to go to great lengths like this because he's proven he can't be trusted.", "NTA. Reading someone\u2019s diary it a huge breach of privacy. I would definitely rate that a 10.", "NTA.  I view this as a 10. And this is not the third time.", "NTA\n\nBut this is who this man is. He's shown a consistent pattern of disrespecting your clearly stated boundaries, and he will continue to do so.\n\nDon't be surprised when he does it a fourth, fifth, sixth time.", "NTA.  Does he realize he's creating the problem, not you?  It's almost like he sees your diary as a way to find reasons to get upset.  Who does that?!  I'd be so mad also if I were you... and I'd absolutely stop apologizing.  You have done nothing wrong and yet he continues to violate your privacy.", "You are absolutely NTA. Your husband is. Everyone knows what is in a diary is personal and shouldn't be read by anyone. I my have forgiven him the first time, but definitely not after that. Reading your diary not only shows he doesn't respect you, but shows he doesn't trust you.", "NTA. You\u2019ve made it clear that your diary is a place for all thoughts, good and bad, that are meant to be kept private.

My ex husband read my journal too. He didn't like what he read (he cheated, I had a lot of thoughts about it) but he shouldn't have looked in the first place. He did it to himself. Its a 10 on the scale of terribleness imo. I can't even keep a journal now because I'm so paranoid that my current partner might come across it.", "I\u2019m not sure why you let it get to a third time without securing your journals. But NTA for not apologizing to him getting his feeling hurt by reading your journal. He A) is the one that made you feel that way to begin with and B) is the one who chose to expose himself you your unfiltered thoughts will fill knowledge that you didn\u2019t want him to. Get a lock box.", "NTA. Not at all. He repeatedly disrespects and invades your privacy. Everyone deserves privacy to work through their shit. You can't be honest when you have to worry about someone invading your space.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. Your journal is clearly your way of processing your feelings. Even if you write in the moment, something that is an overreaction, that is your way of processing and grounding yourself. It does not sound like you are sharing these journals with anyone else so while I can understand that your spouse would be upset they he is reading about himself in a negative light, he also needs to realize after all this time that this is your way of processing mental struggles", "NTA.  He has a problem trusting you, obviously. Unfortunately, it seems pretty deeply seated in him since it's been going on for so long; I'd be unsurprised if it turns out he reads your diary regularly and only admits to it when he has these \"hurt\" reactions. Highly recommend couples counseling to address this issue.", "NTA He is using your emotions against you, he is emotionally abusing you. You might have kids togheter but this relation is not healthy, You maybe should divorce him if he refuses to change. His behavior is manipulative and really wrong. He broke your trust and you is the one to apologize?! You should never apologize for you own feelings and thoughts!", "NTA.  At all.", "NTA and its your thoughts!! I'm sure all of his thoughts about you, your marriage etc. aren't always great and if you knew them you would be upset as well, but he doesn't write his down. Maybe you need to buy a safe and lock it away and do not leave the combo anywhere.", "NTA But damn, your husband is. I had an ex read my journal. Holy breach of trust. The relationship didn\u2019t recover and there were admittedly other factors. But zero regrets leaving that ex in the rear view. \n\nIn short, journals are PRIVATE unless you give explicit permission to read it. If he isn\u2019t trustworthy enough to not read, what else can\u2019t you trust?", "NTA. Don\u2019t you dare apologize for anything that was written. It wasn\u2019t written for him, it wasn\u2019t written to be read. He absolutely has thoughts that would hurt you if you had access to them, the difference is you don\u2019t. \n\nHe knows full well not to read it and I\u2019m willing to bet he has read it more than the 3 times you know about given the fact he straight out said \u201cI read your diary.\u201d \n\nIn your position\u2026 I won\u2019t lie, I would be pretty tempted to throw down an ultimatum- couples therapy or divorce, and if I ever found out it happened again straight to divorce. \n\nYou apologizing in the past validated his feelings of entitlement to your private thoughts and feelings. This time if he gets sad \u201cwell that\u2019s what you get for reading things that are none of your business.\u201d If he tries to bring up anything he read, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, I\u2019ve never raised that with you and until I do it\u2019s not a problem because it\u2019s a private thought that you violated and don\u2019t have any right to feel anything about.\u201d", "NTA.   1 to 10, 10 for reading someone's  diary.

You should reconsider a divorce", "So at base, he is saying:  stop deflecting back to the thing I am deflecting away from. How dare you ?!!   Don't apologise for a thing. Take back all the previous apologies. NTA.", "NTA, but you need to understand what this means. He does not think you deserve any privacy. He does not respect your boundaries. He is willing to go behind your back and find out whatever he wants to fit his narrative and make you feel bad about it. Is this really the partner you want in your life moving forward?", "NTA.  And it's probably been more than three times.", "NTA. The issue is about respect. He has shown, over and over and over again, that he has no respect for your privacy, your feelings, or your thoughts. There's a saying, once in am occurrence, twice is a coincidence, and three time's a pattern. This is a pattern of disrespect. You have a right to have your own private thoughts and feelings, and the right to work them out in a diary. Frankly, he has no right to be upset. Also, look at the pattern. He habitually looks through your journal and then gets to use his invasion of privacy as a stick to beat you with. He puts you in the position of having to beg his forgiveness repeatedly. I would think really, really hard about the nature of this relationship going forward, if I were you.", "I'm inclined to say Y T A for letting it get this far and apologising to him at all. And btw it absolutely isn't the THIRD time he's done this. It's the third time he found something to be upset about. Either be honest with each other and let him roam free through your private thoughts or admit you have no privacy in your own house and get a locked box or something to hide your diary and find a method to be able to tell when he's read it.

Fill it with progressively angry rants about my husband reading my journal and then channel the spirits of great horror writers  and write a murder plot.

Neither of which are divorce...yet, though that's up to you.\n\n1) A lockable box or personal safe. Make it known to him that you will be keeping your \"evil journal\" away from him this way and from now on he'll be safe from your inner turmoil.

Frankly, at this point it's like a child touching the element on a stove and being shocked they got burned, and then going back only to cry about how that element shouldn't be hot in the first place. At some point the man needs to learn to avoid  it or at least admit he's trying to police you.\n\nHonestly...I'm being hella charitable in this post, but people say \"suggesting divorce\" is too common and quick on this site, and admittedly divorce can be messier than what I've suggested.\n\nNTA", "He's been reading it the whole time.

Not to you, but he is also setting a horrible example for your kids of how adults more specifically how fathers are supposed to act.", "NTA! This honestly seems abusive, at least emotionally. He is purposely seeking out your diary and reading it. He is making a repeated choice to violate your privacy and the lashes out when he doesn\u2019t like the shit that he reads. He then manipulates you into feeling like you\u2019re the problem when it\u2019s him who is the problem. It\u2019s not hard to be respectful of your partner\u2019s boundaries and he\u2019s choosing not to. Because to him, he comes first. Not you and your boundaries. This would be a hill to die on.

That is absolutely not okay, he's disrespecting your boundaries and violating your trust and honestly, your head. He has no right. Then he tried to make himself the victim. That's abusive tactics 101. Red flags. And you bet it's been more than 3 times. Many, many more. Put a strand of hair or something on it, some glitter or something, so you can see if it's been moved.", "Does husband have anything personal that he wouldn't want anyone going through? If so ask him how would he feel if you went through his personal things and even if you left your journal out that does NOT mean he can read it. He has absolutely NO right to read your diary ask him to explain why he thinks your diary is his personal reading material. What makes him think it's ok to read your diary. Why does he think oh OP'S journal is there I think I'll read that. Tell him that he has violated your trust so UNLESS he  EXPLAINS WHY HE THINKS IT'S OK TO READ OTHER PEOPLE'S DIARY AND WHY HE DOESN'T THINK HE SHOULD BE GROVELLING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS.  Tell him you are not in the wrong for having thoughts, feelings and opinions and since you wrote them down in your diary. You know something personal. That he should not of gone through.

He only owns up to it when he feels like there\u2019s something in there he needs to confront you about.  It\u2019s hugely invasive and manipulative behavior, and he\u2019s using it to control your behavior and minimize his violation of your privacy by making you feel guilty for expressing your feelings.  You should absolutely not let this go.", "NTA  but there's a saying - once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, three times is enemy action.  He didn't make a mistake.  He has repeatedly violated your privacy.  He's going to do it again.  He's manipulating you and he is emotionally abusive.  You deserve better.", "NTA. I don't want to victim blame because I know you are in therapy and working on yourself, but it wasn't a red flag for you that he read your private journal and blamed you for your thoughts the first two times? Are you going to forgive him again? You KNOW he is going to read it again right? This is a pattern of behavior. It's not going to stop. I'm not saying divorce him right away, but I would make it EXTREMELY clear that if he does this again, that it will be relationship ending. You will leave him. End of story. Your personal thoughts go onto that journal and they are not for him. You write it down to work through things for yourself and he purposely reads it and uses the information against you. It's abusive and wrong. He is the bad person in this scenario and he needs to realize that.", "NTA- this man is repeatedly violating your privacy in an attempt to find a reason to fight with you. You realize that right? Like he wants to be mad at you and make you feel bad so he\u2019s using your very healthy coping mechanism against you.

You have nothing to apologize for; especially after your husband has read your diary THREE times.

I'm talking steel with a multiple number lock that you update frequently and a secondary lock that keeps the box locked to a heavy object. Put important to you papers in there as well. Check Amazon.\n\nOh, and NTA!! He's gaslighting you, and you deserve more than a partner who is emotionally abusive.", "Nta but please divorce him though. If he does it to you he will read your kids diaries too and they may wonder why you didn\u2019t stop him and kept on giving him chances every time he read yours. No offence him doing that is not your fault I\u2019m just saying you are kind of undereacting to him doing it. Good luck op.", "NTA he\u2019s shown you can\u2019t trust him or his word.

Sadly she can't read it anymore as an adult. She also told me, she would always respect my privacy if I wrote a diary and as far as I'm aware she did.\n\nHe violated your privacy several times, so he's not trustworthy. Leave him.", "There was an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond where Marie (his mother) was hurt by what she read in his diary 25 years prior and expected an apology from him. His wife, Debra being the voice of reason exclaimed that it was private thoughts of a teen boy..until Marie told Debra that he wrote \"I hate my mom\" at which point they both made him apologize and everything was ok with the world again.\n\nThis is, of course, total bullshit. A journal is a private space for a person to organize their inner thoughts and feelings and it doesn't matter if its your spouse/parent/child/etc no one and I mean NO ONE has the right to invade that space. \n\nThere needs to be a very real discussion with your husband about personal space and privacy because a marriage certificate is not a frenzied free for all with access to every thought, feeling, desire you will have till death do you part. Truly disgusting to me that anyone would turn their invasion of your privacy into something that is all about them and make you feel like you need to apologize(?) for being a complex human being. If I did that to my wife even once she would have walked right out the door and I wouldn't blame her.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI am drunk and taken edibles right now  but when I read this.... yikes!\n\nWhy is he reading your diary?!!  That is a violation.  It is NOT the third time, he has done this more often then you know.\n\nYes, it is thoughtcrime.  So dictatorial.so 1984 of him.  Then he has the nerve to emotionally manipulate you when he was the one who read it.\n\nI am questioning as to why you married him when you caught him reading your diary before marriage?\n\nHe is a manipulative one, for sure.", "NTA\n\nhe keeps violating your private thoughts over and over again and you end up saying youre sorry for your felings about the things that are happening to you at that moment. things that he has said to you in that moment that you were writing about. you are apologizing for the things he did... he does not  respect your privacy or your need to write about things so you have space and privacy to work things out so you can be healthy.\n\nget a very secure safe or something to lock your journal in. if he gets mad then tell him its either that or one of you packs up and leaves. he doesnt respect your privacy.", "NTA. and fyi he reads it all the time. Then when he finds something to come at you with he gaslights you. Your diary should be a boundary no one crosses. Put it in a safe from now on. You can get one for 30 bucks on Amazon with a numeric code and a set of keys.", "You should have one of those locked diaries you can only open with a key. I\u2019m furious for you.  Just can\u2019t have any privacy anymore at all because of these nosy nellies trying to get into your stuff. That\u2019s why at 12 years old I stopped writing ANYTHING down because even my friends couldn\u2019t stop themselves from getting into my stuff.

He isn't accidentally looking.", "NTA - you should be free to write whatever you want in a journal. It's essentially just a written record of your thought process. So if you aren't allowed to write it, it's almost saying what you are and are not allowed to think. \n\nThe first time he read it, even though it's very obvious you shouldn't read it, you could maybe forgive him. I think it would be easy to understand the temptation. That doesn't really excuse it, but at least it can be understood.  And you were thoughtful enough to try and make him feel better.\n\nThe 2nd time - i don't think that was forgivable (if it was even forgivable the first time). But your forgave him again and apologized again to make him feel better.\n\nThe third time is beyond unforgivable. And for him to say you are overreacting is pretty shitty considering how much he overreacted from reading your private journal. You are the one who was violated THREE times, and yet you forgave him for the pain he felt even though that pain was 100% his fault. Now when you finally felt pain, he wanted to brush it away?\n\nNope. You are definitely not the ahole here.\n\nHe owes you a BIG apology. And some sort of promise, with consequences, that he will never ever read your journal ever again.", "Nta. Drop the disrespectful bastard.", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like he is a glutton for punishment.", "10. NTA.", "YTA. For tolerating this for so long", "NTA but you're married to a big one", "NTA. A journal is private thoughts and feelings, giving you the ability to work through things and share how you felt in the moment. You\u2019re not texting with a side piece or talking shit about him to friends and family, in theory it\u2019s only between you and you.\n\nHe has repeatedly betrayed your trust with this, he\u2019s clearly searching for it, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s read it more than the 3 times you know about.\n\nI suggest you get a chest or a lock box where only you have the key or combination. He clearly lacks self control to not read something private and personal, so you unfortunately need to take another step to keep it away from him or he\u2019ll likely read it again.", ">Now here we are, married with kids\n\n\nNTA, but dude WHY. \n\n\nHe's obviously been reading this continuously. Imagine how easier it is to manipulate someone if you constantly read their private thoughts and fears. \n\n\nI'm sure that looking back you can spot way way way more times where he used knowledge gained from reading your diary to his advantage.", "NTA. The first time is almost excusable, after that his reading your journal is a deliberate act of invading your privacy.", "So let me get this straight. Every single time he has read your journal it has been when you have been thinking about breaking up or divorce? Are you sure he hasn't been reading it this entire time and only 'accidentally' reading it when you mention you're thinking about leaving him? \n\n\nHonestly think back hard because if it is every single time you have ever journaled about separating with him that he has magically found it and no other times? That's a much larger problem. If you've had these thoughts before and documented them in your journal, but he didn't find the journal during those times, I would be much less suspicious.", "What a disgusting man. I\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t even trust your own husband to realize you deserve any semblance of privacy. NTA.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid. It's brave to work through all that inner stuff because it's not easy to confront or be that honest in a world full of comfortable delusions. \n\nHe could have stopped once he realized what it was, so no excuse. He read because he wanted to and didn't respect your method of working out your life and thoughts/feelings. He hunted those journals the 2nd and 3rd time imo. \n\nI hope you all can work through it.", "NTA. If you cross over a Keep Out sign and stuff goes sideways, it's your own fault.

But maybe there were reasons. \n\nHe\u2019s shown you who he is, though. Believe him.

That was almost 20 years ago. I get it that it was just sibling antics but yeah, it crushed something in me. My 5 year old journals. I don't look and very much keep her older brother from looking.
