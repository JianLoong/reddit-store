It is my form of therapy, & I do not police my thoughts. I have never let anyone read my diary. \n\nMy husband & I started dating over a decade ago. One day a couple of months in, he was over at my apartment, &I had hopped in the shower. When I came out, he was sitting on the bed shell-shocked. He said he read my journal, which was mostly about my life as a newly single woman. He told me it really stung to read all that. \n\n\"But w*ait. Hold on. How'd you find it?*\" \n\nHe said he was looking for matches. He couldn't tell me why he kept reading even after he knew what it was, but his apology was sincere & I forgave him. Not too long after that, things got messy. He started getting either very sad or very angry while referring to things he read. His feelings were so intense that I STARTED APOLOGIZING FOR MY THOUGHTS. \n\nAnyway, we got married. \n\nA decade later, I was thinking of a divorce & wrote a ton to process my thoughts about some sensitive topics. Again, he \"stumbled\" upon my journal & read it all. I was pissed, but he convinced me that he would never do it again. Besides, he was really hurt by the things I wrote, and I felt bad. I let it go but began apologizing when he got sad or angry thinking about what he had read. Once more, the intensity of his feelings led me to apologize for my thoughts.\n\nNow here we are, married with kids, setting up Scrabble on a Friday night. He went to find a piece of paper & came back quiet & distracted. I asked if everything was okay. He looked at me sharply & told me that he just read my journal. I tensed, thinking of how I recently tackled some tough feelings related to our different ethnic & religious backgrounds. I wrote things that would have been hurtful to read, & I was mortified knowing that he did read them, but I was also annoyed. \n\n*\"Wait. You read my journal again?\"*\n\nHe blamed me for leaving it out & accusing me of being a bad person for what I wrote but honestly I wasn't listening to him anymore. I just wanted to know why we were dealing with this again. It's pretty fucking basic knowledge that one shouldn't read other people's diaries, right? But look at him, forcing his way into my brain & shaming me for what he saw. I surprised myself by slamming my hand on the table. \n\n\"*A THIRD TIME??\"* \n\nWe were both hurt, but he was accusing me of overreacting while minimizing and deflecting from his behavior. He called me \"overly emotional\" when I cried over how violated I felt. This feels so wrong, like I committed a thoughtcrime. \n\nSo AITA for insisting he's 100% wrong? I'm so mad, but I am doubting whether my reaction was proportional to what he did. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being terrible), what would you rate someone reading your journal? & would you apologize for the things you wrote?", "created_utc": 1667649153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymrt2u/aita_for_insisting_that_i_have_nothing_to/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But this breach of privacy really calls for couple counseling.", "You willingly married someone after they proved time and again that they have no problem crossing your boundaries and then punishing you for what\u2019s inside that journal. \nLeave the ah.

Diaries are private and he should know this. He should not have read it and it\u2019s fully understandable that you\u2019re mad.", "NTA. He has broken your trust 3 times, and after the first time knew that he might not like what you had written. Sounds like he uses reading your journal as a way to understand how you\u2019re feeling, rather than actually asking you. The whole point of a journal is that you get to articulate your feelings, unedited, in a private place. He has disrespected that on 3 separate occasions. If he didn\u2019t want to be upset by what he read, he shouldn\u2019t have read it", "NTA. He\u2019s had his 3 strikes; he\u2019s out.", "NTA. He basically did the equivalent of listening at the door of a therapy session. Everyone thinks things that they would never say out loud. It's his fault he keeps going and searching for your journal. If you stay with him I'd get a safe that uses your fingerprint or something. He clearly will do it again.", "NTA.\n\nThis is the same as someone eavesdropping on therapy sessions. You're allowed to feel the things you do and he's breaching your trust in a major way.", "NTA. He is 100% in the wrong. Totally on him and him only. He could be visible on the table and he still should be able to not read it. He is manipulating you and gaslighting you.\n\nEdit: you said once that you were considereding divorce, i advice you to reconsider it again.", "NTA\n\nI just recently found out a family member has been reading my journals and then complaining to other family members about things I wrote about them. \n\ni am f\\*cking ropeable about it. \n\nTen times worse when its your partner and this has already been an issue. \n\nDo you have any particular reason to think he ever *stopped* reading your journals? Cos it just doesn't seem like something that he just starts up doing again after a decade after having not done it the whole time. Seems kinda like a habit to him, that he still doesn't see anythinng wrong with. So why would he have actually stopped?\n\nAlso seems a little coincedental that he just happened to read it these rare few times which happened to also be times he read something that upset him.\n\nHe's 100% wrong. For the *third time* (that you know of).\n\nYou're allowed to have uncomplimentary and negative thoughts about your relationship, and to write them down in a place he is never supposed to see. If he doesn't have the respect or the self control not to read your journal he can hardly complain when it sometimes contains bad things about him, but most of all he just really must have that respect. And he has shown that he doesn't, repeatedly. And then has the gall to act like you've wronged him. Gah.", "NTA. I can't believe he blamed you for reading your diary...", "NTA. \n\nFrankly I don't understand why you would continue  dating someone who proved he couldn't be trusted not to snoop through your possessions and had the audacity to complain about what you've written in your PRIVATE journal. But, you chose to stay in for 10 years, got married, had kids. If you plan on staying in the marriage, you need to accept your man has proven his word isn't his bond. His righteous indignation is a false flag. He's trying to make you feel terrible for your PRIVATE thoughts. He is the one who should be apologizing. Stand your ground on this. Point out to him that everyone has negative thoughts about their lives along with the people in them and that you know he does it too. The difference is most people don't put their thoughts to paper. He had no right to poke his nose into your personal brain droppings and, if he wants to remain angry, he only has himself to blame for an unethical action, invasion of privacy. \n\nThen, buy yourself a lockbox that he can't break into (padlock with combo he can't guess) and store your journal in it. If he gets angry about it, tell him it's too bad you had to go to great lengths like this because he's proven he can't be trusted.", "NTA. Reading someone\u2019s diary it a huge breach of privacy. I would definitely rate that a 10.", "NTA.  I view this as a 10. And this is not the third time.", "NTA\n\nBut this is who this man is. He's shown a consistent pattern of disrespecting your clearly stated boundaries, and he will continue to do so.\n\nDon't be surprised when he does it a fourth, fifth, sixth time.", "NTA.  Does he realize he's creating the problem, not you?  It's almost like he sees your diary as a way to find reasons to get upset.  Who does that?!  I'd be so mad also if I were you... and I'd absolutely stop apologizing.  You have done nothing wrong and yet he continues to violate your privacy.", "You are absolutely NTA. Your husband is. Everyone knows what is in a diary is personal and shouldn't be read by anyone. I my have forgiven him the first time, but definitely not after that. Reading your diary not only shows he doesn't respect you, but shows he doesn't trust you.", "NTA. You\u2019ve made it clear that your diary is a place for all thoughts, good and bad, that are meant to be kept private. Reading you\u2019re diary multiple times after being told not to is a gross breach of trust. Consider these are also only the times he\u2019s told you he\u2019s read it", "Nta. My ex husband read my journal too. He didn't like what he read (he cheated, I had a lot of thoughts about it) but he shouldn't have looked in the first place. He did it to himself. Its a 10 on the scale of terribleness imo. I can't even keep a journal now because I'm so paranoid that my current partner might come across it.", "I\u2019m not sure why you let it get to a third time without securing your journals. But NTA for not apologizing to him getting his feeling hurt by reading your journal. He A) is the one that made you feel that way to begin with and B) is the one who chose to expose himself you your unfiltered thoughts will fill knowledge that you didn\u2019t want him to. Get a lock box.", "NTA. Not at all. He repeatedly disrespects and invades your privacy. Everyone deserves privacy to work through their shit. You can't be honest when you have to worry about someone invading your space.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. Your journal is clearly your way of processing your feelings. Even if you write in the moment, something that is an overreaction, that is your way of processing and grounding yourself. It does not sound like you are sharing these journals with anyone else so while I can understand that your spouse would be upset they he is reading about himself in a negative light, he also needs to realize after all this time that this is your way of processing mental struggles", "NTA.  He has a problem trusting you, obviously. Unfortunately, it seems pretty deeply seated in him since it's been going on for so long; I'd be unsurprised if it turns out he reads your diary regularly and only admits to it when he has these \"hurt\" reactions. Highly recommend couples counseling to address this issue.", "NTA He is using your emotions against you, he is emotionally abusing you. You might have kids togheter but this relation is not healthy, You maybe should divorce him if he refuses to change. His behavior is manipulative and really wrong. He broke your trust and you is the one to apologize?! You should never apologize for you own feelings and thoughts!", "NTA.  At all.", "NTA and its your thoughts!! I'm sure all of his thoughts about you, your marriage etc. aren't always great and if you knew them you would be upset as well, but he doesn't write his down. Maybe you need to buy a safe and lock it away and do not leave the combo anywhere.", "NTA But damn, your husband is. I had an ex read my journal. Holy breach of trust. The relationship didn\u2019t recover and there were admittedly other factors. But zero regrets leaving that ex in the rear view. \n\nIn short, journals are PRIVATE unless you give explicit permission to read it. If he isn\u2019t trustworthy enough to not read, what else can\u2019t you trust?", "NTA. Don\u2019t you dare apologize for anything that was written. It wasn\u2019t written for him, it wasn\u2019t written to be read. He absolutely has thoughts that would hurt you if you had access to them, the difference is you don\u2019t. \n\nHe knows full well not to read it and I\u2019m willing to bet he has read it more than the 3 times you know about given the fact he straight out said \u201cI read your diary.\u201d \n\nIn your position\u2026 I won\u2019t lie, I would be pretty tempted to throw down an ultimatum- couples therapy or divorce, and if I ever found out it happened again straight to divorce. \n\nYou apologizing in the past validated his feelings of entitlement to your private thoughts and feelings. This time if he gets sad \u201cwell that\u2019s what you get for reading things that are none of your business.\u201d If he tries to bring up anything he read, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, I\u2019ve never raised that with you and until I do it\u2019s not a problem because it\u2019s a private thought that you violated and don\u2019t have any right to feel anything about.\u201d", "NTA.   1 to 10, 10 for reading someone's  diary.

You should reconsider a divorce", "So at base, he is saying:  stop deflecting back to the thing I am deflecting away from. How dare you ?!!   Don't apologise for a thing. Take back all the previous apologies. NTA.", "NTA, but you need to understand what this means. He does not think you deserve any privacy. He does not respect your boundaries. He is willing to go behind your back and find out whatever he wants to fit his narrative and make you feel bad about it. Is this really the partner you want in your life moving forward?", "NTA.  And it's probably been more than three times.", "NTA. The issue is about respect. He has shown, over and over and over again, that he has no respect for your privacy, your feelings, or your thoughts. There's a saying, once in am occurrence, twice is a coincidence, and three time's a pattern. This is a pattern of disrespect. You have a right to have your own private thoughts and feelings, and the right to work them out in a diary. Frankly, he has no right to be upset. Also, look at the pattern. He habitually looks through your journal and then gets to use his invasion of privacy as a stick to beat you with. He puts you in the position of having to beg his forgiveness repeatedly. I would think really, really hard about the nature of this relationship going forward, if I were you.", "I'm inclined to say Y T A for letting it get this far and apologising to him at all. And btw it absolutely isn't the THIRD time he's done this. It's the third time he found something to be upset about. Either be honest with each other and let him roam free through your private thoughts or admit you have no privacy in your own house and get a locked box or something to hide your diary and find a method to be able to tell when he's read it. NTA", "Nta. I'd email my plan to my best friend for evidence purposes and then buy a dupe journal. Fill it with progressively angry rants about my husband reading my journal and then channel the spirits of great horror writers  and write a murder plot.

He\u2019s a manipulative AH.\n\nETA 100% he\u2018s read it even more often.", "I'll go against the norm and say you both are the AH.\n\nHim for repeatedly betraying your trust and reading your diary, which I guarantee has been more than 3 times., and yourself for not talking to him about issues. There's obviously something going on in your relationship more than just the diary and you two need to sit down and talk about it or maybe talk to a marriage councilor", "One time is a mistake.  Second and third times are a choice.  Those are your personal thoughts to vent.  NTA.", "> \"Anyway we got married\"\n\nW H Y\n\nThe whiplash I got here, smh. But massive red flags in the previous paragraphs aside... He has now violated your most personal, private space **3 times**. He is not sorry for this. He knows what a diary is and he knows you do not want him reading it. He is doing this intentionally. \n\nIdk what you wrote but frankly it doesn't matter. He has proven he 1) does not respect you or your privacy, and 2) does not trust you or your ability to separate thought from action. This is not the foundation of a healthy relationship. \n\nNTA but stop putting up with this. He will do it again. You will get angry again. He will make you feel guilty again. This cycle is messed up and you need to put a stop to it immediately.", "NTA. Your next journal entry should say that everyone on Reddit thinks he\u2019s TA for violating your privacy. See how he reacts to that. I\u2019m so mad for you!", "It\u2019s bad enough that he read it - 5/10 the first time, 10/10 the other two times. \n\nBut then after being 100% in the wrong for reading your journal he manipulates apologies out of you for having those thoughts and make you feel\nguilty for the way those thoughts, that he essentially stole from you, made him feel? That\u2019s 11/10 and it\u2019s too bad you always had kids with this guy. \n\nSince you already married him and had kids, maybe start locking up your journal if you\u2019re planning to stick around. He will never, never stop doing this. NTA.", "I'm thinking that you allowed him to continue to do this. \n\nWhen people show you who they are, believe them.", "NTA. He sucks.  If you go snooping, you\u2019ll find more than you bargained for sometimes. His behavior is unacceptable.  I\u2019d want to get away from him so badly. Ugh.", "NTA he's violated your privacy REPEATEDLY and he can go kick rocks.", "NTA. Realizing what it was and continuing to read it (multiple times) was bad enough, but passive-aggressively guilting you about it makes it even worse.", "NTA.  If there is any way you're an ah here, it's by not paying attention when he showed you while you were dating that he doesn't respect your privacy, nor your right to have your own thoughts and feelings.", "NTA-  your husband don\u2019t respect you and your boundaries.  He read your diary he promised he wouldn\u2019t do and then get upset with you and you apologizing for it.  Just stop apologizing for it and let him know 3 strikes and your out!  I\u2019m done not being able to trust you anymore.", "ESH. Knowing a person has no sense of privacy or boundaries, act accordingly. Hide your shit. Also, cooperating with emotional blackmail. His assholery is obvious, breaking obvious universal boundaries, sneaking around, failing to keep his promises, and a truly unbecoming degree of spinning out over stuff that has nothing to do with him (in at least the earlier instances). This person needs to be introduced to the concept of 'fuck around and find out' and invited to stop fucking around. Journal reading is a 9 on at least non-violent terribleness, and no of course you don't apologize, you can do whatever you want in your own head, and a journal is an extension of the inside of your head.", "Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. How many more times is he going to get angry at the things you write before you accept he reads your journal deliberately and consistently? ESH because you both bear responsibility for this repeated situation escalating to the point you had kids in a relationship where you demonstrate violating privacy is what love looks & feels like.", "Yeah he has absolutely read it regularly, whenever he has been able to find it.", "I have to ask; why did you marry him after he has repeated shown that he doesn't respect your privacy?  You are NTA   and you aren't over reacting, but you deserve respect and common decency from your partner, not.. whatever this foolishness is.", "There\u2019s no way he doesn\u2019t read it every chance he gets. He\u2019s just been blatant about these times being offended", "I would bet a significant amount of money that any well encrypted and password protected digital file labeled as 'diary' would get *accidentally* deleted by the dear husband - out of spite that he no longer has access to her most private thoughts.\n\nWould love to hear an update about what happens to a random encrypted file named \"Diary 2022\" if she leaves it where he might see it on their PC/Laptop...", "Like wasn't the first time enough red flag? If someone finds my dairy and keeps reading it then they ain't the one", "This is a good suggestion. \u2b06\ufe0f\n\nI\u2019m so sorry OP that you are dealing with this. Please find a secure place for your diary/journal AND PLEASE find a way to get into some therapy or counseling for yourself. You need to get stronger for yourself and your children. \n\nThis man is not a good partner. At all.  This is his third (known) strike. He needs to be out. But you need to be stronger to do it. You are still doubting yourself. Please help yourself!", "It\u2019s also potentially a place where a person gets to overreact and then self evaluate. I\u2019m not saying OP has done this, but it is something I have done in the past. So a Private journal isn\u2019t a good jumping off point for a discussion. Many times it\u2019s an emotional outlet for someone to sort out complicated feelings first.", "Ho it's not the first time i hear about that. The boyfriend of a very good friend read her diary, then HE TOOK NOTES about it, and basically slut-shamed her for having casual sex with a guy BEFORE they even met. She forgave him too....", "Uhh, NOT forgivable no matter how many times.", "For real. He reads it at least weekly if not more often.\n\nOP, you might want to revisit that divorce idea.", "I'm with everybody who thinks he's been doing it all along. This type of violation of trust and of privacy is beyond disrespect, all the way to contempt. Judging her for her private thoughts is completely unacceptable.\n\nThis is a doomed marriage, and finding a way to secure the diary won't fix it. It's the underlying issues of contempt, attempted thought control, and lack of respect for her autonomy/privacy that are the insurmountable problems. OP, you're NTA, but you're hitched to one.", "Oof", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "We blame victims too right? I need to start hiding my shit cos my partner cannot respect my boundary and that makes me suck right? My home must be lit", "He waits to find something to be mad at her about before admitting to it but I can guarantee he\u2019s been reading it the entire time.", "The diary is secondary. The lack of respect to go into someone's most private thoughts and feelings and then punish them for it? And you marry him AFTER THIS?? then he does it again and you have KIDS with this guy? Jesus, OP. Not blaming you but these red flags were there for a long time. Get out. If you think he's only done it three times to you, you're being foolish.", "Exactly. He was bound to get upset, totally his own fault", "The amount of bs we as human race will put up with is shocking.", "Fixed. Thank you."]}
