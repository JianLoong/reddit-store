{"id": 1537, "submission_id": "ymrt2u", "title": "AITA for insisting that I have nothing to apologize for after my husband read my diary?", "selftext": "I'm trying to stay focused here but my edibles have kicked in and I need advice.\n\nI have kept a diary since I was 10. It is my form of therapy, & I do not police my thoughts. I have never let anyone read my diary. \n\nMy husband & I started dating over a decade ago. One day a couple of months in, he was over at my apartment, & I had hopped in the shower. When I came out, he was sitting on the bed shell-shocked. He said he read my journal, which was mostly about my life as a newly single woman. He told me it really stung to read all that. \n\n*\"But wait. Hold on. How'd you find it?\"*\n\nHe said he was looking for matches. He couldn't tell me why he kept reading even after he knew what it was, but his apology was sincere & I forgave him. Not too long after that, things got messy. He started getting either very sad or very angry while referring to things he read. His feelings were so intense that I STARTED APOLOGIZING FOR MY THOUGHTS. \n\nAnyway, we got married. \n\nA decade later, I was thinking of a divorce & wrote a ton to process my thoughts about some sensitive topics. Again, he \"stumbled\" upon my journal & read it all. I was pissed, but he convinced me that he would never do it again. Besides, he was really hurt by the things I wrote, and I felt bad. I let it go, but he started getting sad or angry again thinking about what he had read. Once more, the intensity of his feelings led me to apologize for my thoughts.\n\nNow here we are, married with kids, setting up Scrabble on a Friday night. He went to find a piece of paper & came back quiet & distracted. I asked if everything was okay. He looked at me sharply & told me that he just read my journal. I tensed, thinking of how I recently tackled some tough feelings related to our different ethnic & religious backgrounds. I wrote things that would have been hurtful to read, & I was mortified knowing that he did read them, but I was also annoyed. \n\n*\"Wait. You read my journal again?\"*\n\nHe blamed me for leaving it out & accused me of being a bad person for what I wrote but honestly I wasn't listening to him anymore. I just wanted to know why we were dealing with this again. It's pretty fucking basic knowledge that one shouldn't read other people's diaries, right? But look at him, forcing his way into my brain & shaming me for what he saw. I surprised myself by slamming my hand on the table. \n\n*\"A THIRD TIME??\"* \n\nWe were both hurt, but he was accusing me of overreacting while minimizing and deflecting from his behavior. He called me \"overly emotional\" when I cried over how violated I felt. This feels so wrong, like I committed a thoughtcrime. \n\nSo AITA for insisting he's 100% wrong? I'm so mad, but I am doubting whether my reaction was proportional to what he did. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being terrible), what would you rate someone reading your journal? & would you apologize for the things you wrote?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your comments. I am overwhelmed. For those suggesting therapy, I have been in it for a long time, and I credit it for listening to the little voice in my head instead of ignoring it. Therapy gave me the insight to see what he was doing in real time.  \n\nBut to those saying YTA and ESH, all I can say is that this type of behavior has been normalized so much for me, and I have been gaslit for so long, that I automatically convinced myself it wasn't *that bad*. I feel like I'm emerging from the upside-down, and I have to relearn basic social norms. You have no idea how sad all of this makes me.", "created_utc": 1667649153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymrt2u/aita_for_insisting_that_i_have_nothing_to/", "score": 1301, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has broken your trust 3 times, and after the first time knew that he might not like what you had written. Sounds like he uses reading your journal as a way to understand how you\u2019re feeling, rather than actually asking you. The whole point of a journal is that you get to articulate your feelings, unedited, in a private place. He has disrespected that on 3 separate occasions. If he didn\u2019t want to be upset by what he read, he shouldn\u2019t have read it", "NTA. He\u2019s had his 3 strikes; he\u2019s out.", "NTA. He basically did the equivalent of listening at the door of a therapy session. Everyone thinks things that they would never say out loud. It's his fault he keeps going and searching for your journal. If you stay with him I'd get a safe that uses your fingerprint or something. He clearly will do it again.", "NTA.\n\nThis is the same as someone eavesdropping on therapy sessions. You're allowed to feel the things you do and he's breaching your trust in a major way.", "NTA. He is 100% in the wrong. Totally on him and him only. He could be visible on the table and he still should be able to not read it.

Cos it just doesn't seem like something that he just starts up doing again after a decade after having not done it the whole time. Seems kinda like a habit to him, that he still doesn't see anythinng wrong with. So why would he have actually stopped?\n\nAlso seems a little coincedental that he just happened to read it these rare few times which happened to also be times he read something that upset him.\n\nHe's 100% wrong. For the *third time* (that you know of).\n\nYou're allowed to have uncomplimentary and negative thoughts about your relationship, and to write them down in a place he is never supposed to see. If he doesn't have the respect or the self control not to read your journal he can hardly complain when it sometimes contains bad things about him, but most of all he just really must have that respect. And he has shown that he doesn't, repeatedly. And then has the gall to act like you've wronged him. Gah.", "NTA. I can't believe he blamed you for reading your diary...", "NTA. \n\nFrankly I don't understand why you would continue  dating someone who proved he couldn't be trusted not to snoop through your possessions and had the audacity to complain about what you've written in your PRIVATE journal. But, you chose to stay in for 10 years, got married, had kids. If you plan on staying in the marriage, you need to accept your man has proven his word isn't his bond. His righteous indignation is a false flag. He's trying to make you feel terrible for your PRIVATE thoughts. He is the one who should be apologizing. Stand your ground on this. Point out to him that everyone has negative thoughts about their lives along with the people in them and that you know he does it too. The difference is most people don't put their thoughts to paper. He had no right to poke his nose into your personal brain droppings and, if he wants to remain angry, he only has himself to blame for an unethical action, invasion of privacy. \n\nThen, buy yourself a lockbox that he can't break into (padlock with combo he can't guess) and store your journal in it. If he gets angry about it, tell him it's too bad you had to go to great lengths like this because he's proven he can't be trusted.", "NTA. Reading someone\u2019s diary it a huge breach of privacy. I would definitely rate that a 10.", "NTA.  I view this as a 10. And this is not the third time.", "NTA\n\nBut this is who this man is. He's shown a consistent pattern of disrespecting your clearly stated boundaries, and he will continue to do so.\n\nDon't be surprised when he does it a fourth, fifth, sixth time.", "NTA.  Does he realize he's creating the problem, not you?  It's almost like he sees your diary as a way to find reasons to get upset.  Who does that?!  I'd be so mad also if I were you... and I'd absolutely stop apologizing.  You have done nothing wrong and yet he continues to violate your privacy.", "You are absolutely NTA. Your husband is. Everyone knows what is in a diary is personal and shouldn't be read by anyone. I my have forgiven him the first time, but definitely not after that. Reading your diary not only shows he doesn't respect you, but shows he doesn't trust you.", "NTA. You\u2019ve made it clear that your diary is a place for all thoughts, good and bad, that are meant to be kept private.

My ex husband read my journal too. He didn't like what he read (he cheated, I had a lot of thoughts about it) but he shouldn't have looked in the first place. He did it to himself. Its a 10 on the scale of terribleness imo. I can't even keep a journal now because I'm so paranoid that my current partner might come across it.", "I\u2019m not sure why you let it get to a third time without securing your journals. But NTA for not apologizing to him getting his feeling hurt by reading your journal. He A) is the one that made you feel that way to begin with and B) is the one who chose to expose himself you your unfiltered thoughts will fill knowledge that you didn\u2019t want him to. Get a lock box.", "NTA. Not at all. He repeatedly disrespects and invades your privacy. Everyone deserves privacy to work through their shit. You can't be honest when you have to worry about someone invading your space.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. Your journal is clearly your way of processing your feelings. Even if you write in the moment, something that is an overreaction, that is your way of processing and grounding yourself. It does not sound like you are sharing these journals with anyone else so while I can understand that your spouse would be upset they he is reading about himself in a negative light, he also needs to realize after all this time that this is your way of processing mental struggles", "NTA.  He has a problem trusting you, obviously. Unfortunately, it seems pretty deeply seated in him since it's been going on for so long; I'd be unsurprised if it turns out he reads your diary regularly and only admits to it when he has these \"hurt\" reactions. Highly recommend couples counseling to address this issue.", "NTA He is using your emotions against you, he is emotionally abusing you. You might have kids togheter but this relation is not healthy, You maybe should divorce him if he refuses to change. His behavior is manipulative and really wrong. He broke your trust and you is the one to apologize?! You should never apologize for you own feelings and thoughts!", "NTA.  At all.", "NTA and its your thoughts!! I'm sure all of his thoughts about you, your marriage etc. aren't always great and if you knew them you would be upset as well, but he doesn't write his down. Maybe you need to buy a safe and lock it away and do not leave the combo anywhere.", "NTA But damn, your husband is. I had an ex read my journal. Holy breach of trust. The relationship didn\u2019t recover and there were admittedly other factors. But zero regrets leaving that ex in the rear view. \n\nIn short, journals are PRIVATE unless you give explicit permission to read it. If he isn\u2019t trustworthy enough to not read, what else can\u2019t you trust?", "NTA. Don\u2019t you dare apologize for anything that was written. It wasn\u2019t written for him, it wasn\u2019t written to be read. He absolutely has thoughts that would hurt you if you had access to them, the difference is you don\u2019t. \n\nHe knows full well not to read it and I\u2019m willing to bet he has read it more than the 3 times you know about given the fact he straight out said \u201cI read your diary.\u201d \n\nIn your position\u2026 I won\u2019t lie, I would be pretty tempted to throw down an ultimatum- couples therapy or divorce, and if I ever found out it happened again straight to divorce. \n\nYou apologizing in the past validated his feelings of entitlement to your private thoughts and feelings. This time if he gets sad \u201cwell that\u2019s what you get for reading things that are none of your business.\u201d If he tries to bring up anything he read, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, I\u2019ve never raised that with you and until I do it\u2019s not a problem because it\u2019s a private thought that you violated and don\u2019t have any right to feel anything about.\u201d", "NTA.   1 to 10, 10 for reading someone's  diary.  Reading it a third time....1,000\n\nPeople tell their feelings to a therapist, you write  in a diary.  You need  a better hiding spot.\nHe's an asshole", "Buy a small safe...keep journal on there... combo lock, no key.  NTA", "NTA. You should reconsider a divorce", "So at base, he is saying:  stop deflecting back to the thing I am deflecting away from. How dare you ?!!   Don't apologise for a thing. Take back all the previous apologies. NTA.", "NTA, but you need to understand what this means. He does not think you deserve any privacy. He does not respect your boundaries. He is willing to go behind your back and find out whatever he wants to fit his narrative and make you feel bad about it. Is this really the partner you want in your life moving forward?", "NTA.  And it's probably been more than three times.", "NTA. The issue is about respect. He has shown, over and over and over again, that he has no respect for your privacy, your feelings, or your thoughts. There's a saying, once in am occurrence, twice is a coincidence, and three time's a pattern. This is a pattern of disrespect. You have a right to have your own private thoughts and feelings, and the right to work them out in a diary. Frankly, he has no right to be upset. Also, look at the pattern. He habitually looks through your journal and then gets to use his invasion of privacy as a stick to beat you with. He puts you in the position of having to beg his forgiveness repeatedly. I would think really, really hard about the nature of this relationship going forward, if I were you.", "I'm inclined to say Y T A for letting it get this far and apologising to him at all. And btw it absolutely isn't the THIRD time he's done this. It's the third time he found something to be upset about. Either be honest with each other and let him roam free through your private thoughts or admit you have no privacy in your own house and get a locked box or something to hide your diary and find a method to be able to tell when he's read it.

Fill it with progressively angry rants about my husband reading my journal and then channel the spirits of great horror writers  and write a murder plot.

Neither of which are divorce...yet, though that's up to you.\n\n1) A lockable box or personal safe. Make it known to him that you will be keeping your \"evil journal\" away from him this way and from now on he'll be safe from your inner turmoil.

Frankly, at this point it's like a child touching the element on a stove and being shocked they got burned, and then going back only to cry about how that element shouldn't be hot in the first place. At some point the man needs to learn to avoid  it or at least admit he's trying to police you.\n\nHonestly...I'm being hella charitable in this post, but people say \"suggesting divorce\" is too common and quick on this site, and admittedly divorce can be messier than what I've suggested.\n\nNTA", "He's been reading it the whole time.
