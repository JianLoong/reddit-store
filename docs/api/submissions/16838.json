We have been together for two years and he also has two children (6F and 4M)  from his previous relationship with his high school sweetheart. For some context, the children live with us full time because their mother abandoned them 3 years ago to pursue her own ambitions. Now, I am currently 5 months pregnant with my first biological child (a boy) and am excited for his arrival. However, for some time now I have noticed my fianc\u00e9 has not been holding his own weight in our relationship, to put it bluntly. For example, I do the majority of house chores like sweeping, mopping, laundry, cooking, grocery shopping, etc. Granted I had given him some slack because he was in an accident earlier this year which took a couple months to recover from, but it was an issue before that. There\u2019s other things like only me waking up in the middle of the night when one of the kids has a fever or when our 4 year old sometimes has accidents, to change sheets and clean him up. Even when I had been sick multiple times with strep or sinus infections. At first he\u2019d say he understands and will try to do better, but it only lasted a few days then it was back to the same habits. My mom and grandma love about an hour and a half away and they asked if i could stay with one of them after I give birth so they could take care of me during the first month of postpartum. This will be my moms first grandchild and my grandmothers first great-grand child. In my culture, it is common for the women in the family to take care of the new mother to help with healing, breastfeeding and bonding with the new baby. I loved the idea so I brought it up with my fianc\u00e9 and he was upset. He said it wasn\u2019t fair that he would have to travel that far just to see his son. I tried explaining to him that during that time I honestly don\u2019t feel like I would have any time to heal between the two kids, a new born, and postpartum, I feel like I wouldn\u2019t get the necessary help i would desperately need. He became even more visibly upset and said that I didn\u2019t trust him and has been sulking ever since our conversation. Im torn between sucking it up and giving him the benefit of the doubt to prove he could be the support I need or just leaving and not taking the chance.

If I were in your shoes, I'd strongly consider taking a break from someone who is sulking for an extended length of time when all you did was attempt to make plans for the best way to care for *his* child.

It sounds like you have essentially been raising his kids for him. If I were you, I would run far away from him.\n\nAlso, it's super sweet for your family to offer to take care of you!

It\u2019s no surprise his ex left if he treated her like he treats you. Go stay with your mom. He\u2019s the kids\u2019 dad, he needs to step up.

But he didn't so here you are, with the consequences of *his* actions. So if he really wants you to stay *he* is the one that needs to prove it through more than empty promises and sulking.

Go be with people who will care for you.", "NTA  Go. He's sulking because all he can see is having to take care of his own kids. If you cave you'll be tasked with everything plus the baby.

Given his behavior I'm pretty sure I know why girlfriend #1 ran away.", "NTA, you may want to go sooner.  I see so many red flags here.  You are doing all the housework, you are the one that takes care of his kids, you are doing all the cooking, all of this while you are pregnant and while you were very sick as well.

If so, why?", "NTA I would tell him he had from now until the birth to show that he can change or you\u2019ll stay with your mom. I did the same when my youngest was born. My oldest was still getting up once a week or so (he was 3 when his sister was born) and I told my husband when I was 6 months pregnant that he needed to start getting up Queen oldest got up in the middle of the night or oldest and I would stay with my mom for awhile so I could get used to having 2 kids. He started getting up, he hated it and complained once in awhile (which I was fine with cause I complained about it too) but he did it cause he knew it\u2019s what I needed.", "NAH. It's fair for your husband to want to be with his child. It would be difficult on the children, too, to be \"abandoned\" by the woman they see as their mother and not get to see their new sibling. At the same time, childbirth and postpartum are difficult - physically and emotionally. Some cultures do a better job of acknowledging that and supporting the new mom than others. I feel for your choices here. I don't think you have any ideal options and hope you have peace in whatever you decide to do.", "your husband has short comings but to take a newborn away for a month could really impact his mental health. Men can get post-partum depression and separation anxiety too you know!  (been there done that nearly lost my life in the process)", "I mean, it IS pretty shitty to take your kid an hour and a half away from their dad instead of working out an alternate solution but you gotta do what you gotta do if you can\u2019t rely on him as a partner.\n\nThis is probably gonna cause irreparable harm in your relationship though. I\u2019d probably try to get counseling before going for this nuclear option.", "Info:  How would you feel if after giving birth your husband said he's taking the baby and he'll be back in a month......would you be ok with that. \n\n\nSidenote: The guy was a single father before you.....he must know how to raise children, unless you got engaged and pregnant by a man you watched be a bad father.", "Soft TA because he deserves to bond with his child that month too.

The only thing he\u2019s upset about is losing the primary parent for his other kids and having to take care of them himself for a month.

Maybe the month will be a good reality check for him to get his act together. You need the help, go to where you\u2019ll have the help.", "This probably won\u2019t be a popular opinion here. I don\u2019t think YWBTA because you do have to prioritize yourself and your new baby during this time. I think you should also take his feelings into account though. Your baby\u2019s first month will be a super hard time, but it will also be miraculous. I think you should consider that IF he can be supportive and make you feel safe it would be a wonderful bonding experience for you and him, as a couple, and you all as a family. That first month after my son was born was so important for major growth in our marriage and made us stronger as a couple. I think you should attempt to have a serious conversation with him about what you need from him so you feel safe and secure with him. He has four months to show you. I would start with planning a nice long pre-birth visit with your family. It is important now that you take care of yourself and it sounds like being around your wonderful mom and grandma would be a good start. He can step up and show that he can run the household smoothly without your help. If he is not wanting to do everything he can to make you, the woman carrying his baby, feel supported and secure and to trust him, than that is your answer about the month after birth and maybe beyond, because it won\u2019t magically change after if it doesn\u2019t change now. Couples therapy might be a great idea for you two, you\u2019re both young and have so much responsibility with soon to be three young ones, talking to a professional might really help you too communicate and build trust. Either way, congratulations on your son, holding your baby in your arms for the first time is an emotional and precious moment. Protect it and do what makes you feel safe.", "He was a single father for at least a year before OP. Shouldn't that be proof?", "Honestly he already showed her who he was when he made his children her responsibility.\n\nLet's be real, if he's not even doing the heavy lifting with his older children he sure as he'll won't be any help with this baby.", "This is exactly what I thought. I don't understand why she doesn't just say no when he wakes her up to take care of his children", "NTA but you should have right sized this long before getting pregnant.", "Right who would want to be with someone who complains that their new born will be away from them for the month. Over there being upset dating \"but I want to be with my child\" he better learn about tradition dammit", "Really. You want her to do even more work creating a detailed chore chart and then making sure to present it with a happy heart (puke) to soothe her husband, who is a grown man, so that he\u2019ll maybe be coddled gently enough to start doing the actual bare minimum of what he should be doing anyways? Fuck no. The family is already built. He\u2019s already shown her how he is. She needs to do what\u2019s best for her and if he wants to be a part of it then it\u2019s on him to change, not her to change him.", "I have considered it but we don\u2019t have much space plus she still works a full time job. At least if I was with her, my grandmother is retired and lives like 5 minutes away from her so she\u2019d easily be able to drop by as well.", "He can\u2019t have it both ways.

Probably not.", "I mean the easy solution would be to her mom stay at the house with them.", "She has told him and he isn't listening", "No it isn't. Anyone who gives birth deserves actual support during their recovery period. If he isn't supportive enough as a parent now and that makes staying with the mom the more practical solution for OP, that's on him. Not OP.", "No. He needs to prove he is capable of doing everything even when there is an available adult female in the household.", "He married her for a Bangmaid. And free childcare. Now he\u2019s calling the Wahhhmbulance, because he doesn\u2019t get everything his way. Ugh.", "I mean, all we know for sure is that he didn't neglect the kids badly enough to get them taken off him by the government. Which is a pretty low bar, really. \n\nAs others have said, just because he can, that doesn't mean he will if there's someone who can do it for him. When it comes to childcare, the buck stops with the person who cares the most, which may not be him.", "I'm going to assume you genuinely want an answer.\n\nThe issue isn't proving that he *can* take care of his kids if he has no other choice. The issue is proving that he will *voluntarily* do his fair share of the childcare even though he has someone he can easily unload it on. \n\nIf he will only care for *his* children when OP is actively nagging him, that means he has put OP into the role of \"household manager\" and sees his role as \"occasional helper\"...this is often the kind of thing people are talking about when they use the phrase \"weaponized incompetence\"\n\nNow, is it possible for us to tell for sure what is happening from the few paragraphs posted? No, of course not. Is it highly concerning that his behavior so closely resembles what he would do if he was using a weaponized incompetence strategy? Yes.", "My brother was a stellar single father.

It's a strategy that has worked quite well for me in life: occasionally, people make substantive changes to their behavior (which solves the underlying problem), and the AHs inevitably prove themselves beyond a shadow of a doubt, so then I'm not left wondering if I was too hasty in my judgment.\n\nBut since this isn't an advice sub, OP gets my judgment that she's NTA regardless of whether she's interested in using my sample text or not \ud83d\ude0a", "Get grandma to come and your mom on weekends", "So question do you feel parents who adopt are less than real moms. \n\nBecause that's what's your saying he's less of a parent because he didn't go through child birth right\n\nEdit to add: why respond and block so that I can't respond to the comment smh", "The thing is we're thinking of two different beds. \n\nThe bed you think it's better is OP leaving with their child so he can't see his child grow in that first month. \n\nThe bed I think he should be in is picking up all the house work and childcare for the other two kids while OP recovers.", "Where does OP say she's actually ending the relationship over this, though? Like, it'd be different if she was saying that she was considering leaving him for these things. THAT makes sense. Saying you're going to leave for the first month your child is alive to essentially punishing their father for not doing more is just childish. I'm also curious what the division of working time and bills is between them", "That depends on the contribution to the partnership said partner brings herself.

Having a child is a choice.", "That is an entirely different pair of shoes.", "If she just had a baby she won't be an available adult female though right?", "So after reading this you're telling OP  there's no way this man loves her and only uses her for sex and to clean.

He just has to put extra time and effort into seeing the kid and in his mind that seems to mean he won't see the kid. After childbirth is when moms need time to recover and dad's need to put in the extra effort to do what moms need.\n\nHe's not interested in that, he's just upset that her having what she needs to recover is inconvenient for him.", "His physical needs are less important than her physical needs immediately after she\u2019s given birth and I do not think that should be at all a controversial statement.", "Do you think he\u2019s going to do that? Because he\u2019s not even helping her right now let alone taking over.", "Yeah but what if she needs taking care of and he can\u2019t provide that? I agree it would suck for him to be away from his son for a month but she does need the rest to heal. If he can\u2019t help now what if he doesn\u2019t then. Some births are extremely tough and she needs to think of herself sometimes.", "Because that first month (more like 6 weeks) is when she'll need support to heal and care for the baby.

When did they start living together (only been together 2 years, so possible them living together been short and he was injured part of the time).

But if you've been the sole caretaker of these kids for 3 years (which at 6 and 4 isn't insignificant), you need to take that into consideration. I'm not saying don't, but at least acknowledge and try to meditate that as much as possible. They've had one mother figure leave, another... I just feel bad for these kids.

No. But is it fair that I will give birth and have no support? No. So you need to figure your shit out and learn how to be a parent and a partner quickly, because otherwise you'll be a single dad to two and a longer distance parent to one.\"", "NTA.

So he apparently took care of his children for a year on his own before meeting or dating you. Which means he's capable. What is his work schedule, and do you also work? If you both work I don't think your complaints are unreasonable. But if you don't work and he is the only source of income, I also don't think it's unreasonable for him to expect you to take care of the middle of the night emergencies, especially since you refer to his children as your children.

Who in this relationship works? Because if he's out working all day and you're not, I think it's quite fair for you to be the one doing most/all of the housework. Not because of gender roles, just because both members of a healthy relationship should be contributing equally. If one of you works and the other doesn't (or works less) then the other has to do more/all of the housework to keep things fair.\n\nObviously once you're *heavily* pregnant and for the first few months after the baby is born things are a bit different, just like it was different while he was recovering from his accident. That's another thing about healthy relationships - each person should pick up the slack when the other *needs* it.\n\nWithout the extra context, I don't know how much of this applies to your situation. But if either of you has a problem with the idea that each of you should contribute equally, then they need to do some growing up ASAP because you guys already have kids and you're about to have another, so you can't afford to be kids yourselves.", "NTA but at the same time the fact you want to do this doesn't bode well for the relationship and I feel for him that his interaction/bonding with his new child will be limited because of this, to be honest there issues you guys are having should have been resolved before you have a child together", "I feel like maybe there is some middle ground here?\n\nWhere your mom and grandma can help you out, but also your husband doesn\u2019t miss out on the first month of his child\u2019s life?

I also noticed there is no mention of jobs, does he work full time is this why a majority of the housework falls to you? He should definitely be helping with nighttime issues, especially if a new baby is coming, but I\u2019m just wondering cause from your post it seems he doesn\u2019t work. If he works full time and you are a Sahm then I get the daily chores falling mostly on yourself, but if he\u2019s home then that is a whole different story. For myself personally with the kids having been with you soley as the mother figure do you not feel sad leaving them, cause of you are viewing this as \u201cI\u2019m having my own child now\u201d then maybe this relationship is not for you, cause I\u2019d fair you would start treating them that way.

You should be at home after the delivery and he should pull his weight.  So yes YTA if you go to Mom for a month.

What if she did precisely that? My own \"father\" did exactly that - he abandoned us to pursue his own ambitions (worked out *really* well for him, lemme tell ya). I'm not scared to say that he did that, because... well... he literally did. It's very possible that the kids' bio mom did the same thing. Assholishness doesn't discriminate between which parent is a deadbeat. I'm leaning toward OP's account of the mom because even if she left him for his incompetence, she really had to abandon her kids, too? They're not at fault of anything... their father is. If she knew exactly how useless her ex is, why would she leave her beloved children with him? It shows her priorities, in my opinion.\n\nLeave the SO; don't abandon the kids. It's not their fault. No matter which way you slice it, she prioritized herself over her children. They're innocent in this; they don't deserve to be abandoned by either parent. And I guarantee you that this'll affect them later in life.\n\nIf I'm honest, I'd actually be rather offended if someone defended my \"father\" like that, by saying that it's gross how I speak about how he abandoned us for his own benefit as it's 100% true.
