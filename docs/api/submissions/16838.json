We have been together for two years and he also has two children (6F and 4M)  from his previous relationship with his high school sweetheart. For some context, the children live with us full time because their mother abandoned them 3 years ago to pursue her own ambitions. Now, I am currently 5 months pregnant with my first biological child (a boy) and am excited for his arrival. However, for some time now I have noticed my fianc\u00e9 has not been holding his own weight in our relationship, to put it bluntly. For example, I do the majority of house chores like sweeping, mopping, laundry, cooking, grocery shopping, etc. Granted I had given him some slack because he was in an accident earlier this year which took a couple months to recover from, but it was an issue before that. There\u2019s other things like only me waking up in the middle of the night when one of the kids has a fever or when our 4 year old sometimes has accidents, to change sheets and clean him up. Even when I had been sick multiple times with strep or sinus infections. At first he\u2019d say he understands and will try to do better, but it only lasted a few days then it was back to the same habits. My mom and grandma love about an hour and a half away and they asked if i could stay with one of them after I give birth so they could take care of me during the first month of postpartum. This will be my moms first grandchild and my grandmothers first great-grand child. In my culture, it is common for the women in the family to take care of the new mother to help with healing, breastfeeding and bonding with the new baby. I loved the idea so I brought it up with my fianc\u00e9 and he was upset. He said it wasn\u2019t fair that he would have to travel that far just to see his son. I tried explaining to him that during that time I honestly don\u2019t feel like I would have any time to heal between the two kids, a new born, and postpartum, I feel like I wouldn\u2019t get the necessary help i would desperately need. He became even more visibly upset and said that I didn\u2019t trust him and has been sulking ever since our conversation. Im torn between sucking it up and giving him the benefit of the doubt to prove he could be the support I need or just leaving and not taking the chance.

He started getting up, he hated it and complained once in awhile (which I was fine with cause I complained about it too) but he did it cause he knew it\u2019s what I needed.", "NAH. It's fair for your husband to want to be with his child. It would be difficult on the children, too, to be \"abandoned\" by the woman they see as their mother and not get to see their new sibling. At the same time, childbirth and postpartum are difficult - physically and emotionally. Some cultures do a better job of acknowledging that and supporting the new mom than others. I feel for your choices here. I don't think you have any ideal options and hope you have peace in whatever you decide to do.", "your husband has short comings but to take a newborn away for a month could really impact his mental health.

Maybe the month will be a good reality check for him to get his act together. You need the help, go to where you\u2019ll have the help.", "This probably won\u2019t be a popular opinion here. I don\u2019t think YWBTA because you do have to prioritize yourself and your new baby during this time. I think you should also take his feelings into account though. Your baby\u2019s first month will be a super hard time, but it will also be miraculous. I think you should consider that IF he can be supportive and make you feel safe it would be a wonderful bonding experience for you and him, as a couple, and you all as a family. That first month after my son was born was so important for major growth in our marriage and made us stronger as a couple. I think you should attempt to have a serious conversation with him about what you need from him so you feel safe and secure with him. He has four months to show you. I would start with planning a nice long pre-birth visit with your family. It is important now that you take care of yourself and it sounds like being around your wonderful mom and grandma would be a good start. He can step up and show that he can run the household smoothly without your help. If he is not wanting to do everything he can to make you, the woman carrying his baby, feel supported and secure and to trust him, than that is your answer about the month after birth and maybe beyond, because it won\u2019t magically change after if it doesn\u2019t change now. Couples therapy might be a great idea for you two, you\u2019re both young and have so much responsibility with soon to be three young ones, talking to a professional might really help you too communicate and build trust. Either way, congratulations on your son, holding your baby in your arms for the first time is an emotional and precious moment. Protect it and do what makes you feel safe.", "He was a single father for at least a year before OP. Shouldn't that be proof?", "Honestly he already showed her who he was when he made his children her responsibility.\n\nLet's be real, if he's not even doing the heavy lifting with his older children he sure as he'll won't be any help with this baby.", "This is exactly what I thought. I don't understand why she doesn't just say no when he wakes her up to take care of his children", "NTA but you should have right sized this long before getting pregnant.", "Right who would want to be with someone who complains that their new born will be away from them for the month. Over there being upset dating \"but I want to be with my child\" he better learn about tradition dammit", "Really. You want her to do even more work creating a detailed chore chart and then making sure to present it with a happy heart (puke) to soothe her husband, who is a grown man, so that he\u2019ll maybe be coddled gently enough to start doing the actual bare minimum of what he should be doing anyways? Fuck no. The family is already built. He\u2019s already shown her how he is. She needs to do what\u2019s best for her and if he wants to be a part of it then it\u2019s on him to change, not her to change him.", "I have considered it but we don\u2019t have much space plus she still works a full time job.

Probably not.", "I mean the easy solution would be to her mom stay at the house with them.", "She has told him and he isn't listening", "No it isn't. Anyone who gives birth deserves actual support during their recovery period.

When it comes to childcare, the buck stops with the person who cares the most, which may not be him.", "I'm going to assume you genuinely want an answer.\n\nThe issue isn't proving that he *can* take care of his kids if he has no other choice. The issue is proving that he will *voluntarily* do his fair share of the childcare even though he has someone he can easily unload it on. \n\nIf he will only care for *his* children when OP is actively nagging him, that means he has put OP into the role of \"household manager\" and sees his role as \"occasional helper\"...this is often the kind of thing people are talking about when they use the phrase \"weaponized incompetence\"\n\nNow, is it possible for us to tell for sure what is happening from the few paragraphs posted? No, of course not. Is it highly concerning that his behavior so closely resembles what he would do if he was using a weaponized incompetence strategy? Yes.", "My brother was a stellar single father.

It's a strategy that has worked quite well for me in life: occasionally, people make substantive changes to their behavior (which solves the underlying problem), and the AHs inevitably prove themselves beyond a shadow of a doubt, so then I'm not left wondering if I was too hasty in my judgment.\n\nBut since this isn't an advice sub, OP gets my judgment that she's NTA regardless of whether she's interested in using my sample text or not \ud83d\ude0a", "Get grandma to come and your mom on weekends", "So question do you feel parents who adopt are less than real moms. \n\nBecause that's what's your saying he's less of a parent because he didn't go through child birth right\n\nEdit to add: why respond and block so that I can't respond to the comment smh", "The thing is we're thinking of two different beds. \n\nThe bed you think it's better is OP leaving with their child so he can't see his child grow in that first month. \n\nThe bed I think he should be in is picking up all the house work and childcare for the other two kids while OP recovers.", "Where does OP say she's actually ending the relationship over this, though? Like, it'd be different if she was saying that she was considering leaving him for these things. THAT makes sense.
