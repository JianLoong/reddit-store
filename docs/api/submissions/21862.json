Whether it\u2019s food, trash or an item she left outback she\u2019ll say \u201cthats not mine\u201d and 8 out of 10 times our parents will believe her and make me clean it up. \n\nThe other day my sister left out her makeup palette. It was on the living room table for three days until our mom got mad and yelled for whoever it\u2019s for to pick it up. I don\u2019t wear makeup because it breaks me out and makes my face itch, mom knows this so why did she think it\u2019s mine I have no idea. I say it\u2019s my sister\u2019s but she immediately goes no it\u2019s not, I don\u2019t even wear that brand or color. So mom then tells me to pick it up and says I should know better than to leave my by stuff laying around for so long. \n\nI just look between the two of them then say ok. I pick up the palette and toss it in the trash. My sister then panics and says why would I do that. I say it\u2019s not yours, it\u2019s not moms and it\u2019s not mine so I threw it way no one wants to use mysterious makeup that just appeared in the house. My sister then digs in the trash and pulls it back out. She tells me I messed it up and that it was a gift from a close friend. I replied I thought it wasn\u2019t yours, that\u2019s when she makes a face like oh crap. Her excuse was she didn\u2019t recognize it until now, I said yeah right, she just told me to shut up and went to her room. \n\nMom tells me that I was cruel. I reminded her that my sister said it wasn\u2019t hers so I had every right to throw it way. She said since I knew it was hers I was in the wrong. She wants me to apologize and offer to buy her a new one. I don\u2019t want to do either of those things. If she truly cared about it she would have picked it up instead of saying it wasn\u2019t hers. I\u2019m also upset that mom is completely ignoring the fact the my sister lied to get out of doing something so I feel like apologizing would let her know it\u2019s ok to keep pinning stuff on me.

You are under no obligation to apologize or replace your sisters make up. If she hadn\u2019t lied, she wouldn\u2019t be suffering the consequences.

If your mother wants to talk about your \"cruelty\" (note: that's not what \"cruel\" means) in throwing it away instead of your sister's constant lying and refusal to own her mess, she's a big problem, and the problem will only get bigger as you get older.

Really teaching your sister to be honest and to clean up after herself should be your parents job, but clearly they are not doing it.

Are you supposed to be all-knowing or something that you can tell it\u2019s your sister\u2019s but your mom can\u2019t?
