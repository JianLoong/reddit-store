I think it was a good move. But, I think if it happens again I would make a bit more of a show:\n\u201cOh. Mom, is this not yours? Ok sister, it\u2019s not yours? And it\u2019s not mine. If it\u2019s not any bodies, I guess I better just throw it out\u201d. Like, really project that if your sister doesn\u2019t speak up, it goes in the garbage.", "NTA. You did a good job.", "I think this would be a case of justified AH. Was it petty? Yes. Should you have done it? Probably not. But did the sister have it coming? Oh, yes. Honestly, the biggest AH here is your parents for doing nothing about your sister's chronic lying. If they're not going to handle it, they shouldn't be surprised when you do something about it. NTA", "NTA Tell mom every time her golden child lies and you have to clean up after the little asshole it will be going in the trash from here on out. She can decide if she wants her younger daughter to be a liar and lazy or if she wants two decent kids.", "I don\u2019t like your mom", "NTA, but I have a horse in this race. When Covid hit, my city had a huge number of kids enter the foster system and because we could, we took in 5 kids (kids were sleeping on cots at the CPS offices). We\u2019ve adopted 2 sisters and are adopting 2 more who are sisters (the other girl had a mother who has since ODed and her dad just got out of prison and he still has parental rights) Anyway. I love these girls but ever single thing left out is \u201cnot mine\u201d, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it\u201d, etc. There are enough kids here that I feel like they are zebra using their strips and group size to confuse the lion who just wants the zebra to clean up after themselves.", "NTA and good job, sorry your parents make you parent your sister and teach her responsibility instead of doing it themselves like they should.", "NTA\n\nFeel free to send this link to everyone in the family, tell them not only will you not be apologizing until she does for constantly lying but you\u2019re done picking up after her shit. If they have a problem with the mess they can take it up with her. They may try to make a power move by grounding you, (just take it, but refuse to do any cleaning that wasn\u2019t a mess made specifically by you or your parents anything to do with her is off limits even if they try to make a punishment out of it). They won\u2019t ground you for life likely just for a week or two, until they get the hint that they can\u2019t intimidate, bully, or manipulate you into being mistreated for your sisters benefit. \n\nP.S. If I were you I\u2019d just go straight to your sister and tell her that it\u2019s going to keep happening, so long as she says its not hers and you know for a fact it\u2019s not yours or your moms. She\u2019ll get the point quick if she hasn\u2019t already. Btw what you did was not cruel, what was cruel: was your sister lying to shriek responsibility, and get you in trouble for something you didn\u2019t do. Your parents are just pissed you don\u2019t worship the ground she walks on like they do, and that\u2019s fucked up.\n\nP.S. 2 : Before they say \u201cwell that\u2019s what big sisters do\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be\u201d no the fuck it\u2019s not. Siblings are supposed to joke, make fun of each other, steal each other\u2019s clothes, fight over the remote, etc. IT IS NOT your responsibility to be your sisters maid and scapegoat.", "NTA. NGL, I laughed when I read what you did. Clever! \n\nI'm sorry that your parents suck. They both clearly play favorites, your mom actively and your dad passively. You say you're 17, so I hope that you can get out of there ASAP.\n\nDo NOT apologize and do NOT buy a new palette.", "NTA - as a mom, I approve of you throwing the make up out & would have died laughing as your sis dug through the trash.", "NTA - and I\u2019m an eyeshadow palette hoarder. I take care of my stuff and your sister should\u2019ve as well.", "Your mum is 100% the AH here. I got mad just reading that passage, I can\u2019t imagine living with it\u2026\n\nShe lets your sister get away with WAY too much. The moment your sister revealed the make up was hers, your Ma should have called her out for lying. No way that\u2019s on you, for calling your sister on her BS.", "NTA and please show your mother all these responses.", "What you did was wrong but at the same time she kind of did it to herself. Before anyone asks, op could have said, \"Well then I will just throw it away since it doesn't belong to anyone....\" that would have gotten a reaction out of sister as well. NTA, don't use your money to buy her a new one.", "NTA\n\nTell Mom that if you keep having to pick up stuff that isn't yours, you'll keep throwing it out.  It's Mom's fault she isn't making Sus clean up after herself.", "Nta", "NTA. Next time stomp on it and insist you believe her when she said it\u2019s not hers.", "If only her mom didn't suck this whole thing would have been awesome haha! So brilliant, but her mom didn't even care her sister lied. Screams \"golden child\" to me. NTA op", "As a parent, I have trouble understanding this.", "Yeah this is a hill I\u2019d die on. You SAID it wasn\u2019t yours. Your sister should be in trouble for lying and being lazy. How infuriating. Just keep counting the days OP, until college or whatever you plan to do at 18. \n\nNTA", "I remember getting grounded for something that happened when I wasn't even home. I was out with a friend AND HIS FAMILY at a movie. I came home and my sister had told the babysitter that I had done it, the babysitter told my parents it was me and my parents said neither of them would lie. But somehow everyone I spent all day with was not enough evidence to prove my innocence. They're currently not getting any responses to any attempt to reach out and my mental health is doing much better!", "I imagine it must be tough being the black sheep in a family of AHs.", "Right? Believe the 15 no matter what, ignoring the simple logic that OP DOES NOT WEAR MAKE UP.", "I bet even if OP said \u201cit\u2019s sisters\u201d, Mom still wouldn\u2019t believe her. Lose lose for OP.", "OP, this is the way you start adding some boundaries to your life, and I\u2019m happy that you were able to pick such a well-related consequence to your sister\u2019s lie. Hopefully she will think twice before she pulls that again, but if not, you\u2019ve got the perfect response. Breaking it when you toss it is key. She gets one shot to claim it, or it\u2019s gone. \n\nYour household sounds like it\u2019s got at least one narcissist (your mom), plus a golden child, which really is an apprentice narcissist. Read up on narcissism for more ways to cope, and understand this is not you not being enough, it\u2019s others taking advantage of you.", "Or start saying \"oh great, it must be mine, I'll go put it away in my room.\"  And then keep it.  Or if OP can't use it, regift it.", "Mum's abusive. I don't think she gives af what op wants.\n\nNTA", "Adding on, if it was a special gift from a friend, then she didn't treat it very well. She left it lying around for several DAYS, not carrying about it. If it was so special why did she treat it so poorly?", "Mother is obviously picking favorites, and sister needs her ass beat", "This. This right here.", "She needs to tell her mother, if you know it\u2019s hers and I know it\u2019s hers, why DO I HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP? If you don\u2019t want me to throw away her stuff that she lies about being hers so she doesn\u2019t have to do any cleaning, then I am not going to clean it up. Take your pick mom. Tell her to pick up her crap and put it away or it will go in the trash if you make me do it.", "Yeah, why does Mom continue to make OP the bad guy?", "Oh absolutely.\n\n\"Well, she says it isn't hers, so clearly you are a liar because she is my perfect, golden child\" \n\n-The mum, probably", "if op has a door that locks that\u2019s definitely something to try! but if mom interferes, i would just go ahead and break it and toss it in the trash. sis\u2019 future roommates will thank her.", "Preferably in front of the mom", "\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6", "Sister must be the golden child.", "Dad sucks too for going along with it. I\u2019m sorry, OP. You deserve better. NTA", "I would ask the mom for specifics when sis is not around. If sis lies could I have a guideline for what to do with her things? It has happened before and I am tired of getting blamed for her stuff and having to pick up after her when she lies. THEN OP take a picture of everything in your room on your phone to prove it is not yours and show it to mom next time she lies. And if you have to pick stuff up, photograph it and e mail it to sis and cc mum with are you sure it isnt yours? And then if she wont reply in written form throw it out oor use it or give it away. NTA but mum favours sis. Any other family to advocate for this?", "OP didn't mention a dad in the picture, but ostensibly, YES VERY."]}
