Are NTA!\n\nHere's a scenario for you, and feel free to tell it to your parents, and the rest of your family, in fact: tell the entire fucking planet if you feel the need to.\n\nI had a major break down with my (2 year old, otherwise brand new car) and I needed a vehicle DESPERATELY for work. I asked a friend to let me borrow her car until mine was fixed. FYI: The dealer said it would take 10 weeks. I told my friend I would rent it for $25 dollars a day (she had 2 other vehicles and not in a bad position to loan it, she would have to adjust what she did with another vehilce on her farm but it was not a deal breaker. and I would do all maintenance and cleaning while I used it. She not only agreed but she brought over the parts she had (extra oil, brake pads, rotors, other parts ...in case I needed them) and my husband agreed that we would return her car in better condition than when I borrowed it.\n\nThe oil change happened at 400 miles (a hundred miles early, her product, no charge to her)\n\nThe rear brake calipers were rebuilt (at no charge to her)\n\nTwo rotors replaced (no charge to her)\n\nWiper blades were replaced (no charge to her)\n\nSlow leak in two tires repaired (no charge to her)\n\nDoor molding replaced (her product and we did it as a weekend project in great weather so it was actually fun, no charge to her)\n\nEntire car was DEEP cleaned (she lives on a farm and used it for various things around there, it looked almost new as a 2018 just a few weeks ago)\n\nAir conditioning was recharged and worked perfectly (no charge to her for the coolant)\n\nAll fluids topped off, everything checked by a certified mechanic (no charge to her)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end? I borrowed that car for 2 weeks, not 10. I got very lucky that because my vehicle was in a warranty condition and put \"off road\" so the OEM put it on the top of the list. But she? Was over the moon because of all the little things she hadn't had time to get done. AND she got $350 for letting me use it. Why did we go to all that trouble and to that extent? BECAUSE SHE LOANED ME A CAR!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that? Was just a \"friend\", she wasn't family, and family should always treat family like family, not just like a friend. SO? Be angry, be judgy, be spiteful and do whatever the hell you want because these people? Did not respect you OR YOUR CAR! A car isn't just the price of a dinner, there's a LOT more involved and if you aren't capable of taking care of one you borrow?

It is not like they did it to sabotage you... they simply missed a produce from the supermarket. \n\nI'm honestly happy that they're not buying bags. Yay for the environment. \n\nBut you blew up at them over an honest mistake. And decided that you'd rather spend 180 each month rather than leave your car with your parents. \n\nCome on now... you just don't like your sibling and decided to use this opportunity to revoke their access to your car.
