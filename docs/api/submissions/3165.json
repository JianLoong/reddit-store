As a hosting gift my boyfriend wanted me to make six apple pies for his family\u2019s Thanksgiving and he insisted that I make the pies the same day we were supposed to leave for his mothers house.\n\nIn order for us to leave on time (10am) I had to wake up at 4 AM to have enough time to make all six pies, clean the apartment, get ready for dinner and for us two have plenty of time to get to his mothers house. Around 7 am I am frantic because I dropped the ball and burned the last two pies in our oven. I did not have enough flour or apples to make another two pies so I woke up my boyfriend and asked him if four pies would be enough he insisted that we needed all six pies but he refused to go to the store and get the missing ingredients I needed.\n\nThe closest supermarket to our apartment is about 5 minutes away however with it being Thanksgiving day it took me almost an hour to go to the grocery store and back. When I got home around 8:45 my boyfriend was still in bed even though I had asked him if he could help me out by getting a head start on the dishes in the kitchen. As quickly as I could I got the pies in the oven, ran to the shower and planned on doing my make up in the car. Because I was in such a rush I didn\u2019t have time to flash/pre bake the crust on the apple pie and so the pie crust sunk down and the pies came out edible but ugly. \n\nI decided to just roll with it and I put the last two pies in the decorative gift boxes, when my boyfriend got out of the shower he saw the last two pies and pointed out their defects. I apologized and told him it was a mistake but that they would still taste just as good as the other four, he asked me if I could remake them and I told him there was no way because we had to be out the door in 15 minutes. My boyfriend didn\u2019t raise his voice but got visibly upset with me and went to our bedroom to cool off for a few minutes. He came out as I was putting on my heels and told me that he would be going alone and that I was welcome to follow after I remade the last two pies.\n\nMy boyfriend left and after about 30 minutes of an intense phone call with my sister I decided I was going to spend this year\u2018s Thanksgiving alone. Obviously after a few hours I was starving so I decided to be petty and order an extravagant dinner for one on Uber eats. I got sushi, dumplings, salmon, fried rice, steak Ramen, soup, salad and I ordered ice cream from Baskin Robbins separately. When my boyfriend got home and saw all the take out he asked me how much I spent, smugly I told him probably 150 but that I wasn\u2019t paying attention when I ordered. My boyfriend got furious and we ended up getting into a huge fight about everything that happened today. Currently I am staying at a hotel not far from my job and I am wondering if I went to far, AITA?", "created_utc": 1669342787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z41acd/aita_for_ordering_ubereats_on_my_boyfriends/", "score": 423, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Every other thing he foists on you whilst he lazes in bed adds to that. He's a bellend, for sure.\n\nWhat I need more info on is the account on UberEats. Your title says its his account, yet your post makes it sound like its a joint account. This is important, because if its a joint account (ie. the account paying for it is yours and his, regardless as to who pays the most into it, so long as its joint in name) then you've done nothing wrong and simply ordered yourself a meal.\n\nBut if its as the title suggests and it is solely your boyfriend's account (ie. its his money, coming from an account in his name only) and you just happen to have access/know his password, then that's stealing. It doesn't matter if he's been an AH and you are pissed off, you don't have a right to compensate yourself by taking his money without permission.\n\nSo if its a joint account, then he's an AH and you aren't.

Go into Christmas without this sad excuse of a man jeez.", "Break up with him. Also did he take the pies with him?", "NTA he treated you like a personal baker who worked for him and not a partner and was being very selfish.

Do you really want to spend your life like this?  Who the hell makes a request like that in the first place? Let alone makes the request but can\u2019t be bothered to help with groceries.

He is not entitled to your free labor, he refused to help, then got passive aggressive and punished you for something arbitrary. \n\nAlso tally up everything you spent on the pies. Money for ingredients. At LEAST minimum wage x hours you spent making all 8 pies + the time you had to spend cleaning when he couldn't be bothered. I bet it's more than $150.", "NTA.\n\nHe went too far when he uninvited you. You spending $150 of his money was petty but I  can\u2019t blame you.

You deserve better.", "Soft ESH.   \n\nHe is the Major A, with you being the minor.  \n\nGood news though.  You now know he will be totally unsupportive in any household chore.  You also know he has no sense of team spirit in backing you when you are in a bind. Finally, you know he is a selfish prick.  \nI say good news because you learned all of this without getting married.  So you are now free to leave without the burden of a messy divorce.  \n\nThis is all behavior that he will repeat. Stay only with the expectation of being treated like this again.   \n\nRemember this as a good experience in that he showed his true colors and demonstrated what a relationship with him really looks like.

But ordering the food was fine.", "Okay first- NTA - not even a little bit. \n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t throw those pies in his face and storm out. \n\nThink about if this is the life you want. He doesn\u2019t help, he\u2019s demanding, he\u2019s super picky, he\u2019s selfish, he\u2019s inflexible, he\u2019s got work to do on his priorities, he\u2019s unappreciative, and he\u2019s an immature little man. \n\nKeep on walking! He\u2019s not worth your time.", "NTA.  Honestly, he deserved worse, but what would have been a kinder decision for yourself, instead of doing something petty but understandable in response to being treated like absolute shit, is to start packing.  This man does not respect you.  It doesn't even sound like he *likes* you.  He values what you do for him, and treats you like an employee (if he treated his employees like shit), not a partner.\n\nDon't buy yourself dinner on his card.  *Leave his ass.*  Find a partner you don't have to be petty with.

Red flags galore!!! \n\nDefinitely NTA!!", "Let me mirror this back for you:\n\nMy boyfriend decided I was going to make six home-made apple pies for thanksgiving with HIS family (I think most people would agree one pie makes an acceptable hosting gift, maybe two of it\u2019s a larger family gathering\u2026.was he planning to send every branch of the family home with their own pie??)\n\nI got up at 4:30AM to accomplish this because he didn\u2019t give me any advanced notice, then had to run to the store for extra ingredients cause he could not be bothered to help, at all, with the six pies HE decided I HAD to make, even after two were burned.\n\nHE found two of the pies to be unacceptable for presentation to HIS family, left without me and said I could follow along after completing two more pies to HIS satisfaction.\n\nTell me, OP, who\u2019s TA in this story?\n\nPlease tell me you did not let him leave the house with the four good pies?\n\nAaaand, for the bot\n\nNTA.
