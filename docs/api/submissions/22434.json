I frantically started trying to unlock the bathroom door, both of my parents joining me within seconds. (For context we have one of those locks on the bathroom that can be easily picked with a spoon or a penny.) When we got the bathroom door unlocked my dad immediately rushed inside to start helping my brother, closing the door behind him. My mom, confused as to why he had closed the door made a reach for the door handle before I stopped her. I tried to subtly hint to her why my little brother wouldn't want her in the bathroom, however she didn't understand so I just outright told her that no 13 year old boy would want his parents to see him naked, but especially not his mom, so it would always be best to let my dad handle this until he was covered. I also told her that if it was his twin sister my mom would probably not want me or my dad in there with her if she was naked, and my mom and older sister would handle it. My mom said it was different since my little sister has 'other parts' while gesturing to her boobs. I honestly didn't know what to respond to that, however I didn't have time to since at that point my dad came out of the bathroom with my little brother. Later I asked my brother about it and he said he was glad I had stopped her, however my older sister said I should have just let her in as she was just worried about him.

Most of the time people who are having epileptic seizures just need someone to sit with them until it stops, the mom probably would have just been in the way in a situation like this.

His brother himself said he's glad his mom wasn't there. There's nothing the mom would do that his dad couldn't already. Emotional people are useless during medical emergencies. A person's privacy is second to their health, and since his health was being taken care of, their privacy should be next.", "How?", "I had that same thought.  Oh wait, so mom is saying because boys don\u2019t have boobies, they\u2019re less entitled to privacy?  Or is mom saying dad can\u2019t be trusted to help sister since she has, you know, boobies?  \n\nFrankly, one more person in the bathroom wasn\u2019t going to make any difference.  Dad obviously knew what to do during a seizure.  He also thought his son would appreciate his mother not seeing him in all his naked glory.  If more help had been needed, dad would have called for it.  \n\nOP is NTA for defaulting to preserving what dignity could be preserved in this situation.  Dealing with epilepsy is probably difficult enough without the embarrassment of your parent of the opposite gender seeing you naked.", "Yep, I'm epileptic, it's kind of embarrassing after you come around, naked or not.\n\nI'm not a very prudish person at all regarding nudity, but it's a uniquely vulnerable position, you don't know what happened and don't remember, but you know that you weren't in control in any way of your own body.\n\nOne trusted person is enough. I had a seizure at work and woke up to like 20 people around me. Someone had a wheelchair which was funny and sweet, but made me more aware of how long I'd been out for.\n\nI just try not to dwell on what they saw, and I was 20 something at the time, not 13. As long as he's safe and has someone adequately caring for him the more private it is the better.", "I don\u2019t think people in general understand what epilepsy is.  In most instances, once it\u2019s determined there\u2019s no injury from a fall, it\u2019s more a monitoring situation than what most people think of as a medical emergency.  Are there times when it\u2019s more?  Yes, but dad would quickly determine that and have called for more help.", "The dad had no way of knowing when he closed the door exactly what had happened. The mum and op where then discussing a hypothetical situation outside the bathmroom", "The kid has epilepsy, if there's a thud from a room he's in its pretty safe to assume he's having a seizure", "YATH \n\nI'm gonna talk in the perpective that I have epilepsy myself since 12 y/o. (I'm currently 22)\n\nYou took your little brother feelings in account but not your mother's. I understand that maybe your brother will be embarassed and a bit upset about it later but the worries of the mother are usually heavier. \n\nIt depends as well to how many seazures has he had before (since she would knew the dad knows what to do) but when you fall down in a bathroom you can hit your head with something, i'm sure she just wanted to check. (And if that was the case i'm sure not only your mather would see hem but the paramedics too)\n\nI'm litteraly not alowed to shower beeing alone at home just in case that could happen (my epilepsy has not an specific reason and can appear at anytime, but its reguled and it souldn't)\n\nAnd you can always put a towel on your brother private parts so that she can see he is ok.", "Your mother give birth to him...its her son, it doesnt matter how old he is. If, good forbides, he shit himself and cant control is esfinger  because of an accident, who do you think is the best person to clean him?  YTA", "As mum of 16 and 14 yo boys, NTA. I'd be desperate to help and probably annoyed at being stopped in the moment, but also really understand afterwards why you did it. Personally, I think it was a really mature choice in a really stressful moment, respecting the relationship between your brother and mum. You sound like an amazing kid!", "Yes...when i was 16 years old my father assisted me. Is my father...iam 41 years old and if i pass out naked in the shower in my parents house,  my father can assist me no problem.its my father, he changed my diapers, he saw me grow up, he doesnt see me has a woman, but only has he daughter. You have to be sick on your mind to see other thing while rescuing a person...specially if they are your son/ daughter.", "Just for the record, men/boys *also* have those \u201cother parts\u201d, they\u2019re just not as sexualised by society as they are with women/girls. \n\nNTA - your dad had it handled, and I would assume had he not, he would have indicated that. Thank you for respecting your brother.", "I have to say I don\u2019t find mom to be completely AHfree, I mean what was that comment about \n\n> it was different since my little sister has other parts \n\nDoes that mean little brother is entitled to less privacy because he \u201eonly has one area to cover\u201c while sister hast two?? That\u2019s just backwards. I get mom being stressed in this situation and everything but I think that the whole family should revisit the sexist comments mom made (and apparently also taught older sister, although that\u2019s debatable)", "No, the mom and sister are assholes in the situation. Mom\u2019s response about \u201cother parts\u201d was sexist, as is thinking the dad isn\u2019t qualified to handle his child\u2019s emergency. The child was being helped. OP is NTA for protecting his privacy, especially since the brother thanked him.", "The father (or OP) could have entered, closed the door, put a towel or something on the boy and open again.\n\nShe was just worried as a mom, and if others could not think of a way to cover him its not her fault and she should be able to check.", ">she\u2019s only thinking about getting to her child\u2014not the child\u2019s nudity.\n\nAs the mom said, if it was her daughter 'she has other parts worth covering' which is really dismissive of the son's privacy.", "And sometimes mums need boundaries. I say that as mum of 2 teenage boys. Dad had it sorted and could have called her in if needed. Would I desperately want to lay eyes on and know he was okay? Yes. Would it be in my son's best interests? No.", "Nah, that's just the mom with her sexist attitude.", "So you agree, the dad should be able to assist his naked daughter of the roles where reversed? (Even though she wanted privacy)", "Yeah, it was an extremely sexist thing for her to say, and to be so dismissive of her son's right to privacy, even though her daughters privacy concerns are high.", "Nope. Dad had it handled, she should wait if she cares about her child more than herself.", "When you have a medical situation, most people would like as few people as possible to see them be vulnerable. Add in being naked, and being a young teenager... Crowding round him (and presumably the bathroom isn't an enormous space either) would make him feel worse once the seizure is over. And from what I understand sometimes this can actually worsen seizures, the claustrophobia of being crowded. \n\nI understand that the mam didn't even think about the nudity because she's an adult and concerned about her child, not bothered about the nudity, but when the other kid pointed this out she clearly understood that this would be embarrassing from a young girl's perspective but didn't think the same applied to her son?!", "I find Moms can often feel like they are the exception.", "Of course they do. Medical privacy is a thing and you can absolutely, even as a minor, refuse your parent to come into medical appointments or be informed of your conditions. This is to keep children safe from potential abusers, or just overbearing parents who will try to control them. People feel uncomfortable with their parents knowing about things such as mental health conditions and birth control prescriptions ALL THE TIME and their privacy is legally protected for good reason."]}
