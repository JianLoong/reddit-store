My husband got him a year before we met so I never got to bond with him in his kitty years. I love him to death now and I wouldn\u2019t give him up for anything. The only reason why I want my own cat is that I have never had an affectionate pet and I want to experience being cuddled, licked, absolutely smothered by a cat and I want to do the same to the kitty cat. Unfortunately for me, our current cat is the opposite. He doesn\u2019t like being picked up, forget about cuddling or even just laying. He is absolute joy don\u2019t get me wrong but he is just not affectionate. Now to make it clear, he isn\u2019t my responsibility. My husband cares for him 100%, from cleaning his litter to brushing his teeth to feeding him. I do, of course, help out when I can to feed him, clean his litter box, brush him, and clip his nails but this is about 10% of the time. \n\nThe issue is that my husband doesn\u2019t trust me to care for a cat. He says he works from home so the added responsibility will be his and he would end up doing everything for my cat as well. Which to I said that I would not let that happen. I would try my best to care for the cat as he does for his. I work nights and my schedule isn\u2019t the best, I sleep for long hours. I offered to take off work for couple weeks to help our cats get used to each other and me learning how to care for my cat. But he said what about after? To which I said I would hope I would have a routine for my cat fit my schedule so it wouldn\u2019t fall on him. He just doesn\u2019t believe me. He brought up the time I had goldfish and how they died. Which was really sad for me and I honestly felt horrible - I had tried my best, they lived for a year and a half. He had helped me with their filter changes and I kept up with it but they still died. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAnyway, I have wanted a cat for as long as I can remember and it\u2019s sad to say, those goldfish were a substitute for wanting a cat. \n\nMy husband can be mean about this and has said ultimately it\u2019s his house and he gets to decide which ends up shutting this argument down. I can\u2019t argue with that. \n\nAITA for insisting on this?\n\nEdit: alright guys I get it I m the asshole. I\u2019ll drop it. My husband knows me better and if all you strangers can say I m the asshole for wanting a cat, I am sure I could\u2019ve have just asked him \ud83d\ude02\n\nThank you for taking your time for responding \ud83d\ude42 humbled me", "created_utc": 1672069461, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvps46/aita_for_insisting_on_getting_a_cat/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you acknowledge you don't have a good schedule why bring a dependant creature into it?

Other than that he prefers to be outside.\n\n- One loved to be cuddled and petted as a kitten. As an adult cat he hates it. If you pick him up for more than a few seconds he will bite your nose.\n\nIt's almost impossible to know how they will act when they settle in - and whether they will get along with the cat who is already there (even if you manage the introduction as well as you can).\n\nIf you are determined to get a cat why not show that you can commit to equally caring for the cat you already have.  Then your husband might be more keen on the idea..", "YTA not for wanting a cat, but for wanting a living toy.\n\nEven if you get a kitten, the adult cat's personality may not be exactly what it is as a kitten.

BUT you also need to be realistic and understanding that this is a LIVING. THINKING BEING, not a breathing teddy bear!", "YTA. You're wanting a cat for all the wrong reasons wrong reasons. You want the cute kitten stage, then what? I have an older kitten (8 months) and they take a lot of work and looking after still. Plus the kitten isn't forced to be cuddly.

That is a crap-shoot no matter how much you think you will bond with a kitty.  Cats are not like dogs in that way.  I've had multiple and it is more nature than nurture whether they will be a cat that is affectionate.\n\n(b) that you would have a cat with a routine that would fit your schedule, as you say.  That one, unfortunately, made me laugh aloud.  Good luck with that.  Cats fit nothing about their lives to their owner's schedule.  Your cat will pick the most inconvenient time to eat . . . such as when you are sleeping . . . when you are at work.  It will get annoyed if it's litter box is not to its liking and express that no doubt when your husband is at home and you and are at work.\n\nYour husband seems adamant that you NOT have a pet, and he has thrown out the power move of it's his house.  There are only two reasons for this:  (1) He is a total, controlling dick that dictates everything you can and cannot do, (2) and/OR you have a history of taking on responsibilities that you end up relinquishing or forcing him to do on your behalf.\n\nHave you been truthful with the latter?  Is the goldfish the only time that he has had to help you with something that initially was supposed to be your responsibility alone?\n\nThink about this question because the answer is very important for more reasons that just getting a cat.\n\nIf your husband is generally a good guy and never says the \"it's my house . . . my decision\" stuff except for this one time, and it's because of the latter reason, then you probably need to prove that you can take on the responsibility of caring for a pet by following through with other smaller things.\n\nIf, however, your husband dictates a whole host of things and pulls out the \"it's my house\" excuse any time he gets push back from you . . . you have much bigger problems, and ones you should address immediately before you even think about bringing other lives, pets included, into this marriage.", "NTA.

Also, cats may not like each other and there\u2019s no way to guarantee any will want cuddles with you. Wanting a cat because the other doesn\u2019t cuddle you is not a good reason to get a second cat.\n\nWe got a second cat because we wanted our first to have company when we weren\u2019t around, before they got too old.

I have also had animals who were initially affectionate but after living with me for a period, became less so. It is not for lack of love. \n\nMy vet explained that an animal may be affectionate to start with as they know that will keep them safe.

Be patient, if she doesn't want to play, just sit there with the toys. Sit near her without touching. Talk to her. Get her a nice blanket or hide and sleep with it a couple of nights before giving it to her. Don't be offended if she doesn't touch it at first. \n\nBasically you need to teach her that you're not going to smother her, that you respect her comfort zone. She may never be cuddly but some of the most affectionate animals I've ever cared for have been no-touchy.
