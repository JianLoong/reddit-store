Well we sang happy birthday blew out my candles and started cutting cake and distributing it.\n\nWhile I was sitting down talking with my friends my cousin came behind me with frosting from his cake and I kid you not PALMED HALF OF MY FACE IN CAKE FROSTING. Like there was a visible hand print on my face and I was shocked. \n\nI naturally was very mad and was like \"yo wtf!?\" And he was laughing because he didn't think it was a big deal we started arguing back and forth and my mom came in after hearing me screaming and asked what's wrong and audibly gasped after seeing half my face covered in cake frosting. I will admit I called him some very colorful words and stormed out to my room to try and remove the icing while saving some of my makeup.\n\nThankfully one of my friends was a lot more skilled in makeup then me was able to help out with the small amount of makeup I had in my room but when I came back down I was still livid. When I came back down my friends and family were getting ready to start some games and I stopped it pulled my cousin to the side and told him he needed to grab his things and go  now he was confused and asked if I was actually that upset about the frosting and I said yes and told him he's no longer welcomed and needs to go home.\n\nFrustrated he told my mom about it and she said that it was my party so there isn't really anything she can do about my guest list. Since then I got a lot of text from other friends who both do and don't have my side and feel like I overreacted. Mind you my cousin isn't some little kid he's 16 he knows better.

I never understand how people think this is okay. Like, if you tried that with a stranger at a food court, you could expect to have the police called on you. At best. But it okay to do to family on their freaking birthday?", "NTA.  \n\nYou made it clear you didn\u2019t want cake on your face, and they ignored it.  \n\nI get you\u2019re all teenagers, and they\u2019re younger at 16.  So there\u2019s definitely a maturity element at play on their part.   I\u2019m curious though, who did they think would laugh at this?  Did they have their own friends there that they were trying to impress?  Or did they legit think you would laugh at this?  \n\nIf they were trying to look cool at your expense, then you did the right thing absolutely.  \n\nIf they thought you\u2019d find it funny and it was a mistimed joke, then you still did the right thing, but I\u2019d encourage you to follow up.  Let them know that you didn\u2019t want this to be that sort of party\u2026 you were going for something a little more sophisticated.   Hell, you had makeup and a nice dress on.  It took effort to get that look together, and it took confidence to wear it out.   And when you do all that, and suddenly get turned into a laughing stock, it hurts a really deep level.   \n\nI\u2019m hoping this situation is more the latter, where they meant well, but they\u2019re a little too young to understand the situation.  It could be a great opportunity for growth honestly.   \n\nHappy Birthday though!", "NTA Smashing cake in someone's face is rude. It isn't funny. It isn't charming. It's just plain rude.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes", "NTA. He exhibited zero respect for you, he should not have been surprised when you kicked him out.\n\nActions have consequences both good and bad. His bad actions gave him undesirable consequences.", "You made a clear boundary.\n\nYour cousin broke it.\n\nBreaking boundaries have consequences.\n\nYour cousin just learned about consequences.\n\nWhen he's ready to take full accountability and sincerely apologise to you for breaking your boundary then you can consider forgiving him. Until then, stick to your guns and don't get involved with any of the fallout.\n\nYou're helping to learn a valuable life lesson.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Is this a cultural thing?  I have never seen anyone do that before, except a baby on their first birthday, but they get it on themselves.  AND it's enough of a thing at your home, you had to say don't do that before the cake was served.  \n\nSo really, why do that?", "A classic \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes\" situation. Your cousin's a jerk and would have been a jerk even if there wasn't makeup involved. You don't put your hands (with or without frosting) on people who've told you not to.
