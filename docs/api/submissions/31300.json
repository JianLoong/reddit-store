The only difference is I had my first child 10 years ago while she had her first sixteen years ago (in her twenties for those who don't wanna do the math).\n\nI was and still am a career woman. I love my field and my work and I really work with passion. My work field is also where I met my husband. I deliberately waited some more to meet the right person and have kids because above all I wanted financial and career stability. I needed to know that I'm at a point where if I leave for a long period of time, I can pick up where I left when I come back.\n\nWe had children in our thirties and even if we're not young parents, we love it. We have enough money to give them the top notch things without struggling or having to give up other stuff, we can work our schedules around them and basically focus all our attention on them because we've already achieved most of the milestones career-wise (and in other fields). Because of these, my kids ended up having really great results in most of the things they tried including school.\n\nOne day, while I was telling my friends about the latest events regarding my kids (not bragging, just telling like any parent who's happy for their kid) my Friend said someone like \"when my son was ten he didn't have his parents always backing him up\". I asked her what stopped her and she said because of work. She told me I wouldn't know since I have a job easier to raise a kid with and what she went trough is a \"young parent struggle\" that I couldn't understand. I told her my job is easy now because I worked hard before, and I deliberately wanted to have kids later so I can offer them the undivided attention.\n\nThere were lots of side eyes and nods around the group and the conversation died there. Later Friend accused me of humiliating her in public and called me an AH, saying I don't get to judge her decisions. I don't think I judged them, I just defended myself when she tried to downlook on me as an older parent.

And you said you \"worked harder before so it would be easier\" which kind of insinuates that she didn't work as hard. Which may not have been your intended meaning, but can be easily misconstrued. She sounded jealous and you sounded a little \"better than thou\". \n\nBoth of you could've have expressed your feelings better. She could have said \"I wish I was able to be with my kid more but work got in the way\"\n\nAnd you could've said something along the lines of \" your kids are great despite you feeling like you weren't able to have their back as much\" \n\nSorry but I feel you're both the AH for downplaying eachothers struggles.", "ESH for this mommy wars crap but mostly you because you sound insufferable.", "ESH. She wasn\u2019t looking down on you, you didn\u2019t have to \u201cdefend\u201d yourself. But you also didn\u2019t judge her. You both felt as though the other attacked, when neither did. By both getting defensive when you shouldn\u2019t have, you both created a weird vibe and an uncomfortable situation.", "There really isn't that big of a gap when you first had children so I don't get why you think the parenting difference is due to that. It's not as if she gave birth when she was a teenager.\n\nYour kids are doing well now, that might not always be the case. If you left  work for a long period of time, you might not be able to return just like that.\n\nParenting is hard no matter what age you decide to start having children. You both sound assholey.", "you sound like an asshole", "ESH\n\nProbably more YTA. But it's not a competition, it's an obnoxious argument.\n\n>(not bragging, just telling like any parent who's happy for their kid)\n>I just defended myself\n\nBased on this post, you seem to \"not brag\" and \"defend\" yourself a lot.", "YTA\nAnd I had my kid in my late 30s and early 40\u2026 so there on your canon of view I am even better! \nGot so much money saved I didn\u2019t even went back to work after my last one was born and now I m 100% there for them retired. Reality is. Parental choices are personal. There is NOT the perfect solution. Having kids later may be financially beneficial, but no joke for will be physically more tired. Kids will benefit to have you there for them all the time? But may not learn resiliency, independency? You may not be there personally but have a great support network system. \nSo yes you can not understand what she went through. Like she can not understand YOUR situation. Her was a statement \u2018you don\u2019t understand\u2019 your was \u2018my choice is better then yours\u2019\nIt isn\u2019t. It is just another valid choice.", "NTA - You made a conscious decision to wait and have children when you felt ready and able to give them the best possible life. It's not fair for your friend to judge you for that. Parenting is hard at any age, and both young and older parents face their own unique challenges. You have every right to defend your choices and be proud of the life you've built for your kids.", "YTA. You sound insufferable.", "YTA. You are making it sound as if it is solely your choices that have made it possible to have \"the good life\" now. Well, it isn't! Loads of people work hard all their lives without ever reaching that point. Loads of people don't choose to be young parents, yet they don't have the funds to furnish their kids with luxury items. You come across as somewhat privilege blind.", "YTA. You could have shown your friend some empathy but instead you judged her from on top of your high horse. Oh and you are taking credit for your kids getting \u201creally great results in most of the things they tried\u201d, rather than recognizing that there are many factors that go into how well kids do and each child has their own strengths and challenges.\n\nImagine for a moment what you sound like to someone whose child is struggling with a learning disability. Or whose child is struggling with their mental health. Or whose spouse died and they\u2019re doing their best as a single parent. Or who was SA when young and decided to keep and raise the baby.", "NTA - Didn't she judge you first? And then you only responded with facts?

So you made accordingly. She didn't.", "NTA - You made a conscious decision to have children later in life, ensuring that you could provide them with the best possible upbringing. It's not fair for your friend to belittle your choices and imply that you had it easier. Parenting is a challenge regardless of age, and what matters most is the love and support we give to our children. Keep doing what you're doing and ignore the unnecessary judgment.", "If more people actually waited until they were stable in their home, relationship, and career before having children like you did I really believe we would see less broken homes, children medicated and in therapy by age 8, and certainly less children in foster care.

People who don\u2019t do it will always judge you. It\u2019s strange to me how people still perceive you as having it easier now and you should empathize with your friend\u2019s struggles. You made a choice to have it HARD first, so it\u2019s easier later. Do what you do and don\u2019t care about them, but maybe don\u2019t brag about your kids anymore, people are always jealous.", "NTA. You did it the right way\u2026 and weren\u2019t even saying she did it wrong. She\u2019s jealous.\n\nBoth parenting ages have their merits, though. She\u2019ll be done before you and get to relax earlier, so at least she\u2019s got that. But of course a parent never truly stops working, so.. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnyway, very happy for you and your family! Definitely goals.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
