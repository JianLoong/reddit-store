I'm the eldest of five.   \n\nMy youngest sibling is 18 years younger than me.  I grew up watching my mother's health decline with every pregnancy to the point where she was on insulin for her entire pregnancy and bedrest the final trimester and then  induced a month early.  She was 41.  \n\nI flat out told my now husband that if we were going to have kids, it'd be early and that the baby making factory was closed at 30.  I was 21 when I had my son.   It was rough juggling demanding work schedules in this modern hellscape with limited resources and zero family support.  We had some really tight years and there were opportunities that our son missed out on or only had one parent there for.   \n\nI'm smart and worked hard myself through my twenties and thirties to have the life I have as a successful career woman with a 20+ yr stable marriage and a child that my husband and I are extremely proud of.    Am I was far along as some? No.  But am I happy with my career this far? Yes.  \n\nSo, yea, I can see how your friend had her back up as soon as you first demanded/asked \"what stopped you?\"and then your later reply of how you were \"smart and worked hard before having kids\".  \n\nOne, you failed to even attempt to see her perspective before arguing (through implication if nothing else) that your method was better.   \n\nTwo, it's not on you to decide if you were judgemental.  Just as with harassment at work, the harasser isn't the one who determines if they harassed someone or not, the victim is.   \n\nYour friend felt attacked and judged by the way your responded to her observation that she hadn't been able to give her son the same support at when he was your son's age.   \n\n\"What stopped you?\" Is an AT BEST, blunt question that I would not have expected from a \"friend\".  At worst, an insinuation that she failed in some way.  \n\nImpact has more weight than intent.   As an educated successful career woman, YOU KNOW THIS.   You may not have intended your question to be bluntly judgemental, but it had that effect.  \n\nAnd then you made it worse.  YTA.   Do you even LIKE this friend?

If you want to tell OP to phrase things more positively in a response to that then you are clearly calling for placating behavior towards someone pushing a narrative here.", "When someone is sharing an achievement, saying \"you wouldn't be able to do that without XYZ\" is a dig  because it's trying to minimise the achievement and make it about how poor you had to work harder and raise kids. Well, \"friend\" if you're gonna be like that, I might just point out you didnt HAVE to do it that way you just planned poorly.", "OP is the one who said there was a connection between the resources she has and her children\u2019s achievements. All her friend did was repeat the narrative that OP put out there. If she didn\u2019t want people saying her kids achieve things because of what she invested in them, she shouldn\u2019t have said it first."]}
