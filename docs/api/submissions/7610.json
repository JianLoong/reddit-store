{"id": 7610, "submission_id": "10ew7q0", "title": "AITA for not wanting to support changes to my bf's custody agreement?", "selftext": "I (32f) have been living with my boyfriend Will (31m) for 2 years. We met 3 years ago, and moved in relatively soon because of Covid.\n\nWill has a son, Max (almost 7), from a previous relationship. Max is sweet lively kid, that is with us two weekends  month, and then a few weeks during school holidays. Will relationship with his ex is mostly amicable, so sometimes they can agree on an extra day/evening (for example if we want to take max to a specific event).\n\nThe custody agreement is what it is because Will used to work in a creative field, have irregular hours, and could have a full co-parenting agreement. during Covid, Will changed fields and now has more regular hours.\n\nRecently he brought up he wants to go to court and and get a co-parenting agreement (I.e. he would have Max one week, his mother the next, and so on). So 50% of my time.  \n\n\nHere's the issue.\n\nI am disabled and can only work part time. Also my work needs some preparation from home. And I need significant time to rest/decompress. This would not be possible there with a child there every other week.  \n\n\nWill has also voiced his expectation that I would sometimes bring him and pick him up from school, and take care of him before he gets back from work.\n\nNow, I like Max, but this is too much - If I do all that I'd barely still be able to work at all. And I could rest all week.\n\nI told Will that this is not something I want, I think the custody agreement is good as it is, and that changing it would too much care on me.\n\nWill was obviously not happy. I then told him that if he truly wants this, I could move back with my mother, and we could just go to a non-cohabiting relationship.\n\nWill was ALSO not happy with this, because apparently my presence gives him more chance to get a custody change (he says) and also he feels like it would ruin our relationship. (I don't necessarily agree on the latter, especially as we mostly moved in for pragmatic reasons, and I'd be equally happy just having a relationship without cohabiting).\n\nI just don't want to participate in a custody agreement that will put a lot of strain on me and might even impact my ability to work.

Including child care and transportation to/from school, the same as any other single parent has to do.\n\nHowever, you should also take the time to consider what you want out of this relationship.  Will has a kid.  That is going to mean extra demands of your time.  If you aren\u2019t willing to do that, it\u2019s better to start setting up your boundaries now.

The fact that your partner is ONLY okay with you agreeing to take on a significantly larger portion of childcare gives you all the information that you need in this situation. There really is no reason why having you as a partner would impact his likelihood of changing the custody agreement. \n\nIf he is unable to care for his own child 50% of the time and *needs* you there to help him, that is a major issue, and he should not be pursuing 50/50 custody if he's not ready to provide the care his son needs.", "ESH. As a father, he should be as active as possible in his child\u2019s life, which includes getting more custody time if he is able to. Two weekends a month and a couple of weeks during school holidays isn\u2019t that much time. You can\u2019t date someone with a child (and live with them) and then be annoyed that the child might actually regularly be a part of your household because it\u2019s inconvenient to you. You probably should\u2019ve thought about this earlier. What if his son suddenly needed to move in with you all if something happened to his mom? \n\nHowever, your bf sucks more because he should not be planning to offload childcare responsibilities onto you without your consent and (in my opinion) he shouldn\u2019t be seeking more custody time if he is unable to care for his child without someone else doing most of the work. It defeats the whole purpose of trying to get more custody time. You have every right to move out if you don\u2019t want commit to this task, however, I don\u2019t really see the relationship surviving much further, as it seems like he wants you to eventually be a stepparent and you are unwilling to do that, which there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but you (both of you tbh) really should have thought about it much earlier.", "NAH.

If it was so he could actually see and spend more time with his son, that\u2019s one thing (but it\u2019s still perfectly acceptable for you to say no), but it seems more likely given his attitude that he\u2019s using you so that his support payments go down (more time spent at dad\u2019s = less support to pay to mom) and expecting you to basically drop your life to accommodate that, which is incredibly selfish, and would make me seriously rethink the relationship.", "NTA.  There is no obligation to make Max a larger part of your life.  Will's wish for expanded custody arrangements will benefit him only.

Here's the ugly truth to disabilities, we don't choose them. They hurt us and our relationships enough as it is, we can't take afford to take on more than we agreed to originally. BF is well aware of OPs disability and doesn't care, thinking that OP can get over that disability to co-raise a son which OP didn't sign up for. BF also only has an interest in changing the custody of his son, if OP remains available through cohabitation to watch and help raise him.\n\nOP has very clear boundaries and limitations when it comes to disability and not being able to raise a kid. If raising children comes before romantic partners, BF can just as easily state that OP is free to go back to their mom. That's not what BF wants though. BF wants OP around as a free nanny or co-parent, and isn't willing to work on the relationship if OP has to move away in order for their disability to be properly accommodated. BF doesn't care about causing more harm to OP (via lack of disability accommodations) and also doesn't want his son around for a full week if he has to care for him alone.\n\nOP isn't an A/H for knowing what they can and cannot do. OP isn't an A/H for offering a compromise that ensures they can still look after their health and well-being as well as maintain a relationship with BF. I can guarantee, as someone with a disability who never received accommodations for it as a kid, that not looking after your own health harms the child far more and can even lead to trauma and behavioral issues. My dad never looked after his own health even as he ripped a hole through his hand, got cancer, broke his foot, etc. as a result, he ignored my disability and claimed I was faking it. I'm 22 and only now am I getting diagnosed and having people question why I was never tested for symptoms that have been in my medical file for years now. (Chronic pain, fatigue, fainting, dizzy spells, musculoskeletal complications, and more). That's just one example of how not looking after your own health can negatively impact a child. Another is how a family friend ended up with a severely malnourished son whose intestines could be seen because he started emulating her eating habits and she had a woefully unhealthy relationship with food. (She's working on healing her relationship with food to help him, he's slowly putting on weight again. He's 10 now, but 8 when the doctors first told her she was going to kill him if she didn't work on her relationship with food). \n\nOP trying to raise his son with him will *certainly* cause more complications to arise for their health and will negatively impact the child's life as well. Being exposed to someone's disability for a few days is nothing like living alongside them and seeing their disability 24/7. The son wasn't born into a situation where they could see disabilities and normalize that for OPs sake, and OP doesn't have the support system and accommodations in place that would allow them to co-parent effectively, and it doesn't sound like the BF is willing to help with that.\n\nOP is NTA.", "YTA. I'll never understand why people will date a person with kids but then doesn't want to have a parent type role for said kid.

The fact people are trying to say Op is the AH is more concerning because she has been all for her BF getting more custody of his child, but she physically can not watch and care for the child in the capacity the child will need and that the BF is demanding from her.

It's great that he wants to see his son more, but he needs to be able to do the picking up and dropping off and all of that or make arrangements without having to depend on you to care for his son, especially because a lasting relationship isn't guaranteed so it's not wise for a parent to depend on that.

I have 50/50 (set up as a 2-2-5-5 schedule) with both of my kids and they both hate it because it's just a lot of back and forth, but their dads live 20 and 35 minutes away. Neither wanted a week on, week off schedule either because they didn't want to go 7 days without coming to my house. My daughter (17) has really been staying here most of the time. She's supposed to be at her dad's every Monday and Tuesday but usually stays one of those days with me and often on Fridays as well because I live 2 miles from her school.
