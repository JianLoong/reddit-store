We have been friends off and on since junior high. I have been there for her throughout her life as emotional and sometimes financial support. She has left me behind for other friends and refused to stick up for me when I needed it the most. She made a lot of bad choices in her early teens and 20's so she burned a lot of bridges with family and friends. She now only has her mother and myself to rely on if she needs help. This background is relevant to why we are having this issue now.\n\nMy friend is now a single parent and has a daughter 6f who is non verbal autistic and has severe behavioral issues. Her daughter cannot be left unsupervised for her own safety. I have watched her daughter on several occasions and her grandmother has as well. I do have my own life with a husband 36m and son 14m. My friend is disabled and doesn't work. I work a very stressful but fulfilling job around 50 hours or more a week. The past 3-4 months she has had frequent trips to the ER for things that turn out to be non emergency issues that the doctors say can't figure out. I have taken her and watched her daughter at least 4 of those ER visits. I cleaned her house as well as picked up and put away her groceries. I used some of my vacation time to do this. I have turned her down 2 times on watching or picking up her daughter so she could go to the ER because I was at work or had a doctor's appointment. These two times she accepted that answer. \n\nShe messaged me today, said her nurses line told her to go to the ER with what symptoms she is having. She sent me a message saying she would wait til it was my day off so I could watch her daughter. I told her I already had doctor appointments that day as did my husband. I also had made plans months ago with my husband and son to spend time together. I also said she should go asap and not wait til it's my day off. She replied saying her mom can't watch her daughter today so she couldn't go. I told her the ER is for immediate emergencies and if she was able to wait to go then it wasn't an emergency and she needed to go to urgent care while her daughter was in school. She got upset and told me I was heartless and was the only person who could help. I told her that her family needed to step up and help and that it wasn't fair to expect me to do this all the time. I said my time is valuable too and I don't owe her anything and that I've done more than enough. I restated that I couldn't do it and that was final. I'm worried that I may have gone too far.

It sucks that your 'friend' is going through this, but based off what you said it is a mess of her own making.", "NTA.  Your assessment would have been mine....how you gonna wait for my day off to go to the emergency room.  It's clearly not an emergency.  Also why are you cleaning her house?  Is her daughter on disability, why doesn't she get some respite care?", "NTA. You have been very generous with your friend and it sounds like she is not appreciating all you have done for her. I understand that she's stressed out, but it's unreasonable of her to lash out at you for not helping her out.", "NTA, in the slightest. It's a nice gesture if you can help a friend out, but it is in no way your obligation; and as you have pointed out, it's not an emergency. If your friend can delay her visit, however-many days, should be more than enough time to make other arrangements.\n\nHer response does seem to explain all her past burned bridges, though, not unlikely the reason why the mom does not seem to be able to help.", "NTA\nThat you\u2019ve helped her in the past doesn\u2019t include an obligation to do so in the future, especially when it comes at the cost of your own health and time with your own family.", "NTA\n\nHaving a disabled child like that is incredibly difficult so it's no wonder she wants a day to herself occasionally, even if it's just sitting in the ER. But this is not your problem.\n\nI don't know what country/state you are located but in my state parents of disabled children can get respite care. Basically, depending on the type/severity of the disability, the government will pay for someone to take/babysit the child for X hours a month. \n\nOf course, you can't suggest any of that right now as she has blocked you, but we both know that won't last long and she'll be back to asking for favors again soon. \n\nWe had a woman in the neighborhood in a similar situation. Tied to the child almost non-stop, with no future of it getting better, started making her a little crazy (totally understandably). Some of us women in the community started taking her to lunch while the kid was at school. Just adult time, at a modest venue. Talk about regular stuff, not children, not health issues, just normal boring stuff. It helped. \n\nBasically, this woman is in the pattern of living crisis to crisis because there is nothing else. \n\nAbsolutely not your problem. \n\nIf she comes back into your life, be firm about your boundaries.", "NTA be thankful you\u2019re blocked\u2026 \u2026 for now, anyway.

First, you are completely correct that if she doesn\u2019t have to go right now then it\u2019s not actually an emergency and she can go to urgent care. 2.

You\u2019re right in setting boundaries. You have helped her because you\u2019re a good person, not because it is your responsibility. Too bad she doesn\u2019t know how to recognize the two. \n\nUltimately, it is her loss for blocking you since she is the one needing the help. She\u2019s punishing you for not acting how she wants you to. Beggar\u2019s can\u2019t be choosers. She\u2019ll unblock you right back once she needs help again. And if she\u2019s too proud, that\u2019s on her. \n\nIdk what kind of value she adds to you life, but i suggest to just let her be. If she needs the help, she will come looking for you again, and you just have to continue with your boundaries and if you want, you can communicate to her that she can\u2019t boss you around and expect you to drop anything and everything when she asks.", "NTA.  It can't possibly be an emergency if she can wait until your day off, your advice to go to urgent care during school was good.\n\nAre you really worried about being blocked?  It sounds like you're more a friend of convenience to her than a real friend.", "NTA,  of course the nurse line will tell her to go to ER immediately. You watch she'll unblock you when she needs something. If she can wait until your day off she can go when her child is at school.", "NTA. If you can put off going to the ER so you can have childcare, then your issue isn't an emergency. She can go to urgent care as you said or book an appointment for a clinic that has after hours. Not your fault she's burned her bridges.", "NTA- \n\nNot only did you say no, but you also gave her suggestions as what to do instead (go to urgent care while daughter is at school- hell, she could even go to the ER while her daughter is in school!) also\u2026if the nurses suggested she go, then she needs to go as soon as possible. Not when it works with you and your schedule.", "NTA. I\u2019m not going to comment on your friend\u2019s behavior other than to say it\u2019s bizarre. You are not obligated to watch her daughter EVER. She needs to spend more time building a support system.", "NTA, and your \"if it's not an immediate emergency, go to an urgent care when your daughter is in school\" is 100% accurate. If it's an EMERGENCY, she would have to go now (while you're working), and if it's not, she should take your advice.", "NTA. I can't ask a bloodclot in my body to slow down because it's an inconvenience. I'll die. If she can postpone going to the ER, she surely doesn't have something deadly going on.", "NTA. You are not her care giver. You are a friend. You\u2019ve helped her when you could but you are not obligated to keep helping.  You set a reasonable boundary and she needs to respect that.

I waited thinking maybe I pulled a muscle, waited a full 4 days from symptom onset. Was in between primary drs as hadn't found a new one. It kept getting worse, laying down made it worse, started to hurt worse when coughing.  I finally decided to just drive myself to ER, called my husband to let him know and would keep him posted if I needed him.  Arrived at a perfect time, no crowds!  Got taken back straight to EKG and to a room, 10 min later to CT scan.  Dr. comes in  little later.  My left lung was riddled with blood clots.  No history of dvt or clots. They said covid provoked.  I was told I was being admitted for likely several days and put on Heparin drip.  Dr asks why I didnt come in sooner, could have died.  Still on thinners.  2nd round covid this year, mu h tougher then previous one...2 weeks after recovey, bad chest pain. Keep in mind since the clots I stayed with continued chest pain, they say long covid.  Since it got worse, feom a 5 to 8 pain scale, knew something was up.This time called the new primary and said get there asap. Luckily was pleurisy only.   \n\nI have had other iasues issues like gallbladder that landed me at ER as well, finally had surgery for that, which I had to delay as my hemo wouldnt allow me to stop thinners for 3 months for surgery.
