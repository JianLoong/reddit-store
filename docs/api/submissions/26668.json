His father (30yr), has always been a bare minimum father. His child support, involvement, or even asking about him is all at minimum. He has no visitation or rights since we were married, and he told county he didnt want visitation. So, I have to approve all visits. This is his only child. He never calls of work when he is sick, gives excuses why he can't have him on the weekends, etc. However, he has plenty of vacation and PTO to go on vacations 3-4 times a year, but he won't provide anything for his son. If his mother didn't ask for my son, he wouldn't see him. Yes, he still lives with his mom. \nA week ago my son got sick, I tried to care for him, but he needed intense care and fluids. I told his father he was in the hospital, and wouldn't wake up. After hours of intense treatment, his father finally showed up to the hospital, stayed for about 2-3 hours and left. He told me he would be back the next morning, he never showed. The day after he came for another 2 hours, and left. Work was more important, and he didn't want to call off. He made a joke that one day off would shorten my child support payment, I told him I didn't care about child support, I needed a break and his son needed him. Two more days go by, everyone knows how my son is doing but his father. Finally, Sunday came. My ex's first off day since our son was admitted. Surely he would be there! Nope! He went to a bar with his gf to watch football and drink the entire day away. My son had to stay another day, he still wasn't improving too well. I called his father, I needed a break, clean clothes, and fresh air. Slurring his words, he tells me that he would be there eventually but no time soon. I told him to not come, especially drunk.  Hours later, 10 at night he comes in with his gf, I've talked to, she's been around my kids, but never met me officially. I was pissed and lost it. I told him to make his gf leave. She said she wasn't going anywhere. I told her she had no relevancy to my son, and had no place in the hospital. My ex stated over and over \"that's my gf\". They've only been together 1 year, and trust me, settling down is not his game. I told them both, that my son have been in the hospital for 5 days, his father has only been there for 4 1/2 hours. So mathematically, that's an F. And now isn't the time to pretend to be daddy to make yourself look good to your gf. Needless to say, she refused to leave. So after a few colorful words, I had her removed, she got agressive. I made him leave too. Sending him off with \"being a father isn't a publicity stunt to get laid, be better to be excused\".

I also wouldn't offer any information to him or his mother unless they actually reach out and ask about your son. It's really none of their business and it seems that when they choose (oh what a luxury to be able to \"choose\"!!!) to involve themselves in your son's life however minimal, it adds more stress and time and effort to your life. It never relieves you of anything or even shares any of the weight with you. \n\nJust don't bother! And reply short and sweet and matter of fact when/if they do reach out -- look up \"greyrocking\".", "NTA. It's not good for your son to have a \"father\" show up against his own will, when drunk, or when he has nothing better to do. I would stop facilitating any visits. Just stick to whatever the court order says (if there is one). And definitely report him if he doesn't pay child support. That money is for your son and you should not be saying that you don't care about it.", "NTA. He\u2019s a deadbeat", "NTA\nYour son is seeing all this. He's seeing your distress trying to get his father to see him. You should stop trying to force this deadbeat to actively parent. A disinterested reluctant visit won't do your child any good.", "A little bit the AH. Not because you kicked them out, but simpluy because after all the complaints about your ex, your focus was on kicking the gf out. Not him. Her. If you had decided to kick him out earlier or kick them both out at the same time, then you wouldn\u2019t be an AH at all.", "NTA they sound awful. I hope your son is doing better!", "NTA\u2026 sorry to say as I\u2019m going through the same thing we have to face the fact that we are a single mom. The dad is not mature enough to handle responsibilities and honestly after seeing how he acted with your son in hospital would you trust him around them.\n\nI understand you need a break, trust I totally get that! See if you can work a schedule with your former MIl that she watches your son and also your mom even if it\u2019s a few hrs to relax and fuel up again. \n\nYour better off not calling him or letting him know as being a \u201cparent is not stunt to get laid or get points\u201d.", "NTA. But he's not a Dad or a Father, he's a sperm donor. He went so far as to say he doesn't want any visitation. I would make zero efforts to facilitate a relationship between him and your son. He will hurt your son time and time again. It's better to just cut him out while your son is still young.", "Gentle Esh, he doesn\u2019t want to be a father so your exposing your child to this arsehole. \nTell his mom she can see him through you, he\u2019s not to see him though. If she\u2019s a decent woman then she\u2019ll agree. \nHope your son is doing better now, I imagine you are exhausted, is there no-one else, your parents, siblings or even a friend who can help you out? \ud83d\udc90", "Slight YTA, he made it clear other than minimum child support he does not want anything to do with the child. Do not rely on him and act shocked when he lets you down. He basically has told you multiple times he does not care, why do you still reach out to him?", "YTA. Why would he hang around the hospital if it meant interacting with you? You clearly don't like him. He clearly doesn't like you. I am willing to be my life savings that you are rude to each other every time you speak. Hating your ex-husband is fine.

I care for him long after it runs out, and nothing extra is given. He needed his parents there, that's important.", "When they first walked in, I made it clear they needed to go. He said he at least wanted to hug his son. I said that's fine but she needed to go. She thought she had the right to stay, and he agreed. So I told them both to leave. I gave him a chance to put his son first, but like his fashion, he failed.", "Slowly he is, Thank you!!", "So, his mom doesn't drive. She also defended him. Blaming his father for not being there. So it excuses him from being there. My mother, has been caring for my 6 yr old, and my father is a double amputee, so she can't relieve me either. Such a blessing, after 5 days we get to go home to see if he continues to get better.", "His mother blames the fact that his father wasn't there, so it excuses him for not being here. And no, I have no one else. My mother is caring for my 6 yr old. So he was my only chance of relief.", "He made it clear he will see him when he sees him, but he still wants to be updated with what's going on. I know if I didn't give him the chance to be here, I would be the monster. So I provided all opportunities for him to not be selfish for once and do right by his son.", "You would lose your life savings. I am over him/ his choices. We choose peace, so my son can know his father. Since my son's been born, we agreed, no arguments will be had in front of him. We are very amicable around my boys. They never see us fight, argue, or say anything negative. That's highly important to us. Kids should keep their innocence, not be involved in adult mess.", "I\u2019m so sorry, it must be very hard for you. Are you in the uk? I know it sounds scary but social services are actually there to help people and will do relief care, there is help out there even if it\u2019s not from where it should be. \ud83d\udc90", "Why not let him reach out to you? Why are you doing all the chasing to him?", "I'm in Ohio, USA. I was supposed to have the hospital child life team come, but they never showed. We waited 3 hours, and nothing. Unfortunately, that left me to fend for myself.", "Oh this was the final straw, I made it very clear to him and his mother last night. The only updates he will get will be when he reaches out. I'm not chasing, asking, or expecting miracles. I have enough to handle. And since his gf is such a higher priority, then he can treat her as just that."]}
