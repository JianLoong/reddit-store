His father (30yr), has always been a bare minimum father. His child support, involvement, or even asking about him is all at minimum. He has no visitation or rights since we were married, and he told county he didnt want visitation. So, I have to approve all visits. This is his only child. He never calls of work when he is sick, gives excuses why he can't have him on the weekends, etc. However, he has plenty of vacation and PTO to go on vacations 3-4 times a year, but he won't provide anything for his son. If his mother didn't ask for my son, he wouldn't see him. Yes, he still lives with his mom. \nA week ago my son got sick, I tried to care for him, but he needed intense care and fluids. I told his father he was in the hospital, and wouldn't wake up. After hours of intense treatment, his father finally showed up to the hospital, stayed for about 2-3 hours and left. He told me he would be back the next morning, he never showed. The day after he came for another 2 hours, and left. Work was more important, and he didn't want to call off. He made a joke that one day off would shorten my child support payment, I told him I didn't care about child support, I needed a break and his son needed him. Two more days go by, everyone knows how my son is doing but his father. Finally, Sunday came. My ex's first off day since our son was admitted. Surely he would be there! Nope! He went to a bar with his gf to watch football and drink the entire day away. My son had to stay another day, he still wasn't improving too well. I called his father, I needed a break, clean clothes, and fresh air. Slurring his words, he tells me that he would be there eventually but no time soon. I told him to not come, especially drunk.  Hours later, 10 at night he comes in with his gf, I've talked to, she's been around my kids, but never met me officially. I was pissed and lost it. I told him to make his gf leave. She said she wasn't going anywhere. I told her she had no relevancy to my son, and had no place in the hospital. My ex stated over and over \"that's my gf\". They've only been together 1 year, and trust me, settling down is not his game. I told them both, that my son have been in the hospital for 5 days, his father has only been there for 4 1/2 hours. So mathematically, that's an F. And now isn't the time to pretend to be daddy to make yourself look good to your gf. Needless to say, she refused to leave. So after a few colorful words, I had her removed, she got agressive. I made him leave too. Sending him off with \"being a father isn't a publicity stunt to get laid, be better to be excused\".

I provided all the info he needed to be there. He chose to not, then come when his mother forced him after drinking. She could have driven him. That's fine. But that's what a waiting room is for. She is a random stranger. She has no place inserting herself in our business", "So sorry that you are misinformed about so many things. But I'll provide insight. \n1. We had an agreement after I left him, anybody around the kids need to meet the other parent out of respect, so we know who is around our child\n2. He did not do that. \n3. I let be willy nilly in my son's life, paying bare minimum child, and don't ask much of anything from him, due to the fact that he cries and complains anytime I ask him for anything \n4. The one thing no one on earth can call me is a bitter baby momma. I don't care nothing about his activities unless it keeps him from being a father. Which it is\n5. I want him to grow up and be happy with a woman. He is immature, can never commit, and isn't reliable for his own mother (her words). Maybe the right woman will get him right. I don't have time for the project. \n6. Now I figure you don't work at a hospital. Fortunately for you, I do. The pediatric unit is a locked unit to protect the children there from anyone walking on or leaving. Visiting hours end at 8pm for anyone not a parent. They came at 10. I do not know her, her place was to not be in the affairs of my son and his father. And yes they talked for a year. She didn't live here, they've only been together in person since August. \n7. So I have every right to dictate who is, and is not there.  And I am not comfortable with a stranger being in my son's hospital room at 10 or whatever time of day, since im the only legal parent, i have that right. And no, the doctors don't hate me. They actually apologized to me for letting someone on to the unit that was not on the visitors list. That is a safety violation. \n8. So news flash! I did everything within my right. He has no rights, and his gf is irrelevant. If I ask you to leave, as a gf, refusal is not an option for you.", ">Unfortunately, you seem very bothered by his girlfriend. What reason was there to have her leave\n\nWhat reason was she there other than to provide a ride for the **drunk** deadbeat dad?!  GF have no familial connection to this child, she's not even **drunk deadbeat dad's** wife? And how much time have GF even spent with this child, does she even know this child or does she only know of him?  No OP doesn't sound like a BBM but a mother who is trying to keep door open for the Dad to be involved with their son.  And you think 4 hours total is enough time to spend with your child that's in critical condition?  Wow, just Wow!", "They know that. That's why he had to leave, whether he liked it or not. The gf wasn't on the visitors list, I don't even know her name, so I'm not even sure why she was allowed to enter.", "Unfortunately his dad appears not to be a dad to him. Seriously consider this fact that he has only one parent - you! \nA relationship with such an absent father may only cause disappointment later.", "As some with a deadbeat dad who's mom really pushed for a relationship, please stop. He's never going to love your child and you're setting your son up for a lot of trauma. If you keep going he's just going to have lovely memories of his dad using him to get laid, look good in from of people he's trying to impress, or openly admitting that the only reason they spent time together is because his other plans fell through.\n\nGet him in therapy once he's stable at home and drill it into his head that he's a wonderful child, it's not his fault, and a grownup doing the wrong thing doesn't mean there's anything wrong with him. Telling a child \"he just loves you in his own way\" while they're repeatedly stood up/left behind by a parent opens the door for them to be mistreated by others because you've normalized that behavior for them.", "He needed his *mother* there, not his sperm donor.\n\nYou were absolutely right kicking out the drunk sperm donor and his GF, especially when it was after hours. \n\nBut if you need to go home and shower and get clothes, you should call the grandparents who actually have a relationship with your son to come spot you for a few hours. That way when your kiddo needs emotional support, he's with someone he's bonded with and trusts. That's not your ex. \n\nAt this point your ex is a CS check and nothing more. It sucks. He's an ass.

As far father not being there, yeah that\u2019s BS. My kids father says the same thing and I kept telling him why is he continuing the cycle and trauma?  He didn\u2019t like that as a kid so why put his kids through that?\n\nThat\u2019s not an excuse that\u2019s just straight BS.

He goes out, travel, whatever,  that's fine. My kids and I do the same without him. I have every right to say \"you haven't been there, he is sick, come be with him\". I have that right. Him not showing up is his. But refusing to show up then finally showing up with a random chick is not acceptable at all no matter where you are. My kids come first. They have me all of the time. They deserve somewhat of a father too", "Yeah, I got that vibe too. Hopefully, she heals one day, so she can find love.", "I am.", "I hate to break it to you but your ex is never going to grow up.", "Ask the hospital if they have a chaplain and social worker on staff.

It's not on you to try to force a parent to **be a parent**!  I could understand people saying this **if** you were constantly and actively trying to keep your baby's daddy away from your child.  I am telling you this as I was once you.  My son was born with Tetralogy of Fallot, he was hospitalized twice for pediatric surgeons to perform cardiac caths and then he had open heart surgery all by the time he turned two years old.  I learnt after the two cardiac caths that I was all on my own and that my asking and begging his father to come was useless.  So I was alone when my son had his open heart surgery, his father never came and I lived two weeks in that hospital room with my son.  I did manage to go home to shower and change and went directly back to the hospital.\n\nSo in the future, stop begging your baby's daddy to be a dad and if anyone says anything to you, you either ignore them because you know the truth and that's all that matter or you tell them that you can't force a grown man to perform his fatherly duties and you are tired of trying.", "That\u2019s not true at all.

I am not surprised you are having baby daddy drama, as that is what this type of temperament get you. \n\nI mean, no disrespect, but your combative way of dealing with anyone who disagrees with you will make coparenting almost impossible.
