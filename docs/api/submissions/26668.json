His father (30yr), has always been a bare minimum father. His child support, involvement, or even asking about him is all at minimum. He has no visitation or rights since we were married, and he told county he didnt want visitation. So, I have to approve all visits. This is his only child. He never calls of work when he is sick, gives excuses why he can't have him on the weekends, etc. However, he has plenty of vacation and PTO to go on vacations 3-4 times a year, but he won't provide anything for his son. If his mother didn't ask for my son, he wouldn't see him. Yes, he still lives with his mom. \nA week ago my son got sick, I tried to care for him, but he needed intense care and fluids. I told his father he was in the hospital, and wouldn't wake up. After hours of intense treatment, his father finally showed up to the hospital, stayed for about 2-3 hours and left. He told me he would be back the next morning, he never showed. The day after he came for another 2 hours, and left. Work was more important, and he didn't want to call off. He made a joke that one day off would shorten my child support payment, I told him I didn't care about child support, I needed a break and his son needed him. Two more days go by, everyone knows how my son is doing but his father. Finally, Sunday came. My ex's first off day since our son was admitted. Surely he would be there! Nope! He went to a bar with his gf to watch football and drink the entire day away. My son had to stay another day, he still wasn't improving too well. I called his father, I needed a break, clean clothes, and fresh air. Slurring his words, he tells me that he would be there eventually but no time soon. I told him to not come, especially drunk.  Hours later, 10 at night he comes in with his gf, I've talked to, she's been around my kids, but never met me officially. I was pissed and lost it. I told him to make his gf leave. She said she wasn't going anywhere. I told her she had no relevancy to my son, and had no place in the hospital. My ex stated over and over \"that's my gf\". They've only been together 1 year, and trust me, settling down is not his game. I told them both, that my son have been in the hospital for 5 days, his father has only been there for 4 1/2 hours. So mathematically, that's an F. And now isn't the time to pretend to be daddy to make yourself look good to your gf. Needless to say, she refused to leave. So after a few colorful words, I had her removed, she got agressive. I made him leave too. Sending him off with \"being a father isn't a publicity stunt to get laid, be better to be excused\".

I provided all the info he needed to be there. He chose to not, then come when his mother forced him after drinking. She could have driven him. That's fine. But that's what a waiting room is for. She is a random stranger. She has no place inserting herself in our business", "So sorry that you are misinformed about so many things. But I'll provide insight. \n1. We had an agreement after I left him, anybody around the kids need to meet the other parent out of respect, so we know who is around our child\n2. He did not do that. \n3. I let be willy nilly in my son's life, paying bare minimum child, and don't ask much of anything from him, due to the fact that he cries and complains anytime I ask him for anything \n4. The one thing no one on earth can call me is a bitter baby momma. I don't care nothing about his activities unless it keeps him from being a father. Which it is\n5. I want him to grow up and be happy with a woman. He is immature, can never commit, and isn't reliable for his own mother (her words). Maybe the right woman will get him right. I don't have time for the project. \n6. Now I figure you don't work at a hospital. Fortunately for you, I do. The pediatric unit is a locked unit to protect the children there from anyone walking on or leaving. Visiting hours end at 8pm for anyone not a parent. They came at 10. I do not know her, her place was to not be in the affairs of my son and his father. And yes they talked for a year. She didn't live here, they've only been together in person since August. \n7. So I have every right to dictate who is, and is not there.  And I am not comfortable with a stranger being in my son's hospital room at 10 or whatever time of day, since im the only legal parent, i have that right. And no, the doctors don't hate me. They actually apologized to me for letting someone on to the unit that was not on the visitors list. That is a safety violation. \n8. So news flash! I did everything within my right. He has no rights, and his gf is irrelevant. If I ask you to leave, as a gf, refusal is not an option for you.", ">Unfortunately, you seem very bothered by his girlfriend. What reason was there to have her leave\n\nWhat reason was she there other than to provide a ride for the **drunk** deadbeat dad?!  GF have no familial connection to this child, she's not even **drunk deadbeat dad's** wife? And how much time have GF even spent with this child, does she even know this child or does she only know of him?  No OP doesn't sound like a BBM but a mother who is trying to keep door open for the Dad to be involved with their son.  And you think 4 hours total is enough time to spend with your child that's in critical condition?  Wow, just Wow!", "They know that. That's why he had to leave, whether he liked it or not. The gf wasn't on the visitors list, I don't even know her name, so I'm not even sure why she was allowed to enter.", "Unfortunately his dad appears not to be a dad to him. Seriously consider this fact that he has only one parent - you! \nA relationship with such an absent father may only cause disappointment later.", "As some with a deadbeat dad who's mom really pushed for a relationship, please stop. He's never going to love your child and you're setting your son up for a lot of trauma. If you keep going he's just going to have lovely memories of his dad using him to get laid, look good in from of people he's trying to impress, or openly admitting that the only reason they spent time together is because his other plans fell through.\n\nGet him in therapy once he's stable at home and drill it into his head that he's a wonderful child, it's not his fault, and a grownup doing the wrong thing doesn't mean there's anything wrong with him. Telling a child \"he just loves you in his own way\" while they're repeatedly stood up/left behind by a parent opens the door for them to be mistreated by others because you've normalized that behavior for them.", "He needed his *mother* there, not his sperm donor.\n\nYou were absolutely right kicking out the drunk sperm donor and his GF, especially when it was after hours. \n\nBut if you need to go home and shower and get clothes, you should call the grandparents who actually have a relationship with your son to come spot you for a few hours. That way when your kiddo needs emotional support, he's with someone he's bonded with and trusts. That's not your ex. \n\nAt this point your ex is a CS check and nothing more. It sucks. He's an ass.

As far father not being there, yeah that\u2019s BS. My kids father says the same thing and I kept telling him why is he continuing the cycle and trauma?  He didn\u2019t like that as a kid so why put his kids through that?\n\nThat\u2019s not an excuse that\u2019s just straight BS.

He goes out, travel, whatever,  that's fine. My kids and I do the same without him. I have every right to say \"you haven't been there, he is sick, come be with him\". I have that right. Him not showing up is his. But refusing to show up then finally showing up with a random chick is not acceptable at all no matter where you are. My kids come first. They have me all of the time.

It's not on you to try to force a parent to **be a parent**!  I could understand people saying this **if** you were constantly and actively trying to keep your baby's daddy away from your child.  I am telling you this as I was once you.  My son was born with Tetralogy of Fallot, he was hospitalized twice for pediatric surgeons to perform cardiac caths and then he had open heart surgery all by the time he turned two years old.  I learnt after the two cardiac caths that I was all on my own and that my asking and begging his father to come was useless.  So I was alone when my son had his open heart surgery, his father never came and I lived two weeks in that hospital room with my son.  I did manage to go home to shower and change and went directly back to the hospital.\n\nSo in the future, stop begging your baby's daddy to be a dad and if anyone says anything to you, you either ignore them because you know the truth and that's all that matter or you tell them that you can't force a grown man to perform his fatherly duties and you are tired of trying.", "That\u2019s not true at all.

That\u2019s such a scary experience you don\u2019t need to involve this AH deadbeat father anymore.", "NTA. Hey, barely shows or even once the child, and hes got the nerve to bring his girlfriend to your son's hospital room! Talk about an insult! You tell him that unless he is willing to be a real dad, steppa, and help you out during this drastic time.  , don't never come around period", "NTA\n\nAlmost funny that she didn't realize that you could have her removed. I hope some of what you said sunk into her. Because this could be her if she gets pregnant by your ex.\n\nGlad to hear that your son is getting better.", "He sucks. But it really isnt abt him. Its abt what is best for your son. A yr is nothing to sneeze at relationship wise, if you try to control too much, i can see it pushing someone away. You dont give enough info to know if thats a pattern. But going w nta because his pattern dec sucks", "NTA. Limit his visitation right and get even more monet. He doesn't show up anyway. Set up time for his grandma to have him", "Sweetie.  You baby\u2019s daddy is never going to be there for you.  He has shown you that over and over again. He is not your support system.  You will have to build a support system.  \n\nTake it from another single parent who had a baby\u2019s daddy just like yours-it will not get better. Letting that man bounce in and out of your child\u2019s life will set your child up for a lifetime of disappointment and feelings of failure. Your child would be better off without that.\n\nYou cannot make a man be a father. You can beg; you can plead; you can bribe, and nothing will make someone be a father when they don\u2019t want to be a father. \n\nThe best you can do is to make sure he honors his financial obligations. If you have a court order and he is not paying then you need to take him back to court. Stop asking him to be in your life because he\u2019s not coming back to you .\n\nRemember, actions speak louder than words.", "NTA - for your child's sake please keep the father away from him, he is young enough that he will forget about him and a barely there father that doesn't want to be around will be more damaging to your son than no father at all. You gave the guy a chance and he didn't show up even when your son was in a serious condition, so that should be the end of it. Maybe when your son turns 18 he can reach out to him and build a relationship with him, but until then you need to protect your son from him.", "Nta. I really hope your son is doing better.  That sounds like an absolute nightmare.  Be strong mama. You got this.", "Ug", "NTAH. His dad is a piece of work. It\u2019s not a date. It\u2019s a hospital.", "Nta. My ex only shows up when he has a new gf he is trying to impress. There have been so many. Only one gf had my respect. She actually listened when I told her I was afraid my kids would get attached to her and then be heartbroken when things didn't work out. She worked really hard to make sure she didn't step over the boundary and to this day I feel she would have been a wonderful stepmom. But he has an addiction and so we both knew it wouldn't be long until he effed up. I hate parents that just see their children as a tool to use. Good job standing your ground mom.", "NTA. \nHe's not a father!!! You need to cut him off. It's hard, but it's better for you and your son. He's not visiting, he's not paying child support... at this point he's just a sperm donor.", "OP. You\u2019re NTA. Please take something I\u2019ve had to learn for myself, an absent parent is better than an inconsistent one. \nDon\u2019t force your sons father to parent, your son will realize it on his own. There is less pain with an absent parent, less broken promises.", "NTA", "NTA. Who needs a dad like that?", "I\u2019ve always thought what kind of woman dates a man who has abandoned his kids? It takes a special kind of messed up person to do this. NTA", "NTA\nBut I\u2019m bemused that you expected anything different from \u2018dad\u2019.\nHe has clearly shown for 3 years he is uninterested. Why did you expect him to suddenly change years of behavior because now his son is sick? \nStop including him, stop expecting anything other than nothing. That way if he does \u2018something\u2019 it will be a (maybe) nice surprise.\nEqually you need to raise you child independent of his father. In other words do not let his dad promise things & then weasel out of them. If your son has no expectations at all of his father he cannot be let down or disappointed. It\u2019s also very important that your son be told & reinforced that his fathers behaviour is not a reflection of him (the child) as a person.", "NTA. Is he paying his child support? I\u2019d go back for full custody and ask for modified support. \n\nStop calling him. Always use text or email or preferably a court approved messaging app so you can have a record of his time", "Reading through your comments, you seem really stuck on the concept of kids needing both parents. As the child of someone who didn't want to be a parent, but had two kids anyway, your son is better off not spending time around someone who clearly doesn't want him. It causes a lot of psychological damage and will greatly affect his relationships with other people in the future. Even at his young age, your son will pick up on his father's feelings. As many people have said, I would suggest you stop visits until his father wants to be a parent.\n\nYou said you needed a break and I understand that you would be felt more comfortable with someone you knew to stick around while you were gone, but from your description of the guy, the nurses would've been better.", "I occasionally call him to keep him in the loop, I feel  like that's the right/ mature thing to do. But after this event plus all other bs situations, my son is better off with my side of the family. Just hoping he will grow up and get the picture that his son will notice his absence.", "Thank you!", "My son is doing better. He is still coming around. We are trying to see if he can maintain fluids on his own at this point. It'll be a rough healing period. But his spirits are great!!", "I just told my mom that!!", "Yes, but he only has one parent. Please stop trying to make this deadbeat sperm donor a dad.", "It sucks your kids dad is a dud, but nothing you have control over now will ever make the slightest change to that. You\u2019re going to do more damage to your son\u2019s childhood by trying to force this relationship, than by just letting the Sperm Bank remove himself from the equation.", "YTA in this situation. You know his father is useless yet you insist on pulling him in to the hospital on the basis that he's a parent. Father is a fact, but parent is an action -- and he's no parent. You created your own problem here. So yes, you ARE wrong. \n\nStop calling him. Cut ties, except for court-ordered financial support. Move on. You chose a crap person to father your son. Don't drag yourself down further by refusing to let him go. And you're living in dreamland if you think you're going to change him. \n\nIt an AH move to use your child as a weapon to force an action, and that's what you're doing, with a side helping of martyrdom. YTA", "Yes I understand that. Sadly a lot of ppl Never grow up. Your son will and he will absolutely know who took care of him. My Dad was a lot like your ex. It was so bad that even as a kid I knew I couldn\u2019t depend on him for Anything. And that never changed. Just do your best and love your little boy. \u2764\ufe0f", "Oh my, poor baby. My little guy was in the NICU for a month and half (full term, birth trauma) and it\u2019s just horrible. So happy he\u2019s doing better and hoping he\u2019s home soon. Little boys are fighters!", "Child of a deadbeat dad too, thank you so much for explaining all of this.", "Another child of a lousy father and mom of kids with a lousy/absent/abusive father.  I also appreciate the explanation of this.\n\nOP - All kids really need is one solid parent to turn out alright (I have that on good authority from multiple psychologists who specialize in trauma). Stop facilitating his failure because you\u2019ll eventually start gaslighting your son without meaning to.  You\u2019ll cause more damage than you would by just letting go of the expectations.\n\nEdit: wording", "I'm glad it resonated with you! I'm still working through being conditioned to accept horrible behavior/abuse from friends, family, and romantic partners. The small grace I've experienced was rushing to therapy as soon as I could. I've been listening to this album all day and highly recommend Rent as well as Okay Okay by LIGHTS (even if you just skim the lyrics). Both hit me in my trauma in a healing way and are my favorites off of PEP!", "You\u2019re delulu if you see this drunk, belligerent tool in your kid\u2019s hospital room and think \u201cyea one day he\u2019ll change.\u201d \n\nBoth you & the kid belong in therapy ASAP.", "It\u2019s been 3 years, he isn\u2019t going to change. IF he ever does it\u2019ll be long after the damage has already been done to your son.", "I mean this from a place of care and concern for you and your son: he's a 30 year old man. He's already grown up. This is as good as he's going to be and it's not good enough. Your son is young enough that he might yet not have a lot of trauma around his father. But if you try to force this man to be around, it will hurt your son at some point.", "Unfortunately you are missing the point again. He got this bad because, I can admit, I let him. I enabled lazy behavior and didn't care about his negligence because I managed just fine as is. My attitude or demeanor is not the question. I am fed up, very tired, and over being disrespected by less than parents that never made a sacrifice that didn't benefit them. I have the right to be reactive and speak my mind when I'm fed up. And as a single mother, I have the right to be fed up. Him and I got along so well for so long because I let him live free in a unfree world with no consequence or attitude. I don't hate my ex. No one has that power over me. But I can, as a mother, open the door for a relationship, and shut it if I feel my child needs to be guarded from lazy generational curses. So no, I'm not combative. I'm a mother, that makes something out of nothing, provided miracles, and give my kids a good life with all they need. So excuse me if I'm upset if I'm potty training a 3 yr old boy, I'm asking his father for help, and he tells me he'll do it if he thinks about it. Or if I ask for a night off in 2-3 months after asking him for nothing and his response is \"I'm going drinking with my friends, call my mom to figure that out\". I'm no confrontational, combative, or pissed, but best believe I could be, and if I was, I have that right.", "I know this is hard for you but you really need to leave this attitude behind.  Stop putting in extra effort on his behalf, it\u2019s not going anywhere for you or even your son.  There\u2019s no expectation for you to do anything.  If you truly want to leave the door open and be a neutral party, do nothing or abide by the court order, nothing more nothing less.  If your son is sick etc it\u2019s not your job to inform your ex if he\u2019s not on an emergency list or helpful in any way.  Sure there\u2019s a double standard and life sucks sometimes but you don\u2019t get imaginary karma points for letting people take advantage of you or benefit from your generosity without any reciprocation or effort on their part, and at a certain point engaging in that behavior hurts you and your son.", "Why in the fuck do you care what society thinks/ are they raising your son paying your bills/ all that matters is your son and mental and physical well-being/ I kinda think you are using your son and the situation to try and get him back"]}
