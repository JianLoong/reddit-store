{"id": 14918, "submission_id": "12norlv", "title": "AITA for telling a little girl not to touch the merchandise because it was $1400?", "selftext": "I (24F) work in a high end mall and the store I work at sells different name brands such as Chanel, Gucci, etc. A family came in 2 women, 1 man, 1 kid (8yrs?), and a baby. They came when the store was half an hour away from closing. They were the only customers and my coworker was helping them. While they were looking around, I started closing procedures.\n\nI was cleaning the floor, saw their daughter almost stretch a pair of Cartier sunglasses ($1400) and as I was coming by, I took the glasses from her hands and told her, \"Oh let's try to be careful with these! Try not to touch it cause it's Cartier, ok?\" (We have had incidents in the past, children would stretch glasses making them unsellable). She said nothing and ran off to her parents. I put the glasses back on display, thought nothing of it and continued cleaning.\n\n20 minutes later, I was closing one of the registers when the family comes to check out. Suddenly I hear, \"If you have a problem with my kid, you talk to me, not to them\". I looked up because I was confused as to what he was talking about. \"I'm sorry?\". He repeats himself, getting angrier. I guess I was still looking confused cause one of the women (I assume her mom) reinforced what the he had said \"You don't talk to my kid if you have a problem. You talk to the parents! Don't talk to my kid!\". It clicked that this were the parents of the kid.\n\nI started apologizing \"Oh I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to disrespect you\". As the mom is chewing me out, the dad walks over to the display, grabs the glasses, slams them on the counter, and says that they're getting this too. They assumed I told their daughter not to touch it because they *wouldn't be able to afford it.* The mom starts talking in Spanish to my coworker while their entire family is giving me stinkeye. I'm just standing there, fuming inside because I still believe that I didn't do anything wrong. I finished counting the register, and walked away while they kept talking about me in Spanish. As they left, I apologized again, \"I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to disrespect you guys\", and I saw them smirk.\n\nWhen we locked up the doors, the situation began to sink in, and I started ranting. I could understand if I had yelled at their child or quickly grabbed the glasses away from her, but I did none of those things. If they had confronted me right after the situation happened, I would be more understanding. I asked my coworker if what I did was wrong and she agreed with me, adding that she was extremely surprised to see how the family reacted as well (In my store, I'm known as the 'nice' salesperson).\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nTLDR; Family with kid comes into store. Kid plays with expensive merchandise. I tell her to be careful and take it away from her (gently). Family yells at me while checking out, and adds said expensive merchandise to prove a point.
