If you all keep bailing him out, you are enabling him to never grow up. We had to kind of do this with my brother.

The fact he's had 24 jobs in 12 years will be what keeps him from getting a job!

Oh no. /s", "Either way - he's been coddled a little too much and you'd be doing him a favour by not perpetuating that."]}
