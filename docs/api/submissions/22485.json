If he\u2019s still partying at 30 and a job is getting in the way of that, then he\u2019s probably smoking something stronger than weed and using that as an excuse or cover.

He's addicted to mooching, IDK if there's a 12 step program for that.", "So long story short he went into how I \u201cchose\u201d to stick with a career. He said that I would never live life to the fullest and that he might not have money but life experiences. I told him that I\u2019ve helped him enough in the past to include getting him a job, which he subsequently quit in less than 3 months. \n\nThis is where the overtime part kicks in and where it got heated. I work upwards of 10-20 hrs of overtime a week to pay off debts that my wife has accumulated. I also use this overtime to buy nice things for myself when I can save enough. He proceeded to say that if I could work an extra 10 hours a week(so we\u2019re talking probably 30 hours in total some weeks) that \u201cwe\u201d could pay his truck payment and living cost for staying with me. I\u2019m the meantime he would use whatever warning he made to set himself up. He also said I didn\u2019t need to save as much or buy things I wanted and that he was my brother and brothers make sacrifices for family. I was totally taken aback. I told him that he was delusional and that I would not work extra to support his lifestyle. He began screaming and kicking my coffee table and saying how hard his life is and how no one supports him. This despite every other family member taking him in AND paying for things before he quickly wears out his welcome. He has been coddled for a long time. \n\nHe refused to leave my home and was yelling to the point my children could be heard crying in the other room. I on my end did not say much. My brother is one of those people that likes the sound of his own sob story. I held the door open and told him he could leave on his own or in cuffs and that I could care less anymore.", "Bottom line:\nOp does not want a mooch on his couch. Everything else is immaterial. \n\nIf that is how you roll, good for you", "Yes, \"things got heated\" is pretty mysterious. It could really go either way.\n\nETA per OP's clarification, it was the brother who got \"heated\" and violent so yeah NTA. To be clear there was never a world where OP was obligated to take him and and work overtime, it was more \"did OP violently overreact\" and it sounds like no they did not.", "He probably didn't, but he told everyone he did.  Or else one of the relatives foolishly recommended him for the job.", "No mental illness. Just a warped sense of entitlement. His whole mantra is party, alcohol, and weed.
