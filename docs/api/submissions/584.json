We haven\u2019t always seen eye to eye but we had a great friendship. Recently, I joined the military, got married, and then was sent to do more training. I was granted leave to do RA. I got home but was limited on time, managing work and family/husband- it was a 7 AM to about 5 PM work day. I really did want to see my best friend and really wanted to surprise her. After a few days of being home and after work, I got her favorite snacks, and left them on her doorstep. I should have planned better, but I thought if I tell her I\u2019m here I\u2019m going to end up staying later than I\u2019m supposed to and I have a long drive home and work in the morning- Initially, I was trying to surprise her entirely and I told her the snacks were a delivery service, but she could tell I was driving and ended up telling her I was home. I could tell she was hurt from not telling I came home, but we made plans for the following day. The plan was I would go with family to Costco in the AM, after that going to have lunch, and then I would make my way to her house to hang. She agreed, said it worked out perfect because she didn\u2019t have plans/kids that day. The Costco in town was too packed and my family/husband opted for a different Costco. It set our time back by a few hours, Instead of being done around noon, we got done at three. I texted my friend I was on my way, but she was irritated and she was going to go to the gym and would hang after. I didn\u2019t mind, I hated I was late and felt bad. When we finally did hang I could tell that she was still upset, but eventually she seemed fine and we\u2019re happy to see each other. The next day I asked if she wanted to hang just me and her to make up for being late, she said she didn\u2019t want to see me and shouldn\u2019t have to explain what I did wrong because we\u2019ve been friends for so long and I should know better. I agree I should have communicated better, however, I made a point to make time for her. And for context, since high school, Im always late. Unless it is work, I can never seem to be on time. it\u2019s a long-standing joke everyone has to tell me to be earlier than set time to a function or I\u2019ll be late. I\u2019m not saying me being late is OK, I understand its frustrating if someone is on a specific timeline and having to wait, but it\u2019s a habit I\u2019ve always had. Personally, maybe I\u2019m biased, being late or changing plans has never bothered me. I am spontaneous, I can be impulsive, and do things quickly and when I feel like it- my best friend can\u2019t because of her kids, she has structure, more responsibility and has to time things accordingly. Aftermath: a month of silence, she texted and said she didn\u2019t want to be best friends anymore because I didn\u2019t prioritize her or her feelings. This made me mad, even though I was late (which I could not control) I still made an effort to see her and tried to make it up to her.", "created_utc": 1667163726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhpu1m/aita_for_not_hanging_out_with_my_bestie/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ultimately, I think I wanted to hold onto the relationship more because of time invested than actually valuing the friendship. She\u2019s a good person but it\u2019s a lot of theatrics with her and I\u2019m more of a \u201ccarefree\u201d person, life is too short and I I am of the opinion, if after 15 years of friendship this event (which, let\u2019s be honest, is not really that big of a deal) is The straw that broke the camels back, I think I\u2019m going to be just fine moving on.", "I had a similar friendship that started when we were in a particularly intense phase of life (ie: teenagers), but as we grew into adulthood, I realized that she never grew out of that kind of emotional intensity, and hanging out with her as an adult became akin to walking on eggshells. I am still friendly, but don\u2019t put effort into the relationship anymore because I find it unnecessary exhausting and borderline toxic. It\u2019s a strange thing to have happen with someone who you were so close with.", "Yes, it\u2019s not a good feeling honestly. I do love and care about her and what goes on in her life but, I think that is exactly what I need to do, be friends from afar essentially."]}
