When we first met he told me in the first conversation that he was autistic. I\u2019m completely fine with this and it doesn\u2019t effect our relationship however early on I realised he cannot detect sarcasm. I\u2019m British and sarcasm comes to me as a second language as its just our humour. It\u2019s banter. So I suggested using tone indicators for him to make him more comfortable and allow him to understand my humour a little better. He says its really helped him when it comes to understanding conversations. \n\nFor context, tone indictors are little symbols you put at the end of messages to make it clear what you mean when it may not be clear. E.g: /j when you\u2019re joking or being sarcastic or /srs when you\u2019re being serious. Some people think they\u2019re dumb but they genuinely do help those who don\u2019t understand social cues. \n\nA friend of mine however (also 19f) who I will call H, had a lot to say about this. H has met my bf a couple times and has never had a problem with him. She didn\u2019t know he was autistic until while we were out the other day and I picked up my phone to send a funny picture to my bf of us. When I was texting him back, H asked what the tone indicators were, I told her they were little signs I put at the end of messages so my bf doesn\u2019t get confused. She asked why, and I told her its because he is autistic and struggles to understand the tone of messages some times. She sort of laughed and then didn\u2019t mention it anymore. \n\nWe continued talking and drinking and suddenly when I was messaging him back she jumped in and said that the indicators really weren\u2019t necessary because my bf is not autistic. I assured her he is and she said even if he is surely it would be better to not use them so he can learn things like sarcasm. I told her it doesn\u2019t work like that but she got angry and told me she doesn\u2019t care and that its counter productive. I left half an hour after this because it got awkward. \n\nWhen I got home my bf called me to say that H had messaged him on instagram and called him stupid for not being able to understand something like sarcasm. He blocked her but my bf got upset and said that using the indictors was a stupid idea and we never should have used them in the first place. I told him they aren\u2019t stupid and they help him but he\u2019s upset because I was the one who suggest them. So AITA for using indicators???\n\n\nEDIT: Some people seem to think I would keep H in my life after she said this. I haven\u2019t. We haven\u2019t spoken in a week, my boyfriend is okay but her comments have still left him upset and I still feel like a bit of an AH. H has never said anything like this before and I didn\u2019t know she was ableist.", "created_utc": 1685796503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zbvjq/aita_for_using_tone_indictors_when_talking_to_my/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
