When we first met he told me in the first conversation that he was autistic. I\u2019m completely fine with this and it doesn\u2019t effect our relationship however early on I realised he cannot detect sarcasm. I\u2019m British and sarcasm comes to me as a second language as its just our humour. It\u2019s banter. So I suggested using tone indicators for him to make him more comfortable and allow him to understand my humour a little better. He says its really helped him when it comes to understanding conversations. \n\nFor context, tone indictors are little symbols you put at the end of messages to make it clear what you mean when it may not be clear. E.g: /j when you\u2019re joking or being sarcastic or /srs when you\u2019re being serious. Some people think they\u2019re dumb but they genuinely do help those who don\u2019t understand social cues. \n\nA friend of mine however (also 19f) who I will call H, had a lot to say about this. H has met my bf a couple times and has never had a problem with him. She didn\u2019t know he was autistic until while we were out the other day and I picked up my phone to send a funny picture to my bf of us. When I was texting him back, H asked what the tone indicators were, I told her they were little signs I put at the end of messages so my bf doesn\u2019t get confused. She asked why, and I told her its because he is autistic and struggles to understand the tone of messages some times. She sort of laughed and then didn\u2019t mention it anymore. \n\nWe continued talking and drinking and suddenly when I was messaging him back she jumped in and said that the indicators really weren\u2019t necessary because my bf is not autistic. I assured her he is and she said even if he is surely it would be better to not use them so he can learn things like sarcasm. I told her it doesn\u2019t work like that but she got angry and told me she doesn\u2019t care and that its counter productive. I left half an hour after this because it got awkward. \n\nWhen I got home my bf called me to say that H had messaged him on instagram and called him stupid for not being able to understand something like sarcasm. He blocked her but my bf got upset and said that using the indictors was a stupid idea and we never should have used them in the first place. I told him they aren\u2019t stupid and they help him but he\u2019s upset because I was the one who suggest them. So AITA for using indicators???\n\n\nEDIT: Some people seem to think I would keep H in my life after she said this. I haven\u2019t. We haven\u2019t spoken in a week, my boyfriend is okay but her comments have still left him upset and I still feel like a bit of an AH. H has never said anything like this before and I didn\u2019t know she was ableist.", "created_utc": 1685796503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zbvjq/aita_for_using_tone_indictors_when_talking_to_my/", "score": 1357, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Theory 1.) H is projecting. I'm guessing at some point someone in her life refused to accomodate her for something. So seeing you happily and easily make the small accomodation for your bf triggered her. She chose to handle that by lashing out at you and then going out of her way to abuse her bf. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I noticed when I was the ages of 18-25, these situations happened a lot, people would flip out over something innocuous, before any of us had learnt emotional regulation. The few times when the person didn't take it as far as H and later apologised, it would always be projection. E.g when I was 20 my 21 yr old co-worker found out I didn't date and furiously asked me if I wanted to die alone. The next day she apologised and explained her Mum had said that to her since she was 10, so she was triggered to meet someone unbothered about being single. Clearly H has her own issues and I hope you're able to help your bf accept you don't need to stop using tone indicators because H was raised to believe we shouldn't help each out in this life.\n\nTheory 2: she flirted with your bf.

Tone indicators are good, and you sound like a really nice couple.", "NTA and honestly I love the idea, there are *so* many studies that *everyone* has a much lower rate of accurately interpreting tone via text\n\nOne study I saw recently quoted something like the sender assumes the tone will accurately be interpreted 80% of the time, whereas it can be closer to 57%. This is a huge difference when you are trying to communicate\n\nA couple weeks ago I had a text conversation with someone I've known for a long time and would say we are usually on the same wavelength. They gave me two options for dinner, one was a dish they love to make but I have never tried, the second was just going to to store and winging it. I interpreted this as \"My preference is to make X, but if you don't like that its alright and we can work around it.\" I was hesitant but willing to try it so I said sure sounds good I'd like to try it. Then that night we were all eating (it was v good) and my friend recounted our text convo, which she interpreted it as \"I figured we would just wing it but I was pleasantly surprised when you said you'd like to try X so then I knew we had to do it!\" I sat there realizing we had two *very* different thought processes and perceptions of this conversation \n\nSince texting is so susceptible to misinterpretation, I prefer not to 90% of the time. Its great for making plans and logistics, but there are very few people I will just text on end. You've found a way to improve your communication that works, H had no right to intrude, judge, and shame you and your partner. Some people just don't know how to mind their own business, especially when its shit they clearly know nothing about and doesn't impact them in the slightest", "NTA\nYour friend is the AH for sticking her nose where it doesn\u2019t belong and then her message to your bf was totally rude and uncalled for.

Second, oh hell no to that \"friend\". Id be so livid she completely crushed your bf's confidence", "NTA\n\nSh\\*t, I'm NT and I still misinterpret text tone a lot.
