When we first met he told me in the first conversation that he was autistic. I\u2019m completely fine with this and it doesn\u2019t effect our relationship however early on I realised he cannot detect sarcasm. I\u2019m British and sarcasm comes to me as a second language as its just our humour. It\u2019s banter. So I suggested using tone indicators for him to make him more comfortable and allow him to understand my humour a little better. He says its really helped him when it comes to understanding conversations. \n\nFor context, tone indictors are little symbols you put at the end of messages to make it clear what you mean when it may not be clear. E.g: /j when you\u2019re joking or being sarcastic or /srs when you\u2019re being serious. Some people think they\u2019re dumb but they genuinely do help those who don\u2019t understand social cues. \n\nA friend of mine however (also 19f) who I will call H, had a lot to say about this. H has met my bf a couple times and has never had a problem with him. She didn\u2019t know he was autistic until while we were out the other day and I picked up my phone to send a funny picture to my bf of us. When I was texting him back, H asked what the tone indicators were, I told her they were little signs I put at the end of messages so my bf doesn\u2019t get confused. She asked why, and I told her its because he is autistic and struggles to understand the tone of messages some times. She sort of laughed and then didn\u2019t mention it anymore. \n\nWe continued talking and drinking and suddenly when I was messaging him back she jumped in and said that the indicators really weren\u2019t necessary because my bf is not autistic. I assured her he is and she said even if he is surely it would be better to not use them so he can learn things like sarcasm. I told her it doesn\u2019t work like that but she got angry and told me she doesn\u2019t care and that its counter productive. I left half an hour after this because it got awkward. \n\nWhen I got home my bf called me to say that H had messaged him on instagram and called him stupid for not being able to understand something like sarcasm. He blocked her but my bf got upset and said that using the indictors was a stupid idea and we never should have used them in the first place. I told him they aren\u2019t stupid and they help him but he\u2019s upset because I was the one who suggest them. So AITA for using indicators???\n\n\nEDIT: Some people seem to think I would keep H in my life after she said this. I haven\u2019t. We haven\u2019t spoken in a week, my boyfriend is okay but her comments have still left him upset and I still feel like a bit of an AH.

Theory 1.) H is projecting. I'm guessing at some point someone in her life refused to accomodate her for something. So seeing you happily and easily make the small accomodation for your bf triggered her. She chose to handle that by lashing out at you and then going out of her way to abuse her bf. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I noticed when I was the ages of 18-25, these situations happened a lot, people would flip out over something innocuous, before any of us had learnt emotional regulation. The few times when the person didn't take it as far as H and later apologised, it would always be projection. E.g when I was 20 my 21 yr old co-worker found out I didn't date and furiously asked me if I wanted to die alone. The next day she apologised and explained her Mum had said that to her since she was 10, so she was triggered to meet someone unbothered about being single. Clearly H has her own issues and I hope you're able to help your bf accept you don't need to stop using tone indicators because H was raised to believe we shouldn't help each out in this life.\n\nTheory 2: she flirted with your bf.

Tone indicators are good, and you sound like a really nice couple.", "NTA and honestly I love the idea, there are *so* many studies that *everyone* has a much lower rate of accurately interpreting tone via text\n\nOne study I saw recently quoted something like the sender assumes the tone will accurately be interpreted 80% of the time, whereas it can be closer to 57%. This is a huge difference when you are trying to communicate\n\nA couple weeks ago I had a text conversation with someone I've known for a long time and would say we are usually on the same wavelength. They gave me two options for dinner, one was a dish they love to make but I have never tried, the second was just going to to store and winging it. I interpreted this as \"My preference is to make X, but if you don't like that its alright and we can work around it.\" I was hesitant but willing to try it so I said sure sounds good I'd like to try it. Then that night we were all eating (it was v good) and my friend recounted our text convo, which she interpreted it as \"I figured we would just wing it but I was pleasantly surprised when you said you'd like to try X so then I knew we had to do it!\" I sat there realizing we had two *very* different thought processes and perceptions of this conversation \n\nSince texting is so susceptible to misinterpretation, I prefer not to 90% of the time. Its great for making plans and logistics, but there are very few people I will just text on end. You've found a way to improve your communication that works, H had no right to intrude, judge, and shame you and your partner. Some people just don't know how to mind their own business, especially when its shit they clearly know nothing about and doesn't impact them in the slightest", "NTA\nYour friend is the AH for sticking her nose where it doesn\u2019t belong and then her message to your bf was totally rude and uncalled for.

It\u2019s none of her business how you two communicate, weird that she got into it and tried to give her opinion, and she\u2019s wrong about him being able \u201clearn things like sarcasm\u201d if you take away the only indication you are using it. Never giving any cues would not at all be a help. Like you said, it doesn\u2019t work like that. Then she takes her ableism a step further and becomes a bully, messaging him online after the fact and calling him names. That\u2019s so incredibly cruel, childish, and pathetic; I\u2019m glad she\u2019s no longer in your life. I hope your BF is okay after being harassed, and you\u2019re able to convince him she\u2019s not worth considering the opinion of. You seem like such a lovely and supportive partner, don\u2019t beat yourself up about suggesting using a helpful way to enhance communication. \n\nSeriously, to OP\u2019s BF: I\u2019m 27 and learned this way too slowly: No one\u2019s opinion is worth sacrificing your own accommodations for. What they think of how you make living easier doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m in burnout after masking for years. Don\u2019t torture and squash yourself to make other people think better of you.", "She should have used a tone indicator", "[removed]", "  NTA .People put symbols in text to indicate sarcasm? I\u2019m shocked. /s", "I was wholly unaware that there was a whole system of tone indicators!", "This was my take as well, he was embarrassed and is casting a wide net of blame.  \n\nI\u2019d suggest to meet in the middle.  Normal messages don\u2019t need an indicator, but sarcasm and really serious should keep them.", "I'd agree if she didn't go out of her way to insult the bf and now he's upset about using it because he thinks it makes him stupid.\n\nHonestly, I'm glad she showed her true colors", "nope anyone can use them, though I\u2019ve found autistic people tend to use them more often, they can be pretty helpful in online conversations as sometimes tone is lost", " Second tone can be difficult to translate from text regardless if you are autistic or not so tone indicators aren't a bad idea anyway.", "r/unexpectedfriends", "I've found my people!", "Wrong thread I believe", "Huh?", "NTA - even subtitles use tone indicators, I learned that (!) means sarcasm but that may just be a UK thing...", "That makes sense, just because it's a trait of one thing doesn't mean that it's not seen elsewhere! I have a very dry sarcasm and it works fine in person, but even my family has to question if I'm being serious sometimes. My boss is the same way and I've fallen for it. I've considered using it in texting before as then I can still give a hint of ton.", "I always add emojis just in case. I know it looks silly. But I'd rather look silly than to have someone get upset because they didn't understand how I meant something. I already have tons of people ready to misunderstand everything I say, so definitely not risking it in written form.", "I always appreciate tone indicators. In texts or posts, you can't always be sure what is sarcasm and what's serious.  \n\n\nH is TA. How someone else handles communication in a relationship is between the people IN the relationship and no one else.", "The number of times I've seen people dragged on reddit for something that is seemingly obviously sarcastic because they didnt add \"/s\" at the end indicates that it's not just autistic people who struggle with the ambiguity of text", "How did no one notice that this is a bot comment when it starts they way it does. Comment stolen from [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zbvjq/aita_for_using_tone_indictors_when_talking_to_my/jmqif76?context=3)", "^Seconding this and adding not every person likes to be 'outed' as autistic to others. It's their information to share when they want to. Usually, because something like this happens.", "Which just makes it silly to jump to conclusions instead of asknig first.", "Why I pay $3 a month for Discord Nitro, lol. Gimme all my emojis so I can property sass someone. \ud83e\udd23", "This is a wonderful idea! The shitty friend made him self-conscious bc of the indicators, so maybe emojis would be a good way to use them inconspicuously. Wonderful idea!", "I'm not even autistic and I think tone indicators are helpful. Just like I'm not deaf, but would appreciate a lot more ASL interpretation.", "Your friend getting pissed over it honestly baffles me and slightly destroys my faith in humanity.", "I knew about utilizing jk or /s but I never knew they had an actual term. I learn new stuff all the time and I love it. But I would drop this friend who went out of their way to insult a guy for something he has no control over. It's garbage ableism and bigotry and they should be dropped. NTA but you would be if you don't rip this person a new one and drop them like a bag of crap.\n\nEdit: just saw OPs edit. She dropped H. Ok, good!", "It's why I will die on the hill of ending half my sentences with \"lol\". I also like emojis tho.\n\nLol\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0f", "First NTA at all!!!", "And if I let someone know I'm autistic the first time I meet them, I think it's reasonable to assume I'm \"out\" about it, and it's exactly as valid as describing my hair color.", "I agree with you, because I don't exactly see being autistic as \"news\" like their comment seems to imply that it is.\n\nI always knew I was considered weird, and had a hard time detecting tone or understanding social queues until I learned how to mask. But finally being able to describe *why* others considered me weird was a relief, not something I was ashamed of.\n\nPeople can't tell that I'm autistic anymore simply due to how well I've learned to mask, but I don't exactly see that as a good thing. Neurotypical individuals consistently seem to pity or undervalue those with autism while those of us with it simply see it as a descriptor of who we have always been.\n\nFrankly those who have high symptomology need us with high functionality to embrace the diagnosis and start changing the stigma around it. I don't know OP's boyfriend specifically, but I would wager that he isn't ashamed by his autism either.", ">Just don\u2019t share people\u2019s health information\n\nYou\u2019re assuming you know whether OP\u2019s bf considers this private information better than OP. We share people\u2019s health information all the time and many things are not considered private. \u201cI\u2019m texting my bf not calling because he\u2019s deaf\u201d is sharing people\u2019s health information.", "> You\u2019re assuming you know whether OP\u2019s bf considers this private information better than OP.\n\nWhich is a much safer assumption. If OP's boyfriend doesn't care and the info is not shared, it doesn't matter. If OP's boyfriend DOES care, and the info is shared, the you've got a problem. It's much better to not share the info than it is to share the info as the info isn't even necessary to justify the behavior.", "H has no need to know why the OP used tone indicators. I use them all the time because I want to be understood clearly. OP that's no obligation to explain her reasoning."]}
