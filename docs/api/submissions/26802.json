I told him that it was important that she knew.\n\nLater that night they announced they were ENGAGED! I panicked. I didn't know what to do. I got a lot of advice when I posted, don't tell her, it's not your place, tell her, etc. I was overwhelmed, I had relatives pass while also trying to manage after my bf lost his job. I didn't have the capacity to deal.\n\nHan asked me to be bridesmaid. It meant a lot. I wanted to be there. I would be the only person in our group who would have said no if I did. I said yes.

They wanted me by myself while the rest of our friends would be up at the altar\n\nI said it was their decision, but that also meant I wouldn't go. They wanted me to spend even more money I didn't have. I hung up, Han called me back. She said \"Fine, you can still be a bridesmaid.\" I replied that I wasn't interested. It was sooo important, but after doing it she changed her mind in less than 10 mins. I hung up, she called again. I said I wanted to be alone. She apologized and we hung up.

The way I would have told everyone how they uninvited you and called you those things....", "And this ladies and gentlemen, is why we don't hook up/sleep with our friends.", "Let me get this straight, because your wording is confusing. You and your friend Dave had a threesome once back in the day, and after telling your current bf about it, you're upset and surprised that Dave didn't tell his fiance?\n\nThe fuck is wrong with you? Why in the hell does he have to tell his current partner the shit he did in the past when he was younger, well before they met? It's nobody's business, least of all yours! You gave it a try one time, and nothing came of it. You've since moved on. As Dave clearly has as well.\n\nAm I understanding this right? You're upset that Dave didn't go out of his way to tell his fiance that you fucked once upon a time on one occasion?\n\nIt sounds like Dave finally relented and told his fiance what \"happened\" because he felt pressured from you, as though you implied that if he didn't tell her, you would, because you have this strange fixation that she has a right to know.\n\nI get the concept that being a bridesmaid in a wedding party where you slept with the groom might be a little weird, but you're all adults. Fucking act like it.\n\nLast year my fiance and I went to a wedding of someone she had never met, but was someone I used to spend a fair amount of time with when I was much younger, quite literally half a lifetime ago when we were in our late teens and early 20's. We made out a few times and went as far as 3rd base. I slept with some of her friends, who were also at the wedding. We were all young and horny with raging hormones and everyone was just exploring, as kids do. It didn't mean anything then, and it sure as shit doesn't mean anything now.\n\nAccording to you, was I supposed to sit my fiance down and say \"Okay, so about the bride, we've made out a few times. And maybe a bit more than that. Oh, and you see her over there? We had sex. Her too. But it was 22 years ago\".\n\nNo. Of course not. Because it's in the past and it's entirely irrelevant to the present.\n\nWhat a weird ass post.\n\nYou made it weird, OP. If you had just kept your mouth shut, you could have been a bridesmaid without any issues and supported your friend. But you made it weird and were asked to step down from the position. Frankly I'm surprised you weren't uninvited altogether.", "ESH. \n\nI get it, even if I don't agree.  I think quite a few people wouldn't want somoene their partner slept with in the past to stand up in their wedding.  Dave should've told her earlier.   You IMO overreacted by refusing to go at all.  I guess if you are done with this friendship that was the way to do it.", "ESH - No, Han did not need to know about the threesome. People's past sex lives are exactly that - the past. It seems that this \"one-time\" thing is more important to you than it should be. That's on you, OP. Just because you felt you needed to tell YOUR partner, Dave did not have to tell his. And everybody overreacted to Dave telling Han. Note that she die ask you to be in wedding party again, but you reacted very immaturely. Perhaps all of you should avoid each other. Remember, not every person has to act up to your standards.", "NTA, but also what they did was a reflexive reaction by Han and she quickly apologised. I think it could have been really valuable to actually get together with her and talk it out. I get that it was a shitty reflexive reaction and that's why you're NTA, but it doesn't sound like this had to be a case of it going this far.", "You could have just, initially stfu. Why was it ever a thing you would even guilt d about? She didn't need to know. You blew up your friendship over nothing.\nI woulda paid you half at most.", "ESH, leaning toward YTA.  \n\nI tend to agree that Dave should or could have fully disclosed the past encounter you had to Han, hence the \"ESH\".  But I'm even still on the fence about that. \n\nIn the end, what is important to each individual varies.  My reading of this indicates that, to Dave, that one-time threesome with you long in the past is *utterly irrelevant* to him and has NO bearing on his current friendship with you or his relationship with his GF.  I think it's entirely possible that it's a genuinely unimportant fact to him and there was no reason for him to ever bring it up to his GF.  \n\nIn that world - a world in which you, Dave, and Han are all *truly* happy with your relationships - you could all just live together blissfully ever after without Han ever knowing the irrelevant thing of the past.  \n\nIt was *you*, however, who seemed to still be hung up on that past threesome.  It's in your mind.  You're making it relevant.  If you thought it was a relevant disclosure for your relationship with your BF, that's totally fair.  If it was something you find yourself thinking about and you feared potential awkwardness, or a future moment where it would come out and then you'd have to explain why you had never told your BF, that's logical.  I'd *probably* do the same.  \n\nBut Dave may have not had any of those same feelings or fears regarding it.  For him it may truly have been a thing of the past with no relevant bearing on the present.  It wasn't on you to impose your preferred handling of the situation onto your friend.  YTA for trying to do that. \n\nYou confronted Dave and planted that idea in his head.  If he previously gave the idea no weight, now he did, enough that he, by your own measure, \"did the right thing\" and told Han.  You put the notion of guilt on his conscience, and he did the right thing and told his future wife before getting married.  Then, rather than be proud of Dave for heeding your advice during what was surely a tough conversation for him to have, you took it personally, inferred the least charitable interpretation of Dave's words, made it all about you, and had your own emotional reaction to it.  (There's no way for someone who had a threesome to blame 1 person for the threesome.  By definition, all 3 participants are responsible.  Any notion that Dave somehow shoved responsibility for the threesome onto you alone had to have come from poor telephone communication fused with the emotional coloring you experienced after being told you were demoted in the wedding.)  \n\nIt's completely understandable to be upset for being demoted.  But by your own account, feeling that the threesome information was relevant, I'd expect you to think that Han's reaction was completely understandable.  Take some time to let the emotions settle, then talk about it.  It sounds like that's exactly what Han did (major kudos to her, btw!)  They seemed to have the emotional maturity to let the dust settle and reassess.  You, however, did not.  You escalated the situation and made a part of their *wedding* about you.  Now you're dealing with the aftermath.  \n\nHan and Dave sound reasonable and like they'd still be able to repair the relationship if you wanted.  But it's on you at this point.", "Ngl, I think you overreacted here. You knew Han would be upset about the threesome because you posted about it before. So it's not like it's a shock to you that she's upset about it. Honestly, I think you probably should have told your friend to tell her when you agreed to being a bridesmaid. At the end of the day, the only real asshole is Dave, but I do think by boycotting the wedding you ended the friendship with both if them completely. Which it's unclear if that was what you wanted or not.", "Esh\u2026I do not understand why anyone had to know who you had sex with in college.  You and Dave are not together, decided you were not meant for each other, etc.  You told your boyfriend, ok.  You two are fine knowing that you had a threesome.  But why did Dave\u2019s girlfriend need to know?  Why must it have been told?  Was it going to happen again?  How did he betray his girlfriend but not telling her?  How does that set you up for failure?  If you do not tell someone, they never know.  If you do not discuss it, and why would you?, they never know. Some people can\u2019t handle it and you found out Han was one of those people.  You even said she would not handle it well.

That would have brought all kinds of questions from the wedding guests, then you would have a bit of a spectacle at the actual wedding.\n\nHan changed her mind (OP refused), then changed it back. It didn't sound like she wanted OP to be a BM, and any person who would take that BM gig wouldn't feel welcomed. No one wants that.\n\nAsking for money back is warranted, even if it was OP who chose not to go. Demanding money back took it too far. So YTA for that.\n\nNot going was probably the best choice.\n\nIf you had attended as a bridesmaid (Han: Fine you can be a bridesmaid), bride would have been bothered probably, but no questions would be raised, and bride could have possibly seen that there was nothing going on between you two other than friendship.

You knew she didn't know the truth, knew she deserved the truth, and were apparently close enough with her to be a bridesmaid. Imo, you had 3 options. You could have demanded Dave tell her way earlier than weeks before the wedding, you could have told her yourself in a \"I really care about you as a friend and don't want to hide things from you\" way, or you could have stayed out of it until Dave told her, like you did, but taken Han's valid feelings with grace and understanding and attended the wedding as a guest to support both of your friends. By doing none of that, you just showed Han that you're not a friend of hers. \n\nTo me it seems like Han felt betrayed by both of you for keeping this from her for so long.

I didn't see any comment about her having no money for a new outfit, but I also find that questionable tbh. I don't know anyone who doesn't have a go-to wedding guest outfit or at least an old lbd they can throw on.

They wanted me by myself while the rest of our friends would be up at the altar\"\n\nNTA. This threw me off. Time to block them", "This was NO BIG DEAL WHATSOEVER.  I can't fathom why who had sex with whom matters even one whit as it is ancient history.\n\nI have a good friend Alex who was a bit of a player back in the day. When he got married a couple of years ago I think his previous body count at that point included at least three (possibly four) of the bridesmaids (and I suspect even one groomsman). No one cared at ALL, least of all his wife-to-be, because that was all in the distant past before they even thought about becoming a couple.\n\nAnd how is it that it is \"improper\" for someone \"like you\" to be a bridesmaid, when it's perfectly okay (apparently) for Dave to be a groom???\n\nNTA.", "NOT YOUR FAULT. REPEAT: NOT YOUR FAULT. NTA", "NTA.  I don't know why a one time sexual encounter in college had to be discussed with Han. The comment about \"people like you\" suggests that you no longer have Dave and Han as friends.  If either of them have to gall to say anything to you, remind them that Dave is a person just like you!", "This is a show.", "Smzmz.z.,.,.,.zz..", "probably gonna get downvoted, but ESH, I think you were extremely obnoxious to force your bff to tell her fiancee that you had a threesome with him. That was his decision to make, not yours, so you got what you asked for, and honestly, probably what you wanted, I can't think of a good reason to stir up so much drama other than for the drama itself.\nThen they reacted poorly, but while ESH, I think you sucked more than them in the situation.", "YTA \n\nPersonally I think the invite was still on the table, and you turned it down. So I dont think you should be entitled to a refund. But yeah it is what it is.", "NAH.\n\nYou certainly are under no obligation to go. However, you had a threeesome with the groom, and she is finding out at the last hour. Of course you cannot be in the wedding party. I'm surprised she is even speaking to you. Yuck.", "NTA\n\nDave should have told her.", "NTA.  They both treated you like you were the problem. Dave\u2019s lack of accountability  and honesty were the problem.", "NTA- if it bothered Han so much- why marry him?", "NTA. Han made a snap decision, realized she effed up, but it was too late to undo the damage. & of course she doesn\u2019t want to own up to ruining a near lifelong friendship and fking up her friend group over something that was literally nothing. And it\u2019s real rich that even when called out she still puts all the blame on Dave like she had nothing to do with it. I personally would tell anyone that asked the truth, but I also get why you wouldn\u2019t want to do that. Anyway NTA.", "Kind of the asshole.  Yes, Dave did the wrong thing several times here.  Yes, his wife reacted kinda poorly, but given Dave's mistake, she actually did pretty good.  Sounds like you did pretty good right up until the flounce. \n\nYou guys were best friends for a long time.  I dunno, to me, real friends get through tough shit together. I don't understand people who can throw their most important relationships out the door like this.\n\nIt was a lot for the wife to process.  Dave fucked up and was trying to do right by his soon to be wife.  Sounds like you could have been understanding as his wife adjusted to news she was blindsided by.", "Why the hell did you feel like you had to tell your partners?\n Everyone has a past, and its only the future that belongs to them.", "Replying to you for visibility, thank you for your input.  \n\n\nAdditional INFO: Due to character limit I wasn't able to include this, but in the talk about Han not knowing Dave mentioned that Han had repeatedly asked about us. If HE ever had a crush on me, if we dated, etc. This was all before she met me earlier in their relationship. She didn't know how to feel about a girl bff, so she asked questions and Dave lied by omission. I definitely felt she needed to know BECAUSE of this. He started their relationship on lies at mine and Han's expense. I also felt like it wasn't up to Han to ask him the \"right questions\" he knew exactly what she was trying to ask and he should have been more forthcoming in the beginning.   \n\n\nI agree with the commenters that the past is the past, a ONS that didn't mean anything then doesn't mean anything now. It's not something that bothers me, my own partner has flings/exes he's close with and talks to. It did matter to Han though, and it was obviously something she wanted to know early on. My issue again is the dishonesty and the willingness to throw me under the bus.", "Dave is the raging AH in all of this. Sorry OP.", "I wouldn\u2019t really call it throwing OP under the bus.  They\u2019ve apparently clearly told people that Dave is at fault, not OP.\n\nIf I were a mutual friend \u201cIt\u2019s Dave\u2019s fault, if you want to know ask her,\u201d would leave me thinking that Dave had likely done something much worse, to be honest.  Ask her seems like an acknowledgement that it\u2019s not their right to tell the story if OP doesn\u2019t want the details out there.", "QUESTION: Am I the only one wondering why OP had to share the threesome history with her later BF?  And then expect Dave to share that history with his fianc\u00e9 Han?  Shouldn\u2019t that event just stayed between the three participants?", ">Um.. Like what exactly?\n\nA sexual partner of Daves. Dave cant exactly not go to his own wedding for having had a threesome before.", "It\u2019s more about the lie than about the sex. Just be honest.", "I\u2019m reading this whole post confused, because I don\u2019t even understand why tell Han anything? Especially if it was just a one time thing. It\u2019s so weird to me.", "Almost like its daves own wedding.. Is he supposed to not go to his own wedding? Do you ever think before typing?", "Yep, spread the truth. They practically told OP to. They're relying on her keeping quiet.", "I can definitely see how this could be a normal way of saying that. Thanks for the input. I just personally felt like the tone and how it was said, along with other things that were said during the call, felt like he was absolving himself from the event. Like I was this temptress that manipulated him into doing it, rather than a thing we consensually did as stupid teens.", "Oh my GOD i had to scroll down WAY too far to read this. Thank you!", ">And how is it that it is \"improper\" for someone \"like you\" to be a bridesmaid, when it's perfectly okay (apparently) for Dave to be a groom???\n\nWhy are you the 4th person i have to read this nonsense from. Hes the fucking GROOM. ITS HIS WEDDING. \"someone like you\" is SO OBVIOUSLY meant to be \"A past sexual partner of dave\" PLEASE think.", "I bet it wouldn\u2019t have mattered to Han if Dave had been honest from the beginning. I mean, she may not have liked it and had to think about dating someone who\u2019s so close to a former ONS, but she never got that chance. And I bet his revelation made her wonder what else he may have lied about/omitted. Dave 100% threw you under the bus and you\u2019re NTA, you were justified in your reaction.", "At least you won\u2019t ever have to see them again", ">the past is the past, a ONS that didn't mean anything then doesn't mean anything now.\n\nNTA, but the commenters who\u2019ve said this are definitely assuming their relationship/sexual values are universal. A partner\u2019s sexual history matters a lot to some people, myself included, and because I personally don\u2019t believe in maintaining contact with anyone I\u2019ve slept with aside from my current partner, I would never date or marry someone who felt differently. We\u2019d be inherently incompatible.\n\nDave didn\u2019t tell Han sooner because he wanted to have his cake and eat it, too, and clearly was willing to gamble on Han being so \u201clocked in\u201d to the relationship by the time he told her that she\u2019d bite her tongue until after the wedding. Honestly, I know everything that I need to know about Dave\u2019s character from your posts: he\u2019s manipulative and selfish, and gamed this entire situation to get what he wanted at other people\u2019s expense. If I were in your shoes, that\u2019s not a friend I\u2019d want to have and I probably would\u2019ve dropped him once I knew that he was willing to deceive the person he wanted to marry for as long as he did.", "I think it's more that they had a sexual history and were still friends and nobody told Han. The number of participants is irrelevant.", "Because they are still friends. you want that info out asap so things like this don't happen. If Dave had told his gf when they first started dating, she would have been able to decide if she could handle it or not before being in love with him.", "I think that it is reasonable to give your partner and future spouse a heads up that prior sexual partners are still in your orbit. This is different from requiring a full sexual account of your history. Your partner deserves to know when prior partners are still around.", "I think her sharing it is fine, she can do that if she wants to. Pressuring him to do it is kind of weird as fuck.", "Agreed, but a better way of wording that would be something like 'we don't feel it's appropriate as you're a previous sexual partner of Dave's', which keeps the focus on the circumstances. The 'someone like you' has a shaming connotation like there's something intrinsically wrong with OP and does also distinguish her from Dave even though they both committed the same act.", "honestly in my local queer scene there's a lot of relationships and fucking around, and it sounds ludicrous to be asked to cut off friends just because we touched genitals at one point in time.", "What lie? Why does it matter who you had sex with years ago? That ended. Youre committing youre entire future to this one person. My priority is on my future, not my past.", "I agree. But a lot of people seem to have an issue with past sexual partners remaining friends. At least, thats how it seems in the world of reddit  i dont care about things like that, whats in the past is in the past.", "It's not that obvious at all, and I frankly don't think that's what she meant. In fact I'm pretty sure of it.\n\nAnd I'll happily invite you to keep your suggestion for me to think to yourself. I think plenty.", "For you yes, but people are different.\nAnd I guess that she asked him at one point if they had a sexual relationship.", "They do it to save on the character limit", "Han is garbage. There is zero excuse for her dramatic bullshit\n If she was pissed it should have beem directed at HIM not OP. Han is misogynistic garbage."]}
