Typically, our family is very close. But he reads me and our whole family stories from here often and after a blowup fight he made a rude comment relating to it, so I've decided to post here to try and set him straight. \n\nDespite being an incredibly busy woman, I think it's important to have hobbies you care about. Mine is making bread. I got into the hobby about 8 years ago and have gone from having no clue about anything I was doing and being a bit of a joke, to making amazing loafs my whole family enjoys. \n\nWhen I first started - I was at home a lot because I'd been laid off. Making bread was a way to cut costs, work out, and make food my family would get excited about all at once. My son was 9, I tried to get him involved and he wasn't interested. He avoided the kitchen when I baked (which I don't mind). My daughter, \"Emily\" 14F, was 5 and loved being around the kitchen in any capacity while I was baking. She's grown into a talented baker herself. \n\nMe and Emily often make brioche bread. It's a lot of work and takes a very long time. We prefer our brioche to be extra sweet, and we eat it with sweet toppings and use the leftovers to make sweet dishes like French toast. \n\nI have always made both of my kids nice lunchboxes, I ask them every year if they want me to keep making them lunch or start buying and they pick the lunchboxes because I really care to make them to their tastes. \n\nNow on to the fight - last week my son walked into the kitchen while I was making their lunches for the next day. He saw me making a PB&J for his sister's on leftover brioche and requested I make his ham and cheese on brioche as well. I said I couldn't, because the bread is best used for sweet things and I was already planning on using the rest of the bread for French toast. He got annoyed at this and said I was just playing favorites, to which I told him he was ridiculous and I just didn't want something his sister and I have a pre-established routine with to be disrupted.\n\nI said if he wanted to have his sandwiches on brioche, I could make loafs with him too. He doesn't think he should have to do this, as his sister asks for many things and I don't make her make them from scratch. I didn't budge and neither did he. But they both regularly ask for things, and I'm typically very accommodating for them both. He is 17, he could honestly be doing this all for himself but I get joy from caring for him while I still can. \n\nI thought I was in the right, but it's been days and he's still mad. AITA and blind to it, or have I just spoiled my son?\n\nEdit: From the comments it seems I was unclear. The French toast was for the whole family not just Emily and me.", "created_utc": 1674351887, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10i7t7p/aita_for_refusing_to_make_my_sons_sandwich_on/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The bread has never been reserved solely for yours and Emily\u2019s use before, at least not that you\u2019ve mentioned. You were happy enough to make her a sandwich using your bread, yet denied your son use of it because you decided it wouldn\u2019t taste right, and reserved all the leftovers for something else. This isn\u2019t necessarily solely about bread, OP, it\u2019s about you establishing a boundary seemingly out of the blue with some pretty flimsy justification.

Typically, our family is very close. But he reads me and our whole family stories from here often and after a blowup fight he made a rude comment relating to it, so I've decided to post here to try and set him straight. \n\nDespite being an incredibly busy woman, I think it's important to have hobbies you care about. Mine is making bread. I got into the hobby about 8 years ago and have gone from having no clue about anything I was doing and being a bit of a joke, to making amazing loafs my whole family enjoys. \n\nWhen I first started - I was at home a lot because I'd been laid off. Making bread was a way to cut costs, work out, and make food my family would get excited about all at once. My son was 9, I tried to get him involved and he wasn't interested. He avoided the kitchen when I baked (which I don't mind). My daughter, \"Emily\" 14F, was 5 and loved being around the kitchen in any capacity while I was baking. She's grown into a talented baker herself. \n\nMe and Emily often make brioche bread. It's a lot of work and takes a very long time. We prefer our brioche to be extra sweet, and we eat it with sweet toppings and use the leftovers to make sweet dishes like French toast. \n\nI have always made both of my kids nice lunchboxes, I ask them every year if they want me to keep making them lunch or start buying and they pick the lunchboxes because I really care to make them to their tastes. \n\nNow on to the fight - last week my son walked into the kitchen while I was making their lunches for the next day. He saw me making a PB&J for his sister's on leftover brioche and requested I make his ham and cheese on brioche as well. I said I couldn't, because the bread is best used for sweet things and I was already planning on using the rest of the bread for French toast. He got annoyed at this and said I was just playing favorites, to which I told him he was ridiculous and I just didn't want something his sister and I have a pre-established routine with to be disrupted.\n\nI said if he wanted to have his sandwiches on brioche, I could make loafs with him too.

But they both regularly ask for things, and I'm typically very accommodating for them both. He is 17, he could honestly be doing this all for himself but I get joy from caring for him while I still can. \n\nI thought I was in the right, but it's been days and he's still mad.
