My dad's only response is to yell \"Toby (my dog), NO\", multiple times. Meanwhile, my dog is just looking at the cat as she's trying to hit him and hissing at him.\n\n I get up from the couch completely pissed, grab my dog, and say we're not going to come over anymore if this keeps happening, because again, this is the umpteenth time he yells at my dog and not his cat, even when she hisses at him unprompted.

My mom, then does speak up to say, \"That's not what she's trying to say.\" I then get up from the couch, say I'm leaving, and he says nothing else.\n\nMy mom then follows me outside, clearly upset and I get into my car trying to keep my composure and not sob, just asking her to not let this ruin her day and result in them fighting. She just kept telling me she doesn't want me to drive in the condition I was in and I reassured her I would be fine. \n\nI then dropped my dog off at home to go grocery shopping (as I sobbed the whole way home, 10 minutes), to go grocery shopping. In the store, I received a text from my dad saying \"Thanks for making mom's day and keeping that in mind, have a good day.\" I don't respond to this and try not to lose my shit in the store. \n\nI told my husband all of this over text as he's at work, and he's livid and texted my dad saying, \"thanks for making (my name)'s day, have a good day.\n\nI am just absolutely BESIDE myself.

Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. You are only able to affect change on your side of things. You can't force your dad to change or take responsibility or admit when he's wrong or whatever it is you think he should be doing. You can only change yourself and how you handle things.

He also sucks for the text. \n\nC) You and your mom both suck for getting so fucking upset over a very small situation. You were so upset that she was worried about you driving.
