We have been dating for over a year. I also have a 11 year old daughter. My daughter has severe asthma which has been difficult to control. She has experienced multiple attacks with one that happened two years ago causing her to be placed on a ventilator for three days. Every single asthma attack she has had has landed her seriously ill in the hospital. My boyfriend knows all of this yet doesn\u2019t seem to care.\n\nUnfortunately he is someone who vapes. I wouldn\u2019t care if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I have a child with a medical condition that has almost taken her from me in the past. Just before he finally met my daughter I asked him to please don\u2019t vape around her because of her asthma, which he agreed to. It wasn\u2019t much of an issue at first because he wasn\u2019t around her often but now that we\u2019re basically living together (in MY house) it started to become a substantial issue for me. \n\nI asked him if he would consider quitting vaping, he said absolutely not. I feel like he is vaping more and more and he does it inside even when I\u2019ve told him over and over again to stop and to do it outside. I\u2019m genuinely concerned that it\u2019s going to trigger an asthma attack in my daughter one day. He literally started vaping when he was sat next to my daughter once. I had to tell him to get the fuck outside with that shit and he told me to \u201cchill.\u201d \n\nMy ex (my daughter\u2019s father) has also told my boyfriend he has to stop vaping around our daughter to no avail. \n\nWell this morning while he was asleep I got up and took his vape pens and threw them in the trash. When he woke up and noticed they were gone, he had the biggest fit. He started yelling at me. He called me an annoying twat, told me I had no right to touch his property and he is now telling me I have to pay him back. I asked him if he understands how serious my daughter\u2019s asthma is, he replied that I was acting like a helicopter mum and my daughter is never gonna survive in the world because the world is full of people who smoke. He then stormed out and hasn\u2019t been back all day. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679223969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vigu9/aita_for_throwing_out_my_boyfriends_vapes_without/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
