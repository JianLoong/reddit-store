I must note that my eldest sister (Abby) who I'm NC with is not in this thread.\n\nThe picture was of my 14 year old nephew and my 22 year old autistic brother in the back of a cop car. I though it was just a funny picture, but my niece said that it was legit and that we had to go bail them out.\n\nI got a forwarded audio of Abby saying that my nephew was let go because he's a minor, but my brother will be detained until we can pay bail and present some documents. I have no knowledge of the law and I can't think straight cause I saw my brother in the back of freaking cop car.\n\nI call my dad and he's not answering my calls and I have no idea what's going on. \n\nI go downstairs where I have to wake up my 60 year old mother, who is diabetic and has heart issues. (Her brother, my uncle, has also been on life support for the past two weeks) \n\nI'm on the verge of a massive panic attack because I can't help but think of what my autistic brother will go through while detained. \n\nI have no answers and my calls are going straight to voicemail. I check my mom's phone hoping I'll get some info, and I see that Abby has sent my mom the picture with the text \"They've been arrested\" \n\nSo now I'm really starting to break down. \nI wake up my mom and tell her what's happening. \n\nAnd my dad finally answers my call. \n\nI ask him what's going on and he says everything is fine, but I keep asking.

I break down in my room. \n\nMy mom rips Abby a new one over the phone and when the boys get home they try to talk to me, but I very sternly tell them I will talk to them tomorrow. \n\nThey try to explain that Abby though it'd be funny and by the time they noticed what she had done they just kinda went along when they saw what was happening. \n\n\nI don't know if I acted too harsh towards them and maybe I should've heard them out, considering it wasn't entirely their idea. \n\nThey're typically good boys.\n\nEdit: Abby told them to pose for the picture and she basically took it from there.", "created_utc": 1673938663, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10e5ktx/aita_for_telling_my_family_to_fck_off/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
