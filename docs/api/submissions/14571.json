They had dug into her eyeshadow palettes with her brushes and poured out her foundations into them and a bunch of her compacts were in the sink soaked in water. \n\nShe immediately freaked out, and I rushed to the room when I heard her yelling. When I saw what was happening I grabbed both of them and marched them into the living room. I told my brother what they did and that they needed to leave now and that I will speak with him later. He told me I was overreacting which I responded by telling him to GTFO out of my house. My parents didn\u2019t understand until they saw the giant mess the kids had made, and my sister said I was out of line but she understood. \n\nMy wife is absolutely devastated as she got really into makeup during the 2020 lockdown and even started posting to Instagram and has spent a lot of money on her collection. She\u2019s spent over 4k on it and the collection was her pride and joy. She went through what was destroyed and they ended up destroying 1.5k worth of makeup. \n\nMonday afternoon I messaged my brother and told him he needed to pay my wife back for what his kids destroyed and sent him the total. My wife even pulled up the cost of each item ruined and I sent that to him as well. He told me to fuck off and that he won\u2019t be paying that much, but he\u2019s willing to replace one of the palettes. I said that\u2019s not enough and that since his kids destroyed very important items he needs to replace them or pay the cost for it.

Do they have something personal against your wife because this is odd behavior", "NTA.\n\nThe kids are in their TEENS and destroying people's property as if they're toddlers. He needs to take a step back and look at how he's raising these kids. The way they're acting says a lot about his inability to parent.\n\nMakeup isn't cheap, and his lack of accountability speaks volumes. He needs to replace the products himself or buy your wife a gift card to Sephora for the full amount. \n\nBetter yet, he should make get his kids work summer jobs to pay back the cost of the makeup they destroyed.", "NTA. They were just being destructive. I thought these were going to be small kids, not teens. Make up is expensive!", "NTA, he spawned them, he's responsible for them.", "NTA. Yikes. Those kids are a little old to destroy their aunt\u2019s personal effects. That\u2019s just mean. Have they expressed any remorse or reason for doing so?\n\nHonestly I\u2019d say work with your brother on the money but get to the bottom of the issue because this ish is disturbing.", "Nta. \n\nHis kids are 12 and 14.

Horrible parenting.   \n\nI'm guessing that they are not even punished at all for their actions either.  \n\nDid they at least apologize?", "They\u2019re old enough to know better. NTA.", "NTA. If the kids came into your home and destroyed a $1500 painting they would be expected to pay for it, right? Makeup is expensive, and it\u2019s unfortunate that they are in this position, but it is what it is. You break it you bought it. You\u2019re not running a charity or a funhouse for their kids. This is a big learning experience for your bro and his kids; don\u2019t touch other peoples things without express permission.\n\nEdited to add: I breezed past the kids ages at first, thinking they were like 5 & 7\u2026 they are teens?? This is completely unacceptable behaviour. Wtf is wrong with them and your bro? Wow", "NTA his kids are old enough to know better", "NTA\nI feel like your brother is devaluing it because it's 'just' make-up. I suspect if they had smashed up a piece of furniture he wouldn't be pushing back so hard.", "NTA.   \nKids of that age knew EXACTLY what they were doing. They should have learnt to a) not touch other people\u2019s stuff, and b) not finger paint in someone else\u2019s make up and c) the financial COST of the products they were destroying.   \nINFO: Are the kids little shits in other ways too? \n\n  \nI\u2019m torn between asking for full replacement value, and asking for second hand / part used market value. Anything outright destroyed should be replaced. Anything still useable maybe should be a part replacement cost? An eye shadow dug into with brushes should still be useable in a lot of instances, if not all of the bottled products were poured out etc\u2026 but I don\u2019t know the scale of the disaster.", "NTA.  Kids that old should know better unless they have issues that make it difficult for them to learn expected standards of behavior.  Even if it was much younger kids, part of being a parent is accepting that you\u2019re morally and legally responsible for damage your kids cause.", "Hold up, 12 and 14 yr old kids did this? Yeah, this was malicious and they/their parents absolutely should pay.", "NTA - these kids were old enough to know better. Parents, you are responsible for paying for what your kid fucks up.", "NTA.  Nobody wants to be responsible for their own actions anymore.  His kids did the damage and he needs to pay for it, regardless of the cost.

But if their own father won\u2019t take responsibility, I doubt they\u2019ve been taught how to apologize.", "Absolutely NTA, they're not babies, they're teenagers. It wasn't a simple mistake like a toddler finger painting with them, they intentionally went out of their way to destroy it and they knew better. From you brother's and SIL's reaction, I'm willing to bet this isn't the first time they've done something crazy like this and gotten away with it. If he's going to let them run wild then he has to deal with the consequences.", "I\u2019m sorry, 12 and 14 years old? Absolutely NTA. Maybe, MAYBE it would be pushing into ah territory if they were 2 and 4\u2026 but that is more than old enough to know better. If they make messes like that at your house, what do they do at home???", "Truthfully if the make-up was infact $4k , I would take them to small claims court to make them pay up. There will be some drama and backlash but it seems necessary.", "NTA Your brothers inaction and reaction to his children's destruction is why a 12 (!) and 14 (!) year old destroyed something that was not theirs and in a place that they absolutely had no business being in, in the first place! \n\nI would seriously look at small claims court and go NC with your brother.", "Dad is responsible. Both kids are old enough to kids babysit to earn money to pay dad back. NTA", "He has 2 options.  Repay for the damages or hire a lawyer to handle it he juvenile felony  record charges you are pressing", "If they don't end up paying-- take the total and minus every birthday and holidays gifts that you usually give the kid + their parents. Until the total zeros out", "NTA\n\nI fully expected to read that the kids were little and might have had sympathy. But 12 and 14?! They're definitely old enough to know what they did was nasty and wrong. The fact that your brother doesn't want to take responsibility shows where the kids got it from.\n\nGiven the dollar amount, I'd consider getting the police involved. This is pretty blatant destruction of property.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe kids did that on purpose.", "ESH. Those two are way too old for pull that sort of crap. However, I wouldn\u2019t cause a rift in the family like that. If your brother volunteers to pay, all well and good, but this could damage your relationship with your brother and his wife. You have to ask yourself if this worth that. I also wouldn\u2019t have told my brother he needed to leave. I think the whole incident would have already lead your brother and his wife to insist that they and the kids to leave after they had destroyed the makeup without you needing to tell him to leave.

If I really wanted my brother to pay, I would handle it privately, perhaps set up a repayment plan and a long, careful conversation, but I wouldn\u2019t yell at him to leave. I feel the brother would probably do that on his own, or OP\u2019s sister  in law would out of shame and needing to reprimand his moronic children. Still, it all depends on what type of relationship they want to maintain in the coming years. Ultimately, I think the entire thing was handled poorly. Having known people who fly off the rails, this is really the best way to get the results you are looking for and maintain an amicable relationship. It is, of course anyone\u2019s prerogative to handle this how they wish to do with their own family.", "That would be the right reaction, but the brothers refuses it", "True. Then the brother sucks. Or he\u2019s in dire financial straits. Or both. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I do feel very bad for the wife, though. Makeup is extremely expensive."]}
