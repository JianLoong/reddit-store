Your brother and his kids are MAJOR AHs though!! If he refuses to pay, get into legal action. 1.5k worth of INTENDED, DELIBERATE damages by TEENAGERS and he REFUSES to pay? Nah, I\u2019d be suing and cutting contact over this. \n\nTell your wife I am so, so sorry. Someone willingly destroy something you love and your \u201conly\u201d way of doing your favorite hobby is so cruel, I hope she can rebuild her collection.", "NTA\nThe kids knew what they were doing", "NTA. Those kids knew what they were doing. If they'd been ages 3-5, it'd be a different situation. These sound like they did it intentionally. No way kids that age didn't realize what they were destroying", "NTA. Small claims is an option if they don\u2019t pay up", "Do the kids have medical issues or are just f\\*cking AH?  I can see preschoolers doing that but not a pre-teen and teen.  Tell him to pay or you will file a police report for vandalism.  They both are old enough to get juvenal records and should have them for doing this.", "They destroyed property. He pays or you call the police. If they were younger maybe but they\u2019re beyond old enough. NTA", "Yeah, the kids KNEW. They should have beem punished for this, forexample no gifts for upcoming year, and instead of gifts one item per gift was replaced one by one.\n\nTo pay 1.5K suddenly is a lot. Ofcourse it is not unreasonable, but somekind of arrangement should be done.\n\nAlso, WTF is wrong with these kids?? No rispect! If the make up was on display for them to see, they could ask. Like 12 girl could ask her to do some eyeshadow for her or something. Something is off here, either they have so little they become mean envy and destroy other people's belongings. Or they are spoiled with no boundaries. I wouldn't be surprised if these kids were bullies and/or in somekind of distress.", "NTA.   \n\nThe VAST MAJORITY of the makeup I *regularly* use can fit into a shoebox\u2014 a very expensive one\u2026 easily worth a grand.  And if I added brushes & skincare to it, and maybe a couple of palettes that I use for special occasions, it would still fit but would probably add $500?  That doesn\u2019t even include the other products that I don\u2019t wear or use regularly but invested in. \n\nI don\u2019t wear makeup as much as I used to but as I\u2019ve gotten older and my skin has aged, QUALITY COUNTS.   \n\nThose kids were way too old to not know better.  But I am suspecting that maybe your brother isn\u2019t reacting as much to *their actions* as he is to YOURS.   That you \u201cmarched them downstairs and told him what they did and *that they need to leave NOW*\u201d (paraphrased/condensed for convenience).    Were you wrong in doing so?  Nope.  But consider for a moment that the way that you responded (rightfully) didn\u2019t just call out his children\u2019s bad behavior but also\u2026 unintentionally called out his parenting skills.   It\u2019s very easy for some people to mask shame with righteous indignation and you might have stumbled into a situation that caused him to do just that; and he buckled down rather than acknowledge, apologize, or make amends.", "Yeah 12 and 14 is way too old to be doing something like that. When I saw the headline I was thinking 3-6 not 12-14! Yikes\u2026", "Exactly, this has to be malicious and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s an edit saying one of them was filming it for TikTok. \n\n\u201cHehe we destroyed my aunt\u2019s makeup as a prank. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have wasted so much money hehe/s\u201d", "Yeah. what\u2019s going on here.", "My thought too, only imagining if they'd keyed a car or similar.  NTA", "Exactly. If the kids are too young to understand or have issues that make it difficult for them to understand such things, then the responsibility rests fully with their parents. Either way, your brother needs to fork out for the damages his kids caused.\nNTA.", "Exactly what I was thinking.", "I was literally sitting here going please don't be a Mothership palette! Lol", "Yup I would definitely bring this up! They are his kids if he didn't teach them better he better start real quick and seeing that actions can have consequences should get him to wisen up. These kids are old enough to have chores and allowances if they do making them help pay as well should also teach them a lesson \nNTA", "If your brother won't bend, I'm with the others who have suggested small claims court. Check your jurisdiction, but damages over $1k may be a felony; if you point that out to your brother, it may \"encourage\" him to reconsider.", "Oh that's sad! Could be worse.... I was sure you were going to say it was a Pat McGrath Mothership palette! I would lose my mind if somebody destroyed one of mine! \n\nNTA but Just skip the formalities and go straight to filing in small claims court! Make sure you have pictures of everything and a list of witnesses that were there.\n\nNo matter what happens with this you will no longer have a relationship with your brother so you might as well get paid back in full!", "I worked at Ulta, and any prestige palette would be at least $30, most are $40+ now. prestige foundations are going for $40+, concealers for $30+.", "Take those texts as proof and take them to small claims court.", "If I were you I would never host them again. I wouldn\u2019t let them set foot in my house again \n\nAnd take your brother to small claims court. \nYou could also claim on your household insurance if you have one but then your premium will go up over the next years.", "One of them is literally a teenager. If they're behaving like this at this age then they are going to be NIGHTMARES that society will be expected to deal with.", "Flying off the rails? A teen and a preteen purposely damaged almost $2K worth of their aunt's property. We're not talking about an accident or an overreaction here on OP'S part.\n\nAlso you clearly missed the part where the yelling didn't start until OP's brother acted like it was no big deal\n\n>I told my brother what they did and that they needed to leave now and   \nthat I will speak with him later. He told me I was overreacting which I   \nresponded by telling him to GTFO out of my house. \n\nThe raised voice was acceptable at that point because if I tell you to leave nicely & that we'll talk about it later & you respond like that? Full force theater trained lung projection so the neighbors can hear.", "If you think so, you are certainly entitled to that opinion."]}
