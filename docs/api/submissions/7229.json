You are not excluding people, you are just not including them.

Not asking whether I should change my plans, asking if I'm the asshole for not telling people beforehand.", "You want to elope.  Your partner wants to elope.\n\nYet you're doing something you don't want to do because you'd rather be upset yourself than your mother be upset.", "Absolutely right, OP. NTA. And you aren't being dramatic, regardless of what this person implies", "I am not upset by having a small ceremony in my home with 6 attendees.  I would \\*rather\\* not have anyone there, and I would be upset by a big production, but this is a pleasant compromise for me.  Please stop projecting on me.", "If you're perfectly fine with it, and not upset at all, why are you here questioning if you're an asshole for only prioritizing your mother this much?  Why is your 'anxiety through the roof?'  Why do you feel 'selfish?'  \n\n>  Am I being selfish for not including more people in a ceremony that means very little to me and my partner?\n\nNo.  But you guys don't want this, so why are you doing it?  Why are you telling your fiance that your, and his, desires matter less than your mother's?  What other opinions of hers override yours and his?", "I'm fine with what we've decided on.  The pressure to do even more, which I am not comfortable with, has been causing me anxiety (which I already struggle with).  I don't feel selfish, I am asking the community if I am being selfish since none of us are good at judging when we are.  \nMy partner and I decided together to have a small ceremony.  I did not unilaterally make this decision and ignore his feelings - he's actually the one who suggested it as a compromise that we would both be comfortable with.    \n\n\nMy question back to you is why do you feel so strongly about telling me that I am wrong, instead of taking my word for it when I say that I'm fine?  Please just stop."]}
