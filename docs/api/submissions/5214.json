We have been discussing finalizing plans, and I\u2019ve started being concerned. The venue we\u2019ve chosen has a limit of 75 people, which was fine by us because we didn\u2019t want a huge wedding. The problem is, as we are making the guest list since we saved that for last, my fianc\u00e9 has invited literally every single person on the guest list without consulting me at all. \n\nRight now it consists of my family, his family, and TONS of his coworkers and friends. The only people that I know that will be at our wedding is my own immediate family. I barely know his closest friends and his family, and I\u2019ve never met most the people he\u2019s invited. I really wanted to invite my group of close friends, (5 girls) to our wedding because I wanted them to be my bridesmaids. Now, I will have only my mom, and I\u2019m pretty upset. Here\u2019s where I might\u2019ve been the asshole. I confronted my boyfriend about this, and he said I could just have his sisters and mom be my bridesmaids. I yelled at him and said I barely knew his sisters, and I\u2019m not going to have his mom as my bridesmaid because I wanted people I actually liked to be it. He got mad and yelled at me, saying she was going to be my mother in law soon enough and I needed to show her respect. I cried and ended up asking my mom about what to do. \n\nWe\u2019ve already booked the venue, and I\u2019ve asked him about changing to a bigger one but he refuses. I asked him why he was allowed to have random coworkers invited and I couldn\u2019t just have 5 of my closest friends at least. He told me that as a man he needs to prove to the other men that he is married and is \u201cwinning\u201d against them?? I was so confused, and also hurt. I feel like calling off the whole wedding, and my boyfriends family have been constantly texting me telling I\u2019m overreacting and that I should feel grateful since he\u2019s paying for most of it anyways since I have debt from college and couldn\u2019t.

I said I didn\u2019t like my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mother, and I argued with him rather rudely. 2. I basically insulted my fianc\u00e9s mother who had nothing to do with the situation really, and I have ruined my boyfriends good mood by arguing with him about the same thing so much.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am usually very tentative about suggesting people get out of relationships, but this just sounds so wrong.  When you are married you are partners, and that needs to start with the wedding planning.  The guest list should be/should have been a collaborative effort.  His reasoning for inviting so many random people sounds really freaking weird.

Why are you marrying this complete @rsehole?\n\nJust RUN!\n\nOh and NTA", "NTA. This is not love. This is the foundation of subservience. Take this as clear warning sign and leave this relationship.

You have no obligation to use all of his sisters and mom as bridesmaids, since it is your side of the aisle they are standing on.

No bride wants strangers or their mother in law to be their bridesmaids. I have no idea what his notion of becoming a married man equals winning has to do with, although I have a sneaking idea that it has something to do with you becoming his possession after marriage. And of course his family are insisting that you are over reacting, they know that there's very few women on this earth who will put up with him if you decide that you've had enough. So what if he's paying for most of it, does he want a medal? It's up to you, break it off now and lose deposits or marry him and spend years of your valuable time, money and effort being shackled to someone who sees you as not an equal. Why willingly do that to yourself? You deserve to be loved, respected and treated as an equal by your significant other.", "NTA.

NTA at all.\n\nIdeally, as much as possible the guest list really ought to be equally split. After necessary family are invited, then you divide the remaining invites and priorities who you each want to invite.  OR, like in the case of my own you divide it from the beginning. In my case I had a lot more family, so my in laws invited more family friends. The key here is communicating who you want to be there for you, and respecting each other's need to have their friends to celebrate with and support you.\n\nIt is deeply concerning that he doesn't think you need any of your friends.  And wtf is it that he has to show that he winning. Winning what? Arsehole of the year award?

We have been discussing plans, and I\u2019ve started being concerned. The venue we\u2019ve chosen has a limit of 75 people, which was fine by us because we didn\u2019t want a huge wedding. The problem is, as we are making the guest list, my fianc\u00e9 has invited literally every single person on the guest list without consulting me at all. Right now it consists of my family, his family, and TONS of his coworkers and friends. The only people that I know that will be at our wedding is my own immediate family. I barely know his closest friends and his family, and I\u2019ve never met most the people he\u2019s invited. I really wanted to invite my group of close friends, (5 girls) to our wedding because I wanted them to be my bridesmaids. Now, I will have only my mom, and I\u2019m pretty upset. Here\u2019s where I might\u2019ve been the asshole. I confronted my boyfriend about this, and he said I could just have his sisters and mom be my bridesmaids. I yelled at him and said I barely knew his sisters, and I\u2019m not going to have his mom as my bridesmaid because I wanted people I actually liked to be it. He got mad and yelled at me, saying she was going to be my mother in law soon enough and I needed to show her respect. I cried and ended up asking my mom about what to do. We\u2019ve already booked the venue, and I\u2019ve asked him about changing to a bigger one but he refuses. I asked him why he was allowed to have random coworkers invited and I couldn\u2019t just have 5 of my closest friends at least. He told me that as a man he needs to prove to the other men that he is married and is \u201cwinning\u201d against them?? I was so confused, and also hurt. I feel like calling off the whole wedding, and my boyfriends family have been constantly texting me telling I\u2019m overreacting and that I should feel grateful since he\u2019s paying for most of it anyways since I have debt from college and couldn\u2019t.

This man showed you his true colors. \n\n1. This is something you decide together, compromise together,  get married together. Not making room for your close friends while his coworkers can be there is absolute and utter bullshit. This is not a prolonged bachelor party for him and his friends.\n\n2. He \"fixed\" your problem with something that has nothing to do with what your issue was with. You want your friends there, they could be there if he wasn't being an absolute AH. You not wanting his mother as a bridesmaid has nothing to do with you liking/respecting or disliking her. He's denying your needs by emotionally manipulating you by feeling bad about something different. \n\n\n3. If his idea of masculinity is this fragile in a wedding, a celebration, it's not gonna get any better after you're married. If \"winning\" from a random coworker is more important to him in this wedding than your freaking happiness... you got all the answers you need. He does not care enough about you, sorry, but he clearly doesn't.\n\n\nMy biggest issue is that there's absolutely no room for you, and you somehow feel like you did something wrong. His behavior is abusive and very selfish. I also don't like throwing around the term narcissistic personality, but he has shown absolutely no regard for your needs and wants. And when you share them he doesn't listen at all. Like aaaaat aaaaaaall! He only tricks you into believing something must be wrong with you for wanting to have a very small say in something that you absolutely deserve a say in. I'm very scared for you OP. He isn't a good man. He likes his idea of you, but I highly doubt he loves you for you", "NTA run now. He\u2019s showing you who he is, believe him. This sounds like the beginning of isolation and keeping you on leash.", "NTA. Don\u2019t marry him. He is controlling and manipulative as is his family.

He expects you to exclude your friends and family so he can have more people.

Trust your instincts.", "YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED: GET OUT! This is not a test, this is a clear message he is sending you. If you get married your life, self esteem, financial freedom is over.

But run, call it off. When your gut tells you something, listen to that bitch.", "[removed]", "NTA. Get out now. \n\nIt'll be a lot harder further down the line when he's done alienating you from your support systems/you've had kids/he's controlling *all* the finances.\n\nYou deserve an equal partner that values you and cares about your wants and needs.", "NTA. Like a bunch of people have pointed out alredy, he's isolating you from your friends/family!! My mom used to be married to a prick like that. She wasn't alowed to talk to ANY of her male friends!

You are being warned about his character and how little he values your feeling.  DO NOT MARRY SOMEONE WHO DISREGARDS YOUR FEELINGS AND SHOWS YOU NO RESECT.  He will take you more and more for granted AFTER you are married because it it more difficult and expensive to divorce than to break up an engagement .

Very heavily implies that he doesn't involve her in his life at all, by his choice.", "Read that too and thought exactly the same thing. He needs therapy, I hope she gets some therapy for his abusive behavior as well. But no couples therapy, this guy doesn't deserve to be in a couple\n\nLuckily all reactions but that one tell her to run is some way or another :)", "Yea exactly, especially if a relationship was good before but got a little rocky along the way. Normally I would say speaking to each other about it is the answer, talk it through. But he just sounds like the biggest asshole ever and I'm afraid he will only manipulate her more. He clearly doesn't care about her needs and only thinks of himself, there's no winning here", "Also, there are about a dozen red flags for abuse. If the guy is an abuser  couples therapy won\u2019t work he\u2019ll charm the therapist and make OP think he\u2019s right."]}
