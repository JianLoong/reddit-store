It is not only common to have to replace an exhaust fan motor - it\u2019s long-term routine upkeep to expect to need done on the cheapest builder model fans.  And because of that, they\u2019re basically MADE so that the fan motor can be replaced almost as easy as you\u2019d change a light bulb.  (The majority actually just plug into the exhaust fan housing it fits up into.)  \n\nIf you remove the vent cover that\u2019s covering your exhaust fan, you will probably see that the actual fan motor (think moving part) is plugged into a regular looking outlet on the actual exhaust fan housing (think non-moving part that\u2019s actually attached to the boards in your ceiling to secure it & has a port with the exhaust duct in the ceiling connected to it to carry the exhaust outside).  \n\nIt is easy peasy to unplug & remove the fan & just as easy to replace it & plug it back in.  (I\u2019m talking less than 5 minutes each & that includes finding a chair or stool to stand on.)  \n\nThe make & model # should be printed on the exhaust housing - usually right next to the motor.  You can use that to buy a replacement for the fan part you\u2019ll be removing & replacing.  \n\nIf it\u2019s a basic builder model exhaust fan, it\u2019s probably a standard 50 CFM fan (the smallest lowest CFM exhaust fan that\u2019s ever been made to my knowledge).

There's more than one person in the world who does this??", "I think about me reusing a paper towel cause \"there's nothing *gross* on it\" and then there's these people :/", "What does your dead husband have to do with this?", "Yeah, I grew up in Colorado and this story made me physically cringe.", "And gas is free?", "OP\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t even enter the shower. It\u2019s not the same.", "The husband isn\u2019t even in the bathroom when he does this. He\u2019ll even be working while he does it. It\u2019s not about downtime.", "Oh shower after work?????", "Why do you need an excuse? If he's not in the room, turn off the water.\n\nAnd get your exhaust fan fixed. Why the hell is *that* an ongoing issue?\n\nYour house is going to be condemned at this rate when you're neglecting the most basic maintenance while actively causing massive damage.", "Install a faucet that turns off automatically after a few minutes.", "Weird. I do basically everything your husband does except I sit in the steam, for like 20 minutes then I\u2019ll shower. I enjoy the white noise and peaceful alone poop time lol", "What a TA..  why are you tolerating this?", "Still no consideration for others. Too busy soothing his own ego to solve this issue", "Or, and I know this sounds crazy but hear me out, he can turn off his own water like a fucking functional adult.", "That's really his takeaway from this whole thing? That it's okay for *you* to turn off the water that _he_ wastefully turns on for absolutely no reason? Girl he's a whole yard over the line and he's bending back about an inch.", "Pathetic man", "Your husband sounds like a child", "I live in Australia and this story has broken me, I don't understand being so careless with such a precious resource.", "Seriously he is enraging.. thoughtless.. ah.", "Also, Is he at risk of getting a call 24/7, because wtf?", "If he stopped this insanity, OPs electricity bill would be very much lower, and he wouldn't have to work so hard.\n\nI mean electric showers can use 10kWh in that time. How much do you pay for electricity?", "Living in a health and safety hazard", "Some crude hyperbole to nail the point home to the dead horse. \n\n\u201cMy bf won\u2019t flush and gets mad when I point it out, AITA?\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cThanks everyone I showed him the comments and he says I can do it.\u201d", "Wait till he's in then flick the electric off to the heater.", "Running the shower for 30 minutes, but does he lock himself in the bathroom? That might suggest he's masking the sounds of something he doesn't want her to hear.", "It\u2019s not but my point is that it\u2019s relaxing and decompressor for some. I\u2019ve heard men do this but this guy is just weird. He lets it run for a long ass time before getting in.", "Grow up. Everyone poops.. or get a bathroom fan", "I'm in a short-term rental now and I was feeling guilty for taking 2 showers short in one day after exercising.  Wow.  OP is NTA and her husband certainly is.  The idea that you are \"not paying for more water use\" is extraordinarily selfish and TA.", "Did she not think about the fact that your landlord might have started charging you for utilities because of that? I'm surprised they didn't freak from the high bills. I imagine that caused a high water bill. I had a roommate like that as well. I don't understand these people but whatever.", "Get a space heater then..", "It\u2019s really sickening. Water is so precious.", "Phones are also white noise machines!", "I know. It\u2019s disgusting waste.", "\"He's so sweet except for this one thing! And the way he talks to me, and treats me....\"", "Yes.. agreed.  Esh", "Wait why E S H?", "Or, and I know this may sound even crazier, he can leave the water off until he actually needs to take a shower.", "OR ... and hear me out ... not turn it on in the first place until he's ready for a shower.", "Yeah, this shouldn\u2019t even be an issue in the first place.", "I live in northern Colorado and couldn\u2019t imagine wasting that much water!!! I take three minute showers every other day to conserve. We do dishes in a wash pot in the sink and pour that water on our compost. We collect rain water to water our vegetable garden\u2026 all to be left useless because this jabroni turns the shower on for an hour before getting in. Granted most water here used is ag, but still, that\u2019s fucked.", "Because she's enabling.", "this is the way.  literally the only way.  I love my husband too, he is everything to me too lol, but this would still be a much bigger fight in my house than it seems op is willing to entertain", "That part but here we are. I dealt with a roommate that was like this. She was difficult not only in this area but other areas to the point that I had to move out. Her weird behavior was causing me mental health issues.", "Right, like what does \u201cI need to be able to jump in the shower at a moments notice\u201d even fucking mean? And what, he\u2019s tipped off that said moment will be within this 30-60 min window *maybe* ? Why can\u2019t he just shower and then when *the momentum\u2019s notice* finally arrives, he\u2019s already done lmao", "This is how I deal with these kinds of people anymore. I just refuse to entertain their shenanigans and I don't engage with them. You have to treat them like a toddler, ignore them and it doesn't encourage the behavior. Some people are difficult for the sake of getting attention. Some people will do anything to get any sort of attention they can. To them, it doesn't matter whether it's positive or negative attention, they just wanted attention. I don't entertain it.", "stop enabling him..and stop making excuses.", "So, like a responsible adult determined to make it work, he's discussed this with his doctor in the event that a simple change of brand or dosage would be life changing??\n\nAlso ADHD isn't allergies that flare. It's a prefrontal cortex issue. Sincerely, a person who works incredibly hard to manage their ADHD so I don't ruin anyone's life"]}
