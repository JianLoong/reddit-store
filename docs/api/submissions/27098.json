The movie was rated R and with it being a Sunday night, we didn't think there would be a ton of people there. \n\nWhen we got to our seats, there was only one other couple in there, and soon after, quite a few other people had shown up. There were two teen girls that sat in front of us, 4 teen boys that were seated two rows ahead, a couple other groups of people, and a few couples. Before the movie started, everyone was being really loud. The girls in front of us were on their phones, talking and laughing. The 4 boys were being obnoxious, making choking noises and such, then laughing like it was funny. The group to our right was talking loudly also. I ignored it all because the movie hadn't started yet. \n\nOnce the movie started, the girls in front of us, continued to be on their phones, talking and laughing. I said \"Excuse me. We're trying to watch the movie.\" Then the boys two rows ahead, were still being loud, making noises and laughing. I yelled out, \"Shut the fuck up! If you don't want to watch the movie, leave! Nobody thinks you're funny!\" \n\nAfter they initially laughed about me calling them out, it quieted down a little bit. It wasn't long before they were talking again. The girls in front of us resumed being on their phones, talking and laughing. I leaned forward and said to them, \"why did you come to a movie if you don't want to watch it? You're on your phone and talking this whole time.\" One of the girls told me she wasn't. I told her, \"yes, you are. I can see you. If you don't want to watch the movie, get the fuck out.\" I went back to trying to watch the movie. \n\nWith everyone talking and being disruptive, we decided to leave. Right before we got up to leave, I think I heard the girl in front of us crying. I didn't mean to make anyone cry, but come on. Going to the movies isn't fun anymore. No one can shut up and stay off their phones for an hour or two.
