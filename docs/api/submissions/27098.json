The movie was rated R and with it being a Sunday night, we didn't think there would be a ton of people there. \n\nWhen we got to our seats, there was only one other couple in there, and soon after, quite a few other people had shown up. There were two teen girls that sat in front of us, 4 teen boys that were seated two rows ahead, a couple other groups of people, and a few couples. Before the movie started, everyone was being really loud. The girls in front of us were on their phones, talking and laughing. The 4 boys were being obnoxious, making choking noises and such, then laughing like it was funny. The group to our right was talking loudly also. I ignored it all because the movie hadn't started yet. \n\nOnce the movie started, the girls in front of us, continued to be on their phones, talking and laughing. I said \"Excuse me. We're trying to watch the movie.\" Then the boys two rows ahead, were still being loud, making noises and laughing. I yelled out, \"Shut the fuck up! If you don't want to watch the movie, leave! Nobody thinks you're funny!\" \n\nAfter they initially laughed about me calling them out, it quieted down a little bit. It wasn't long before they were talking again. The girls in front of us resumed being on their phones, talking and laughing. I leaned forward and said to them, \"why did you come to a movie if you don't want to watch it? You're on your phone and talking this whole time.\" One of the girls told me she wasn't. I told her, \"yes, you are. I can see you. If you don't want to watch the movie, get the fuck out.\" I went back to trying to watch the movie. \n\nWith everyone talking and being disruptive, we decided to leave. Right before we got up to leave, I think I heard the girl in front of us crying. I didn't mean to make anyone cry, but come on. Going to the movies isn't fun anymore. No one can shut up and stay off their phones for an hour or two. So, AITA for making this girl cry?", "created_utc": 1695002963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lizk2/aita_for_making_a_teenager_cry/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It might make me an asshole for being an adult yelling at minors. I guess I shouldn't have used profanity, but they were in a rated R movie. If they can't handle the f word, they shouldn't be in there. I would probably be upset if an adult made my child cry, but then again, I've taught my kids not to be disrespectful like that.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would\u2019ve definitely gotten the theater management to kick them out instead though. \n\nBeing on their phones / if you saw them doing any sort of camera / filming, they\u2019d get immediately removed.", "You only think you heard her cry. Even if she was crying, which I doubt, I am one hundred percent certain you didn\u2019t make her cry. She and her friends didn\u2019t give a crap about you or anyone else in the theater. NTA for saying something to them tho.", "Nta there's literally signs everywhere in our theater saying no phones during movies. And don't 99% of movies take a moment to put a giant sign on the screen that says \"please put your phones on silent and away for the movie\". I would have been pissed and if management didn't do anything when the previous couple left and asked then I would have asked for a refund and come back at a different time to try and enjoy the movie. I bet management would have done something when refunds start being requested.", "would have said E-S-H, but after reading one of your replies to another comment, i\u2019m going NTA. management should have done something the first time around", "NTA, zoomers are ruining every aspect of everybody else's lives. Their parents need to do a better job at raising them.", "NTA\nMaybe more people would practice better etiquette if they knew someone may call them out for their shitty behavior.  She should have been more considerate to those around her.", "NTA, it's me and my husband's biggest pet peeve. We always seem to sit right next to the talkers in the theater and the AH who can't go two seconds without checking their phones. PSA, if you can't watch a movie without talking or checking your phone 100 times, then stop going to the movies and wait for it to stream. We always try and be polite at 1st, but we've definitely made some comments to people. You go to the theater to escape the real world for a while. Not to hear other people talking or lights flashing on and off from phones.", "NTA, parents don't teach their kids correct behavior anymore... so strangers have to do it at times. Great Job on speaking up.", "ESH. They didn't have to be rude and you, as an adult, should be better at moderating your emotional response. Part of why they didn't listen to you was probably because it seems you swore out at them from the jump and that is never going to illicit a respectable response imho. edit- typo and added a sentence", "NTAH Absolutely justified.  Teen should have been more mindful of those around her.", "NTA. Teenagers are worse than little kids, they know they are being annoying and dont care to respect the rules of the fucking theater.", "Nah, NTA. Teenagers are dumb, I should know. I was a teenager too.", "Nta", "ESH.  Would you talk this way to an adult too? Just go tell management and let them handle it.", "Are you kidding? Even if you had pulled out a broadsword and wreaked bloody vengeance upon them all, you'd still be NTA. I went to a movie once with a friend who couldn't stay off her phone, and I told her to put the damn thing away. That was the last time we went to a movie together.", "Light YTA because swearing and yelling at teenage girls can be a fucking terrifying experience for them. They were being inconsiderate jerks, but you still shouldn't have done stuff that likely made them afraid. It would have made more sense to just... get movie theatre staff to deal with it.", "ESH\n\nThey suck for being loud during the movie.\n\nOP sucks for yelling out at them and cussing at them instead of getting an employee.", "NTA, what's the point of going to the cinema if you are going to be on the phone disturbing other who wants to watch the movie. you did the right by telling her to fuck off if she don't want to watch the movie and be on her phone. I am pretty sure you are not allowed on the phone if you are in the cinema. I would have reported them and demand for a refund.", "mild YTA. you could have explained to them that the screen made it hard for you to watch the movie and ask them to show a little consideration. instead you tried to dictate what this person was doing on their time and dime.\n\nto be clear: it is their business whether or not they are focusing on the movie, provided that it doesn't bother anyone rlse", "NTA but you should have called some employee", "NTA", "YTA\n\nThe correct ADULT response would be to fetch a member of staff not to yell at TEENAGERS!", "NTA for being upset they were goofing off and ruining the experience for everyone else, but to start cursing at kids telling them to \"get the fuck out\" yeah YTA", "YTA. Yes, the teenagers were annoying, but you don\u2019t yell and curse out children, Get Management and let them take care of it.", "YTA. Somebody\u2019s got anger issues\u2026", "YTA.  You're an adult, they're not; your pre-frontal cortex is fully developed, theirs isn't.  Their behavior was inconsiderate, but so was yours; two wrongs don't make a right.\n\nWhen visiting a public venue (eg. a movie theater) you have to accept that other people will be there, and it may affect your experience.  If a person/group is being disruptive, it's okay to ask them (politely) to stop.  As another poster suggested, it's even okay to involve management if they don't.  It's not okay to pick fights with/ scream obscienties at... kids.  You're here, asking if YTA for screaming obscenites at kids?

Teens should know basic etiquette.", "It's not that parents don't teach it, I've had 70 year olds talking and on phones near me in the theater. It's that people have forgotten how to act in public and have no regard for others at all.", "Weird, I remember this being the norm in other generations.", "I talked like that to the adults who go to movies and can't adhere to the no phones and talking rules. Movies are expensive, we should be able to watch them without assholes ruining the experience. NTA", "Yes, I would. They knew they were wrong. A couple before us told management and left. Management never even came in. Other people were shushing them as well. They weren't stopping and thought it was funny.", "Agree. Yelling at minors is just creepy for them.", "apparently op said in another reply that someone had already told an employee and they did nothing", "Being teenagers doesn't justify that behavior. Even a 12 year old would be more behaved than that. It's literally just etiquette and common sense.", "If they are considered kids, why are they at a rated R movie? If they're considered kids, they should have a chaperone with them, making sure they aren't behaving like assholes or they shouldn't be there at all.", "They're not \"kids.\" Kids aren't supposed to know basic etiquette. Teenagers are, and they should know the consequences after ignoring OP.", "If they can't handle the f word, maybe they shouldn't be at a rated R film?", "Also, the one couple that was in there when we got there, got up and told management and then left.

Did you even read my post?", "Agreed.  Raise the bar and set a good example of proper behavior.", "We did, but it's sad and pisses me off that we were the ones that had to leave. We had to leave because teens at an R movie can't stay off their phone and shut up AT A MOVIE THEATER?

I almost considered leaving because that type of behavior kills me. \n\nOne of the dudes from a couple legit yelled, \u201cYO, SHUT THE F-CK UP, FOR REAL!!!\u201d\n\nKids seemed *shocked* someone told them what to do. I thought a fight was imminent. They ended up whispering amongst themselves for a couple minutes before leaving to probably bother some other screening. \n\nI loved that dude.", "Teenagers are by nature, obnoxious creatures. You shouldn\u2019t have had to leave. Their behavior wasn\u2019t ok by any means, but neither was yours.", "This is a such a bullshit take.  Teens should know not to be dicks in public and are responsible for their own behavior.", "Yep", "So are adults. Case in point... perhaps we all need to better consider what we say, before saying it.\n\nHugs", "but they dont. thats the point and the main difference between adults and teenagers"]}
