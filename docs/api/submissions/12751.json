It was pretty obvious to me :)", "There are a couple ways to sort it out, and being a (hopefully not too \"know-it-all\") geek myself I had to go through it.\n\nSimplest mathematical way in my mind was to figure out how long it takes the cars to meet, then to multiply that amount of time by the super-bee's speed.\n\nThe time is pretty easy: 100 miles = (time) x (60 mph + 40 mph), or simplified, 100 miles = (time) x (100 mph), so time = 1 hour. \n\nOnce you have that, you know the bee travels 100 mph for one hour, so it went....100 miles. \n\nIt's fun but way too easy to overthink - that's probably why I love this sort of stuff so much. Your nephew's brilliance was in not making it a complicated problem when it didn't need to be.\n\nOf course, in that spirit, you didn't actually say the cars were heading towards each other to start out....if they were already past each other and going opposite directions..."]}
