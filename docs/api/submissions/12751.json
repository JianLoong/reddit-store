Not being able to figure things out makes you feel dumb. A friend of mine and I used to be teacher assistants at the same middle school and we were working in a math class together during a review. The two of us could NOT get this one word problem. Just .... We felt like idiots. Until the math teacher came over to look at our work and burst out laughing. He looked down at us and said \"stop trying to do 8th grade math in 6th grade. You're way overthinking this\" and just like THAT, the lightbulb went on and the three of us not only shared a really good laugh, but gave the kids a great example of how adults still have issues with things. As soon as you broke it down and explained he was over doing the math, it should have clicked. I'm sorry he's being a salty jerk when this could have been an amusing anecdote.", "NTA and this is a very old riddle. \n\nThere is anecdote about John Von Neumann that when he was asked a version of this riddle, he answered immediately and the questioner commented that he must have heard the trick before.

Mr. Know it all couldn't handle being shown up by his own son to the point of saying there was no way his son could do the math. Man was being an a$$ to both his son and his BIL. A person can be book smart while being common sense stupid. And riddles are usually more a case of listening and following common sense than doing math.  Must be hard living with that ego. My father had a 5th grade education, and you never wanted to listen to the convoluted path he took to do math, but he got the answer correct every friggin' time. All due to common sense. A college education does not always mean someone is smart. We've all known an educated idiot or ten in our lifetimes.", "Geez, someone's used to being the specialest most wonderful boy in the world. NTA, op.", "NTA. He embarrassed himself by stomping over to you to berate you for telling riddle he couldn't figure out.

Instead if being proud of his son for being smart enough to figure it out on his own, he had to think that somehow the two of you cheated.

People like that cannot stand to be corrected, especially in front of others, but you did it in a decidedly non-AH way.\n\nI'm wondering if you are perhaps a woman? Could be my own experience, but as a woman in an extremely male dominated field, I've encountered plenty of these dudes and it adds insult to injury if the person showing them up is \"gasp\" a female!\n\nIt was a bit of an AH move not to give us the riddle in the original post :)", "NTA- your sister is used to stroking his ego.

The bee will fly less than 100 miles. Because the car it is travelling toward is also moving during that hour. So if both cars were stationery the bee would travel 100 miles. But the car it is flying towards is moving towards it. So the answer is dependent on which car the bee is flying towards.", "~~1h, but the car moving south is obviously moving too so the distance is decreasing. So when the bee meets the car going south, it's not going to be the same as when the car going north meets the car going south. the question was about the distance and not the time right? if it's just the time then it'd just be about the cars and not about the bee at all~~  Right, it's just 100mph for an hour, mb lmao", "Happy cake day", "Wait. It would take the bee one hour to fly to the next car IF one car was stationary. But they are driving toward each other. So, wouldn't the bee fly 50 miles in 30 minutes?", "The actual math (if you don't do the fast logic way) is probably gonna end up looking kinda like calc", "No, that's irrelevant.", "It might seem that way but because it takes 1 hour for the cars to meet the bee gets to fly for 1 hour.

If the cars aren't magical then where on the Earth are they that they can circumnavigate the globe?", "No. It would take them an hour to meet, and in 1 hour the bee would fly 100mi because he is flying 100mph.", "The bee keeps flying for the whole time it takes the cars to meet, which is one hour.", "What color was the bus drivers hair?", "If you want to make it worse you post the answer in the OP, instead of the riddle.", "Yeah, *after* he gave us the answer.", "It takes just under 43 minutes for the bee to meet the car going 40 mph.  The bee is able to make one more complete flight back to the car going 60 mph before the cars meet.", "But the car going 40km/hr is also moving towards the bee simultaneously, so the distance would shorten from 100mph so wouldn\u2019t it be less that 100mph? The other car isn\u2019t stationary so it wouldn\u2019t have taken an hour to get to the other car as its coming closer as well.", "Oh certainly, that\u2019s the fun of a riddle! \n\nI was just approaching it from a math standpoint, where I guess these assumptions are common bcs my brain is wired for it", "That's what messed me up at first, I pictured one car travelling north, and the other traveling south away from each other.", "Oh yeah ofc! \n\nI\u2019m much better with math than riddles so that\u2019s actually what my brain automatically did. I can never figure out the easy solution haha", "It doesn't really matter where the bee flies, it matters how long it is flying for. The bee could be flying West and never meet the cars. The bee zigzagging isn't the point, it's a distraction. It's about how long the bee flies for in the amount of time that it takes for the cars to meet each other. It takes an hour. The bee is flying 100 miles per hour. Therefore, no matter what direction the bee is flying, it flew 100 miles in 1 hour.\n\nWe know it took an hour for the cars to meet because we know they were exactly 100 miles away from each other at the starting point, and their combined mph of travel is 100. One is going 60mph and the other 40, so 60+40=100.", "Remember the bee is going back and forth! So it\u2019s covering more distance than what is actually apparent. It\u2019s also not traveling with each car specifically. If we try to add up each individual distance it would be near impossible bcs there is an infinite number of decimals because everything is in constant motion. \n\nI hope that answered your question and didn\u2019t confuse you more \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019m not sure if I interpreted your question correctly", "Technically, with the Earth being a globe, they also would meet the other way round, but it would take much longer.
