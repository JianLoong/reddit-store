The kid can\u2019t quite manage it, and his mum comes over. She tells him \u2018that\u2019s the baby\u2019s toy\u2019 and he promptly ignores her.  I figure kids are kids & maybe he\u2019s a bit delayed or something (given that he wants a baby toy) & just smile at the mum who continues to crouch down beside him.\n\nSuddenly the kid leaps forward & jams both of his thumbs into my baby\u2019s eyes (think the mountain & pedro pascal in GOT).  I look immediately grab the kids arms & pull him back.  His mum does nothing & then tells me there was no need to do that\u2026. I am gobsmacked & she leaves with no apology.  My baby is now screaming so I take him out to settle him & make sure he\u2019s not injured.\n\nA few minutes later the mum comes over tells the kid to apologise to my baby & tells me I should apologise to her child for grabbing him.  \n\nAITA for just walking away?

I think a lot of people with their baby threatened probably would have hit as a first instinct.", "NTA.\n\nGoddamn I hate parents like this.\n\nThese are the people who's kids grow up psychos.", "NTA, you were just protecting your child, so the reaction is totally justified. That child could have seriously damaged your baby, so you shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for reacting the way you did. I think some people would have reacted even worse if some other kid did this to their child.", "NTA. I would have went all hell fire on that woman. She should have stopped her kid the second he touched the babies toys. She thinks her kid should be entitled to an apology? She\u2019s just crazy. She\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t poke her eyes.", "NTA. You kept calmer then i would have. She should have apologized to you for not keeping her kid in line.", "NTA.\n\nBut you should have confronted the other mum.", "NTA.,.the nerve of the mother to tell you need to apologize to her kid when her kid could\u2019ve injured your baby.  She should apologize for her being unable to control her child  You we\u2019re protecting your baby and did nothing wrong in my opinion.  We\u2019re you supposed to just sit there and smile politely as her child did whatever he wanted?", "Oh hell no. NTA. Your child was in immediate danger. You are more than justified.", "NTA. You removed a child who was hurting your child. You didn't hurt him, and his mother had the full opportunity to step in, and opted not to.", "NTA. You did the right thing to protect your kid, I\u2019d have probably drop kicked that other kid and the mum too!", "NTA obviously! Thats sounds terrifying", "NTA you were preventing potential lifelong eye issues for your baby. You did what had to be done.", "NTA.\n\nIf you can't control or teach your child to not do harm to others, somebody WILL do that for you. Also, you did absolutely nothing over the top, you grabbed the child and pulled it away from yours. WTF did that woman expect you to do? This is by defintion the singular most adequate reaction to this F'd up situation. Others (including me) would probably have handled this much worse. Some people really need all those slaps they never got when they were children. With interest.", "NTA - You were protecting your child. \n\nI had this exact thing happen to my child. I immediately grabbed the other child trying to gouge my childs eyes out and pulled them off. It was an instant reaction. \n\nThe mother of the other child apologised and put them in time out as punishment as well as explaining to her child why what they did was unacceptable. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, you reacted to protect your child. That's what parents do. What did the mum expect you to do? Let her child gouge your childs eyes out?", "NTA. You are allowed to protect your baby and 3/4 years old is too young to correct in any other way than just grabbing them (in the situation you were in). You'd do the same if the kid ran to the street or was about to play with a large unfamiliar dog. That's the village raising the child.", "NTA - That child hurt your baby and you were doing what any mother would. Were you just supposed to stand there and let the child hurt yours? You did the right thing by walking away because I'm sure most would've cussed out that woman!", "NTA\n\nYikes on bikes! Young kids are still learning to control their own strength. They don't typically have a comprehensive understanding of how much force it takes to cross the line between boo-boo and irreparable harm. Clearly this little dude isn't going to grasp the concept anytime soon. The other mom isn't teaching her kid the gravity of his actions. His action warranted a very clear behavioral correction. You instinctively protected your child. An apology from you puts his action on par with yours in his toddler brain and assault for funsies is absolutely different from rational acts of defense. Kiddo is not likely going to learn the difference if his mom keeps this sort of thing up.", "NTA: You never be AH for defending your baby from being physically hurt. \nThat mother owes you an apology for her child being out of control as that isn\u2019t normal behaviour to harm a baby.", "NTA and she should consider herself lucky her little demon didn't actually injure your baby or she could have been looking at some charges (if you're in America)", "NTA. At all.", "NTA. I would have handled that situation much worse and some strong language would have been used. Fuck that kid and his shitty mom.", "NTA\n\nAs the father of a Baby I can fully understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would even have told the mother, \"I'll apologise after I can stick my thumbs in your eyes, like he did to my baby, almost blinding her. Otherwise, F\\*ck off!\"", "NTA. You put your kids safety first. You didn't smack this other child you grabbed him so he couldn't hurt your child.", "NTA", "NTA, what Kind of an Angel are you?
