{"id": 33088, "submission_id": "18jbjgm", "title": "AITA for requesting distance from my adult daughter after a very disrespectful lie she told in our home?", "selftext": "My adult daughter (35) lives across the country but comes for visits of 1-2 weeks each December and during the summer to visit with family. These are our times to catch up and spend time together. \n\nShe does not plan for marriage or children, but she has a boyfriend she has lived with for a few years and we all know accidents can happen. She also tends to be a heavy drinker during her visits, kind of a wild child. We are a drinking family but her siblings have all cut back since having kids and we have cut back as we got older ourselves, so she always drinks more than us now. \n\nShe arrived yesterday to visit until Christmas. Her siblings and nieces/nephews all showed up to greet her, and my wife was pouring wine to sit down for a chat. My daughter turned it down, which was surprising. As the night continued she turned down drink after drink and we were surprised every time. She wouldn't give us a reason, so my wife thought to ask if she was pregnant. A reasonable explanation for the sudden change, when we have no other information.\n\nShe denied and denied but something felt strange. Eventually my wife put a glass of wine for her on the table and said, if you aren't pregnant, have this drink. My daughter was in an angry mood but picked up the glass, and said - okay, you got me, I am pregnant, let's give this kid some FAS - and literally downed the glass in two gulps\n\nThe entire room was horrified and we all erupted. She smugly waited almost five minutes before admitting she wasn't pregnant, then said she was feeling angry and wanted to upset us for a moment\n\nThis seems unacceptable. She had us thinking she was harming a child as a \"joke\" -- not funny.  Not even as a joke. Especially when we have so many other kids around for the holidays (our grandkids from other children)\n\nWe (her mother and I) have now requested if she will spend a few days with one of her brothers for a few days because we feel disgusted by her \"prank\" on us and find it hard to feel calm when seeing her\n\nWe are NOT asking her to leave town, or uninviting her from Christmas. We just need a few days to cool down. She agreed to go to one of her brothers' homes but has made it clear she thinks we are in the wrong. She wants an apology, but so do me and her mother from her.\n\nI think this is a small fight that will blow over even without apologies, if we just wait it out.\n\nAITA\n\nEdit because I can't keep up quickly with comments: Nobody cares if she doesn't drink, we just want to know the reason and don't like how secretive she is when asked direct questions. And she was a heavy drinker before, but she wasn't ever an alcoholic as far as I know. It seems strange for someone not drink at all at family occasions like this unless you need to be completely sober. In this family we believe that it's typical to have 1-3 drinks on vacation days, and it does seem suspicious to abstain completely unless you're an alcoholic. And if she is one, I think we should know that as a family to support it so we would need to have a conversation about it. It's more complicated than you may think ", "created_utc": 1702677743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jbjgm/aita_for_requesting_distance_from_my_adult/", "score": 571, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is it with people pressuring other people to drink? Why can't they accept a \"no\"? Even if it is out of character?\n\nSecond - if she was pregnant, you tried to force her to tell you something that she didn't want to tell you. Family or not, she is not obligated to tell you anything about her life, even if she is pregnant. And, she may have an of a hundred reasons not to drink, including simply trying to make changes to her life, but you were absolutely convinced that there was only one answer to the situation. \n\nFace the truth - she made the joke to shut you up because you would not stop harassing her even when she repeatedly asked you to stop. The unacceptable behavior started with you. And, if she is pregnant, seeing how you treated her, I can see why she would not want to tell you and why she visits only once a year.\n\nConsidering whose bad behavior started this, your daughter is right - you owe her the apology. You saying she owes you one is simply you knowing you are in the wrong and not wanting to admit it to anyone. It's a version of \"it's not what you said, but how you said it.\"", "So you pressured and pressured her to drink after hearing \"No.\" several times. You accused her of being pregnat  then got pissy and excuded her from family holiday when she turned your bullshit around on you?\n\nYTA\n\nEta: you don't \"need a few days to cool down\" you need to fucking apologize because this entire shit storm is your fault. Spelling is herd", ">  if you aren't pregnant, have this drink.\n\nWhat sort of blackmailing is this? YTA.", "YTA.  People have many different reasons for not drinking.  The wine ultimatum was an asshole move and an attempt to out her.  What if she had been pregnant and wasn't ready to share the news?  What if she was pregnant and lives in a state where she can't get abortive services?  What if she was pregnant and the fetus wasn't viable?  What if she was trying to cut down on drinking for health related reasons?  What if she's taking meds that can't be mixed with alcohol?  **What if she simply didn't want to drink**?  You deserved to feel uncomfortable for that five minutes.  Do better next time.", "YTA\n\n>She also tends to be a heavy drinker during her visits, kind of a wild child. We are a drinking family but her siblings have all cut back since having kids and we have cut back as we got older ourselves, so she always drinks more than us now.\n\n\"So we know you're a lush, the only reason you won't drink must be because you're pregnant.\"\n\nWay to make your child feel welcome.", "YTA = She didn't want to drink. You guys kept pushing and pushing and pushing. You would not take no for an answer. You don't need an explanation for someone on why they won't do something, a simple NO is enough. Then you wouldn't take no as the answer to the pregnancy questions. You guys pushed her on both until your asshole wife set down a glass in front of her and basically made her drink it because obviously the two of you weren't going to STFU about it. But oh you're the one's that should be mad because she basically with one statement showed you how much of an asshole you guys are? I hope that she doesn't just let it blow over and goes LC with your guys. Learn to accept the word NO.", "YTA\nThis was such a weird story and really doesn\u2019t reflect you and your wife in a good light at all. Are people not allowed to abstain? As a diet or for their health or just because? \n\nDoes a 35 year old owe you personal information because you are her parents?\n\nFirst you insinuate that your daughter drinks too much. The when she comes to your home and isn\u2019t drinking you probe and prod and ultimately dare her to drink. \n\nWhen she then responds badly, you ask her to leave.\n\nYou and your wife are TA. If i were your daughter i would leave and stay away.", "YTA, absolutely. I'm surprised she even comes to visit you all as much as she does. You all massively overstepped. Why would your wife ask her in front of anyone if she was pregnant? It's NOT her business. It's not any of y'all's business. And not just asking once, but multiple times and demanding she drink if she's not pregnant- that's so immature to do. Imagine how she must have felt. What if she has a drinking problem and decided she's abstaining from now on? What if she just decided she wanted to enjoy y'all's company sober? Hell, maybe she was evaluating if being around y'all is so taxing, it causes her to drink more and wanted to try and see what the atmosphere was like sober. Honestly, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter why she isn't drinking. \"No.\" is a full sentence. You aren't entitled to more information just cause you're curious. She'll share if she wants to on her own time, which now she probably won't. You and your family are bullies. \n\nNow, as for her joke, it's actually pretty funny. You all are massively overreacting. In fact, it sounds like she's under reacting if she didn't book the next flight after the way you treated her. Your reaction doesn't make any sense. A single glass of wine occasionally while pregnant certainly doesn't cause FAS, the fetus would likely be fine. I feel so sorry for her, that whole situation is toxic af and the fact that you can't see that makes me think this isn't an isolated toxic event. It's the norm.", "so you guys peer pressured her into drinking. Awesome.", "\u201cMy scapegoat child with a drinking problem we judge her for wasn\u2019t doing the thing so we could judge her, so we backed her into a corner until she finally played our game.

He have decided that this deserves a wildly disproportionate punishment because how dare she finally snap back at us!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s you. That\u2019s what you sound like. YTA and get some therapy so you can actually work on your family issues instead of projecting them onto your daughter. Swallow your pride and apologize for this and every other time you\u2019ve done this to her.", "YTA - Why are you so nosey that you need to know why she isn't drinking? She's 35 years old and it's none of your business. And then your wife puts a glass in front of her as some stupid test? I wouldn't have been able to come up with as quick of a good retort as she did, but I wish I could have because you all deserved it. You guys have obviously all changed and gotten more conservative and uptight after having children and getting older. Well she doesn't seem to have, and she isn't like to. That doesn't make her a \"wild child\" at 35, it just means you guys live in two different worlds. She's not like you guys and that's OK. Stop trying to figure her out and let her be.", "YTA - you continued to probe on a topic and did not accept the answer provided by your daughter. She can change her drinking habits just like the rest of you in your family dad. You placing an ultimatum of sorts in front of everyone to prove a point was rude. She had every right to be angry that you would not accept her answer.", ">She denied and denied but something felt strange.

YTA no matter the outcome, your willingness to even do this is disgusting.", "YTA.  She didn't need to drink or explain why she didn't want to drink.  You all pressured her into drinking and deserved a few minutes of discomfort after making her uncomfortable for much longer.  \n\nDo better and apologize", "YTA. You accuse your daughter of playing dirty pool when it's you who were provoking and pushing. You just kept after her and wouldn't leave her alone until you escalated by setting her up. Now you're crying because she used pregnancy as a way to get you to stop. It sure seems like you and yours set her up. Can't blame her for being angry. \n\nSo what if she's not drinking. Why the constant pressure? It's very disturbing -may I say unhealthy?- that your family pushed alcohol on anyone, mucg less your daughter. If, indeed, she's chosen to abstain it's cruel and stupid to keep talking about alcohol. You may have intruded upon her recovery. This deserves some introspection on your part followed by a sincere apology.", "YTA-She didn\u2019t want to drink,you wouldn\u2019t let it go.

No wonder she\u2019s got a serious drinking problem with parents like that. Maybe she had enough of the heavy drinking and just chose to stop/possibly get proper help without telling anyone.

YTA.   Don't dish out disrespect for other autonomous adults if you can't take it yourself.", "You think she drinks too much (your opinion), so then you offer her drink after drink, and finish up with a double-dog dare for her to drink a glass of wine. WTAF?\n\nYTA. If I were her, I'd be eager to find a way to stay away from you. Her harmless prank was exactly that - no babies were, or could have been harmed by her drinking the wine.

When I returned it had been 2.5 years since I saw them. I\u2019d always enjoyed a few drinks but in that time I\u2019d developed a drinking problem. I got myself sober.

You say she wasn\u2019t \u2019an alcoholic as far as I know\u2019.  \nReally? As far as you know. So you don\u2019t know? \n\nAnd what if she was pregnant? Many don\u2019t publicise that til a certain time lapsed due to miscarriages. Or maybe as a child free person she wasn\u2019t keeping it.

Maybe she was on antibiotics, maybe her tummy wasn't feeling it, maybe she planned to do drugs and didn't want to mix, maybe she's trying to get healthy habits, or maybe- shocker I know, maybe she just didn't feel like drinking.. Even if she was pregnant you should have all dropped it instead of trying to force her to tell you before she was ready.

Number one would be the little comments you make like \"she is a hard drinker\" and \"she is a wild child\". So didnt feel like being judged but then was judged anyways for her choice of abstaining. She does not owe you an explanation if she does not feel like giving one. She is not hurting anyone by not drinking. You just seem like an AH in general, because even if you suspected she was pregnant the best way to coax that out of someone is NOT by offering alcohol and purposefully endangering the life of the child for stupid reason. Life is not a sitcom, yes you might have seen tv families do that but tv families are often highly disfunctional and not good examples to go by.\n\nThis is not more complicated than you may think. If she is struggling with alcoholism and is not in a place to share that yet, you pressuring her to share can set her back miles. If she is pregnant and does not want anyone to know because she is unsure of what to do with the child, again pressuring her to drink is not a good idea because she might make up her mind in that moment. There are 100's of reasons to cut back on drinking. Hell she might just be on a different diet and trying to lose weight but is embarrassed about it so decided she would just not drink. Or she might not like drinking around judgemental people, like you, anymore. Or she might not want to be drunk in front of kids. Who knows everyone has their own reasons. Like I prefer not drinking around my friends kids, and I am a person who when ever I go hang out generally will be sipping on some type of whisky or spirit. That does not mean I am an alcoholic trying to cut back or have some large secret I need to spill. It is just that I want to set a somewhat decent example (well atleast for the younger kids).", "YTA - she said no to alcohol one, offer her soft drink/juice instead. Why keep insisting she drink? What business is it of yours why she isn't drinking? \nSounds like she had the decorum to recognise that that wasn't the time to discuss why she's not drinking but she's surrounded by rude people who wouldn't show basic respect or tact.

It does not have any effect on you whatsoever.

Drinking while on the medication to treat a yeast infection is safe.", "Imagine the reaction dad would have", "And I just love his excuse for being so upset is the thought of her harming a non-existant child. As he is actively harming his own literal daughter by treating her like this", "Yep. I became evasive with overstepping questions and comments from colleagues and acquaintances  when I was on a diet for my health. Nobody's business but mine.", "I remember one time I was on an antibiotic that everyone from the doctor, to the nurse, to the pharmacists was like \u201cyou will *die* if you drink alcohol while on this,\u201d so I was like, cool I won\u2019t drink. \n\nEvidently, this was offensive to my (at the time) friend\u2019s group, because, how dare I not get smashed to celebrate so-and-so\u2019s birthday. \n\nThe fact that I finally had to show my prescription to one of the girls in the group who was a nurse, so she could tell everyone to layoff, was the end of my friendship with those folks.", "Seems to me the parents were more butt hurt about her essentially calling them on their crap when she drank the wine, so they want her out of the house to forget their own screw up....oh wait, it can't be their fault, so it must be their daughter's fault.", "I grew up in a house like this. Pry pry pry, you snap, they're horrified you didn't act like the little pet you were supposed to. \"It was all for fun, our prying\" \"we pry because we care\" and my favorite \"I'm the parent, it's my right to pry\". Same parents were SHOCKED when I moved as far away from them as I could while staying in the country. Oh, and happy cake day!", "It could just even be that alcohol gives her heartburn. As I got older it happened to me, and that\u2019s why I rarely drink.", "I have to take tramadol for life for chronic back pain and have been told to avoid alcohol or it could be dangerous.

They need everyone to join in so they get validation that their (excessive) drinking is okay.", "Ding ding ding we have a winner! Most \u201chigh functioning\u201d alcoholics I\u2019ve encountered (like my entire family) refuse to believe they\u2019re alcoholics because they can control their behaviour and not let it interfere with their professional life but they don\u2019t see a problem with the fact they can\u2019t even get through a kids party without a beer", "That seems almost certainly true", "Yeah my father loses his mind if there's any suggestion that alcohol is anything but perfect, I had to stop reading and calm myself down halfway through the post because I've been in this exact situation.", "And by saying \u201cin this family we believe..\u201d, OP is clearly inferring that you are not part of the family if you don\u2019t conform to the belief.", "My mom\u2019s side of the extended family are HEAVY drinkers, including a couple true alcoholics. A couple drink and drive, they\u2019re all cool with underage drinking as long as it stays in the house, there\u2019s a fully stocked wet-bar downstairs, the whole 9 yards. Yet somehow even my tactless extended family never felt the need to peer pressure me or anyone else into joining along when we didn\u2019t feel like it for any reason. There was always a case of soda or water bottles available in case someone wasn\u2019t up for a hard drink. OP can\u2019t even blame that for their behavior, they just suck.", "I have family members like this and they definitely have alcohol problems. Most of my family members are either recovering alcoholics that are \"off limits\" in terms of pressuring to drink, or the other half in denial they're alcoholics who haggle me & the 3 other people that aren't messing with that shit", "One of my coworkers used this trick, too, but it\u2019s still ridiculous it needs to be a thing \u2639\ufe0f", "Me too\u2026", "Putting this in my pocket for myself and others, thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Yeah I realized that I had it backwards but also hit reply anyways.", "The classic case of the imaginary child is more important than the one that exists.", "Yes, excellent point!", "But, but, but THE IMAGINARY FETUS!
