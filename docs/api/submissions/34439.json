I had moved in with my dad and his gf (not sure how old she is but I don't really care since I don't like her for reasons soon to be explained). His gf used to be super nice and supportive with me and my siblings, but something had changed and she seeks to cause issues between me, my siblings, and our dad because there is always some kind of problem with her and one of my siblings. She gave me a lot of bs while I lived with her and my dad and gave my dad an ultimatum: me or her (even going to the lengths of threatening to break up with him and off herself if she did not get her way, which she had threatened to do and even attempted to do multiple times when he tried to break up with her before). They even told me in their words \"we don't care where you end up, but you can't stay here\". This was about 2 or 3 years ago and I had my dad cut out of my life for most of that period. I had also moved back in with my mom to finish high school and start college online. I tried to start giving my dad a chance in my life again, only seeing him twice in person since I moved out with the condition that I did not want to be around his gf despite how unhappy he was with it. I thought it was a good idea to try and talk to him again but I regret that now.\n\nI was on my way home from celebrating New Year with my mom and siblings when my Nana, aka my dad's mom, sent me some pictures. I looked at them and saw that she sent picture of my dad holding up proposal balloons saying that his gf said yes to him proposing! I was pissed from this since my dad never talked about it and vented to my bestie (f19) about it. I ended up asking my dad why he didn't tell me or my siblings about it and he first defended himself by saying my Nana was sharing information that she had no right to share, but then got mad at me because that was the first thing I had said and didn't congratulate him. My Nana then also went on a tirade, saying that she regret telling us the news because someone was jealous, talking shit on my mom after. My dad then apologized to me in private messages and I blocked them both. I feel bad because I know my dad was divorced for over a decade and my Nana barely leaves her house anymore, so I doubt she barely talks to anyone anymore.

It sounds like his now fiance at some point said \"it's me or OP\" and he chose her and not you. That's a horrific thing to do to your child, and he has no right to expect any relationship with you or congrats on his engagement. \"Thanks for sticking the knife in harder, and twisting it, dad\".", "NTA\n\nWhy would you have a reason to congratulate him on marrying someone you hate? That would be dishonest.", "NTA. Dad was an absolute dick to you. From the sound of it he never tried to make amends or maintain a relationship with you after he chose his girlfriend over you. Any parent who prioritizes a piece of ass over their minor child is 100% worthless imo. I know the downvotes are coming for me on this but I don\u2019t care. Your dad tossed you out of his life without a backward glance. FOR A PIECE OF ASS. Fuck him. Fuck anyone who doesn\u2019t tell him that he\u2019s a shit parent and a worthless human. You owe him nothing. He showed you who he really is - believe him. Remove him from your life. Get therapy if you need it. Surround yourself with people who love and respect you. (For the record, I have a teen daughter and I would laugh my ass off if a grown ass adult said chose between him and my kid. Chose the kid every damn time and kick the prick to the curb.) \n\nGuarantee that when he\u2019s old and his piece of ass has dumped him he will come calling with a bullshit line re \u201cI\u2019m your dad and you have to take me in/take care of me/come and see me/give me $ etc.\u201d Absolutely not. Parents have a duty of care toward their children. He brought children into this world and chose to raise them. His duty is toward you. You, as a child who was discarded, have no obligation to him.\n\nFuck him. Fuck anyone who defends his actions. Be gentle with yourself while you sort through this traumatic shit show. I wish you peace, healing, and all good things. \u2764\ufe0f", "I am really trying to tell people to be authentic rather than fake. You have a right to your feelings. I feel for you.

His gf was making sure he wouldn't gave a relationship with his kids anyway", "ESH, especially your dad and his GF for obvious reasons but you\u2019re no saint either. \n\nYou don\u2019t have a right to that information, You both cut each other out of your lives & even said you\u2019ve seen each other only twice since reconnecting. it\u2019s his information to give therefore you have no reason to be upset. Given that you and her absolutely don\u2019t get along, it\u2019s likely your dad omitted that information for the sake of preserving his already fragile relationship with you. \n\nYour dad sucks cause his immediate thought was you didn\u2019t congratulate them knowing the history between you 2. \n\nNana sucks too. To me she sent you the pics to get a rise out of your mom as she jump straight to the jealousy conclusion.", "ESH there\u2019s a lot of bad behavior here, so it\u2019s understandable why you reacted the way you did.  It is difficult to truly be happy for your father when his fianc\u00e9 has acted so badly.  \n\nStill, it doesn\u2019t help to make this situation about you.  He got engaged.  This is his life event.  Don\u2019t make it about you or how/when you found out - because why does that even matter?  You\u2019ve made it clear you\u2019re not close to him.   And it costs you nothing to say congratulations. \n\nYou\u2019re 19, and although you\u2019ve received a lot of bad examples of how adults behave, it\u2019s time for you to decide what kind of adult you are going to be.  Are you going to ramp up the drama as you did in this case?  And continue the bad behavior you have seen with your father and grandmother?  Because you don\u2019t have to. You can decide to be a better person than they are. You can just accept that your father has made and is making decisions that you don\u2019t agree with, and be civil. Be the bigger person.", "ESH. Your dad obviously sucks, but you hardly have a relationship with him, so why would you expect that he'd talk to you about his plans to propose, especially when you and his gf don't get along (not blaming you for that, just stating that fact). Get on his case for choosing his gf over his own kids, absolutely, but don't call and start shit because he didn't include you in his proposal.", "ESH.
