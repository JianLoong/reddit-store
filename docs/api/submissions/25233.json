My fiancee always accuses me of \u201astaring\u2018 at other women. I truly reflected my behaviour critically and I\u2018m not \u201astaring\u2018. I never turn my head or look at any other woman more than a second, I truly love and desire my fiancee and am loyal to her. Me looking into a direction where a woman stands is always enough to be accused of \u201astaring\u2018 at her and causing arguments, even as in the most cases I didn\u2018t even noticed any person as I was looking for something else. It went so far that I on purpose avoid crowded areas when I\u2018m with her. \n\nThis being said, we went to a popular, busy caf\u00e9 in our hometown (NY). I ordered us coffee and we sat down at a table facing the order counter and the que. I was thinking about to order cake for us and thus faced the order counter as the cakes were presented there. While trying to figure out which cake I want, a group of 3 women left the que at the order counter and went to the table behind us while passing me and blocking my view on the cake. I didn\u2018t turned my head or anything, but naturally had this group of women in my field of vision and of course noticed them for a second. My fiancee immediately accused me of \u201apurposely staring at women again like a weirdo\u2018.\n\nWe had an argument as always. I was accused of being a weirdo stares. I was so sick of these arguments, so tired of always being accused of staring and feeling uncomfortable in public areas with her that I vented a bit. I was still relatively calm, but I shouldn\u2018t have said the following while defending myself. I said \u201aI never had these accusations in any prior relationship, I\u2018m not a weirdo as you call me\u2018. I know this was not clever.\n\nThis escalated the situation to an even bigger argument, her accusing me of comparing her with my ex-partners. She said that she also now will compare me with her ex-partners as I did the same and said \u201awell, at least they all had huge thick dicks\u2018. I couldn\u2018t believed what I\u2018ve heard and how quickly this escalated. I asked her \u201athis is hurtful to me, how would you feel if I would say something corresponding like \u201aat least they all had huge boobs\u2018 about my exes?\u2018. I didn\u2018t communicated any statement or personal opinion, but simply mirrored her statement as a question to make her realize how rude and hurting her statement was.\n\nShe broke up, saying IATA and deserve being insulted. \n\nI know it was wrong and poorly communicated, I shouldn\u2019t have said that even as a question.

If I'm reading this right, you two broke up? Bullet dodged, dude.

You basically dodged a toxic bullet...", "NTA. RUN FOR THE HILLS!!!", "NTA - she sounds very insecure and as if she's projecting that onto you.

You do not want to hitch yourself to that wagon. I'm going to guess she broke up with you so you will come crawling back to her, begging for forgiveness. Please don't. This is hyper levels of insecurity and you will be miserable for the rest of your life dealing with that crap.", "NTA. She clearly has a lot of insecurities and is acting out towards you as an ineffective defence mechanism. Not your circus, not your monkeys. Move on.", "NTA - Let Miss Psycho go and move on", "You dodged a whole lot of crazy there, now just move on and forget the psycho, NTA", "She broke up with you to try and make a point so she can further manipulate you.

You should probably stay broken up, sounds like you got out of a future shitty relationship", "Dude, staring is one thing, being aware of your surroundings, noticing that there are humans around, or just staring off into space are all things people do.

You never become this involved with another persons gaze without either crippling trauma, or guilt. So either she has been cheated on badly or repetitively in the past (which she would have brought up during an argument or before being engaged), or she's looking at other guys or cheating, and has the guilt making her act that way.\n\nThe fact she broke it off so quickly makes me wonder if she wanted to end it before? Or maybe genuinely expects men to never stand up for themselves?\n\nEither way, NTA.

You got out with a huuuuggge win!!  Be thankful and go live your best life!", "NTA\n\nYou have avoided a miserable marriage, followed by an even more painful divorce.  Count your blessings.  She is insecure, and her willingness to fight in public over such BS is a huge red flag.  Walk away, don't run.  You were lucky.  \n\nNo one deserves to be insulted like this, especially publicly.", "If you are being absolutely honest with yourself and you are not looking at other women, and it seems you are being honest, then your GF is bordering on being delusional.

Therapy might help, but subclinical delusional disorder is pretty hard to treat.", "NTA stay broken up", "You better get a prenuptial agreement if you get weak and decide to get back with her...Also NTA.", "NTA - She wasn't acting as a logical mature adult. She clearly has some insecurities or trust issues and likely would never have stopped and would move on to other things to call you out on in the future.", "Do not reconcile with this person. You will live a miserable life looking down at the floor to lift their low self esteem and make them feel secure.

You were defending yourself in the only way possible way, and she heard it as a statement about those other women instead of what it was; a statement about you.

She even used some kind of app on me that can keep track of someone else's instagram follows, and she would also accuse me of staring at other women even if my glance just passed by them.

You definitely dodged a bullet here.", "Er, adding more red flags to a pile of red flags. Accusing partners of cheating when they go anywhere   Is an abuser\u2019s tactic.
