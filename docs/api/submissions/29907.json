But this year they came over for the holidays because we just had a child, so we decided to split our presence for lunches between the 2 families. \nWe planned to spend the first 2 meals with mine (friday\u2019s dinner and saturday\u2019s lunch) and the next 2 with my inlaws \n\nBut my inlaws said they wanted us to stay over for the night in their appartment. Saying it was dangerous to go back to our place late at night\n\nWe said we didn\u2019t want to because:\n-we live 10 minutes away in a pretty safe neighbourhood that we know well \n-we have a newborn (2month old) wich meant bringing lot of stuff over and quite a lot of hussle \n-we didn\u2019t want to sleep on a couch in the living room \nAll this to avoid a 10 minute walk \n\nThey said if we didn\u2019t stay for the night they\u2019d prefer not invite us at all\nAt that point it was clear they just wanted to bargain with us to have us more time at their house, thinking we would rather agree than spend the holiday alone. So we made it clear that we were NOT going to sleep over, and they stood their ground saying they didn\u2019t want to invite us then. \n\nSo I called my parents and asked them to invite us for that dinner and they agreed \n\nWhen they heard about it and realized their plan failed, they backed out and said they agreed to invite us without us staying over (wich for me really shows it was a scheme all along) \nAt that point (wich was 3 days before the said lunch) my inlaws started to call my wife all day to insist on us coming over but we told them it was too late to cancel my parents \nSince then they started to really resent me, saying it was my fault, because I could just change plans with my parents \n\nTo be fully honest, since I understood very well what they were up to back then, I kinda jumped on the occasion to change plans, thinking I would avoid some hussle and then stood my ground to avoid have them \u00ab\u00a0win\u00a0\u00bb\n\nSo AITA for not changing plans to go to dinner at my inlaws? \n\nImportant point: we were still scheduled to lunch with them the next day, wich we went to as planned (although the mood was quite cold)", "created_utc": 1698580982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17j1hg2/aita_for_refusing_an_invite_from_my_inlaws/", "score": 475, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s unreasonable to constantly expect them to buy more and cook more just to waste it half the time incase you turned up for dinner. Mine always pulled out what they wanted to cook for dinner to defrost each morning. Show suddenly showing up expecting to be fed would inconvenience them.\n\n When I was single then yes if I was there they\u2019d offer dinner when what they were cooking would work for more people. Once I was married with my own family then no you don\u2019t expect it without warning and without an invite. When we stayed further away and would stay with them when we visited then yes they\u2019d feed us as we are family and they where hosting us.   \nThey may be your parents but it\u2019s a respect thing just like I\u2019d hate them turning up at my door expecting me to cook for a number of extra people when the meal I\u2019d bought in to cook wouldn\u2019t work for more people. Visiting is one thing but for meals they invited us prior or asked us if we wanted to stay for dinner when they had enough.

When they found out, they expected you jump back on board, just not stay over. \n\nYou were right to refuse to refuse to break your parents. You accomplished two things. Making sure they understand that when you say \"No\" you mean it. And when you plans with someone, you won't back out because someone else wants you to do something with them.

OP's parents live in a different country so they rarely get to see them. \n\nThey might feel like they're behind, but it seems like they're just selfish and don't want the other grandparents to get any time. \n\nHonestly, I'm not sure why OP isn't spending the entire time with his family since it seems like this is the first time his parents will be meeting the newborn and they see his wife's parents constantly.", "I think you mean his parents.
