However, last week, the neighbor next to us who also shares part of her fence with the wood worker texted me to see if we're as bothered by the noise as she is. We absolutely are! \n\nWhen he started up this morning, I finally decided to say something. While he was using his very loud wood planer, I popped my head over the fence and spent nearly a minute trying to get his attention. When he noticed me and stopped, I calmly explained to him that his wood working was very loud, especially considering he starts so early, and this was disrupting my ability to (quietly) work from home. At first, he said he'd \"try to start a couple hours later,\" but I responded that it's the noise in general that's so disruptive, not just the time; I also pointed out that other neighbor's were bothered by it.\n\nHe explained that wood working is his job, which he also does from home. I asked him if he might consider moving his work to the garage, but he said that's not possible.

Did I overstep my bounds? Am I the one being selfish? Or was I right to call this guy out for being so loud every damn day?\n\nEDIT: My neighbor, who is also bothered by the noise, looked into it and found that in our county, any noise in a residential zone that is consistently over 50 dBA when heard from another property is in violation of the ordinance. My Apple Watch indicates that even from inside by home, his wood working sometimes breaks 100 dBA. This morning, just before I went to talk with him, it showed 92 dBA *from inside my insulated house.*\n\nEDIT: I just opened the door to let my dog out and heard the tools, but they were massively muted.

You should look into what maybe you can do to block out the noise. Maybe put up sound proofing foam on your work rooms walls or something.", "NAH. Your neighbor has offered to start later in the morning. Maybe there are options for you sound proofing the room you work from.", "NAH. Yet...\n\nSo, the first thing to do is look up to see if your city/town has a noise ordinance. If so, find out what the restrictions are and share those with your neighbor. For example, in my city, 8:00am is the earliest they can start on weekdays and Saturday, 10:00am on Sunday. The latest they can go is 8:00pm on any day. There are also decibel level limits. This will also help you see whether or not the authorities would be able to help you with respect to when he makes noise.\n\nThe other thing to consider is whether or not his property is zoned for commercial work out of the home. If not, you and the other complaining neighbor could make an enemy for life, but could file a complaint with the city and get his home business shut down.

But you're upset about the noise. Sorry, but that's life. Get over it.", "NTA. Residential noise ordinances are not just for the time of day. They apply to the level of noise (decibels) and how often. Consistent noise above the stated residential decibel is a violation. Working on your house? Great.

Other people shouldn't have to accommodate you by sacrificing their hobbies or job if it's not keeping you up at night. Put on some headphones.", "NAH. I don't understand how someone could see that as being an asshole from only saying someone's actions are selfish. You both were polite and honest with each other for the duration of your conversation!\n\nI would say it's worth looking into your HOA's sound ordinance, but it sounds like he's already doing his work in the time frame asked of him.", "YTA man is just trying to work.", "YTA. He's allowed to do his work in his yard. If you don't like the noise, YOU can do something to mitigate the noise in YOUR property. His reaction is spot on the right reaction.", "I don't think either of you are an asshole based on this description, you have conflicting interests but both of your positions are relatively reasonable. Continue to talk to him, not just about the noise but get to know your neighbor and help him know you. \n\nThe more you talk the easier it will be to find a compromise, but keep in mind that he can't simply stop making noise any more than you could simply stop being affected by it.", "NAH. You are in stage 1 of problem solving. That neither of you has a solution doesn't make either of you an asshole. Neither of you is being selfish, y'all got to figure this out.", "NAH. It is unreasonable to ask him to stop making the noise completely as it\u2019s his work and livelihood, so that made me nearly vote Y T A.

Probably selling on etsy or at craft fairs. That's \"crafting\" more than \"construction\".", "Where did you get 14+ hours from? 7am to 12pm is 5 hours.", "Well dang! Sounds like someone needs to remind the neighbor that! Good luck, friend.", "FIVE hours, not FOURTEEN. He's a retired man for goodness sake. He works from 7am to noon.", "Yeah, but he's wrong. He said the noise ordinance is 50 dBA. That's a very soft conversation.", "You keep spam posting this but 7am-12pm is FIVE hours lol", "He does sound stubborn, speaking as a woodworker I can say there are definitely ways to reduce his noise output that he's probably not considering.", "The neighbor is not in compliance with the local noise ordinance. Below is OP's comment:\n\nMy neighbor who is also bothered by the noise looked into it and found   \nthat in our county, any noise in a residential zone that is consistently  \n over 50 dBA when heard from another property is in violation of the   \nordinance. My Apple Watch indicates that even from inside by home, his   \nwood working sometimes breaks 100 dBA.", "Yea, but I can see why that doesn't actually solve anything. Starting at noon over 9 sure gives you 3 more quiet hours but if my work doesn't need that quiet till noon doesn't really do anything. Part of problem solving is understanding what issues are. Sure its clear the noise is not desirable, we know now that its necessary. What are our options? Thats where resolution happens.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying. However, short of moving his work to the garage (which he\u2019s already said he\u2019s unable to do), what do you suggest he can do to shield the noise?", "I commented before your edit to include how loud he is.   I do feel for you, I also work from home and my street is quiet (lots of retired/elderly neighbors by me) but I have worked in loud environments previously and have become quite good at drowning out noise. \n\nIf he is breaking an ordinance, I\u2019d call local police to look into it and report to correct county agencies (maybe your commissioner\u2019s office). They will likely enforce it and possibly look into if he needs to have a permit. \n\nThe down side is it will likely take time and now he may become hostile toward you.", "Ah, my mistake.\n\nSticking with ESH.  He can work 9 to 2 and give you a few hours without noise.  It's up there with mowing your lawn at 7 am on a Saturday.  Just no. And my YTA is a soft ATA.  I get where you're coming from.\n\nAnyway, good luck.", "Is he doing construction? Or building a bookshelf? It's not clear and I am not sure I'd call furniture-making \"construction\".", "The decibels seem to be a problem.", "Many places also make the distinction between commercial and residential.", "Two other neighbors are planning to chat with him about the noise today, in fact I think one already has. I'm not saying majority rules, but I would hope he'd at least take into consideration the fact his noise is seriously impacting multiple neighbors. \n\nI'm getting the idea that a lot of people responding have likely never heard a wood planer. They're so fucking loud, it's hard to explain.", "*He* said it was his job, and our ordinance refers to \"construction-type work,\" meaning typical tasks involve in construction such as cutting and planing wood.", "Decibels are on a logarithmic scale if I remember correctly, and you usually measure a noise source from 1 metre away to get an accurate reading. If you're measuring from an adjoining property and it's still registering as 50dB or more, then you can bet it's a very loud and intrusive noise.", "*Consistent noise over 50 dBA as heard from another property.*", "Wood carving is a far cry from wood planing, especially when it comes to the noise.", "So you agree, they're NTA for wanting him to be within compliance of sound ordinance laws? \n\nNowhere did they say they wanted him to stop fully. Reread op.", "Planers are extremely loud. My neighbors across the street and two houses down recently had work done for a few weeks. I didn\u2019t see every tool that was used but the noise was loud enough that I could hear it clearly inside my house. It didn\u2019t bother me as they weren\u2019t running continuously but I could definitely hear it.", "Even with the evening time blunder, morning was still too early and the biggest problem is the noise ordinance said nothing more than 50 DB on neighboring properties, day or night. So he is still in the wrong there for having double that noise allowance happening. If not for that, then I would tell OP to just deal with it. \n\nIf the neighbor can't legally do the stuff at home, he can rent a storage unit and do the work there. Or fix his garage to be able to work inside it. Or build a sound proof shed if he has the room for it and ability.", "*Consistently over* 50 dBA *when heard from another property.* This morning, my watch indicated the noise was at 92 dBA *from inside my otherwise silent house.*", "I'm not certain of OPs gender, are you?", "We're opting not to go the legal route, at least for now. We have no beef with the dude, we just want him to be a little more considerate of his neighbors by building a work shed or something.", "This is exactly what my other neighbor was telling me, and while we're hoping to avoid getting the county involved at all, we may resort to the non-emergency line if the dude does nothing to shield the sound he makes.", "I'll edit the original post!\n\nWe would report it to a non-emergency line, they'd send someone out to evaluated the sound, then go from there.", "You are not alone in that!", "Without knowing where OP resides, I can not verify the ordinance, but hobby woodworking would not be allowed AT ALL if this ordinance reads as OP opines. \n\n**Noise Sources That Are 50 dB**\n\n*50 decibels is a safe, quiet noise level comparable to the following common sounds:*\n\nA quiet conversation\nA quiet office or home\nA quiet residential street\nA quiet refrigerator\nModerate rainfall\n\nSo even \"moderate rainfall\" or a refrigerator exceeds the legal noise limit?", "No soundproof windows fully stop external sound. Have you ever heard what the noise a planer makes? It's wildly loud.", "The neighbor's noise exceeds the noise ordinance code. He will be obligated to create new options if this is reported. In the meantime the neighbors are attempted to have a conversation with him that results in a solution for all.", "My bad. Thinking and typing too fast. Thxs for the clarification. -- Edit is completed.", "Residential neighborhoods are zoned for construction you just need a permit. They are not zoned to be an office or a workshop. You\u2019re not allowed to literally have a business in a residential house, but it does vary by locality, which is why I said they should look into it.", "Oops. My error. Thinking and typing too fast.", "At this stage it is reportedly a loud conversation. Hope all neighbors can experience a shift to the positive.", "I am actively correcting the hour error. I'm communicating directly to those who posted YTA since OP's new information may drastically impact a vote change. In the past I have appreciated others updating me when critical information became available.", "I honestly don't think this is a real \"job,\" but a sign making hobby that generates some fun money. Pretty sure he's retired.", "Ahh, that comment was made after mine. In that case, OP is NTA.", "OP should tell that to neighbor and see what neighbor does. I fundamentally disagree with notion that someone becomes an asshole just because its learned taht they are outside bounds of law. You become an asshole when you learn that and persist. \n\nThis appears to be first time neighbor learned this was even an issue; not say immediately saying he'll go buy some sound dampening panels and put up when he is working doesn't make him an asshole.", "All the neighbors except one abides by the noise ordinance. The best solution may evolve and it would do so quickly if the wood working neighbor accepts the law and changes behavior.", "Install a work shed. He keeps his table saw and planer under a tarp in his backyard currently. If this is his job, and he's a wood worker, he should be able to build a shed himself that would shield upwards of 60% of the sound, which is all we're asking.", "Thanks again. Just to be clear, the difference in noise between a wood planer and a lawn mower is incredibly vast. It's hard to explain in words just how loud a planer is. Imagine the sound dental drills make but amplified 100 times. He has to wear ear protection when using it, and if I'm in my backyard, it legit hurts to the point I have to cover my ears.", "Yea, I normally would agree, but if the noise is 100+ db in OP\u2019s home it\u2019s unacceptable, regardless of what neighbor is doing. \n\nApparently 90+db is when sustained exposure may cause hearing loss. And is about as loud as a train whistle from 500\u2019 away. No one wants to hear that for 5 hours straight, especially in the early morning EVERY day. \n\nI lived about 500\u2019 from a train track, and it\u2019s *loud*. You get used to it. It only happens a few times a day for a total \u2018loud time\u2019 of MAYBE 5 minutes. But FIVE HOURS? I\u2019d be pissed.", "Yea but if dude I'd making like 1 piece a week it doesn't qualify for anything drastic.", "Woodworking is not classified as construction in the sense your ordinance states.", "That\u2019s not construction. Wtf do you think construction means lmao", "Yeah, I understand that part. I guess I'm not used to living in a quiet area. Where I live, just traffic noise as heard from my yard would exceed 50 dB.", ">they're NTA for wanting him to be within compliance of sound ordinance laws\n\nSure, wanting anything is fine, they can want whatever they want. But if he's in violation of the ordinances, that's between him and the county, and trying to get the whole neighborhood to harass him instead of just telling the county is not cool. But even so, I remain skeptical that he actually is violating anything other than perhaps starting a bit earlier, which he agreed to change (but which wasn't good enough for OP.) \n\nI will be *floored* if he's actually so loud that he's violating noise ordinance by working in the middle of the day. Before 8 or 9 am, sure, but once it gets to 10, 11, 12? You really think a lathe or a circular saw or whatever is so loud as to be illegal at noon?", "Sound ordinances are nighttime and lift at 7am.", "I bet it's a night to morning ordinance and not day time.", "Again, a normal conversation would violate that ordinance. Go ahead and report him, Let's see how that goes for you.", "Most noise ordinances are from 10pm-7am. I doubt neighbor is in violation", "I mean, fair. I edited it to be gender neutral, but you didn't reply to the actual content of that comment.", "Don't mean suing them or anything, just ask them what they think the best chat to neighbor would be.", "I bet its louder than 50dBA", "It's a night time code. He's daytime.", "From your other comments I think you're going about this the right way, have the other neighbors talk to him as well, let him know his community needs some sort of change, and if he's totally unwilling to find a solution that everyone can accept then you have the noise ordinance to back you up", "We live in a very quiet suburb.", "OP said their county has day and night ordinances than shouldn't exceed 50 DB. Not everywhere is the same, that's why I told them to go check their area.", "They have no legal basis.  Sound ordinance is nighttime and woodworking isn't classified as construction.", "I could not find a clarification of night vs. day code.", "I'd love to read the actual ordinance. It be the first I've seen with a daytime noise", "OP said there is an ordinance for day and night, not just night in their county. If that's true, neighbor might not have legal ground to continue his activities. But I dunno, that's why I suggest OP take it to legal thread if it is as bad as it sounds and ask what best way would be to approach him.", "Counties don't have daytime sound ordinances in general. I've never seen a county that has one.", "Most cities likely do have daytime ordinances, they may not be known to everyone, though.

Your work is not more important than his work", "It's the size of the lot (land), not the house.", "Sounds like OP\u2019s job doesn\u2019t piss off his neighbours 5 hours a day, EVERY day. \n\nThat\u2019s not sometimes noise, that\u2019s a prolonged noise nuisance.\n\nPeople also sleep and stuff in their houses.\n\nOP is NTA.", "Running a planer that isn't in a garage or shed is LOUD. You damn sure wear hearing protection when you run one.", "How many bookshelves does this motherfucker need?", "How do you think those Etsy people make all those charcuterie boards.", "Apparently he is an older/retired man who makes crafty signs for extra money. 'Construction' implies something different. He's not building a skyscraper.", "Great ending.", "NTA for how you talked to him and handled it. \n\nNow before going on the whole noise ordinance issue. Did you use a dB meter because the iphone app doesn't legally count as it is measuring all noise not that specifically like an official test would do. Also in my county the noise ordinance doesn't stand up if it is between 7am-5pm. Then it is just tough luck dude law is on his side. My dad has done the side gigs of woodworking and has used a wood planer before and it is loud but never call the cops loud esp when he would leave the door open to the garage and everyone could hear it. Just because your neighbor said this one small portion doesn't mean she fully read it and not just the part she wanted to see. Just be careful how it is all approached because law might not be on your side", "ESH.   He offered to start a couple hours later, but NOPE you want the neighbor to tip toe around so YOU can control what he does on his own property.   Call the county if you want, if they actually do something, great.   But be prepared for the consequences.   Do you want to make this your hill to die on?   My parents live out in the country, one neighbor started renting his back field to semi truck drivers and other people with large vehicles.   One other neighbor decided they didn't like the traffic and called the county.   The land wasn't zoned for a parking lot, so neighbor got a cease and desist letter from county.   Neighbor was pissed but  stopped renting out to trucks.   Since the land is zoned for farming, he decided to take up pig farming.     As he doesn't like smell, he moved the pig pen, to the far side of his property which coincidentally is right next to busy body neighbor.     So I would think long and hard about if you really want to escalate this.", "I seriously doubt any self-storage would allow that.", "It's not 100db in OPs home, he's probably using a phone app, not a factory calibrated db metter.", "I've read that 3x and don't see where it says what the permissible decibel level is.", "YTA, you can ask him to start later or stop earlier but you don't get to tell him he can't do it at all!", "A 100 dBa? That's insane! In some countries that's the legal limit for music player at concerts / nightclubs etc. It's about as loud as you can go before causing permanent damage to your ears when exposed to for longer periods of time. Definitely NTA, I'm surprised no other neighbor complained sooner!\n\nAnd may I add, I had to Google how big 8500 Square Foot is (789.67584 Square Meter, if my google skills didn't fail me). I love how you describe that as \"by no means large\". That's huuuuge to me. You must live somewhere lovely.", "It's under \"DAYTIME DECIBEL LIMIT \u2013 RESIDENTIAL\", and it's 65dB with some exceptions. You can go up to 70dB for no more than 2 hours of the day, 75 for no more than an hour, 80 for no more than 30 minutes, and 85 for no more than 15 minutes."]}
