Like my in-laws got my kid a United shirt and he told them he would rather die than wear it so he didn't wear it.", "If she wants to wear it YTA, let her make up her mind, it\u2019s also not everyday there\u2019s a coronation in England but I\u2019m kind of weird, I like the monarchy but mostly it\u2019s history i guess.", "NTA. She\u2019s too young to understand the violent history of the British empire. She doesn\u2019t have the education to make an \u201cinformed decision.\u201d However, I wouldn\u2019t worry about a shirt commemorating a historical moment indoctrinating her.  The person who made her the shirt is out of line. If it were me I wouldn\u2019t accept it or show her in the first place if she doesn\u2019t know about it. And this is coming from an American who plans to stay up late to watch it here.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to make your child be walking pro royal propaganda just bc someone else thinks it\u2019s a good idea.", "YTA. \n\nI will say your mom overstepped her bounds in buying the t-shirt, unless your 8-year-old specifically wanted it. Nonetheless, it should have been discussed. \n\nHowever, you say you try to raise her to be socially aware and to create her own opinions on things. If your daughter wants to wear the t-shirt, she should be able to. Who cares? An 8-year-old wearing a t-shirt with King Charles\u2019 face on it will not single-handedly be the approval stamp for the entire UK to usher in the next age of the monarchy. \n\nThis is a historic event, and it will be a fun story for her to tell her grandkids one day that she remembers the coronation when she was a little girl, and how she wore a t-shirt with King Charles\u2019 face and her parents hated it. It would become a cherished memory of how you stand up for not only what you believe in, but also for what your daughter believes in because you love her. Let her wear the t-shirt if she wants.", "YTA because you make a point of saying that 1) you want to raise your daughter to make up her own mind about things; and 2) you\u2019ve already decided she won\u2019t be wearing the shirt. So much for letting her make up her own mind! I guess that only works if she makes up her mind to think like you.", "Sounds like a photo opportunity to me.  A moment in cringe to look back on and be embarrassed about when she's older, that time when her 8 year old self wore a t-shirt celebrating the rise of Chuck and his old mare. \n\nLet her see the cringe t-shirt first, respect her decision whatever it is and that's a NAH.", "I think people would have a different perspective if the shirt was emblazoned with a tie-dyed swastika or KKK emblem.

If she doesnt or dont rly care, they dont really have a say", "NTA It is your and your husband daughter.\n\nHowever you are kidding yourself when you say \"We also try to raise her to be socially aware and to make her own mind up about things.\"  You are indoctrinating her in YOUR way of thinking. Otherwise wearing a t-shirt would not be a big deal", "YTA. You state you try and let her make up her own mind on things, then state your forbidding her from wearing it because you don\u2019t agree with her. It\u2019s one or the other OP? You don\u2019t have to like the monarchy, I\u2019m indifferent to it, but she\u2019s 8 and should be allowed to decide if she wants to wear a tshirt with his face in it.", "I've thought of a compromise! She can only wear the shirt if she ah...decorates it in some interesting way :) \n\nOkay, serious answer to this is, does the kid want to wear the shirt, or does she care on any level? Because if you raise her to make up her own mind, then...do it?", "NTA if anyone bought my child a Trump shirt and encouraged her to wear it I would lose my damn mind.", "NTA It's a shirt.

It's best for you to stand your ground.", "Nta", "Like it or not, Charles is both the titular head of your country and its visual figurehead.\n\nI can respect being anti-monarchy\u00b9, but to deny your daughter the trappings of a monumental event in the modern history of your country seems petulant. It's reminiscent of the people who, in the US, wear \"he's not my president\" T-shirts. \n\nYTA. \n\n\u00b9as in to call for reform or abolition. I've less respect if one tries to pretend it's not a thing", "You are leaving out two most important things, firstly daughters age and second if she wants to wear it. On this gotta go yta", "NTA, I think.\n\nA lot depends on your daughter. You may be an AH if your daughter wants to wear the shirt and you don't let her do so.  She'll probably grow out of it in a year or two, so let her wear it if she does want to wear it.\n\nIf it doesn't specifically mention King Chuck or his coronation, ignore your mother's intent and say it is nothing more than a patriotic t-shirt. If it does mention Chuck and your daughter doesn't want to wear it (or has outgrown it), you've acquired a nice rag for washing the windows.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you want your daughter to make her own mind, and you did explain your stance to her, why not ask her if she wants to or not? so that she would actually grow up making informed choices and not being coerced into one thing or another just because \u201cmom and dad said so\u201d or \u201cgrandma said so\u201d.", "I chuckled heartily at this comment. Well done, sir", "I mean, from how Charlie looks there'll probably be another one inside 5 years", "OP is free to decide whether or not the child wears such a t-shirt, but I doubt the gift is about OP's mother's political beliefs so much as it is about a once-in-a-lifetime event that will be celebrated throughout England - even if it is an event that will fade into the background not long after it happens.\\\n\\\nI'll admit that I do think OP is being an arsehole by forcing his political beliefs on an eight-year-old and excluding her from the whole celebration because of this (kinda going against the whole 'make her own mind up about things' idea) but in the end OP is the parent and gets to make the decision.", "She's 8 and didn't buy it herself. I'd agree with you if the daughter bought the shirt. This was someone else trying to force their ideas.", "This would be like someone giving your child a new-President-of-the-USA t-shirt, if your elections were held every fifty years or so.", "not necessarily. If my 8 year old kid wanted to wear a shirt celebrating a person or party I was deeply against, I'm not sure I'd be down for that. Not at all. They don't have to believe what I believe, but they're 8. There's plenty of time for reasoned discussion down the line. Right now, just pick a non-controversial shirt.", "They're being Monarchs not allowing their child to wear a shirt. Ironic.", "We are not excluding her from any celebrations.\n\nMy parents and their neighbours will be having a street party and we've asked my daughter if she wants to go to it (she does and she will).\n\nThe issue is with the t-shirt.", "I guess OP needs to clarify what the daughter\u2019s opinion is? At 8 she\u2019s old enough to make this type of decision by herself.", "Yes, exactly this. The t-shirt was bought for her.

If I had a young kid that wanted to wear a shirt (cool graphics, nice colors, whatever) and it was against my personal beliefs (and the kid just liked the look, no the \u201cmessage\u201d) I wouldn\u2019t let them, either.
