Still, it was a bit complicated. Also, when I say insisting, I mean it. Maybe she wanted to be alone?\n\nAt last, I went over to my friend, but made sure to tell my sister to keep the door locked, etc etc. Maybe around 2 hours later, I came back home and my mom was angry. She scolded me and asked me why I left my little sister home alone, and was disappointed. I tried explaining and saying that my friend needed me at the moment, but she wasn\u2019t having it and was just angry at me.\n\nI kept trying to explain and stuff, but she wouldn\u2019t really listen and told me I shouldn\u2019t leave my little sister home alone.

Maybe tell her you felt like you'd be a bad friend if you didn't go (if that was true) basically treat your mom as a resource for how to navigate things in the future and that will show that you've been thinking about this carefully and really learning your lesson here \n\nAnd if you've been cold towards your little sis make amends there as well. \n\nFrom my perspective you aren't the asshole for what you did, but you might become one based on how you react going forward.", "Is this a real response?

OP is still a child and will make mistakes. she\u2019s not an AH for the one time she made a bad judgement call. the mother has every right to be upset, and the mother also has a responsibility to get adequate childcare instead of expecting an older sibling to do it. parentification is not okay.
