I always tell my hubby to watch my bag if I go to the toilet or whatever and I never offer him food unless I'm done. I'm not that stupid lol.", "NTA. There was no way you'd know to look. If she told you about it and you then left it, yeah, you'd be an AH, but to pull a cliche, you're not a mind reader.", "Nta.  I always tell my husband if I\u2019m leaving my purse behind so he knows to watch out for it.", "I mean NTA, but generally when I leave an area as the last person I always check for any left behind items. But then I was a scout leader for many years and a group of kids always leaves something behind.", "NTA. I carry a purse and I keep it with me when I get up at public places. It's her responsibility.", "NTA As the woman your bag is your responsibility. She should have told you the bag was there before she left. Proactive my arse, it's not your place to be responsible for her. As for the fries she could have just ordered desert if she changed her mind and was still hungry.\n\nDoes she usually pick tiny fights like this? Because if so I'd really start questioning if being with her is making you happy. Or is she just having a off day and just needs a nap?", "NTA should have hired a bagsitter", "NTA, she didn\u2019t tell you that the bag was there  so it was still her responsibility to take care of it", "Mainly NTA. But dude, you ever look at her? She comes with a bag, leaves without one and all you thank is \"ohhhhh fooooood yeeeeeees foooood\" till you are done and then leave?", "ESH - Why choose to live like this? She left her bag with you, she forgot to tell you, you forgot to look when you got up. Why does it need to be an argument?\n\nWhen I'm out with my family, I make the effort to keep an eye on all our stuff. I check under the seats / tables / whatever to see if someone forgot something. My partner does the same. We're also teaching our kids to do the same as much as possible, simply by asking the question \"Have you got everything\".\n\nOn occasion I forget, or simply don't notice something, usually it works out, sometimes things are lost. \n\nWhat I don't then do is start a screaming row and start blaming everyone. It's a thing that happened. Apologise for your part in it and move on.\n\nYou'll find you end up much happier in the long run.\n\nOr don't, it's your choice.", "ESH, it was her responsibility to keep an eye on her belongings. Kinda your responsibility to double check there is nothing left at the table before you leave it.", "YTA for not noticing something so simple but NTA for the chips\n\nIt's really not hard to be aware of your partners (or companion, not just a partner) belongings, and it goes both ways.\n\nFor example if I go grocery shopping and my gf is carrying the cart and leaves the cart to reach something I'm aware that the bag is there and take it if I wander off the cart why? Because it's expected to be aware of everything about their presence, same as a phone or bag, it's really not too much to ask.\n\nFor all the NTAs are you in an even trusted communicated relationship? \"It's her responsibility\" yikes that hyper individualistic mindset  really is awful to see as if it is the norm/how it should be, be more caring and aware", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not like she manifested it out of thin air while they were eating. It\u2019s her responsibility, but he should also be aware of its existence unless he has the perception of a rock.", "There is a huge difference between leaving your bag at the shopping cart and hiding it under the table.

Ugh, I do not like people who, when they feel embarrassment about their own mistakes, attempt to blame someone else to deflect taking responsibility of their own. That\u2019s exactly what she did. She then decided to keep on the attack by changing what she had said about the food just as another way to push at you. \n\nI\u2019m really hoping this is a one off situation. If this happens with any frequency, she is not someone I would care to be in a relationship with. \n\nIn your shoes, at a soon time when you are both calm and in a good emotional state, I would have a conversation with her and I would express what I believe she did and how that it was neither fair to you nor reasonable. How she responds to that conversation will help you know how to proceed.", "NTA had she mentioned she was leaving the bag it would be your fault. She didn\u2019t warn you, hence one would assume she took it with her.", "NTA, her purse her problem", "NTA.  Girlfriend needs to be in charge of her own bag.

Whenever I go away overnight or on holiday I always \"check the campsite\" before checking out. If I go away with family I remind them to do it but I still chek afterwards. The only time I didn't was because I was standing in my teen's hotel room saying have you looked under... Have you checked in... and watching them do it. They were inconsolable when they realised they'd left their favourite trousers behind. It costs quite a lot to send trousers from Canada to the UK!", "I don't think I'd notice if they spontaneously changed shirts most of the time tbh and I'm a woman. Like it seems obvious if you are specifically paying attention for it, but if you don't think about it, you don't think about it.

A bad guy? A bad partner?\n\nNo. No it doesn't. It makes him a normal person with a limited life experience that is in no way a fault, esp since he's willing to learn. \n\nAnd I've had this happen! There have been a few times I have stepped away from my purse, but so had he. That's my fault. He isn't aware of the risk yet, but I am. Which is why I actively try to TELL HIM when I step away and leave it behind.

And we\u2019re in our 50s and both use purses. I say stuff, because it often includes coats/gloves. It\u2019s just polite to let the other person know where you are going and remind them you are leaving your things behind for a couple of minutes.", "Bro I don't even do that shit as a woman, my purse is always my responsibility unless I say clearly that I'm leaving it. Sure, it's a good habit, but so is taking your damn belongings with you", "Nah! I keep track of my own stuff. If I want my husband to watch it, I ask him to. He's not going to notice whether or not I have a purse and therefore know to look for it. Sometimes, I leave my purse in the car and just put my wallet in my pocket. Sometimes I leave it at home and just bring my wallet and keys. I also have a few different purses that I switch up depending on the situation. Why would he pay attention to any of that?", "He saw her get up without it?? I think it's a wild statement to expect him to notice, 1st that she's wearing a bag, and then 2nd that it's now not on her person. In my experience, noticing things isn't very common among husbands. She holds responsibility here. It's her item, that she chose to leave without. If she needs it monitored, she needs to specifically let him know that he needs to be monitoring it."]}
