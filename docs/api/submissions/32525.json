I\u2019m a woman and I would\u2019ve notified I was leaving my purse with you, if not then the second I saw you get up without my bag I would\u2019ve RUSHED", "NTA. I always tell my hubby to watch my bag if I go to the toilet or whatever and I never offer him food unless I'm done. I'm not that stupid lol.", "NTA. There was no way you'd know to look. If she told you about it and you then left it, yeah, you'd be an AH, but to pull a cliche, you're not a mind reader.", "Nta.  I always tell my husband if I\u2019m leaving my purse behind so he knows to watch out for it.", "I mean NTA, but generally when I leave an area as the last person I always check for any left behind items. But then I was a scout leader for many years and a group of kids always leaves something behind.", "NTA. I carry a purse and I keep it with me when I get up at public places. It's her responsibility.", "NTA As the woman your bag is your responsibility. She should have told you the bag was there before she left. Proactive my arse, it's not your place to be responsible for her. As for the fries she could have just ordered desert if she changed her mind and was still hungry.\n\nDoes she usually pick tiny fights like this? Because if so I'd really start questioning if being with her is making you happy. Or is she just having a off day and just needs a nap?", "NTA should have hired a bagsitter", "NTA, she didn\u2019t tell you that the bag was her so it was still her responsibility", "Mainly NTA. But dude, you ever look at her? She comes with a bag, leaves without one and all you thank is \"ohhhhh fooooood yeeeeeees foooood\" till you are done and then leave?", "ESH - Why choose to live like this? She left her bag with you, she forgot to tell you, you forgot to look when you got up. Why does it need to be an argument?\n\nWhen I'm out with my family, I make the effort to keep an eye on all our stuff. I check under the seats / tables / whatever to see if someone forgot something. My partner does the same. We're also teaching our kids to do the same as much as possible, simply by asking the question \"Have you got everything\".\n\nOn occasion I forget, or simply don't notice something, usually it works out, sometimes things are lost. \n\nWhat I don't then do is start a screaming row and start blaming everyone. It's a thing that happened. Apologise for your part in it and move on.\n\nYou'll find you end up much happier in the long run.\n\nOr don't, it's your choice.", "ESH, it was her responsibility to keep an eye on her belongings. Kinda your responsibility to double check there is nothing left at the table before you leave it.", "YTA for not noticing something so simple but NTA for the chips\n\nIt's really not hard to be aware of your partners (or companion, not just a partner) belongings, and it goes both ways.\n\nFor example if I go grocery shopping and my gf is carrying the cart and leaves the cart to reach something I'm aware that the bag is there and take it if I wander off the cart why? Because it's expected to be aware of everything about their presence, same as a phone or bag, it's really not too much to ask.\n\nFor all the NTAs are you in an even trusted communicated relationship? \"It's her responsibility\" yikes that hyper individualistic mindset  really is awful to see as if it is the norm/how it should be, be more caring and aware", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
