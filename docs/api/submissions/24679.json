Additionally, I have been saving up for a down payment on a house, and lending her the money would significantly lower my chances at getting the home I've been working so hard for.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I explained my situation to her, she became upset and accused me of being selfish and unsupportive. She argued that as her sister, I should be there for her during times of need. She also mentioned that I had helped out our brothers in the past and questioned why I couldn't do the same for her.\r  \n\r  \nI understand that family is important, and I genuinely want to support my sister.
