I'm 16, lightly dressed for indoor temperatures (With the exception of a very warm hoodie), and it's currently Sub-Zero in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. Both of my grandparents came up to me to tell me to help my aunt and uncle shovel their driveway. I told them that I didn't have gloves, warm pants, or a face covering so I'd be very cold since the driveway is about 50 feet long and 7 feet wide, so it'd take probably close to 30-45 minutes to completely shovel. A few minutes later my grandfather basically yelled at me to ask to help them despite them saying \"But it'd be nice\" earlier on. While sitting in the bathroom writing this, he knocked loudly and asked \"Is this your idea of asking to help?\" Before walking away. Despite being 16, i am very weak and tire easily but am commonly referred to as the one in the best physical condition. I'm not saying I couldn't, and I'm not saying it wouldn't be nice, but I'm tired of people expecting me to help out because I'm young even when I'm not equipped to do so. AITA?\n\nEDIT: For some clarification, there's about 4 inches of snow. I did ask for warmer clothing but was just scolded and not given any. Family and physical fitness don't mean anything when it's Sub-Zero and I'm not dressed for the weather.\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you all for your contributions! Although this was clearly more controversial than I anticipated, and there were some pretty mean people, everybody's input means a lot.

In a car, the car could fail and you would still not be properly dressed. Also, it feels like you are not really trying that hard to follow up with getting warmer clothes.

If you leave it and it warms up enough to just start to melt but then gets cold again before you clear it (this is common) - now you have an ice crust on top or worse inches of ice on your driveway and you're not getting it up anytime soon (this is dangerous). Once had a neighbor experience this (like 9 inches of ice) and he tried to sledge hammer it which didn't work. It's better to have driveways clear in the event of an emergency - last thing you need is an ambulance or fire truck unable to reach you, or the gas company in event of a leak, or for you not to be able to leave in a hurry. If you have more than a few inches, you can't just drive the car through it - you HAVE to clear it, and Even with a snowblower and only clearing the essential path that takes time. Even in sub-zero weather many people still have to work. Hospital staff, Nurses, Doctors, firemen, utility linemen, plow drivers, nursing home staff, gas station clerks, all still have to go to work, basically no matter what, for example.

That's his business.\nBut you don't consent to do something you literally cannot safely do. That's your business.", "Thats unfortunate and sad to hear - but yelling at you for not doing something he wants is abusive. I know you probably have  been conditioned to think its normal, but it is absolutly NOT normal to scream at people if they refuse to do something theyre not responsible for.", "Thing is you are used to it and you re prepared for it. \nWhat most people go through now is something they re not experienced with.", "That is horrible advice. This is why so many cities are experiencing deaths in this storm. And in case you missed it, OP specifically stated that they DON'T have enough layers to do that.", "Most people on Reddit are too soft for that kind of talk.", "Same, and then I went to Salt Lake City which is in the 40s. Not bad really.", "We hit the store too for a few essentials but my young kids eat like teenagers\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry to hear about your home. Glad things are going well all things considered. We were lucky with our utilities as well, our tree had me anxious a few times with the wind. Hope things start looking up for you and your family when this is done.", "So\u2026 you mean the OP\u2019s aunt and uncle could have a heart attack shovelling? Wouldn\u2019t it then be better for more people to shovel and finish it faster so any one person would be at less risk? Wouldn\u2019t that be the empathetic thing to do?", "You\u2019re not gonna have a heart attack at 16 shoveling 4\u201d of snow. Honestly.", "Replying \u201cthe US is hella big\u201d to a Canadian is the most American thing possible. The person you were replying to was using the Pacific Southwest as an example.", "Just came here to say, the storm that hit Seattle with ice, hit Colorado with wind and snow and that shit in fact moved onto Chicago and is now hitting Michigan\u2026", "Oh no, their weak frame makes passing out the presents a super taxing job. And they probably weren\u2019t even dressed for it! /s", "If they want his help, then they can give him the clothes. He doesn't need to beg for clothes just to assist them", "The grandpa was being really horrible and when asked for the clothes he didn't even say yes", "Another adult, yay! I was beginning to think there weren\u2019t any on this thread.\n\nHelp your dang family.", "I meant he told me to go ask if I could help. My grandfather had stated he had his own gloves he could lend but didn't give to me", "Agreed", "I asked and was not told", "I am so TOTALLY spoiled for not assuming I'm going to shovel everybody's driveway. Obviously I helped out before and after we ate.", "They are stupid when I'm expected to do it PURELY because of those reasons. If it's provided as a sub-reason, then I'll accept it as long as it isn't an extreme point", "It wasn't screaming it was yelling. He raised his voice above normal levels but not so high that it was unreasonable", "Agree, it\u2019s 4F here (about -16C) and my nephews are running around in 2 hoodies, shorts and crocks.  They honestly don\u2019t own cold weather gear.  It\u2019s a different scenario based on where you are.", "Fair enough, I'm just in a perpetual state of cold from the -45 C and very very bitter right now. Sorry, you're definitely right.", "Thanks fam. We're all good. My mom's friend had a tree fall on her car. Trees give me anxiety lol", "*no one* should be shoveling rn. That's my point. Everyone should be staying indoors.", "Fuck off honestly. It's the cold that kills. But yes anyone could die shoveling if snow is wet enough.", "You mean like those 16 year old football players don't have heart attacks?", "I mean, it\u2019s not a school shooting, but yeah, a pretty American thing.", "Maybe OP is in Michigan but considering he has no warm clothes I\u2019m thinking chances of that are slim\n\nEdit: also just fact checked your claim that system from Seattle is not over Michigan yet it\u2019s Illinois and Kansas city and it\u2019s ending in a half hour", "y'all really are assholes in this comment section, huh?", "His weak fame is made of glass bones and paper skin. Picking up a 2 pound present is going to break his bones.", "Sounds like you didn\u2019t try very hard to get the gloves.  If that\u2019s the case, YTA.    \nAnd the \u201cI\u2019m a guest\u201c excuse is nonsense. Sorry, but in this context, you are family, not a \u201cguest\u201d, and family helps family.  Frankly, friends help friends even if you are technically a \u201cguest\u201d.  Sure, if you were staying at a hotel, it would be a bit much for them to ask you to shovel but, c\u2019mon man, don\u2019t be a putz.", "Oh my God, just go grab his gloves and coat from the door and get out there. And please don't drive if you can't handle snow.", "So what  reasons are there apart from it needs doing and you are there and are capable? Its shovelling snow. What justification would you accept from your grandparents?", "Happy cake day! \n\n-16C? Oh god. I had my fair share (or fare share?) of snow where I live But it hasn't got below -5C. \nGenerally in my country it doesn't get below -10 or -15C? \nNot in the big cities. \n\nPeople tend to forget that most are not experienced or used to extreme weather or even snow for that Matter. \n\nI was watching videos of ppl trying to go outside and I was thinking \"wtf, how stupid are they?!\" Till realization hit me and i was like \"Oh shit that's a first for them. Of course they don't know how dangerous it is, or what to do or how to act\".", "I'm in Detroit, my brother is in Seattle, my sister is Denver and my dad is in Dallas. We all got hit by Elliot. That storm hit everyone. It was ridiculous, but it happened.", "I would accept the justification that i was equipped to do it IF i had been."]}
