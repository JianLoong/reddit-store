It is my life after all and after some reflecting I've realised I've been too soft and empathetic to the detriment of myself and I'm totally done.

What a beautiful culture where you can't grow. Parents should support their children and not suck on them like leeches so the child can't even really live how they want", "NTA\n\nAll of the other adults in your family should go get jobs to support themselves.\n\nIf you give your family financial help in the future, I highly recommend that you give only an amount that you feel comfortable with and instead of giving cash, pay a bill directly.  For instance, get your Mom's landlord information and pay her rent directly to the landlord.  Or pay her electric bill directly.  Don't give anyone cash.", "NTA. Your Mom is an adult. She is an adult who has 33 more years of life experience than you. The fact that she expects/relies on the money *her own son* provides for her is pathetic and abnormal. \n\nHelping a family member out every once and a while is totally chill. Providing financially for your own mother since getting a job is not. Please recognize that you are enabling her by doing this. She has come to expect/feel entitled to your money. She needs to be cut off so that she finally can hold herself accountable for her own financial situation.", "NTA! While it's commendable for people to take care of parents who took care of them, it sounds as if your mother was financially abusing you -- and you morally owe nothing to people who abuse/take advantage of you. \n\nBut check to make sure your country doesn't legally mandate adults to support their parents if necessary, because some places do.", "NTA.\n\nSupporting your parents when they need help is fine. Giving them disposable income to splash around is fine too, as long as there's no misunderstanding.\n\nBut what she's done is lie to you to get you to give her money. That's not OK. If she thought what she was doing was right, she wouldn't have felt the need to lie.\n\nCut her off. If the rest of the family gets on your case, well, they can pay her bills. \n\nIf you absolutely cannot stomach cutting her off, then get her bills redirected to you and pay them directly. \n\nYou are not a free income for her, and as a parent, she owes you more than you owe her. She made the decision to bring you into this world, she owes you an opportunity to succeed in it, not to leech off of you until she croaks.", "NTA\n\n**Honestly, let the entire family consider you the AH.**  You're 33 years old, living abroad and trying to start your own life.  If they consider you the AH, let **them** send tons of extra money to your mom.\n\nIt's great to help someone, but when you're sending so much money to help your mom that you can't even save for a new place, that's too much.  Particularly when she lies to you to get it. Such as saying it's for heating but then wasted on leaflets.\n\nClearly She didn't need the money.  Stop sending her **any** money.  And block the entire family when they all come yelling at you demanding you give her money again.\n\nI have a single mom as well and when I moved out, she **never** asked me for a dime.

Getting a normal job isn't an optio  as she's well over 65.  I have a younger brother but he can't work due to health issues...", "Thank you you're right I know I was just excited at the time and am really close with my brother...he claims he didn't tell my mum anything but rather she read his messages which she has been known to do before... but I've learnt now to keep these things private for sure and to myself", "I've been giving a chunk of my income since I was 18. There was 6 months that i gave nothing cos I travelled but after I got back it was to the same routine\nOtherwise she has gov benefits and dodgy side hustles from her and the other family members", "I've only ever told my brother and that's because he's the closest I have in my family. My dad left when I was 11 and had another family I feel little for them... my brother can't work he has mental health issues so that's why I guess I always funded them both despite knowing the drag and toll it took on.me and my mum can't get a job she is also diagnosed as mentally disabled (sadly can vouch for this)  and also over 65 years old and not to mention am immigrant..which is why I wanted to know if I jus cut them off immediately to go live my life somewhere in Asia ( I have few jobs interviews there) would I be the  AH?", "\"Mom, I'm at a point in my life in which I need more independence and want to focus on my own life, my savings, and be financially free.

This would give you more control over your financial situation overall.", "I see that respecting your tradition is important to you, yet continuing to financially help her is very stressful for you. Maybe instead of just cutting her off completely tell her that you can only help like twice a year (just an example) and give her the choice of what parts of the year would she choose ( for example her birthday month and a specific holiday time).

Sorry.", "Yes I've tried this hell I even moved across continents so I'd only have to give her money and not the other favours I'd do when we lived 10 mins apart.

I'm at the point now where I genuinely want to cut it all of together and just run away...", "I've said this many times and I'd consider myself besides this situation maybe a very assertive person. But it led to guilt trips..threats and just drama etc since I'm the only employed person in the family. I'm wondering to just cut off completely you see and run away to a new country start again..", "Give yourself a break and only talk to her only once a week. If she keeps calling you to guilt trip you don\u2019t answer except for once a week. Is it possible for you to go to counseling to learn how to put up boundaries in your relationship with your mom? Learning ways to set up boundaries is a good thing to know in any type of relationship. Right now stick to your guns and just don\u2019t answer her calls.", "All of those things are just textbook methods for abusers to maintain the status quo. From your perspective, don\u2019t consider it running away, you are taking this opportunity for yourself.", "If she starts that, you need to stop answering her calls and messages. Block her. If she sends other family members to make you feel bad for trying to live your own adult life and meeting your own goals, block them too. \n\nMessage bombing and call bombing is an abuse tactic, just like the poster above said. You are a victim of financial abuse. You didn't choose to be born. Your mom chose to have you. It was her responsibility to take care of you and your siblings. You don't owe her for raising you or sacrificing to do so. Having children was her choice.", "Wow okay thank you I think I needed to read this...and stop living in fear and just go for it..thank you", "And block anyone who harasses you. You mom will probably send others after you, stick to your boundary. You deserve to be treated the way you want in a relationship."]}
