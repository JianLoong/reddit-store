An arms race with the child's mother to win over the child's love with material goods.\n\nYou're right to not want to take part in this.\n\nWhile it's fine if kids' gifts during the holidays are worth more than the gifts for a partner, I would also feel salty about not receiving anything while a 6-year-old receives a $400 shopping spree that she doesn't need.\n\nIf I were you, I would be questioning the future of this relationship.

And if you\u2019re planning on getting married / living together\u2026 Those big things should be discussed. Like \u201cpaying her bill\u201d. I also understand the frustration of not hearing thank you to their dad for all they do. Depending on how long / how your relationship is, maybe you can aid her in understanding the importance of thank you. It\u2019s hard to tell what your relationship is with her and him. But I do understand your frustrations. I\u2019d run personally. It doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re really respected in this relationship and it\u2019s hard enough dating someone with a child who isn\u2019t yours. There needs to be a lot of extra communication, boundaries, and understanding. It takes a lot of work. And it seems like your opinion or place in the blended bunch is entirely respected.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault. It\u2019s the guilt of two parents being \u201cDisney\u201d parents and trying to over compensate for the child having two homes. He\u2019s the one you need to talk to. He can either choose to parent and raise a lovely future adult, or he can choose to spoil and leave the parenting out. You can also choose what you do here too.

Her parents need to stop spoiling her but its not her fault...she is only 6.\n\nNow the most important thing. Your description of the relationship has red flags that you shouldn't ignore. Move on and be happy. He easily set u aside at Christmas,  spent time with an ex and then came back to you?!", "YTA. You should really reflect on how your bitterness towards your BF's daughter (a literal child) is ruining your relationship.", "YTA. You\u2019re obviously jealousy of the money that goes to his daughter. It\u2019s the consistent theme throughout your comment. And he\u2019s not that into you. Sorry.", "ESH. To be honest it sounds like the shopping spree is really just the tip of the iceberg here. You are NTA the asshole for not wanting to go, that's fine. But YTA because it seems like you are jealous of a child here and that is very immature. \n\nAt the end of the day it's his kid and a lot of times when parents divorce or split up whatever they compensate by spoiling the kids because they feel guilty they can't give them the perfect home life they thought they could. That becomes a huge source of guilt for parents (well I am childless - I did experiences this with my parents when they split up as both my mom and my dad have basically never stop kicking themselves for not being able to give me a \"cookie . cutter family\" during my childhood. Which has NEVER bothered me and I respect my parents infinitely for having the self-worth to do what's best for them and teaching me that's okay. But I digress.) and you don't have any room to dictate how they as parents choose to compensate for that. But if the way they're raising THEIR child, doesn't align with how you would want to raise a child then you definitely need to get out of the relationship. Because you'll never be that child's mom and it will never be your place to parent that child. That is NOT what a stepparent is for and that is a sure fire way for you to be resented by the child. \n\nWith all that being said, I definitely think some of the things your bf did, I.e, not wanna exchange Christmas gifts because you were having a rough patch and having his ex girlfriend have him wrap gifts (behind your back), are RED flags and pretty shitty. I think those two things right there are probably two reasons you should really think long and hard about if you want to stay in this relationship or not.", "YTA for being jealous of 6 year old little girl who has parents that want to spoil her.

Both sides have money so she gets it from both sides. \n\nWeve been dating for 9 months and he talks about wanting to have kids with me.

Very concerning.", "I understand the wanting to give the kid the world thing, as a father of a little girl I 1000% do. \n\nBut if you see yourself with this man for a long time, go with the kid for her spree, you\u2019re not her mom but she wanted to invite you. you were important enough to invite. Continue to form a bond with her because if you\u2019re gonna stay you\u2019re gonna be in constant contact with her and be half-parental role model too. \n\nYou have two options, hang up the towel and get out of the relationship. Or you can stick around and try and teach the kid the value of everything she has. The money isn\u2019t going away, but behavior is always changeable.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to do a little more child rearing and teaching, but it\u2019s workable if you\u2019re really in love.", "There's giving a child everything you didn't have, and then there's this.\n\nGiving a child everything you didn't have can mean being able to afford a big ticket holiday or birthday present they asked for, being able to pay for extracurricular activities, being able to go on fun vacations, being able to go to cool summer camps, etc.\n\nGiving a child everything you didn't have does not mean filling a cart with hundreds of dollars worth of random toys that the child probably will barely use. But, I can see how someone who grew up without much might overcorrect and think that this is what to do.\n\nNever hearing the word \"no\" is more of a curse than a blessing. It can, as you've observed, breed entitlement and spoiled behavior. At a minimum, it is worth having a conversation with your boyfriend about what he felt was lacking from his childhood (a person can have a perfectly great childhood without a $400 shopping spree!) and what specifically he wants his daughter to have that he didn't.", "So this guy doesn't sound like has very good judgment on a LOT of issues.  Plus out of all the people he knows/could hire - he picked the woman who his recently broken up with GF had problems with.  That sounds like a petty way to get back at you that ended up getting him robbed. \n\nAlso along with ALL THE TOYS - looking up Baby Burberry - if you have kids with this man would you feel comfortable spending $250-$400 on a casual little dress for YOUR 2 year old that she'd grow out of in 2 months?  Everybody's priorities are different so that might be how things are.   That's another one of those Compatibility& priority issue.  That $400 Target card would get a 6 year old a wardrobe and a bike. $400 at BabyB wouldn't even cover 1of their cotton dresses.", "Did he pay the phone bill before he realised she stole from him? Because honestly this guy sounds like a loser and a bad parent and I\u2019m confused why you would choose to stay with him given the info in your post and comments", "So do you think he brought her back around to upset/ manipulate you?

Regardless if it\u2019s ours or hers. But that\u2019s not the case here. Therefor I think there\u2019s a boundary issue. And I don\u2019t see it as jealousy, you need to be on the same page as your partner in how you want to raise kids if he\u2019s talking about wanting children with you. I see it as reasonable expectations for what you see fit and what you don\u2019t find appropriate. My fianc\u00e9s kids have tons of toys! But not overload. We try to do more experiences with them rather than more toys (they get plenty from all grandparents, extra bonus grandparents, etc.). Toys are quickly disposed of with many kids. Maybe he can spoil her with more experiences? So he feels fulfilled in that area and she gets to experience a diversity of things rather than disposable toys?", "She\u2019s 6 years old.
