We tried 4 different chemo treatments with no luck. The doctors tried getting her into clinical trials but failed there.\n\nShe had gone on hospice care 5 weeks ago. They came to the house everyday for a week, trying to make her as comfortable as possible. She went into their facility 4 weeks ago, staying 4 days while they readjusted her meds.\n\nHer sister and nieces drove in (10 hours) the weekend after she was discharged. The entire time they were in town they never saw how sick she really was.\n\nShe went back into the hospice facility the following weekend. She was in a lot of pain and vomiting. Her parents went to see her multiple times a day from that next Monday until she passed on Friday. After they saw her they would stop by the house to check on me. \n\nI've been physically disabled the last 2 1/2 years. My mom has been staying with us to help take care of me and drive me to all my appointments. My mom had gone back to her home the weekend my wife went to hospice. I had no way of going to see her until my mom returned on Thursday. The ILs never offered to take me to see her while my mom was gone.\n\nI saw my wife on Thursday and again on Friday. A couple hours after we left, she had passed. Her parents had been there in between and taken all her personal belongings. I finally got them back, but can't find her laptop.\n\nThe day before (on Thursday while she was still alive) I got a text from MIL outlining what everyone's responsibilities were. MIL was writing the obituary, my SIL was planning the service (with some pastor I have never met but he had talked with my wife while she was in the hospital and hospice), and I was going to be in charge of paying the funeral home (one the MIL had picked).\n\nI've been busy handling other things so I had my mom talk to the ILs to get the family history for the death certificate and to see if they were going to help pay the funeral home. After that phone call on Monday I received a text from MIL telling me to have my mom stop asking for money. They had none as they want to remember all the things we did together. (Anytime we did something we paid - going out to eat, ball games, putt putt.)\n\nMy ILs believe once she died she's in heaven so they want nothing to do with the ashes. (My wife did say she wanted to be cremated.) I am doubting they even want them at the service. Plus they think since the funeral home isn't helping with the service it shouldn't cost much, and the pastor should be covering that.\n\nAITA for wanting them to help pay for my wife's/their daughter's funeral?

I know I have misdirected my grief and harbored anger towards relatives because it was easier than accepting my parents' death. It just hampers your grieving process. It is understandable.

There is no rush, and YOU, AND YOU ALONE are the legal next of kin for your wife. I suggest you stop all funeral plans for a few weeks. Usually, wherever you wife is being held right now will keep her safe for a few weeks at no charge. Take that time to catch your breath, handle the insurance and life insurance, and remove your wife's medical equipment from the home. There could be a benefit for final expenses and there may also be a benefit for critical illnesses, like cancer. Whe you are ready, pick out an urn, arrange for a cremation and then have a repast at the time and place of your choosing. You don't need a funeral, as you are not interring a body in any form. Funerals are incredibly expensive and no pastor is paying for anything. Your MIL had no concern for you in the last days of your wife's life but she sure is comfortable telling you to pay up. Shut her down, stop the plans, and take some time to process your loss. \n\nI am so, so sorry. NTA.", "NTA!  NTA!!   NTA!!!  \nAs the saying goes ... Did these people just fall off a turnip truck??   \nThey had already started pushing you aside when they never offered to take you to the hospice to see your wife.  \nYour in-laws have no say or control over the rites for your wife. You are legally her next of kin. The decisions are all yours.  \nA cremation doesn't cost much? It's less but still several thousand dollars.   \nIn what world does a pastor pay funeral expenses?", "Nta", "I had to sign paperwork regarding finances/payment BEFORE my late husband could be taken to the funeral home. Whoever signs those forms is on the hook for the funeral costs. I live in the middle of the US, farm country, where some folks still operate on their word and a handshake. I\u2019d imagine there are a lot of people that try to get out of paying for a funeral.", "NTA.  They are not entitled to you paying for what they want. Just plan the actual funeral with the ashes, let people know when and where it is, and let them know when it is. They can have their own separate memorial service if they like,but they need to pay for it.", "NTA. I'm very sorry for your loss. They can pound sand--\"OK, here's the to-do list, OP, you're in charge of paying for everything!\" Wuuut?", "NTA.  The funeral home will require someone to sign a form stating that they will be responsible for payment.  Often they require payment in full before they even schedule the funeral.  Just tell your MIL that you can't afford what they planned and if they choose to continue, they can pay for the services.", "NTA. What they plan for, they pay for.", "Yeah, I would stop that. It happened to me too and my husband died. They basically took over the funeral. I kind of let them.  I didn\u2019t even realize they changed everything until I went to the funeral home. The funeral directors said they had permission from me, but they didn\u2019t.  I figured it was their last hurrah, and I\u2019d never have to see them again, and I never have.", "NTA. Call the funeral director and cancel everything.   He will quickly realize that the family is steamrolling you and him.   Take your time to decide what is best for you to do.", "NTA\n\nLost my wife 8 years ago. Similar circumstances, she had numerous medical issues all stemming from a lifelong battle with Type 1 diabetes. \n\nI planned her services together with her parents, and we split the cost. Except for the burial plots, which they gifted me.", "MIL may have designated you the \u201cofficial payer\u201d but I would first make sure I didn\u2019t agree to that in text or writing and further not sign any paperwork. Let her take you to small claims court some day to try to explain why the funeral she planned and orchestrated without your input should be paid for by someone who didn\u2019t ask for it. These aren\u2019t reasonable people. Don\u2019t argue with crazy.", "ESH. First, I'm so sorry for your loss. Second, I can't imagine parents not wanting to help with expenses for their child's funeral, but Third, and most important: your wife's funeral is your expense. This is EXACTLY why life insurance is so important. My husband and I bought life insurance the minute we were married because who knows what the future will bring. \n\nYou may have not been able to get life insurance because of your disability, but if your wife was healthy, she could've been insured and that money could've made your life a whole lot easier going forward. \n\nBut in the end, don't pay your in-laws if they made all the plans and didn't let you have a say. If you let them make the plans, then you should pay if you can.", "YTA - for expecting them to pay but They are TA for trying to take over the responsibility", "NAH. Sorry for your loss. They\u2019re grieving and might be overstepping but it seems to me you\u2019re just letting them. Take control of the situation from your in laws. However of course you should pay the funeral costs, it\u2019s your wife.", "Did you get life insurance?", "NTA\n\nDid you ASK your IL to take you to see your wife in hospice??  Or were you just waiting for them to offer?? \n\nShop around for cremation.  Some places are stupid expensive.   You can have the remembrance/funeral service at home.   You don't have to pay for a funeral home.   IF they want a funeral home, THEY can pay for it. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.    Sending condolences and healing thought.", "I would inform them that you will NOT be paying for a funeral you didn't authorize..", "If you pay, you make the decisions. If they pay, they make the decisions. I recommend you pay and keep control.", "NTA, talk with the funeral home directly. Tell them that your wife's family made these arrangements without consulting you, you didn't approve them, and you can't afford them. Unless your ILs made the arrangements over the phone and lied about your involvement, you shouldn't be listed as the buyer or responsible party. If you do want to be involved/pay, even a direct cremation (i.e. no services or burial) can be more expensive than you would think. A lot of funeral homes are still small, family-run businesses, and in those cases they might be willing to be flexible on price if you can afford to pay a certain amount. If that isn't the case with this one, then call around and get your wife transferred to another one that you can afford. Additionally, depending on where you live and the amount of debt you've incurred between your wife's illness and your own disability, you might qualify for an indigent cremation or burial fund. You can try looking up if this is available in your area and if you'd qualify, but the funeral home or a local government office should be able to tell you if this is a possibility. \n\nI would also follow up with the pastor to ask about the services he's allegedly providing. Your ILs are making it sound like he's covering a service, but what exactly is he covering? Is it that he'll officiate a memorial service and allow the use of the church without charging you? Or is he just willing to waive the \"clergy honorarium\" that is usually paid to the officiant? You should let him know that your ILs made arrangements without your input or consent and aren't being forthcoming with details. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. The death of a spouse is always going to be incredibly difficult, and it breaks my heart that your ILs are making this difficult time even harder for you.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, OP needs to get the laptop back IMMEDIATELY. There is likely financial information on it that only OP as next of kin should have access to. This whole thing has so many red flags popping up in regards to how an estate is supposed to be handled that you might also want to talk to an attorney if anything is 'amiss' in regards to funds or anything else that might have been on the laptop. I would even go so far as to have a forensic IT person go over the laptop to see if there has been any activity on it that might be problematic.", "Before cancelling, OP should find out what services the in laws agreed to. It may be in line with what OP wants to do. Or OP can just change the services with out incurring the extra cost of moving his wife to another facility. At that point, OP should also make sure the funeral home understands that he is next of kin and to not allow the family to make any more decisions on his behalf, including publishing the obit with out giving him a chance to vet it.", "I paid $1500 for my grandfather\u2019s obit to run in two papers\u2026 8 years ago. \n\nThese things get expensive QUICKLY.", "This.  I don't even think it's legal for them to plan the funeral without your say so.  \n\nI'll be blunt that what they're going through is worse than you, because burying a child is the worst thing that can happen to anyone emotionally - even losing a spouse, with all due respect.  However, you're still her Next-of-Kin whether or not they're happy about it, they're literally stealing from you as everything is yours unless your wife made a will stating otherwise, and you're still the one who lost your life partner.  Their anguish doesn't excuse their bluntly trying to erase you so that they're Next-of-Kin again.", "This is really beautiful \ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd79", "Unless you have lost a spouse and lost a child you can't make that assumption.  \n\nI have lost a child, and it is horrible.  Losing a spouse who is your life partner can also be a tremendous loss.  I would not tell anyone one is worse than the other.  I could not imagine going through life without my partner, which OP now has to do.", "This!", "That's your decision, not theirs", "Thank you. It\u2019s been 17 years this month. I got a cemetery plot for my birthday! We bought hers and the one next to it. \nIt gets better every year. Still hurts, but more bearable.", "I\u2019ve done both. There is no worst.  The untenable piece is when the in-laws activate their family machine to run over the top and the wishes of a grieving spouse.", "Only proving my point further. \n\nNot everyone can do what they \"should\". Most people are barely making it, paycheck to paycheck. Emergency funds and prepaid funerals are only fantasies for most. Get a clue and sit your judgemental ass down."]}
