I have two assistant teachers in the classroom, both middle aged women. \n\nI do a lot of running around and activities with the children, so the center has literally told me to wear athletic clothing to work. I am fine with that. I typically wear a t-shirt and either athletic shorts or joggers. \n\nNow I\u2019m a tall guy (think 6\u20196\u201d) so obviously I have to bend down a lot if I\u2019m working with 3 year olds.

She\u2019ll say stuff like \u201cI see London I see France\u201d and even comment on the colors. She\u2019ll make comments on it not being professional. I want to clarify that my boss has come in to watch me teach many times and has not made any comments. \n\nYesterday my boss pulls me over and says the assistant teacher has made some complaints about my attire. She suggested I wear more \u201cmuted\u201d underwear to work if it\u2019s going to be visible. Not only was it incredibly embarrassing to have to hear my boss talk about my underwear, but doing so would require me to literally go out and buy all new underwear. All my current underwear are pretty bright colors except for one pair of white briefs that I\u2019m not even sure still fit me to be honest.

Turn the genders around what do you think now.\n\nI would imagine and this is just me guessing the Boss is fed up of listening to this woman moan and is trying to solve this using the path of least resistance which she perceives to be you...(Not unusual in education settings teachers and educators don't always make the best managers...great with children not so great at being the boss of adults)....Easier to get you to try to change your underwear than to actually deal with the issue. I am assuming this is is normal underwear and you are not wearing a Chippendale style bedazzled thong or anything.\n\nI think you should be going back to your boss saying that you were taken a back and extremely uncomfortable with the tone conversation yesterday/last week and on reflection  perhaps it would be a good idea to have an HR representative present and maybe even a union representative present for a further meeting....... just let that sit for a minute.....s/he is not going to want to do that I would imagine as this doesn't look good.

Why are they making mountains out of mole hills. My kids go to a very nice upscale daycare and the teachers wear band shirts and have visible tattoos.

I think I'd sooner buy longer T-shirts so peekaboo is less likely.\nOr ask the boss to request the assistant get a flipping life.", "NTA.\n\nHOWEVER I will point out that contrary to a lot of these comments ... this is actually a normal request. Actually, every single dress code I've read in any handbook for any job I've had has made comments on wearing neutral undergarments. Granted I'm in medical, but that should simply drive it home more that it's a professional standard. \n\nThat being said, if it isn't in the handbook, it isn't your issue; and honestly this is very clearly harassment on the coworkers part and you should go to your boss and put in a formal complaint while mentioning that your boss themselves stated they didn't see it as an issue and it is not in the handbook, period. If it isn't in the book, it isn't a rule. It didn't happen if it isn't documented (which applies to the harassment as well which is why you should report.)", "ESH - The way the teachers and boss spoke to you is ridiculous and you could def make a case for harassment. A lot of the NTA comments already address this better so i won't go into it. \n\nHowever, also come on man, you're 22 and have a teaching career. Time to find some longer shirts or pants that fit properly. Underwear accidentally showing sometimes is just part of life but if it's happening every time you bend down... Your clothes maybe just don't fit as well as they could. If someone frequently told me my underwear was showing I'd be embarrassed and want to minimize the chance of that happening. You should be able to wear what you want and be comfortable but within reason... wouldn't it be reasonable to find clothes better suited to your height? Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd find it weird if someone was aware that their underwear kept showing at work and their response was to... be embarrassed but also keep doing it?\n\nEdit: (Pasting an additional note i made in another comment because i want to empathize with people who have a hard time finding well fitting clothes.) I totally get that it's a pain in the ass to shop for specific clothing lengths. I'm a very short person and nothing is ever the right length for me especially pants and sleeve lengths on jackets and tops. I typically have to go out of my way to find petite/short length sizes or else look like I'm drowning in excess fabric.", "NTA, but you said it yourself \"your boss told you\" . So if you ignore the request you may request a raise or promotion that gets the same treatment.", "Yta. Your underwear should not be showing in any professional setting. The problem is your pants. Fix the fit of the pants that you wear to work. Any adult's underwear showing in a daycare setting is inappropriate.", "I mean if it was a female and her thong was riding up her back I think the exact same thing would be happening .. you\u2019re a teacher dude. You work with children\u2026 there should be no reason that your underwear are visible. If you\u2019re bending down  and they are sticking out you either need a belt or you need a longer shirt and the fact there\u2019s people saying this is sexual harassment from the females?!

There's nothing really discriminatory not harassing in this that would help you.  Possibly your co-worker's comments fit into that, but it's very tough to prove and might not hold up.

Lots of horse girls. Lots of Disney girls. Lots of guys who seemed to have diminished mental capacities, or who couldn't deal with the adults in the room.

But if I were regularly showing my bra or underwear, then that might be a problem, even for super casual workplaces.\n\nIt seems like your boss has managed the situation poorly and given you a lot of mixed messages. The dress code is super casual; he likely doesn\u2019t think about the possibility of underwear showing if it\u2019s never happened before, and if he does he assumes you\u2019ll know casual doesn\u2019t include undies. When it becomes clear you actually DON\u2019T intuitively understand that distinction, he doesn\u2019t communicate with you and correct the misunderstanding. Instead, he allows your coworker to treat you poorly and supports that treatment. He then probably feels bad about it, and thinks you\u2019re a good worker and wants to throw you a bone, so he offers this compromise of muted underwear. But that is a weird thing to offer, and boundary-crossing! No one should be commenting on the color of your underwear or, good lord, making RECOMMENDATIONS. It also isn\u2019t a useful compromise, and confuses his original message of \u201cundergarments shouldn\u2019t be seen at work.\u201d\n\nYou mentioned that your boss has seen you work but never commented on this. It\u2019s possible it\u2019s never bothered him and he\u2019s ONLY reacting this way because of your coworker. But, considering his spinelessness, I think it\u2019s quite likely he didn\u2019t approve but also didn\u2019t want to deal with the social discomfort of telling you.  Standard bad boss behavior. I think you need to find some clothes that work for you that won\u2019t show your underwear. It doesn\u2019t matter, whatever you can figure out so your underwear isn\u2019t out on a regular basis. But you should ALSO address the unprofessional handling of the situation, and that you did not get any feedback on this until your coworker had already made rude comments towards you in front of the kids and then gone up the totem pole to boss. The coworker was passive aggressive and the boss was simply passive. This resulted in a situation where you rightly feel very uncomfortable. If your boss can\u2019t handle that conversation well, then you know you have a poor manager for as long as you choose to stay there, and you\u2019ll have to decide what you want to do about that.", "Why cant you wear normal business casual clothes that don't show your underwear?
