I am fine with that. I typically wear a t-shirt and either athletic shorts or joggers. \n\nNow I\u2019m a tall guy (think 6\u20196\u201d) so obviously I have to bend down a lot if I\u2019m working with 3 year olds. Apparently sometimes when I bend down the top of my underwear shows over my shorts and one of my assistant teachers insists on commenting whey time. She\u2019ll say stuff like \u201cI see London I see France\u201d and even comment on the colors. She\u2019ll make comments on it not being professional. I want to clarify that my boss has come in to watch me teach many times and has not made any comments. \n\nYesterday my boss pulls me over and says the assistant teacher has made some complaints about my attire. She suggested I wear more \u201cmuted\u201d underwear to work if it\u2019s going to be visible. Not only was it incredibly embarrassing to have to hear my boss talk about my underwear, but doing so would require me to literally go out and buy all new underwear. All my current underwear are pretty bright colors except for one pair of white briefs that I\u2019m not even sure still fit me to be honest. I want to be clear that the issue is not that my underwear shows maybe once or twice a day (she even admitted that\u2019s a natural part of being bent over so much), but the fact that apparently it\u2019s \u201cattention grabbing.\u201d  This is incredibly embarrassing and I want to know if I\u2019m the AH if I simply ignore it, as all my other feedback has been good and I can\u2019t imagine them firing me over this.", "created_utc": 1674213102, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10guayv/aita_for_not_buying_all_new_underwear_for_work/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

End of discussion.", "NTA\n\nBut there is a bigger issue here..For Context I now volunteer on the governance side in a school and have worked in primary education for decades.\n\nYou are a 22 year old and these colleagues are much older than you. Turn the genders around what do you think now.\n\nI would imagine and this is just me guessing the Boss is fed up of listening to this woman moan and is trying to solve this using the path of least resistance which she perceives to be you...(Not unusual in education settings teachers and educators don't always make the best managers...great with children not so great at being the boss of adults)....Easier to get you to try to change your underwear than to actually deal with the issue. I am assuming this is is normal underwear and you are not wearing a Chippendale style bedazzled thong or anything.\n\nI think you should be going back to your boss saying that you were taken a back and extremely uncomfortable with the tone conversation yesterday/last week and on reflection  perhaps it would be a good idea to have an HR representative present and maybe even a union representative present for a further meeting....... just let that sit for a minute.....s/he is not going to want to do that I would imagine as this doesn't look good. If s/he agrees go with it and set the meeting up.\n\nThen (with HR present or not) calmly  ask your boss why it's appropriate for your much older colleague to make comments about your underwear and ask what their response would be if you were to make comments about a female colleagues. Especially a younger female colleague if you were middle aged man?\n\nExplain that your assistant needs to be focusing on their job not eyeing up the band on your underwear and and this is important \"your backside\" because she is... and her fixation with your undergarments and bottom and her continual comments have made you extremely uncomfortable but you didn't not feel comfortable with rocking the boat. That you should not have to change your undergarments to suit her preference and you wonder if this is a power play on her part as she doesn't like being the junior to a male who is half her age/young enough to be her son/X number of years younger.\n\nThat it is weird that not only have you had to put up with this but management are supporting her in it and if you were a woman this would automatically be considered a sexual harassment issue and you are considering putting in a harassment complaint. \n\nI think you also need to be telling the assistant that her comments about your underwear make you feel \"sexually harassed\" and she needs to stop it or you will be going to HR.", "NTA! Your assistent teach is being really inappropriate. Why is she commenting on your underwear? It is not like you are wearing pants that slack and show your ass. Or that your underwear has vulgar text/images on it. I am sure kids are exposed to colorful clothes regularly.\n\nGo talk to your director about the fact. Ask them what their reaction would be if you were commenting on her underpants or brastraps. She should be repremanding the assistent for staring and commenting about your undergarments.", "I'm going with NTA, because WHY is this pervert looking at your butt and your underwear when you bend over? That's just creepy! If it would help, could you wear longer shirts? Or squat instead of bending?", "What the actual fuck???\n\nSo your co-workers are staring at you bending over to the point they can pick out minute details of your underwear, but *you\u2019re* the filthy perv and the offensive one? Your *co-workers* should be up on workplace harassment.\n\nYour underwear is your choice, not theirs. NTA.", "Hang on. Your coworker says this to you:\n\n>\u201cI see London I see France\u201d and even comment on the colors.\n\nAnd then reports *you*? She's the one being unprofessional, immature, and borderline harassing you.\n\nPoint that out to your boss. NTA", "NTA, I don't think this is an appropriate request on their part. I'd make a complaint about the woman commenting on your underwear, imagine if that was a man commenting on a woman's underwear.", "You need to report her. She's sexually harassing you and you need to report that shit. \n\nThis isn't about your underwear, it's about her being a creep. NTA by a mile.", "NTA. To stop it you could say, I feel sexually harassed when she looks at my underwear and comment on it. If she continues, I'd lodge a formal complaint or talk to a lawyer - even if you have no intention to do so.", "NTA.\n\nAre your pupils distracted by the bright colours? If not then there's no issue.\n\nSounds like the TA is the only person with an issue and really, what business is it of theirs what you wear?", "NTA, you have a tough job as is. Why are they making mountains out of mole hills. My kids go to a very nice upscale daycare and the teachers wear band shirts and have visible tattoos. No one blinks an eye, they are great with the kids and we appreciate what they do. Your assistant is setting a bad examples for treating someone who wears different colors negatively.", "You don\u2019t need new underwear. You need longer t shirts. I\u2019m \u201conly\u201d 6\u20193\u201d and I\u2019ve had this issue too. I order super long t shirts and haven\u2019t had a problem since.", "NTA and the only attention it seems to be grabbing is the assistant teacher, so maybe she\u2019s the problem? Also could you imagine if the roles were reversed and you made that comment about her underwear? Bet it wouldn\u2019t go over well.", "NTA. I agree, it\u2019d be unbelievable for you to be fired over such a minor thing. The obvious sexual harassment aside, there\u2019s nothing inappropriate with what your wear and it\u2019s not like the kids are distracted by it", "NTA but I\u2019m just curious as to what \u201cbright colors\u201d you tend to wear lol", "You could switch to extra long shirts if your underwear is really showing all the time, but NTA.", "Completing inappropriately, you are dressed appropriately and no one should be making such comments. If this unseats they stop listening.\n\n\nThis complaint and issues show double standards, if your were female and assistant teacher was male, this would be seen as sexist behaviour and they would be pull up.", "NTA. I think I'd sooner buy longer T-shirts so peekaboo is less likely.\nOr ask the boss to request the assistant get a flipping life.", "NTA.\n\nHOWEVER I will point out that contrary to a lot of these comments ... this is actually a normal request. Actually, every single dress code I've read in any handbook for any job I've had has made comments on wearing neutral undergarments. Granted I'm in medical, but that should simply drive it home more that it's a professional standard. \n\nThat being said, if it isn't in the handbook, it isn't your issue; and honestly this is very clearly harassment on the coworkers part and you should go to your boss and put in a formal complaint while mentioning that your boss themselves stated they didn't see it as an issue and it is not in the handbook, period. If it isn't in the book, it isn't a rule. It didn't happen if it isn't documented (which applies to the harassment as well which is why you should report.)", "ESH - The way the teachers and boss spoke to you is ridiculous and you could def make a case for harassment. A lot of the NTA comments already address this better so i won't go into it. \n\nHowever, also come on man, you're 22 and have a teaching career. Time to find some longer shirts or pants that fit properly. Underwear accidentally showing sometimes is just part of life but if it's happening every time you bend down... Your clothes maybe just don't fit as well as they could. If someone frequently told me my underwear was showing I'd be embarrassed and want to minimize the chance of that happening. You should be able to wear what you want and be comfortable but within reason... wouldn't it be reasonable to find clothes better suited to your height? Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd find it weird if someone was aware that their underwear kept showing at work and their response was to... be embarrassed but also keep doing it?", "NTA, but you said it yourself \"your boss told you\" . So if you ignore the request you may request a raise or promotion that gets the same treatment.", "Yta. Your underwear should not be showing in any professional setting. The problem is your pants. Fix the fit of the pants that you wear to work. Any adult's underwear showing in a daycare setting is inappropriate.", "I mean if it was a female and her thong was riding up her back I think the exact same thing would be happening .. you\u2019re a teacher dude. You work with children\u2026 there should be no reason that your underwear are visible. If you\u2019re bending down  and they are sticking out you either need a belt or you need a longer shirt and the fact there\u2019s people saying this is sexual harassment from the females?! How about the fact as a grown man that you keep wearing something that you know you shouldn\u2019t be. That\u2019s nasty. Get a belt", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are in the right, but you are not in a good position to fight it.  Most states are at-will employment, so you can get fired for any reason, so long as it's not discrimination.  There's nothing really discriminatory not harassing in this that would help you.  Possibly your co-worker's comments fit into that, but it's very tough to prove and might not hold up. So, if this is your hill to die on, you need to start looking for another job now because fighting this could cost you the job.  \n\nUnderwear aren't terribly expensive.  You can grab some tighty whiteys and move on from this.  \n\nYou're still in the right, but you're also in the awkward position of not really being able to fight your way out without suffering consequences.", "NTA.

This teaching assistant is the one who is creating the idea in these kids' heads that underwear is somehow bad.\n\nI went to school with a lot of elementary education majors, and it was amazing how many of them acted as if the only way to teach kids was to reduce their own mental capacity to that of the kids they were supposed to be teaching. Lots of horse girls. Lots of Disney girls. Lots of guys who seemed to have diminished mental capacities, or who couldn't deal with the adults in the room. Many of them would make those stupid kids' jokes like \"I see London, I see France\" in a faux-patronizing tone and think it made a valid point to other adults. It doesn't.", "NTA.

Her commenting on your underwear was her way of telling you about the issue and expecting you to do something about it, but the thing is it\u2019s her issue, not yours.

Easy - Just tell the boss IN WRITING that her bx is harassment and you want to make a formal complaint.  Point out that, if the genders were reversed, there would not have even been a question.

No, it\u2019s not ok for your coworker to comment about your underwear that\u2019s only visible when you bend down, a very normal thing for everyone.
