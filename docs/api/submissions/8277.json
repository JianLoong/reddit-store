When I picked him up, he was very emotional and not in a good way. He said that when he came in the classroom, there were cards on his desk from his classmates and the teacher brought up to tell him that they all loved him.\n\nShe had no business doing that and I called her out on it.

She wouldn't so I went straight to the VP and asked him to switch my son into the other 4th grade class. \n\nHe asked me for a week and then asked me and my son what our thoughts were. I said this is way too much drama for my son and I don't care if she wants to turn a new page. My son isn't attached to her. My son said he wanted a new class.\n\nHe explained that the teacher was wrong, I overreacted and switching classes reflects poorly on a teacher but he didn't want blood bad in the class.

You're grieving yourself, so regardless of how you phrased things, they should really be giving you a bit of patience at this time. \n\nI also don't think what the teacher did to begin with is all that crazy. I think many people wouldn't consider the passing of a parent to be private information. It's something very obvious that is clearly going to affect your son. \n\nIt was ill considered to put your son on the spot without consulting you about the best way to support him, but it came from a place of compassion.

Her biggest and most telling mistake, in my mind, was reacting so defensively when confronted. If her intentions were pure and not purely performative then she would have been mortified to realize she made the situation worse, not better. \n\nGood for you, Dad, for putting your own grief on hold and doing whatever it took to make your son feel comfortable and supported.\n\nI am truly sorry for your loss.", "Absolutely not. Zero percent.\n\nRegardless of the initial intention, regardless of whether some would say it's fine, or kind, or \"supportive\", you told the teacher in no uncertain terms that you didn't appreciate what she had done, and that it has hurt more than helped your child in his grieving process.\n\nThere is one single correct response to that: an apology.

Really surprising that the administration would side with teacher. That's workplace 101. \n\nI N F O Did the teacher actually reveal any information?

The default is its confidential, not \"you may tell every person in the community and publish it publicly\".\n\nYou can't prefix everything with \"What I am about to say is a secret, with the exact definition of you may not ...\"", "Yeah I get what you\u2019re saying, I just don\u2019t agree. Teachers are actually TAUGHT not to share out info about kids. The default should be, in my opinion, not to share. It was a thoughtful idea and she could have reached out and asked if it would be okay to give cards on return.  She\u2019s a teacher - she should know that different kids have different reactions. I think she really went against what she should really know and then made it worse by not owning it. Again, my opinion. Not that I\u2019m saying my opinion is worth more than I jar of pickles but my husband is currently a teacher and I was 23 years in education so the opinion is from a different angles for me. I realize you have your own experiences that lead to your opinion and that\u2019s great. This is just one we don\u2019t share. I\u2019m sure we agree on other things. Have a great day!", "Saying something as vague as *trouble at home* would lead to too much speculation. Teacher shouldn't have divulged personal information about a student without the parent's consent which they didn't have.", "Right, shes not a mind reader - maybe she should have asked first - instead of...trying to read minds.", "That's really not okay. Especially to do to a kid. It's hard on an adult but it's so much for young kids.", "Wow. I\u2019m so sorry you and your son went through that. That had to be so traumatizing. I really wish you and your family healing in your time of grief.", "*That* he died isn't the same as *why* he died.  The teacher overstepped, yes, I'm not defending it, but at the same time, I can understand why she did it.  The info (again *that* not *why*) is likely to get out eventually, and your anger feels a little over the top... but also understandable.\n\nStill, I'm sorry for your loss, and hope you and your son have a lot of support around you.", "The teacher controlled the info getting out to frame it in a way of support rather than a secret behind his back. Seems like the appropriate thing to do for an adult", "FERPA protects the right to privacy of educational records - grades. Not relevant to this situation. Good try tho", "And how exactly is she supposed to stop all innocent comments or what not? I recently went through this with my son, and no, it isn't the teacher's business necessarily. It's personal preference how one would approach the situation. The only thing the teacher NEEDS to know is that they're is a situation keeping the child from attending class at that moment.", "Look at you, getting emotional lol. It takes two people to argue. So if you don\u2019t like what I am saying, then leave me alone. \n\nTeacher does not have to know every single thing that is going on in a child\u2019s home. At worst, the parent could\u2019ve said \u201cplease don\u2019t mention the child\u2019s dad as that is a sensitive situation right now.\u201c\n\nYou\u2019re just mad because you didn\u2019t convince me. How narcissistic are you?", "I had a child suddenly drop dead and I had to take care of all kinds of details, including funeral arrangements and notifying my job and the like. \n\nIf she is so traumatized by the grief, then she shouldn\u2019t have the emotional space to be upset about something like this.", "I agree; but that wasn\u2019t the discussion of this thread. The discussion was whether or not the teacher should\u2019ve kept it a secret. And honestly, fuck the OP. Why should the teacher apologize? She did nothing wrong.", "Why do they have to know things that are secret? Yes, you have to preface everything you don\u2019t want someone to share with that statement.\n\nThis is not any type of a patient-doctor confidentiality.\u201d\n\nThe default is \u201cthis information is free to share unless I\u2019m told otherwise.\u201c", "If this goes against typical teacher protocol, I feel like this is something you would\u2019ve led with rather than saving it for your \u201clast word\u201d comment.", "Teachers can speculate all they want. Certainly there are other phrases that would suffice if that\u2019s your only concern. Something like \u201cpersonal situation.\u201d \u201cDifficult time at home.\u201c Whatever. Teacher does not need the exact details. In fact, they don\u2019t need to know anything. This information goes to the attendance office.\n\nThey could even say he\u2019s not feeling well. Or that he\u2019s having some anxiety up or he\u2019s just uncomfortable at school and just needs to take a few days off. \n\nThere are a dozen things she could\u2019ve told the teacher. Irrespective of all of that, she should\u2019ve made sure that the teacher kept it a secret if that\u2019s what she wanted. The teacher is not a mind reader.", "Why should she ask? If you share something, you\u2019re giving that person permission to tell other people.", "Teacher did NOT have permission to share that information. That\u2019s NOT adult. The teacher is very wrong to have done this, this was not their information to share. \n\nIF the teacher had come to OP and asked if it would be okay, then that would be one thing. At least then they could have discussed if it would be appropriate or not. Doing it without discussing it with OP is wrong.", "FERPA protects all school information down to what's being taught in class. Good try though.", "Sorry that happened to you but people process grief differently. I don't think it's unfair to say that a person grieving has the right to make a minor judgment error", "I\u2019m sorry it was interpreted that way - as a last word. I just didn\u2019t want anyone to think this was pulled from thin air for me. And frankly, even if they aren\u2019t TAUGHT about confidentiality, I would still expect them to keep quiet as a default.", "But why? I think having the students write sympathy cards was a very kind thing. It\u2019s absolutely on the bearer of the information to dictate the parameters of that information."]}
