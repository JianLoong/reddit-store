She wouldn't so I went straight to the VP and asked him to switch my son into the other 4th grade class. \n\nHe asked me for a week and then asked me and my son what our thoughts were.

You're grieving yourself, so regardless of how you phrased things, they should really be giving you a bit of patience at this time. \n\nI also don't think what the teacher did to begin with is all that crazy. I think many people wouldn't consider the passing of a parent to be private information. It's something very obvious that is clearly going to affect your son. \n\nIt was ill considered to put your son on the spot without consulting you about the best way to support him, but it came from a place of compassion.

Her biggest and most telling mistake, in my mind, was reacting so defensively when confronted. If her intentions were pure and not purely performative then she would have been mortified to realize she made the situation worse, not better. \n\nGood for you, Dad, for putting your own grief on hold and doing whatever it took to make your son feel comfortable and supported.\n\nI am truly sorry for your loss.", "Absolutely not. Zero percent.\n\nRegardless of the initial intention, regardless of whether some would say it's fine, or kind, or \"supportive\", you told the teacher in no uncertain terms that you didn't appreciate what she had done, and that it has hurt more than helped your child in his grieving process.\n\nThere is one single correct response to that: an apology.

Really surprising that the administration would side with teacher. That's workplace 101. \n\nI N F O Did the teacher actually reveal any information?

I was actually grateful when I returned to school that everyone knew because it saved me a lot of awkward conversations explaining why my dad wasn't around the rest of elementary school.
