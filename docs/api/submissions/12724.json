You can always ask her:\n\n\u201cCan you remind me again why we are in this situation: me, being the driver and you, being the passenger?\u201d", "NTA. I don't think you ought to continue chauffeuring her; she seems likely to continue hectoring you until your car is in the shop too. Perhaps there's a 2-for-1 offer of which she plans to take advantage. You've been doing her a great many favors by driving her to and fro, and she has responded with abuse and invective. She's not entitled to your assistance.", "NTA. If you're getting rides because you caused an accident and can't currently drive, don't make comments when someone is helping you out.", "NTA. I CANNOT stand a backseat driver, especially one who has no idea what tf they\u2019re doing. She needs to get her act together before she kills someone.", "INFO - was she the one who rear-ended you while texting?", "NTA  Tell her if she doesn't like the way you drive she's welcome to find another ride.", "Nta backseat drivers are so annoying especially when they\u2019re the passenger because of their poor driving. Good on you for calling her out", "NTA - Backseat driving is rude, especially as you\u2019ve declined her \u201cadvice\u201d several times she should read the room and knock it off. You could\u2019ve been more direct asking her to stop. She should not be pushing you to drive outside of your comfort zone period, but especially as she\u2019s the one who made herself run late to class. Lastly, as others have said, her track record is poor and she\u2019s in no position to tell you how to drive.", "NTA.\nIf she's going to complain about your driving as you're doing her a favor, then she can find someone else to drive her. End of story.\n\nDoes she even acknowledge that her car being in the shop is her own fault?", "NTA - I mean, assuming your history of her is accurate, you're not wrong and she's the last person who should be giving advice on how to drive. \n\nTruth hurts, I suppose.", "NTA - not only is her advice terrible and her track record is questionable, back seat drivers are the worst. As long as you aren\u2019t also a terrible driver having someone question your judgement when you drive is how you get into accidents. It cases you to second guess yourself and make bad calls. \n\nBut also if you\u2019re going to back seat drive at least have it be someone who is overly cautious and not someone who is trying to get you to break traffic laws.", "NTA.

Clearly she hasn\u2019t learned from her accidents yet.", "just stop driving her and drop her off at a bus stop next time she complains", "NTA. She\u2019s a menace. I would tell her that the next time she gives you driving advice, that will be the last ride she gets from you. And then stick to it. She has a choice, she can be grateful that you\u2019re chauffeuring her around and STFU or she can figure out her own rides.", "NTA. By about the 2nd or 3rd time (max) I'd have told her to get someone else to drive her places or take the bus, Uber, etc.", "NTA. Stop giving her rides if she continues to back seat drive. You're not a chauffeur, and you're doing her a favor. She sounds obnoxious and ungrateful.", "NTA, even if she was a better driver - backseat drivers are annoying and make people drive worse than they usually do.\n\nConstructive criticism may be ok, but not until you are parked.", "NTA and I would no longer be driving her around. She\u2019s gonna cause another accident because she\u2019s stressing you out.

OH WAIT, SHE CAN\u2019T.\n\nOne final warning before you no longer give her rides.", "NTA but you should advise her to be an Uber driver for the lulz", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
