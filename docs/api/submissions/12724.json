I don't think you ought to continue chauffeuring her; she seems likely to continue hectoring you until your car is in the shop too. Perhaps there's a 2-for-1 offer of which she plans to take advantage. You've been doing her a great many favors by driving her to and fro, and she has responded with abuse and invective. She's not entitled to your assistance.", "NTA. If you're getting rides because you caused an accident and can't currently drive, don't make comments when someone is helping you out.", "NTA. I CANNOT stand a backseat driver, especially one who has no idea what tf they\u2019re doing. She needs to get her act together before she kills someone.", "INFO - was she the one who rear-ended you while texting?", "NTA  Tell her if she doesn't like the way you drive she's welcome to find another ride.", "Nta backseat drivers are so annoying especially when they\u2019re the passenger because of their poor driving. Good on you for calling her out", "NTA - Backseat driving is rude, especially as you\u2019ve declined her \u201cadvice\u201d several times she should read the room and knock it off. You could\u2019ve been more direct asking her to stop. She should not be pushing you to drive outside of your comfort zone period, but especially as she\u2019s the one who made herself run late to class.

As long as you aren\u2019t also a terrible driver having someone question your judgement when you drive is how you get into accidents.

Yes, her unsolicited advice on how to drive is dreadful.  Running stop signs!  The only reason why she hasn\u2019t killed somebody yet is down to luck, not judgment.
