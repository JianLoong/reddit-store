Stop driving this crazy person around, and pray she doesn't get her car back anytime soon for fear she might kill someone.", "NTA stop giving her rides", ">  was rear ended by some chick \n\nTotal AH just for that - YTA. N T A for the story, but you are winning no friends.", "NTA. In high school I was the first of my friend group to get into an accident that left a huge smash/dent in my door (my na\u00efvet\u00e9 for thinking all drivers actually use their blinkers); my car and door still worked afterwards. Anyway, I was constantly harassed daily by my \u201cfriends\u201d about my car, and then rumors spread that I was the one causing dents in other peoples cars in the parking lot! Anyway, EVERY single \u201cfriend\u201d that taunted me about my door being smashed literally TOTALED their car within the next 365 days. \n\nYeah they didn\u2019t appreciate getting called out for their mistakes, wonder why \ud83e\udd14", "NTA stop driving her around", "My go to line is always \"You're starting to look a lot like a pedestrian.\"", "It's the worst. My mother has me drive her car when we go anywhere and she backseat drives and causes so much stress. I've started tuning her out. I know it's her own anxiety and panic, but it triggers my own anxiety and then I can fuck up. Who knew that yelling at a driver would stress them out.", "[deleted]", "Funny my 3 1/2 year old daughter does the same thing. I told my wife I have a backseat driver to deal with now.", "Weird flex but OK.", "The reason they're late is probably because she's going about her usual routine, figuring that red lights and stop sign can be ignored to make up the time. She needs to know that just because she's willing to be an unsafe driver doesn't mean everyone else should have to conform to that.", "Some chick?! Why not just say a woman or a young girl hit him, calling women chicks seems disrespectful imo.", "Nta. People like that kill people all the time and they are the ones that walk away from the accident", "NTA. Well I guess she can drive herself and the way she wants when her car is out of the shop after the way she drove it.", "Nta, not sure why you're putting up with it at this point. If they are such good drivers according to them, they shouldn't need a ride, let them uber or get a rental", "NTA!", "NTA she wouldn't be in this situation if she was such a good driver", "NTA. \n\nTell her, \"If you can't stop giving me shoddy driving advice, you can start paying me taxi fare, call an Uber, or take the bus until your car is fixed. How much was your deductible, again?\"", "\u201c she might not have rear-ended me while texting, \u201c but she was definitely a PITA! \ud83d\ude09", "My son started being an apprentice backseat driver at 2-ish.\n\nFirst thing he learned? What to call other drivers that nearly cause crashes. That became one of his first words, when he heard someone honking because they had been blocked in the parking spot: \"a-holll\" (our language equivalent or so)", "Exactly! And even if it weren\u2019t entertaining (bc I think kids can be fun as hell, but understandably not always especially when they constantly ask questions) we\u2019re talking about a literal 6 year old with a natural sense of curiosity and desire to LEARN. Not whatever OP\u2019s friend is\u2014 just a whole adult refusing to drive safe and outright instructing OP does otherwise\u2026", "100%\n\nPeople like her are why accidents happen. \n\nDriving is not hard. There are a lot of rules but if you follow them and focus on your surroundings there are not many reasons for accidents (unless it's something caused by weather or a freak accident)\n\nBut on a normal day there is no excuse. It infuriates me when I see people driving like idiots and not paying attention.", "My guy chick is not derogatory holy hell. Maybe back in the 80s or something you could use that argument but nowadays it's just informal slang like dude. Hell I refer to myself as a chick occasionally, or even chica which is spanish and where it originated I'm pretty sure. Y'all gotta stop calling everything bigoted. You sound like the people that correct me for calling myself black \"uhm it's african american\" headasses", "\"chick\" is just slang for woman. I am a women. Chick is not offensive. Same as dude is not offensive.\n\nI get that we live in an age where everyone gets offended by everything, but calling someone a chick is fine.", "Weather and freak accidents are still caused by failure of someone or something not following the rules of the road.", "You know what? You're right. \n\nPiss pouring rain? Slow down. Remember not to slam breaks hard.\n\nSnowing? Same applies.\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is there is no real excuse for accidents to happen. Don't be an idiot driver.", "Exactly. The laws of physics are static, and we must abide by them. I live in a heavy wintry state. I slow down because with ice and snow, friction changes so I need to plan for longer and slower direction and speed changes.", "And headlights. My state has a law stating that if your wipers are on, your headlights have to be on. And yet, every time it rains, I see dozens of cars without headlights on in pre-dawn. In the evening, same thing. Black, gray, and silver cars are the WORST about it, and I cannot count the number of accidents I've passed where the car in question was A) Speeding (as in passed me going way too fast for conditions), B) had no consideration for conditions, and/or C) had their phone to their face (illegal in my state).", "NTA. This is just something bad drivers seem to feel the need to do. My ex brother-in-law was on his second or 3rd DUI. He needed to be driven to his AA meetings that were part of court ordered treatment. This was in 1997. At that time, the highway we had to travel on was still 55 mph (it\u2019s since changed to 65 mph). It being a 4 lane road, I was driving 60 mph. I was asked to take him to and from his meetings. He looked over and saw me driving 5 miles over and told me it was a dumb reason to get a ticket. I was so flabbergasted that I didn\u2019t say anything but I kept thinking \u201cyou\u2019re lecturing me about going over the speed limit by 5 miles while I am taking you to AA because of getting another DUI\u201d! To this day I just can\u2019t wrap my head around his bitching at me!  I never have had a DUI and the highway speed limit was changed a month later. He eventually got his criminal justice degree and became a reservation cop-then lost the job for getting another DUI!", "NTA Don't drive her anywhere any more. Problem solved.", "Excellent. Now you don't need to drive her around. Your car. Your driving. Her loss.\n\nNTA", "NTA - stop driving her.", "NTA, I've had to drive someone like this. Tells me I'm too cautious, I need to be more confident,  drive faster, only check mirrors to look for cops, then goes on to tell me about all the insanely dangerous crashes that they somehow managed to survive and were mostly their fault.", "You are NTA but she definitely is. Guess she can walk from now on or find someone else to drive her since she doesn't like your driving anyway. How does she even have a driver's license anymore with three at fault accidents in 6 years? If those are the accidents, there were probably tickets that were not accident related as well.", "NTA. I work for a company who has 4 employees. We have been open for 2 and half years. They have gone through 4 different trucks and 2 of the current one have been in the shop for accidents. Anytime they bring up my driving like a \"grandpa\" I always ask what number truck they are cause I've been in mine since we opened.", "I also refer to myself as a chick sometimes. And other women as well. But nevertheless, it can be seen as a derogatory term given the context, and in this context, it's meant to be derisive and derogatory. The person who caused the accident while texting could have been male or female, their gender has nothing to do with it. There was absolutely no need to add in \"some chick\" to this story, except to point out the person in question seemed to be female presenting. I did not say that it is always derogatory, but context matters.\n\nDo I find it to be a big enough issue to deem the OP an AH? No. Someone else did, though, and when someone questioned how that was a problem, I simply tried to explain. You don't find it offensive in this context. Great.\n\nETA, only because you mentioned that you think it originated from \"chica,\" I looked up the origins when I first responded, just out of curiosity. I didn't find a definitive origin, but saw an opinion that it originated from Britain, when they would refer to women as \"birds,\" and a \"chick\" to mean a young woman. I googled it again just now out of curiosity, and Google is telling me it was first coined in the Jazz community in the 1920s. Which is interesting. No idea if it's true, since it's the internet and all."]}
