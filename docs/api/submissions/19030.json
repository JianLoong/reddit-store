But yeah.. whatever happens I hope you find a solution everyone is happy with.", "NAH. Deep cleaning and reworking recipes takes a lot of work and is expensive, so I understand why they're trying to recoup their costs. Of course you should have a meal you can eat at your wedding! Are there any caterers nearby who specialise in allergies? My thoughts are that you could make contact and see if they can supply you a single meal. Ugh. What a horror for you. I hope it works out!", "NAH.\n\nWanting a meal provided for you that you can actually eat at your wedding is totally reasonable, and the kind of thing that does make sense to spend some extra on.\n\nThat said, catering is extremely expensive, and adding on 25% to the catering cost in order to avoid cross contamination while also providing a modified, sauceless beef to the guests is a pretty big ask and it's reasonable to be concerned about the financial impact of that move.\n\nWhat I will say is that if it's your wedding, sitting down to eat the meal is usually not something you have a lot of time to do; things stay pretty busy. So eating something you can survive on for the night pre-wedding is a reasonable call regardless.", "Info: Is it too late to find a venue that can cater to your dietary restrictions? Was this not something discussed before you booked it?", "Part of my job is organising large corporate events, and a solution we use (London, UK) for allergies (and certain religious requirements) is to have a specialist caterer deliver meals\u2026 they are delivered at a set time, sealed and given to the guests sealed too - might be worth exploring with your venue? \n\nThe bigger issue, is the level of your allergies - are you going to be affected by the allergens simply being in the room?", "NAH\n\nWanting to eat the food at your own wedding is very reasonable. \n\nBalking at an 25% increase in cost and suggesting a single meal be brought for you is also very reasonable.\n\nYou'll just have to talk it through and see where you land on the issue.", "I\u2019m actually going to go with YTA. You didn\u2019t do your due diligence and now want to spend $1000+ just for your plate. Can\u2019t you do what your sister did and order in from somewhere?", "Nah\n\nBut I think you are both idiots for not getting this sorted before paying non refundable money.", "NAH\n\nbut this should have, and could have, been taken care of before time ran out.", "Info: did you discuss this with venues before picking one? It seems like a pretty major factor when choosing where to have your wedding", "That\u2019s 25% extra for the entire service, for one plate. I guess you just have to ask yourself if you would ever pay that much at a restaurant for your individual meal, whatever the amount is. I think the problem is whether all of the venue food options can be made without things like milk, egg, and some spices, while still being tasty enough for your guests.", "NAH. You both have a point.", "NAH\n\nFrom your point of view, it's understandable that you want to be able to enjoy a meal at your own wedding without having to worry about your allergies. It's a special occasion, and you deserve to have a memorable dining experience. You've already been accommodating by considering the options provided by the venue and exploring the possibility of having the kitchen take extra precautions to ensure your safety.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, your fianc\u00e9's concern about saving money is also valid. Weddings can be expensive, and it's natural to look for ways to cut costs. Bringing your own food could be a practical solution, especially if it saves a significant amount of money.\n\nYou both need to come to an agreement.", "A 25% increase in food costs is a *huge* amount to pay for one person's allergy, even if it is the bride's (or groom's). I mean, that would be *hundreds* of dollars. (I'm estimating $30/plate for 100 guests = $3000, 25% of which is $750. If either of those numbers are higher, it could be thousands\u2014$50/plate for 200 guests = $10,000, 25% of which is $2,500)!\n\nYou really want to spend an extra $750 (or $2,500) *for a single meal*?!\n\nJust have your favorite restaurant or a separate caterer provide a single meal of something you can eat. It can be as fancy as you like; I assure you it won't cost as much as $750.\n\nOn the other hand, is it too late to pick a different venue that can more easily accommodate your allergy? If your allergies are so severe, I'm not sure why you chose this one to begin with.", "NAH\n\nIt's your wedding too, you should be able to enjoy it. I don't know your money situation, but considering the average wedding costs $29,000 apparently, an extra 25% is significant and I'm not surprised your fiancee is concerned. It is worth $1,000 (or whatever) to you to have one plate of food? If it is, go crazy!", "NAH\n\nOfcourse you want to have a meal you can eat at your own wedding, and not bring your own food. Isn\u2019t it possible to ask another caterer who has the experience with food allergens ro prepare your meal?", "NAH - I can see it from both sides and allergies are not something to treat casually as they can very quickly become massive medical emergencies (Hopefully your aren't so bad!).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIs there a 3rd party caterer that might be of more use that could use the locations facilities? Might be worth considering and checking, they might very well be more accomodating to menu changes vs the reception locations where they probably have a set list of a few menus to reduce changes their staff need to include from function to function (Otherwise each event would end up with entirely bespoke menus which would be a lot of variances!).", "INFO: What is the actual increase in cost? Is that increase worth the cost of a single meal?\n\nI'm going to guess this is a genuine NAH - it's very reasonable for you to want a meal you can safely eat, but it's also reasonable to look for alternatives if it means your meal would end up costing thousands of dollars extra.\n\nPersonally, I think I would most agree with your fianc\u00e9, but in no way does that make you an AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Have you asked the venue if they can arrange to have a meal made at a third party site and brought in to be served at the same time as the rest? At your expense, which obviously would be expensive, but likely far, far less than adding 25% to the entire food bill.", "Often caterers will out source special meals,  kosher for example.  Have them look into a place that specializes in tricky allergies or if you know of one, have them prepare your meal.", "NAH - You require an unusual level of service from the venue. The venue wants to charge extra for that level of service. Your fiancee is proposing an alternative.\n\nNobody is being an asshole. Everyone is stating their needs and their requirements and looking to have a pleasant wedding.", "This sounds a bit crazy but could you incorporate a food van, in my city there are many that specifically cater to allergies and you could perhaps have them do a course and meals for you and coffees or some thing at the end of the night. And I mean a fancy food van, not like a hotdog. \ud83d\ude01 Then you are getting fresh food that is made by people who understand how to not only give you safe food but for it also to be tasty.", "The problem is that you've booked and deposited on a venue that can't or won't cater to your needs without a ridiculous upcharge to prevent cross contamination. It's 2023, and cross contam procedures are bloody common (at least where I am.) \n\nIf you weren't discussing your allergies with each venue's interview process, then it's on you and your fiance - and somehow, I suspect that is the case, and that your fiance had the initial discussions. I find myself wondering just how seriously your fiance takes your allergies, and hope it's just my read of the narrative.\n\nNAH, but leaning towards your fiance being TA, and disgusted by the venue for its archaic views.", "NTA \n\nWe had people with allergens at our wedding, so we made everything gluten-free and catered to vegans to.cover off vegetarians too. \n\nCan you not ask them to make you a special meal that covers you off? You're paying enough for food, surely they should be able to accommodate you?", "Of course you should be allowed to eat a meal at your wedding which you didn't have to bring yourself.\n\nCan't you change venue? \n\nNTA.", "I was really on the fence when you listed all the things you are allergic to- that is a LOT (but you know that). Then it sunk in- that IS a lot, and you have to deal with workarounds all the time in your life. Surely on this one special day, it's worth it to pay the extra 25% so you can just party and have fun without thinking about it FOR ONCE. NTA- tell your lovely fianc\u00e9 it can be her wedding gift to you.", "NTA it's your wedding, you shouldn't be forced to watch everyone else happily eating while you have an empty plate", "NTA", "NTA you should be able to eat at your own wedding. if its too expensive to buy from the venue, you can bring your own food or ask your guests to bring one meal you can eat each", "It's YOUR WEDDING. If you need to serve plain rice and baby applesauce cups so that you don't get sick, everyone else can suck it. \n\nIdk about your allergies but mine are severe enough that a hug or kiss or sharing a drink with someone who has had an allergen puts me at risk. Are you going to sit in a bubble all night? \n\nNTA. This is a hill to die on, so that you don't literally die", "If they require 25% extra service fee to actually have a clean kitchen? They\u2019re the problem.", "NTA for wanting to have the one meal.  However, you would be TA if you go through with it for the 25% markup.  Just bring something with you and then you can use the saved money to do something special with your wife on your honeymoon that you can remember.  People don't remember the food as their first though on the reception, it's the bigger picture, individuals and such.", "This should have been the very first question brought up with the venue. NTA to want food you can eat but poor planning on your part.", "NTA. However, since you are allergic to so many ingredients, I would have food for yourself catered from a KNOWN safe kitchen. Even if the venue has the kitchen deep cleaned, all it takes is one new-hire kitchen staff person who in snacking on peanut-butter crackers to mess up your entire wedding. For your safety, get your food from a proven reliable source.", "NTA. \n\nI understand your allergies are more broad than mine, but I do have Celiac. My wedding last May was Celiac safe. All food was GF and the desserts were as well. \n\nthis is not too much to ask. Also, food and entertainment are two things people remember about weddings.

Only you and your fianc\u00e9 can decide which is best to prioritize.", "Echoing the NAH.\n\nFellow Celiac and oof this hit me right in the feels. As frustrated as I'd be by it, I'd bring my own food purely so I know the risk of me getting sick on my own wedding day is minimal to none. Can you compromise with your SO and say you'll provide your own meal but the cake absolutely has to be allergen free?\n\nI get your pain though OP.

They needs to do the financially responsible thing and cater in his own meal.\n\nEdit:  fixed for originally mixing up the bride and groom in my response.", "Orginal price was going to be about 4,500 with the fee increase it will be around 5,600. So a 1000 dollar jump", "It sounds like you arranged this at the time of the booking. Allergens are genuinely difficult to avoid in a kitchen setting and a restaurant becomes liable if they say something is allergy free and someone reacts.", "Already booked and it is really nice.

Most people have thankfully learnt by now to only ever buy things specifically labelled as gluten free.", ">milkin\n\nNot sure about the jurisdiction for OP of course but I can confirm that the liability laws for allergy stuff like this are pretty damn strict in the UK, and for something as large as a wedding venue the extra efforts it would take to deep-clean everything to prevent any cross-contamination of allergens is quite a bit of extra effort. Considering just how hard a company here could get sued for something like that, I can understand the 25% price increase as it involves more than just reworking the recipe(s).\n\nIt really sucks and it's unfair (in a 'life is unfair' kind of sense) for OP, but from a legal perspective it's understandable.", "I would say it's fair. Restaurants have all kinds of allergens all through them *all the time*\n\nA venue has a responsibility if they say they're doing something allergen free to actually deliver. If they say it is and the patron reacts - they're liable for that. \n\nAs a person with allergies I can assure you that cross contamination occurs very easily too. I can't eat at other people's homes unless I bring my own stuff - as even cookware that's had gluten would set me off.\n\nA restaurant would have to deep clean everything to try and get rid of all traces of allergens. It's completely fair they mark it up a lot when the people coming have the much easier option available to bring in something safe themselves. A restaurant is not obligated to undergo that level of effort without being paid.", "I'm already married.\n\nSaving money for our future seems like a pretty good trade off for me ordering a meal for myself tbh. We have way better things to throw $1000 at.", "Why didn't you inquire about allergy issues before putting money down?", "I think OP is the male and the reasonable party aka the fianc\u00e9e is a woman.", "Wouldn't it be cheaper to just have the food you want made elsewhere? You could splurge and get your favorite dishes. Seems like a weird power play on your part not to.", "That could have definitely been worse, but still....ouch. \n\nI've got to stick with NAH. I cannot blame you one bit for preferring to pay it as part of the cost of the wedding, but I can also see your fianc\u00e9's hesitation at that price tag.", "Sorting the food took ages and wasn't settled until a few weeks before. Wasn't hard for them to change a few things, but it did increase the cost. But we felt that was a small price to pay for not having anyone dying at the wedding or leaving with the shits!", "Worst case, you could ask the venue if you can have a meal delivered to them (sealed to avoid contamination) which they serve alongside the rest of the food? Then you order from somewhere else.", "oh mb NAH. both sides make sense, perhaps you can pay the additional fee with your own money if you care a lot about it", "The thing is, even with their best efforts there is still a risk of cross contamination. It's probably best for you to just bring something you know without a doubt is safe than end up in the ER on your wedding day just because you want to be stubborn.", "Yeah I think people don't realise how difficult it is to remove allergens completely for stuff like this. It's way, way more than just altering a recipe and you're absolutely right that the restaurant becomes liable as soon as it confirms it can provide allergy safe dining.", "Yeah this is on me, I really didn\u2019t think it would be that big of a deal since my sister got married and she didn\u2019t have much problems. Think back on her wedding I think she ordered food for herself", "Whoops you are correct!", "OP does have a longggg list of allergies though. \n\nIt's super cool that they catered to you so easily!

They were prepared at a kosher kitchen and came frozen and sealed. We heated them up, and served the sealed container on top of a plate directly to the guest so they could open it. I don\u2019t know what they did about flatware now that I think about it. Wasn\u2019t the best option, but at least they got to eat something", "It's SO much more than altering a recipe, it's insane. Having worked in restaurants myself, I ONLY trust restaurants with separate allergen stations specifically designed to accommodate my Celiac now. I've seen way too much in those kitchens to trust the cooks to know how to keep me safe, and honestly, it's not their fault- they aren't well trained for these protocols!", "Then that's what you need to do."]}
