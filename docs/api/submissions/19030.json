But yeah.. whatever happens I hope you find a solution everyone is happy with.", "NAH. Deep cleaning and reworking recipes takes a lot of work and is expensive, so I understand why they're trying to recoup their costs. Of course you should have a meal you can eat at your wedding! Are there any caterers nearby who specialise in allergies? My thoughts are that you could make contact and see if they can supply you a single meal. Ugh. What a horror for you. I hope it works out!", "NAH.\n\nWanting a meal provided for you that you can actually eat at your wedding is totally reasonable, and the kind of thing that does make sense to spend some extra on.\n\nThat said, catering is extremely expensive, and adding on 25% to the catering cost in order to avoid cross contamination while also providing a modified, sauceless beef to the guests is a pretty big ask and it's reasonable to be concerned about the financial impact of that move.\n\nWhat I will say is that if it's your wedding, sitting down to eat the meal is usually not something you have a lot of time to do; things stay pretty busy. So eating something you can survive on for the night pre-wedding is a reasonable call regardless.", "Info: Is it too late to find a venue that can cater to your dietary restrictions?

I guess you just have to ask yourself if you would ever pay that much at a restaurant for your individual meal, whatever the amount is.

You both have a point.", "NAH\n\nFrom your point of view, it's understandable that you want to be able to enjoy a meal at your own wedding without having to worry about your allergies. It's a special occasion, and you deserve to have a memorable dining experience. You've already been accommodating by considering the options provided by the venue and exploring the possibility of having the kitchen take extra precautions to ensure your safety.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, your fianc\u00e9's concern about saving money is also valid. Weddings can be expensive, and it's natural to look for ways to cut costs. Bringing your own food could be a practical solution, especially if it saves a significant amount of money.\n\nYou both need to come to an agreement.", "A 25% increase in food costs is a *huge* amount to pay for one person's allergy, even if it is the bride's (or groom's). I mean, that would be *hundreds* of dollars. (I'm estimating $30/plate for 100 guests = $3000, 25% of which is $750. If either of those numbers are higher, it could be thousands\u2014$50/plate for 200 guests = $10,000, 25% of which is $2,500)!\n\nYou really want to spend an extra $750 (or $2,500) *for a single meal*?!\n\nJust have your favorite restaurant or a separate caterer provide a single meal of something you can eat. It can be as fancy as you like; I assure you it won't cost as much as $750.\n\nOn the other hand, is it too late to pick a different venue that can more easily accommodate your allergy? If your allergies are so severe, I'm not sure why you chose this one to begin with.", "NAH\n\nIt's your wedding too, you should be able to enjoy it. I don't know your money situation, but considering the average wedding costs $29,000 apparently, an extra 25% is significant and I'm not surprised your fiancee is concerned. It is worth $1,000 (or whatever) to you to have one plate of food? If it is, go crazy!", "NAH\n\nOfcourse you want to have a meal you can eat at your own wedding, and not bring your own food. Isn\u2019t it possible to ask another caterer who has the experience with food allergens ro prepare your meal?", "NAH - I can see it from both sides and allergies are not something to treat casually as they can very quickly become massive medical emergencies (Hopefully your aren't so bad!).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIs there a 3rd party caterer that might be of more use that could use the locations facilities? Might be worth considering and checking, they might very well be more accomodating to menu changes vs the reception locations where they probably have a set list of a few menus to reduce changes their staff need to include from function to function (Otherwise each event would end up with entirely bespoke menus which would be a lot of variances!).", "INFO: What is the actual increase in cost? Is that increase worth the cost of a single meal?\n\nI'm going to guess this is a genuine NAH - it's very reasonable for you to want a meal you can safely eat, but it's also reasonable to look for alternatives if it means your meal would end up costing thousands of dollars extra.\n\nPersonally, I think I would most agree with your fianc\u00e9, but in no way does that make you an AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Have you asked the venue if they can arrange to have a meal made at a third party site and brought in to be served at the same time as the rest? At your expense, which obviously would be expensive, but likely far, far less than adding 25% to the entire food bill.", "Often caterers will out source special meals,  kosher for example.

The venue wants to charge extra for that level of service. Your fiancee is proposing an alternative.\n\nNobody is being an asshole. Everyone is stating their needs and their requirements and looking to have a pleasant wedding.", "This sounds a bit crazy but could you incorporate a food van, in my city there are many that specifically cater to allergies and you could perhaps have them do a course and meals for you and coffees or some thing at the end of the night. And I mean a fancy food van, not like a hotdog. \ud83d\ude01 Then you are getting fresh food that is made by people who understand how to not only give you safe food but for it also to be tasty.", "The problem is that you've booked and deposited on a venue that can't or won't cater to your needs without a ridiculous upcharge to prevent cross contamination. It's 2023, and cross contam procedures are bloody common (at least where I am.)\n\nIf you weren't discussing your allergies with each venue's interview process, then it's on you and your fiance - and somehow, I suspect that is the case, and that your fiance had the initial discussions.

People are constantly coming up to the table to say hi, take pictures, etc. There\u2019s various dancing opportunities, and my wife and I also snuck outside to do a few nighttime photos with the photographer. The silver lining is that everyone else complimented the food I didn\u2019t get to eat. \n\nAnyways, your wedding might be different. If it is, go for the food you want to eat. If you think it will be like the situation I described above, grab a snack once the wedding is over, so an after party at a restaurant or bar you trust, etc. My night ended at 3am in the Carls Jr. drive thru.", "INFO are the venue happy for you to have something catered from another supplier? Either just for you or for everyone?", "Are you allowed to bring your own food in? I thought that was a liability thing too?", "NAH.  How much is the 25% more? That actually makes a huge difference to me, that could be $10k more or $1k more. Either way, I completely understand where you're coming from, but I see your side too.  Does she have a plan for how to actually seamlessly have food brought in for you that isn't you pulling out a tupperware container?  What does she envision as the solution to this?", "I'm going with soft YTA.  So you want to pay 25% more for everybody, just so you can eat the same meal as everyone else, and might still have problems?  If money is no object, they go for it.  But that seems a silly way to spend money if you have other options. I would place an order with a restaurant and have someone from the bridal party go pick it up just before meals are served.  I'm sure the venue would be OK with something like that vs having issues with you getting deathly ill.", "NAH.\n\nIdk if you cook, but reworking and testing recipes when you have a list of allergens is expensive and time consuming work, especially if you're allergic to core ingredients that are the basis of every recipe I cook. Slightly different cook times because of ingredient swaps, needing to change out techniques because one needs an ingredient that is an allergen to make an impact, etc, means that all the recipes need a new trial run. And that's just with me, a home cook at thanksgiving navigating gluten free/soy free/dairy free/onion free/10 veggies and herbs free cooking, I'm not a business that needs a profit.\n\nIt would have been better to book a venue without a contract for food and beverage and then seek out an allergen-specialized catering company to bring in your food if you wanted everyone to eat the same thing rather than expecting a current business to adapt everything they make for average weddings without an increase in cost to you.\n\nIf money matters, it likely would be cheaper to hire a personal chef that specializes in allergen sensitive cooking than make allergen-sensitive meals for everyone. The last time I hired a personal chef for a date night, it was like $50/hr plus the cost of groceries for our meal. They could likely closely mirror what the catering kitchen menu is, but at the cost of only recipe developing and feeding you vs sanitizing and making everything allergen free for the whole wedding.", "NAH. Couldn't you have a fancy restaurant DD or UE a really nice meal? I get the problem, really, I do -- it's your wedding too! -- but there's just so many factors, including financial and food safety, that this might be the best option.", "NAH\nYou do have a lot of allergies and I\u2019m afraid you will run into this same scenario even if you go with a different venue. Let\u2019s say you do pay the 25% up charge. Are you and your fianc\u00e9 willing to cut the budget somewhere else? And if you are, do you really trust that there will be absolutely no cross contamination? Are you prepared to risk having an allergic reaction on your wedding day? Really it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interests to bring food you know you can eat.", "NTA. I understand where your fiancee is coming from but it's your special day too. I can't imagine bringing my own home cooked food to my wedding while everyone else gets nice food I've paid for. It's a one off, just pay the extra 25%.", "NAH\n\nI can understand wanting to have a meal you can eat at your own wedding but do you really want to pay 25% more for everything just so you can have a plate ot two of food? It just doesn't make any financial sense. If I  was in your situation I would just bring my own food like normal.", "Of you're allergic to everything, why would you trust any food that you didn't make yourself?  So you'd rather spend thousand more on good instead of just bring a sandwich or something?\n\nYTA", "NTA - I don\u2019t know but I feel like if the place I\u2019m having my wedding reception can\u2019t make sure that I (the person paying) am able to eat, I need to go elsewhere for my reception. Their only compromise is to not feed you? I don\u2019t like that.", "NAH\n\nBoth of you have very reasonable points. AND it was on you for not checking before putting the money down.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't take the 25% increase options for two main reasons:\n\n1) way too much money that can be used for something else (not saying the charge is unreasonable tho)\n\n2) I wouldn't trust that they REALLY can make all the meals allergy free, I wouldn't risk it tbh, specially with so much money and my health on the line\n\nI would go for the food in option. Cheaper, no risk for health AND it could be something special for you, and even both of you, different from the rest of the guests. You still would eat at your wedding, being that the main issue here. Win win", "I really empathize with your situation, but given the current staffing crisis in the hospitality industry, I wouldn't trust them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I would bring my own food because although that is annoying, it is not as bad as having an allergic reaction on your wedding day and ending up in the hospital.", "YTA Shelling out an extra grand and possibly changing the entire menu just so one person (regardless of who they are) can eat maybe three bites of food is an asshole move. I\u2019m sorry you have so many allergies but because there are so many you should have done your due diligence way before you even agreed on a caterer. Order food from your favorite safe restaurant and save that extra grand for an actually needed expense.", "INFO: Is this the only vendor available? Your list of allergies isn't that \"crazy\" to make a menu around. \nAnd your NTA for wanting to enjoy the wedding menu either.", "NAH but depending on what exactly you\u2019re allergic to and what dishes they serve, it might not actually be really reworking the dishes so much as a compromise. She is going to need to live with your allergens for the rest of your life. She needs to learn how to cope with them now. The answer of well just bring one in when it\u2019s both of your special day is NOT the answer. The caterer should be able to accommodate without something crazy as 25% more. 10% I can see. 25% is a cash grab. If you can name of several dishes that are allergy friendly for you and possibly provide them allergy friendly recipe as a starting point for them, that should be sufficient to start. It\u2019s a give and take situation when there\u2019s a lot. We do this all the time with a 150 student marching band and staff. It isn\u2019t that hard to accommodate.", "I think what your fianc\u00e9 says makes a lot of sense. Listen, you\u2019re genetically jacked up and have all these problems. It\u2019s not your fault,  but it is what it is. Weddings are already wildly expensive and having an additional 25% price when you\u2019re the only one who needs it?\n\nCome on. You have to know he\u2019s right.", "YTA no one is saying you can't have a meal at your wedding", "NTA. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask to be able to eat at your own wedding reception.  I honestly would think about changing venues to someplace that can accommodate you.  The kitchen should be able to accommodate you without the up-charge.", "This situation could have been avoided if you had been extremely clear up front before booking the venue that you have these food allergies. It's not your fault you have all those allergies, but sorry to say it IS your fault that you went ahead with a booking without clarifying that first. If I had that many dietary restrictions, the food would be the first thing that factored into any decision making about the venue.\n\nHowever, that is hindsight which we all know is a wonderful thing, I guess there's not much you can do about it now. I don't think you're the asshole here just a little na\u00efve, but I do think since you've really brought this situation on yourself, you should compromise and go with the option to bring food in.", "NAH\n\nPersonally I wouldn't pay an upcharge of 25% but would just have an absolutely fabulous meal delivered.\n\n Whether the charge is reasonable doesn't matter. I would imagine the restaurant actually doesn't want to do it and so is hoping that you don't actually have them do it.\n\nHonestly you are probably not going to even enjoy any food at your own wedding because you are not going to have a leisurely time to enjoy your food. \n\nIf it makes you feel better take the 25% you are saving by NOT having the kitchen decontaminated and spend it on something splurge worthy - whether it is something just for you like beautiful jewelry or something for you as a couple like an enhanced vacation, for me it would be money better spent than on essentially a meal that you won't really enjoy anyway.", "Like others have said and you admit, very poor planning.\n\nFor some reason people become so emotional or go into some hormone induced mentality - common sence goes out the window.\n\nThink about the insane extra cost to cater for your needs, why? I can understand it's a wedding but there are other compromise you can do which will make your experience so much better and you would be laughing about it in the future going through the videos and pictures with friends and families. \n\nThe compromise is to organise your favourite food, gourmet food, seafood etc that you can eat and have it delivered at the right time, it will make everyone else jealous and you have saved yourself \n$$$thousands which you can now spend extra on your wife to be hoping she forgives you \ud83d\ude01\n\nLook OP I don't want to say you are TA as it will make you sad, since it's a very important day to you I will say NTA hope that makes you \ud83e\udd23\n\nGo hug your fiancee and tell them they are right, give her a big kiss and show her this reddit post of yours.\n\nGood luck", "NTA you want to be safe and enjoy your own wedding it\u2019s a day about you and your fianc\u00e9 you should be able to eat what everybody else is eating", "NTA\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9e was the allergic one then this would not even be an argument.\n\nTell her to save money on her dress and see what she says.", "Adding to this, myself, as well many others I've heard online, barely ate at my wedding. You're so busy and happy with everything the last thing you want to is sit at your table and be forced to eat. I think I had one or two nibbles before running off to say hello to everyone.\n\nNo judgement but if you want my opinion don't waste 25% of the entire cost on one meal you're going to forget about. Don't have nothing, but see if you can organise a pre packaged meal to quickly scoff down without focusing too much on it. I know it sucks but I can promise you the meal you eat isn't the highlight of the wedding.", "Very much this. I understand OP's frustration, but also understand the kitchen and fiance's points.\n\nPerhaps there is a compromise where someone you trust makes a nice meal for you in a safe kitchen, and the venue still does the plating and serving? That way you all save some money but you still get the stress-free experience of having a lovely meal you don't have to cook yourself served to you. Or even just have something catered from a 'safe' restaurant for yourself with the same process. You deserve a nice meal on yout special day.", "Maybe something brought in catered from somewhere fancy so it\u2019s at least equivalent quality to the wedding food? OP deserves a fancy restaurant quality meal for once and it\u2019s worth spending on that (even if it\u2019s a few hundred dollars for one meal).", "Oh absolutely.  Those wedding sharks will charge you 25% to 200% more and not change a thing", "Their fiancee thinks they should eat leftovers at their own wedding, how the fuck is that not an asshole move?", "Yes! I wonder if another caterer could mimic the other dishes for OP, but make it without the allergens. That way, no cross-contamination (minus other people\u2019s plates around OP) and they can all enjoy the same meal.", "I am basically all the food allergies in a trenchcoat of a human and I was going to say NAH because not being able to eat the same as other people and \u2018break bread\u2019 or have the \u2018wedding breakfast\u2019 that joins you together at auspicious times is really pyschologically impactful. For many people 25% \u2018not missing out\u2019 tax is worth it at important occasions. (I rarely eat out but will often eat just the bread basket while paying full price to make up for using a seat and causing staff more work for example.)\n\nBut then I read OP did not do any research, due diligence or check his own allergies before the deposits were paid and time is tight and I\u2019m going YTA. Because it is up to the allergic person to do as much checking as possible before asking waitstaff, kitchens, friends, family or radically altering the budget of your whole damn wedding and impacting the bride.\n\nI actually share some of his allergies and as they are not in the \u2018major 14\u2019 category under EU rules there is no way he has tried to eat anything without having to check for garlic because at this point it\u2019s in desserts it\u2019s such a common ingredient and utter nightmare to be allergic to. I work with food and asking for the deep clean, rewritten recipes and apparently serving no sauce to guests is a trifecta of \u2018are you fucking kidding me?\u2019 requests at this stage.\n\nI suspect the 25% includes asshole tax since he did not book the caterers with the info upfront and has given them a hella difficult last minute bait and switch. He needs to pack his own meal because this is a nightmare for the caterers and his other co-host, the bride who will have to spend her wedding explaining why there is no sauce and discussing allergies and generally since people get very passionate about sauce, all the guests muttering about dry meat. (I despise condiments and anything that makes food \u2018wet\u2019 and this blows people\u2019s minds more that the allergies.)\n\nHe\u2019s basically derailing his own reception to every one else\u2019s impact because he didn\u2019t check at all at the start. I would be absolutely livid with my partner if they did this at any major event let alone our wedding. My partner would absolutely tell me to pack a meal and like it if I pulled the same stunt. If they didn\u2019t rethink marrying me for such an AH move. My partner double checks to tag team me on allergies but if I have made zero effort to not almost kill myself, I get zero sympathy. \n\nI also constantly have to host meals I cannot actually eat because no one else willingly eats as much completely bland chicken and rice as me.

This is more like, they have to remove all of his allergens from everywhere in the building, like the refrigerators for example, and then deep clean the fridge. They wouldn't normally deep clean the fridge between every wedding. Now extrapolate that to the ovens, cabinets, etc. It's a lot of labor.", "Not that simple. There is cleaning then there is guaranteeing that a tiny amount of garlic plus a long list of other allergens are not present. The fridge needs to be emptied and sanitized so anything with an allergen can't cross contaminate, that requires a separate fridge or wasting ingredients in it.

Gluten is fine\u2026 gluten free usually means they used soy, rice or a nut flour.  Or \u201cI made it vegan for you\u201d means they used nut milk or soy milk or similar. \n\nOur solution is to bring food just about everywhere.

Weddings can be so expensive already without adding the additional expense of a 25% increase of catering costs to feed everyone food that has to be so carefully prepared for you to be able to eat it. Would an acceptable compromise for you guys be to have it catered without any restrictions, but pay the extra to have the catering company, or maybe someone else, make a nice meal just for you? That way, you aren't bringing a picnic lunch to your wedding, but you aren't having to spend a whole bunch extra on allergen free food that most of your guests don't need to be able to eat safely. \n\nMy sibling has celiac and a few other sensitivites, and that was what they did. Sibling had a separate portion of food that was guaranteed safe for them, and they had a separate cake for them to cut and eat that was gf, instead of paying to feed 200+ people gf cake. It meant that sibling couldn't eat wedding leftovers, but they decided that was better than nearly doubling their food costs.", "Honestly you're NTA but if I were you I'd bring my own food. \n\nFirst, you can guarantee it will be safe and it will be cheaper. \n\nSecond, even \"good\" wedding food is usually nothing to write home about.

I not only got my meal free, but I got a small tour of the kitchen to look at everything and see if I could find any other errors. The manager admitted that they were doing it as a commercially viable business due to attractiveness and the ability to charge more for a niche market. I left after an amazing dinner that I luckily didn't get sick from and what seems like sincere assurances that's some more education would be done around food and staffing.

Just ask any bride or groom!!!", "NTA. It's your wedding, and you deserve to eat an enjoyable meal without stress. Just pay the 25% extra.", "NAH. Given how the economy is I get where your fianc\u00e9 is coming from. But as someone who has a pretty severe peanut allergy, I know how difficult it can be to accommodate sometimes. Honestly coming from someone with an allergy, take this opportunity to get yourself a yummy, allergen-free meal that you love and don\u2019t get a lot! You can still celebrate and have it be allergen free, this is the perfect time to have something you maybe don\u2019t normally get", "NAH: I\u2019m planning my wedding now and 25% more for catering would be around $5,000. Which does seem a little extreme. I\u2019d much rather being in food and save $4,900 for something else. So I can\u2019t fault your fianc\u00e9. But I can\u2019t imagine how frustrating it is for you\u2026 :(", "If your fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to do this for your wedding, your future looks short.  Expect to start seeing some of these food show up in the house as time passes because it's too much of an inconvenience to do without.  NTA.", "YTA. Bring your own food or pick a different caterer that can accommodate your allergies.", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding as well\u2026not just hers. Should be special for you too.", "Raising a kid with celiac here. I have been teaching him since he was diagnosed at 5 to always be assertive and watch out for himself. I do it for know but I want to make sure he can do it on his own when needed. From the time he could read we have taught him to always read ingredients, looking out not just for wheat but also barley and malt. Now he also knows to look up on line anything new just to make sure. When something states gluten free it\u2019s great to see, unfortunately some times it will also state \u201c produced on equipment that also produces wheat\u2026) so we have learned to check everything and help him learn to make informed decisions about what \u201cchances\u201d he is willing to take and what not. BTW to those in the US, GF Soy sauce and Soy milk can be found very easily and there are also GF donuts which at least can be found in the biggest supermarket chains I\u2019m not sure if I am allowed to write brand names here so if anyone is interested and google it, u can DM me.", "Right? I would honestly prefer to bring my own *especially* to an important event. Imagine getting hospitalized on your wedding day. So not worth the risk", "I mean the desire doesn't make someone an AH. I agree it's a ridiculous request though. I would honestly be more inclined to bring something on a special day cause getting sick on my wedding day would suck", "In my experience in restaurants the risk with allergens outweighs anything else", "> I designed my own compliant menu and had the caterers bid it out.\n\nSo you did the correct thing. OP did not. If OP had been organised they would have realised this is not an option for this particular company.", "Honestly getting whatever you want delivered from a fancy restaurant will be SIGNIFICANTLY better than whatever wedding catered, cold ass, underwhelming food they serve", "Very common depending on where you are. Chill.", "Right? One thing all guests will discuss after the wedding is the quality of the food. I would bring my own meal rather than pay more to serve my guests senior citizen Vegas buffet quality food at my wedding.", "I run an asian tapas (izakaya ish) restaurant. I just use gluten free soy, buy it 18L at a time.\n\nAnd our deep fried stuff is karaage style, rice & potato flour\n\nThe joy on the faces of the lil celiacs when they ask if there is anything they can eat & I tell them it's nearly everything except one sauce.... that's good shit :D\n\nSaving the world one allergic human at a time, fighting that good fight.", "Perhaps, but it sounds like it\u2019s a venue that makes you use their in house food. You would think they would be a little more upfront about \u201cit\u2019s literally impossible for us to accommodate food allergies,\u201d which also seems totally bizarre for an event venue.", "Definitely will be cheaper than the 25% upcharge, too, since that would cover all the catered plates.", "Oh man.. people who don't call ahead and expect to be catered for are just idiots.\n\nWe've also had customers a few times who say they can't have gluten **at** the table. The chefs freak out and sort something and then we see them eating a bite of their friends garlic bread or something. 'ohhhh I just don't really like how bloated it makes me' \n\nSoooo enraging. There is literally no need to be overly careful for idiots who just don't like it. For allergies we need a whole ass seperate dining experience. People are so dumb", "It's unreal how many people don't realise which ingredients contain gluten. You really have to be *so* careful. I have a friend who is gluten free by choice rather than having celiac and early in our friendship I used to trust her saying things were gluten free and was glutened twice and had to explain to her that I'd gotten sick. Once when she swore some lollies she purchased were gluten free and another time when she purchased hot chips and I got super ill. She hadn't even realised that chips made in the same oil as gluten would make me sick.", "omg yes.. and oh and those **'MAY CONTAIN GLUTEN** are so disappointing. You know it's just cross contamination but it's not worth the risk lol. Such disappointment.", "Omg my local sushi place uses GF soy sauce and potato starch too and I love them so much :')\n\nYou are truly doing angel work hahaha. You are wonderful. For real. You must have some loyal ass customers. Us celiacs keep lists of places like yours lol.", "Everyone is always weirdly shocked by icecream particularly.. it's a thickener in so much. Things like icecream people often but for me thinking 'oh it's just dairy' haha. Not so!", "Heyyyy I have IBS and lactose intolerance too. I feel her pain so much.\n\nI always say I would probably be so much heavier if I didn't have these issues lol. I am thin by force haha. I want to eat so many foods but too much sugar, oil etc will set off my IBS. On top of this I also have a chronic illness that affects my heart and if I overeat I'm bedridden so I'm literally forced to be skinny cause my dumb body can't just enjoy things lmao.", "Same haha I frequently feed everyone haha even when we visit other people :P", "No I ate more than the nachos haha. I'm saying only the nachos stick out in my memory because it was a massive pregnancy craving and my dad sorted it out as a surprise.", "I had a chef once say something in relation to guests with allergies sitting down and realising most stuff is 'not for them' which stuck with me, he said \"imagine the disappointment\". \n\nI love feeding people kickass food, the idea of one person on a table getting a lesser dish, and that they are always having that experience when they go out.... nah not on my watch.\n\nEvery trainee that comes through my door gets those words repeated, and I show them my special freezer drawer & dry store stash of 'allergy shit'. We can replace any item on any dish in 15 minutes, for any allergy. As it should be.\n\nI have an often changing 8 course tasting menu, we always have an allergen free replacement for every dish, and it's printed off & stuck to a wall so all the servers can learn it & put our guests at ease that they're in safe hands.\n\nIt's not hard once you plan for it. Sadly my industry is overworked, and underpaid, and there is on average a strong pushback to taking on the extra work to do it this way.", "NAH.\n\nBut honestly, I see bringing you own food and saving money as a win-win.  Because, A, Saving money is always good, and B. It's the only way you can be ABSOLUTELY positive your meal is safe to eat.", "I\u2019m sorry you are having a hard time with this.  Is there an outside caterer that can make your meal in a different kitchen and bring it in? I know some people use separate caterer\u2019s to incorporate  specialty foods\u2026\n\nPerhaps hire someone to make a table side \u201callergen-free\u201d a-La-cart hor d\u2019oevres \u2014-(which I have seen at many weddings) and they can prepare your allergen free dinner at their table-side setup.", "I have just about the same allergies you listed.. haha! I can feel the hives coming before it hits. I have a love/hate relationship with food. I totally get what you mean. Best of everything to you", "You should totally just order the regular menu for guests and order a special meal from outside for just you or both you and your wife. Because 1. it will cost more money for you to get the same food as everyone else 2. There's still a chance for contamination and who wants to deal with that at their wedding?", "Use the extra 25 percent you would have spent and hire a private chef for you or a food truck \u2705\n\nLike you could get the best meal delivered and they would have to eat crappy wedding facility catered food \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NAH. I have Celiac\u2019s and for a long time I couldn\u2019t eat a wide variety of foods because of it. I get where you\u2019re coming from, I really do. This is sad. Food allergies come with loss, grief, and isolation. People who don\u2019t get it, don\u2019t get it, and I agree your fianc\u00e9 is lacking empathy here. However, the money is not the actual point here. \n\nPay for a separate meal to be made and brought in. You do not want *this* amount of stress over one meal, and I promise you the kitchen will find more ways to make this stressful before this is over. They will likely still expose you, you will end up sick AF on your wedding day, and then they will victim-blame you and insist they told you that you shouldn\u2019t do this. They will likely make you sign a waiver that would compete with a mortgage in terms of paperwork. And you\u2019re going to pay a fortune that you won\u2019t get back for that \u201cprivilege.\u201d \n\nThis is not worth it. On your wedding day, you want proven reliability on some things, and your allergy management is one of them.", "NAH", "You are NTA... but neither is your fiance. That is probably hundreds extra for your plate. If finances are at all an issue, it doesn't make sense to pay over $500 so your plate comes from the caterers.", "NAH bordering on Y T A, you have a ton of allergies. They\u2019re telling you either you can pay 125% of the original cost to have a meal you can eat with everyone else, or you source your own and save the money. I understand wanting to be included on your wedding day, but for the sake of the cost and stress, finding a restaurant or private chef or something similar that can make you a single allergen-free meal would save money and time.", "I have celiac and we accommodated quite a few allergy guests (no one got sick) at my venue. They didn\u2019t charge us more either - that\u2019s kind of unfortunate. However could they bring your meal in from outside but still either made them separate or got them from somewhere else? My venue did this for kosher meals. NAH, I was this bride though.", "NTA \u2022\u00a0It's your wedding, you get your way. Period. I catered my own wedding, albeit for price and taste; not any legitimate medical concerns like OP. My mother wasted no opportunity to attempt to shame me into just \"going with the flow\" but I stuck to my guns, and the food was what everybody remembered most. Of course, then Mom's story changed to how it was all her idea, how she taught me everything I knew about cooking, etc. This is YOUR day. Make it one you can actually enjoy.", "Agree, agree, this is more of making a decision together rather than one being asshole IMO", "Also NAH\n\nBut I think for something like this a top 8 allergen free catering company might be warranted. I wouldn't expect anyone at a standard wedding venue to know how to handle this, but for example near my admittedly very large city we have a few top 8 allergen free places that specialize in this sort of thing. One of them does a gluten & dairy free chicken and waffles and I'm not gonna lie I cried a little when I went there as a treat. I've preordered things like pies and Christmas rolls before too. Since they have a year before the wedding, I'd look into seeing if there is someone who can do this without breaking the bank. It's a complicated ask, but it's something they have the time to sort out.", "Agreed. This isn't an AH situation. It's a logistics one. \n\nBut, it probably makes way more sense to get OP's meal prepared by another company/restaurant and delivered to the venue. It would be cheaper and probably safer if OP uses company/restaurant that specializes in providing meals for persons with dietary restrictions vs a kitchen that doesn't. \n\nAlso, from past experiences, in all of the excitement and well wishes the bride and groom usually only end up picking at their meals/rushing down a few bites vs sitting down and enjoying their full meal. It would suck to spend hundreds or thousands extra and not even end up getting the chance to enjoy the meal.", "Good point. I recall not getting time at my wedding.  Everyone wanted to poke,  prod, hug, photograph, and just say \"aaawwww\" at me with weird smiles", "That is a lot of money, but it IS *your wedding day*! ONE day where you get to eat nice food too, and don't feel like an outsider bringing in a lunchbox meal\n\nINFO \n\nIs the increase an actual problem? Can you afford it?\n\nI mean... most brides wear a dress for just that one day that costs more, so what is or isn't too much money is debatable. What matters is if you can afford it, and that makes you feel happy.\n\n\nOr he should join you in your meal, so at least the two of you have the same food. He does not need to do so your whole life, just for your wedding day. \nHe seems to think it is no big deal to bring your own, so let him prove that.", "You could probably start a business. Fellow celiac here, and if you could tell off my MIL too that would be glorious", "One time I went to an Ethiopian restaurant that had a gluten free German chocolate cake made of teff (the grain used in injera). Turns out teff is so perfect for German chocolate cake the nutty flavor and brown color is absolutely perfect for that cake.", "Omg our local bakery actually has a manager with celiac and it's both hilarious and amazing. They order in GF baked goods and have a seperate tiny fridge for them and seperate tongs. And they have a completely gluten free deep fryer so all their chips are completely safe. It's *the best*.", "Lol! I could but setting up a Google # is free and you could send anonymous texts from her ancestors lol!", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry, but the venue is being ridiculous. \nI work in a restaurant, and allergies are something that we take VERY seriously, but we certainly can accommodate,  especially if it's one of the people who has booked us for their wedding.\n\nI've seen Chef cook an entire meal on hot plates with pots, pans, utensils, and dishes that were all totally disinfected prior for a guest with multiple, multiple allergies.\nDoes it require some extra work? Of course. But to try to upcharge an entire event by 25% because you aren't willing to accommodate a bride or groom on their wedding day is asinine.\n\nStill, they aren't coming off as trustworthy, so bringing in your own food and asking it to be served to you is certainly reasonable.", "Can you use an outside caterer? Is so, hire one that can accommodate your needs. \n\nYou are NTA for wanting to eat at your own wedding.", "NTA, why not compromise and instead of serving regular food just do deserts.  So for example if you do the wedding late  morning or late afternoon the guests can all go eat at local restaurants or picnic it while you do all the pictures (which usually takes forever) then when pictures are done the reception picks up with a desert bar with wedding cake, grooms cake, and whatever allergy specific options you need.  Things can be ordered from different bakeries/places that can accommodate and there is nicer single use eating utensils and plates that come prepacked to prevent cross contamination as well.  The only people that will have to be served regular food would be the wedding party, and well, if you have to bring in food can't a smaller amount be ordered in that everyone will be happy eating?", "You should have chosen a venue that can accommodate or that allows outside catering, and this wouldn't be as much of an issue. ESH", "NTA.  Do you know if the venue will allow you to bring your own food in?", "NTA", "LOL, come on -- I acknowledged my bias in my initial comment, and corrected it on reading OP's comment that I quoted. Your response was written after both, so WTF?", "I doubt any venue would deny a bride with severe allergies from bringing in an outside meal. That would actually help them cover their ass, since they would not have to take on the responsibility of preparing an allergen free meal.", "Serious question. I know very little about celiac disease. You can't even eat anything that was *near* something else (like sandwiches)?\n\nGeez, I can't even imagine that.", "Oh my god, I want to go to there! That sounds amazing!", "Cross contamination is a serious issue. It\u2019s very easy to do without thinking and does get people seriously ill. \n\nI think my dad washed the cutlery drawer and contents 20 times the first month my mom knew she needed to eat gluten free.   \n\nHe\u2019d make a sandwich, need another knife or a spoon for his coffee, open the drawer/grab it and contaminate the whole content of the drawer and the drawer itself (residue on the handle).   \n\nLiving with a gluten free person while still eating bread/cookies etc. means a lot of hand and face washing.", "You're amazing! And I agree it's actually not hard or costly to accommodate most allergies. It's the lack of education and time to learn about it that's the issue. And I agree they're underpaid and overworked so can totally see why they don't want to put in so much effort to learn/change habits.", "Mmmm that sounds delicious!", "I was in the check out line one day buying gluten free Rice Crispies. The clerk asked me \u201cwhy do they label everything gluten free when it\u2019s obviously gluten free to begin with?\u201d And I was like, \u201cUmm\u2026because regular Rice Crispies are made with gluten?\u201d", "This was my thought. Don't pay the extra for the venue (if they don't want to change it at this point) but do \"splurge\" on a meal catered from a restaurant that can handle OP's food restrictions. So then OP isn't feeling like they are getting less than others; instead it is a wonderfully delicious fancy meal that they don't have to worry about...", "Flour is a common thickening agent in soups and sauces alike (that's right, even soup isn't safe). The Celiac commenter isn't kidding when they say \\*only\\* things that are specifically labeled gluten-free are safe", "For over a thousand dollars.", "A normal cake recipe with GF substitutions is sad but a proper GF cake is just as good as normal cake.\n\nMy go-to boxed cake mix is actually gluten-free because the normal version of the same cake is actually less tasty.\n\n(It's trivially easy to make it suitable for vegans too, great inclusive cake)", "We left our reception and realized we were starving. Others told us the food was good but we only ended up eating a few rushed bites here and there. A 24-hour McDonald\u2019s on the way to the hotel is the meal I remember the most.", "Yes they would agree and OP\u2019s additional comment backs that up, but cautious venues would still make sure it\u2019s in writing before they could. Harder to cover without your own paper trail.\n\nOP admitted to messing up in a comment - they booked the place without mentioning their allergens thinking it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, forgetting that when their sister got married there she brought her own food in. No wonder they\u2019re pissed."]}
