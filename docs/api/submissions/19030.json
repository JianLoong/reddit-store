But yeah.. whatever happens I hope you find a solution everyone is happy with.", "NAH. Deep cleaning and reworking recipes takes a lot of work and is expensive, so I understand why they're trying to recoup their costs. Of course you should have a meal you can eat at your wedding! Are there any caterers nearby who specialise in allergies? My thoughts are that you could make contact and see if they can supply you a single meal. Ugh. What a horror for you. I hope it works out!", "NAH.\n\nWanting a meal provided for you that you can actually eat at your wedding is totally reasonable, and the kind of thing that does make sense to spend some extra on.\n\nThat said, catering is extremely expensive, and adding on 25% to the catering cost in order to avoid cross contamination while also providing a modified, sauceless beef to the guests is a pretty big ask and it's reasonable to be concerned about the financial impact of that move.\n\nWhat I will say is that if it's your wedding, sitting down to eat the meal is usually not something you have a lot of time to do; things stay pretty busy. So eating something you can survive on for the night pre-wedding is a reasonable call regardless.", "Info: Is it too late to find a venue that can cater to your dietary restrictions?

I guess you just have to ask yourself if you would ever pay that much at a restaurant for your individual meal, whatever the amount is.

You both have a point.", "NAH\n\nFrom your point of view, it's understandable that you want to be able to enjoy a meal at your own wedding without having to worry about your allergies. It's a special occasion, and you deserve to have a memorable dining experience. You've already been accommodating by considering the options provided by the venue and exploring the possibility of having the kitchen take extra precautions to ensure your safety.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, your fianc\u00e9's concern about saving money is also valid. Weddings can be expensive, and it's natural to look for ways to cut costs. Bringing your own food could be a practical solution, especially if it saves a significant amount of money.\n\nYou both need to come to an agreement.", "A 25% increase in food costs is a *huge* amount to pay for one person's allergy, even if it is the bride's (or groom's). I mean, that would be *hundreds* of dollars. (I'm estimating $30/plate for 100 guests = $3000, 25% of which is $750. If either of those numbers are higher, it could be thousands\u2014$50/plate for 200 guests = $10,000, 25% of which is $2,500)!\n\nYou really want to spend an extra $750 (or $2,500) *for a single meal*?!\n\nJust have your favorite restaurant or a separate caterer provide a single meal of something you can eat. It can be as fancy as you like; I assure you it won't cost as much as $750.\n\nOn the other hand, is it too late to pick a different venue that can more easily accommodate your allergy? If your allergies are so severe, I'm not sure why you chose this one to begin with.", "NAH\n\nIt's your wedding too, you should be able to enjoy it. I don't know your money situation, but considering the average wedding costs $29,000 apparently, an extra 25% is significant and I'm not surprised your fiancee is concerned. It is worth $1,000 (or whatever) to you to have one plate of food? If it is, go crazy!", "NAH\n\nOfcourse you want to have a meal you can eat at your own wedding, and not bring your own food. Isn\u2019t it possible to ask another caterer who has the experience with food allergens ro prepare your meal?", "NAH - I can see it from both sides and allergies are not something to treat casually as they can very quickly become massive medical emergencies (Hopefully your aren't so bad!).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIs there a 3rd party caterer that might be of more use that could use the locations facilities? Might be worth considering and checking, they might very well be more accomodating to menu changes vs the reception locations where they probably have a set list of a few menus to reduce changes their staff need to include from function to function (Otherwise each event would end up with entirely bespoke menus which would be a lot of variances!).", "INFO: What is the actual increase in cost? Is that increase worth the cost of a single meal?\n\nI'm going to guess this is a genuine NAH - it's very reasonable for you to want a meal you can safely eat, but it's also reasonable to look for alternatives if it means your meal would end up costing thousands of dollars extra.\n\nPersonally, I think I would most agree with your fianc\u00e9, but in no way does that make you an AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Have you asked the venue if they can arrange to have a meal made at a third party site and brought in to be served at the same time as the rest? At your expense, which obviously would be expensive, but likely far, far less than adding 25% to the entire food bill.", "Often caterers will out source special meals,  kosher for example.

The venue wants to charge extra for that level of service. Your fiancee is proposing an alternative.\n\nNobody is being an asshole. Everyone is stating their needs and their requirements and looking to have a pleasant wedding.", "This sounds a bit crazy but could you incorporate a food van, in my city there are many that specifically cater to allergies and you could perhaps have them do a course and meals for you and coffees or some thing at the end of the night. And I mean a fancy food van, not like a hotdog. \ud83d\ude01 Then you are getting fresh food that is made by people who understand how to not only give you safe food but for it also to be tasty.", "The problem is that you've booked and deposited on a venue that can't or won't cater to your needs without a ridiculous upcharge to prevent cross contamination. It's 2023, and cross contam procedures are bloody common (at least where I am.)\n\nIf you weren't discussing your allergies with each venue's interview process, then it's on you and your fiance - and somehow, I suspect that is the case, and that your fiance had the initial discussions.

People are constantly coming up to the table to say hi, take pictures, etc. There\u2019s various dancing opportunities, and my wife and I also snuck outside to do a few nighttime photos with the photographer. The silver lining is that everyone else complimented the food I didn\u2019t get to eat. \n\nAnyways, your wedding might be different. If it is, go for the food you want to eat. If you think it will be like the situation I described above, grab a snack once the wedding is over, so an after party at a restaurant or bar you trust, etc. My night ended at 3am in the Carls Jr. drive thru.", "INFO are the venue happy for you to have something catered from another supplier? Either just for you or for everyone?", "Are you allowed to bring your own food in? I thought that was a liability thing too?", "NAH.  How much is the 25% more? That actually makes a huge difference to me, that could be $10k more or $1k more. Either way, I completely understand where you're coming from, but I see your side too.  Does she have a plan for how to actually seamlessly have food brought in for you that isn't you pulling out a tupperware container?  What does she envision as the solution to this?", "I'm going with soft YTA.  So you want to pay 25% more for everybody, just so you can eat the same meal as everyone else, and might still have problems?  If money is no object, they go for it.  But that seems a silly way to spend money if you have other options. I would place an order with a restaurant and have someone from the bridal party go pick it up just before meals are served.  I'm sure the venue would be OK with something like that vs having issues with you getting deathly ill.", "NAH.\n\nIdk if you cook, but reworking and testing recipes when you have a list of allergens is expensive and time consuming work, especially if you're allergic to core ingredients that are the basis of every recipe I cook. Slightly different cook times because of ingredient swaps, needing to change out techniques because one needs an ingredient that is an allergen to make an impact, etc, means that all the recipes need a new trial run. And that's just with me, a home cook at thanksgiving navigating gluten free/soy free/dairy free/onion free/10 veggies and herbs free cooking, I'm not a business that needs a profit.\n\nIt would have been better to book a venue without a contract for food and beverage and then seek out an allergen-specialized catering company to bring in your food if you wanted everyone to eat the same thing rather than expecting a current business to adapt everything they make for average weddings without an increase in cost to you.\n\nIf money matters, it likely would be cheaper to hire a personal chef that specializes in allergen sensitive cooking than make allergen-sensitive meals for everyone. The last time I hired a personal chef for a date night, it was like $50/hr plus the cost of groceries for our meal. They could likely closely mirror what the catering kitchen menu is, but at the cost of only recipe developing and feeding you vs sanitizing and making everything allergen free for the whole wedding.", "NAH. Couldn't you have a fancy restaurant DD or UE a really nice meal? I get the problem, really, I do -- it's your wedding too! -- but there's just so many factors, including financial and food safety, that this might be the best option.", "NAH\nYou do have a lot of allergies and I\u2019m afraid you will run into this same scenario even if you go with a different venue. Let\u2019s say you do pay the 25% up charge. Are you and your fianc\u00e9 willing to cut the budget somewhere else? And if you are, do you really trust that there will be absolutely no cross contamination? Are you prepared to risk having an allergic reaction on your wedding day? Really it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interests to bring food you know you can eat.", "NTA. I understand where your fiancee is coming from but it's your special day too. I can't imagine bringing my own home cooked food to my wedding while everyone else gets nice food I've paid for. It's a one off, just pay the extra 25%.", "NAH\n\nI can understand wanting to have a meal you can eat at your own wedding but do you really want to pay 25% more for everything just so you can have a plate ot two of food? It just doesn't make any financial sense. If I  was in your situation I would just bring my own food like normal.", "Of you're allergic to everything, why would you trust any food that you didn't make yourself?  So you'd rather spend thousand more on good instead of just bring a sandwich or something?\n\nYTA", "NTA - I don\u2019t know but I feel like if the place I\u2019m having my wedding reception can\u2019t make sure that I (the person paying) am able to eat, I need to go elsewhere for my reception. Their only compromise is to not feed you? I don\u2019t like that.", "NAH\n\nBoth of you have very reasonable points. AND it was on you for not checking before putting the money down.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't take the 25% increase options for two main reasons:\n\n1) way too much money that can be used for something else (not saying the charge is unreasonable tho)\n\n2) I wouldn't trust that they REALLY can make all the meals allergy free, I wouldn't risk it tbh, specially with so much money and my health on the line\n\nI would go for the food in option. Cheaper, no risk for health AND it could be something special for you, and even both of you, different from the rest of the guests. You still would eat at your wedding, being that the main issue here. Win win", "I really empathize with your situation, but given the current staffing crisis in the hospitality industry, I wouldn't trust them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I would bring my own food because although that is annoying, it is not as bad as having an allergic reaction on your wedding day and ending up in the hospital.", "YTA Shelling out an extra grand and possibly changing the entire menu just so one person (regardless of who they are) can eat maybe three bites of food is an asshole move. I\u2019m sorry you have so many allergies but because there are so many you should have done your due diligence way before you even agreed on a caterer. Order food from your favorite safe restaurant and save that extra grand for an actually needed expense.", "INFO: Is this the only vendor available? Your list of allergies isn't that \"crazy\" to make a menu around. \nAnd your NTA for wanting to enjoy the wedding menu either.", "NAH but depending on what exactly you\u2019re allergic to and what dishes they serve, it might not actually be really reworking the dishes so much as a compromise. She is going to need to live with your allergens for the rest of your life. She needs to learn how to cope with them now. The answer of well just bring one in when it\u2019s both of your special day is NOT the answer. The caterer should be able to accommodate without something crazy as 25% more. 10% I can see. 25% is a cash grab. If you can name of several dishes that are allergy friendly for you and possibly provide them allergy friendly recipe as a starting point for them, that should be sufficient to start. It\u2019s a give and take situation when there\u2019s a lot. We do this all the time with a 150 student marching band and staff. It isn\u2019t that hard to accommodate.", "I think what your fianc\u00e9 says makes a lot of sense. Listen, you\u2019re genetically jacked up and have all these problems. It\u2019s not your fault,  but it is what it is. Weddings are already wildly expensive and having an additional 25% price when you\u2019re the only one who needs it?\n\nCome on. You have to know he\u2019s right.", "YTA no one is saying you can't have a meal at your wedding", "NTA. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask to be able to eat at your own wedding reception.  I honestly would think about changing venues to someplace that can accommodate you.  The kitchen should be able to accommodate you without the up-charge.", "This situation could have been avoided if you had been extremely clear up front before booking the venue that you have these food allergies. It's not your fault you have all those allergies, but sorry to say it IS your fault that you went ahead with a booking without clarifying that first. If I had that many dietary restrictions, the food would be the first thing that factored into any decision making about the venue.\n\nHowever, that is hindsight which we all know is a wonderful thing, I guess there's not much you can do about it now. I don't think you're the asshole here just a little na\u00efve, but I do think since you've really brought this situation on yourself, you should compromise and go with the option to bring food in.", "NAH\n\nPersonally I wouldn't pay an upcharge of 25% but would just have an absolutely fabulous meal delivered.\n\n Whether the charge is reasonable doesn't matter. I would imagine the restaurant actually doesn't want to do it and so is hoping that you don't actually have them do it.\n\nHonestly you are probably not going to even enjoy any food at your own wedding because you are not going to have a leisurely time to enjoy your food. \n\nIf it makes you feel better take the 25% you are saving by NOT having the kitchen decontaminated and spend it on something splurge worthy - whether it is something just for you like beautiful jewelry or something for you as a couple like an enhanced vacation, for me it would be money better spent than on essentially a meal that you won't really enjoy anyway.", "Like others have said and you admit, very poor planning.\n\nFor some reason people become so emotional or go into some hormone induced mentality - common sence goes out the window.\n\nThink about the insane extra cost to cater for your needs, why? I can understand it's a wedding but there are other compromise you can do which will make your experience so much better and you would be laughing about it in the future going through the videos and pictures with friends and families. \n\nThe compromise is to organise your favourite food, gourmet food, seafood etc that you can eat and have it delivered at the right time, it will make everyone else jealous and you have saved yourself \n$$$thousands which you can now spend extra on your wife to be hoping she forgives you \ud83d\ude01\n\nLook OP I don't want to say you are TA as it will make you sad, since it's a very important day to you I will say NTA hope that makes you \ud83e\udd23\n\nGo hug your fiancee and tell them they are right, give her a big kiss and show her this reddit post of yours.\n\nGood luck", "NTA you want to be safe and enjoy your own wedding it\u2019s a day about you and your fianc\u00e9 you should be able to eat what everybody else is eating", "NTA\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9e was the allergic one then this would not even be an argument.\n\nTell her to save money on her dress and see what she says.", "Adding to this, myself, as well many others I've heard online, barely ate at my wedding. You're so busy and happy with everything the last thing you want to is sit at your table and be forced to eat. I think I had one or two nibbles before running off to say hello to everyone.\n\nNo judgement but if you want my opinion don't waste 25% of the entire cost on one meal you're going to forget about. Don't have nothing, but see if you can organise a pre packaged meal to quickly scoff down without focusing too much on it. I know it sucks but I can promise you the meal you eat isn't the highlight of the wedding.", "Very much this. I understand OP's frustration, but also understand the kitchen and fiance's points.\n\nPerhaps there is a compromise where someone you trust makes a nice meal for you in a safe kitchen, and the venue still does the plating and serving? That way you all save some money but you still get the stress-free experience of having a lovely meal you don't have to cook yourself served to you. Or even just have something catered from a 'safe' restaurant for yourself with the same process. You deserve a nice meal on yout special day.", "Maybe something brought in catered from somewhere fancy so it\u2019s at least equivalent quality to the wedding food? OP deserves a fancy restaurant quality meal for once and it\u2019s worth spending on that (even if it\u2019s a few hundred dollars for one meal).", "Oh absolutely.  Those wedding sharks will charge you 25% to 200% more and not change a thing", "Their fiancee thinks they should eat leftovers at their own wedding, how the fuck is that not an asshole move?", "Yes! I wonder if another caterer could mimic the other dishes for OP, but make it without the allergens. That way, no cross-contamination (minus other people\u2019s plates around OP) and they can all enjoy the same meal.", "I am basically all the food allergies in a trenchcoat of a human and I was going to say NAH because not being able to eat the same as other people and \u2018break bread\u2019 or have the \u2018wedding breakfast\u2019 that joins you together at auspicious times is really pyschologically impactful. For many people 25% \u2018not missing out\u2019 tax is worth it at important occasions. (I rarely eat out but will often eat just the bread basket while paying full price to make up for using a seat and causing staff more work for example.)\n\nBut then I read OP did not do any research, due diligence or check his own allergies before the deposits were paid and time is tight and I\u2019m going YTA. Because it is up to the allergic person to do as much checking as possible before asking waitstaff, kitchens, friends, family or radically altering the budget of your whole damn wedding and impacting the bride.\n\nI actually share some of his allergies and as they are not in the \u2018major 14\u2019 category under EU rules there is no way he has tried to eat anything without having to check for garlic because at this point it\u2019s in desserts it\u2019s such a common ingredient and utter nightmare to be allergic to. I work with food and asking for the deep clean, rewritten recipes and apparently serving no sauce to guests is a trifecta of \u2018are you fucking kidding me?\u2019 requests at this stage.\n\nI suspect the 25% includes asshole tax since he did not book the caterers with the info upfront and has given them a hella difficult last minute bait and switch. He needs to pack his own meal because this is a nightmare for the caterers and his other co-host, the bride who will have to spend her wedding explaining why there is no sauce and discussing allergies and generally since people get very passionate about sauce, all the guests muttering about dry meat. (I despise condiments and anything that makes food \u2018wet\u2019 and this blows people\u2019s minds more that the allergies.)\n\nHe\u2019s basically derailing his own reception to every one else\u2019s impact because he didn\u2019t check at all at the start. I would be absolutely livid with my partner if they did this at any major event let alone our wedding. My partner would absolutely tell me to pack a meal and like it if I pulled the same stunt. If they didn\u2019t rethink marrying me for such an AH move. My partner double checks to tag team me on allergies but if I have made zero effort to not almost kill myself, I get zero sympathy. \n\nI also constantly have to host meals I cannot actually eat because no one else willingly eats as much completely bland chicken and rice as me.

By that logic you wouldn\u2019t buy fancy clothes that you wouldn\u2019t buy for a regular restaurant evening.", "Not only cleaned but many commercial kitchen will bring in a licensed contractor for allergy cleanings so the liability is on them if someone gets sick", "I would add, who books a venue without trying the menu once first?

He said in a comment he didn't tell them about his allergies because he thought it would be easy to solve this.\nThat's FULLY on him.", "It doesn't seem like you actually worked in the kitchen. Cross-contamination is a thing and they have to deep clean before cooking with ANYTHING that could cause an allergic reaction. Otherwise they could get sued.", "Why is that on the fiancee? He knew about his allergies and didn't ask the venue if they could accommodate, that's on him. \nShe shouldn't be the one cooking for him because of his mistake. \nHe can order his own food.", "It's already clean as in hygienic. This is more like, they have to remove all of his allergens from everywhere in the building, like the refrigerators for example, and then deep clean the fridge. They wouldn't normally deep clean the fridge between every wedding. Now extrapolate that to the ovens, cabinets, etc. It's a lot of labor.", "Not that simple. There is cleaning then there is guaranteeing that a tiny amount of garlic plus a long list of other allergens are not present. The fridge needs to be emptied and sanitized so anything with an allergen can't cross contaminate, that requires a separate fridge or wasting ingredients in it. They need to change the recipes, that may mean sourcing from a different supplier where they don't get as deep a discount.\n\nMany companies will also contract a cleaning company for a deep clean for allergens because their own workers may miss a spot etc and the licensed company carries insurance", "Yeah tbh it seems a really weird thing to focus on with everything else that happens at a wedding.\n\nThe only food I remember eating at my wedding was nachos.. cause I was pregnant when I got married and was craving them so my dad whipped them up for me lol.", "\"the venue still does the plating and serving? \"\n\nThis increases the chances of cross contamination.
