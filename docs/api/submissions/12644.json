I want to continue with a planned trek even though my daughter is having a baby a few days after I'm due home. 2.) I might be considered an asshole for not canceling in order to ensure I'm here for the delivery.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Just tell her you will be there the moment you get back and assure her you want to be there. If something happens early and you can\u2019t be there, oh well.

As you stated in your post your physical health is such that you might not be able to do this later if you postponed it. You deserve to take this trip. It doesn't make you a bad mother or grandmother if you do. Your daughter is an adult who is living her life and growing her family. You are an adult who raised her. You get to be a little selfish now. If your daughter doesn't see that than she is the selfish if she truly thinks your life should be put on hold because of her choices and life events.", "NTA, since you made theses plans before she told you not after. Unless you knew they were trying or they specifically asked you not to plan anything around a certain time and you promised not to plan anything/to be in the delivery room-which does not appear to be the case based on the information you provided-then you are completely in the right. It is not your responsibility to reschedule your life for other people. \n\nThat being said, I doubt your daughter will take it well considering your complicated relationship. Good Luck! Also have a great trip! And I hope you are able to be there for the delivery if that is what you want!", "NTA \nDo the best you can as far as being there, that's all any of us can do.", "I've done a lot of backpacking and LD treks...go for it!!! NTA. And have a great time. The feeling you get as you complete each day...not sure what kind of trek but would love to know! I've mostly backpacked in the Sierra mountains, trail hopped in Canada, and 3 LD treks in Europe. I'm trying to plan another lol.", "NTA go on your trip", "NTA. Go on your trip and enjoy it. She has a partner it\u2019s not like she\u2019s alone", "NAH. Your daughter's position is understandable. She is probably nervous and your presence would be reassuring. There's nothing wrong about that. On your side, you've wanted this trek for a while and you're right, you might never get a chance at it again. You have already paid and placed the reservations ahead of time, AND there's no guarantee they even will conflict. There's nothing wrong about that.\n\nI will tell you that you shouldn't be surprised if they do begrudge you for missing your grandchild's birth, if you were to miss it because of her early labor. Their feelings would be valid, but your feelings are valid too. Hopefully it doesn't come to that! I hope you get to both enjoy your trek and the birth of a healthy grandchild :).
