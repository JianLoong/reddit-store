I want to continue with a planned trek even though my daughter is having a baby a few days after I'm due home. 2.)

As you stated in your post your physical health is such that you might not be able to do this later if you postponed it. You deserve to take this trip. It doesn't make you a bad mother or grandmother if you do. Your daughter is an adult who is living her life and growing her family. You are an adult who raised her. You get to be a little selfish now. If your daughter doesn't see that than she is the selfish if she truly thinks your life should be put on hold because of her choices and life events.", "NTA, since you made theses plans before she told you not after. Unless you knew they were trying or they specifically asked you not to plan anything around a certain time and you promised not to plan anything/to be in the delivery room-which does not appear to be the case based on the information you provided-then you are completely in the right. It is not your responsibility to reschedule your life for other people. \n\nThat being said, I doubt your daughter will take it well considering your complicated relationship. Good Luck! Also have a great trip! And I hope you are able to be there for the delivery if that is what you want!", "NTA \nDo the best you can as far as being there, that's all any of us can do.", "I've done a lot of backpacking and LD treks...go for it!!! NTA. And have a great time. The feeling you get as you complete each day...not sure what kind of trek but would love to know! I've mostly backpacked in the Sierra mountains, trail hopped in Canada, and 3 LD treks in Europe. I'm trying to plan another lol.", "NTA go on your trip", "NTA. Go on your trip and enjoy it. She has a partner it\u2019s not like she\u2019s alone", "NAH. Your daughter's position is understandable. She is probably nervous and your presence would be reassuring. There's nothing wrong about that. On your side, you've wanted this trek for a while and you're right, you might never get a chance at it again. You have already paid and placed the reservations ahead of time, AND there's no guarantee they even will conflict. There's nothing wrong about that.\n\nI will tell you that you shouldn't be surprised if they do begrudge you for missing your grandchild's birth, if you were to miss it because of her early labor. Their feelings would be valid, but your feelings are valid too. Hopefully it doesn't come to that! I hope you get to both enjoy your trek and the birth of a healthy grandchild :).

And how far along was she at the time of announcement? \n\nWhile OP is NTA either way, it would change my opinions on the daughter.\n\nHope OP goes on the trip and enjoys the new grand baby.", "\u201cMy daughter said she expects me in the delivery room, period.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s nice, but the word she\u2019s looking for is \u201cwants,\u201d not \u201cexpects.\u201d  She\u2019s not your manager, so she can\u2019t just lay out expectations and assume you\u2019ll jump at her command.  There is nothing wrong with parents not being in the delivery room, for whatever reason - they live too far away, they have their own stuff going on, they can\u2019t make it to the hospital in time, birth isn\u2019t a spectator sport.\n\nI say this as a mother: you don\u2019t need a freaking entourage for your delivery.  My husband was there and I texted with two of my friends.\n\nTell your daughter that you will be arriving back on X date and will do what you can.  Tell her to stop with the business of \u201cexpecting\u201d grown adults to do her bidding.", "NTA.", "NTA. You can\u2019t help the timing of life. But I doubt your daughter will take you not being there well. But be honest with her from the get go about the dates of your trip and that you might not be there. But you will 100% be by her side if you can. She might blow up at you and decline to have you out of the delivery room, but that\u2019s ultimately her choice. \n\nOne suggestion that might help her, especially in this case where you might not be there to support her, help her find a doula.  Doulas are great especially for people who want the extra support. Maybe suggest it, so that even if you can\u2019t be there, she will still have a lot of support. Do some research, find some in your area, and your daughter can meet with them and then decide how she wants to proceed.", "NTA and please don\u2019t let anyone guilt you. I\u2019d you don\u2019t do this you\u2019ll fester with resentment. You\u2019ve raised your children and deserve to make special memories too. I hope you have a wonderful trip and your daughter stops being a AH.", "Even if you canceled your long planned trip there could be any number of things that could possibly stop you being in the delivery room or being late. Weather, traffic, car accident, car breakdown, stroke, go to the loo in the middle of the night walk into a wall and give yourself concussion (ok that last one might just be a me thing). \nWith luck your trek will be amazing and you\u2019ll be home with at least 24 hours minimum to spar, probably a lot more. \nNTA do NOT miss out on your trek. Seriously, you\u2019ve been planning this for YEARS and training for MONTHS, I\u2019m sure she knows that, if she expects you to miss out because she may, possibly, maybe go into labour early she\u2019s being selfish.", "Although I feel like more information would be helpful, I do agree that the daughter will probably resent this forever."]}
