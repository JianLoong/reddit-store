How do you blame someone that you didn't include in the chat? Very strange of them .Try not to stress about it. They wouldn't take no for an answer.", "This not the first time I've been yelled at for not knowing ahead of time that ppl were coming over, but said ppl assumed I did.", "They all have come over to my place without warning at one point or another. And it's always been my fault I didnt know. And they have always told me my cooking tastes awful, so if I'd known this time, I could've gotten better, maybe.", "They've this sort of stuff before.", "They are gaslighting you, trying to imply you agreed to something, when you were not part of the conversation, then getting mad at you for not doing the thing, they assigned to you, without your consent, and without ever actually communicating the thing you were supposed to do, then blaming you for not doing it.  It\u2019s not like you operate via psychic network, ya know!  I am sorry they did this, makes me mad thinking about it. Turn your phone off, lock the door. Ha!", "My family did that shit to me so many times! Unfortunately it was me that needed to go there and I couldn't slam the door in their faces.", "They sound awful. I wouldn't work to improve anything for people who talk to and treat you like that.\n\nYou did **nothing** wrong.", "Good lord, they're nasty and clearly doing this on purpose. Don't feel bad. Keep being assertive with them ad don't doubt yourself.", "Reason enough not to open the door to them in the first place!", "*<According to everyone, we all agreed to do this here in the Group Chat weeks ago. Problem is, IM NOT IN THE GROUP CHAT TO BEGIN WITH!>*\n\nSo, nobody wanted to host, and as you were not there to object, they decided on your place... \n\nOMG. The entitledment runs high in your siblings...\n\nPlease keep us posted on this one.\n\nNTA", "NTA... it is rude to show up uninvited.  If it was a surprise, they should have brought dinner.", "No it is not your fault. They invited themselves for a dinner you knew nothing about without checking with you. \n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNONE of this is YOUR fault - don't bend to these grazies.", "NTA. They invaded your home and you have the right to not invite people into your home and safe space.", "LOL!!! Good for you! NTA all day!", "? Did I just read this? Is it a comedy sketch? Nta.", "Nah\u2026.Not for saying no, but I just cannot imagine e slamming the door in my mothers face.", "NTA, they should\u2019ve let you decided whether or not you wanted it at your place.", "NTA\n\n1. You weren't in the group chat\n2. No one reached out to you about it\n3. They know it's a small place\n4. You never invited them to begin with", "NTA\nYou were never asked if you can host. You never invited them. You didn\u2019t know about their plans, hence you didn\u2019t agree with it. \nWhat sort of logic goes through your family\u2019s minds?\nEven if they agreed via a group chat (that you\u2019re not in), they should have said something to you well before hand. Putting space/room aside. They should have messaged you (before hand) about food, that be when you would have known about their plans & put a stop to it. Did they bring food with them or were they expecting you to have food ready for them, without knowing that they were coming? \nAlso you could\u2019ve been away on a trip (or heading to your mom\u2019s place, expecting dinner there) & they be knocking at an empty apartment.\n\nAfter this stunt, I hope you go no contact. Bonus- moving to a new place & not giving them your new address.", "What in the world? Your reaction was perfect.  Block them. \n\nNTA", "This has got to be BS.\n1. If you mother is on your side why didn't she let you know beforehand.\n\n\n2. If this is true, do you really need to come here to ask people if you were an AH for not letting a group of people show up uninvited?\n\n3. Don't phones have the option to mute / ignore messages?", "They didn't have her in the chat because then she could say no.", "That happened to me, too. All my life, people thought I was present at an event when I hadn't been there, or that I had been told about plans when I had not.

I wasn't invited to that since it was a closed group party, and of course I didn't attend!!
