How do you blame someone that you didn't include in the chat? Very strange of them .Try not to stress about it. They wouldn't take no for an answer.", "This not the first time I've been yelled at for not knowing ahead of time that ppl were coming over, but said ppl assumed I did.", "They all have come over to my place without warning at one point or another. And it's always been my fault I didnt know. And they have always told me my cooking tastes awful, so if I'd known this time, I could've gotten better, maybe.", "They've this sort of stuff before.", "They are gaslighting you, trying to imply you agreed to something, when you were not part of the conversation, then getting mad at you for not doing the thing, they assigned to you, without your consent, and without ever actually communicating the thing you were supposed to do, then blaming you for not doing it.  It\u2019s not like you operate via psychic network, ya know!  I am sorry they did this, makes me mad thinking about it. Turn your phone off, lock the door.
