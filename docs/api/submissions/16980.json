They each pick whatever restaurant they want for us all to go to, and order what they want. Over the years this has meant everything from \"banana split for dinner\" to a steakhouse to omakase to hand-pulled noodles. We've never put restrictions on it except it has to be within an hour's drive each way.\n\nYesterday, my daughter came to us with her choice, and I was caught completely off guard by her selection. It's an \\*extremely\\* high end restaurant that costs $315/person. That's a set tasting menu, so there's no way to, e.g., let the kids order something expensive and my wife and I order the cheapest thing. (I checked whether they had age restrictions and they permit guests over 13.) With tax, tip, and parking, it'd be north of $1500. This restaurant is an extreme outlier for our city, which is why it caught me so off-guard. Even the fancy steakhouses here only run $100/person even if you order a nice steak, an appetizer for the table, and desserts. We've certainly let the kids pick expensive restaurants before, but prior to this the most expensive things they've ordered were a $55 ribeye or a $60 omakase; we generally budget around $1000 total for both meals, and anything left over goes into the family vacation fund.\n\nMy wife and I told her that it was out of our budget, and she got very upset and said that we had promised her \"any restaurant she wanted.\" Which is true, we did say that. And she said I was going back on my word. I said, quite honestly, that it never occurred to me that she could \\*find\\* a $300/head restaurant, let alone ask to go there, so it didn't occur to me to tell her that was off-limits. She got mad and said I was implying that she was being greedy. I said, \"I don't think you're greedy. I do think you're being unrealistic.\" She burst into tears and said she couldn't trust us anymore.\n\nMy wife and I are in agreement, but my sister (who is very close with my daughter) called to tell me that it's important to never break a promise to a child. I asked her if she would have anticipated being asked for dinner at the only $300/person restaurant in a five hour radius, and she said no, but that that's why she'd just never make promises to her children. She says I need to apologize and either take her (we can, technically, afford it if we make cuts to other \"fun\" budgets), or apologize and find a way to make it up to her.\n\nI want to note that my daughter is not generally a person who asks for expensive things. She has never demanded lavish gifts, she's pretty sensible about money generally speaking, and she's always shown gratitude for the advantages that we all have. I don't know where this came from--I did ask, and she just said that she wanted to try it and we promised.\n\nSo, AITA for saying \"no\" here?\n\nEDIT: Think French Laundry-ish for the restaurant type.", "created_utc": 1683821538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ertp2/aita_for_going_back_on_my_word_to_my_daughter/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have been giving an inch and she\u2019s trying to take a mile. \n\nThis is like telling a kid you\u2019ll help buy them a car when they graduate, and they want a Lamborghini. That\u2019s just not realistic. \n\nIf the sister is so concerned you\u2019re going back on your word, then let her pay for you guys. $300 per person is nothing to scoff at, and that money could be better spent around the house or toward something usable long term.\n\nI\u2019d suggest setting a $100 budget per person going forward, and if the daughter wants to front the other $200 to go, then maybe take them that way.\n\nNTA; but set clearer expectations going forward.", "NTA\n\nYes keeping promises to your child is extremely important, however it needs to be within reason and possible. One thing that makes breaking promises to your child a very bad thing is that a lot of parents aren't upfront and honest about it and hope they end up forgetting. But in this case, you explained thoroughly to your daughter why it wasn't possible this time (she's 15 too so she's too old to throw a tantrum) You have kept your promise for all the other dinners in their lives, but this is definitely too much. \n\nThis is also a good lesson to teach kids that they can't *always* get what they want, promise or not. Unfortunately that's not how the world works and there are things out of our control and unexpected. You can try your best to find a compromise though. $1500 for a family meal is pretty ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\nOkay, I understand she is upset about this, they are 15-17 years and should know that $300 per person is A LOT of money for a restaurant. I do feel as though she is being very dramatic about this situation with the whole 'I cant trust you guys anymore.' simply bc you guys said no to the extremely expensive restaurant. \n\n**\"my sister (who is very close with my daughter) called to tell me that it's important to never break a promise to a child. I asked her if she would have anticipated being asked for dinner at the only $300/person restaurant in a five hour radius, and she said no,\"**\n\nI have issues with this for many reasons, your sister is feeding into your daughters tantrum. Even she herself said ''she wouldn't do it'', so she should understand the severity of that much money being spent on a single restaurant for one family meal.", "NTA. \n\nIf your sister wants your daughter to go so badly, she can take her herself. I won't hold my breath waiting for her offer to come through on that, though. \n\nNo, look, you guys obviously have learned a valuable lesson here for the future and I hope will be setting some sort of budget on this moving forward. But you're not the assholes for declining to pay for a dinner that costs more than a lot of vacations. \n\nAt 15, your daughter is more than old enough to understand that money doesn't grow on trees - your sister is acting like your daughter is a 5 year old who was promised an ice cream cone and didn't get one. That's not what this is, at all. \n\nYou explained the situation to your daughter and your sister, and that's really the end of the discussion. Your daughter can feel hurt - her reaction seems about in-line with what I'd expect from a teenager in this situation. But your sister needs to stop feeding into it unless she plans on taking your daughter herself, and as I said above, I won't hold my breath.", "NTA. It's out of your budget, simple as that. You weren't mean about it, just practical. Your sister has no dog in this fight...she isn't footing the bill here. She can just butt the hell out of it.\n\nThis is a really good opportunity for your daughter to learn about practical limitations and the impact of unreasonable requests.", "NTA Tell your sister to butt out and your daughter to stop trying to manipulate you.", "**NTA**   Now is a good time for your daughter to learn that her wanting something doesn't entitle her to bankrupt the family budget.  It doesn't seem that you have instilled any kind of money awareness in your kids.   Does she have chores and an allowance?   How long would it take for her to save 1K for a three person dinner.   Ask her why she would think it was okay.\n\nYour sister is a real AH.  Tell her to butt out and she can pay for the dinner herself.", "NTA, you'd be setting a precedent for future dinners if you follow through. They're getting older, so it's not just sundaes for dinner. It's prestige and gastronomy. They sound like smart kids.\n\nYou're a parent and allowed to say no. You're not a bad parent for saying no. You have higher callings (haha), college, cars, weddings, down deposits.\n\nE: word", "NTA\n\nI feel like you handled this well, and whether she\u2019s close or not, your sister has no right to comment either, that\u2019s nosey of her. \n\nAnd while your daughter is generally frugal or at least mindful, for her to get upset and not try to understand is also ridiculous. She needs to realize this will happen in the world all the time. Shit always falls through, so she\u2019s gonna be let down eventually", "NTA - I think that this would be a great opportunity to sit down with your kids and go over finances and budgeting. Discuss needs vs wants and how you have planned for this dinner. Let your kids know, that if they want to try this place, you could post-pone the dinner and put more money aside to do this.", "NTA. But this is a lesson learned to not make such generalized promises. You can pick any restaurant within a 1 hour drive and each year we'll decide on a budget, or something to that effect. \n\nBut I get where you are coming from. Who would've thought a 15yo would find let alone ask to go to a place that is 300 bucks per person. I've never even seen one. Then again, I live in a midwest town lol. And I bet you they have those tiny, bite-sized appetizers and dishes.", "NTA\n\nI think you should ask her more questions as to how she even found such a place, there's no way she just knew about it. She either saw it online or went to google searching via $$$$  \n\n\nTell her to find somewhere cheaper and going forward, put a limit on it", "NTA. $1500 for a dinner is insane. I'm sure if you asked her 10 years from now if she would drop that amount of money on a single meal she would laugh.", "NTA-   \nYour sister needs to butt out.   \nThis is a great time to teach your daughter about the phrase \"within reason.\"", "Just take them and tell them the vacation fund will be less because of this meal, and she can choose to dine there and have a minimalist vacation!", "NTA, \u201canything you want\u201d typically is referring to the food, not the price. As a teenager who is starting to learn the value of a dollar she should be understand that her ask was unreasonable.", "Rules are far and wide created to stop a problem that exists before the rule. Yeah, the rule changed because you abused it lol. NTA", "NTA, she is attempting to take advantage of your kindness. If your sister has so much to say she can chip in for the cost.", "NTA. My mom promised to take me on a trip when I graduated high school, but my family\u2019s financial circumstances changed and that was no longer feasible. I wasn\u2019t mad, that\u2019s just life. If your kid is really dead set on this, you could offer to take her but make clear that she\u2019s going to have to forego some other luxuries she\u2019s used for a while to make the budget work.", "What a tough one! I\u2019m going with NTA, because this was a completely unexpected blind sided outlier of a situation.", "NTA  \nSister saying she would just give up on making promises to children all together is a bit much and shows, to me, she doesn't maybe quite get it.  \nThis kind of thing is a very normal part of growing up, even in a really nice home. Your parents want the best for you but can't always provide everything you want. As long you're patient and apologetic with her, you're being very reasonable.  \nIt was an honest oversight on your part.", "NTA, I feel like  you and your daughter are in a difficult situation where expectations and realities are clashing.  I think that most of the time parents need to honor promises to their children, but sometimes circumstances arise that makes it difficult to fulfill those promises and that's okay.In this case, it's understandable that she's upset and disappointed, but it's also important to  remember that most 15y/o need guidance  when it comes to financial responsibility and budgeting.", "NTA\n\nTeenagers are difficult and you handled this well. You say it's out of nowhere and who knows, maybe she's been watching a lot of top chef. Either way a 15 year old isn't going to fully conceptualize what budgeting looks like. Set a price cap for this and the future, she'll probably sulk the whole meal this year but again, teenagers. I don't think it means a whole lot more than teens being teens if she's generally a good kid.", "NTA - it\u2019s not a reasonable request IMO. I would ask her to find another restaurant and maybe you could plan to try that restaurant for a different special occasion where you can save up for it. \nAnd for future things would put in a budget cap, but I get that it hasn\u2019t been needed till now.", "NTA. Your daughter is testing boundaries. This is a good opportunity to teach her that when someone else is paying for a meal, common courtesy and social etiquette dictate that it\u2019s an a-hole move to pick the most expensive restaurant just because you \u201ctechnically\u201d can, because you\u2019re not paying. Tell her that that kind of behavior will make people not want to do nice things for her.", "NTA. Your daughter made a ridiculous and unreasonable restaurant selection. My guess is for some sort of social media flex for her friends?", "INFO is it possible for just one parent and her to go alone to celebrate?", "\r  \nNavigating situations like these can be challenging, and it's important to consider the perspectives of everyone involved. In this case, it seems like there was a miscommunication regarding the expectations and boundaries for the restaurant selection. While it's understandable that you feel caught off guard by your daughter's choice, it's also important to acknowledge that you did make a promise to let each child pick any restaurant they wanted.\r  \n\r  \nIn this situation, I don't believe you are necessarily the asshole (NTA) for saying \"no.\" It's clear that the price of the restaurant exceeds what you had initially anticipated, and it's reasonable to express your concerns about the cost. However, it's crucial to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, as your daughter feels disappointed and her trust has been affected.\r  \n\r  \nTo resolve the situation, consider having an open and honest conversation with your daughter. Apologize for the miscommunication and explain that you underestimated the potential cost of the restaurant she chose. Engage in a dialogue with her about budget constraints and financial responsibilities, emphasizing the importance of finding a balance between treating oneself and being mindful of expenditures.\r  \n\r  \nYou can explore alternatives together, such as suggesting a compromise where you visit a less expensive but still enjoyable restaurant and plan another special outing in the future. By involving her in the decision-making process and ensuring her voice is heard, you can work towards rebuilding trust and finding a resolution that satisfies both parties.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, it's essential to foster open communication, understanding, and compromise within the family to navigate situations like these successfully.", "This is hard for me to judge. I think in the end, YTA.  You made a promise. We teach our children to keep their word and not make excuses. There is no reason why you couldn\u2019t have researched this yourself, since your daughter was able to do it. You made an assumption that there wouldn\u2019t be a restaurant that exceeded your limit. So, yes; I\u2019m going with YTA. Don\u2019t make a promise if you can\u2019t keep it. Listen to your sister\ud83d\ude42", "ESH. Your daughter has taken you at your word regarding any restaurant.\n\nCompletely understand that it might be an outlier but a caveat of \u2018within reason\u2019 at the time of the statement could have avoided this. Your daughters reaction is a bit ott at the same time.\n\nIf it\u2019s not possible to go to this place this year, is it something that as a family you can \u2018save up\u2019 for over the next year or so (including contributions from your son and daughter) to be able to treat you all, but still also go somewhere different this year as well? \n\nPerhaps explain to your daughter that the cost of the restaurant is too high as a lump sum without budgeting for it in advance.", "As kids grow up, they want to take more risks. Bigger and more expensive restaurants are to be expected - especially for a meal that's a once-a-year Mega Treat.\n\nLook, I can see why you flinched. Dropping $1500 on dinner? Yikes. That's nuking the family vacation over a couple plates of food.\n\nBut you've never flinched at a price tag before. And, from your description, it doesn't sound like your daughter wasn't told that there was a price cap. Just that the restaurant is her choice.\n\nIf I was your daughter, and I saw that chef-personalized sushi was on the table, I wouldn't have thought a $300-a-head restaurant was a problem.\n\nIt's a close one, but I'm going to have to give this a very gentle YTA instead of the N A H I was originally planning. After the age of 13, both of your kids should have known what the secret 'rules' to this present were.\n\nSit her down - with your son, your wife, and the sister who is calling you a rule breaker - and show her the inner workings of your deal. Then decide as a family what you want to do.\n\nAs a teenager, who will have to make and follow her own budget in a couple years, I'm sure it will be a great learning experience for her.", "YTA\n\nCmon you say you can afford it so go. Or if you truly cant afford it then just have her go with 1 friend or alone\u2026\n\nIts a one time thing. You did promise her without any restrictions now you are trying to go back on your word", "This one\u2019s hard\u2026and I only say that because you should\u2019ve known that when the kids get older, their taste palate and wanted experiences would change. A 10 year old requesting their favorite meal can be drastically different then a 15/17 year old requesting their favorite/new meal to try. Everyone\u2019s taste palate changes as we age, so \u201crules and implications\u201d probably should\u2019ve been thought of way back when. \n\nOverall, I think there can be a compromise. Maybe the whole family doesn\u2019t need to go? Maybe this restaurant has \u201ccheaper days/hours\u201d where if you go at a certain time the price per person is dropped (sorta like a buffet)?

Seems like your daughter has no real frame of reference for her limitations when asking. From her perspective, you have always said yes to her and your other kids when it comes to picking a restaurant so she may not even consider price and being told no for the first time was outside of the norm so very strange. Also sounds like she didn't pick it maliciously since you said she doesn't usually have expensive tastes. You are obviously not the AH for not wanting to drop a mortgage payment on a single meal, though hindsight says you should have put a price limit before. At least to teach her to pay attention to food prices so she's not a complete ahole adult when someone offers to treat her. Your sister received a one sided version of events and was pulled into this because her niece asked her to get involved.

Offer to pay for her meal there, and she can find a guest willing to spend the money, or she can dine alone. If you\u2019re really feeling generous her meal plus $150 toward her dining guest\u2019s meal.

She has an allowance, and we've talked to her about long-term savings (for things like college or a car), short-term savings (for things like a TV for her bedroom), and fun money (for splurges like eating out or buying a new game). And we have given her age-appropriate views into our own finance and the way we prioritize the same: necessities first (food, shelter, clothing, etc.), savings second (our retirement and their educational funds), and luxuries third (vacations, entertainment, gifts, dining out).\n\nShe's been exposed to this in age-appropriate ways for years. I don't think she's unaware of what $1500+ for a dinner means. That's part of why I'm so befuddled.", "Generalised promises often have implied praemisses. For example, I presume OP lives in the USA, is it within the scope of the promise to choose the L\u00b4Ambroisie in Paris to name a far away place where I would find it difficult to leave without spending 500 USD per person. To fullfill the promise OP would have to buy flights and accommodation and so forth. So in such a situation \"within means and reason\" needs to be assumed.   \nTo make another example: if your ex-partner promised they would always bring out your trash, this is of course under a whole bunch of implied praemisses: Being a couple, maybe living together etc. You would not expect them 5 years after the breakup and after they moved 2k km away to bring out your trash?   \nI went at that age to such places very rarely with my parents and it was a rapture every single time and some of my fondest adolescence memories with my parents.", "That\u2019s a shitty thing to do. That\u2019s not keeping the promise, because it\u2019s putting a condition on it after the fact.", "1. You\u2019re playing the semantic game. \n2.  OP explicitly says they could pick any restaurant.\n3.  How is her ask unreasonable when she was told \u201cany restaurant\u201d?? Besides, they already have $1000 budget. This is $1500. It\u2019s not outrageous.", "It'd still be a couple hundred more than budgeted, but possible. I would, however, feel very weird essentially saying to my son \"you're not invited to what has always been a family nice-dinner-out because I have to spend $750 on your sister,\" though.", "I don\u2019t think there was a miscommunication. OP quite clearly said \u201cany place you want.\u201d", "I disagree that the parents also suck here. They\u2019re doing a nice thing for their kids that the daughter is taking for granted. She\u2019s way too old to not understand boundaries and being reasonable.", "This isn't the kind of place that has cheaper days or times--it doesn't have to; the waiting list is weeks out. \n\nI'd just have one of us take my daughter, but uninviting my son from what has always been a family thing feels... I don't know. Odd? I can't just send both of them; under-18 requires at least one person over 18 in attendance.", "We can swing it, but the extra $1000+ would be coming out of the general vacation/entertainment/gift budget for the rest of the year. Which, of course, affects my son as well.", "That's an excellent point generally, but this is the equivalent of a Michelin-star restaurant in our area--they don't do cheap days because they don't have to. They're booked solid for months at their regular rates.", "RIGHT!? lol! The sister input was just unnecessary and not understanding at all.", "Maybe, the \"I can't trust you guys anymore\" can either be an act of being spoiled or maybe something else is going on. But to be fair we are kinda assuming off of 5 paragraphs and one singular view. But as the Dad/Mom I would ask why going their is so important, maybe get some kind of explanation.", "The thing I haven\u2019t seen yet in any of these comments is - what if it is really important to her to eat at this restaurant? Why? I\u2019m not saying that you have to give in and blow your vacation budget for the year. You\u2019re clearly NTA and \u201cno\u201d is the right answer here. But, despite the fact that she generally gets the concept of money and budgets, she\u2019s really upset about this \u201cno.\u201d Why? If you can talk to her about why this specific restaurant is important to her, maybe you can figure out a way to get her needs met. Can she skip her end-of-year meal this year, put the money aside, and then save throughout the coming year to have that be her big meal next year? She\u2019s old enough to get a job, if she can save up $500, and you can save $500 from this year\u2019s dinner, then use the $500 budgeted for next year\u2019s dinner to afford the meal? I guess I\u2019m just saying, find out what\u2019s going on here for her, and then involve her in the thinking and planning and sacrifice involved in getting an extravagant thing that you really really want. Maybe she\u2019s a future Top Chef, who knows!", "Yes, I completely get this. But she is 15 though and may have not fully grasped this yet.", "It\u2019s not a condition, it\u2019s the reality of the situation. OP can\u2019t magically make more money appear in his budget.", "I accept your judgment, but for clarity, the $1000 budget was for both my son and my daughter ($500 for each child's meal, more or less, which is what $100/head plus tax and tip amounts to). My daughter's restaurant alone would be more than $1500. My son has not chosen his restaurant yet. If he were to decide he also wanted the $300/person restaurant, we'd be at $3000+.", "While the boundaries weren\u2019t explicitly stated, when told no, and the reason is explained to her, she should\u2019ve acknowledged it and said \u201cthat\u2019s okay, maybe another time\u201d\n\nSo when told WHY her ask is unreasonable, she should have a mature enough understanding and be able to respond in a better way. Not throwing a tantrum to auntie to come and save her", "$1500 for dinner is outrageous. $50 to $60 and possibly $100 per person is reasonable for a special occasion, $300 per person is 5x the amount they previously spent, so there\u2019s no reason that the daughter should think that\u2019s reasonable.", "Doesn\u2019t your son get to pick his own dinner too though? So you could do a 1:1 with each of them. Just a thought.\n\nEdit: not sure why this is getting downvoted? It was just one suggestion that OP could take or leave.", "Whoa\u2026weeks out for a waiting list. That\u2019s crazy! \n\nThat\u2019s a good point for not inviting your son. And I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t like that either! Maybe have this restaurant as a different special occasion..? Like\u2026graduating high school? That way it\u2019s scheduled\u2026it\u2019s not a no nor a yes\u2026and you have time to plan it\u2026?", "I would encourage her to find a way to make up the difference herself between normal budget and the cost. Otherwise, sorry, it\u2019s a no. \n\nFamily rules don\u2019t need to be lawyer written to cover every single case or circumstance. It is expected that common sense and decency will be applied.", "She\u2019s 15, not 5. She\u2019s old enough to understand", "He\u2019s better off just not taking them, or at least give them the option. But don\u2019t act like he\u2019s keeping the promise, when he\u2019s not. Also, he can afford it, but he doesn\u2019t want to.", "OK, I accept that it\u2019s double what you have spent in the past. So what? Don\u2019t you think you should\u2019ve done your due diligence to research restaurants in the area? Or taken five seconds to set a reasonable limit? Had you done either these things, this could\u2019ve been avoided. \n\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019re making an excuse:\n\n1.  \u201cWhatever restaurant restaurant they want.\u201d\n\n2.  \u201cOrder what they want.\u201d\n\n3.  \u201cEverything from a banana split\u2026to a steakhouse, to omakase\u2026\u201d \n\n4. \u201cWe\u2019ve never put restrictions on it except {distance }.\u201d\n\nEverything in her experience supports the idea that she could eat literally any place she wants, as long as it\u2019s within an hour\u2019s drive.  She found a place that met the one requirement you imposed and so she is expecting to eat there.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford it, then nix the restaurant and take your L.  Tell your daughter that you wrote a check your account can\u2019t cash. Teach her a lesson on making promises as well as not making assumptions; and most importantly, establishing clear communication.", "Yes they were. The only restriction was that it had to be within an hour drive. Everything else was on the table, pardon the pun lol. He made it a point to tell them they could go to any restaurant and order anything off the menu. He\u2019s taken them to the steak houses, and Omakase sushi, which is quite expensive.\n\nEverything in her previous experience led up to the reasonable expectation that she could eat at this restaurant. He has every right to nix the restaurant, but he still an AH.", "OP wanted to act like the big man and told them they could eat at literally any restaurant and order literally anything they want. \nInsert against that backdrop, the $1500 is not outrageous. OP fucked up. Also, it was stupid. For him, there\u2019s no upside, only downside.", "Sure. If what they want is to turn this from a family celebration to a high-end one-on-one experience, we can do that. I can offer that to both of them.", "It's only weeks out right now because they're still recovering from covid-related stuff. It used to be months of waiting list, pre-pandemic. \n\nIt's not Michelin-starred, but think Michelin-starred in terms of what kind of restaurant this is, re: expense, food, service, and demand. It's not dissimilar to French Laundry or comparable places.", "I'm a woman, as I made clear in the initial post.\n\nNormally I don't make a big deal about people misgendering me because of their heteronormative assumptions, but given that you are giving me no benefit of the doubt, I'm going to do the same and just go ahead and say that it's homophobic to glide right over my gender and assume I'm a man because I have children with a wife.", "Wow\u2026this place must be the rave! I kinda wanna know what the restaurant is now lol.", "You\u2019re welcome I think what you like, I don\u2019t care. I completely overlooked your gender. But I guess no one\u2018s ever made a mistake and overlooked a minor detail on Reddit before. You jumped right to a very strong allegation of homophobia. It has no relevance to the story. I don\u2019t give a shit who people date, marry, or have sex with. Sorry that you\u2019re offended?"]}
