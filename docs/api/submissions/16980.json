They each pick whatever restaurant they want for us all to go to, and order what they want. Over the years this has meant everything from \"banana split for dinner\" to a steakhouse to omakase to hand-pulled noodles. We've never put restrictions on it except it has to be within an hour's drive each way.\n\nYesterday, my daughter came to us with her choice, and I was caught completely off guard by her selection. It's an \\*extremely\\* high end restaurant that costs $315/person. That's a set tasting menu, so there's no way to, e.g., let the kids order something expensive and my wife and I order the cheapest thing. (I checked whether they had age restrictions and they permit guests over 13.) With tax, tip, and parking, it'd be north of $1500. This restaurant is an extreme outlier for our city, which is why it caught me so off-guard. Even the fancy steakhouses here only run $100/person even if you order a nice steak, an appetizer for the table, and desserts. We've certainly let the kids pick expensive restaurants before, but prior to this the most expensive things they've ordered were a $55 ribeye or a $60 omakase; we generally budget around $1000 total for both meals, and anything left over goes into the family vacation fund.\n\nMy wife and I told her that it was out of our budget, and she got very upset and said that we had promised her \"any restaurant she wanted.\" Which is true, we did say that. And she said I was going back on my word. I said, quite honestly, that it never occurred to me that she could \\*find\\* a $300/head restaurant, let alone ask to go there, so it didn't occur to me to tell her that was off-limits. She got mad and said I was implying that she was being greedy. I said, \"I don't think you're greedy. I do think you're being unrealistic.\" She burst into tears and said she couldn't trust us anymore.\n\nMy wife and I are in agreement, but my sister (who is very close with my daughter) called to tell me that it's important to never break a promise to a child. I asked her if she would have anticipated being asked for dinner at the only $300/person restaurant in a five hour radius, and she said no, but that that's why she'd just never make promises to her children. She says I need to apologize and either take her (we can, technically, afford it if we make cuts to other \"fun\" budgets), or apologize and find a way to make it up to her.\n\nI want to note that my daughter is not generally a person who asks for expensive things. She has never demanded lavish gifts, she's pretty sensible about money generally speaking, and she's always shown gratitude for the advantages that we all have. I don't know where this came from--I did ask, and she just said that she wanted to try it and we promised.\n\nSo, AITA for saying \"no\" here?\n\nEDIT: Think French Laundry-ish for the restaurant type.", "created_utc": 1683821538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ertp2/aita_for_going_back_on_my_word_to_my_daughter/", "score": 500, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have been giving an inch and she\u2019s trying to take a mile. \n\nThis is like telling a kid you\u2019ll help buy them a car when they graduate, and they want a Lamborghini. That\u2019s just not realistic. \n\nIf the sister is so concerned you\u2019re going back on your word, then let her pay for you guys. $300 per person is nothing to scoff at, and that money could be better spent around the house or toward something usable long term.\n\nI\u2019d suggest setting a $100 budget per person going forward, and if the daughter wants to front the other $200 to go, then maybe take them that way.\n\nNTA; but set clearer expectations going forward.", "NTA\n\nYes keeping promises to your child is extremely important, however it needs to be within reason and possible. One thing that makes breaking promises to your child a very bad thing is that a lot of parents aren't upfront and honest about it and hope they end up forgetting. But in this case, you explained thoroughly to your daughter why it wasn't possible this time (she's 15 too so she's too old to throw a tantrum) You have kept your promise for all the other dinners in their lives, but this is definitely too much. \n\nThis is also a good lesson to teach kids that they can't *always* get what they want, promise or not. Unfortunately that's not how the world works and there are things out of our control and unexpected. You can try your best to find a compromise though. $1500 for a family meal is pretty ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\nOkay, I understand she is upset about this, they are 15-17 years and should know that $300 per person is A LOT of money for a restaurant. I do feel as though she is being very dramatic about this situation with the whole 'I cant trust you guys anymore.' simply bc you guys said no to the extremely expensive restaurant. \n\n**\"my sister (who is very close with my daughter) called to tell me that it's important to never break a promise to a child. I asked her if she would have anticipated being asked for dinner at the only $300/person restaurant in a five hour radius, and she said no,\"**\n\nI have issues with this for many reasons, your sister is feeding into your daughters tantrum. Even she herself said ''she wouldn't do it'', so she should understand the severity of that much money being spent on a single restaurant for one family meal.", "NTA. \n\nIf your sister wants your daughter to go so badly, she can take her herself. I won't hold my breath waiting for her offer to come through on that, though. \n\nNo, look, you guys obviously have learned a valuable lesson here for the future and I hope will be setting some sort of budget on this moving forward. But you're not the assholes for declining to pay for a dinner that costs more than a lot of vacations. \n\nAt 15, your daughter is more than old enough to understand that money doesn't grow on trees - your sister is acting like your daughter is a 5 year old who was promised an ice cream cone and didn't get one. That's not what this is, at all. \n\nYou explained the situation to your daughter and your sister, and that's really the end of the discussion. Your daughter can feel hurt - her reaction seems about in-line with what I'd expect from a teenager in this situation. But your sister needs to stop feeding into it unless she plans on taking your daughter herself, and as I said above, I won't hold my breath.", "NTA. It's out of your budget, simple as that. You weren't mean about it, just practical. Your sister has no dog in this fight...she isn't footing the bill here. She can just butt the hell out of it.\n\nThis is a really good opportunity for your daughter to learn about practical limitations and the impact of unreasonable requests.", "NTA Tell your sister to butt out and your daughter to stop trying to manipulate you.", "**NTA**   Now is a good time for your daughter to learn that her wanting something doesn't entitle her to bankrupt the family budget.  It doesn't seem that you have instilled any kind of money awareness in your kids.   Does she have chores and an allowance?   How long would it take for her to save 1K for a three person dinner.   Ask her why she would think it was okay.\n\nYour sister is a real AH.  Tell her to butt out and she can pay for the dinner herself.", "NTA, you'd be setting a precedent for future dinners if you follow through. They're getting older, so it's not just sundaes for dinner. It's prestige and gastronomy. They sound like smart kids.\n\nYou're a parent and allowed to say no. You're not a bad parent for saying no. You have higher callings (haha), college, cars, weddings, down deposits.\n\nE: word", "NTA\n\nI feel like you handled this well, and whether she\u2019s close or not, your sister has no right to comment either, that\u2019s nosey of her. \n\nAnd while your daughter is generally frugal or at least mindful, for her to get upset and not try to understand is also ridiculous. She needs to realize this will happen in the world all the time. Shit always falls through, so she\u2019s gonna be let down eventually", "NTA - I think that this would be a great opportunity to sit down with your kids and go over finances and budgeting. Discuss needs vs wants and how you have planned for this dinner. Let your kids know, that if they want to try this place, you could post-pone the dinner and put more money aside to do this.", "NTA. But this is a lesson learned to not make such generalized promises. You can pick any restaurant within a 1 hour drive and each year we'll decide on a budget, or something to that effect. \n\nBut I get where you are coming from. Who would've thought a 15yo would find let alone ask to go to a place that is 300 bucks per person. I've never even seen one. Then again, I live in a midwest town lol. And I bet you they have those tiny, bite-sized appetizers and dishes.", "NTA\n\nI think you should ask her more questions as to how she even found such a place, there's no way she just knew about it. She either saw it online or went to google searching via $$$$  \n\n\nTell her to find somewhere cheaper and going forward, put a limit on it", "NTA. $1500 for a dinner is insane. I'm sure if you asked her 10 years from now if she would drop that amount of money on a single meal she would laugh.", "NTA-   \nYour sister needs to butt out.   \nThis is a great time to teach your daughter about the phrase \"within reason.\"", "Just take them and tell them the vacation fund will be less because of this meal, and she can choose to dine there and have a minimalist vacation!", "NTA, \u201canything you want\u201d typically is referring to the food, not the price. As a teenager who is starting to learn the value of a dollar she should be understand that her ask was unreasonable.", "Rules are far and wide created to stop a problem that exists before the rule. Yeah, the rule changed because you abused it lol. NTA", "NTA, she is attempting to take advantage of your kindness. If your sister has so much to say she can chip in for the cost.", "NTA. My mom promised to take me on a trip when I graduated high school, but my family\u2019s financial circumstances changed and that was no longer feasible. I wasn\u2019t mad, that\u2019s just life. If your kid is really dead set on this, you could offer to take her but make clear that she\u2019s going to have to forego some other luxuries she\u2019s used for a while to make the budget work.", "What a tough one! I\u2019m going with NTA, because this was a completely unexpected blind sided outlier of a situation.", "NTA  \nSister saying she would just give up on making promises to children all together is a bit much and shows, to me, she doesn't maybe quite get it.  \nThis kind of thing is a very normal part of growing up, even in a really nice home. Your parents want the best for you but can't always provide everything you want. As long you're patient and apologetic with her, you're being very reasonable.  \nIt was an honest oversight on your part.", "NTA, I feel like  you and your daughter are in a difficult situation where expectations and realities are clashing.  I think that most of the time parents need to honor promises to their children, but sometimes circumstances arise that makes it difficult to fulfill those promises and that's okay.In this case, it's understandable that she's upset and disappointed, but it's also important to  remember that most 15y/o need guidance  when it comes to financial responsibility and budgeting.", "NTA\n\nTeenagers are difficult and you handled this well. You say it's out of nowhere and who knows, maybe she's been watching a lot of top chef. Either way a 15 year old isn't going to fully conceptualize what budgeting looks like. Set a price cap for this and the future, she'll probably sulk the whole meal this year but again, teenagers. I don't think it means a whole lot more than teens being teens if she's generally a good kid.", "NTA - it\u2019s not a reasonable request IMO. I would ask her to find another restaurant and maybe you could plan to try that restaurant for a different special occasion where you can save up for it. \nAnd for future things would put in a budget cap, but I get that it hasn\u2019t been needed till now.", "NTA. Your daughter is testing boundaries. This is a good opportunity to teach her that when someone else is paying for a meal, common courtesy and social etiquette dictate that it\u2019s an a-hole move to pick the most expensive restaurant just because you \u201ctechnically\u201d can, because you\u2019re not paying. Tell her that that kind of behavior will make people not want to do nice things for her.", "NTA. Your daughter made a ridiculous and unreasonable restaurant selection. My guess is for some sort of social media flex for her friends?", "INFO is it possible for just one parent and her to go alone to celebrate?", "\r  \nNavigating situations like these can be challenging, and it's important to consider the perspectives of everyone involved. In this case, it seems like there was a miscommunication regarding the expectations and boundaries for the restaurant selection. While it's understandable that you feel caught off guard by your daughter's choice, it's also important to acknowledge that you did make a promise to let each child pick any restaurant they wanted.\r  \n\r  \nIn this situation, I don't believe you are necessarily the asshole (NTA) for saying \"no.\" It's clear that the price of the restaurant exceeds what you had initially anticipated, and it's reasonable to express your concerns about the cost. However, it's crucial to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, as your daughter feels disappointed and her trust has been affected.\r  \n\r  \nTo resolve the situation, consider having an open and honest conversation with your daughter. Apologize for the miscommunication and explain that you underestimated the potential cost of the restaurant she chose. Engage in a dialogue with her about budget constraints and financial responsibilities, emphasizing the importance of finding a balance between treating oneself and being mindful of expenditures.\r  \n\r  \nYou can explore alternatives together, such as suggesting a compromise where you visit a less expensive but still enjoyable restaurant and plan another special outing in the future. By involving her in the decision-making process and ensuring her voice is heard, you can work towards rebuilding trust and finding a resolution that satisfies both parties.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, it's essential to foster open communication, understanding, and compromise within the family to navigate situations like these successfully.", "This is hard for me to judge. I think in the end, YTA.  You made a promise. We teach our children to keep their word and not make excuses. There is no reason why you couldn\u2019t have researched this yourself, since your daughter was able to do it. You made an assumption that there wouldn\u2019t be a restaurant that exceeded your limit. So, yes; I\u2019m going with YTA. Don\u2019t make a promise if you can\u2019t keep it. Listen to your sister\ud83d\ude42", "ESH. Your daughter has taken you at your word regarding any restaurant.\n\nCompletely understand that it might be an outlier but a caveat of \u2018within reason\u2019 at the time of the statement could have avoided this. Your daughters reaction is a bit ott at the same time.\n\nIf it\u2019s not possible to go to this place this year, is it something that as a family you can \u2018save up\u2019 for over the next year or so (including contributions from your son and daughter) to be able to treat you all, but still also go somewhere different this year as well? \n\nPerhaps explain to your daughter that the cost of the restaurant is too high as a lump sum without budgeting for it in advance.", "As kids grow up, they want to take more risks. Bigger and more expensive restaurants are to be expected - especially for a meal that's a once-a-year Mega Treat.\n\nLook, I can see why you flinched. Dropping $1500 on dinner? Yikes. That's nuking the family vacation over a couple plates of food.\n\nBut you've never flinched at a price tag before. And, from your description, it doesn't sound like your daughter wasn't told that there was a price cap. Just that the restaurant is her choice.\n\nIf I was your daughter, and I saw that chef-personalized sushi was on the table, I wouldn't have thought a $300-a-head restaurant was a problem.\n\nIt's a close one, but I'm going to have to give this a very gentle YTA instead of the N A H I was originally planning. After the age of 13, both of your kids should have known what the secret 'rules' to this present were.\n\nSit her down - with your son, your wife, and the sister who is calling you a rule breaker - and show her the inner workings of your deal. Then decide as a family what you want to do.\n\nAs a teenager, who will have to make and follow her own budget in a couple years, I'm sure it will be a great learning experience for her.", "YTA\n\nCmon you say you can afford it so go. Or if you truly cant afford it then just have her go with 1 friend or alone\u2026\n\nIts a one time thing. You did promise her without any restrictions now you are trying to go back on your word", "This one\u2019s hard\u2026and I only say that because you should\u2019ve known that when the kids get older, their taste palate and wanted experiences would change. A 10 year old requesting their favorite meal can be drastically different then a 15/17 year old requesting their favorite/new meal to try. Everyone\u2019s taste palate changes as we age, so \u201crules and implications\u201d probably should\u2019ve been thought of way back when. \n\nOverall, I think there can be a compromise. Maybe the whole family doesn\u2019t need to go? Maybe this restaurant has \u201ccheaper days/hours\u201d where if you go at a certain time the price per person is dropped (sorta like a buffet)?

Seems like your daughter has no real frame of reference for her limitations when asking. From her perspective, you have always said yes to her and your other kids when it comes to picking a restaurant so she may not even consider price and being told no for the first time was outside of the norm so very strange. Also sounds like she didn't pick it maliciously since you said she doesn't usually have expensive tastes. You are obviously not the AH for not wanting to drop a mortgage payment on a single meal, though hindsight says you should have put a price limit before. At least to teach her to pay attention to food prices so she's not a complete ahole adult when someone offers to treat her. Your sister received a one sided version of events and was pulled into this because her niece asked her to get involved.

Offer to pay for her meal there, and she can find a guest willing to spend the money, or she can dine alone. If you\u2019re really feeling generous her meal plus $150 toward her dining guest\u2019s meal.

She has an allowance, and we've talked to her about long-term savings (for things like college or a car), short-term savings (for things like a TV for her bedroom), and fun money (for splurges like eating out or buying a new game). And we have given her age-appropriate views into our own finance and the way we prioritize the same: necessities first (food, shelter, clothing, etc.), savings second (our retirement and their educational funds), and luxuries third (vacations, entertainment, gifts, dining out).\n\nShe's been exposed to this in age-appropriate ways for years.

Perhaps she wants to try something elegant... again, something you can do at home or perhaps this place has a lunch that is less expensive.\n\nShe's NTA for asking (though throwing a tantrum edges into that area) and you are NTA for not indulging her in this.\n\nAsk if she truly believes that you are now untrustworthy. You may have to cease promising your children things or adding caveats. ETA: Or discussing about the 'invisible footnote' as mentioned below or asking if it is fair.  Together read *The Necklace* by Guy de Maupassant.\n\nETA: See if you can hire on a one-meal basis, a chef-in-training from a nearby cooking school to replicate the menu.", "NTA I would ask why it\u2019s important to her what made her choose that restaurant. This doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll change your mind but give insight. Maybe she wants to be a chef? Maybe she just thought it was cool and didn\u2019t realize it was out of budget. You mentioned those places aren\u2019t usually in your area so maybe that\u2019s why. I would also explain why that\u2019s out of budget. If y\u2019all were to make it happen that means she would get a less for Christmas or birthday or whatever. Also if your sister thinks this is a must then tell her to pitch in \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, she's plenty old enough to know that her selection is outside the realm of possibility for the vast majority of people and certainly isn't appropriate for a teenager to demand of her parents!\n\nThe \"never break a promise\" and \"broken trust\" lines are nothing more than manipulation on both your daughter and sister's parts, and it doesn't really matter if they don't see it that way!", "NTA. But if it's a set tasting menu have you considering sending her on her own, or just with her brother.", "Tell your sister to mind her own business. Never making promises to your kids is no better than rarely breaking one. Your daughter\u2019s request is unreasonable. She can choose another restaurant or go to the fancy one on her own dime when she saves up for it. \n\nNTA", "NTA. any place within reason.  Tell her that unless she wants to miss out on something you would need to save up for, $300 per person is not doable.", "NTA. Man, my parents would have just laughed at me if I had suggested a place that was $300/a person.  It's hard enough getting my dad to get fast food!  Lol", "There is no need to apologize and your daughter is using buzz words to guilt you. Her little dramatic \"I can't trust you anymore!!\"? Yeah, no. That's BS. She is taking advantage, she knows she's taking advantage.\n\nTurn her down and feel zero guilt.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nShe is being ridiculous. Your sister is the AH for encouraging her to be upset about not going to this ridiculously expensive restaurant.", "NTA. Your sister is an idiot. You don't need to take her for a 300 dollar tasting menu. Daughter is being both greedy and unrealistic. Tell her she can pick something in the appropriate range or not go. Does the she think money grows on trees. Might be time for her to learn some responsibility and get a job with that attitude. Maybe she needs to start buying her own clothes. I'd escalate. And tell her she better start being thankful because it could go the other way fast if she keeps pushing.", "NTA\n\nYou promised a dinner within an hour of their choosing, you did NOT promise an exorbitantly expensive dinner - I think it goes without saying, but when people offer you dinner, you don't get the most expensive thing on the menu or go to the most expensive restaurant as a courtesy; this is typical of manners when you are invited out to eat, so I'm quite miffed your daughter made such a request. So you may need to clarify this with her. \n\n It is also a kind of restaurant where you cannot have alterations or skip certain aspects. It's a very boogey restaurant, and if anything, this restaurant is something that not only requires dressing very smart, but also acting very smart. The portions will also likely be exceedingly small, and it is a \"experience\" style dinner - certain things have to be eaten a certain way. This is likely meant for foodies and connoisseurs. \n\nThis is the kind of dinner you take someone if they graduated from medical school or something. But a 17 and 15 year old? No. Not entirely appropriate.  It also pulls money from everyone else in the household - so everyone else would have to agree to go, and that means setting the expectations of how to behave, dress, etc. from the get go.\n\nI think best offer you can make is either everyone wants to try it or no one goes. Why? Because if the experience is fun, then someone will feel left out or resentful they chose not to merely because of the expense. If as a family you cannot justify the expense, then it shouldn't be made. There are far better things that you could do with that money as a family then on a solo parent-kid date. If you try and take your daughter with just one parent, and it is expensive, then that might pull money from other things that might necessarily require your whole family sit out on (Aka: family vacation - that $600 could have been the difference of going to X place and doing Y thing). \n\nPerhaps it is time you taught your daughter the value of money, and what everyone in the household will have to forgo if you go to this restaurant. While it may not make a huge impact, it could be felt down the line if there is limitations of what things you could enjoy later.", "NTA.  Explain how much money that is to your daughter.  At her age level, explain your bills, and how the dinner she has chosen would negatively effect the rest of the family for months.  If you want to offer the \"reduce the other fun stuff\" suggestion to do it, give her a list of all the things that WILL NOT happen if the family eats there.  This is a tough one and giving her as many details as are age appropriate would go a long way.", "NTA she is *absolutely* old enough to understand \u201csorry honey, but now that you guys are moving away from (kid restaurant), the budget for each dinner is $500. Let\u2019s look up other places.\u201d", "NTA but I would give her some \"adult\" choices here. Explain that you can only afford this if other budgets are cut and ask if she wants the excess money to come out of future spending on her, or if she would prefer a different restaurant.", "NTA. As you have mentioned the place has a waiting list essentially- its fully booked for the next couple months. Did you daughter think you would be able to just waltz in? Perhaps she would like to save up some money while you wait for a table in the fall to help cover the cost?", "NTA, your sister should stay out of this and this is a great opportunity for you to teach your daughter about being realistic.", "If you told your daughter she could have any pet she wanted and she choose a fox would there still be such hesitation? Domesticated foxes are legal some places but cost between 10-15k. Wouldn\u2019t you tell her that\u2019s unreasonable?\n\nShe needs to learn to be realistic. And your sister is right/wrong. No you shouldn\u2019t break promises to kids, if you can help it. Yes she\u2019s right you shouldn\u2019t make promises, especially like this. But no, she is not correct you should give in.\n\nESH", "My guess is she's trying to one-up some brat at school.", "Oooooooh sneaky.", "Does your daughter understand that? That even if you ok going to the this place, that the reservation you call immediately to book will be in the next available time slot in OCTOBER?", "this is also a really good point. I agree it's NTA, and I think there's a lot of valuable lessons here (God I sound old). \n\n if OP's daughter isn't usually the type to push it about things like this, I wonder if maybe she's just really into food? or saw some crazy fine dining experience on tiktok and really wanted to experience something like that? it could be a good opportunity for her to figure out ways to put the funds together so that she can do that, if it's something she's genuinely interested in. I think that while \"no we can't do that\" is totally reasonable, it might be more useful to say \"if this is an interest of yours you really want to explore, let's look into what babysitting/petsitting/lawn mowing/whatever else options might be available in the area\" so that she still feels like she has the ability to pursue that", "Here\u2019s a thought then. If your daughter genuinely wants to eat there, offer to take her as a mother- daughter night as long as she\u2019s willing to split the cost with you.", "I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s told friends that she\u2019s going to the $300/person place and dreads being found out when it doesn\u2019t happen. Learning early in life to avoid this kind of situation will pay off later but I I\u2019m sure it hurts right now. NTA, OP, but I feel for all of you because I once was that girl.", "Agree - she\u2019s probably told friends that she\u2019s going there for dinner and dreads the embarrassment of not following through. Which is also a good lesson to learn early in life.", "Might also be easier if it\u2019s a mother/father daughter thing. If the kid only has to raise money for 2 people it will take less time.  And be a good parent/child bonding experience.", "So, total speculation, but does your daughter by any chance have wealthier friends who may have gone to this place and bragged about it? I ask because I grew up in a reasonably well-off family, but many of my classmates were much wealthier\u2014and at that age, the pressure to keep up with the rich kids can be pretty compelling. \n\nAnyway, NTA. Good life lesson as other have said.", "I think a better learning experience for her daughter is to learn that all offers of gifts or hospitality should be accepted with gratitude and reasonableness. Letting it become a family discussion teaches her daughter that she can ask beyond appropriateness. Not a great lesson.", "I had a similar thought -- what if you present her the option to go, just her and one of her parents, and that means she'll have a smaller Christmas/birthday present budget this year?\n\nIt seems unfair to her sibling to take on a financial commitment that means EVERYONE eats the cost in the future for this dinner, but it may be a valuable lesson in having to sacrifice for what you want.  Like I won't give you an outright no, but you need to decide if trying this restaurant is worth opening half of the presents your sibling will get this Christmas.", "It\u2019s hard for me to see how this could be presented to the son in a way that wouldn\u2019t pressure him one way or another\u2014whether it\u2019s to agree to skip the family dinner, to do something cheaper himself, to count her dinner as his too, etc. It puts him in an awkward situation to have to say \u201cI want to be part of my sister\u2019s expensive meal and I also want a meal of my own choice.\u201d He will probably say \u201csure, whatever\u201d whether he actually is okay with sister getting a vastly more luxurious choice or not.\n\nEDIT: I think this is also true of the \u201cdiscuss whether you want to have a very expensive meal and then a cheaper vacation\u201d plan. It requires the brother to be the bad guy and say \u201csorry, sis, I don\u2019t want to cheap out on the vacation so we can have a tasting spoon full of duck broth.\u201d He shouldn\u2019t have to do that.", "I don\u2019t think it should be everybody, cause then you get the other kids resenting her. I think the consequences should be just for her Christmas etc", "That's a very good point. There's an ethics lesson in there too.", "Yes, tell her that if you do eat at this restaurant, it will be her birthday gift as well as her Christmas  gift. And there will be no argument about it later when she receives no/less expensive gifts on those occasions.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is old enough to understand implied limits. We frequently speak in absolute terms, when we don't actually mean to do so. It's simply shorter than trying to list every conceivable limitation, and it's common sense that any offer will likely have some kind of restriction. You're not breaking your word to your daughter. You're teaching her to set reasonable limits.", "Well, if she is very interested in keeping promises precisely and as worded, she could pick the restaurant \"for you all to go to\" 'and then once you have \"gone there\" she could \"order whatever she wanted\" while you went home.\nNot saying it's the best way to deal with it. It's the smartass teenager way to deal with it. Maybe you are more mature than she is. But if not ...", "NTA. What if she picked the most expensive restaurant in Paris. Would you be discussing booking a flight right now? Boundaries exist.", "If you can make the sacrifice, for the purpose of keeping to your word, then do so. It will sink into her the importance of keeping to promises as your sister said. I always do my best to adhere to my promises and that's why they are so few.\n\nI'm sure one of her friends recommended it and she'll now look bad in front of her friends. She might have told she'd be there and then this disappointment.", "NTA- this request is simply unreasonable. I agree with setting clear limits for the future and a gentle conversation about why we can\u2019t spend that much money on a dinner.", "NTA Wait 'til she starts that on dates. I'd love to see her face when her date says separate checks. She'll earn herself the usual name for her avaricious behavior.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t breaking your word if you tell her she ca go anywhere she wants as long as price per person is less than $x, you choose what amount x is.", "NTA but you did give her your word.\n\nMaybe you could ask her for a cheaper restaurant and then ask her what ln the menu of the fancy restaurant she wanted and if you can, take her to eat it.\n\nOr telling her \"look, I have a budget now of X dollar and it would cost about Y dollars to go. What about we both save this year to acquire the needed money\".\n\nOverall is a great learning experience, that you sometimes want and expected some things but reality and money usually put a stop to it.", "NTA just sit her down and have an honest conversation.  When you made the promise you assumed they would chose normal restaurants you guys go to currently.  Apologize but tell her you need to amend the process.  If she\u2019s a jerk then you can take it back.  People saying \u201eyou can\u2019t break a promise\u201c are ridiculous.  Not everyone words everything perfectly and she\u2019s trying to play you.  You can always amend a promise especially if they are taking advantage of you", "NTA. The kid is pushing it wanting to eat there. Yikes.", "NTA.\n\nThis might be a teaching moment. \"Daughter, if this is what you want, here is the trade off. To go to this restaurant, the following \"fun\" family activities will be sacrificed. No trips for ice cream, no pool days, no vacation, no extra money towards activities....\" Let her make the decision if this one meal is worth missing out on the rest of the Summer activities. When presented that way, most kids will rethink their choices and make better ones.", "NTA, even promises have limits.\n\nShe is being ridiculous and entitled.  I would tell your sister that she is welcome to take your daughter if she is so insistent on this.\n\nI would have a gentle chat with your daughter and ask her why she picked that particular restaurant, was someone talking about it at school, did she see it on social media.  its just an extreme amount of money to pay for a meal out.", "NTA \n\nShe's definitely bragging to her friends that she's doing this. \n\nSo, sit her down with the budget and show her every single thing that won't happen if you go through with it. Make sure you include birthday parties and gifts for friends' birthdays. \n\nGive her a week to think about it and then ask her if she wants to reconsider.", "I don\u2019t know if this will help.  But, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s embarrassed at making the suggestion and seeing your reaction and that\u2019s why she acted out.  I remember being about the same age and my parents promising to take me out anywhere I wanted if I made straight A\u2019s.  I did and I picked a doozy.  Our financial situation was unknown to me because I had everything I needed so I never thought about it!  I know now they barely made it.  Of course, I would have been mortified with embarrassment if my parents reacted like you did.  My parents didn\u2019t say no but said my choice sounded good but it will take a little while to save up the money and asked what I thought.  I said that we could go somewhere else now and then we can save up for this other place next time I made straight A\u2019s.  I said I would save my allowance money.  I felt like a grown up helping them solve a problem.  Maybe ask her to help you figure out how to make it happen.  She might surprise you.  By the way, it took a year, but I did make straight A\u2019s and we did go and I helped pay.  I love that memory.", "NTA\n\nBut would roll out the summer budget on the kitchen table and say this means no more going to the movies/burgers/shakes whatever it is. So she understands that she can have it but she needs to realize the impact on the family.", "NTA- I've heard of this happening, so sry.", "NTA I think she's been bragging to friends about this deal and built it up she's going to this really expensive dinner.", "NTA\n\nYou might sit everyone down and tell her that yes, if that's what she wants, you'll go to that restaurant. BUT, vacations this summer will have to be pared way down if not eliminated, as the dinner will take a chunk of change out of the vacation budget.", "Offer to give her the money to eat by herself and drop her off. The rest of you can eat somewhere else. If she takes it she is just being greedy & you haven't broken your promise.", "NTA. Whatever you decide, you would not be the asshole. If you are considering giving in to your daughter, I suggest laying out for her the impact to the fun budget. You may have promised any restaurant, but you did not say the expense would not impact other budget items (I'm assuming).\n\nSome other ideas: Tell her that the dinner is your budget for x years of end-of-year dinners, so you won't be taking her out again for an end-of-year dinner for x years. It could also be time to end the tradition.\n\nI am also wondering if you actually \"promised\" you would take her out like this every year. I can't imagine anyone saying, \" I promise, for the rest of your school life, I will take to you to any restaurant you choose and will buy you anything and everything you want from the restaurant. The sky is the limit!\" I would have expected this to be more of a tradition and offer that your daughter is trying to claim was an absolute promise.", "Many people have already comment on why you are NTA which i agree with but ill throw out some other ideas.\n\n1 you say she doesnt ask for expensive things. This might make her feel that shes been frugal and saved you from paying alot of money that now shes cashing in on a big purchase. One thing to look at is how much money you are spending on her vs your son while you shouldnt have to count pennies if he cost you 1k more than her over the last year then it might be fair to spend that on her. (Im using 500 as normal meal so 1500-500=1k over normal budget)\n\n2. You say you can afford it if you cut other fun budgets is there a way that you could cut her section of the fun budget out in order to make the difference in the next 3-6months or so? If so you could offer the restaurant in exchange for not going on other fun stuff. \n\n3.  15 is also the age when coming of age parties get thrown ie  quinceanera or sweet sixteen. Idk if you were gonna do one of these or how important of a tradition it is but this could also be part of the deal ie no sweet sixteen but you get to go to this restaurant.\n\n4   Another option is to see if your son would be amenable to go to this restaurant as his meal so instead of 2 you have one fancy one still overbudget but not nearly as much. This might include her doing his share of chores or something but that would be negotiated between the two of them. Not too sure if this one is a good idea or not.\n\nOverall if you can find a compromise it might end a bit better. \n\nAnother note is to make sure that she knows she is pushing the promise an unreasonable amount.", "Yeah and a compromise would be saying that she can choose literally any other restaurant. She\u2019s definitely just being dramatic about it as teenagers are won\u2019t to do.", "If you didn't read the post don't vote", "NTA", "Op just talk with her. If you are sure you taught her value of money it means something else if going on. \nJust ask her why she wants go go to this specific restaurant. Is it the menu, did her friends told her about going there, had a famous person went there (someone whom she admire)? \nJust remember whatever reason it is and however not significant it might be for you it\u2019s still valid for her. \nIf she knows that whatever is not spent goes to vacation, then discuss with her the plans for vacation this year and how going to the restaurant would restrict the budget for it. \nAlso she\u2019s not graduating next week (not sure where you live) so there is still some time. Show her what exactly would you have to cut off to make you afford going there. Probably some of her spending. Would she be willing to spend less if it means going there? \nGenerally most of the people here see one way. But it\u2019s not. You do have options before saying hard \u201cno\u201d. But most of them involve talking to the other person. She\u2019s old enough for this conversation. \nYou made a promise and now you\u2019re backing out without truly understanding the other side. Get her reason and work on something together", "Glad I found this response - I was going to say, if this is the only $300+ place then I would expect them to be constantly booked out. You compared them to French Laundry, which sells out of parties of 2-4 within seconds of the reservations being released (I'm still trying to get a reservation there at a sane time since it's a 2 hour drive for me lol)\n\nEven if money wasn't a problem, you're looking at a 4 hour commitment (up to 6 with travel), and chances are your best bets at a reservation would be late weekday nights. Logistically sounds pretty difficult...\n\nNgl as a foodie I'm very curious which place this is ahaha hope your daughter is able to check it out someday (maybe with saved allowance or a summer job)", "I did read it. I said I didn't have to. Work on your reading comprehension", "this is a good point that I have never considered before. Thank you.", "Reading comprehension has nothing to do with the way I read your comment. The way you worded it implied you didn't read it, which I still don't believe you did.", "I\u2019m instead wondering if she\u2019s been put up to it by friends. Like maybe she was talking about the dinner, how she can pick wherever she wants, and someone challenged her to go there. It\u2019s her reaction to being told no that makes me think this; either she is a budding foodie or she\u2019s concerned about losing face.\n\nIf she\u2019s genuinely interested in it then she should be able to talk about what appeals to her about it. And then they could work on a plan for her to be able to try it, but not as an end-of-year whole family dinner. But I\u2019d really like to know what the source of her interest is.", "I didn't imply anything.  You assumed I didn't read it. If I didn't read it I would have said I didn't read it. Use your brain. It isn't difficult to understand.", "And I think this is the exact conversation to have with your daughter. I don't know how much of your story she knows, but I think that it would be a good conversation piece to help her grow in her understanding of a world that she can't contextualize yet because it's not her experience. It also sounds as though she doesn't fully understand the idea of what money it's worth and what it would cost. It might be worth explaining what $1,500 means to your family of four - - how many hours do you and your wife have to work to earn that much? How many months of groceries, or other expenses does this cover? I grew up firmly middle class, leaning towards the upper part, and I wouldn't have dared to make the same choices your daughter did, but I also understood very clearly because my parents had been raised very poor what money meant. I think it is time for your daughter to have some of that enlightenment, and that she might willingly choose something else if she understood the choice she made.", "Or she was bragging that she gets to pick wherever she wants and someone told her about this place.", "Or even, this meal is your birthday and Christmas presents for the next year.", "That\u2019s a good compromise. I was also thinking \u201cmaybe instead of the whole family, let\u2019s make it just the two of us\u201d."]}
