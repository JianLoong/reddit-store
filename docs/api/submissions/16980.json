They each pick whatever restaurant they want for us all to go to, and order what they want. Over the years this has meant everything from \"banana split for dinner\" to a steakhouse to omakase to hand-pulled noodles. We've never put restrictions on it except it has to be within an hour's drive each way.\n\nYesterday, my daughter came to us with her choice, and I was caught completely off guard by her selection. It's an \\*extremely\\* high end restaurant that costs $315/person. That's a set tasting menu, so there's no way to, e.g., let the kids order something expensive and my wife and I order the cheapest thing. (I checked whether they had age restrictions and they permit guests over 13.) With tax, tip, and parking, it'd be north of $1500. This restaurant is an extreme outlier for our city, which is why it caught me so off-guard. Even the fancy steakhouses here only run $100/person even if you order a nice steak, an appetizer for the table, and desserts. We've certainly let the kids pick expensive restaurants before, but prior to this the most expensive things they've ordered were a $55 ribeye or a $60 omakase; we generally budget around $1000 total for both meals, and anything left over goes into the family vacation fund.\n\nMy wife and I told her that it was out of our budget, and she got very upset and said that we had promised her \"any restaurant she wanted.\" Which is true, we did say that. And she said I was going back on my word. I said, quite honestly, that it never occurred to me that she could \\*find\\* a $300/head restaurant, let alone ask to go there, so it didn't occur to me to tell her that was off-limits. She got mad and said I was implying that she was being greedy. I said, \"I don't think you're greedy. I do think you're being unrealistic.\" She burst into tears and said she couldn't trust us anymore.\n\nMy wife and I are in agreement, but my sister (who is very close with my daughter) called to tell me that it's important to never break a promise to a child. I asked her if she would have anticipated being asked for dinner at the only $300/person restaurant in a five hour radius, and she said no, but that that's why she'd just never make promises to her children. She says I need to apologize and either take her (we can, technically, afford it if we make cuts to other \"fun\" budgets), or apologize and find a way to make it up to her.\n\nI want to note that my daughter is not generally a person who asks for expensive things. She has never demanded lavish gifts, she's pretty sensible about money generally speaking, and she's always shown gratitude for the advantages that we all have. I don't know where this came from--I did ask, and she just said that she wanted to try it and we promised.\n\nSo, AITA for saying \"no\" here?\n\nEDIT: Think French Laundry-ish for the restaurant type.", "created_utc": 1683821538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ertp2/aita_for_going_back_on_my_word_to_my_daughter/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have been giving an inch and she\u2019s trying to take a mile. \n\nThis is like telling a kid you\u2019ll help buy them a car when they graduate, and they want a Lamborghini. That\u2019s just not realistic. \n\nIf the sister is so concerned you\u2019re going back on your word, then let her pay for you guys. $300 per person is nothing to scoff at, and that money could be better spent around the house or toward something usable long term.\n\nI\u2019d suggest setting a $100 budget per person going forward, and if the daughter wants to front the other $200 to go, then maybe take them that way.\n\nNTA; but set clearer expectations going forward.", "NTA\n\nYes keeping promises to your child is extremely important, however it needs to be within reason and possible. One thing that makes breaking promises to your child a very bad thing is that a lot of parents aren't upfront and honest about it and hope they end up forgetting. But in this case, you explained thoroughly to your daughter why it wasn't possible this time (she's 15 too so she's too old to throw a tantrum) You have kept your promise for all the other dinners in their lives, but this is definitely too much. \n\nThis is also a good lesson to teach kids that they can't *always* get what they want, promise or not. Unfortunately that's not how the world works and there are things out of our control and unexpected. You can try your best to find a compromise though. $1500 for a family meal is pretty ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\nOkay, I understand she is upset about this, they are 15-17 years and should know that $300 per person is A LOT of money for a restaurant. I do feel as though she is being very dramatic about this situation with the whole 'I cant trust you guys anymore.' simply bc you guys said no to the extremely expensive restaurant. \n\n**\"my sister (who is very close with my daughter) called to tell me that it's important to never break a promise to a child. I asked her if she would have anticipated being asked for dinner at the only $300/person restaurant in a five hour radius, and she said no,\"**\n\nI have issues with this for many reasons, your sister is feeding into your daughters tantrum. Even she herself said ''she wouldn't do it'', so she should understand the severity of that much money being spent on a single restaurant for one family meal.", "NTA. \n\nIf your sister wants your daughter to go so badly, she can take her herself. I won't hold my breath waiting for her offer to come through on that, though. \n\nNo, look, you guys obviously have learned a valuable lesson here for the future and I hope will be setting some sort of budget on this moving forward. But you're not the assholes for declining to pay for a dinner that costs more than a lot of vacations. \n\nAt 15, your daughter is more than old enough to understand that money doesn't grow on trees - your sister is acting like your daughter is a 5 year old who was promised an ice cream cone and didn't get one. That's not what this is, at all. \n\nYou explained the situation to your daughter and your sister, and that's really the end of the discussion. Your daughter can feel hurt - her reaction seems about in-line with what I'd expect from a teenager in this situation. But your sister needs to stop feeding into it unless she plans on taking your daughter herself, and as I said above, I won't hold my breath.", "NTA. It's out of your budget, simple as that. You weren't mean about it, just practical. Your sister has no dog in this fight...she isn't footing the bill here. She can just butt the hell out of it.\n\nThis is a really good opportunity for your daughter to learn about practical limitations and the impact of unreasonable requests.", "NTA Tell your sister to butt out and your daughter to stop trying to manipulate you.", "**NTA**   Now is a good time for your daughter to learn that her wanting something doesn't entitle her to bankrupt the family budget.  It doesn't seem that you have instilled any kind of money awareness in your kids.   Does she have chores and an allowance?   How long would it take for her to save 1K for a three person dinner.   Ask her why she would think it was okay.\n\nYour sister is a real AH.  Tell her to butt out and she can pay for the dinner herself.", "NTA, you'd be setting a precedent for future dinners if you follow through. They're getting older, so it's not just sundaes for dinner. It's prestige and gastronomy. They sound like smart kids.\n\nYou're a parent and allowed to say no. You're not a bad parent for saying no. You have higher callings (haha), college, cars, weddings, down deposits.\n\nE: word", "NTA\n\nI feel like you handled this well, and whether she\u2019s close or not, your sister has no right to comment either, that\u2019s nosey of her. \n\nAnd while your daughter is generally frugal or at least mindful, for her to get upset and not try to understand is also ridiculous. She needs to realize this will happen in the world all the time. Shit always falls through, so she\u2019s gonna be let down eventually", "NTA - I think that this would be a great opportunity to sit down with your kids and go over finances and budgeting. Discuss needs vs wants and how you have planned for this dinner. Let your kids know, that if they want to try this place, you could post-pone the dinner and put more money aside to do this.", "NTA. But this is a lesson learned to not make such generalized promises. You can pick any restaurant within a 1 hour drive and each year we'll decide on a budget, or something to that effect. \n\nBut I get where you are coming from. Who would've thought a 15yo would find let alone ask to go to a place that is 300 bucks per person. I've never even seen one. Then again, I live in a midwest town lol. And I bet you they have those tiny, bite-sized appetizers and dishes.", "NTA\n\nI think you should ask her more questions as to how she even found such a place, there's no way she just knew about it. She either saw it online or went to google searching via $$$$  \n\n\nTell her to find somewhere cheaper and going forward, put a limit on it", "NTA. $1500 for a dinner is insane. I'm sure if you asked her 10 years from now if she would drop that amount of money on a single meal she would laugh.", "NTA-   \nYour sister needs to butt out.   \nThis is a great time to teach your daughter about the phrase \"within reason.\"", "Just take them and tell them the vacation fund will be less because of this meal, and she can choose to dine there and have a minimalist vacation!", "NTA, \u201canything you want\u201d typically is referring to the food, not the price. As a teenager who is starting to learn the value of a dollar she should be understand that her ask was unreasonable.", "Rules are far and wide created to stop a problem that exists before the rule. Yeah, the rule changed because you abused it lol. NTA", "NTA, she is attempting to take advantage of your kindness. If your sister has so much to say she can chip in for the cost.", "NTA. My mom promised to take me on a trip when I graduated high school, but my family\u2019s financial circumstances changed and that was no longer feasible. I wasn\u2019t mad, that\u2019s just life. If your kid is really dead set on this, you could offer to take her but make clear that she\u2019s going to have to forego some other luxuries she\u2019s used for a while to make the budget work.", "What a tough one! I\u2019m going with NTA, because this was a completely unexpected blind sided outlier of a situation.", "NTA  \nSister saying she would just give up on making promises to children all together is a bit much and shows, to me, she doesn't maybe quite get it.  \nThis kind of thing is a very normal part of growing up, even in a really nice home. Your parents want the best for you but can't always provide everything you want. As long you're patient and apologetic with her, you're being very reasonable.  \nIt was an honest oversight on your part.", "NTA, I feel like  you and your daughter are in a difficult situation where expectations and realities are clashing.  I think that most of the time parents need to honor promises to their children, but sometimes circumstances arise that makes it difficult to fulfill those promises and that's okay.In this case, it's understandable that she's upset and disappointed, but it's also important to  remember that most 15y/o need guidance  when it comes to financial responsibility and budgeting.", "NTA\n\nTeenagers are difficult and you handled this well. You say it's out of nowhere and who knows, maybe she's been watching a lot of top chef. Either way a 15 year old isn't going to fully conceptualize what budgeting looks like. Set a price cap for this and the future, she'll probably sulk the whole meal this year but again, teenagers. I don't think it means a whole lot more than teens being teens if she's generally a good kid.", "NTA - it\u2019s not a reasonable request IMO. I would ask her to find another restaurant and maybe you could plan to try that restaurant for a different special occasion where you can save up for it. \nAnd for future things would put in a budget cap, but I get that it hasn\u2019t been needed till now.", "NTA. Your daughter is testing boundaries. This is a good opportunity to teach her that when someone else is paying for a meal, common courtesy and social etiquette dictate that it\u2019s an a-hole move to pick the most expensive restaurant just because you \u201ctechnically\u201d can, because you\u2019re not paying. Tell her that that kind of behavior will make people not want to do nice things for her.", "NTA. Your daughter made a ridiculous and unreasonable restaurant selection. My guess is for some sort of social media flex for her friends?", "INFO is it possible for just one parent and her to go alone to celebrate?", "\r  \nNavigating situations like these can be challenging, and it's important to consider the perspectives of everyone involved. In this case, it seems like there was a miscommunication regarding the expectations and boundaries for the restaurant selection. While it's understandable that you feel caught off guard by your daughter's choice, it's also important to acknowledge that you did make a promise to let each child pick any restaurant they wanted.\r  \n\r  \nIn this situation, I don't believe you are necessarily the asshole (NTA) for saying \"no.\" It's clear that the price of the restaurant exceeds what you had initially anticipated, and it's reasonable to express your concerns about the cost. However, it's crucial to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, as your daughter feels disappointed and her trust has been affected.\r  \n\r  \nTo resolve the situation, consider having an open and honest conversation with your daughter. Apologize for the miscommunication and explain that you underestimated the potential cost of the restaurant she chose. Engage in a dialogue with her about budget constraints and financial responsibilities, emphasizing the importance of finding a balance between treating oneself and being mindful of expenditures.\r  \n\r  \nYou can explore alternatives together, such as suggesting a compromise where you visit a less expensive but still enjoyable restaurant and plan another special outing in the future. By involving her in the decision-making process and ensuring her voice is heard, you can work towards rebuilding trust and finding a resolution that satisfies both parties.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, it's essential to foster open communication, understanding, and compromise within the family to navigate situations like these successfully.", "This is hard for me to judge. I think in the end, YTA.  You made a promise. We teach our children to keep their word and not make excuses. There is no reason why you couldn\u2019t have researched this yourself, since your daughter was able to do it. You made an assumption that there wouldn\u2019t be a restaurant that exceeded your limit. So, yes; I\u2019m going with YTA. Don\u2019t make a promise if you can\u2019t keep it. Listen to your sister\ud83d\ude42", "ESH. Your daughter has taken you at your word regarding any restaurant.\n\nCompletely understand that it might be an outlier but a caveat of \u2018within reason\u2019 at the time of the statement could have avoided this. Your daughters reaction is a bit ott at the same time.\n\nIf it\u2019s not possible to go to this place this year, is it something that as a family you can \u2018save up\u2019 for over the next year or so (including contributions from your son and daughter) to be able to treat you all, but still also go somewhere different this year as well? \n\nPerhaps explain to your daughter that the cost of the restaurant is too high as a lump sum without budgeting for it in advance.", "As kids grow up, they want to take more risks. Bigger and more expensive restaurants are to be expected - especially for a meal that's a once-a-year Mega Treat.\n\nLook, I can see why you flinched. Dropping $1500 on dinner? Yikes. That's nuking the family vacation over a couple plates of food.\n\nBut you've never flinched at a price tag before. And, from your description, it doesn't sound like your daughter wasn't told that there was a price cap. Just that the restaurant is her choice.\n\nIf I was your daughter, and I saw that chef-personalized sushi was on the table, I wouldn't have thought a $300-a-head restaurant was a problem.\n\nIt's a close one, but I'm going to have to give this a very gentle YTA instead of the N A H I was originally planning. After the age of 13, both of your kids should have known what the secret 'rules' to this present were.\n\nSit her down - with your son, your wife, and the sister who is calling you a rule breaker - and show her the inner workings of your deal. Then decide as a family what you want to do.\n\nAs a teenager, who will have to make and follow her own budget in a couple years, I'm sure it will be a great learning experience for her.", "YTA\n\nCmon you say you can afford it so go. Or if you truly cant afford it then just have her go with 1 friend or alone\u2026\n\nIts a one time thing. You did promise her without any restrictions now you are trying to go back on your word", "This one\u2019s hard\u2026and I only say that because you should\u2019ve known that when the kids get older, their taste palate and wanted experiences would change. A 10 year old requesting their favorite meal can be drastically different then a 15/17 year old requesting their favorite/new meal to try. Everyone\u2019s taste palate changes as we age, so \u201crules and implications\u201d probably should\u2019ve been thought of way back when. \n\nOverall, I think there can be a compromise. Maybe the whole family doesn\u2019t need to go? Maybe this restaurant has \u201ccheaper days/hours\u201d where if you go at a certain time the price per person is dropped (sorta like a buffet)?

Seems like your daughter has no real frame of reference for her limitations when asking. From her perspective, you have always said yes to her and your other kids when it comes to picking a restaurant so she may not even consider price and being told no for the first time was outside of the norm so very strange. Also sounds like she didn't pick it maliciously since you said she doesn't usually have expensive tastes. You are obviously not the AH for not wanting to drop a mortgage payment on a single meal, though hindsight says you should have put a price limit before. At least to teach her to pay attention to food prices so she's not a complete ahole adult when someone offers to treat her. Your sister received a one sided version of events and was pulled into this because her niece asked her to get involved.

Offer to pay for her meal there, and she can find a guest willing to spend the money, or she can dine alone. If you\u2019re really feeling generous her meal plus $150 toward her dining guest\u2019s meal.

She has an allowance, and we've talked to her about long-term savings (for things like college or a car), short-term savings (for things like a TV for her bedroom), and fun money (for splurges like eating out or buying a new game). And we have given her age-appropriate views into our own finance and the way we prioritize the same: necessities first (food, shelter, clothing, etc.), savings second (our retirement and their educational funds), and luxuries third (vacations, entertainment, gifts, dining out).\n\nShe's been exposed to this in age-appropriate ways for years.

I'm honestly more confused than anything as to why she felt like $1500+ for a single ordinary family event was reasonable. Which is why I asked if I was TAH.", "If daughter is not ah then quit being a coward and say YTA.", "Or or...hear me out- the daughter listens to her father and understands that $1500 for 4 people to have dinner is NOT affordable by their family. She is 15 not 4. \n\nHaving some people go and not others is no longer the family dinner and experience they share.", ">You made a promise. We teach our children to keep their word and not make excuses\n\n\n\nNonsense. \nHave you kept every single 'word' of yours in all circumstances? \n\nHow do you justify a family spending money what will hurt them until year end, on a single dinner because Op isn't keeping his word in this context? \n\nDaughter needs a wake up call. Op can show her how this will hurt them but ultimately, he vetoes this. She is 15. This is a learning opportunity. The 'word' should change where $1500 on a single dinner is concerned for a family that cannot reasonably afford it. \n\n\nWhat noise is this not keeping word?", "I like a lot of your ideas, but they can't go this year on their own. While the place allows 13+ people to attend, you need someone 18+ with you if you're a minor. But I like the idea of suggesting that for next year when my son graduates and is 18 (if he wants it, of course).", "I mean in general NTA for sure, but this is an additional really great point. The spirit of the law over the letter of the law.", "I think you're probably right. It didn't occur to me because this is literally three times more than anything we've ever looked at before--when nobody had expressed interest in a place with a top menu item more than $80 (and indeed, you'd have to go looking for a restaurant with a higher limit than that), it simply didn't occur to me to say \"$100 is your limit.\" It was just a shock.\n\nI suppose the comparison I would make is that when I was a lower middle class kid, my parents would let me loose in a bookstore for my birthday and say \"you can buy any book you want.\" That meant that the $35 hardback wasn't off-limits (whereas normally we bought $5 mass market paperbacks at best, and usually from used bookstores), but I took it as granted that the $300 limited edition behind the glass case was off-limits without being told. I think I assumed my daughter had the same assumptions, but she clearly didn't, and that's on me.", "NTA and I'd bet you money she's fallen into some social media or something adjacent and this is about \"keeping up with the Jones'\"--either some influencer or celebrity is likely driving this, especially if this restaurant is notable (and w/ those prices, it likely is). Or she has VERY rich friends at school. \n\nMaybe the next financial lesson (that blew my mind when I was younger) which is that aside from the actual mega-rich, a LOT of people fund their lifestyles that they flaunt on credit cards, and are largely in debt. Made me feel better about not having as much when I was younger, as my mom taught me NOT to carry any CC debt and to only budget and buy things I could actually afford...", "Don't worry, sometimes 15 year olds are too stuborn to understand those things. I don't think that you or your daughter are bad people, you are trying your best to do something nice for her and she's just a teen.\n\nMaybe this could be a good learning moment for her.", "Oooo you're all over this post lol! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2764", "You\u2019re being obtuse.", "I feel like something else has to be going on here then... have you tried to sit down and talk to her about why she thought that would be okay, and asked if something else is bothering her?", "I have not always kept my promises; and when I didn\u2019t, it made me an AH and I had to apologize. I didn\u2019t double down and turn it around on the other person I made the promise to. \n\nSo, not \u201cnonsense\u201d at all, except to people who don\u2019t keep their promises :)", "Sadly that makes sense but I was hoping you might catch a break.", "I had wondered if that would be an issue for the ages. \n\nFingers crossed postponing to next year works out for y\u2019all.", "I wonder of she told someone that she's trying to impress that she's going there.", "yeah, I don\u2019t want to make any presumptions but it sounds like you\u2019re decently comfortable financially (which is what we all want right? to grow up and give our children a good life. congrats on doing that for your kids!), and that a consequence of that is that they just don\u2019t have that sort of internal qualifier of \u201cwithin reason\u201d being attached to \u201cwhatever you want\u201d\n\nI get why she\u2019s disappointed, but she\u2019ll get over it and grow from it. No harm, no foul if you ask me", "Honestly from how it sounds and feels, I\u2019m not surprised if your daughter went this route because she saw it from one of those rich show-offs on tiktok that goes to expensive as hell restaurants and she wanted to be trendy. Social media these days is really pushing it forward to make it seem like it\u2019s not a big deal and popularizes these places when most people can\u2019t afford it so easily", "I love this response. I'm incredibly passionate about food and have been since I was younger than OP's daughter. I wanted to go to a restaurant very like this when I was 17 and my parents somehow made it happen and I'll always be grateful they did. It was an amazing experience for me and that restaurant closed shortly after (I also do not live in an area where these types of restaurants are common). A new one has recently opened nearby for $200/head & while it's not feasible for us right now, I'm absolutely saving up to go ASAP. Not because I'm greedy or care about keeping up with the Jones' but because I love food, fine dining, and food experiences. It's like attending an art museum for me.", "This.... OP..... Talk to your child!", "Thank you, this is extremely insightful. I'm going to talk to my wife about it and plan what we want to discuss.", "Why would it be $3000 if they both wanted it? Wouldn\u2019t you then just have one celebratory dinner that was combined? \nNTA though this does warrant a much more deliberate conversation with your daughter in why this restaurant as well as general expectations and being reasonable.", "Yep!", "And this is a great time to learn that lesson!  Promises are not wishes granted by genies - she needs to learn this now while her parents can still teach it before she goes off into the world to be awful to her significant others and friends.", "It's not an ideal solution because as OP says it results in it not being an event for the whole family anymore, but it could be acceptable to everyone for a one time exception. \n\nIt's a perfectly reasonable suggestion. Sometimes redditors downvote mundane comments so unnecessarily.", "Incorrect. I made a factual statement. \u201cAny restaurant you want\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cany restaurant you want with exceptions.\u201d\n\nWith your logic, Olive Garden might\u2019ve been out of the budget. If you don\u2019t mean \u201cany restaurant,\u201d then don\u2019t say it.  \n\nSo explain how I\u2019m being obtuse.", "I did immediately following the request and she just said that she had learned about the restaurant and wanted to go and I said she could. I'll give her a couple of days and ask again.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking, she seemed pretty adamant on going to this highly expensive place, it does sound like she\u2019s trying to impress people/ someone.", "Thank you, this is very helpful. I think that's exactly it. I assumed that my kids had internalized a certain level of \"these things are reasonable to expect and these things are not\" that they haven't, because they have never grown up in need.\n\nAnd I'm glad they've never grown up in need. Growing up in need was super shitty, even though my parents were really great parents who were doing their best. But I grew up knowing that sometimes we had to make decisions that were like \"we can afford to buy new books or we can afford to buy milk, but not both.\" (Not because my parents were bad people. Because they were poor.) \n\nMy kids never grew up with that. Which is good in many ways. They never worried that we wouldn't have milk or bread next week. But they also never, I think, fully understood that finances meant tradeoffs. So this is where that is happening for them.\n\nAnyway, thank you again. This has been illuminating.", "I mean, if they both wanted a similarly expensive dinner at different times/in different places, it would cost that much. I wouldn't want to tell him that he has to have a cheaper dinner because his sister got to the expensive one first, that's all. Sorry, that was unclear.", "OP has taken the 5 seconds and set a reasonable limit. It just happened after the fact. If $1500 is not a big deal to you, I can send you my Venmo. \ud83d\ude0a", "I'm definitely a very big woman. :D", "You are picking a weird hill to die on. Yes, what OP said was too general, hence why the issue occurred, but no one should expect anyone to spend $1500 on them. The daughter was acting like a spoiled brat.", "Ok but apparently not since OP is in the situation.", "Agreed!", "NTA I think this could be a good learning experience for the whole family. How about having a family meeting to discuss. You could explain that your budget only permits spending up to $100 a person if the whole family goes, as has been done in the past, and all other restaurants within a one-hour drive fall into this category. \n\nHowever, your daughter has found a place that charges $300 a person, and you were previously unaware that there was such an expensive place. You could ask each family member to weigh in on the possibilities: picking a different restaurant where the entire family can enjoy a celebratory dinner together for your budgeted amount of $500 or having one parent take only her for a cost of $600, which is a bit over your budget but potentially doable.\n\nThen each person can discuss and hopefully come to a resolution. Your daughter could explain why this is so important to her and also consider how her siblings would feel if they didn\u2019t get to go out to dinner at all.", "My first guess was that a friend or someone at school was bragging about this amazing expensive restaurant and she wanted to go too", "Tradeoffs, exactly. Maybe a small \"If we do this, there goes our Christmas money\" discussion is in order. She's 15 and old enough to start being educated about budgeting and personal finance.", "Perhaps you could see if your son would want that restaurant too? If so you could just combine the celebrations. Tell them that that's the compromise for going to the really fancy restaurant \n\nI'd avoid telling your daughter that you're making that offer to your son though, unless he says yes, or she might try pressuring him", "But both kids are having both dinners regardless of which one chooses. Having only one dinner that's more expensive is a reasonable compromise, if that's amenable to your son. If he really doesn't care about going to this extremely expensive restaurant, perhaps instead of all 4 of you going, one parent and daughter can go to this one alone, and the other parent and son to his choice.", "That\u2019s like saying they put the condom on after the already busted a nut inside the vagina. Sorry, has to be done beforehand. I never said it wasn\u2019t a big deal. But I\u2019m not the one making grandiose promises.\n\nOP has every right to set a budget, still makes her the AH.", "\u201cBig man\u201d is a figure of speech.  It can apply to women too.", "I\u2019m allowed to disagree. Just because it\u2019s not the consensus doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s weird. OP made a promise that she couldn\u2019t keep. She\u2019s an AH for it. \nShe\u2019ll never make this promise in the future, without imposing some reasonable restrictions.", "I like this suggestion, instead of it being you break your promises, you are willing to fulfill your promise BUT there will be consequences (e.g., smaller Christmas presents for everybody) as a result.   \nThen it's her choice if she wants to revise her choice or not. If she doesn't though, you have to follow through else you are breaking a different kind of promise, that there are consequences for our choices.", "They haven\u2019t spent the $1500 on a meal yet. The nut hasn\u2019t been busted. And, despite what you might think, consent can be revoked at ANY time.", "Oh, I'm sorry. I genuinely hope you find people who love you the way you need and deserve.", "The nut was busted when they made the promise that she can eat at any restaurant. Yes, she can revoke that privilege, but it still makes her the AH.", "Back atcha\ud83d\ude10", "Thanks! I appreciate it.", "No problem! It\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re severely lacking in this area\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f"]}
