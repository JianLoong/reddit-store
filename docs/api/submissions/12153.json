I'm also the planner and the giver in not only my family (husband and kids) but my extended family (parents, siblings, friends, etc), so I'm the one that plans birthday get togethers, gifts, travel etc. I'm also a SAHM due to having a son with complex medical and behavioral needs. I've been with him 24/7 for the last week as it's school break and he's extremely clingy and has behavioral problems due to mental illnesses. I also had a upper respiratory cold during this time, sore throat, fever, cough, runny nose, ear ache. But kept up with mom duties none the less.\n\nMy husband's birthday was last month and as usual I planned something for him. Weekend in a town a couple hours away for us and our kids. \n\nFor my birthday I tell him I just want help with the kids, the house cleaned, a nap, and him to cook supper or take me out. Maybe a homemade gift from the kids and a cake. \n\nYesterday, my husband starts complaining of a sore throat. I check his throat and looks fine. No fever or other symptoms.  He stays up all night playing video games. \n\nThis morning he says he is sick, but has no visible symptoms.  No fever, no cough, no runny nose, doesn't sound like someone with a cold. He says his throat hurts but spent an hour on XBox live talking just fine. \n\nHe naps all day because he says he's sick, I think it's because he stayed up until 4 a.m. playing video games. Meanwhile I make my own cake, take care of the kids as usual, and do my usual chores. He didn't even tell me happy birthday.  \n\nFinally I decided to take the cake I made with the kids to my parents house to have supper there so I didn't have to cook. I'm pretty crabby at this point and don't say a word before we leave. He calls and asks why we left. I tell him because he ruined my birthday yet again and I'm trying to salvage it at least a little and hung up. He called back and said I was overreacting. He's sick and I'm an adult, birthdays aren't a big deal anymore after 21. \n\nSo AITA for wanting 1 day to be the receiver instead of the giver? To celebrate myself?", "created_utc": 1678660960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11psbi3/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_ruined_my_birthday/", "score": 342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, it seems like he isn't helping with the children appropriately, either. he says he is sick, but he actually stayed up to play video games. if he actually is sick, that was dumb. Whether or not he was sick, it was self-centered. I think that issue should get resolved.\n\nAnd Happy Birthday!", "NTA\nYour husband seems selfish af.  Instead of doing something as easy and simple as buying a cake,and arranging takeout for dinner (bare minimum) he decided to pretend he\u2019s sick all day and play video games.

He did this deliberately and it is time to decide what this relates means to him.", "Happy Birthday OP - it\u2019s my bday today too, sending you a little bit of glitter and sparkle and universal birthday love\n\nNTA obviously x", "NTA, very  NTA", "Nta.

There may be some people who say, \u201cyou don\u2019t know how sick he felt on the inside\u201d. I agree, he could have been miserable and needed to sleep, OP isn\u2019t a doctor\u2026 but none of that matters! I\u2019m a guy, it would take an insane amount of pain for me to not put together something for my partner. Especially if I knew it was important to her. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re exhausted and you stay up Christmas Eve to put together the presents so Santa can give your kids a magical day.\n\nYou find the strength from within.

A birthday can be postponed. So if it can be postponed, postpone it. \n\nIt's just a freaking date on a calendar! \n\n>But kept up with mom duties none the less.\n\nCome on! When you're sick, you prioritize what the necessary stuff, you prioritize the recovery, you cut out/postpone the unnecessary stuff, and you ask for help from others. \n\nThere is no prize for being a martyr. Is this the lesson you want to teach your kids? That when they're sick, they should continue working? That they should continue to go to school and to birthday parties?", "She seems kinda unlikable.", "This is the best advice.

There's nothing wrong with an adult staying up late sometimes if he helps with chores when he wakes up, doesn't late it interfere with work etc. But most importantly you should be able to reciprocate. If your partner stayes out with friends late sometimes, you should be the one to cover for them and get the children ready in the morning etc.\n\nWhat really sucks here is that he stayed up late the day of her bday.

He has ADHD and it's a pretty regular occurrence with special days.", "We're going through application process for ssdi", "I'm going to sound so shallow for this, but the biggest thing is I'm financially stuck. I currently do not have my own income. Had to quit my career to be a SAHM for youngest kiddos needs.

Thank you.", "Maybe, but if he's getting sick, staying up until 4am playing video games isn't a great way to try to kick it.", "She asked for a lot? Are you kidding me? What she asked for are things he should be helping with anyway. The children, food, cleaning and allowing her to have a nap. His responsibilities are out of whack and he's not behaving like a grown adult. He has a wife and children now and it's not just about him. He needs to grow up.", "She asked him to do things he should already be doing. Nothing of what she asked of him was too much.", "No. Just No. NTA", "Oops guess the husband found OP\u2019s post.", "If he's sick why was he up until 4 am playing video games? Yeah, he's \"sick\".", "Ew.", "Honestly he\u2019s also an adult. If you feel like you\u2019re getting sick (even if it\u2019s not visible) you take some NyQuil, get your ass to bed as a reasonable time and get some sleep and take a stupid amount of vitamin C the next morning. He KNEW he had ONE DAY out of 365 to not fuck things up for the sake of his partner and he let his own selfish wants. He can let himself be sick tomorrow, but today should have been for OP.", "What a coincidence, all women who advocate for themselves seem to be mysteriously unlikeable.", " How do you arrive at this opinion? I'm genuinely curious.", "How so?", "How so? \n\nTo me, she seems like she just wanted to have something simple like her husband to help out more and give a small fraction of what she typically does for his birthday.", "Right.
