I'm also the planner and the giver in not only my family (husband and kids) but my extended family (parents, siblings, friends, etc), so I'm the one that plans birthday get togethers, gifts, travel etc. I'm also a SAHM due to having a son with complex medical and behavioral needs. I've been with him 24/7 for the last week as it's school break and he's extremely clingy and has behavioral problems due to mental illnesses. I also had a upper respiratory cold during this time, sore throat, fever, cough, runny nose, ear ache. But kept up with mom duties none the less.\n\nMy husband's birthday was last month and as usual I planned something for him. Weekend in a town a couple hours away for us and our kids. \n\nFor my birthday I tell him I just want help with the kids, the house cleaned, a nap, and him to cook supper or take me out. Maybe a homemade gift from the kids and a cake. \n\nYesterday, my husband starts complaining of a sore throat. I check his throat and looks fine. No fever or other symptoms.  He stays up all night playing video games. \n\nThis morning he says he is sick, but has no visible symptoms.  No fever, no cough, no runny nose, doesn't sound like someone with a cold. He says his throat hurts but spent an hour on XBox live talking just fine. \n\nHe naps all day because he says he's sick, I think it's because he stayed up until 4 a.m. playing video games. Meanwhile I make my own cake, take care of the kids as usual, and do my usual chores. He didn't even tell me happy birthday.  \n\nFinally I decided to take the cake I made with the kids to my parents house to have supper there so I didn't have to cook. I'm pretty crabby at this point and don't say a word before we leave. He calls and asks why we left. I tell him because he ruined my birthday yet again and I'm trying to salvage it at least a little and hung up. He called back and said I was overreacting. He's sick and I'm an adult, birthdays aren't a big deal anymore after 21. \n\nSo AITA for wanting 1 day to be the receiver instead of the giver? To celebrate myself?", "created_utc": 1678660960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11psbi3/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_ruined_my_birthday/", "score": 5151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then you leave, and he has the nerve to call you up and ask why you left. What? Why would he bother? Well, so that when you expressed anger and disappointment by his inattention on your birthday, he could again go on the offensive by diminishing your feelings and saying you are too old to celebrate birthdays.\n\nYou know who tries to plant the message they are too sick to do anything the next day,  by talking about a sore throat? A child hoping to make a case for staying home from school. At least the child has to make a case for not going to school the next day when it is clear they aren't really that sick.\n\nEven if he had a sore throat, it's ludicrous to be so self-centered. Like another poster said, he could have told you at the time when he was getting sick how it might mean he was not feeling up to cleaning, taking care of the kids and getting a cake, it would depend on how he was feeling. But to ignore it, and then act offended because you left, that's just dishonesty.\n\nIt's also possible that he doesn't really care about or appreciate birthday celebrations the way you do, so you go all out on his birthday because it's important to you, and he doesn't reciprocate because he doesn't think it's important. So next year, don't bother. You may be modeling how you would like to be treated by giving him a birthday celebration, but the message is not getting across, so just stop.\n\nAlso, he honestly should take a COVID-19 test at this point.

Lay out (and if you can document especially if you see things getting messy) what you expect from him as a husband, father and partner. If he cannot and will not step up, that's his loss. You can find someone who will or you can not deal with it and do it for yourself. Things like this are just beyond unacceptable. The last few years have been the worst in my marriage, our relationship got toxic as Fukushima. And my husband still got me a small gift I loved, a piece of cake and told me happy birthday, even though he was also telling me I was the absolute worst thing to ever happen to him and he never wanted to see me again. \n\nIf there's something there and you want to try to work it out, do it. Relationships can turn horrible for a variety of reasons. They can be healed if both partners are willing to put the time and work into doing so. I know because that's what happened with my husband and I. I didn't think it would ever happen. If you're the only one trying though, stop. Relationships are not 50/50, they are 100/100.
