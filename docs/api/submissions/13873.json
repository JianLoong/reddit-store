Your daughter hasn't learned that cleaning up after pets is part of pet ownership because she has been \"better than\" her brothers for two years. That's not preparing her for owning a pet in the future.", "> the worst behaved in a given week would be responsible for all the pet clean-up duty for the following week.\n\nWell this is a bullshit way to decide pet care.

Looking after your pet is not a punishment is a daily DUTY. It\u2019s like doing your home work, clean up after yourself and whatever other chores you have on for your kids. I think you should change that rule and do a rotation schedule. That said she better mask up and clean up as her sibling did for 3 YEARS. And cheating is quite sever on my book even if after you flap your eyelashes and say pretty sorry.", "NTA for sticking to the rules but it\u2019s a ridiculous rule to begin with tbh. How exactly do you determine who has been the worst behaved? There are so many factors, not to mention the whole behavior being communication thing.

Why do you think that is?\n\nDear Lord, she already paid for her decision with a 0 and the shame of being caught cheating.

Why not just put it on rotation so that it feels fair for all of them?\n\nIt's also worth noting that, if she's actually at the point of gagging while doing this, she might not be the best fit for the job.

Take your cats to the vet before you all catch something nasty like intestinal parasites or coccidia. YTA", "I agree with you. It shouldn\u2019t be a punishment but merely a household choir someone has to do this time, like vacuming, doing the dishes, et cetera. My sister and I had to walk the dog we had as a child.

Too bad, we have a dog and he needs to pee.", "Surprised to see many NTA responses - I wonder if they\u2019ve ever had pets. This is as correct as possible here, the metric is stupid and considering the kids do other chores, I wonder how much the parents do in the house that isn\u2019t just \u201craising kids, pay for bills\u201d. Adding on to this, pets shouldn\u2019t be used as a way to set punishments. And this can be applied to chores too.

It's intensely water-resistant and they rub it into everything on their enclosure. They also spray from their anal glands when they poo to add some muskiness to the already heinous stench.\n\nI had a friend ask me a **week** later if I'd gotten ferrets recently...\n\nYeah, my hoofstock-keeper nose was **not** ready for that \ud83e\udd22. The otter keepers got a bit of a laugh as they got to spend the morning catching up on paperwork and training as I suffered, though.", "Also ferrets.

This might be an unpopular opinion, but maybe it's time to explore another option on managing pets. You want to teach them responsibility, but using cleaning up as a punishment for misbehavior is going to have your kids associate cleaning up with punishment, which for me, gave me extra negative feelings as a kid on already a tedious/boring/etc chore (mine was sweeping up the floor - yes, I'm a stupid kid that preferred to read than do chores). Cleaning up after yourselves (and your responsibilites) should be a basic requirement of life.", "YTA, this is stupid on two counts. Parents that get large pets like cats and dogs with the expectation that their kids will be solely responsible for their care are idiots. Some kids do well with that responsibility, but you don't get pets on your kid's guarantee that they will take care of the pets. Second rather than spreading out the responsibility you treat it as a punishment, what happens when all the kids don't act out? Are you going to get them for petty reasons, are they going to have to walk on eggshells around you, will they try and get their siblings in trouble so they don't have to do it?", "YTA for the punishment of being badly behaved equaling pet care.

That should have never happened.", "You got the pets, you are the adult, looking after them should be your responsibility. If you don't wanna clean up after them then you never should've got them.

That\u2019s the promise you make them take when you agree to get them the pets. \n\nYour daughter sucks for being fine with her siblings having to do it for three years, but trying to get out of it when it was her turn. \n\nYou and your wife get additional suck points for not realizing that sick cat having diarrhea all over the floor is a special circumstance that both of you as parents should have helped her with. \n\nJust all around awful parenting on your part.", "YTA. Children will agree to anything if it gets them what they want. The amount of times I\u2019ve heard a parent say that their child is going to be the responsible one and take care of all the animals is way too many. I\u2019ve told people straight up that their kids are going to flake and they\u2019ll need to pick up the slack. If that\u2019s not something they\u2019re willing or able to do, don\u2019t get the pet.\n\nAlso, take your damn cats to the vet. They may have giardia or something. Diarrhea and going outside the box can be signs of serious issues.", "Not an AH for sticking to the rules you set, but honestly, this rule is awful. I don't see how your sons haven't raised a bigger stink about this before now. \n\nIt does nothing to teach your daughter about responsibility, by never having pet chores, and I'm sure it doesn't help correct your sons' behaviour if the responsibility is always on them. \n\nSo... YTA.", "NTA this week - if you cancel it this week, it's abundantly clear you're playing favourites. It's unfortunate timing but that's life and is a good lesson to all the kids, sometimes punishments don't fit the crime. If Alyssa gets off the whole system is biased. She'll know she can manipulate you. The others will feel less loved (surely there's been another sick pet in 3 years of 8 pets?!). What's to stop her misbehaving going forward if she gets forgiven and others don't?\n\nHowever, I agree with others that it's an unhealthy \"agreement\". I find it hard to believe the \"troublemakers\" voted for this, turkeys don't vote for Christmas, so I'm assuming this was agreement under duress. \n\nAlso extremely unfair and unhealthy because there is no fair and unbiased way to judge who is worst behaved, and undoubtedly your boys already feel like you love the girls a little more than them.", "In corporate this is known as stack ranking.
