However the way you decide is pretty messed up. Make it fair and put it on a rotation like a normal person.", "INFO: Why don't they just take care of the pets that they asked for instead of making one of them care for pets they didn't want?", "YTA  The way you are organising this is terrible.", "YTA.\n\nCleaning up after pets shouldn't be a punishment.", "NTA - I see a lot of comments talking about how the punishment set up is wrong but that is what your family talked about and came to a decision on so I don't see a problem with it.\n\nAs for your daughter, this is called parenting. She agreed to the conditions and was fine with it until it didn't benefit her. Be proud that you didn't give in to her and stuck with your convictions.", "YTA, but not for what happened now, but for what happened 3 years ago. What kind of stupid rule ist that... Of course children should feel obligated to look after the pets, but in the end every parent knows, that is is eventually up to them to supervise that - or rather do it themselves...\n\nAnd than using this \"duties\" as punishment... What happens if all behave good in a given week? Will you do it yourself or are you just deciding somehow who was worst behaved...\n\nI mean if your children hate you pets, I couldn't blame them.", "NTA for enforcing her punishment - this was the agreement. She has never had to do it before so shouldn't get out of it this time.   \n\n\nPunishing the 'worst behaved' child that week with it though...not sure about that. That's like rating your kids as better or worse than...and caring for pets is a responsibility of pet ownership that should be shared equally...not used as a punishment. Your daughter hasn't learned that cleaning up after pets is part of pet ownership because she has been \"better than\" her brothers for two years. That's not preparing her for owning a pet in the future.", "> the worst behaved in a given week would be responsible for all the pet clean-up duty for the following week.\n\nWell this is a bullshit way to decide pet care. All the chores should be even, including the animals. \n\nThe kids should be involved in the animal care but it shouldn't be the punishment for being naughty. \n\nWho do the animals belong to? and what part of the animal care do you do? \n\nYTA for the whole set up. NTA for enforcing it with your daughter who gets to clean up after animals for the first time.", "NTA for making kids follow rules, but WTF? Instead of sharing responsibility for pets that should be treasured, and teaching responsibility for doing the work to have something you want -- taking care of pets became a punishment that you could delve out? And one kid NEVER had to take care of them, but just got the good part of enjoying them?\n\nThat is the WORST set of rules regarding pets I've ever heard of.", "YTA not for making her up cleaning but for the mistake you made 3 years ago. Looking after your pet is not a punishment is a daily DUTY. It\u2019s like doing your home work, clean up after yourself and whatever other chores you have on for your kids. I think you should change that rule and do a rotation schedule. That said she better mask up and clean up as her sibling did for 3 YEARS. And cheating is quite sever on my book even if after you flap your eyelashes and say pretty sorry.", "NTA for sticking to the rules but it\u2019s a ridiculous rule to begin with tbh. How exactly do you determine who has been the worst behaved? There are so many factors, not to mention the whole behavior being communication thing. Just seems weird when you could have had a rotating schedule where one kid takes care of the cats, one the dogs, one the ferrets, and one the snake and it switches each week.", "YTA. \"Worst-behaved\" is an awful metric to choose who looks after pets. Especially with 8 of them, Christ! Do you ever get \"worst-behaved,\" or is this just something you force on your kids? I can't imagine what happens on weeks when all of the kids are well-behaved and you still need somebody to pin pet duty on.\n\nYeah, yeah. \"They agreed to it.\" I agree to pay taxes. Why do you think that is?\n\nDear Lord, she already paid for her decision with a 0 and the shame of being caught cheating. Try to address the root cause of that before hawking off chores that should be shard in the first place. She clearly doesn't need fewer hours to spends preparing for her tests.", "Nta.  This is called being a parent", "NTA on enforcing rules, but I do see a bit of an AH situation here personally and would go with YTA for the wider situation.\n\nI'm really not a fan of how you chose to set these rules up as pitting your children against each other really isn't the healthiest choice. Why not just put it on rotation so that it feels fair for all of them?\n\nIt's also worth noting that, if she's actually at the point of gagging while doing this, she might not be the best fit for the job. I **physically gag and throw up** when cleaning up dog poo, it's just the way I respond to it. My husband recognises that and, rather than you know, torturing me with a task that makes me physically ill, he takes care of it and I do other things.", "This made me smile because it's similar to a policy at the zoo I used to work at, as a zookeeper in the 1990s.\n\nIf you were late to your shift, you'd be given a gross chore you weren't accustomed to.\n\n(Going through the zoo restaurant's dumpster and sorting out recyclables from trash, cleaning out the months worth of congealed filth from the drains in the penguin habitat...)\n\nI was late **once** and thought I'd gotten off \"easy\" by only being made to clean the otter dens. Spoiler: It wasn't easy \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22", "NTA.  She\u2019s trying to get out of cleaning by being daddy\u2019s little girl.  The whole reason for the punishment is so she\u2019ll behave.  I doubt she\u2019ll cheat on another test.  Tell her to suck it up.", "> in fact her chores might be the least time-consuming of us all this week.\n\nINFO: Why is it so hated if it's the easiest / shortest set of chores to do? \n\nI've never had pets so maybe I don't get it, but seems like the shorter, the better.", "YTA\n\nEach one should clean up behind their own pets.\n\nUsing care of pets as a punishments sets these kids up as seeing pet care as a punishments as they get older.", "NTA - this is good parenting. You are enforcing rules that have been established for years. Taking her off it now would make the other children feel you are showing favour. Cleaning up after the pets for a week is barely even a punishment.", "N-T-A until you mentioned that the cats have a \u201cstomach bug\u201d. You\u2019re putting your child\u2019s health at risk by having (any of!) them clean up after a sick animal. Take your cats to the vet before you all catch something nasty like intestinal parasites or coccidia. YTA", "I agree with you. It shouldn\u2019t be a punishment but merely a household choir someone has to do this time, like vacuming, doing the dishes, et cetera. My sister and I had to walk the dog we had as a child. Not everytime of course (my parents did as well) but we had to do it. It rains? Too bad, we have a dog and he needs to pee.", "Surprised to see many NTA responses - I wonder if they\u2019ve ever had pets. This is as correct as possible here, the metric is stupid and considering the kids do other chores, I wonder how much the parents do in the house that isn\u2019t just \u201craising kids, pay for bills\u201d. Adding on to this, pets shouldn\u2019t be used as a way to set punishments. And this can be applied to chores too. Linking chores with punishments gives a bad experience with them, which isn\u2019t good for setting up the kids for their future. \nI don\u2019t get how they aren\u2019t just taking care of a pet(s) each every day, with guidance and help from the parents. They\u2019re not responsible for having pets yet they have a lot of them AND children, geez this is worrying.", "What was so bad about the otters?", "I've had a bunch of pets over the years. You love them and want the best for them, so of course you clean up after them, but.. Well, no one is really *eager* to clean up poop, y'know?", "Wondering what happens to the pets if everybody behave like angels for few weeks. Looking after pets is a duty not a punishment. You don\u2019t want to look after the pets, don\u2019t get them.", "Everything!!\n\nUgh, the poo is like pure essence of rotten fish mixed with hog manure, and laced with a bit of ammonia that drills into your nose. They smear it everywhere and it has the consistency of jelly. Fish jelly.\n\nThey're also mustelids like ferrets that produce ungodly amounts of musk (think unneutered male ferret but 50x the quantity and much more potent). It's intensely water-resistant and they rub it into everything on their enclosure. They also spray from their anal glands when they poo to add some muskiness to the already heinous stench.\n\nI had a friend ask me a **week** later if I'd gotten ferrets recently...\n\nYeah, my hoofstock-keeper nose was **not** ready for that \ud83e\udd22. The otter keepers got a bit of a laugh as they got to spend the morning catching up on paperwork and training as I suffered, though.", "Also ferrets. Growing up we've had cats, dogs, hamsters, rabbits, a turtle, fish, axolotls, a mouse and ferrets. Ferrets smell absolutely foul"]}
