That's not preparing her for owning a pet in the future.", "> the worst behaved in a given week would be responsible for all the pet clean-up duty for the following week.\n\nWell this is a bullshit way to decide pet care.

Why do you think that is?\n\nDear Lord, she already paid for her decision with a 0 and the shame of being caught cheating.

Why not just put it on rotation so that it feels fair for all of them?\n\nIt's also worth noting that, if she's actually at the point of gagging while doing this, she might not be the best fit for the job.

Take your cats to the vet before you all catch something nasty like intestinal parasites or coccidia. YTA", "I agree with you. It shouldn\u2019t be a punishment but merely a household choir someone has to do this time, like vacuming, doing the dishes, et cetera. My sister and I had to walk the dog we had as a child.

Too bad, we have a dog and he needs to pee.", "Surprised to see many NTA responses - I wonder if they\u2019ve ever had pets. This is as correct as possible here, the metric is stupid and considering the kids do other chores, I wonder how much the parents do in the house that isn\u2019t just \u201craising kids, pay for bills\u201d. Adding on to this, pets shouldn\u2019t be used as a way to set punishments. And this can be applied to chores too.

It's intensely water-resistant and they rub it into everything on their enclosure.

This might be an unpopular opinion, but maybe it's time to explore another option on managing pets. You want to teach them responsibility, but using cleaning up as a punishment for misbehavior is going to have your kids associate cleaning up with punishment, which for me, gave me extra negative feelings as a kid on already a tedious/boring/etc chore (mine was sweeping up the floor - yes, I'm a stupid kid that preferred to read than do chores). Cleaning up after yourselves (and your responsibilites) should be a basic requirement of life.", "YTA, this is stupid on two counts. Parents that get large pets like cats and dogs with the expectation that their kids will be solely responsible for their care are idiots. Some kids do well with that responsibility, but you don't get pets on your kid's guarantee that they will take care of the pets. Second rather than spreading out the responsibility you treat it as a punishment, what happens when all the kids don't act out?

That\u2019s the promise you make them take when you agree to get them the pets. \n\nYour daughter sucks for being fine with her siblings having to do it for three years, but trying to get out of it when it was her turn. \n\nYou and your wife get additional suck points for not realizing that sick cat having diarrhea all over the floor is a special circumstance that both of you as parents should have helped her with. \n\nJust all around awful parenting on your part.", "YTA. Children will agree to anything if it gets them what they want. The amount of times I\u2019ve heard a parent say that their child is going to be the responsible one and take care of all the animals is way too many. I\u2019ve told people straight up that their kids are going to flake and they\u2019ll need to pick up the slack. If that\u2019s not something they\u2019re willing or able to do, don\u2019t get the pet.\n\nAlso, take your damn cats to the vet. They may have giardia or something. Diarrhea and going outside the box can be signs of serious issues.", "Not an AH for sticking to the rules you set, but honestly, this rule is awful. I don't see how your sons haven't raised a bigger stink about this before now. \n\nIt does nothing to teach your daughter about responsibility, by never having pet chores, and I'm sure it doesn't help correct your sons' behaviour if the responsibility is always on them. \n\nSo... YTA.", "NTA this week - if you cancel it this week, it's abundantly clear you're playing favourites. It's unfortunate timing but that's life and is a good lesson to all the kids, sometimes punishments don't fit the crime. If Alyssa gets off the whole system is biased. She'll know she can manipulate you. The others will feel less loved (surely there's been another sick pet in 3 years of 8 pets?!). What's to stop her misbehaving going forward if she gets forgiven and others don't?\n\nHowever, I agree with others that it's an unhealthy \"agreement\". I find it hard to believe the \"troublemakers\" voted for this, turkeys don't vote for Christmas, so I'm assuming this was agreement under duress. \n\nAlso extremely unfair and unhealthy because there is no fair and unbiased way to judge who is worst behaved, and undoubtedly your boys already feel like you love the girls a little more than them.", "In corporate this is known as stack ranking.

They are still like this as adults and none of them get along.\n\nAlso, making the responsibility of pets a punishment means they will learn to hate taking care of their pets which are living creatures who deserve to be taken care of well. The \u201cgood\u201d children aren\u2019t actually learning to appreciate a healthy routine, and the \u201cbad\u201d kids will resent being told they\u2019re \u201cbad\u201d so often they\u2019ll stop trying to be good.\n\nOP YTA - get a better system.", "It\u2019s unfairly fair or fairly unfair? I have mixed opinions about this one. On one hand, you as the parents shouldn\u2019t own so many pets if it\u2019s a \u201cchore\u201d to take care of. Having animals should be about teaching responsibility and compassion. This is going to have the opposite affect. On the other hand, this is the 1x Alyssa has had to the \u201cchore\u201d of maintaining the animals for a week in the entire 3yrs of having the pets. The other siblings did it for their punishment. She should abide by the agreement. I suggest changing up the rules, each kid/2 kids clean up after the pets each week. Or each kid takes up the responsibility of their own pets. The whole \u201cweekly judgment\u201d thing is kind of weird. Have a discussion with the family and bounce ideas around to see what works for all of you.", "She can wear a swimmer\u2019s nose plug if the smell is that awful.\n\nIt\u2019s what I wear when I clean my cat\u2019s litter box and I\u2019m autistic and particularly sensitive to smells.", "YTA\n\nThe way your agreement is set up it has created a competition between your children. It had good intentions and not a \"your children will be ruined\" sanario. More of a you are going to make yourself and your kids life a bit tougher on the relationship angle with this kind of foundation. Also, crime does not fit the punishment due to bad luck on cats being sick.\n\nMaybe keep this in mind for the future. I understand there was no ill will here and I imagine dealing with the animals is stressful.", "YTA having a pet teaches children responsability, compassion and what giving unconditional love is like since they are only used to recieving it.

A thing to be avoided. How on *earth* did you not see that ingraining your children with the idea that looking after other living beings is to be avoided at all costs is a really bad idea?? You're teaching them to value grades and arbitrary approval over a living thing's care and feeding.\n\n\nI just ...
