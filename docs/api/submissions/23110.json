I received an invitation to the wedding in my name only. My spouse gets the mail from the mailbox because they're home during the day (and they pay the bills), so keeping the \"me-only\" invitation under wraps not an option. Plus I wouldn't feel comfortable hiding something even if I could.\n\nAt first we thought maybe it was a mistake. I reached out to my sister, the groom's mother, and she verified that there had been no mistake - my spouse was not welcome at the wedding.\n\nI've been with my spouse for almost 20 years. We've had our ups and downs like any couple, but we've managed to stay together. I'm very close to my family, and as the youngest child, I probably look to them for approval a bit more than I should. I may also have overshared with them some details of past disagreements with my spouse, that we've since overcome, but it seems my family won't let me forget.\n\nMy spouse has had a rough relationship with my family. No direct conflict, but lots of passive-aggressive behaviors, from both sides honestly. They differ politically, which is part of the problem. They've also seen us bicker at holiday parties, for which we were both equally responsible. That hasn't happened in years, but my family acts like its a reason not to invite my spouse. Honestly I think my spouse would be totally respectful at the wedding, but my sister and family disagree.\n\nI really don't want to go to the wedding without my spouse, because there is a sense of betrayal on my part if I do. I know my spouse will feel hurt if I go. Why would I want to go somewhere and pretend to enjoy myself knowing my spouse was at home being specifically excluded?\n\nI'm so torn though because the wedding is going to be BEAUTIFUL and I hate not seeing my other family members. And I know if I don't go, my family will say my spouse \"controlled\" me and kept me from the wedding, when the opposite is actually true! My spouse admitted it would cause some pain if I went, and did seem rather upset when I didn't immediately decline the invite, but ultimately said I was free to go. I'm not saying they were happy about it, buy they allowed me the freedom. Possibly the freedom to make a huge mistake?\n\nWhat say you?

You said you overshared past problems between you and your spouse, that both sides have been passive aggressive, and that you and your spouse have had problems at family events. Given all this, yes, your family is going to hold a grudge against spouse on your behalf. Yes, the family vs spouse attitudes are also a factor, as are the both of you fighting in public.

You admit they've been emotionally abusive towards you, and they have a history of acting poorly at family gatherings.  No, no one wants to run the risk of having the couple who always fights at parties get in a fight at the wedding.  In addition, while you don't mention what his political beliefs are, the fact that prayer is what you credit with their behavioral change is a pretty strong suggestion of what those might be.  So I suspect they may be vocal about beliefs that are either disrespectful to other guests or would make other guests uncomfortable.  On the whole, they've got a STRONG case for their exclusion.\n\nThey could have excluded you too, after all you admit you're just as bad as they are, but you're family so they didn't.  \n\nBut this is what marriage is.  If you decide you're going to spend 20 years backing this kind of person, then you're going to be unable to go to events where they aren't welcome.  If you don't like what that means, then you need to reconsider the person you're staying married to.  If you choose the wedding, I think it's likely you will end this marriage.  Which honestly doesn't sound like the worst thing in the world given how you describe it, but that's what it is.  \n\nIf you want to stay married, then you should support your spouse.  If the wedding is more important than supporting your spouse of 20 years, then don't drag it out.  After 20 years, it should be a no brainer to choose your spouse.  I think it isn't for good reason, and you should consider that.  But if after 20 years you can't easily choose them over a wedding, then it's time to call it.", "YWBTA\nThey are doing it to exclude and slight your husband.  It's time to pick which side you are on.

You shouldn't air your marital problems to the degree that puts your partner in an impossible situation. I realize that we all need emotional support sometimes but perhaps turning to friends would have been more prudent. Your family clearly doesn't like your partner and now you can't change that.

We've had our ups and downs like any couple, but we've managed to stay together. I'm very close to my family, and as the youngest child, I probably look to them for approval a bit more than I should. I may also have overshared with them some details of past disagreements with my spouse, that we've since overcome, but it seems my family won't let me forget.\n\nMy spouse has had a rough relationship with my family. No direct conflict, but lots of passive-aggressive behaviors, from both sides honestly. They differ politically, which is part of the problem. They've also seen us bicker at holiday parties, for which we were both equally responsible. That hasn't happened in years, but my family acts like its a reason not to invite my spouse. Honestly I think my spouse would be totally respectful at the wedding, but my sister and family disagree.\n\nI really don't want to go to the wedding without my spouse, because there is a sense of betrayal on my part if I do. I know my spouse will feel hurt if I go. Why would I want to go somewhere and pretend to enjoy myself knowing my spouse was at home being specifically excluded?\n\n I'm so torn though because the wedding is going to be BEAUTIFUL and I hate not seeing my other family members. And I know if I don't go, my family will say my spouse \"controlled\" me and kept me from the wedding, when the opposite is actually true!

You've left out a lot of information about the dynamic between your spouse and your family but I suspect he has burned some bridges.

That doesn't help if your partner and you are known to have squabbles at family events or your partner gets into small quips about political topics when he knows that should be a \"no-go\" during family functions.  If you know you disagree, it's better to keep it to Facebook and not at a family event. Holidays and family events should not have those things as a basis of conversation because it draws up more conflict than people would care to deal with when they are just wanting to spend time with family.  \n\nUltimately, it's the groom and bride who decides who to invite. And they've welcomed you.  \n\nYour partner has given the go-ahead, even if reluctantly, and I think that's something you need to discuss. \n\nUse this to discuss the good qualities of your partner while attending. Adding their praises that they were patient and wanted you to come to the event and wished the bride and groom the best (have him get a gift or card for them, make sure it's off their registry and a note sans passive-aggressiveness). This will make them re-evaluate him as a person and reconsider his attending future events. \n\nIt may hurt,  but there was a clear reason they left him out, so now you need to refocus on getting him to be reinvited to future functions. That means no passive-aggressive nonsense, keeping squabbles at home, and being supportive of one another even if your family isn't inviting him.  \n\nThe focus right now is to regain your family's confidence in him.  You can't do that fighting them to get him to come.  So don't. Your looking at the long term here. \n\nFor now, I'm going with N.A.H. since there isn't enough info.\n\nEdit: I saw you had an affair with a co-worker. If you're that good at hiding an affair,  it also makes me question exactly what you're telling your family about your spouse and it also explains why you were not as forthcoming in your post. You need to work on yourself the most here.  My advice still stands, but you owe your partner far more credit and forgiveness than you've given. That includes being Faithful, and not just in a religious sense. \n\nIf you're telling all your family the bad things about your partner, it's likely safe to assume you haven't told them about your affair. You wouldn't want to look bad, would you? It's very unfair to your partner that you've painted them in such a bad light when you are equally to blame for the relationship not doing well at certain points, especially after cheating. \n\nSo here's what you should do. Tell your family. You are no Saint and you shouldn't be painting this horrid picture of your partner while also covering up your disgusting behavior. It takes two to make a relationship work,  and you've not done your fair share by walking out like that. Cheating is never acceptable. Period. Even if your partner was emotionally abusive, you have every ability to leave said person if your not happy. But carrying on like nothing happened and cheating is not okay. \n\nQuite frankly, if I knew you'd cheated on your partner,  I'd revoke the invite to the wedding because you clearly don't respect monogamy or the ideals it holds.", "I feel like we\u2019re getting very little of the real story and you\u2019re glossing over what\u2019s really going on.

We have two kids and have been married 12 years. About 4 years ago I had an emotional affair with a much younger person at work. I fantasized about leaving my spouse for this much younger person. I couldn't get this person off my mind, even though my spouse had done nothing wrong. I knew deep down it was ridiculous to think this much younger person would marry me, but I dreamt none the less. We talked a lot and wound up going to lunch together a few times. We did do some heavy petting and kissing in the car, and there was full hand contact to completion both ways, but no intercourse. This happened a few times. I felt a great connection. But eventually my much younger paramour seemed to lose interest in going to lunch with me, and shortly thereafter quit. I texted a few times but got terse replies, if any. It took me a good year, but I finally cleared this person from my mind and never saw them again. Now I honestly feel like its the dumbest thing I've ever done in my life, risking my marriage like that. During counseling, I admitted this affair to my spouse as an \"emotional affair\" only. I admitted my fascination and going to lunch, but never admitted to the 3rd base action. When pressed in counseling by our counselor, I later admitted \"we may have kissed a little\" and now I feel terrible because I've had to lie about what else took place. My spouse keeps bringing it up and pressing me more like they know, but I just honestly don't feel the additional information does anything to help our relationship heal, and would only confuse matters and provide ammo if there is a divorce.

We have two kids and have been married 12 years. About 4 years ago I had an emotional affair with a much younger person at work. I fantasized about leaving my spouse for this much younger person. I couldn't get this person off my mind, even though my spouse had done nothing wrong. I knew deep down it was ridiculous to think this much younger person would marry me, but I dreamt none the less. We talked a lot and wound up going to lunch together a few times. We did do some heavy petting and kissing in the car, and there was full hand contact to completion both ways, but no intercourse. This happened a few times. I felt a great connection. But eventually my much younger paramour seemed to lose interest in going to lunch with me, and shortly thereafter quit. I texted a few times but got terse replies, if any. It took me a good year, but I finally cleared this person from my mind and never saw them again. Now I honestly feel like its the dumbest thing I've ever done in my life, risking my marriage like that. During counseling, I admitted this affair to my spouse as an \"emotional affair\" only. I admitted my fascination and going to lunch, but never admitted to the 3rd base action. When pressed in counseling by our counselor, I later admitted \"we may have kissed a little\" and now I feel terrible because I've had to lie about what else took place. My spouse keeps bringing it up and pressing me more like they know, but I just honestly don't feel the additional information does anything to help our relationship heal, and would only confuse matters and provide ammo if there is a divorce. The other side of me says counseling will never work if I can't trust my spouse enough to be fully honest with them.
