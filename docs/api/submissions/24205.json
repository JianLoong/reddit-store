At one (I can\u2019t remember which), a lady was begging for a couple bucks just to get a sandwich because she was hungry and had no money. \n\nI literally had no cash but, I did have a small unopened bag of Doritos. It was not a sandwich of course but, I\u2019m thinking if you starving sustenance is sustenance. \n\nDo you know when I offered her MY small bag of unopened Doritos she friggen sneered at me? Sneered! At the time I was thinking like damn I was just trying to help however meagerly. \n\nTook me years before I realized she just wanted money to buy drugs. Oh well. These days I will not give a bum money but, I\u2019ll get them a sandwich or some water on a hot day.", "Damn right about that. It took me a while to learn this in my 20s too. Not even gfs but friends and relatives too. They never talk to my side of the family for 30 years but all of a sudden, since they know we are more wealthy now, they have sO many problems that Only We can solve. Lol", "That\u2019s just one story. We have tons of homeless people because there is no where here to live. And they are hungry. I bring oranges or apples, if they need a dollar I give it. People who have the least help other people the most. We look out for each other"]}
