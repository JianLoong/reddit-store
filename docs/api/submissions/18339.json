Anyway, this afternoon we went to a family gathering with my wife\u2019s side for a few hours. We had planned that after this event we would spend the night at my BIL\u2019s house in the next town. That being said, a couple minutes before we are to leave for BIL\u2019s my MIL starts whispering in my 6yo\u2019s ear about how she should spend the night at her house instead. Never had anyone thought to include me in the conversation about where my daughter would be spending the night, so you know what I said when they finally brought it to me as we were walking out the door? I said, \u2018Nah. We can stick with the plans we\u2019ve already made. She can stay with me, my wife, and her siblings.\u2019\n\nSo my 6yo\u2019s in tears because Daddy\u2019s the bad guy, my MIL is snapping about how she \u2018Never gets to see her grandkids\u2019 (even though we\u2019d just spent the afternoon together and we\u2019d made plans to see her in the morning tomorrow too) and my wife is calling me rigid and inflexible (even though she also didn\u2019t like the idea because she didn\u2019t want to take the time to unpack my daughter\u2019s clothes and toothbrush and whatnot and give them to MIL when we were just trying to leave) and my son is crying because he doesn\u2019t like to hear disagreements.\n\nI\u2019ll admit it- maybe it wasn\u2019t even about tonight. Maybe it was about the last time my MIL came to our house she invited her sister to join us for dinner without telling me or my wife. Or maybe it was about the Facebook posts she makes about my children. Or maybe it was about all those times my wife has been in tears on our ride home from MIL\u2019s because she\u2019s been nitpicked to death about our parenting. Or maybe, just maybe, it was about all the antivax do-your-own-research nonsense MIL preached at us all pandemic long. Whatever the reason, tonight I said no and it felt good.\n\nSad truth- I know this woman talks so much shit about me behind my back, and I know it because I\u2019ve walked in on it. A couple years I overheard her hissing that \u201cIt\u2019s time ProjectsAreFun started taking some responsibility for once.\u201d (Keep in mind I work full time, change at least half the diapers, never miss a bedtime story, and am the only one standing between my children and tooth decay.)

Your MIL is still trying to control and manipulate things in her favor. Her whispering to your daughter instead of asking you first is just wrong. I would keep saying no and setting form boundaries.

She sounds manipulative.", "NTA. Both parents obviously need to be consulted before telling a child they can do something. The extra info proves that your MIL is consistently an asshole, but is unnecessary for deciding about this particular instance.", "NTA. \n\nI absolutely hate when people say \"part of being an adult is being around people that wrong you / letting bad behavior slide, etc\". F*ck that. Part of being an adult is setting boundaries & NOT tolerating those people / that behavior. Part of being an adult is respecting urself enough to not surround urself with that crap. \n\nWhat ur MiL (and wife) did was wrong. MiL more than wife tho. I agree with others that u should talk to ur wife after yall get to ur home & are calm. While we have an understanding of he deals with his family while I deal with mine in my house, when needed we back each other up or handle the situation as needed. \n\nWhich is what you did in this case. For u to have to play bad guy is a sh*tty position to be in but it's what's best for ur daughter. MiL was being manipulative & knew it.

An adult asking a *child* to have a sleepover (or do anything outside of the established plan), without even consulting the parents first, should be an automatic \u201cno.\u201d Your wife is enabling your MIL\u2019s behavior.

No adult (grandparent or otherwise) should be making plans with a *6 year old* without even consulting the kid\u2019s parents first.

She's constantly looking for approval and validation from her mother.  She's walking on eggshells and it 'hurts' her to think her mother is angry at her.  Basically the victim of a narcissist.\n\nHer dad is likely her mom's enabler or is just as bad as her.j\n\nMaybe sit down with your wife and have a real heart to heart chat with her about what exactly is going on and what your wife really needs.  She's looking for something from her mother that she will never get.\n\nYour MIL is trying to use your daughter against both of you.  It's a common tactic.  You are aware of what's happening and your MIL doesn't like it.\n\nDo some research on narcissists and show your wife.  You may need to be picky about what you show her and when (she doesn't need to be overwhelmed).  Find out what she wants ie mothers approval, and then gently tell her it may never happen.  And that your priority is her well being (and you hate what your MIL is doing to her) and the safety of your kids.  Remind your wife you don't want your kids exposed to the same manipulation and hurt your wife was subjected to by her.  And yes that will happen.\n\nIt may be valuable for your wife to have some therapy with someone well versed in narcissism to unpack her childhood and help with some strategies to move forward.\n\nThe best outcome is a happy wife and kids that aren't living with the fear of the lack of approval by your inlaws.", "NTA, but your kid is getting old enough to include her in such decisions like a sleepover for them.
