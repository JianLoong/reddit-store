Anyway, this afternoon we went to a family gathering with my wife\u2019s side for a few hours. We had planned that after this event we would spend the night at my BIL\u2019s house in the next town. That being said, a couple minutes before we are to leave for BIL\u2019s my MIL starts whispering in my 6yo\u2019s ear about how she should spend the night at her house instead. Never had anyone thought to include me in the conversation about where my daughter would be spending the night, so you know what I said when they finally brought it to me as we were walking out the door? I said, \u2018Nah. We can stick with the plans we\u2019ve already made. She can stay with me, my wife, and her siblings.\u2019\n\nSo my 6yo\u2019s in tears because Daddy\u2019s the bad guy, my MIL is snapping about how she \u2018Never gets to see her grandkids\u2019 (even though we\u2019d just spent the afternoon together and we\u2019d made plans to see her in the morning tomorrow too) and my wife is calling me rigid and inflexible (even though she also didn\u2019t like the idea because she didn\u2019t want to take the time to unpack my daughter\u2019s clothes and toothbrush and whatnot and give them to MIL when we were just trying to leave) and my son is crying because he doesn\u2019t like to hear disagreements.\n\nI\u2019ll admit it- maybe it wasn\u2019t even about tonight. Maybe it was about the last time my MIL came to our house she invited her sister to join us for dinner without telling me or my wife. Or maybe it was about the Facebook posts she makes about my children. Or maybe it was about all those times my wife has been in tears on our ride home from MIL\u2019s because she\u2019s been nitpicked to death about our parenting. Or maybe, just maybe, it was about all the antivax do-your-own-research nonsense MIL preached at us all pandemic long. Whatever the reason, tonight I said no and it felt good.\n\nSad truth- I know this woman talks so much shit about me behind my back, and I know it because I\u2019ve walked in on it. A couple years I overheard her hissing that \u201cIt\u2019s time ProjectsAreFun started taking some responsibility for once.\u201d (Keep in mind I work full time, change at least half the diapers, never miss a bedtime story, and am the only one standing between my children and tooth decay.)

Your MIL is still trying to control and manipulate things in her favor. Her whispering to your daughter instead of asking you first is just wrong. I would keep saying no and setting form boundaries. Talk to your wife.  Remind me her of how her mom makes her feel. It will be the same damage to your children and worse bc you won't be there to mediate.", "NTA\n\n>Tonight my wife said I need to grow up and let go of these times I\u2019ve been wronged because that\u2019s what healthy people would do.\n\nSpoken like a true doormat or enabler of AHs.", "NTA. But you waited too long to get these people in order. You have a wife & MIL problem & it's influencing your children. Your wife is a pushover. Time to regulate, EVERYONE.", "NTA for not wanting to change plans.  You might want to have a calm chat with your wife about your feelings and agree on some boundaries so it doesn't turn into a fight when it inevitably happens again.", "\u201cBe the better person\u201d and all that b.s. Yeah, fuck that. That just means that you should let assholes like MIL walk all over you. I think not. NTA", "NTA and the MIL was in the wrong to recruit your daughter into her plot to manipulate you and your wife into caving to her demands. I'm sorry you have a wife and MIL problem. Please try to gently steer your wife to see a therapist to learn how to establish healthy boundaries with her mother.", "NTA. How can you let go of past infractions when she hasn\u2019t changed??? Stick to your guns. Talk to your wife. You need to be on the same page and not buckle under pressure.", "NTA. If MIL wanted your daughter to stay over, she should have asked THE PARENTS, not tried to get her hyped up about it without any permission first (and as you're walking out the door). She sounds manipulative.", "NTA. Both parents obviously need to be consulted before telling a child they can do something. The extra info proves that your MIL is consistently an asshole, but is unnecessary for deciding about this particular instance.", "NTA. \n\nI absolutely hate when people say \"part of being an adult is being around people that wrong you / letting bad behavior slide, etc\". F*ck that. Part of being an adult is setting boundaries & NOT tolerating those people / that behavior. Part of being an adult is respecting urself enough to not surround urself with that crap. \n\nWhat ur MiL (and wife) did was wrong. MiL more than wife tho. I agree with others that u should talk to ur wife after yall get to ur home & are calm. While we have an understanding of he deals with his family while I deal with mine in my house, when needed we back each other up or handle the situation as needed. \n\nWhich is what you did in this case. For u to have to play bad guy is a sh*tty position to be in but it's what's best for ur daughter. MiL was being manipulative & knew it. She's lucky u didn't pop off worse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
