TBH, I can see both sides. I have a cousin, (who is like a nephew to me.) His child was born in April and he actually turned 18 two months later. The money I'd saved for his college fund had to go to support his family. And I still wonder if I was wrong to give it to him because he still hasn't managed to educate himself? Did I help him when he needed it? Or did I prop him up temporarily, so he could fall down later? (I still really am not sure.)\n\nIts hard to support what you believe to be a dysfunctional situation. You will love and be happy to be around the baby, of course. But, its hard to ignore that you would never have wished this for the child you are *still* raising. It's one of those things that's always complicated, I guess? No matter how much you love your kids, you don't want them to have kids before they're ready to be responsible to them?\n\nI have never once told my nephew anything about how I truly felt. I believed there was no place for that kind of rejection. But, its not like I was ever happy about what occurred. *We* just all had to deal with *their* choices. But, if you told me down the road that I could see your kid for 30 or 40 minutes on Christmas, and drop off gifts and leave - I wouldn't be at all hurt. I just wouldn't buy gifts. I wouldn't keep calling and I'd watch you manage your affairs from a distance.

Although you are not handling it the best way imo. Threatening to tell your child that she can\u2019t see grandma and grandpa because they don\u2019t like that mommy and daddy love each other is kinda proving their point on maturity. \n\nI would go have a heart to heart with them by yourself. They may just be saying these things due to the way they were brought up to think. They obviously still care since they are making an effort to spend Christmas with you. It is worth a try to tell them that you understand why they were worried initially. And then point out the positives that have come along with your daughter and your marriage. I would tell them that you want them to have a positive relationship with their granddaughter and it is very important to you. Then say that you just don\u2019t want the negative comments because it is hurtful and you don\u2019t want your family to feel stress when they come over. \n\nIdk. Tbh life is short. And I get it your parents are not acting in the best way. But my parents were pretty negative when I had my first baby because we weren\u2019t married yet. And when they gave unwanted advice I would just nod and agree or say that\u2019s something to think about, but just do it my way anyway. Although my parents were grumpy boogers they still had a relationship with my kids. My dad recently passed away and I have fond memories of him with my children.\n\nMost likely your parents aren\u2019t going to change. But you can\u2019t let their opinions get to you. You know you are a good parent and them saying you were too young doesn\u2019t change that. I would try the heart to heart and encourage you to keep them in your child\u2019s life. But also to redirect negative comments instead of taking them to heart and dwelling on them. Sometimes you have to let things roll off your back. Also maybe make them feel valued. Ask questions like dad, how did you get manage to get the Christmas lights up every year? Or mom, what did you do if we didn\u2019t want to try new foods? You don\u2019t have to follow what they say, but give them a chance to give valuable advice instead saying the same old comments. Maybe you\u2019ve been so apt to prove you aren\u2019t too young and don\u2019t need any help or advice that they feel left out and they are not needed.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA what kind of grandparents still complain about you giving them a grandchild six years after the fact poor Lola", "NTA", "How is giving them a limited window of time to visit in any way an asshole move when they bring nothing but negativity into what is shaping up to be a lovely life by the way OP describes it?

What, he should just let them come over, stay all day, and be terrible to him and his girlfriend without consequence?\n\nFor that matter, why should he nod and smile and shine them on about their advice (although, for the record, it doesn't sound like they're giving advice so much as just outright criticizing him and his girlfriend)?  Just to keep the peace with two people who are too mired in their own preconceptions that they can't take their heads out of their asses long enough to actually support their kid when he's doing everything (seemingly) right?  \n\nAt the end of the day, respect and feeling valued is a two way street.

They need to move on, and support you, if they want a good relationship with you. \n\nYou're not the 'asshole' for most things here (including setting boundaries). But you would be highly in the wrong for telling Lola her grandparents 'hate that Mom and Dad love each other'. That is very inappropriate and damaging to Lola. You do not involve children in adult conflicts, and you especially don't involve them in extreme concepts such as 'hate' within the family. Children's brains aren't developed enough at her age, to emotionally process such a threatening idea ('hate' within the family). And when children can't emotionally process something, it damages them. \n\nThat's using her as a pawn, to punish your parents. And if you truly want her to maybe have a relationship with them in the future, you'd be putting her in an impossibly stressful situation. How would she have a positive relationship with them in the future, when she believes they 'hate' her parents' relationship? Children derive a lot of security from their parents' relationship, so that makes them a huge threat in her mind. \n\nChildren also tend to blame themselves during conflict - and so believe family members hate/are angry at them also (i.e. she'd likely believe - even if you don't actually tell her, your parents disapproved of her birth - that she is hated for being part of the love between you and Paige/your immediate family).\n\nI'm hoping you just said what you said to your mother, in the heat of the moment. I can't encourage you enough, not to damage your child just so you can feel vindicated against your parents. You should make an excuse for why your parents aren't coming - or at most, tell her you've just had a little argument which you are trying to work out with them (and even that would be stressful for a child her age).

You can do either no contact or very limited, supervised contact with the warning that if they say anything negative, they don't get to have contact in the future.

The kid is here now, both parents seem to do fine, and the grandparents need to accept that or just not bother at all.", "They've had six years to help, and it sounds like they still only bring hostility. How long should OP wait for them to get over it and find (as you put it below) healing? How long should their daughter have to listen to her parents being talked down?", "Yeah just tell them to F off and cut them out of his life forever. That will be a great thing to do\u2026\n\nAnd yes saying give me presents then leave is an AH move. I wasn\u2019t saying let them be terrible without consequence. But sometimes it\u2019s worth the effort to keep people in your life especially parents. I\u2019m guessing before this they had a good relationship, otherwise OP would have mentioned previous abuse. It\u2019s real easy to tell a stranger to cut their parents off. It seems worth it to me to try not to have it come to that.", "Setting a time limit isn't AH behaviour. It can be a key boundary if people are known to make rude comments, to reduce visit times and then extend them again once trust is built that they will control themselves and behave better. If they can't behave for 2 hours, they don't get to visit for 2 hours. You increase visit times where no rude comments are made, you decrease them when they are. \n\nIt helps you change the relationship dynamic and establish that rudeness won't be tolerated without having to cut the parents off completely.\n\nSaying they 'likely won't change' isn't helpful because yes, they likely won't, if you set no consequences or restrictions, because there will be no motivation to change then. The point of setting limits is that it provides that: you don't like the limits, you stop doing the things that mean limits have to be set.\n\nBecause anyone can change if they want to.\n\nBut they never will if you refuse to hold them accountable in ways that matter to them.\n\nAnd your ideas of 'not taking things to heart' or 'let things roll off your back' don't and never have worked. When things are said to you repeatedly over and over and over, it is human psychology that you start to believe it is true.\n\nAnd if he had a good relationship with his parents especially prior to this, how in the hell do you expect him to genuinely not take it to heart then that people he loves think he is an incapable moron? It's hurtful and he can't stop finding it hurtful just because you tell him to. Being told hurtful things actually can make you MORE sensitive rather than less sensitive over time and make it harder and harder to bear.\n\nThis is also even true physically. Scars are often more sensitive to pain than normal skin tissue.", "I didn\u2019t see them reach out. I didn\u2019t hear anything about wanting to apologize and move forward from the past", "I'm sure it doesn't have to last. But they need to demonstrate a willingness to change first; they haven't done so under the current circumstances, so perhaps different circumstances are needed. Why should OP keep allowing himself, his partner and his daughter to be hurt by them?", "NTA. Your daughter is only too aware of how her grandparents see her... A mistake. That is unforgivable and needs to be dealt with yesterday!\n\nIf they can't leave the past where it belongs, then they belong in the past.\n\nYou've both done excellent with your daughter and I really hope that the thought of lack of contact with your little family is enough for them to pull their heads out of their arses.", "I\u2019d put her question right back to her- she wants to know when *you* will drop your animosity? What about hers?\n\nIt\u2019s time for an adult discussion about boundaries. You can tell them that you know and understand why they were so upset when you became a teen parent. But that was 6 years ago. You and Paige took responsibility, committed to be good parents and are raising a beautiful little girl. If they want to continue to have a relationship with the three of you, it\u2019s time to leave the past in the past. You are adults now. You\u2019re being responsible. And their criticism and snide comments are detrimental to your relationship. Like any new parent (regardless of age), you\u2019re figuring it out as you go. You don\u2019t need their nitpicking and it\u2019s not helpful or kind. So either they quit the snide comments, or they see a lot less of you, Paige, and most importantly- Lola. They can shape up or lose out- just like you had to.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit to add: one exception to the ruling though- if you tell Lola that she doesn\u2019t see them as much because they hate that you and Paige are in love, that you make Y T A. Don\u2019t do that to a child. That\u2019s manipulation and not the right way to handle it.", "NTA. \n\nThey\u2019ve done this to themselves.", "My question is whether OP has discussed the reason with his parents. He's 23/24 so may just be annoyed internally but not voiced it. Definitely NTA but worth an adult discussion going forward.", "I\u2019m glad someone else said this. It would be fucked up. Be honest with the kid when she\u2019s old enough to handle it, if the need arises, don\u2019t traumatize a 6 year old and make the argument out to be about something it\u2019s not.", ">If this \"confrontation\" happened(/happens) in front of the child.  How is the best way to explain it to the kid so it isn't damaging?  \n>  \n>*Lola, honey.  Grandpa and Grandma sometimes get mad about things that aren't their business?*  Would a six yr old understand that?", "If my daughter had a baby at 17 of course I would devastated for what I perceive as a loss of the future I had hoped for her.  But after six years, making it work and raising a happy little girl, I would be so unbelievably proud. The sadness would of course still be there, but if I were to do what OP\u2019s parents are, bringing up a mistake over and over and over again every single visit for 6 years running - I\u2019d consider myself lucky I could even come and say hello.  It\u2019s a terrible way to behave towards two people who have made the very best of a difficult situation.", "I have always been proud of my nephew even while I was scared to death about his choices. So, I get you. I think people latch onto a disagreement and that's all they see - not what was actually written? I am not for rejection of your child. No way I am in favor of that. And I certainly have not lived that way. But, OP's mom is reaching out. He can ignore her. He can seek pay back for the past six years even. Its not what I was saying at all. But, why are we ignoring that his parents are reaching out right now? What happens to the baby girl when her parents need some help from grandma and grandpa? (All families are different but common at the same time. Me saying that babies are not something anyone in my family cares if you withhold comes from the fact that I have 8 freaking siblings. My own grandmother had more than 50 grandchildren. We hardly notice that one is missing at a family gathering because out at the farm, the landscape is covered with our kids racing about. If someone told my mom that she'd never see their child again? My mom wouldn't even flinch. \"Works for me honey. Have a good time.\" And she'd walk away laughing to herself and not lose sleep. She's raised 9 kids. She's worn out. \ud83e\udd23)", "I don't think you are wrong. I just wonder what happens when OP needs them. That was what my speculation was all about. My young nephew has a young family himself. (And I've explained that ad nauseum.) But, I don't need anything from him. He, however always needs some assistance, most of it financial. He is certainly a competent parent. And I have always admired how he committed to the task at 17 and he's raising happy children. So, even while I am still sometimes fearful of what these choices will bring next - I KNOW HE'S A GOOD DAD.\n\nThe problem is that they are always financially behind the 8 ball. So, he oftentimes needs real financial help. (I just signed an apartment lease for the family because my nephew and his wife have poor credit.) Again, what happens when OP needs help? If he has no healthy relationship, then he should just struggle?\n\nAgain, this is not about his parents from my perspective, even though I get his rancor. I was musing about what is supposed to happen when he can't pay the light bill, or needs groceries, or even school fees?\n\nI never need a financial hand out. But, my nephew does. If he could not come to me or would not - does the need just disappear?", "\u201cBut it\u2019s TRUE, 6 year old! Why are you crying?!\u201d", "You know this isn\u2019t your nephew though right and your nephew isn\u2019t the blueprint for ALL young parents.", "Fair enough, I see where you're coming from. In this case, it sounds like they have good support from the gf's side of the family, so they can afford to be a bit more selective about what they're willing to put up with. Hopefully OP's parents will take this as the overdue lesson that it is, and stop hanging on to their earlier misgivings.", "Personally, I'd rather chew off an arm than beg bread from anyone. So I get that. BUT, I agree. I thought that his mom reaching out to him about Christmas was at least a step in a better direction? He doesn't have to reach back, certainly. I just pray he never *needs* her help. And that's why the fallacy of acting like he'll never \"need\" them for anything is confusing to me. His parents were awful in the past. But, that doesn't mean OP will never need anything from them. \n\nI just told someone that I recently signed an apartment lease for my nephew, his wife and their (now) three little kids. Neither of the adults had credit good enough to secure the living space. But, my nephew has always done everything he could to provide for his family. He even went into the military and did his hitch and did it well.\n\nHe has never made the money sufficient to have a livable life. He was 17 when his first child was born and he made minimum wage. He is a great dad and he has a SAHW who is a rather brilliant parent herself, IMO. No one can be angry with them for what happened long ago. *But, we still find ourselves needing to be of assistance.* \n\n(They would be living in my home right now, except they have cats. The cats aren't negotiable for nephew's wife and my husband is deathly allergic to cats. So, all I'm saying is that even when you are working it together and glad to help - its not like young families have all these resources to manage all their needs.  I'm not even thinking OP needs to forgive his parents. I said it was easy enough to see how parents in this situation can make mistakes because they fear the future. And if you tell them to kick rocks, that's fine. But, it doesn't mean you will never need anything from them.", "I guess this is where a cost/benefit analysis comes in: is the potential help worth putting up with the parents' hostility, especially when they have another set of (grand)parents who have stepped up?\n\nOP can't change the fact that he became a parent at 17; his parents' awfulness, though, hasn't stayed in the past, but continued into the present, according to the post. One party in this is holding a grudge, and it isn't OP - he's trying to move on.", "They don't seem to be behaving with hostility now? Unless I just missed that part? (And trust me, I accept that I may have missed present bad acts in my reading?)", "ESH. Instead of telling your daughter that \"they hate that mom and dad love each other\" you need to set boundaries with your parents. Don't involve a child in adult issues and risk her possibly believing it is her fault in the future.", "NTA.\n\nIt is absolutely fine for you to limit your and your daughter's exposure to toxic negativity.\n\nYou will drop your \"animosity\" when they drop their constant criticism. That should be pretty easy for them to understand.", "Nta. And it\u2019s so sad that they aren\u2019t PROUD of you for being great parents and staying together even though having a kid at 17 is fucking hard. They don\u2019t have to love how it started but they should realize that you\u2019re doing well and have grown up well", "NTA They had their reasons for being upset at the time, but that is in the past. They need to let it go. You did not hurt anyone and your relationship and daughter are doing fine. If they cannot treat your family with kindness, you don't want that attitude around your child. Going low contact would be advisable until they get an attitude adjustment.", "NTA", "Increase that toxicity by a factor of 10 as essentially OPs parents problem is that Lola **exists**\n\nIf they are always saying this kind of stuff 6 is plenty old enough to already have some serious trauma from those kinds of statements.  It would likely make sense to get Lola in to see a therapist even if you aren't seeing any outward signs of issues.", "That cuts both ways. Because they can't recognise their son is now an adult with a family of his own, they are continuing to lecture him as if they have any say over his life. Yes, grandparents can be a great help but they've got local support from the wife's family. And give it 20-30 years, it may not be him that is needing the help or questioning why they never get to see their grandchildren.", "They don't sound helpful at all, though...", "A lot of things that are true are not appropriate to tell young children.\n\nThreatening to emotionally abuse a child is never a good threat to make."]}
