And if your parents can\u2019t let their anger and frustration over what \u201ccould have been\u201d go, they don\u2019t need to be a big part of your life.", "NTA.

My and my SO\u2019s parents were miserable and manipulative. We didn\u2019t want my child to be exposed to that so we cut them off. What you are doing is commendable and for your child.

At 6 years old she can understand mean behavior and how people don\u2019t want to be treated badly. You could turn this into a good lesson about saying no to people who are mean to her.", "NTA. Pretty much every parent would tell teens they should\u2019ve waited to have kids, but your parents need to get over it. They are still holding a grudge and criticizing you after 6 years. It\u2019s time to have a very honest conversation saying you wished their relationship with their grandkid was t like this, but you are not going to subject your child to people who make rude comments about her parents. Plus, your daughter is old enough to pick up on the tension in the room and that has to be uncomfortable for her.", "It is extremely toxic to Lola to be around adults who argue, fight, criticise, and look down on her parents.

Tell them specifically that you don't want to relitigate the same arguments.  Then the ball is in their court.  \n\nIt must be hard, and it makes sense to be bitter, but I would encourage you to give them a chance.  It's hard to change when you are old, but it would be nice to see them put in an effort I think.", "NTA as Lola is of an age where she'll pick up on the tension and it'll sink in.\n\nHowever, I think you need a better way of explaining why they're not coming over if she asks. That screams of using her as an emotional blackmail tool and isn't mature. Your relationship with them may yet improve, but if you put ideas like that in her head at this point it could damage any she might have with them.", "nta - good for u setting up the boundaries.", "NTA The fact that they're still so obsessed years later over something that can't be undone makes me think they wish you 2 would fall apart -- they would rather have that happen than be wrong. Keep your distance from them. Congratulations on becoming mature, responsible parents.", "NTA.  No one needs that kind of negative crap.", "NTA. Were they right to be upset that their teen son got a girl pregnant? Sure. It is six years later and you two are still together and it sounds like you are being good parents so they need to lighten up and you have every right to not want to be judged and criticized. Also do they say these things where your child can hear them?", "Nta", "I\u2019m gonna split my vote because you have provided valid points. Yet, there\u2019s a bigger dynamic than what you mentioned. I\u2019m gonna say NTA for speaking up for yourself but maybe it\u2019s time (geez it\u2019s been 6 years) to sit down with your parents and have a real conversation about what\u2019s bothering you. Because if you don\u2019t, then you might BTA for limiting Lola\u2019s time with them. Look beyond your needs and think of Lola\u2019s. The more people she has in her life who love her and cherish her, the better. And she shouldn\u2019t have to suffer because you have an issue with your parents. I get that the issue is real. But try to work it out b/c if you don\u2019t YTA.", "[deleted]", "I don't think YTA. But, I don't think you are showing good judgment either. TBH, I can see both sides. I have a cousin, (who is like a nephew to me.) His child was born in April and he actually turned 18 two months later. The money I'd saved for his college fund had to go to support his family. And I still wonder if I was wrong to give it to him because he still hasn't managed to educate himself? Did I help him when he needed it? Or did I prop him up temporarily, so he could fall down later? (I still really am not sure.)\n\nIts hard to support what you believe to be a dysfunctional situation. You will love and be happy to be around the baby, of course. But, its hard to ignore that you would never have wished this for the child you are *still* raising. It's one of those things that's always complicated, I guess? No matter how much you love your kids, you don't want them to have kids before they're ready to be responsible to them?\n\nI have never once told my nephew anything about how I truly felt. I believed there was no place for that kind of rejection. But, its not like I was ever happy about what occurred. *We* just all had to deal with *their* choices. But, if you told me down the road that I could see your kid for 30 or 40 minutes on Christmas, and drop off gifts and leave - I wouldn't be at all hurt. I just wouldn't buy gifts. I wouldn't keep calling and I'd watch you manage your affairs from a distance. (Babies do not come at a premium in my family because there are soooooo many of us.) \n\nI understand your hurt, certainly.

As the parent of a seventeen year old, I can completely empathize with your parents\u2019 initial reaction.

They've had the opportunity to see their grand-daughter for 6 years, I'd say they are the childish ones, still going on with their views from when she was first born.

Next time 2 weeks etc.", "Well telling them to drop the gifts off and stay for 30 minutes is being an AH. But not wanting negativity is not being an AH. Although you are not handling it the best way imo. Threatening to tell your child that she can\u2019t see grandma and grandpa because they don\u2019t like that mommy and daddy love each other is kinda proving their point on maturity. \n\nI would go have a heart to heart with them by yourself. They may just be saying these things due to the way they were brought up to think. They obviously still care since they are making an effort to spend Christmas with you. It is worth a try to tell them that you understand why they were worried initially. And then point out the positives that have come along with your daughter and your marriage. I would tell them that you want them to have a positive relationship with their granddaughter and it is very important to you. Then say that you just don\u2019t want the negative comments because it is hurtful and you don\u2019t want your family to feel stress when they come over. \n\nIdk. Tbh life is short. And I get it your parents are not acting in the best way. But my parents were pretty negative when I had my first baby because we weren\u2019t married yet. And when they gave unwanted advice I would just nod and agree or say that\u2019s something to think about, but just do it my way anyway. Although my parents were grumpy boogers they still had a relationship with my kids. My dad recently passed away and I have fond memories of him with my children.\n\nMost likely your parents aren\u2019t going to change. But you can\u2019t let their opinions get to you. You know you are a good parent and them saying you were too young doesn\u2019t change that. I would try the heart to heart and encourage you to keep them in your child\u2019s life. But also to redirect negative comments instead of taking them to heart and dwelling on them. Sometimes you have to let things roll off your back. Also maybe make them feel valued. Ask questions like dad, how did you get manage to get the Christmas lights up every year? Or mom, what did you do if we didn\u2019t want to try new foods? You don\u2019t have to follow what they say, but give them a chance to give valuable advice instead saying the same old comments. Maybe you\u2019ve been so apt to prove you aren\u2019t too young and don\u2019t need any help or advice that they feel left out and they are not needed.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA what kind of grandparents still complain about you giving them a grandchild six years after the fact poor Lola", "NTA", "How is giving them a limited window of time to visit in any way an asshole move when they bring nothing but negativity into what is shaping up to be a lovely life by the way OP describes it?  I wouldn't want that shit in my home for any longer than that, there's no guarantee they're going to remain civil.  What, he should just let them come over, stay all day, and be terrible to him and his girlfriend without consequence?\n\nFor that matter, why should he nod and smile and shine them on about their advice (although, for the record, it doesn't sound like they're giving advice so much as just outright criticizing him and his girlfriend)?  Just to keep the peace with two people who are too mired in their own preconceptions that they can't take their heads out of their asses long enough to actually support their kid when he's doing everything (seemingly) right?  \n\nAt the end of the day, respect and feeling valued is a two way street.  They're giving him neither.  He should be (and seems to be) setting hard boundaries and doing what's right for him and his girlfriend and kid, and I applaud him for that.", "What makes you think his parents would even help if asked?  Asking them for help only reinforces their shitty unchanging view that he and his girlfriend are terrible parents who deserve to be second guessed at every opportunity.

OP's parents are lucky OP and gf are still in their lives.\n\nNTA", "Their daughter is old enough to be picking up on the grandparent's disapproval. And old enough to pick up she is the cause, if not the specifics.

People reaching out with poor intentions deserve to be pushed away.", "First of all, it sounds like OP has had a long, hard slog with his parents for the last six years; nothing new there except he might lose a bit of stress not having to hear their harping.  Second, he can be right *and* be happy.  He is right, in fact.  He and his girlfriend have, if her parents' opinion can be used as a barometer, turned out to be good parents.  He and his girlfriend are making it work and still committed to one another.  So he's right, his parents need to get off their bullshit.  That choice is on them, not him.  He'll be happy either way: with a loving set of supportive parents at his back, or no contact with people who make his life more difficult with their negativity.
