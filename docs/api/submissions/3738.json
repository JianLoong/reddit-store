TBH, I can see both sides. I have a cousin, (who is like a nephew to me.) His child was born in April and he actually turned 18 two months later. The money I'd saved for his college fund had to go to support his family. And I still wonder if I was wrong to give it to him because he still hasn't managed to educate himself? Did I help him when he needed it? Or did I prop him up temporarily, so he could fall down later? (I still really am not sure.)\n\nIts hard to support what you believe to be a dysfunctional situation. You will love and be happy to be around the baby, of course. But, its hard to ignore that you would never have wished this for the child you are *still* raising. It's one of those things that's always complicated, I guess? No matter how much you love your kids, you don't want them to have kids before they're ready to be responsible to them?\n\nI have never once told my nephew anything about how I truly felt. I believed there was no place for that kind of rejection. But, its not like I was ever happy about what occurred. *We* just all had to deal with *their* choices. But, if you told me down the road that I could see your kid for 30 or 40 minutes on Christmas, and drop off gifts and leave - I wouldn't be at all hurt. I just wouldn't buy gifts. I wouldn't keep calling and I'd watch you manage your affairs from a distance.

Although you are not handling it the best way imo. Threatening to tell your child that she can\u2019t see grandma and grandpa because they don\u2019t like that mommy and daddy love each other is kinda proving their point on maturity. \n\nI would go have a heart to heart with them by yourself. They may just be saying these things due to the way they were brought up to think. They obviously still care since they are making an effort to spend Christmas with you. It is worth a try to tell them that you understand why they were worried initially. And then point out the positives that have come along with your daughter and your marriage. I would tell them that you want them to have a positive relationship with their granddaughter and it is very important to you. Then say that you just don\u2019t want the negative comments because it is hurtful and you don\u2019t want your family to feel stress when they come over. \n\nIdk. Tbh life is short. And I get it your parents are not acting in the best way. But my parents were pretty negative when I had my first baby because we weren\u2019t married yet. And when they gave unwanted advice I would just nod and agree or say that\u2019s something to think about, but just do it my way anyway. Although my parents were grumpy boogers they still had a relationship with my kids. My dad recently passed away and I have fond memories of him with my children.\n\nMost likely your parents aren\u2019t going to change. But you can\u2019t let their opinions get to you. You know you are a good parent and them saying you were too young doesn\u2019t change that. I would try the heart to heart and encourage you to keep them in your child\u2019s life. But also to redirect negative comments instead of taking them to heart and dwelling on them. Sometimes you have to let things roll off your back. Also maybe make them feel valued. Ask questions like dad, how did you get manage to get the Christmas lights up every year? Or mom, what did you do if we didn\u2019t want to try new foods? You don\u2019t have to follow what they say, but give them a chance to give valuable advice instead saying the same old comments. Maybe you\u2019ve been so apt to prove you aren\u2019t too young and don\u2019t need any help or advice that they feel left out and they are not needed.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA what kind of grandparents still complain about you giving them a grandchild six years after the fact poor Lola", "NTA", "How is giving them a limited window of time to visit in any way an asshole move when they bring nothing but negativity into what is shaping up to be a lovely life by the way OP describes it?

What, he should just let them come over, stay all day, and be terrible to him and his girlfriend without consequence?\n\nFor that matter, why should he nod and smile and shine them on about their advice (although, for the record, it doesn't sound like they're giving advice so much as just outright criticizing him and his girlfriend)?  Just to keep the peace with two people who are too mired in their own preconceptions that they can't take their heads out of their asses long enough to actually support their kid when he's doing everything (seemingly) right?  \n\nAt the end of the day, respect and feeling valued is a two way street.

They need to move on, and support you, if they want a good relationship with you. \n\nYou're not the 'asshole' for most things here (including setting boundaries). But you would be highly in the wrong for telling Lola her grandparents 'hate that Mom and Dad love each other'. That is very inappropriate and damaging to Lola. You do not involve children in adult conflicts, and you especially don't involve them in extreme concepts such as 'hate' within the family. Children's brains aren't developed enough at her age, to emotionally process such a threatening idea ('hate' within the family). And when children can't emotionally process something, it damages them. \n\nThat's using her as a pawn, to punish your parents. And if you truly want her to maybe have a relationship with them in the future, you'd be putting her in an impossibly stressful situation. How would she have a positive relationship with them in the future, when she believes they 'hate' her parents' relationship? Children derive a lot of security from their parents' relationship, so that makes them a huge threat in her mind. \n\nChildren also tend to blame themselves during conflict - and so believe family members hate/are angry at them also (i.e. she'd likely believe - even if you don't actually tell her, your parents disapproved of her birth - that she is hated for being part of the love between you and Paige/your immediate family).\n\nI'm hoping you just said what you said to your mother, in the heat of the moment. I can't encourage you enough, not to damage your child just so you can feel vindicated against your parents. You should make an excuse for why your parents aren't coming - or at most, tell her you've just had a little argument which you are trying to work out with them (and even that would be stressful for a child her age).

You can do either no contact or very limited, supervised contact with the warning that if they say anything negative, they don't get to have contact in the future.

The kid is here now, both parents seem to do fine, and the grandparents need to accept that or just not bother at all.", "They've had six years to help, and it sounds like they still only bring hostility. How long should OP wait for them to get over it and find (as you put it below) healing? How long should their daughter have to listen to her parents being talked down?", "Yeah just tell them to F off and cut them out of his life forever. That will be a great thing to do\u2026\n\nAnd yes saying give me presents then leave is an AH move. I wasn\u2019t saying let them be terrible without consequence. But sometimes it\u2019s worth the effort to keep people in your life especially parents. I\u2019m guessing before this they had a good relationship, otherwise OP would have mentioned previous abuse. It\u2019s real easy to tell a stranger to cut their parents off. It seems worth it to me to try not to have it come to that.", "Setting a time limit isn't AH behaviour. It can be a key boundary if people are known to make rude comments, to reduce visit times and then extend them again once trust is built that they will control themselves and behave better. If they can't behave for 2 hours, they don't get to visit for 2 hours. You increase visit times where no rude comments are made, you decrease them when they are. \n\nIt helps you change the relationship dynamic and establish that rudeness won't be tolerated without having to cut the parents off completely.\n\nSaying they 'likely won't change' isn't helpful because yes, they likely won't, if you set no consequences or restrictions, because there will be no motivation to change then. The point of setting limits is that it provides that: you don't like the limits, you stop doing the things that mean limits have to be set.\n\nBecause anyone can change if they want to.\n\nBut they never will if you refuse to hold them accountable in ways that matter to them.\n\nAnd your ideas of 'not taking things to heart' or 'let things roll off your back' don't and never have worked. When things are said to you repeatedly over and over and over, it is human psychology that you start to believe it is true.\n\nAnd if he had a good relationship with his parents especially prior to this, how in the hell do you expect him to genuinely not take it to heart then that people he loves think he is an incapable moron? It's hurtful and he can't stop finding it hurtful just because you tell him to. Being told hurtful things actually can make you MORE sensitive rather than less sensitive over time and make it harder and harder to bear.\n\nThis is also even true physically. Scars are often more sensitive to pain than normal skin tissue.", "I didn\u2019t see them reach out. I didn\u2019t hear anything about wanting to apologize and move forward from the past", "I'm sure it doesn't have to last. But they need to demonstrate a willingness to change first; they haven't done so under the current circumstances, so perhaps different circumstances are needed. Why should OP keep allowing himself, his partner and his daughter to be hurt by them?"]}
