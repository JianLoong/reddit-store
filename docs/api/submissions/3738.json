They were right to be upset and worried when you had a kid at 17 because most people who have kids that young have a hard time handling the responsibility. You guys were the exception to the rule. Your parents need to accept that. You beat the odds. You are loving, responsible parents. And if your parents can\u2019t let their anger and frustration over what \u201ccould have been\u201d go, they don\u2019t need to be a big part of your life.", "NTA. While your parents are  allowed their opinion, they need to move on, it's been 6 years and they only seem to want to focus on negatives and if anyone is showing animosity, it's them - that is not a good environment for your daughter to be around.", "Ahem, and I want you to read this and understand: NOT THE ASSHOLE\n\nWhat you are asking for is completely reasonable. \n\nTbh they should count their lucky stars you aren\u2019t cutting them off completely. My and my SO\u2019s parents were miserable and manipulative. We didn\u2019t want my child to be exposed to that so we cut them off. What you are doing is commendable and for your child. The kiddos are what it\u2019s all about and you don\u2019t want that negative energy around for the holidays. They need to get their act together", "Mostly NTA. It\u2019s not helpful for Lola to see her grandparents arguing and being critical of you. It sounds like any time Lola spends with your parents isn\u2019t quality time. \n\nYou\u2019re a teeny tiny bit T A if you tell Lola that the reason her grandparents aren\u2019t around as much is because they hate to see you and Paige in love. At 6 years old she can understand mean behavior and how people don\u2019t want to be treated badly. You could turn this into a good lesson about saying no to people who are mean to her.", "NTA. Pretty much every parent would tell teens they should\u2019ve waited to have kids, but your parents need to get over it. They are still holding a grudge and criticizing you after 6 years. It\u2019s time to have a very honest conversation saying you wished their relationship with their grandkid was t like this, but you are not going to subject your child to people who make rude comments about her parents. Plus, your daughter is old enough to pick up on the tension in the room and that has to be uncomfortable for her.", "It is extremely toxic to Lola to be around adults who argue, fight, criticise, and look down on her parents. She will notice. It will not be good.", "INFO: Do your parents make these criticisms of you/Paige in front of Lola or can she hear them?\n\nHow frequent are the comments? One every once in awhile, pervasive part of most conversations, etc \n\nHave you ever spoken to them about how the comments make you feel and asking they not make them?", "I don't think you are the asshole, but if you want your parents to be in their grandchildren's life YOU need to communicate the boundaries and rules.  Tell them specifically that you don't want to relitigate the same arguments.  Then the ball is in their court.  \n\nIt must be hard, and it makes sense to be bitter, but I would encourage you to give them a chance.  It's hard to change when you are old, but it would be nice to see them put in an effort I think.", "NTA as Lola is of an age where she'll pick up on the tension and it'll sink in.\n\nHowever, I think you need a better way of explaining why they're not coming over if she asks. That screams of using her as an emotional blackmail tool and isn't mature. Your relationship with them may yet improve, but if you put ideas like that in her head at this point it could damage any she might have with them.", "nta - good for u setting up the boundaries.", "NTA The fact that they're still so obsessed years later over something that can't be undone makes me think they wish you 2 would fall apart -- they would rather have that happen than be wrong. Keep your distance from them. Congratulations on becoming mature, responsible parents.", "NTA.  No one needs that kind of negative crap.", "NTA. Were they right to be upset that their teen son got a girl pregnant? Sure. It is six years later and you two are still together and it sounds like you are being good parents so they need to lighten up and you have every right to not want to be judged and criticized. Also do they say these things where your child can hear them?", "Nta", "I\u2019m gonna split my vote because you have provided valid points. Yet, there\u2019s a bigger dynamic than what you mentioned. I\u2019m gonna say NTA for speaking up for yourself but maybe it\u2019s time (geez it\u2019s been 6 years) to sit down with your parents and have a real conversation about what\u2019s bothering you. Because if you don\u2019t, then you might BTA for limiting Lola\u2019s time with them. Look beyond your needs and think of Lola\u2019s. The more people she has in her life who love her and cherish her, the better. And she shouldn\u2019t have to suffer because you have an issue with your parents. I get that the issue is real. But try to work it out b/c if you don\u2019t YTA.", "[deleted]", "I don't think YTA. But, I don't think you are showing good judgment either. TBH, I can see both sides. I have a cousin, (who is like a nephew to me.) His child was born in April and he actually turned 18 two months later. The money I'd saved for his college fund had to go to support his family. And I still wonder if I was wrong to give it to him because he still hasn't managed to educate himself? Did I help him when he needed it? Or did I prop him up temporarily, so he could fall down later? (I still really am not sure.)\n\nIts hard to support what you believe to be a dysfunctional situation. You will love and be happy to be around the baby, of course. But, its hard to ignore that you would never have wished this for the child you are *still* raising. It's one of those things that's always complicated, I guess? No matter how much you love your kids, you don't want them to have kids before they're ready to be responsible to them?\n\nI have never once told my nephew anything about how I truly felt. I believed there was no place for that kind of rejection. But, its not like I was ever happy about what occurred. *We* just all had to deal with *their* choices. But, if you told me down the road that I could see your kid for 30 or 40 minutes on Christmas, and drop off gifts and leave - I wouldn't be at all hurt. I just wouldn't buy gifts. I wouldn't keep calling and I'd watch you manage your affairs from a distance. (Babies do not come at a premium in my family because there are soooooo many of us.) \n\nI understand your hurt, certainly. But, your righteous indignation seems excessive considering you don't want Lola to be a 17-year-old mom, do you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As the parent of a seventeen year old, I can completely empathize with your parents\u2019 initial reaction. However, after the shock had worn off, they should have worked towards accepting the situation and identified how they could best support you in becoming a parent so young. They chose to remain angry and negative and you do not need that in your life. Your daughter most certainly does not need that in her life.", "Why are they lucky he hasn't cut them off? If he does, he'll never be able to ask for help from them? And young people with little families oftentimes need help?", "From the sounds of the post he\u2019s brought this up before, including with this Christmas issue, and they aren\u2019t letting up. Why should they have to put up with that? Especially cuz if they\u2019re constantly bringing this up when they come over, they\u2019re granddaughter has already heard her grandparents being like this with her parents. OP\u2019s parents behaving like this WILL affect his daughter as well", "I think they've tried. OP said GF's parents love being grandparents but his just come over and spout their opinions. Lola's of an age where she'd notice the negativity.\n\nPerhaps they could extend it to Christmas Eve as a day but with a condition that they leave if they start with the same old argument. But that could end hostile.", "OP can easily replace his parents for 2 actual loving people in his village. Family is about more than biology.", "He has to? Why? So she can be subjected to hearing about how she was a mistake her parents made too early?", "He\u2019s given them 6 years! How much more chance do they need?!", "Because having the same conversation for six years is going to change the past? It sounds like they are saying this crap in front of Lola. In that case they are telling her over and over again that they wish she was never born. NTA", "So how long does he have to give them a chance? They've had the opportunity to see their grand-daughter for 6 years, I'd say they are the childish ones, still going on with their views from when she was first born. If they haven't bonded after 6 years, I'd say it is due to them and their inability to move on.", "You don\u2019t NEED the help. Grandparents aren\u2019t necessary they are a luxury.

From the good grandparents.", "My nephew had a baby before he turned 18. Grandparents have been that young couple's life's blood. They have three kids now and they still sometimes need a hand.", "Yeah and they were actually helpful. OP's folks have not been helpful and can't even come over and visit without having something negative to say. OP and his Girlfriend are not obligated to keep taking their shit at 6 years down the road.", "I really do hope they can find a healing though? What is he 22? 23? Its a long hard slog sometimes when you push people away after they've reached out to you. I do appreciate how upsetting this has been for him. I can't ignore that. I just hope it doesn't have to last? That's all. It hurts to read it. Its the same old question that still makes me tear up: *Would you rather be right? Or would you rather be happy?*", "Sometimes the right thing hurts but makes you happier than being wrong & exposed to negativity", "Sounds like OP wants to be happy, but his parents want to be right about them having a kid too young, so they refuse to let go of it and keep harassing him. It's a shame those grandparents refuse to be helpful or a part of a loving family, but it didn't seem to be in OPs control."]}
