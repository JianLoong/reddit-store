From your post it appears that you are leaving on reasonably good terms, not point in generating ill-will in your last few days.  If your replacement calls with any questions, just give very short answers similar to what you described in your post.  Finishing your project should take priority over last minute questions.\n\nI am also curious why you described yourself as being fired.  Usually when someone is terminated they leave immediately.  You have stayed on at least 3 months assisting with the transition.  Did your employer specifically say that you were being fired?  I would use different terminology when speaking with a prospective new employer.", "NTA, you were fired. Not your job", "NTA\n\nIf you have been fired, you no longer work there.

If you adequately trained him, it sounds like you are under no obligation to continue to train him. You are currently being paid to complete your project. \n2. It is not the new employees fault that you were under valued and under paid. You have every right to be upset- but do not take it out on the individual. If they have a question that you can provide a simple answer to, I think you should do it as a kindness to them.

I just received a message \"which invoices should I add in the submission\". My answer was \"everything there is in the folder\".\n\nYWBTA. If this is the first time he's doing something, it's perfectly reasonable/natural for him to have questions. That has nothing to do with him being qualified and everything to do with the fact that whatever his training/education is, it's not company specific. Not to mention he very well could have just been double checking\n\nBigger than that, you're blaming him for a company just acting like a company. The only way to get decent raises these days is to job hop. Staying at the same company for an excessive amount of time just gets you screwed", "In my opinion, if you ignored them, then YTA.

Your replacement is qualified and knows how to do the job but doesn't necessarily know the processes for your business. You spent 10.years at a company - of course your replacement is going to come in in more money. They have a qualification and a new perspective and are coming in at market rates. If the job was overworking you and you felt burnt out you should have advocated for yourself.  You are punishing a worker instead of the company.", "Is the company paying you to train your replacement? Then YTA. \n\nIf you are no longer with that company then be smart about it.

Your post leaves this mildly questionable as to how long you were working and being paid to fulfill adequate training. \n\nEverything else, the pay difference, their education, etc is a non issue really.  The issue is you and the company and this person, despite how the company chose to be better for is in no way at fault for these factors.  If this individual received insufficient training that you were paid to give, than they were harmed needlessly.  Sadly the company should have been cautious with their expectations of you in light of their actions and it seems they trampled your boundries on the matter a lot.

It also sounds like you're saying this is the first time the company hired an actual account but clearly someone had to have been doing the work before he got there. If you weren't the right person to ask because that's not what you did, that's truly all you should say. Him knowing the proper way to do thing =/= him just ignoring the way things were done before.
