Your request is responsible but why are you footing the bill constantly. Your Girlfriend & her sister are TAs for mooching off you. In the name of fairness tell your girlfriend to start covering meals since you did the last X number of times. Next time ask for separate checks.

Absolutely not.", "Hello!  That's my take too.  The gf is the ah for mooching and double for expecting it to be ok for her sister as well.", "I mean maybe it\u2019s my fault. She offers but I\u2019m usually very insistent on paying, I don\u2019t mind paying for HER. I love HER. Paying for her sister is a different story", "It\u2019s always something specific.

If your GF gets upset that you won't buy her sister anything, you got a pretty big problem.", "Ah.\nWell then, I'd go straight to the source. Next time gf asks, buy sister the thing, then have a chat with her when you return. Maybe when your gf isn't around. Something along the lines of \"Hey, I do not mind buying you stuff every now then. Why don't you ask me? I hope I haven't done anything to make you feel as if you can't talk to me. I feel as if you either don't like me or like I'm being used when I buy things thinking they are for my gf when they're for you.\" Or maybe something along those lines that is polite *and* expresses your concerns.\n\nETA typos", "I hear you.  But you may have to treat your gf as a single mother.  Sounds like a package deal.  Especially if your gf has been raising the sister", "Wait.... Son?  Does she also insist on something for her son?", "She hasn\u2019t been raising her sister. Her parents also live in the house. They all don\u2019t work. (Which is why I insist on paying most of the time, as the only person I have to support is myself) Except for my girlfriend who pays for most if not all of the bills, but that\u2019s an entirely different story. My dilemma was maybe I wasn\u2019t seeing it from her perspective. But I feel like her perception on the matter is already warped because she has been basically shamed into providing for basically her entire family that she can never say no to", "Ahhhhhhh.  Are you worried that the sister is taking after the parents, rather than the parents?", "This is very worrying and I can see the conundrum your gf is in. This will not improve and your gf will always be expected to look after her parents, sister and nephew and more and more and more. \n\nThere is a deeper long term issue here and I think it\u2019s best you sit down and have a very serious conversation with your gf. She needs to set boundaries with her family and stop allowing them to emotionally manipulate her into providing for all of them for all of their lives. \n\nI wish you all the best but you might find yourself having to break up the relationship before your gf finds the will to insert her backbone against her family.", "YTA\n\nYou say in the comments you're usually very insistent on paying, but your girlfriend offers, which is a very important detail to leave out.\n\nSo... that means on multiple occasions, your girlfriend goes to pay for everything, including the treat for her sister, and you insist that you be the one to pay?\n\nAnd then later complain that you weren't asked personally for the treat your girlfriend was going to pay for?\n\nKind of just seems like a weird desire for control.", "OP wrote- My girlfriend argued, it would be almost the same thing if I got it for her and she chose to share it with her sister. Could it be your girlfriend told her sister that you both will get whatever for her so she doesn\u2019t ask now, she just goes off the premise that you are ok with adding her items?", "NTA. Her little sister is 21 years old which means you is a grown adult who can afford to pay her way. Stop paying for you girlfriend. It's a nice gesture but she has started to take advantage and feel that she is entitled to spend your money on others without asking when you are a treating. She is showing you who she is and that is someone who will take advantage of others generosity.", "NTA \n\nStop paying for the sister.", "NTA. Sister is an adult. If she wants you or your gf to pick something up for her, she should have her wallet out as she is making the request.", "In the comments he mentions his gf subsidizes her entire family. I can see why he\u2019d want to pay for his gf in that situation. But the real problem seems to be the lack of boundaries gf has with her family", "I\u2019d take her up on the offer and see how she reacts when her sister asks her to keep buying stuff. NTA", "Next time let her pay, and buy stuff for your brother/friend without telling her.", "Wait. What? Why do none of these people work? So are you expected to work to pay for a whole family of other adults and your gfs nephew? I mean, is this what you want?"]}
