At this point it feels like I\u2019m constantly paying for 3 instead of 2 every time we go out somewhere. \n\nI told my girlfriend that if her sister wants something when I pay, she should at least ask me, because 9/10, I wouldn\u2019t mind. That\u2019s the thing, I really wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s just the principle. \n\nMy girlfriend argued, it would be almost the same thing if I got it for her and she chose to share it with her sister, my rebuttal was:\n\n\nNo, it wouldn\u2019t be the same thing because she would have never even got it if her sibling didn\u2019t ask.\n\nEDIT: I feel like as a lot of comments are going into the direction of \u201cshe never pays, she\u2019s taking advantage, etc.\u201d I thought I\u2019d interject for probably the first 6 months that we were together my gf (26) paid for a majority of things, as I was a full time student. I\u2019d insist on staying in, not getting something, but she\u2019d get it for me anyways and insist. \n\nSo I don\u2019t think her offers to pay are superficial at all, I truly believe them to be true. She has a good heart, which at times, can allow her judgment to be clouded I feel like.\n\nUpon graduating and making real money, that\u2019s what has led to me paying most of the time now. Just sort of a repayment back for what she did for me. \n\nI think the issue is more rooted in the fact that her sister expects me or her to pay every time she wants something, and the fact that my girlfriend sees no wrong in that.", "created_utc": 1680938359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12femyg/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_needs_to_ask/", "score": 491, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The obvious one: you could end up being the one supporting them all. And the more subtle one: if she's with you for financial support, her loyalty is tied to that need. If she stops liking you, she might not break up because it would leave her family in a tough spot. Or once that burden is lightened (sister becomes self-sufficient, parents die, family member wins the lottery), she might decide she no longer needs you.\n\nIt would be pretty telling if you let her pay more when she offers.
