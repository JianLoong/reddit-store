I explained to my husband that I wasn't comfortable with that because she was only a newborn. He said that he understood and would talk to his mother, but I don't think he ever did because she never stopped asking. \n\nThen, when my daughter was 2 weeks old, my husband said he was gonna go to the store and would take his mother and our baby with him while I took a shower. This changed to him letting his mother go ahead of him and take our baby with her and he'd catch up, then he sat down and never went at all. He reassured me that everything would be fine, that his mother would come straight back. He urged me to go take a shower and relax and I trusted his word, so I did. I was in the shower for 45 mins, when I came out, my MIL was back and my husband was holding our baby. I didn't know what it was, but something seemed amis so I asked if everything was okay, they both said everything was fine.\n\nThe next day, my husband and I went for a walk with our baby. We ended up bumping into his sister and she said she loved the surprise visit from their mother (my MIL) and our baby. I was bafflled and assumed she had bumped into them at the store near our house. But she clarified that my MIL had brought our baby over to her house for a surprise visit (my SIL lives about 0.7 miles away from our house). I immediately demanded an explanation from my husband and asked if he knew about this and when he was going to tell me. He explained that he had already addressed the issue with his mother when it happened and he was planning on telling me when we returned from our walk. \n\nI couldn't speak and I could barely think, I was boiling with rage! All I could think was \"how dare she!?\" My husband apologized and begged me not to do anything rash. I said \"you let your mother do this and were gonna hide it from me! When are you gonna pull your mother's nipple out of your f**king mouth and grow the f**k up!?\" He swore he was gonna tell me, but I didn't believe him and we returned home in silence. We all lived together and my MIL was sitting on the couch, she asked how the walk went. I ignored her, picked up my daughter, stomped up the stairs to my bedroom and slammed the door shut and locked it too. I texted my husband that he could sleep on the couch or even better sleep in bed with his beloved Mommy and to not talk to me unless it concerned our child. To avoid me and my anger he slept on the couch for several nights. I told him that his mother was NEVER taking our daughter ANYWHERE without one of us being there to supervise. And I warned him that, if he allowed this to happen again, he'll be single. And my MIL NEVER apologized to me!\n\nMy husband says I need to let it go because his mother is deceased, but this still makes me so angry and I still can't forgive her.

In her head, she probably thought it wasn't a big deal and wanted to show off your baby to her daughter.  It WAS definitely worthy of a conversation with your husband and her, but at this point you are holding onto a grudge for absolutely no reason.  It's been two years and you're posting about it on Reddit.  If you couldnt effectively communicate your feelings to your husband/MIL when she was alive, then that's on you.

Besides, it's not really about MIL. Op is still married to a person she can't trust.\n\nSafer to be angry at MIL than to think deeply about the marriage.

You need to attend therapy asap because whatever \u201cgrudge\u201d you\u2019re holding onto and what you \u201cthink you should get\u201d is irrational and will damage the relationship you have with your child as well.

I\u2019d lose so much trust for both of them. My baby is ten months and if my husband did this when he was younger I don\u2019t think I\u2019d currently be over it, it\u2019d be in the back of my mind anytime I had to leave my child and would make me paranoid as hell, which si the last thing a new mother needs. \n\nI do think you might want to talk to a therapist or something about this though.

Your MIL took your newborn alone to a location without your knowledge or permission. That's a huge deal. Your husband facilitated it, tried to cover it up, and lied to you. That's a serious betrayal.

If you're that angry, YOU go sleep on the couch.  \n\nYes, she took your kid without you knowing it.  But guess what?  Your husband knew and seemingly took care of it.  Do you not trust the father of your child to handle things concerning his child?  From your entire write up, it doesn't seem so.  He's dad, he can have a say and scold his mom for going against your wishes.  Then warn him that if he allows it to happen again that he'll be single?  He didn't allow anything.  From the information gathered, he let MIL take kid to the store, not sisters, and scolded his mom for it.  What did he allow?\n\nYes, newborns are fragile.  Yes, moms of newborns are still in hormone hell.  But that doesn't mean you go as nuclear as  you went here.  \n\nYou're still this angry at a dead woman.  You need to let this go.

My MIL would ask to take our daughter places everyday. I explained to my husband that I wasn't comfortable with that because she was only a newborn. He said that he understood and would talk to his mother, but I don't think he ever did because she never stopped asking. \n\nThen, when my daughter was 2 weeks old, my husband said he was gonna go to the store and would take his mother and our baby with him while I took a shower. This changed to him letting his mother go ahead of him and take our baby with her and he'd catch up, then he sat down and never went at all. He reassured me that everything would be fine, that his mother would come straight back. He urged me to go take a shower and relax and I trusted his word, so I did. I was in the shower for 45 mins, when I came out, my MIL was back and my husband was holding our baby. I didn't know what it was, but something seemed amis so I asked if everything was okay, they both said everything was fine.\n\nThe next day, my husband and I went for a walk with our baby. We ended up bumping into his sister and she said she loved the surprise visit from their mother (my MIL) and our baby. I was bafflled and assumed she had bumped into them at the store near our house. But she clarified that my MIL had brought our baby over to her house for a surprise visit (my SIL lives about 0.7 miles away from our house). I immediately demanded an explanation from my husband and asked if he knew about this and when he was going to tell me. He explained that he had already addressed the issue with his mother when it happened and he was planning on telling me when we returned from our walk. \n\nI couldn't speak and I could barely think, I was boiling with rage! All I could think was \"how dare she!?\" My husband apologized and begged me not to do anything rash. I said \"you let your mother do this and were gonna hide it from me! When are you gonna pull your mother's nipple out of your f**king mouth and grow the f**k up!?\" He swore he was gonna tell me, but I didn't believe him and we returned home in silence. We all lived together and my MIL was sitting on the couch, she asked how the walk went. I ignored her, picked up my daughter, stomped up the stairs to my bedroom and slammed the door shut and locked it too.

Including that he was going to tell OP \u201cafter the walk\u201d the next day, when if he really intended to tell OP he would have already done so.\n\nThere\u2019s not much point in holding a grudge against the MIL since she\u2019s dead, but her husband\u2019s pliability and ease of lying to her can still be a concern.", "I promise most mothers would go ballistic at the idea of someone taking their 2 week old baby anywhere without the mother knowing. That\u2019s a fragile point in time in which I personally need to know everywhere my child is. For safety (what if something happened?) also because what if mom was concerned about strangers being around her baby? If the mom takes the baby to places without mothers consent, then who is to say what random people might be at the location? Babies get sick very easily. It\u2019s just dangerous all around and unwarranted.", "OP clarified in comments she was mad about the lying, not the location.", "A parent being overprotective of a  2-week-old is pretty normal imo.", "My first worry was SIL or her kids weren\u2019t vaccinated. I was sure the post was going in that direction for a minute there\u2026", "My first worry was SIL or her kids weren\u2019t vaccinated. I was sure the post was going in that direction for a minute there\u2026", "Lmao I\u2019m looking forward to an adjacent r/tifu post from your husband later today", "You could have said \u201cI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny, I will never think it\u2019s funny, I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\n\nAll this shit about you not being able to forgive her, well good thing she\u2019s dead now and cannot ever receive your forgiveness am I right?!\n\nWhy the need to be continually, outwardly aggro about this one incident. It\u2019s his dead mom, just stop shitting on her and move on. It\u2019s childish, and YTA", "You might wanna add this to the post. The fact that he brought it up vs you just stewing on it AND that he thinks it\u2019s funny is pretty telling", "But it sounds like she did say it was ok just not to SIL", "This is the answer! She's angry at hubby - who never apologized nor even attempted to make it up to her. Heck just reading that I'M angry at her husband myself! He only ever says \"she's dead now, get over it\" never owned/owns his part in the mess.", "She knew MIL took the baby out alone.", "Dude, YTA and need to let it go. 0.7 miles is so close you\u2019re mad about nothing.", "NTA- in that case in my opinion, he made it much worse than lying to you by omission at the time. You don't lie about kid stuff.  It's not funny.", "This needs to be a part of your post! The problem is in reality he doesn\u2019t understand why you have a problem still because he likely never fully understood or cared why you were mad to begin with", "They had the fathers permission to visit his sister, he has rights too", "You only need to reply once.\n\nHer husband took care of things and already talked to his mother about it before OP walked down and found out.  He had it handled.", "Oh yeah. I get being mad but at some point you have to come to grips with yourself that no harm was done and no harm was meant. Like I do not get the trepidation that grandma had the kid with her at all. Like she thought she would do her harm. If she didn't think that then her anger is irrational.", "Also I don't think he ok a different destination. She just had done it. So at some point forgiveness is warranted. Nothing was done to or that would harm the child", "Decisions about the kid should be a two yes one no decision. If one parent says no then that should be it. Within reason of course and this was completely within reason", "Yes you do not have to forgive her you could absolutely forget she ever existed if you want to but you do need to work out that your husband was a part of that problem", "Sounds like it wasn\u2019t for necessity\u2019s sake they moved back. That\u2019s hardly something to be grateful for", "You clearly didn't read the comment before yours \ud83d\ude12", "OP and husband moved back in after beggin, and MIL still decided she can take OPs baby without letting her know\ud83e\udd28", "1) I meant to type \"lonely\" and I have corrected that 2) my daughter was 2 weeks old, I think that's plenty of clarification", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s controlling to want to know who has your 2 week old baby and where they\u2019re going.", "Not to mention the way that her husband and MIL basically tricked her into it. I agree that she needs to get over it now, but I completely understand why she was pissed to begin with.", "Store has more germs and crazies than SILs.", "She\u2019d happily infect the child going to the store with a million strangers around to do as they please but doesn\u2019t want her child to breathe fresh air and visit a family member that is going to actually take precautions because the family member wants the child safe?  She\u2019s controlling people then and controlling people now and it\u2019s the hill she wants to die on sooo let her", "Then she should take her irrational rage out on her husband instead of the MIL.", "Still doesn\u2019t make any sense to hold onto that for 2 years", "Which is interesting because no one actually lied.\n\nYes, there was information withheld, and given OP's reaction I think it's not hard to figure out why.\n\nI'm wondering how much verbal abuse people are used to experiencing from her.", "Especially a woman post-partum very valid feelings to have, even in retrospect that can look irrational or blown out of proportion", "She\u2019s controlling.  This isn\u2019t normal.  This will wreck her relationship with her child.  She\u2019s cutting off her nose to spite her face (I think that\u2019s the phrase)", "But is she aggro about it? It doesn't sound like OP brings it up or constantly harps on it. Her husband brought it up. There's nothing wrong with still not being ok with what happened. What would be wrong is if it still actively impacts OP's life.", "I had it in the original post, but I had to shorten it and leave that part out to get to the story. But you're right this is crucial information, I'll try to put it in somewhere", "She did not agree *at all*. Her husband made it happen, while he knew it was not ok.", "She did not agree *at all*. Her husband made it happen, while he knew it was not ok.", "The MOD of AITA don't allow more than 3,000 characters per post (including the title and spaces), so I left it out. Idk how to add it to the post", "He addressed the issue with his mother. Doesn\u2019t sound like he gave permission", "By that logic, it\u2019s my money too so I can go spend our life savings on whatever I want and my wife should just deal with it. \n\nIt\u2019s a marriage and we discuss things.  Doing whatever I want with important things and hiding it from my wife wouldn\u2019t make for a good relationship.", "Nah. That just lets one badly behaved parent lord their poor choices over the other.", "Absolutely not. That literally allows one parent to make the decisions. Fathers are parents too and reddit needs to accept it", "\u201cTwo yes, one no\u201d - yet another phrase completely overused by Reddit", "I wonder who inherited the house when she died. \ud83e\udd14", "I've been rereading both your comments and I don't see for the life of me what can be misread?", "I don\u2019t know where these people are from, but in my country we usually do go out with the baby nor allow lots of visitors until they\u2019re at least 3 months old.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for how you react back then, but YTA for not letting it go. It\u2019s been 2 years, she\u2019s dead, and (gladly) nothing happened to your child.", "If your daughter was 2 weeks old isn't it better that they went to SILs house instead of to the grocery store? I'm pretty sure it's recommended that your baby doesn't mingle with the general public for the first 7 weeks but I could be wrong (not a parent).", "Why isn\u2019t her husband capable of making decisions for his child?  Why did she have a child with someone she can\u2019t trust before the child has even entered the world?", "2 years ago was still closer to the pandemic plus the baby was a newborn- it is a lot risky to take the baby to a store than to 1 person\u2019s house depending on how responsible they are.  In general there are a lot more germs and people coughing and crap in a store then the one person in their house", "Oh please, you shouldnt be taking a TWO WEEK OLD baby anywhere without mom's permission, period.", "I will make that assumption that there is a reason why he didn't tell her upfront.", "I wonder how much money they saved while living there if they didn\u2019t inherit the house?  Who helped with the baby when dad was at work but mom needed a shower and it wasn\u2019t nap time?\n\nI can keep asking questions cause this is a fascinating case of someone want to control everything and it blowing up in their face", "No its not. Cant you see she only gave permission to the slave for only a trip to store. Then the Slave stayed home.", "Well I think it would be best if MIL hadn\u2019t tooken the newborn anywhere without mentioning it to OP. But I guess MIL is entitled to do whatever the hell she wanted", "But mother doesn\u2019t see it that way.  Poster believes the store is safer and that her husband can\u2019t make good decisions", "Yeah, he and MIL are shitty lol. Thats the reason. I\u2019m genuinely baffled at how many ppl think its fine to take a newborn somewhere without letting both parents know\ud83e\udd28", "The visit was lovely according to the sister in law. The whole outing was less than 45 minutes. \n\nVs\n\nStomping around angrily with a new born and locking them in a room and lashing out abuse to partner\n\nI know who I'd prefer my child to be with", "I know who I\u2019d prefer my child to be with too AND I wouldn\u2019t have a child with someone I can\u2019t trust.  So not only is she wrecking her marriage and not only is she going to raise a child that resents her because of her control issues no one but me can see it\u2026..  she needs therapy asap"]}
