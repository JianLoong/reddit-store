The gist was that a woman was in a relationship that involved an \"extreme\" form of domination. The coworker always, and I do mean always, referred to her bf as her \"master\".

Everyone knew, because you didn't have to ask her, she'd tell you or purposely bring up the convo to tell you. Her kink only related to heterosexual relationships.
