So, from my perspective, it was more beneficial to me to post \"publicly\". \n\nI can however, understand why someone wouldn't want to get in the middle of someone's relationship, but that's not what I was asking for.

Do I think he was living with and supporting me just to abuse me? In a sense, yes. What he was \"getting\" from me (besides love, compassion, etc.) was control over me, he seemed to crave the power of being able to control my emotions and psychological health. That's what narcissists live on. Why did he create a situation of eviction that would hurt him as well, just so he could leave me? Well, narcissists are also impulsive with money. I don't think he intended to get us evicted, I think he thought we were going to find another house to rent before that happened. He will often be overdrawn in the bank one day, and then the next he'll have 10's of thousands of dollars (he works in sales, makes large commissions). I don't think he planned on separating from me at all, until the moment he did. I'm actually not certain he understands that this is really over, he loves to play games and break up with me to illicit an emotionally response, and when he feels satisfied with the amount of \"punishment\" I've received, he starts love bombing and hovering me in again. Rinse and repeat. \n\nI'm sure it's very difficult for you to understand the motives of a narcissist, and that's a good thing! If you did, you might be a narcissist, too.", "Nobody wants to be put in a position of going against a friends partner only for them to turn around and continue the relationship.", "If they are emotional support animals then they can't be denied. All you have to do usually is get a letter from a therapist or a doctor stating that they are emotional support animals and you are required to have them. DV shelters have to honor that legally because they are dealing with DV survivors who has a lot of trauma that aren't always physical. If they try to sit there and say the animal has to be registered , be sure to say \"actually no, I only have to produce a letter from my doctor/therapist\". I'm pretty sure they can still emergency place you without the letter with the emotional support animals. They should give you time to get the letter for the accommodation. That's all the letter is for is a accommodation to be in a certain room (usually bigger) and to be out past curfew if you need to walk the dogs after curfew. I didn't know that and gave up my service dog when I skipped state after my ex called the cops on himself one night after he hurt me so bad that I stopped moving. I knew I had to leave before he made bail or the next time I would be transported in a body bag or missing instead of being transported through ambulance to the hospital. I didn't ask because I thought shelters didn't have to follow the law because it's well, a shelter. After I got to NY and started in with therapy, the therapist said I really needed a emotional support animal. After I told her I had given my ex boss my service animal because I can't have animals at the DV shelter, she said \"no, that's not true. If they were to try and deny you it would be against the law. Service animals AND emotional support animals are 100% protected in shelters. They just have to place you somewhere where you and the animal can be accommodated. That's a federal law in all 50 states.\". I wish I had known that before hand so I try to spread the knowledge.", "Thanks for the clarification. Humans are really complex and weird. Anyway, i wish a recovery of you from both cancer and mental trauma. Also, I hope you will be able to turn around your life.", "Sure, that's understandable, but no one asked anyone to go against anyone. I simply asked for help getting out of an abusive situation, first. Someone ended up telling him. I got abused further because of it. \n\nAfter that, I reached out to people I thought would want to help, like family members and close friends. No one was able to help, and some people didn't even believe me. After being abused and mocked further, I finally had enough and posted some of the things I was experiencing. A few people I hadn't considered messaging privately reached out to ME!", "Why did you copy/paste someone else's comment?", "Wow, thank you so much for that info! That really helps dispel a lot of anxiety I've had about that! \n\nIn so sorry you had to go through all that, especially without your service animal. I figured service animals would be allowed, but emotional support animals, because so many people abuse the system, would be a little trickier."]}
