So, after dealing with it for 2 years while going through and recovering from DA-REPOCH inpatient chemo, not being able to leave due to my illness and lack of funding or support, I finally broke and started posting his abusive texts and audio recordings from our security cameras on my social media stories.

I want to spend as much time as possible with him. He's been such a good dog and companion to me these last 12 years. He doesn't deserve to be abandoned by me at the end when he needs me the most.
