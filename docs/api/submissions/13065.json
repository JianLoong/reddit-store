She has really high expectations for being on a dating site. She\u2019s also at the age where attraction is number 1 for her and for some reason has a hang up with dating \u201cnerds\u201d. Either way you just pointed out that she likes nerd stuff just not hero nerd stuff lol", "Lol, her profile is nerdy, so she's attracting nerds. I died out laughing at your comment and woke my husband up. NTA", "NTA, if your sister wants an adult relationship then she should act like one lmao - not everyone you\u2019re intimate with is going to have the same interests, you can like some of the same things while remaining independent in your likes/dislikes. \n\nadditionally, expecting someone who doesn\u2019t have SOME kind of connection to those heavily culturally saturated media types is quite a weird hill to die on\n\nhow does that saying go? variety is the spice of life?", "NTA. Your sister should definitely be more open minded. \n\nMy dad is a Marvel and Star Wars fan. You could ask him questions about any of the characters and he could tell the answer in a heartbeat. Does he have posters of Iron Man displayed all over the walls? No, he does not. He doesn\u2019t even talk about Marvel movies unless he\u2019s asked. \n\nWith that being said, there are some people who are obsessed with stuff like that. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t understand where she\u2019s coming from, I just think her standards are a bit unfair.", "NTA\n\nHarry Potter and other nerdy shit in her profile probably won't attract ufc fighters on a dating app. Finding your perfect match is already hard, let alone when people don't even dare to give others a chance. \n\nShe wouldn't be caught dead with a marvel fan? Goddamn.. Why the hate. Sure I get not liking superhero movies, I don't either. But it's not like that shapes the entire person.", "NTA, it\u2019s fine if she has preferences but she should be more mature and considerate about her own case and situation if she\u2019s gonna find someone she likes.", "ESH.\n\nYour sister is a hypocrite, but I don't think confronting her and lauging at her at a family dinner was the right way to handle it.\n\nI think your mom is right and she probably should be more open-minded. Saying she wouldn't be 'caught dead' with a fan of superhero movies or anime is a little shallow, especially when she's going around binging sci-fi shows and visiting some tourist site made specifically for Harry Potter.", "ESH\n\nBased on her reaction, and your mother's support, it sounds as though you were just laughing at her.  Which is what you described doing lol.  Not the most helpful or supportive response.\n\nYou are not wrong that her profile would attract a certain type of guy.  But when your sister is complaining about how she is attracting the wrong type of guy, a more helpful response would be that you don't think her profile really shows her true self and interests, like running and UFC.  It instead is nearly all sci-fi and Harry Potter, which is giving guys the wrong impression.  There are studies on how changing your profile pic can massively change your matches on dating apps.  She should try changing hers to something that better shows who she is *and* the kind of man she is interested in.", "YTA. Just because you told the truth doesn't mean you have to do it in a rude way. But I get it, I have a younger brother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She won't get a match at all if she's not the top 5% of dudes.", "Nerd here! Battlestar Galactica/Harry Potter does not equal marvel/dc. I'm the world's most annoying vintage sci fi fan and I wouldn't want to hang out with a marvel dudebro. Your argument that because she's nerdy she should be happy to date anyone that you consider nerdy is like saying that because someone likes major league baseball, they should be ecstatic to go to a national hockey league game. YTA.", "NTA she brought up the topic herself and you were giving an honest critique. sure, the burst of laughter might\u2019ve caused her to be defensive, but really what you said was spot on. she puts on a geeky aura and gets geeks in return. she should give them a chance cause she might get lucky and find a geek who also works out.", "I know right.  Maybe I should Tell her that her Battlestar Galactica Halloween costume pics isn\u2019t helping her, even if she can pass as Starbuck.", "I think I may be guilty for that one.  Me and our other brother are big Marvel Fans ourselves and some of our friends have made it a personality trait.  \n\nOh shit.", "I think my sister is a massive hypocrite, don\u2019t get me wrong.  But I\u2019ve seen some of her Matches, and they would look ridiculous next to her.

If so, she's an even bigger hypocrite for matching herself with people she doesn't think are attractive.\n\nIt's all down to a personal preference though. If she doesn't find them physically attractive she doesn't have to match them or even care about them. But to be critical of people over their interests, when you yourself are the very thing you're critiquing, that kinda makes you a hypocrite.", "as the ugly guy: I don't know the woman I swiping right on, so I'm not going to decide for her if I'm to ugly for her. I found women are excellent at that themselves.\n\nBut what your sis need is a big dick Warhammer 40k gigachad.", "I\u2019m not sure how that site work, maybe I\u2019m mistaking it for guys who like her.  That would make more sense, right?", "Bumble works exactly the same as tinder the only difference is once there is a match the woman has to message first. So she is either 1. Matching with these people she apparently things are unattractive or 2. These are just people on the bumble feed because you can\u2019t see who has already swiped on you unless you\u2019re paying for it. So she\u2019s either being a massive hypocrite and AH or she\u2019s completely misleading OP and showing just random profiles that likely haven\u2019t swiped right on her to insult them and make herself look better.", "Did a bit of googling, looks like on Bumble, the woman makes the first move to match with a guy, and it's the guy's responsibility to either match back or respond in some way.\n\nThis looks a little better for your sister, but there's still that comment she made about hating nerds/geeks, despite being one herself. Like I said, I think she just needs to be more open-minded.", "She should, but I know her too well.  The only way I can see her going out with a Star Wars or a Marvel fan is if he\u2019s also into MMA or is also a first responder or both.", "Mine is a marvel fan, into aliens and all that stuff, not so much Star Wars, but is also into MMA and is a black belt in Jiu Jitsu.
