If they had the courtesy to wash my sheets, cool. Even if they didn\u2019t, it\u2019s still not the end of the world. That shits all psychological anyway, and I know I\u2019m not going to spend the rest of my days dwelling on the fact.", "Communicate and set expectations and boundaries _before_ - instead of exploding _after_.\nYour sister is in college - she has a bf and probably not a lot of private place if she has roommates. You could have expected this.\nAnd you know, a general 'don't bring anyone over' is acceptable boundary and you don't need to discuss details like 'you can't hook up in my bed, but I guess the shower is okay cause it cleans itself' (or whatever) for your peace of mind set a firmer boundary than what you actually need so you don't get upset even if it gets somewhat crossed. But just do it early on, don't expect people to read your mind or reddit to judge what is universally unacceptable behaviour.", "Tell mom, I would like to bring prostitute and have sex in your bed! See if she\u2019s OK and not over reacting", "NTA!\n\nI\u2019d be grossed out too! Tell your mother she can offer her bed to the young couple instead and see how she likes it :)", "NTA. I would also have an issue with a house sitter bringing someone else in to fuck on my bed. I asked you to water plants and feed animals, not fuck on my bed.", "NTA, probably.\n\nFirst if all, I'm not from Ireland, but I'm not sure why all these people are talking about it. Anyway....\n\nI get being grossed out by the thought of your sister screaming in ecstasy as bodily fluids are exchanged with wild, hot, passionate abandon. I mean, trying to get to sleep with your mind playing tricks on you like hearing echoes of dirty talk, or heavy grunting when you're just trying to count some damn sheep? That sucks... And speaking of...  Nm. You might be overreacting a bit, but you could pick up a cheap blacklight to make sure the ceiling above the bed is kosher. \n\nWhat if she promises to not go for the gold? I can't imagine that was an actual stipulation against sex, be it oral, vaginal, anal, 3-some, or involving acrobats or other \"circus stuff\".\n\nNTA (yet), but I'd lighten up. I mean, I was a little weirded out watching \"Lords of Dogtown\" when a bro and sis were having sex in different beds in the same room, but I mean, good for them! (Man... That's still nightmare fuel, and I don't even have siblings.) She's 19, powered by hormones, and exercising her right to get all sorts of jiggy with it. Ask her if she can promise to respect your wishes to not have (hopefully) awesome sex RIGHT WHERE YOU SLEEP.  If she can agree and you can trust her, that is your opportunity to not be the asshole.\n\nIn the meantime, you can get cheap sub-$20 shortwave uv lights at online retailers. They're also awesome for finding minerals that fluoresce, not just spunk and lubricant splashed on a surprising array of surfaces and objects in your room.", "I think the issue is you said she could stay there and she invited her boyfriend to stay. She should have had the courtesy to make sure that was ok first. NTA.", "You're completely overreacting, but you're NTA because it's your place, your bed, and you can dictate what you don't want people to do with it.", "NTA. She wasn't respecting your home.", "NTA even though I wouldn't care in your position. Your house your rules. I think a ban on her entering your house is pretty harsh. You were gone for weeks and knew she was staying over. BUT if I was her I simply would have not told you about having sex? I don't know, seems like y'all are too open and simultaneously too closed off.", "NTA, that's fucking gross", "Nta", "EW NOPE NTA\n\nListen I am so picky about my bed. This is just gross. NTA at all.", "NTA, that's incredibly disrespectful to you and your space.  You should make her buy you new sheets.", "NTA\n\nthats just nasty, they could\u2019ve done it anywhere else but on your bed? Who would even admit to doing that either..", "NTA, but maybe for different reasons.\n\nI don't necessarily think it's gross, considering that they had the decency to cleanup afterwards - so hygiene seems fine - though admittedly I'd rather just not know and have the peace of mind. But frankly what I think (and your sister + BF think) is irrelevant because you're allowed to have whatever boundaries or feelings you want about your own bed & apartment! What makes her the AH is that she's trying to police your reaction and your boundaries. And your mom is attempting to trample all over them as well. They both you an apology", "NAH. It's understandable to be grossed out by that fact, but also were I to invite a sibling or friend and their partner to stay at my house for a couple weeks while I was gone, I would assume that sex would happen there at some point. That's just what inviting a couple over for that amount of time kinda entails, and expecting them to refrain from sex without communicating that explicitly is a bit unreasonable. \n\nYou're not AH, but neither is your sister.", "DEFINITELY NTA. I do not at all want to think about my sister doing that stuff. And I definitely don't want to know I'm sleeping every night where she's done it. The sheets can be cleaned or burned and replaced. But you'll always know. That's just weird and unpleasant.", "No because you're allowed to set the rules/guidelines/boundaries for how you want your home to be treated whether you are in it or not.", "NTA And this needs no explanation. I\u2019d be tossing that bed as well.", "NTA.", "Nta, she finna be thinking different if that happened to her. Honestly its just nasty, like, ew lmfao. I would be mad n kick them out too so", "NTA. That is your private space. She was there to water plants and watch your cat. NOT invite her boyfriend over for a free night alone. \n\nTo be entirely considerate, at least she washed the sheets.", "Automatic NTA just from reading the title, I don\u2019t even need to read the rest to say it\u2019s beyond justified.", "NTA. She is disrespectful and if your mother said you're overreacting,  then we know where she learned it from (sorry, I know it's still your mother). \n\nI am for SE Asia, so no mind sex, even as much as kissing on the living room is counted disrespect, hahaha. But that's your bed, your own personal private space. She can't violated that with somebody's body fluid.", "NTA.  Just pay for a pet sitter the next time.   Tell your mom they can have sex in her bed, then.", "NTA remind your sister of all the nights you have enjoyed yourself in that bed with your laptop.  She will never go near your bed again", "NTA. I feel like it\u2019s an unspoken rule that unless it\u2019s a hotel you don\u2019t have sex in someone else\u2019s bed lol", "NTA", "NTA \n\nYou get to decide who has sex in your bed.", "Funny I always thought I\u2019d be in the right to not want people to screw in my bed. Looks like I\u2019m wrong.", "that\u2019s gross and the fact she announced it to you \u2026 NTA", "NTA. Yes, we stigmatize sex in America but to be honest, your sister had sex in your bed and to me, that's overstepping a boundary.", "NTA for being grossed out, but kicking her out? If you didn't make it clear to her beforehand that you don't want her fucking in your bed then you're YTA", "NTA. Boundary and respect issue. She's young so perhaps a very stern conversation would have been better than throwing her out, but honestly at 19 she probably should understand why that's skeevy. She's your sister for crying out loud so what she did was super weird. You're not some sexually repressed being for not liking this.\n\nEdit, if it was so normal she could have called and asked. She knew you'd say absolutely not.", "Yta she was staying in your apt for weeks. Do you think she was supposed to remain celibate during that time?", "People treat their bed like a weird coffin. That mattress is so full of dead skin cells, fecal matter, saliva and dna that it should gross you out. Hence we put sheets on it.", "So you're saying that they should have had sex on the couch instead? Odd, I would think that the bed linen would be the easier thing to clean.", "Yeah I feel the same way. I guess if I was letting someone with a partner house sit for a few days or longer, I would assume they\u2019re going to have them over. I don\u2019t want to know but I\u2019m not going to be naive about it. Good for them if they get a little privacy and a nice night together.", "I think there's a difference between living and staying. And then while staying, there's also a difference between using someone's bed and fucking in it. These are boundaries that have to be clear before doing anything and can't be assumed.", "literally my wife and me. when we go out of town, her younger brother housesits and his girlfriend comes over\u2026 they don\u2019t have a lot of privacy available in their living situations , and we have a washing machine. i don\u2019t dwell on it, but it\u2019s also not doing me any harm. \n\ni personally can\u2019t imagine expecting a teenager house sitting for me to do anything else.", "Same here. I don't have a sister so I imagined it like two good childhood friends, women, so I was annoyed, but once I realised OP is a guy I was even more disgusted...", "Knowing my own cum is in my mattress is very different from knowing MY SISTER'S CUM is soaked into it. Hello?? It's like seeing your own period stain on the couch versus someone else's. The way you react to your own bodily fluids are very different from your sister's I would hope. Getting your own piss on you is different from getting your sister's piss on you. Same with cum and sweat in your mattress", "Seriously! I was sitting here wondering if I\u2019m actually a terrible person for having sex in a friend\u2019s bed while cat sitting, really didn\u2019t think it was a big deal as long as you wash the sheets and don\u2019t do anything too freaky haha", "People are catholic for weddings, christenings and funerals. The times of Ireland being a catholic country run by priests and nuns are long gone. Sure some still go to mass regularly but the average person isn't living their life by catholic rules because they're afraid of going to hell. Not that long ago we voted in gay marriage and abortion.", "Is it normal to replace sheets that someone has had sex on instead of just washing them? I'm ace so I genuinely don't know, but I think if they were my sheets I would just run them through the laundry and have no further concerns.", "Respecting other people's privacy and personal posessions doesn't make you a prude lol.", "Never had sex in anyone's personal bed other than mine or my partner's. Wth how are so many people fucking in other people's homes?", "I lived in Dublin for a few years and people ask me the WEIRDEST shit about it. It's just a regular ass modern city, (though more beautiful and with uglier history than most) but a ton of my fellow Americans picture Ireland as being stuck in around 1750. It's wild!", "Ireland came forward. The US leapt back.\n\nEdit. Fat fingers.", "They\u2019re basically horny teenagers who have no privacy. I get it, but I don\u2019t want to think of my little sister getting dirty with anyone, period. Especially not in my bed.

But yeah, it's even worse to say so.", ">See, here's the thing, he was being nice by letting her stay there while house sitting.\n\nI just had to mention that no1 takes In account that she was also Being nice to agree too to go feed and water and stuff. That is not her responsibility either and should not be taken granted", "Totally plausible. I had a red-headed friend in high school who transferred in halfway through the year\u2026he convinced the entire school that he was from Ireland, and his lie wasn\u2019t revealed until the following year when his little sister started high school and told everyone he was full of shit. Ha", "My son used to work at one of those Brazilian steakhouses and he'd not only fake an accent but make up a country, culture, any answer to whatever questions a table asked him.   Nobody was ever like \"that's not a real place\".  He made great tips because he seemed exotic and Americans are bad at geography.", "I, (from Scotland) once had an American guy telling me he was Scottish too. He got very irate when I told him that no, he was not, he was American. \n\nIt got better when he told me he was about 5% Scottish because he did a DNA test and that his family were from Scotland in the 1500s. \n\nHe got even more annoyed when he tried to tell me that my name wasn't even Scottish and that I was a liar. I have my married name and my maiden name on my account. My maiden name is one of the oldest Scottish clans around. It was hilarious when I pointed this out. He backtracked like fk.", "YTA.  19 year olds make mistakes, and screw alot.  The deed is done, you never forbade it, its your sister, and nothing is gained by banning them", "YTA.\n\nPeople saying NTA keep bringing up boundaries but the thing about boundaries is you need to fucking set them! If you'd been like \"don't do this\" and she was like \"lol nah I'm doing this\" that would be shitty of her. \n\nIts fine to be grossed out by it but like you need to communicate that to her and give her a chance to acknowledge it, not immediately ban a family member from your house because she did something you don't like but others would be fine with.", "She\u2019s the AH, and very inconsiderate.", "NTA but you also should not be surprised. \n\nYou said she can stay for two weeks and okay with her bf being there. She is 19. Unless you were explicit you should have expected this from a 19 year old staying there for two weeks with her bf. \n\nYou are asking someone new to adulting to know better for two weeks. I would be surprised if she didn\u2019t have sex in your bed since you didn\u2019t tell her otherwise.", "YTA. What did you think was going to happen? She lives in a dorm with little privacy. It's not very hard to realize she was going to take the opportunity to use the privacy of your apartment. That is probably why she offered to help in the first place.  If you didn't want her banging in your bed, you should have said so before you left.", "ESH. You\u2019re not wrong to be upset about your personal boundaries being broken. But I think banning her from your home is taking it a bit far. Especially given her age (we\u2019ve all been young adults and made some questionable choices while still maturing), and the fact that she at least had the decency to wash the sheets herself. I\u2019d try revisiting the subject with her, and share that while you may disagree on your views on sex, it\u2019s ultimately your home and she needs to respect your boundaries.\n\nBut also, maybe have a little empathy for her. I\u2019m sure the temptation of an empty apartment was great in the face of her dorm room.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. There is a definite unspoken rule about your sister not banging someone in your bed. It's honestly common courtesy.", "People are comparing it to hotels and cruises? See in those cases you sign up knowing other people have had sex in those beds. Shouldn't have to deal with that in your own home!", ">I feel like it\u2019s a known rule that she shouldn\u2019t have even brought her bf over WITHOUT OP\u2019s permission\n\nWell, you know what they say about assumptions. We let people stay at our house frequently while on vacation and are always really clear about the ground rules. This is classic projection; you can't just ASSUME that people share your same values, morals, or world views.", "Doesn't sound like little sis even asked if it was OK to bring people over. I wouldn't even be happy with the boyfriend coming into my house when I'm not there, especially if I don't know him well.", "OP needs to tell mom to let baby sis do the deed in her bed. See how much she likes it then. NTA and that\u2019s disrespectful and gross.", "Yeah that's kind of how I feel. I don't think I'd kick someone out for it, but I would be grossed out by it and think it was rude. My bed is my little island of comfort, only I get to have sex in it. hahah", "Your own bed is a sacred place!  Lol", "Kinda wonder how the sister would feel if OP fucked someone in her bed and then told her it happened.", "100% the best comment! OP should tell his mom to get with the times and let them screw on her bed. I am sure that will change her outlook real quick.", "Dude, my first \"real\" bed was a nice BeautyRest....that was handed down from my gf's mom, to my gf's older sister, then to us. So much relative sex on that thing! We slapped a mattress protector on it and slept like babies...after having sex, obviously.", "Lmao for real - this comment section is wild", "It's def amusing seeing so many people upset over this!
