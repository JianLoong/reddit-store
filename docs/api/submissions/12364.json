He didn\u2019t mind her sleeping in the bed because that\u2019s his sister, but having sex in it crossed his boundaries.\n\nIt\u2019s not policing her. She could have had sex with her boyfriend at her dorm or her bf\u2019s place since it was stated by OP that she lives nearby.", "I don't think there is something wrong, in your case, you think that's cool, but it's so hard to understand that not everyone is ok with that? I find it disgusting, he finds it disgusting, why have sex in his bed it's necessary? That's not something everyone thinks is so cool. \n\nAnd mutually beneficial? He didn't know that part of the arrangement, that's the point. She could maybe think for a second, \"Is he ok with that? That is his bed\"", "Not even close to a good comparison", "Oh so now you have limits? Why sex but not a bukkake? Prude", "Whatever, gross person trying to justify gross things gets ignored. Troll someone else, go sleep in your friends bed or something, just stay tf out of my life lol.", "But OP didn\u2019t offer the bed to a COUPLE. OP offered it to their sister, not their sister AND her boyfriend, that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to tell you. Should OP have assumed that the boyfriend would probably come over, sure. But OP should have set the boundary that he wasn\u2019t allowed before hand, or OPs sister could have been an adult and asked if he could come over. Regardless, if I was OPs sister I wouldn\u2019t have had sex in my siblings bed. Not having sex with someone in your siblings bed is a pretty basic boundary that shouldn\u2019t need to be verbalized.", "Doubtful, im sure he's a clowshoes teen too.", "I am an Irish Protestant and I'd just like to say... Aye we are up til no good a fair bit of the time like, so fair play but who doesn't love a good ride, yeooooooo!", "I absolutely love coming across wild Father Ted references. Makes my day!", "i cackled!!", "This right here.", "Weird", "Bruh....I don't think anyone would be okay with their sister using their bed to hook up, regardless of who with.\n\nI know I'd be pissed off if my sister did that in my bed.\n\nIt's not trauma, but it is a violation of personal property and boundries.\n\nAnd this is from someone that can't stand how fragile society is today.\n\nDon't use my bed to sleep with someone. And at least ask first, don't just assume you're allowed \ud83d\ude02.\n\nEdited spelling mistakes.", "In OPs personal bed- that\u2019s the OPs personal space, hence the violation.", "Where you live? \n\nImma go fuck in your bed.\n\nYou never said it was a boundary, bro.", "It's pretty reasonable to not want people fucking in your bed lol. It's a matter of basic decency, most people I'm aware of wouldn't be happy in this situation either.\n\nIt wasn't her home, she was there to do a few chores as a favor to OP. If her boyfriend had just come to hang out that'd be fine, but them failing to keep it in their pants in his home was disrespectful.\n\nIf I hired a pet sitter I really don't care if their partner comes over to watch a movie or something. I care a lot if they decide to use my place as if it was their's and start fucking.\n\nIt's a matter of respect and is a pretty standard expectation, OP shouldn't need to tell them that any more then he should need to tell them not to piss in his sink.", "It\u2019s shouldn\u2019t have to be said if you have common courtesy, common sense and respect for other peoples spaces as a **guest** in their house. Siblings or not you just don\u2019t do that. A literal no brainer. \n\nAre you saying if someone asks *you* to house sit, you\u2019re going to invite someone over while they\u2019re away, without their consent or knowledge, and just go at it ?\n\nEDIT: I need to add that the top question is actually a concerned thing. *Are you fucking in other peoples\u2019 beds, without their knowledge?*", "If boundaries hadn\u2019t been set they couldn\u2019t be crossed", "Please get off the computer and interact with actual people.", "You do you and I'll do me. I don't want anybody else banging it out in my own personal bed. Period. End of story.", "Your username probably makes people wary to discus sex and family with you...", "I was actually reading the rules earlier today. AITA is not a debate sub. It's a discussion of personal opinion to either tell OP they suck or tell them their family is crazy.", "I generally don't think my sister is going to fuck on my bed, yet you think OP is an AH for \"making a rule after the fact.\"", "It was expected *sister* would sleep in the bed, not *sister and company*, big difference. My sister can sleep in my bed, her boyfriend *cannot*.", "clearly you seem to lack basic manners at other peoples home, because YOU SHOULDN'T FUCK IN OTHER PEOPLES HOME WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION. just because YOU don't have any issues with other people bodily fluids around you home, doesn't mean OP should.", "Nah fam she sucked me dry.", "That is exactly what I would expect.  New beds and shaking things up a bit.  Especially though for someone young who normally lives in a dorm.", "At least now I know where NOT to go when looking for a pet sitter", "Even if a fleck of shit fell out of someone's ass, you would never know in your life. If that is the standard for being grossed out, you should probably stop visiting your parents house. I can promise everywhere you sit, a tit has been, a cock has been sucked, and some slobber has probably drooled out.", "God almighty I hope you never use a hotel then if that's how youre approaching this.", "This isn't a privacy issue in any shape or form.\n\nIf she hadnt washed the sheets Id have more sympathy but this really is nothing to be mad about, certainly not enough to kick her out over.\n\nSpare me the armchair speculation and engage on the point next time.", "For real. Im literally sitting next to my sister and I asked if she would ever fuck someone in my bed while me and my husband were away. She looked at me disgusted and \u201csaid absolutely fucking not. Who does that?\u201d", "I guess that if he\u2019s grossed out by it, he could have mentioned it before leaving.  \n\nThat\u2019s why communication is so important.  Because not everyone has the same feelings on this kind of topic.  \n\nLearning how common it is for folks to be bothered by it, I think I might need to write a list of people to apologize to!", "You responded to me, so\u2026?", "Yeah exactly.  He is a horny teen from another country that is dating an American girl.  American girls think any guy with a European accent is smarter than the average American guy just because of their voice.  Dude knows what he is doing lol", "What does clowshoes mean? I've never heard that before.", "Not really. I don't want my naked body all over someone else's sheets. I don't know who slept in them before me.", "She's not a pet sitter and she wasn't there just to do chores. She was sleeping in the bed overnight. If you let someone sleep in your bed, you can reasonably expect them to do bedroom activities there. What if she rubs one out in the bed solo? Is that also a breach of \"basic decency?\"\n\nAgain, OP is mad \\*because he found out,\\* not because it happened. If she'd never said anything, this wouldn't be an issue.", ">Are you saying if someone asks you to house sit, you\u2019re going to invite someone over while they\u2019re away, without their consent or knowledge, and just go at it ?\n\nAbsolutely the fuck yes? If you know someone is going to be sleeping in your bed, you should have a reasonable expectation that bedroom activities may be taking place.\n\nI have no idea where you weirdos are getting the idea that not having sex in people's beds is some time-honored matter of common decency. If you have guests staying in your house, you just assume they humped in the bed, wash the sheets and move on with your life like an adult. If you don't like it, don't let other people sleep in your bed.", "I\u2019d advise you not interact with other people.", "Boundaries are important in real life, too, though.", "That doesn\u2019t answer the question if it is then ok in your mind for people to have sex when they stay in someone\u2019s guest room", "Nah, they could just not reply then. People exclaiming they dont want to be debated just want the last word.", "Lmao had me in the first half", "I think they are for kicking them out over it yeah, they over reacted and she'd done them a favour house sitting.", "Yeah next time my husband and I stay with my in-laws, I'll be sure to ask them permission before we have sex at night. They washed the sheets, there shouldn't really be a concern about fluids.", "Wait. So if my husband and I were going to house sit for someone for a couple weeks, we'd have to ask their permission to have sex while we're there? That's weird", "Tell me you get no action without telling me you get no action.", "Oh no i love that. I live for it. But you gotta be honest, that\u2019s a boundary that I wouldn\u2019t blame someone for placing. Also it\u2019s not a big ask. Like imagine taking down your pants and pissing just a tiny bit on your sister\u2019s pillow and then washing it and then explaining to them \u201cwell it\u2019s just a tiny drop of piss you\u2019re so easily grossed out UGH\u201d", "When you go to a HOTEL you KNOW other people have used the bed before you. Your OWN personal bed is a completely different story.", "Horrible troll", "Look, when you use someone else's things, you are the one who should ask permission or ask if the person agrees, not the owner of them, something simple that they teach you in preschool, now for something like that, it is logical that if you're going to have sex in someone else's bed, the one who should ask for permission is you. And yes, if you usually have sex in other people's beds, the least you should do from now on is let them know BEFORE LOL", "I know dude, someone had to tell you how gross you are being here and how low your standards must be to be siding with the sister. I did it for the people. \n\nSelf respect is free man. You should practice it sometimes.", "That\u2019s false. Young women aren\u2019t inherently dumb.", "\n\nJust another awkward kind of person.", "I mean it's of course fine for you to do that. It's not common though that people sleep in hotel beds with different attire than they would their own.", "MAYBE IF ITS A GUEST BEDROOM ! \n\nThen yes, absolutely. **Even the couch is a better option.** But not someone else\u2019s bed that THEY sleep in", "If a couple were guests in my home, I might expect that that kind of thing might happen.", "No fuckin in my house in my beds. If you want to, get a hotel room.", "You could just not reply to them? It's not like it's a big deal", "And was repaid by having a space for themselves for a few weeks instead of staying in a dorm.\n\nIt's common curtesy not to fuck in someone else's bed. Where the hell do you live that it isn't?", "your In laws are expecting you AND your spouse to arrive, and if they so wished, it would be reasonable they ask you to not get it on in their home. from what OP wrote i dont even think they knew her BF was coming over", "Exactly. Like it's so much weirder to ask another adult for permission to have sex in their home??? I can't imagine how creeped out I would be if a guest asked me that", "So if a friends let\u2019s you use their lake house, are you not supposed to smash uglies ?", "Tell me you have no manners, without telling me you have no manners", "The difference seems very arbitrary to me, its either gross and unacceptable or it isnt", "Im not the one calling people young or oblivious because I disagree with them buddy.", "Your right, but young people are inherently naive. Don't turn everything into a battle of the sexes.", "I firmly believe all young people are inherently dumb or at least naive until the age of 30 minimum..", "Is it sort of like how we say clown shoes? Is it an Irish/UK thing?", "Well at home, they have no attire so .....", "I figured, thank you for answering.", "That could be said for every comment on this sub tbh lol", "No, it would not be reasonable for them to ask that a couple not have sex in their home. It would be freakin' weird. \n\nPeople have sex. Get over it. The sister shouldn't have mentioned it but that's the only thing making her an AH here.", "well for one, sleeping on a guest bed is different that someone's personal bed. also, it literally doesn't matter what ANY of us think. Op was uncomfortable with their sister sleeping with someone on their bed, and considering its literally their property, have ever right ot be offended and not allow them back in their home. again, its simply rude to fuck on someones elses bed they sleep on every night.", "Yeah as long as you have basic manners I don't mind it, although I would consider part of those basic manners not talking about it (along with washing sheets, etc)", "a lake house bed that isnt someone regular bed is a FAR different that the bed OP sleeps in every night. that's a \"communal bed\" just like a hotel, entirely different expectations and assumptions.", "Do you let other people wear your underwear?", "And your still a bad troll", "oh i see, you took the missing 'n' and ran with it. Hope that gave you the dopamine boost of the day.", "My pleasure. I'm not some kind of prude. I mean look at my username lol \ud83d\ude05.", "I wouldn't have an issue with it. But I don't let other people wear my underwear in a hotel either. That's a silly comparison.", "Obvious flame bait at this point, report me to the mods if you feel that way then", "Actually, I was genuinely curious if it was a different saying since so many people all over the world use Reddit and I love learning all the different sayings and words used by other English speakers. I'm constantly learning new stuff I've never heard of. It wouldn't have surprised one bit of that was an actual completely different word/term.\nBut, way to be defensive I guess.", "Ngl I was looking at that when I first replied to your comment, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh \ud83d\ude06", "No, i am asking if you let people wear your underwear, or use your toothbrush in your home, that you paid for\u2026", "You aren't important enough to be reported.. you are just a gross person and it shows with your comments. Some people have higher standards and it is perfectly ok to have higher standards."]}
