They\u2019re buying a new mattress every time they have sex, regardless of whether it\u2019s a new partner. As soon as they find someone willing to have sex with them.", "It's been a big reminder the average age and life experience in this sub disqualifies any feedback from being relevant if the issue is to do with anything adult.", "So by that logic, he was fine with his sister laying in his sweat and cum (because I assume he has sex in that bed and according to everyone here they are very concerned with the mattress regardless of sheets) but not the other way around? \n\nThings may seep below sheets but you aren\u2019t sleeping on the mattress. You are sleeping back on a clean sheet", "Oh no, typo! I meant NTA!", "Why? It's her residence for the 2 weeks. She is sleeping in that bed, drooling on that bed, sweating on that bed.", "I was living with a ton of people and my aunt asked me if I wanted to house sit. They didn't have anything for me to take care of, just thought me and my bf would want a few nights of privacy. Was I wrong to assume they meant for knockin' boots? Cuz we did.", "Then tell her that. And not in front of her boyfriend as they are being kicked out of your house and being told she can\u2019t ever come back. She\u2019s your sister. Life is too short. If this was a reoccurring event I could see the reaction you had. By the sounds of it she was surprised by your reaction.", "Sex is not a normal bed activity other than in your own bed and at a hotel. That's just a normal human boundary. Sex is messy and gross, so you do it in your own home where you clean or somewhere you're paying for the cleaning.", "Isn\u2019t the sister also American?  Lol", "Spot on", "No, we don't, but it's a funny phrase. Trying to get your kids into a non catholic school is still a nightmare. It's still a catholic country. I don't know what the point of this comment is.", "I grew up in Ireland, no need to get into a back and forth to defend the country against whatever insult you perceive. It's not that serious a thread.", "Also TMI when I was told, but my sister once told me about her ex that refused to get naked in front of her. Always kept his boxers on for some reason. They were sexually active in spite of this quirk of his.", "So many women had to die to make that happen in Ireland.  Looks like we are heading down that road now.:(", "Only in the republic, not in the north.", "Yep. May Savita Halappanavar and every other woman who has died because of draconian abortion laws rest in peace.\n\nTheir governments murdered them. I'm just bracing myself for the reports of death in my country after Roe V. Wade's dissolution.", "Let\u2019s not pretend Ireland is some trailblazer here when it comes to abortions and divorces. \n\nAbortions were only legalised a few years back and a lot of women still head over to the UK to get one done.", "they were playing cards. \n\nnot poker, tho, def not.", "I was just thinking someone has to go in and feed/water things if he's gone for a couple of weeks so his sister is a better option than a stranger or a paid service... Although neither of those would f*ck in his bed... That he'd ever know about anyway...", "I agree. When my sister and her husband dog sat while I was on my honeymoon, I assumed they\u2019d have sex. I much rather them in my bed and wash the sheets instead of my couch. They of course washed the bedding. As did I before they came so they wouldn\u2019t have to sleep in my fuck sheets.\nBut for some, regularly having sex isn\u2019t for them.", "And did OP say anything about allowing people over? Much less let *them* sleep in his bed? Its her residence under certain conditions. \n\nYou think allowing someone to stay at your place gives them free reign to treat it as if its theirs? I doubt you would apply that logic if its your house and bed.", "Everyone knows not to fuck in someone else's bed then tell them about it.", "GOAT aunt right there.", "She did clean though.  The sheets were in the wash, and the only reason OP knows about the sexy time is because she asked and was told.  I would expect OP's sister not to do anymore favors for them, and also to not talk to them openly about anything else in the future.", "That's why you clean the sheets. But if someone is OK with someone sleeping and sweating in their bed, it doesn't make any sense that sex isn't OK.", "I was responding to the comments about how Catholic Irish people are, and about Irish people not being open about sex. \n\nI'm not sure what kind of Ireland you live in, but no one I know is religious. Most people want to send their kids to Educate Together schools, but if it's easier send them to a Catholic one, many will, but not because they're religious.\n\nIf you are actually Irish, why are you feeding the paddywhackery with the Top O The Morning shite?", "There are dozens of us. *Dozens!*", "He was clearly a Never Nude. I wonder if he attends the annual conferences?", "Never Nude! Anyone get that reference?", "I had an ex that did that, which was unfortunate since he went to the gym everyday and had an amazing body.", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJF2VT-ymjM", "He was a Never Nude!", "Let me guess... white guy?", "Agreed. Not even sure why they brought the US up when they didn't even know where I was from. No wonder people from other countries on Reddit are annoyed with Americans. We're always making shit about us.", "See, here's the thing, he was being nice by letting her stay there while house sitting. You don't have people over while house sitting without permission first. \n\nI knew that as a 16 year old doing it. I had a boyfriend at the time and god damn sure I wanted to tell him to drive over and fuck cuz I still lived with my PARENTS and not even in a dorm, where you CAN fuck if your roommate is out or if you have a single.\n\nIt is not unreasonable for OP to think his sister knows that you don't have sex in someone else's bed or invite company over to someone else's house without their express permission. If OP's sister wanted to hang out with boyfriend, she should've asked or gone back to her dorm, her space, or her BF's space and fucked, not her LITERAL BROTHER,S BED! \n\nSide note.. who wants to fuck someone where they know their sibling has slept and probably also had sex? Not me! I'd never fuck someone in my sister's bed and if she fucked someone in my bed I'd probably burn my mattress.", "I would not care if someone else had sex in my bed, as long as they changed the sheets. It's a bed. They can have sex anywhere in my house that's cleanable. It wouldn't bother me any more than them pooing in my toilet would.", "Haha, he's probably not even \"from\" Ireland, he's probably a red-headed American of Irish descent who is trying to reinvent himself for college.", "I found this comment so funny lol. I just find the accents sexy lol not cause their smarter!", "American woman here. Not all European accents lol \u2026\u2026", "He has a very particular set of skills.", ">clowshoes\n\nThink they meant clownshoes.\n\nhttps://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=clownshoes", "That's great, love that for you.", "Never-nude!! This show was fucking crazy! \n#ArrestedDevelopment", "Are you looking for... A new start?", "I posted my comment at the same time lmao", "TBH I get the vibe that anyone voting anything other than a solid NTA either has no siblings, or has a fucked up relationship with them. Quite the assumption to make but I literally can\u2019t imagine boinking in either of my siblings\u2019 beds", "I had a rommate who would do that.  She would put on this fake Irish accent whenever she wanted attention.  I met her parents and neither of them spoke with an Irish accent.", "\u2026 what? Thats a somewhat insane conjecture. Maybe Im missing a reference?", "they're*", "This is false. Young men and women both are inherently dumb. People are unbelievably dumb in general.", "Young people are inherently dumb.   It has nothing to do with sex or gender.  It's got to do with being young.", "Young = inexperienced = stupid \n\nYes, yes they are, because they are people that are young", "You should keep reading before responding.", "Your profile says you are based in NY. When did you leave Ireland? You seem to have a very old fashioned view of what it's like, which makes me think you haven't lived here or even visited for several decades at least", "You might be right. I'm an only child so just asked my partner their thoughts of whether they'd have sex in their sister's bed. They said it was gross and they'd never sleep in their sister's bed full stop let alone shag in it, they'd camp out in the living room.", "I\u2019m an only child, and this is *still* a solid NTA. This is an issue of consent and boundaries.", "No they would not have that right and it would be weird and invasive AF. If OP knew his sister had a BF, he should have known she wasn't going to not have him over for 2 WEEKS. Gods, get a mattress cover, you should have 1 anyway. Things can be washed, grow up.", "I wouldn't in the owner's bed. Guest bed, sure, or just go down to the dock or out in the boat like civilized people.", "I don't know about now, but in the early 2000s, there was a fad of people pretending they had an English or Irish accent to seem more interesting. They're definitely making some logical leaps without knowing anything else about the Irish guy though.", "Nah, just a common thing for Americans to claim they\u2019re Irish, when the likelihood is they\u2019re probably more likely to be related to Germanic or Nordic, rarely Celtish.", "She said she doesn't like smart people", "Thank you, good comment\u263a\ufe0f", "I'm 27. I'm incredibly dumb.", "Agreed. I am going to be 30 in a couple of months and I have just barely started feeling like a functioning adult who doesn\u2019t make the stupidest possible decisions. I firmly believe that 20s are just an extended teenager phase, especially 20-25. I don\u2019t think I started actually getting my shit together until like 27.", "The day you stop learning and stop making mistakes is usually accompanied by a dirge and a coffin", "Young does not always mean inexperienced. Some people live through more diverse experiences in 30 years than others who live 80 years. This whole measuring how smart someone is by their age is assumptive and often incorrect.", "on the coffin ships, t'was so long ago, i forgot people like you were there, ready to start on the slightest whiff of excitement.", "Yes, it would be reasonable, because the owners of the house have the right to say they don\u2019t want other people having sex in their house. And if whatever couple doesn\u2019t like that, they just don\u2019t need to stay in that fucking house. It\u2019s that simple. If you can\u2019t respect peoples space and rules, you simply no longer are allowed to stay in their space.", "your lack of manners on other people's property is frankly astounding. you are a mighty arrogant person to believe you can just do whatever you want in peoples home. funny how one would think consent would be important, and yet you victim blame OP for feeling uncomfortable that someone used their property in ways they didn't consent to, saying \"they should have known better\" because i guess having a spouse mean their going to fuck on their bed when you ask them to stay over to feed their cat?", "You made me laugh. Some how fucking on the dock is civilized.", "Man, thats so embarrassing lol", "Just wait until you're in you 30's. You'll think you were horrifically dumb. I'm 40 and think that about my 30's. I wonder if it ever goes away\ud83d\ude02", "same", "I'm 35 and a total fucking moron.", "28 checking in, 27 was the turning point for me.", "I don\u2019t know what it was but everything shifted for me (in a good way) when I turned 30. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still don\u2019t know what I want to be when I grow up but I really stopped caring about what people thought of me and started to understand myself and who I was and shit like that. Quite refreshing really.", "Many people do make at least one last mistake on the same day they end up in a coffin, but otherwise, yes good point.", "\"He who isn't busy being born is busy dying\"---Robert Zimmerman,  bka Bob Dylan", "You seem oddly controlling and prudish over other people's behavior. There is literally no reason to get mad unless you are shaming someone for having sex. They aren't leaving fluids everywhere bc they are washing the sheets, so do I. \n\nDon't misuse \"victim blaming\" and the concept of consent. OP wasn't sexually assaulted. \n\nI don't like other people pooping in my toilet but I'm going to assume someone staying at my place, especially for 2 weeks, is going to do that in my home. They could probably go elsewhere but I would be ridiculous and insane for asking them to do so.", "You were supposed to get a chuckle out of it.\n\nOP should have expected it was going to happen while he was gone, but his sister shouldn't have said anything about it. It's a normal thing to wash the sheets so they're clean when he returns."]}
