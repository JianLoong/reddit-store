It may have felt worse than it was, as you were already in a nightmarish headspace.\n\nAbout grabbing the hood of your boyfriend's shirt - I agree that was a bit much, but it happens, as it is impossible to do much without invading other people's space on planes.

If it looks like the parents are doing their best then other passengers normally don\u2019t mind.", "They were trash talking the people behind them in such a way that it was obvious they wanted to be heard.", "Why are you responding to every single comment?", "I would like to see how you react on trash-talking that you took little baby to airplane. OP should be quiet and do not escalate situation", "Yeah, and the fact that babies are babies and not adults with a finished brain has nothing to do with that I guess /s", "They were trash talking the people behind them in such a way that it was obvious they wanted to be heard.", "As someone with a kid, if I had to be subjected to their horrible parenting in front of me I\u2019d comment too. You can take your kid on a flight and be a responsible parent and passenger, a kid doesn\u2019t give you a free pass to disrupt others flight.", "OP and her boyfriend weren't assholes.\nThe parents have a responsibility to deal with their brat.", "I\u2019m going to go ahead and say that op is probably not a reliable narrator and she doesn\u2019t state how long the baby was not changed for but I highly doubt the parents let their child sit in shit for an extended period of time just to spite her", "They might have not known.", "No they made those comments about what was happening, the line right before the one you quote says\n\n> As we got on the plane right behind us was a family with a crying baby.\n\nSo the kid was crying from the beginning that\u2019s why\n\n> The baby kept being raised in the air and was grabbing the hood of my boyfriends shirt \n\nTo calm them down", "Perfectly sensible comment.", "Exactly! I don\u2019t like being touched. Especially by strangers. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a baby or an adult! I\u2019m not comfortable around babies either and I don\u2019t find them cute or start gushing every time I see one. And I bet you anything if OP and her bf had said something directly to the mom\u2026she wouldn\u2019t have cared anyway because it\u2019s \u201cjust a baby\u201d and everyone has to put up with it.", "Does it really need to be directly communicated that you don't want a complete stranger grabbing you or your belongings? Baby or not.  \n\n\nRespecting personal space seems like common courtesy as well.", "They were making a reasonable point.  Glad they were heard.  Perhaps entitled parents will finally get the message, but I doubt it.", "I'm not saying babies and adults are the same, I am saying that other people doing things that annoy you is part of living in a society. You don't want annoying people - then go live where there are no people.", "So? If the people behind them can't stand being around annoying people, maybe they're the ones that shouldn't travel (just to apply your logic here).", "They were making the comments BEFORE the hoodie grabbing and pooping took place.", "I think they were. They deliberately made comments they knew would upset the parents. They'd decided to take against them whatever had happened - this was a self-fulfilling prophecy. They went onto that plane already dead set on hating on parents flying with their babies - then antagonised the parents.", "Well said.", "Good point. I'd like to know exactly when the seatbelt signs went on relative to when the baby needed changing.", "Yes. Also, according to OP\u2019s version of events, they didn\u2019t complain about a soiled baby smelling like poop for hours during the flight. I could have *maybe* got behind that. \n\nThey actually complained, audibly, about baby crying. That\u2019s dickish. YTA", "Seriously?  That's your view.  Sigh.", "Then they\u2019re not fit to be parents wtf", "I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I find it hard to believe.  They are in close proximity with their baby (probably on someone's lap) and most parents know when their baby is doing their business - they know how their baby reacts to the action of pooping or peeing before it even happens - \"Thats his/her pooping face!\". Sure, its possible they didn't notice when it happened.  But to not notice the smell afterwards? \ud83e\udd14", "No.", "Then comparing babies, who cannot help crying, with adults gossiping about people while said people can hear it is in NO way a fair comparison. I might find people annoying, but that doesn't mean I feel entitled to be able to say hurtful stuff. It is just not comparable.", "No. These parents are definitely the assholes", "I think OP is correct that if you have a very small baby you should maybe just not go on long flights for the first few years. It\u2018s stressfull for the baby, especially if something happens with pressure in their ears, and extremely annoying to everyone around you. Imo it\u2018s \u201edickish\u201c and selfish to do unless it\u2018s absolutely necessary", "This.  People are reaching to try to make excuses for the 'parents'.  But to say they deserve the benefit of the doubt as to whether their baby shat itself is batshit crazy.", "You're entitled to you view.  As am I to mine.  OP was completely fine to say what she did.", "Having a screaming, kicking child that smells like poop, and probably bothers the entire plane, and then having the balls to complain about people saying things that you don't like - that's the definition of living in a glass house and throwing stones. To me, THAT'S entitlement.\n\nAnd I'm obviously not comparing OP to a baby, but to the parents, who are of course responsible for the situation.", "> As am I to mine. OP was completely fine to say what she did.\n\nNo."]}
