Soon after, my mom told everyone how it was all because of my dad and made up some pretty disgusting lies that painted my dad in a bad light. They range from he\u2019s always out of town, to he didn\u2019t want a family, to he almost burned the house down. She always talked poorly about him, his mother (my grandma), his dad (my grandpa), and even me sometimes (a quote from her \u201cyou smell like your father, go take a shower\u201d or telling a friend my clothing and my style is based on \u201cher fucking bastard dad\u201d because I prefer pants to dresses and skirts, which is on top of her verbal abuse). She also would insult how my dad was changing in a way to make him happy that she hated (she called it \u201chippie shit\u201d). It was a toxic environment, she\u2019s a toxic person, and I moved out when I turned 18 and live with my dad now. I was very low contact until she started turning up at our house every weekend. \nMy dad has never spoken a bad word about her. He\u2019s always polite, respectful, and the most kind person I know. \nMy mom had to have a double surgery and needed full time care as well as someone to take her to and from appointments in August 2020.

He drove her to the appointments, I cared for her, etc. Now he has a \u201cnormal\u201d 9-5 job instead of being self-employed like before and that was one of her negative views on him and she also saw that as him changing for her (and not because of the economy). \nMy stepmom passed in August 2022 of stage 4 brain cancer and I think that\u2019s when my mom starting trying to date my dad again.\nThey told me last night they were seeing each other again. I kept quiet and eventually just went to bed. She ended up staying the night and after she leaves, I want to tell my dad how big of mistake this is. She\u2019s already pressuring him to get married, because \u201cI want to be married again before I turn 60\u201d (her words) while he never wants to get married again (nor did he want to get married in the first place). She\u2019s an alcoholic, she\u2019s just a negative person to be around, she wants him to move once the lease on the house he\u2019s renting is up because she doesn\u2019t like the neighborhood, she wants him to change his appearance (both shave his beard and cut his hair), and things like that. I can see her returning to her toxic ways that she has when she\u2019s in a relationship (she yelled at my dad for burning the potatoes and \u201calmost burning the house down\u201d after she burned them, taking a shower while my dad was out mowing the lawn) and trying to control every aspect again.

I would be honest with him. He should  know that this may cause you to distance your self from him.", "NTA - You\u2019re fighting for your dad\u2019s mental and emotional health. And that will never make you an asshole.", "NTA-I'd be tempted to run her out of the house. Speak to your Dad, remind him why they split. Tell him everything she said to you, all of the abuse, and the way she used your Dad as a negative comparison when insulting you. He's lost because he just lost his partner. He's very vulnerable to your mother's trickery right now.", "Oh dear god, definitely NTA. If anything, I'd be going a bit  harder to keep your dad away.", "NTA you are trying to save you father from the pain and hurt marriage to your mom would bring. Your mother caused you trauma, you need to explain that to your father. Be honest, tell him why you went NC with your mother, and why you would would like to continue to be NC with her. Your mom has not changed.", "Nta. Lay it on thick.", "NTA Tell him everything you posted OP. Tell him you love him and if he still wants to be with her after knowing how toxic she is that you won\u2019t stop them. That\u2019s all you can do, say your peace and hope for the best. Your mom is a real AH for pouncing in a vulnerable grieving man after losing his spouse. If he does re- marry \u201cmommy dearest\u201d encourage him to have a pre-nip in place. Best of luck to you.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your dad is really lonely. Tell him what a terrible idea it is for him to get involved with your mother again, then suggest ways for him to meet other women.", "Info: You portray your mother negatively without providing insight on your parents original marriage and your fathers behavior. Did your father so any of the things she said when they divorced? Did he work out of town leaving her as the only parent? Did he almost burn the house down? Did he not want a family?", "NTA. That comment about burning the potatoes reminds me so much of a narcissist I know who screamed at her husband for letting the pot boil over (she was the one in the kitchen cooking but no one had told her the pot she wasn\u2019t paying attention to was violently bubbling away).\n\nYou should sit your dad down and tell him all the abusive comments she\u2019s made to you over the years. It wasn\u2019t just an attack on your dad, it was an attack on you too since half of you came from him.", "NTA\n\nWrite him a pro/con list", "My dad waiting on my mom hand and foot. He let her do anything she wanted. He did leave for work constantly (until I was 7, he didn\u2019t work more than one stat away so he could be home on weekends and help my mom) but she also would kick him out and try to pick a fight with him when he was home. He was more of a parent my 21 years of life than she ever was. She tried to kill me 3 times, she has been drunk for 50% of my life, and refused to go to any life event or support me while in college. My dad has been to every life event. My mom thought by throwing items (mainly clothes she liked and food) at me, I would prefer her over my dad. Hell, I saw less of my dad than my mom the first 18 years, and I still told the judge I wanted to live with my dad because he treated me like a human being and not a burden.", "NTA\n\nLook after your dad. He is still grieving and she is taking advantage of this fact.  I would tell him not only to NOT get involved with her again but that you would not be living with him anymore if he does.  You do not need to be back in that toxic environment either.", "NTA ,you have every right to speak your truth. I just hope that if your dad doesn't listen to you, and your mom moves back in, that you're able to find someplace else to live, because she's clearly a horrible and toxic person, and you shouldn't live through that again. Maybe another family member, or a friend?", "Yep. NTA, but ultimately his choice."]}
