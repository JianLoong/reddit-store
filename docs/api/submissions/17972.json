So, I moved here. NOW I would just like to pre-face that I am learning the language, maybe not as dedicated as I should be BUT it's coming on slowly. Adding that everyone here speaks nearly perfect english (my native lang) hasn't forced anything really. \n\nEveryone except his mother, she speaks very poor english and we have not really communicated much with each other, outside of translations. So at family functions I just kinda sit there waiting for someone to talk to me, I'm not really included in conversations or plan making. Sometimes they be talking and talking and they will stop to ask me a question about the convo they are having, I give an answer then they carry on in their own language. \n\nNow I kinda get why they speak around mom that way, she's more important and excluding her would be like A-level douche. Except, when we go out with his brother and his gf they all talk without including me and they all speak english perfect. In other situations going out with friends and co-workers they understand and usually make a point to speak english around non-speakers so they feel included. But my husband doesn't do that with his bro and his girl. Slighty hurts my feelings, especially when they make a point to invite me so i 'feel included' then just exclude the fuck outta me. \n\nI started learning the language, trying harder to speak with them. But the last two times, his mom would not slow down for me even after asking and his brother just laughs at my attempts, grammar, pronunciation- not very encouraging. \n\nSo, I will confess at this point a few years later it's exhausting and lonely in those moments, especially when I consider how close I am with family, how welcoming they are, and how excluded I feel here. Last time we visit, I basically just sat on my phone and maybe had one to many drinks because i was feeling salty and sad. Apparently this was a problem because it looked like I didn't care. I told him time and time how it was and he idk he just doesn't see the problem and insists they include me. \n\nWe got in a huge fight and I basically said I don't wanna go to family functions anymore, which he said cannot happen because I will be expected. \n\nSo AITA here? \n\nThis is a throw away account because he knows my main lol", "created_utc": 1684838895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pkxpx/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_around_his_family_when/", "score": 595, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You mentioned few years, so I'm assuming at least 3. If you haven't been able to converse even after that, then you need to look at how you are learning the language. At some point you need to ask yourself if you can ever learn this language and then have a chat about your future in the country with your husband.", "YTA\n\nI am an American living in Denmark.  If you have been there two years and have not picked up the basics.  Your attempt to pick up the language is minimal at best.  Taking a course and going to a language cafe is a good start but you need practice that is without your husband or his family.\n\n1. Join some kind of club where you will be forced to pick up the language or attend church.  (I started playing Dungeons and Dragons. Kind of geeky but it really helped).\n2. Find the part of the language that you find difficult and practice.  Danish is easy to read and write but pronunciation is really hard.  I practice speaking every chance I get and I watch movies or TV shows in Danish with Danish subtitles.  So I can see and understand what I am hearing.\n3. Everyone speaks prefect English to pretty good English here and in most Scandanavian countries, but there are times when I have to speak Danish. I will admit the first four to five months I was pretty lazy because it was easy to speak English.  The times I needed to learn Danish were few and far between.  This is why I think you are an AH.  It was too easy not to learn and now you expect everyone to cater to you.\n\nForce yourself to learn the language and do not give up just because it is hard. If you realize your pronunciation is not the best, then just roll with it.  If they make fun, turn the tables on them and say okay... teach me how to say it properly.  After 10 to 20 times to get you to say it properly, I guarantee you, you will be getting some practice, they will see you are trying.  The comments will stop.\n\nSome of what his family are doing is going into the AH territory. But I think they have the right to expect better progress from you.  Danes, just like Americans, expect people to learn the language if someone is choosing to live in their country.", "As a Swede, ESH. \n\nYes, you can get away with not speaking Swedish if you live in one of the larger cities and your social circle skews young. Especially if you work in an academic field. I speak very little Swedish at work due to having a lot of immigrant colleagues and most of the technical language I need not existing in Swedish anyway so why force that awkwardness on everyone at a meeting. I'm also happy to speak English in social settings where everyone is comfortable with it. \n\nIn social situations where not everyone is comfortable, however, the default is to speak the majority language (in this case whatever Scandinavian language is relevant) so that as many people as possible can understand. I've been on the receiving end of this when dating a guy from a country where I didn't know the language and English isn't the default second language for Gen X or older (we still lived in Sweden, though) and it sucks, but it is what it is. His family was kind enough to whisper-translate to me (whoever was closest and comfortable with English) and I managed to pick up a little of the language over our few visits and some studying at home. \n\nYou suck because you haven't (by your own admission) put in as much of an effort as you should have and are asking his family members to be uncomfortable in their own homes, he sucks for not translating and his family sucks for laughing at your attempts. It shouldn't be a problem to occasionally repeat yourself if someone doesn't catch what you say (I sometimes have to because of my dialect even when speaking to native speakers, it's not a problem), and laughing at someone's pronunciation or grammar is just rude. If an accidental pun happens due to such errors, my policy is to explain and then laugh together or not at all.", "They\u2019re probably mad with you for not trying harder to communicate with them, so they don\u2019t try harder to communicate with you. You\u2019re probably mad at them because you feel like they don\u2019t include you because of the language barrier. \n\nI think your husband can be the mediator and translator here, as I assume he speaks well in both languages and clear the air. This may make you all feel more comfortable and understood, including your husband as it means he won\u2019t have to choose between spending time with his family and you.\n\nThen if the behaviour/feelings continue, it\u2019s probably not a language thing and it might be because ESH.", "YTA. You are living in whichever Scandinavian country your husband comes from, and you're complaining about people in that country talking in their native tongue.

You don't care. You're not trying. The person excluding you is you, by your refusal to put any reasonable amount of effort in to learning the language.\n\nYou say that the fact that most people speak good English \"hasn't forced anything\".

Sounds like they made accommodation for you in the beginning and when they felt you weren\u2019t that bothered they gave up.\nIf you aren\u2019t happy and are finding it too difficult/socially awkward to embrace a new language then it\u2019s probably time to cut your losses and go home.

I don\u2019t blame you for being less engaged in a conversation you cannot follow, especially if they\u2019re not giving you some grace during the learning period and even mocking you for your attempts. \n\nThat said you should definitely listen to the people that are calling you an AH and advising you to step up your efforts to learn.

His brother making fun of your grammar and pronunciation is uncalled for. That his mother wouldn't slowdown, a normal request from someone learning, indicates she isn't interested in doing so. That's, of course, her prerogative, but if it's a smaller gathering it's definitely exclusive. You've also seen them treat other English speakers differently, which is adding to the feelings of exclusion.\n\nKeep learning, maybe step it up a bit, but, yeah, I wouldn't want to go if you're going to get mocked for attempting to speak the language anyway, either. No point in going before you're more proficient if that's the attitude, anyway", "INFO: do you practice with your husband?

A couple more, too, like \"I'm sorry; I'm having trouble understanding,\" etc.\n\nAs for the brother and his wife, if it's just the four of you, I would interrupt every single thing they say with, \"Could we please speak English? [Said in English] I'm working very hard on my XYZish, but I can't keep up.\" Literally keep saying it every single time they say a word in the other language, as if they must just be sweet, dumb idiots who forgot you don't speak XYZish fluently yet.\n\nAnd yeah, of course, double down on your lessons. I feel like I have to say that to head off the comments I'll get otherwise. But the point is that these people (besides mom) DO speak your language, and they know that you're trying to learn theirs. I'm an American, and when I speak to someone here with limited English, I do everything I can to accommodate them, because I'm not a fucking asshole.\n\nOh!

You learn the language of where you're living.  You learn the culture.  You learn the laws.  You absorb yourself into the land in which you live.  You're allowed to keep some of your culture and language with you, that's perfectly respectable.

Dunno where you are from but at least here the free school for learning the language is pretty bad. Additionally there is not much media to consume because almost no one speaks the language, so you are stuck watching kids movies or listening to boring news. And it took me a loong time to even be able to access the free Swedish classes. The Swedes can be super distant - I noticed really quick that at bars a group is either 90% Swedes or 90% immigrants (of different nationalities and speaking different tongues). Integration is NOT easy, your partner needs to wholly support you if he wants you to make it. But it becomes frustrating for them to have to slow down, and to repeat words for you. I have only met one Swedish person who will unwaveringly attempt to speak Swedish with me and teach me, and it is thanks to him I have improved so much.", "YTA while I don\u2019t think they have been the most welcoming to you, this really was on you to learn the language the moment you decided to move there (personally I would have been starting to learn it when you got serious dating).

Classes are a good foundation, but from my experience, I found the fastest way to learn a language is to put yourself in a brand new situation, away from any family/friends who might jump in and start translating or helping you, or discouraging you. \n\nJoin a new activity. Maybe a hiking club, or something you enjoy. You'll meet new people. Introduce yourself using ONLY their language. Do not use any English. Emphasize how you want to improve your language skills.

The vocabulary of the shared activity will easily translate into the new language for you, and you will have conversations on topics that are outside of the usual \"where are you from, what do you do?\" \n\nThat's how I ended up learning French. I went to France and volunteered in a local library, and I worked weekends (hung out) in a boulangerie. I absolutely love books and bread. These are things I can talk about endlessly in English, and figuring out how to speak on these things in a new language was my gateway in. Had I just sat down with a bunch of conjugations, I would have been bored and unmotivated. \n\nAnother good way to practice is to watch your favorite movie with the new language's subtitles. Watch it in English with the foreign subtitles, so you can read the words. Then watch again with the foreign dubbing, along with the foreign subtitles. When your confidence and abilities have increased, watch again with only the dubbing and no subtitles. \n\nIf you cook, another fast way to absorb the language is reading recipes. Recipes always have similar language patterns. There are the common verbs for mixing, frying, baking, folding, etc.and the common forms of measurement.  In a recipe, it's easy to see and understand a foreign language's mechanics and how it relates to English. You'll be translating very quickly. Take a recipe you know well. Maybe something like chocolate chip cookies. You basically already know what the recipe is saying. Looking at it in a foreign language, your brain instantly translates it and you will naturally pick up the new language's vocabulary and patterns. \n\nYou got this! Learning a new language when the people around you are discouraging is hell. But learning a new language on your own terms can be so exciting and fun. \n\nBest of luck to you. And tell your husband he's a jerk for letting his brother ridicule you. Next time he pronounces an English word in his Scandi accent, tell him it ain't sexy, it's stupid. See how he feels. (Just kidding. Don't do that. But you can tell him to encourage his family to support your language efforts and show some patience).", "Info: How many more years do you think it will be before you're able to speak conversationally with these folks in their language?

I work (more than) full-time in English, speak English at home, and by default consume English media in my spare time, and that just wasn't working, even taking a German course. Things accelerated dramatically when I took more lessons per week (and varied-- DuoLingo and Lingoda and \"Learn German with Anja\" all at once), picked German-language TV shows to watch (something like [this plugin](https://appforlanguage.com) can help immensely), listen to German music, set aside an hour a week with German-speaking coworkers to have a German meeting once a week, changed my phone to German language, and stopped asking anyone to switch to English. You really have to force yourself to use and absorb the language or it won't stick. It will be uncomfortable, give you literal headaches, and make you tired. But you'll get it.

They say it takes 500-600 hours of study to reach B2, but that highly varies depending on how much you force yourself to immerse. No one's an AH here yet.\n\nI'd suggest going to these family functions, and prepare a simple story or anecdote in the language on something topical, as well as some typical vocabulary on the topic. Get as far as you can. Then even if you don't say anything the rest of the gathering, they'll see you're trying. Then I'd suggest sitting with Google Translate open on your phone and try to listen to all the vocabulary around you you can. Look up words as you hear them. Listen. Don't bury yourself in English language phone content when you have a great opportunity to hear the language better amongst native speakers!

And my family has been so supportive. They talk English to them, but my mom's English isn't the best so she throws in different words as well. Which is actually been a great help for my partner to learn. My family makes sure my partner understands what's being said, and explains certain words and phrases to them that aren't common in English. My grandma doesn't speak English but still tries to talk to my partner by talking slowly so they can understand and otherwise have other people translate. \n\nMy partner, meanwhile, has been picking up so much in a short time because of this. It's amazing to see that both sides are learning a lot. It's nice. \n\nSo I don't know how much effort you are putting into learning the language, but if you really are trying, it's sad to see how your in-laws are acting. I don't think it's unreasonable to, at the bare minimum, not be laughed at when trying to learn the language. If your in-laws aren't willing to slow down, that's fine, that happens to me sometimes as well. Parents and people who speak English less well get talking and they don't have to slow down for one person.

His family make effort to talk to me in English what they can, I reply in french as much as I can. And my partner mostly translates in-between. But there's lots of situations in which he can't really be expected to translate every little thing, or is otherwise engaged in conversation and again he doesn't need to stop to translate everything for me, and as much as I try and can understand a fair bit I dont have the vocabulary to respond. But we've been together 5 years. The first year I actually lived in France in an English speaking job and I've had every opportunity since then to improve my french but it's my fault I haven't much, I've tried, but not as hard as I could have. It's not easy! But if I can't follow every conversation and get left out, that's my problem, I don't expect everyone to slow down for me, or speak English for me. Your actually LIVING in this country? Honestly I think you need to make a bit more effort to learn and just accept the fact you won't always be able to follow all conversations. My partner's lived in England for a while now, his English is very good, but he still struggles in big groups. But it's just not possible for everyone to slow down or speak one by one so he can understand.

Scandinavian languages are easier than English in everyday use. They have 3-4 specialities you need to learn but they have almost no exceptions", "When everyone shits on your efforts, it's kinda hard to stay motivated.", "Almost every single Scandanavian speaks English beautifully - as English is the lingua franca of business and politics. Sweden used to have 8 million people - more people live in NYC.\n\nMy mother's family is still in Sweden. The family is purposely rude.", "I get taught japanese as part of my course, 3 hrs a week plus self teaching \n\nit\u2019s not standard small talk it\u2019s genuine conversations and regardless of that, OP has been immersed in the culture for 3 years and she\u2019s still struggling like she\u2019s a beginner she has put in bare minimum effort into learning", "Hey, I would never make fun of norwegians! Those guys have it rough enough as is.\nAnd my mom told me to never punch downwards.", "Totally agree \n\nI think there's a lot of people here who haven't learned a language as an adult and are assuming the old adage that it \"takes 6 months\". But that's no longer true as immersion doesn't exist anymore, unless you're in a very small town. \n\nIf you live in a major city, chances are most people speak English and will switch instantly upon hearing your atrocious accent. \n\nI do think that, if you intend to stay, you really do need to put in more effort, though. You will always be isolated until you're reasonably fluent and that is a hard life. I don't think it's right for the family to treat OP badly, though, since she did move for this guy to a country where she has no social network. They need to be kind and accommodate it, or he needs to stick up for her or translate for her.\n\nSource: I've lived in Warsaw, Poland for nearly 2 years and i can say like 4 phrases in Polish. I'm not actively trying to learn Polish because it's a temporary stay for me. I work in English, my friends know English, most signs/announcements/labels/etc. have English in addition to Polish. So I'm not forced to learn anything. Likely the same for OP.\n\nNAH\n\nETA reorganizing for clarity", "She certainly had some time before she started everyday life there.", "Because you're being a burden due to your lack of effort.  You're trying ***now*** but you've had 3 years with full immersion.  \n\nOf course it's rude for you to have barely tried then say that's why you won't come over.  \n\nYou're expected to be there because you chose this life while not actually putting in the effort for it.\n\nNo one is expecting you to be fluent.  People are expecting you to have made ***some*** progress in 3 years and to actually try to be involved at events.", "I was literally just in Norway visiting a cousin and his family. I have never learnt a lick of Norwegian in my life up to this point. We're born and bred Lithuanians, so obviously spoke that language in the house with him, his wife and 2 children. Minimal exposure to Norwegian outside of other kids coming over to play and reading random signs.\n\nWe went to the cinema to watch the Mario movie a week in. Dubbed and subbed in Norwegian, and honestly I understood 90% of what was said from just a week of asking questions about what words on signs mean. It's obviously a children's movie and context, tropes + subtitles helped a lot, but it took me only a week of being vaguely curious. Scandi Norse languages aren't utter enigmas for English speakers.\n\nUnless the country you are in is Finland, you have no excuse to not be near fluent in a Scandinavian language after 3 years of living there when your mother tongue is English. And even if it was Finish, Jesus Christ on a motorbike, you're not at even a beginner level 3 years later?", "But Scandinavian languages aren't difficult at all. Most migrants learn them within the year. They're much easier than English.", "Scandinavian languages are some of the *easiest* languages for English speakers to learn, similar or easier than learning Romance languages. (See for instance [here](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/easiest-languages-for-english-speakers-to-learn).) [The US Foreign Service Institute places Norwegian, Swedish and Danish in \u201cCategory I\u201d](https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/), meaning the languages that require the least training for an English speaker to gain fluency.", "My kids were conversationally fluent in less than a year. Three years in and I wasn't at B1 yet. I think \"fed up\" it going too far-- not everyone learns at the same rate. OP could definitely have made better use of the time, but should consider all those people willing to speak the language with them an opportunity, not an offense. People too quick to switch to English is a sure way to never learn.", "Completely understandable that your progress would be slowed if your husband\u2019s family and friends are actually laughing at you. It\u2019s hard enough learning another language without someone putting you down for it\n\nNTA", "If someone says r\u00f6ven instead of r\u00e4ven you\u2019d need to be superhuman not to laugh.", "The children's TV is the perfect recommendation and find it helps immensely. They speak slower, overpronounce,  repeat words and use aids to get their point across.", "I can say from personal experience that Swedes are kind of assholes when it come to English speakers learning Swedish. Because the level of English is so high amongst the general population, they are unaccustomed to hearing an \u201cEnglish\u201d accent when someone speaks Swedish. They laugh, tell you how funny you sound, then want you to say it again so they can giggle some more. The amount of correcting grammar and pronunciation is disheartening. If I mix up en/ett you still know what I am talking about. So no, it is not necessary to correct me every time I get an article wrong. \n\nGranted, not all Swedes are like this, but enough are that it is a huge deterrent to wanting to speak the language. You have my full sympathy. I can guarantee that if you corrected your BIL\u2019s English pronunciation every sentence the same way he does to you that he would be really pissed off. I have no advice, just know you aren\u2019t alone.", "I feel your pain op, i am also in a relationship with someone who's native language is not English which mine is, but you really need to put in more effort. Make him talk to you in his language at home. You'll never get better without practice. I've been learning for just over a year and i can at least manage basic conversations. His family probably feel it's disrespectful of you not to try harder to adapt and instead make them adjust for you. Three years is too long.\n\nEdit for spelling because my autocorrect is in the language I'm learning lol", "OP says the last 2 times. Which means years of not being shit on.", "That's why you do it for yourself and not them. Too many people today are so dependent on having people praise or reward them to have any motivation. Just go do it and the situation would probably resolve itself.\n\nSo much is within our own control if we don't simply crumble at the sign of any adversity.", "Just because the family speak english doesn't mean they are rude. I would feel so embarassed If everyone has to speak my languages instead of their mother language that are more confortable for them after YEARS on a foreign country.", "OP should still be making a better effort to learn the language instead of expecting everyone to just speak her language. It goes both ways. Op is living in a Scandinavian country therefore the onus is on OP to be the one making more effort to speak the language. Perhaps if she made more of an effort consistently instead of excluding herself and having a personal pity party in the corner every time they visit. I'll bet she if she actually really tried everytime people would be more helpful and laugh at her less.", "She also said she hasn't been as dedicated to learning the language as she could be.", "If it's a Scandinavian language, it's incredibly difficult. Especially for an adult.", "OP also said that even when they talk in English, they do not include her in their conversations. Even if OP is extremely morose and anti-social, basic courtesy suggests that people would turn to her to make a remark atleast sometimes in the conversation. What really surprises me is the husband's attitude here. He doesn't listens to her concerns and even said that she would have to go family functions even if she does not want to because its \"expected\". Sounds like his family doesn't even want her there or maybe they wanted their son to marry someone from their own country or culture. And they actually expect her to hang around them and continue being miserable. Nta, OP.\n\nUnless she is purposefully painting the family in a bad light this also does not seem to be a very ideal environment for language learning. And she did mention that her coworkers do accomodate her. Then why is the family excluding her? It doesn't seem to just be due to her not being able to speak the language yet.", "As a finnish person i\u2019d like to comment here that Finland isn\u2019t part of the Scandinavia. Nordic countries sure.\n\nLiving there for 3 years the OP really can\u2019t mean Finland while talking about Scandinavia", "I'd also suggest going full immersion at home with partner. Using English speakers as a crutch isn't helping her learn the language. Also, strangely, watching children's television programs can help.\n\nI don't know what the university course is like, but if they're anything like most high school and college courses and Rosetta Stone, she's learning very formal language that isn't the way speakers actually speak it.", "I am at B1 currently after 14 months, I am bad with languages, I'm lazy and don't study much, I work in an English speaking environment, and I have a chronic illness that creates memory issues. I also also in my mid 30s. Three years is too long in my opinion, to not even be able to have basic conversations. \n\nMy in-laws stopped speaking English for me after about 8 months and friends have tapered off by now too. It's hard, i understand that. And people wanting to speak English makes it hard to practice. But it comes across as entitled and imo displays a lack of commitment to not even be able to at least manage basic small talk after three years. She doesn't have to be B.1 or 2 but she needs to be able to talk a little", "But at least you actively tried! Doesn't sound like OP did, until now.", "I'm thinking about the American man who told a woman in Mexico that he was embarrassed--or he thought he did. Watch out for false cognates kids!", "Scandinavian languages are ranked among the easiest in the world for English speakers to learn.", "What?? Norwegian is one of the easiest languages to learn for an English speaker, Danish and Swedish are similar.\nUnless she's talking about Icelandic or Finnish in which case true.", "Absolutely. But if she practiced a measly 1h/week, that's 168 hours under her belt. That's like three classes in college, enough to be at least B1. OP has been immersed in the language for three years. If she can't have a conversation, hell, if she can't understand people speaking to her, there's a clear lack of effort on her part.", "Bullshit! That's literally total bullshit. As some who learned Swedish, I attended university courses in Swedish after 3 months of learning. I was allowed to write assignments in English but course language was Swedish.", "It is an important distinction, both geographically and culturally, and I totally agree with you that OP *should* know the difference.\n\nIt's just after 3 years of being incredibly rude to their host country and its citizens I have my doubts whether they *do*.", "> I am at B1 currently after 14 months, I am bad with languages\n\nIt sure doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re a bad with languages. To reach that in 14 months means about 7-8 hours of study per week for the average person going from English to German. That\u2019s dedication! With a family, high workload, and other obligations, I struggled to get 3 maybe 4 lessons a week in, and it indeed took me years to reach B1 German. \n\nAnd yeah, I also sometimes had judgemental people like you thinking I was taking too long, which really doesn\u2019t help.\n\nBut I think we agree having people insist on speak the language with you shouldn\u2019t be seen as excluding or insulting, but rather as an opportunity. You\u2019ll never get better practice than diving into that situation, and I was actually often frustrated by people being too quick to speak English to me when I was trying to use my German. (BTW, I\u2019m in Switzerland and it doesn\u2019t help that the spoken German here is dramatically different than written, and although they can speak high German, some find English equally comfortable if I can\u2019t speak dialect.)", "Not necessarily, living in Texas, I have worked with quite a few people who only spoke their native language after years here, it happens.  The guy training me at one place only spoke Vietnamese and had to have things translated for me to learn anything.   Not speaking English in the United States is nothing unusual from my experience.", "Fun fact: \"embarazado\" does mean embarrassed (as well as pregnant); it's just that virtually nobody uses it in that way.", "Finnish isn't Scandinavian for some stupid reason.", "Yeah, but that goes for people who know how to learn a new language. If I'm correct in what I've seen over the years, it's possible to go through an US education without having to seriously learn another language and if you then have to start that in your 30s, I can imagine it would be really difficult, especially if you don't need it in your day to day live.", "Exactly! I learned Swedish in 3 months and understood 80%! After 4 months, I held book presentations by Astrid Lindgren who write in old fashioned Swedish.\n\nAll the other student from all over Europe were similarly quick.", "Can guarantee learning Swedish (and probably any language for most people) goes much slower than this. Even immigrant doctors, who need to have 'Swedish fluency' to practice medicine and who use the language daily at work talk pretty bad a lot of the time.", "I'm American and don't know what a sundown state is, but there are free ESL (English as a second language) classses all over the country, in almost every town and county. Some are offered by the local schools, community centers and churches.  Some places do charge a small amount of money. And most public facilities and healthcare providers offer free translation if needed.", "What is a sundown state?", "It\u2019s for a very good reason. It\u2019s part of another language family and shares pretty much nothing with the Scandinavian language group.", "Yeah it's a Uralic language (like Hungarian), but Finland is an honorary Scandinavian country so it might be where OP lives.", "It was probably a typo for southern.", "Finns usually don\u2019t call themselves Scandinavian, she should at least have picked up that much in three years", "The Finnish are Nordic, not Scandinavian, same with Iceland. They are not \"honorary\" Scandinavian, they are part of the Nordic 5.", "Nope. A sundown state is typically a southern state, but one that is very racist, and will discriminate, segregate, threaten minorities and non-white folks. Sundown town is more often used I believe."]}
