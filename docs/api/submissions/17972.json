I worked in customer service so basic convo is not an issue. I can't understand complex convo. I'm solid in reading and writing, just suck at speaking and listening \n\n\nSo I (35F) married a Scandinavian (37M), we decided it was easier for me to move to him because he has kids from a previous relationship I have none. So, I moved here. NOW I would just like to preface that I am learning the language, maybe not as dedicated as I should be BUT it's coming on slowly. Adding that everyone here speaks nearly perfect english (my native lang) hasn't forced anything really. \n\nEveryone except his mother, she speaks very poor english and we have not really communicated much with each other, outside of translations. So at family functions I just kinda sit there waiting for someone to talk to me, I'm not really included in conversations or plan making. Sometimes they be talking and talking and they will stop to ask me a question about the convo they are having, I give an answer then they carry on in their own language. \n\nNow I kinda get why they speak around mom that way, she's more important and excluding her would be like A-level douche. Except, when we go out with his brother and his gf they all talk without including me and they all speak english perfect. In other situations going out with friends and co-workers they understand and usually make a point to speak english around non-speakers so they feel included. But my husband doesn't do that with his bro and his girl. Slighty hurts my feelings, especially when they make a point to invite me so i 'feel included' then just exclude the fuck outta me. \n\nI started learning the language, trying harder to speak with them. But the last two times, his mom would not slow down for me even after asking and his brother just laughs at my attempts, grammar, pronunciation- not very encouraging. \n\nSo, I will confess at this point a few years later it's exhausting and lonely in those moments, especially when I consider how close I am with family, how welcoming they are, and how excluded I feel here. Last time we visit, I basically just sat on my phone and maybe had one to many drinks because i was feeling salty and sad. Apparently this was a problem because it looked like I didn't care. I told him time and time how it was and he idk he just doesn't see the problem and insists they include me. \n\nWe got in a huge fight and I basically said I don't wanna go to family functions anymore, which he said cannot happen because I will be expected. \n\nSo AITA here? \n\nThis is a throw away account because he knows my main lol", "created_utc": 1684838895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pkxpx/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_around_his_family_when/", "score": 2022, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You mentioned few years, so I'm assuming at least 3. If you haven't been able to converse even after that, then you need to look at how you are learning the language. At some point you need to ask yourself if you can ever learn this language and then have a chat about your future in the country with your husband.", "YTA\n\nI am an American living in Denmark.  If you have been there two years and have not picked up the basics.  Your attempt to pick up the language is minimal at best.  Taking a course and going to a language cafe is a good start but you need practice that is without your husband or his family.\n\n1. Join some kind of club where you will be forced to pick up the language or attend church.  (I started playing Dungeons and Dragons. Kind of geeky but it really helped).\n2. Find the part of the language that you find difficult and practice.  Danish is easy to read and write but pronunciation is really hard.  I practice speaking every chance I get and I watch movies or TV shows in Danish with Danish subtitles.  So I can see and understand what I am hearing.\n3. Everyone speaks prefect English to pretty good English here and in most Scandanavian countries, but there are times when I have to speak Danish. I will admit the first four to five months I was pretty lazy because it was easy to speak English.  The times I needed to learn Danish were few and far between.  This is why I think you are an AH.  It was too easy not to learn and now you expect everyone to cater to you.\n\nForce yourself to learn the language and do not give up just because it is hard. If you realize your pronunciation is not the best, then just roll with it.  If they make fun, turn the tables on them and say okay... teach me how to say it properly.  After 10 to 20 times to get you to say it properly, I guarantee you, you will be getting some practice, they will see you are trying.  The comments will stop.\n\nSome of what his family are doing is going into the AH territory. But I think they have the right to expect better progress from you.  Danes, just like Americans, expect people to learn the language if someone is choosing to live in their country.", "As a Swede, ESH. \n\nYes, you can get away with not speaking Swedish if you live in one of the larger cities and your social circle skews young. Especially if you work in an academic field. I speak very little Swedish at work due to having a lot of immigrant colleagues and most of the technical language I need not existing in Swedish anyway so why force that awkwardness on everyone at a meeting. I'm also happy to speak English in social settings where everyone is comfortable with it. \n\nIn social situations where not everyone is comfortable, however, the default is to speak the majority language (in this case whatever Scandinavian language is relevant) so that as many people as possible can understand. I've been on the receiving end of this when dating a guy from a country where I didn't know the language and English isn't the default second language for Gen X or older (we still lived in Sweden, though) and it sucks, but it is what it is. His family was kind enough to whisper-translate to me (whoever was closest and comfortable with English) and I managed to pick up a little of the language over our few visits and some studying at home. \n\nYou suck because you haven't (by your own admission) put in as much of an effort as you should have and are asking his family members to be uncomfortable in their own homes, he sucks for not translating and his family sucks for laughing at your attempts. It shouldn't be a problem to occasionally repeat yourself if someone doesn't catch what you say (I sometimes have to because of my dialect even when speaking to native speakers, it's not a problem), and laughing at someone's pronunciation or grammar is just rude. If an accidental pun happens due to such errors, my policy is to explain and then laugh together or not at all.", "They\u2019re probably mad with you for not trying harder to communicate with them, so they don\u2019t try harder to communicate with you. You\u2019re probably mad at them because you feel like they don\u2019t include you because of the language barrier. \n\nI think your husband can be the mediator and translator here, as I assume he speaks well in both languages and clear the air. This may make you all feel more comfortable and understood, including your husband as it means he won\u2019t have to choose between spending time with his family and you.\n\nThen if the behaviour/feelings continue, it\u2019s probably not a language thing and it might be because ESH.", "YTA. You are living in whichever Scandinavian country your husband comes from, and you're complaining about people in that country talking in their native tongue.

You don't care. You're not trying. The person excluding you is you, by your refusal to put any reasonable amount of effort in to learning the language.\n\nYou say that the fact that most people speak good English \"hasn't forced anything\". What you mean is that you made the choice to be selfish, and rely on everyone else being able to speak your language, so you didn't have to bother with theirs.\n\nYour whole post reeks of entitlement.", "Moving to another country is hard especially when you dont know the language and the culture.

Sounds like they made accommodation for you in the beginning and when they felt you weren\u2019t that bothered they gave up.\nIf you aren\u2019t happy and are finding it too difficult/socially awkward to embrace a new language then it\u2019s probably time to cut your losses and go home.

I don\u2019t blame you for being less engaged in a conversation you cannot follow, especially if they\u2019re not giving you some grace during the learning period and even mocking you for your attempts. \n\nThat said you should definitely listen to the people that are calling you an AH and advising you to step up your efforts to learn.

His brother making fun of your grammar and pronunciation is uncalled for. That his mother wouldn't slowdown, a normal request from someone learning, indicates she isn't interested in doing so. That's, of course, her prerogative, but if it's a smaller gathering it's definitely exclusive. You've also seen them treat other English speakers differently, which is adding to the feelings of exclusion.\n\nKeep learning, maybe step it up a bit, but, yeah, I wouldn't want to go if you're going to get mocked for attempting to speak the language anyway, either. No point in going before you're more proficient if that's the attitude, anyway", "INFO: do you practice with your husband?

A couple more, too, like \"I'm sorry; I'm having trouble understanding,\" etc.\n\nAs for the brother and his wife, if it's just the four of you, I would interrupt every single thing they say with, \"Could we please speak English? [Said in English] I'm working very hard on my XYZish, but I can't keep up.\" Literally keep saying it every single time they say a word in the other language, as if they must just be sweet, dumb idiots who forgot you don't speak XYZish fluently yet.\n\nAnd yeah, of course, double down on your lessons. I feel like I have to say that to head off the comments I'll get otherwise. But the point is that these people (besides mom) DO speak your language, and they know that you're trying to learn theirs. I'm an American, and when I speak to someone here with limited English, I do everything I can to accommodate them, because I'm not a fucking asshole.\n\nOh!

You learn the language of where you're living.  You learn the culture.  You learn the laws.  You absorb yourself into the land in which you live.  You're allowed to keep some of your culture and language with you, that's perfectly respectable.

Dunno where you are from but at least here the free school for learning the language is pretty bad. Additionally there is not much media to consume because almost no one speaks the language, so you are stuck watching kids movies or listening to boring news. And it took me a loong time to even be able to access the free Swedish classes. The Swedes can be super distant - I noticed really quick that at bars a group is either 90% Swedes or 90% immigrants (of different nationalities and speaking different tongues). Integration is NOT easy, your partner needs to wholly support you if he wants you to make it. But it becomes frustrating for them to have to slow down, and to repeat words for you. I have only met one Swedish person who will unwaveringly attempt to speak Swedish with me and teach me, and it is thanks to him I have improved so much.", "YTA while I don\u2019t think they have been the most welcoming to you, this really was on you to learn the language the moment you decided to move there (personally I would have been starting to learn it when you got serious dating).

The vocabulary of the shared activity will easily translate into the new language for you, and you will have conversations on topics that are outside of the usual \"where are you from, what do you do?\" \n\nThat's how I ended up learning French. I went to France and volunteered in a local library, and I worked weekends (hung out) in a boulangerie. I absolutely love books and bread. These are things I can talk about endlessly in English, and figuring out how to speak on these things in a new language was my gateway in. Had I just sat down with a bunch of conjugations, I would have been bored and unmotivated. \n\nAnother good way to practice is to watch your favorite movie with the new language's subtitles. Watch it in English with the foreign subtitles, so you can read the words. Then watch again with the foreign dubbing, along with the foreign subtitles. When your confidence and abilities have increased, watch again with only the dubbing and no subtitles. \n\nIf you cook, another fast way to absorb the language is reading recipes. Recipes always have similar language patterns. There are the common verbs for mixing, frying, baking, folding, etc.and the common forms of measurement.  In a recipe, it's easy to see and understand a foreign language's mechanics and how it relates to English. You'll be translating very quickly. Take a recipe you know well. Maybe something like chocolate chip cookies. You basically already know what the recipe is saying. Looking at it in a foreign language, your brain instantly translates it and you will naturally pick up the new language's vocabulary and patterns. \n\nYou got this! Learning a new language when the people around you are discouraging is hell. But learning a new language on your own terms can be so exciting and fun. \n\nBest of luck to you. And tell your husband he's a jerk for letting his brother ridicule you. Next time he pronounces an English word in his Scandi accent, tell him it ain't sexy, it's stupid. See how he feels. (Just kidding. Don't do that. But you can tell him to encourage his family to support your language efforts and show some patience).", "Info: How many more years do you think it will be before you're able to speak conversationally with these folks in their language?

I work (more than) full-time in English, speak English at home, and by default consume English media in my spare time, and that just wasn't working, even taking a German course. Things accelerated dramatically when I took more lessons per week (and varied-- DuoLingo and Lingoda and \"Learn German with Anja\" all at once), picked German-language TV shows to watch (something like [this plugin](https://appforlanguage.com) can help immensely), listen to German music, set aside an hour a week with German-speaking coworkers to have a German meeting once a week, changed my phone to German language, and stopped asking anyone to switch to English.

They say it takes 500-600 hours of study to reach B2, but that highly varies depending on how much you force yourself to immerse. No one's an AH here yet.\n\nI'd suggest going to these family functions, and prepare a simple story or anecdote in the language on something topical, as well as some typical vocabulary on the topic. Get as far as you can. Then even if you don't say anything the rest of the gathering, they'll see you're trying. Then I'd suggest sitting with Google Translate open on your phone and try to listen to all the vocabulary around you you can. Look up words as you hear them. Listen. Don't bury yourself in English language phone content when you have a great opportunity to hear the language better amongst native speakers!

And my family has been so supportive. They talk English to them, but my mom's English isn't the best so she throws in different words as well. Which is actually been a great help for my partner to learn. My family makes sure my partner understands what's being said, and explains certain words and phrases to them that aren't common in English. My grandma doesn't speak English but still tries to talk to my partner by talking slowly so they can understand and otherwise have other people translate. \n\nMy partner, meanwhile, has been picking up so much in a short time because of this. It's amazing to see that both sides are learning a lot. It's nice. \n\nSo I don't know how much effort you are putting into learning the language, but if you really are trying, it's sad to see how your in-laws are acting. I don't think it's unreasonable to, at the bare minimum, not be laughed at when trying to learn the language. If your in-laws aren't willing to slow down, that's fine, that happens to me sometimes as well. Parents and people who speak English less well get talking and they don't have to slow down for one person.

His family make effort to talk to me in English what they can, I reply in french as much as I can. And my partner mostly translates in-between.

The first year I actually lived in France in an English speaking job and I've had every opportunity since then to improve my french but it's my fault I haven't much, I've tried, but not as hard as I could have. It's not easy! But if I can't follow every conversation and get left out, that's my problem, I don't expect everyone to slow down for me, or speak English for me. Your actually LIVING in this country? Honestly I think you need to make a bit more effort to learn and just accept the fact you won't always be able to follow all conversations. My partner's lived in England for a while now, his English is very good, but he still struggles in big groups. But it's just not possible for everyone to slow down or speak one by one so he can understand.

He should be encouraging his family who speak both languages to speak slowly and use simple phrases instead of long sentences with less familiar words. The burden shouldn\u2019t be solely on OP to build this relationship and learn the language. She already sacrificed her life and family in another country it\u2019s time for her husband and in laws to step up", "Trust me, his mom speaks perfect English. There is no one with above average IQ under 70 in the Nordic countries that doesn\u2019t speak English.", "So I\u2019m from Luxembourg, which is a small country with 3 official languages and where language is kind of a hot topic even politically. Luxembourgish is the national language and generally what \"native\" Luxembourgers and people who have grown up here speak with friends and family but we also use French and German as administrative languages. The Luxembourgish school system expects people to become fluent in all 3 languages plus English.\n\nWe also have a very large immigrant population and lots of cross border workers from neighbouring countries. Because Luxembourgers generally speak French and German relatively fluently, there's not a lot of pressure on foreigners to learn Luxembourgish. It's absolutely possible to live a very normal comfortable life in Luxembourg or work here without speaking a word of Luxembourgish and many people do just that. \n\nMany Luxembourgers find that a bit frustrating because we are generally expected to accommodate everyone else in terms of language while many (perhaps even most) of those people don't bother to return the favor (of course there are exceptions). Even if you are fluent in another language it does take a certain mental effort to speak it (at least for me). It seems a bit entitled to me to accuse people of being rude for speaking their own language in their own country with their own family although you haven't made any serious effort to learn theirs. I understand that moving to a new country and learning a new language is hard but I would say YTA here.", "NTA I don't think, but I do think it is very sus that the sister doesn't switch to English when you're around. When I lived in Sweden people switched automatically as a manner of course. I was told they considered it impolite not to, no one wanted to be exclusionary.  \n\nBTW, Babbel helped me the most out of anything I tried as far as getting functional Swedish, in case it helps. Maybe learning things in the language like \"please slow down, I'm learning\" or \"thank you for speaking with me, I'm trying\" would help them take you seriously?", "You literally said you haven\u2019t been learning as dedicated as you should because everyone accomodates you and you aren\u2019t forced to learn. Now you have his family who don\u2019t accomodate you and you would be forced to learn but somehow decided you don\u2019t want to be around them. \n\nThem slowing down would be nice but not necessary.

That sounds unbelievably lonely (and I'm a Scandinavian).", "This may be unpopular but I'm going with YTA. You have lived there for 3 years and have made little to no effort to learn the language and yet you expect them to always speak a second language for you? They are tired of your lack of effort and blaming them for your issues. It's not their fault or problem that you can't make the effort. Your actions show them that you don't care about being apart of their family even though they have made extensive efforts to include you. They have been patient with you for 3 years and you're going to throw a fit because they're tired of it?", "NTA but OP you have been in the country for a few years now? I think if you are struggling, you should invest in getting a tutor to help you learn, and that way you can have a better understanding overall. If you are using apps or trying to learn on your own, then you are not setting yourself up for success. Invest in a local tutor and you will start to see your understanding and knowledge of the language flourish. Good luck OP. If this was in the first year, I would understand, but you have been there for multiple years now and I think you need to step up at this point. \n\nThat being said... your inlaws are not being supportive and kinda rude when you are trying.

A few years later and you still don\u2019t know the language enough to follow along or make light conversation? Clearly, you are not trying hard enough. That, or if it really is difficult for you, you will just have to resign to this because you chose to move to a foreign country.\n\nAlso, this idea that just because people speak English that they should do it all the time is both entitled and xenophobic.  People tend to naturally communicate in one language over another, and the language that usually comes more naturally to them is their mother tongue.  They made the effort early on and for several years, and quite frankly, you should be thankful even for that. But now the ball is in your court - they don\u2019t need to cater to you years later, when you are living there and still have not learnt enough sufficiently. Either properly learn the language or stop complaining. \n\nHaving said the above, I do have some sympathy, as somebody who learned a foreign language and got made fun of in my early years.  Yes, it hurts and is discouraging, but I didn\u2019t actually let it discourage me.  I started speaking to myself (because knowing it in my mind is different than forcing my tongue to say these words).  And I talked a lot to strangers, especially taxi drivers because forcing yourself for 15-20 minutes is the right amount to make small progress. Maybe seek out friends who also speak English and have them stop and correct you when you go wrong. Or have one hour a day with your husband whee you don\u2019t speak any English So figure out a way that works best for you, but you have to force the issue on a regular basis and especially not use English as a crutch.", "Mild YTA\n\nI know learning a new language is hard and nerve-wracking. But you really only get out of it what you put into it. When you're hanging with his family, see it as an opportunity to just listen and try to follow along and add to the conversation when you can. Quietly ask your husband for clarification when you're a bit lost. This is really the best environment to learn a new language. Look at it as a gift, a challenge you're capable of rising to, rather than quitting and expecting everyone to cater to you. Being bilingual is awesome, take this opportunity!", "YTA.

Good chance they think you fall into that category and are respecting your space. Sad that your husband dismisses your feelings about the situation. My Swedish wife would intermittently fill me in on the discussion before I learned the language. Otherwise I was generally happy zoning out while they chatted. Maybe ask for translations intermitently to show that you\u2019re engaged in the convo. I would never consider it rude for someone in Sweden to speak Swedish, it\u2019s the default.\n\nYTA, but I think there are misunderstandings on both sides.

I moved for someone to a foreign country without speaking proficiency and had to learn the language on the spot. \n\n\nNo matter how much I tried, people would just get impatient and either interrupt my attempts or just leave mid-sentence while I was scrambling for vocabulary. At some point, I would also just end up sitting in a corner, not engaging anyone, or would just stay at home. After a few such meetings, my partner was asked why I'm always isolating. Yeah, like take a guess... The best part is, everybody there would speak perfect English, which in also fluent in.\n\nOn the flip side, whenever my partner and I visited my country, everybody (both my friends and family) would switch to English to accommodate him, no matter how fluent they were. It's just a custom that you don't speak a language near someone who can't understand it, because it's rude. That always made me notice the unfairness of it all, but at lest I wasn't ashamed of my friends, yay.\n\nIt's a difficult spot you're in and I sympathise with you. Try to put more effort into learning, but also keep your boundaries. You shouldn't feel so lonely and excluded in what's supposed to be your family.

One thing that's helped them is immersing themselves more in the language, for one friend it happened when they had kids, they learned the language as the kids did and they integrated in a wider social group rather than professionals and academics.

I learned my second language through immersion and I'm slowly working on my 3rd by doing a few minutes a day on different apps. In some ways learning language as a child is easier, but as an adult you have a lot of advantages too. You have a longer attention span, you already know the alphabet, grammatical terms, and a lot of different concepts. It's easier to learn that X means  menstruation for example than it is to learn menstruation the first time.

After 3 years you should've really already been fluent, especially if your native language is English. But since that doesnt matter anymore now, I do have some tips for you. You should ask your husband to only speak Norwegian to you, and if you don't understand it he just needs to slow down and explain. You need to surround yourself mainly with Norwegians, who are willing to help you learn the language. It is also incredibly important that you yourself need to stop speaking English. You need to start speaking Norwegian. It is scary at first, but it'll benefit you so much.

Unfortunately class based learning (unless quite intensive) isn't that effective. \n\nThere has been a lot of success for people learning language using immersion. Part of this is just making the commitment to exist in that language where possible. Change your phone and computer language to your target language, listen to all music in that language, watch TV in that language, read books in that language, only speak in that language where possible. This makes language learning a lot faster.\n\nI've lived in a Scandinavian country before and it's so easy to just get by with English but it's still a second language for them.

I was only there for a few months and my French was pretty terrible, but they were not getting that feedback from me, bc I just sat there nodding along and picking up ~20% of the convo. The assumption I think was that I was just shy and quiet (which, I am lol). It's hard to know how much or little someone is following unless they're constantly interrupting in their language saying \"what?! Huh?\", which obv you don't want to do as that's a bit rude. And it's kind of innately human to assume that people around you can understand you, it's just dumb dumb lizard brain logic but it's natural.\n\nOn top of your efforts to learn their language, when you're out you should try as hard as you can to make conversation, preferably in their language. If there's something you can't say or figure out, ask. Or say it in English. But ask for help, ask for clarification.

You've developed an entitlement around being spoken to in English (meaning you've not made inadequate effort to learn their language), and it sounds as if their patience has worn out.\n\nSpeaking a foreign language can get tiring, even when you can do it. I'm fluent in German, but I still find it more enjoyable and comfortable to speak English - my native tongue. It IS more effort to have to constantly translate in your head, and it can get exhausting. There's inevitably less freedom of expression, as you always know less words than your native language. \n\nBut yet you've expected this family (and everybody else) to constantly speak a language that isn't their native language, for YEARS now.

Rather than expecting every family function to be catered around your lack of effort, in learning the language. You even sound sulky, saying 'Mom' is 'more important' than you. It's not about 'importance' as a person. It's about what's reasonable to expect, in a different country. \n\nYou've been spoiled by people speaking English, and so have been lazy learning the language - and now you're reaping the consequences. I'm sorry you feel isolated, but learning the language would help that. They haven't 'isolated' you.

I'll also be happy to recommend certain resources or answer questions over PM.\n\nI was in your husband's position a few years ago: I'm a Norwegian who used to have a partner who moved to Norway after some time in a long-distance relationship. We were both learning the other's native language, but I'll admit I had at an advantage in that I did classes in that language for two years during high school.\n\nWhile they tried learning the language, and made a serious effort during certain periods, they never got past the point of feeling excluded when people were talking Norwegian around them. Feeling like I had to hold their hand whenever we were hanging out with my friends was a major part of my decision to break off that relationship.\n\nI'm not saying this to be mean. I'm saying this because eventually, your husband's family won't be the only ones annoyed with you for not learning the language. It will eventually get to him as well, and it's on you to make sure you're making the effort to be part of the language, culture and family before that happens. This is what you signed up for when moving to a country where you don't speak the language.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The most important point: Tell people in your life (family, coworkers, etc) to speak to you in your target language, and only switch to English if you can't understand by asking follow-up questions in that language. It's fine to explain to coworkers that you've recently realized you need to make more of an effort to learn. Some will be willing to stick to slower and simpler Norwegian to help you learn if you just explain the situation. Others will probably prefer to stick to English, if that's been established as your work language with that colleague. Respect their decision, as you are the one asking them for a favour.\n* Make sure you're actively learning at home with your husband. Agree to set times and/or days where Norwegian is the default language, and again, only switch if you really HAVE to.\n* When learning a new language, listening and speaking are the parts where people usually struggle. The key thing to understand is that this is NOT because those are inherently harder, it's just that almost everybody practices those parts less. You have a hard time participating in a conversation because you feel judged, so you withdraw from the conversation, instead of paying attention and practicing your listening skills. This can be tiring, and it's fine to take breaks, or go  off and have a conversation with someone else in English, but stop allowing yourself to zone out just because the conversation seems difficult.\n* Find ways to practice listening and speaking on your own. Begin listening to Norwegian music. Actively look up the lyrics, and sing along, even if your pronounciation is bad. Singing (at least if you're on your own) is a great way to practice the speaking part without feeling judged. It's also fantastic for vocabulary. There are also several podcasts and news sites in Norway aimed at learners.\n\nTaking a course is a great first step, but it's only a first step. The rest is on you.", "I read your post.

I spent many years trying to learn Spanish and I'm still pretty rotten at it, but when customers came into my work back in Florida that spoke Spanish & very little English, I would always try my best to speak Spanish to them.

For the first 8 months I was living with a family who made me feel like everything I did was wrong. Some of it verged into actual psychological abuse, which doesn't sound like it's your situation, but the long and short of it was that I was terrified to speak Danish at home in case I made a mistake. After 8 months they finally kicked me out, and my liaison took me in for the last 3 months of my exchange. \n\nOn my first night living with her, I went to say something in English at the dinner table, and she very gently stopped me and said, \"no, you speak Danish now. It's okay, we'll help you.\" She and her husband and son were as patient as they promised they would be, and if I stumbled over every other word and stopped twice a sentence to ask, \"hvordan siger du x p\u00e5 dansk,\" they would wait, and they would give me the word I was looking for, and we would carry on. After a month of me living with them, she called us for dinner one evening and her husband and I both yelled back that we'd be there in a second, and she eventually had to come drag us into the kitchen because we were so focused on debating the ethics of eating eggs from a hen that had been kept with a rooster. In Danish. She had to point out to me that I hadn't said a single English word in five minutes, because I honestly hadn't noticed. \n\nIf you are surrounded by people who mock and belittle you for your best efforts, you will stop making those efforts.

But You've had the time to slowly lower yourself in, and didn't. And that was a choice you made, because it was easiest for you.\n\nSo can you really fault them for, after three years, choosing something that's easiest for them? when people are done catering to you, you see it as jumping in, but everyone else just thinks you should have learned to swim by now.\n\nSo I guess you're in a sink or swim moment - and it's okay if that swim is a doggy paddle to stay afloat until you develop better strokes. Don't let the people who laugh at you bring you down or put you off, because you've now chosen to learn, and that's amazing.\n\nAs someone who loves learning languages, I recommend:\n\n- Duolingo (great starting point and the repetition helps - can get you to a B1 of you complete the course)\n- films and shows you already know but watch them in your target language. Kids shows are also good because the plots are simple and the context is often obvious. Netflix is good for this, and Disney+ also has some European languages (can't remember which ones).\n- music - even if you don't understand it right away, it's great for exposure to the sounds of the language, and it's such a confidence boost when you get a few weeks or months down the line and realise you can understand the song's lyrics\n- friends - sounds like you already do this, but friends to practice with is a massive bonus\n- penpals - i used interpals which is an online penpal site, but it helps with practicing writing and reading, especially more informal non-textbook language (plus, you can make more friends)\n- children's books - same as TV and films, it's good for understanding the plot.\n- semester long courses are great and all, but try an intensive course (these are usually multiple times a week, and for several hours. The one I took in German was twice a week for 3 hours) as they often will teach in the target language, and won't let you speak any other language. The immersion method works really well as it's a learn or die trying scenario. Though I recognise that schedules might not allow for intensive classes.\n- people watch. Go to cafes and eavesdrop. See what you can pick up, and listen to the sounds of the language.\n- Rosetta stone - it's like Duolingo a bit but much more speaking and listening focused.\n- check out more than one type of text book - some are better than others, some might suit you more, etc. Etc. Find a textbook that works for you. \n- read reference books - this is the boring part, but reading them helps you learn different sentence structures.\n- act like you're teaching someone else - if you can't explain it clearly to someone (even an imaginary someone) you don't know it well enough, so go back to that topic and revise it.\n\nHopefully this helps, and while I think you've made a blunder by taking until now to learn, it's good that you're learning! Don't give up! Learn out of spite of you must, because then you can eavesdrop on their conversations and see what they're saying when they think you can't understand.

Still don't think that gives fam right to be straight up mean.", "She doesn't need to be fluent though, she needs to understand her in-laws. She shouldn't need everyone else to speak a language they feel uncomfortable speaking at every family reunion for the rest of her life. She can always answer in English if she doesn't know the words since most would understand her.", "I mean, I don\u2019t believe it one bit tbh, there is no way that all of them unanimously didn\u2019t help at the start, but do you blame them 2.5 years down the track for not being impressed she only understands the very basics of the language? I don\u2019t, OP seems like an immature person who doesn\u2019t really love her husband, I have to question why she even moved there in the first place if she seemingly holds no love for this man or his family, I really hope her partner finds the post and leaves her arse", "Finnish isn't scandinavian, it's nordic. Finnish is hard for English speakers to learn bc it's an entire other language family.", "i don\u2019t think they\u2019re being mean honestly. i do think they\u2019re maybe not being as patient as they should be, but after 3 years, i would be frustrated if my family members partner only showed minimal effort to learn my nature language, and instead spent her time playing on her phone at family gatherings because of that choice", "Ehhhh. I was in a similar situation once. I have an ex who spoke a different language, and when they got around their family & friends, they\u2019d all speak that language. One time, my ex asked my I didn\u2019t speak all night & I said \u201cbecause no one spoke in English\u2026how was I supposed to?\u201d They didn\u2019t have much to say to that. Granted, I wasn\u2019t in a foreign country, and I had interest in learning their language to similarly converse with the matriarch of the family. No one made fun of me for trying to learn, but they also did not think to speak in English when I was around. \n\nI think OP definitely should have, and still should, put more effort in. But that\u2019s hard to do when everyone is shitting on you for trying.", "I've only done this the past time, other times I just kinda sit there waiting to be spoken to. I admit I'm an asshole for not trying harder, but I was never intentionally rude at the gatherings. Just lost my cool this past time", "I'm going to say NTA and it's because it goes beyond the language thing; it sounds like you've been isolated for a long time and unhappy for about as long. Are you happy in any other aspect of your life in Scandinavia? This might be an incompatibility thing, OP; you haven't said whether or not your husband does anything to mitigate the loneliness or support you in any way.", "I think it was Mohammed!", "He said he tries to include me, we're fine literally everywhere else. It's just around his fam, I don't expect his mom to speak English, I never have. But I wish I'd get more from him or interaction from English speaking fam members. But it's non existent", "If you're willing to put the money in, italki is a great language learning site. You have real life tutors who you video call. It's a great way to practice your speaking and listening in a non judgemental setting", "I'd try to make him understand how isolated and ignored these get-togethers make you feel. I think a little distance from the family parties makes perfect sense even if you guys reach an understanding.", "Couple of months . . . you think you can learn another language in just a couple of months? It absolutely can take years.", "Op says they've always been like that", "Wow of all the comments this is most useless advice \ud83d\ude02", "You\u2019re rude because you\u2019ve lived in a country three years and you expect everyone else to hold conversations in a foreign language to suit you. \n\nYTA. Peak anglophone entitlement.", "Right? I love how people are totally comfortable judging someone else's learning capability", "Im like this too. Reading and even writing come far easier to me than speaking and listening. Heck, I find it hard to distinguish what people are saying sometimes in my own native tongue.", "**Do you know what weaponized incompetence is?**  \n\n**...It's \u201cwhen an individual pretends that they can't perform a simple action so someone will do it for them.\u201d**\n\nThey\u2019re not 'excluding the fuck outta you', you are excluding yourself.  \u201cmaYbe not aS deDicaTed as I shouLd bE\u201d - yeah, you know it, but still want to blame other people.\n\nAfter *three whole years of living there*, you *mis*\\-managing *your own* language acquisition skills to the extent that at family gatherings you can\u2019t understand & want them to speak English, try to spin it that they\u2019Re laUghiNg aT mE , they\u2019Re eXcLudinG mE for your justifications.... YTA", "Maybe if you learned to use your brain, you wouldn't be in this predicament. At 30, you should definitely know better than to behave like a child who's feelings got hurt. Good luck with whatever your doing.", "That's legitimately rude and hurtful of them, and I would re-evaluate my relationship with the partner.", "There are  millions of immigrants in the US who have been here for years and aren't fluent in English. My own mother being one of them. Learning languages as an adult is not easy for many people, especially if they don't have the time to study a ton cuz they work or have other obligations.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like her partner is very supportive of her efforts, tbh. Speaking in Norwegian at home is such an obvious solution. I wonder if he\u2019s like my husband, who speaks urdu with his family but has no interest in helping me learn because they can communicate with me in English just fine and he doesn\u2019t give a rats ass if I speak Urdu or not. Having to only communicate with me in my (bad) second language when we share a language is a huge long term pain in the ass and he doesn\u2019t want to do it. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her husband feels similarly here.", "This is really rude and presumptuous.", "Everyone else in the country speaks English fluently though. Including the family, who CHOOSE to exclude her.", "I hate people who think things that are easy for them are easy for everyone else.", "After 3 years of no effort from OP I would stop trying too", "Yes it is. It's not Nordic, but it's definitely Scandinavian.", "I don\u2019t speak a word of Finnish (except perkele) but the moment that chorus hits and I\u2019m all \u201cPid\u00e4n kaksin k\u00e4sin kiinni juomista niinku cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha\u201d at the top of my lungs.", "Well he\u2019s likely your best resource to learning his family\u2019s dialect. Ask him to start teaching you by talking to you more around the house when it\u2019s just the two of you.", "People on this thread keep repeating this, but I\u2019ve yet to see any source for it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Everyone who actually read the post knows it's been for years.", "Just throwing this out there, but I've heard from a lot of different sources that the Scandinavian languages are amongst the absolute hardest to learn as an adult. My mom's side is Norwegian and two of my cousins learned it as adults and they often joke \"we understand it but we don't speak it\".", "Yeah, OP needs to find some friends or a language group who will help her by speaking the native language.", "Um, hard disagree. Live in Norway for over 20 years, and with Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l and dialects....it's HARD. Even Norwegians will say they can't understand some Northern Norwegians! And some people aren't good at language. I can read it, and if I concentrate on the conversation maybe understand it. But I speak it like a person speaking English, and I write like a toddler, simply because my husband who is Norwegian does things that require advanced things. I've spent zoning out on family gatherings because I didn't care, or couldn't participate because of the subject matter. OP, so not NTA (move to Norway be my friend).", "How will I sleep tonight. \n\nIf you live in a country it is probably more of an effort to not learn the language than to learn it.", "The US foreign service institute for one source. Just Google \u201cSwedish and English similarity\u201d or something like that. \n\nBut on a general level it\u2019s way easier to learn languages with close relations linguistically than more different ones. English has mostly germanic grammar with latin influence on the vocabulary so Germanic and latin languages will be the easiest. \n\nIm not sure if English people might learn a latin language quicker than a Scandinavian one but both are way easier than wildly different languages. \n\nScandinavian languages are similar to English in many ways. You can almost direct translate a lot of stuff word for word and you\u2019ll only sound slightly goofy. I know since I had to learn it the other way. French and German grammar was way more of a hassle.", "Shooo lmao I cannot roll my Rs despite years of Spanish and legit trying in every way possible. I cannot seem to do it??? I can\u2019t get my tongue to cooperate with the motion. Annoying af tho", "I watched a Norwegian show, and it was difficult for me to even process the language as words \ud83d\ude02 And I speak only English. It sounded beautiful, but it was so difficult to comprehend as a language. I haven't had the same issue with any other foreign language film/show, but this was also the first thing I've watched in Norwegian.", "A Danish person onc said that Danish is Swedish but with your mouth full of potates. Made me giggle because it really does sound that way", "I mean... Norwegian is literally considered one of the easiest language for a native English speaker to learn. With immersion you should be able to communicate fairly effectively in less than a year. \n\nIcelandic I think has a lot of old fashioned grammar rules that have since phased out after modern English evolved. Finnish is a whole other story."]}
