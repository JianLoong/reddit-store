So, I moved here. NOW I would just like to pre-face that I am learning the language, maybe not as dedicated as I should be BUT it's coming on slowly. Adding that everyone here speaks nearly perfect english (my native lang) hasn't forced anything really. \n\nEveryone except his mother, she speaks very poor english and we have not really communicated much with each other, outside of translations. So at family functions I just kinda sit there waiting for someone to talk to me, I'm not really included in conversations or plan making. Sometimes they be talking and talking and they will stop to ask me a question about the convo they are having, I give an answer then they carry on in their own language. \n\nNow I kinda get why they speak around mom that way, she's more important and excluding her would be like A-level douche. Except, when we go out with his brother and his gf they all talk without including me and they all speak english perfect. In other situations going out with friends and co-workers they understand and usually make a point to speak english around non-speakers so they feel included. But my husband doesn't do that with his bro and his girl. Slighty hurts my feelings, especially when they make a point to invite me so i 'feel included' then just exclude the fuck outta me. \n\nI started learning the language, trying harder to speak with them. But the last two times, his mom would not slow down for me even after asking and his brother just laughs at my attempts, grammar, pronunciation- not very encouraging. \n\nSo, I will confess at this point a few years later it's exhausting and lonely in those moments, especially when I consider how close I am with family, how welcoming they are, and how excluded I feel here. Last time we visit, I basically just sat on my phone and maybe had one to many drinks because i was feeling salty and sad. Apparently this was a problem because it looked like I didn't care. I told him time and time how it was and he idk he just doesn't see the problem and insists they include me. \n\nWe got in a huge fight and I basically said I don't wanna go to family functions anymore, which he said cannot happen because I will be expected. \n\nSo AITA here? \n\nThis is a throw away account because he knows my main lol", "created_utc": 1684838895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pkxpx/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_around_his_family_when/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You mentioned few years, so I'm assuming at least 3. If you haven't been able to converse even after that, then you need to look at how you are learning the language. At some point you need to ask yourself if you can ever learn this language and then have a chat about your future in the country with your husband.", "YTA\n\nI am an American living in Denmark.  If you have been there two years and have not picked up the basics.  Your attempt to pick up the language is minimal at best.  Taking a course and going to a language cafe is a good start but you need practice that is without your husband or his family.\n\n1. Join some kind of club where you will be forced to pick up the language or attend church.  (I started playing Dungeons and Dragons. Kind of geeky but it really helped).\n2. Find the part of the language that you find difficult and practice.  Danish is easy to read and write but pronunciation is really hard.  I practice speaking every chance I get and I watch movies or TV shows in Danish with Danish subtitles.  So I can see and understand what I am hearing.\n3. Everyone speaks prefect English to pretty good English here and in most Scandanavian countries, but there are times when I have to speak Danish. I will admit the first four to five months I was pretty lazy because it was easy to speak English.  The times I needed to learn Danish were few and far between.  This is why I think you are an AH.  It was too easy not to learn and now you expect everyone to cater to you.\n\nForce yourself to learn the language and do not give up just because it is hard. If you realize your pronunciation is not the best, then just roll with it.  If they make fun, turn the tables on them and say okay... teach me how to say it properly.  After 10 to 20 times to get you to say it properly, I guarantee you, you will be getting some practice, they will see you are trying.  The comments will stop.\n\nSome of what his family are doing is going into the AH territory. But I think they have the right to expect better progress from you.  Danes, just like Americans, expect people to learn the language if someone is choosing to live in their country.", "As a Swede, ESH. \n\nYes, you can get away with not speaking Swedish if you live in one of the larger cities and your social circle skews young. Especially if you work in an academic field. I speak very little Swedish at work due to having a lot of immigrant colleagues and most of the technical language I need not existing in Swedish anyway so why force that awkwardness on everyone at a meeting. I'm also happy to speak English in social settings where everyone is comfortable with it. \n\nIn social situations where not everyone is comfortable, however, the default is to speak the majority language (in this case whatever Scandinavian language is relevant) so that as many people as possible can understand. I've been on the receiving end of this when dating a guy from a country where I didn't know the language and English isn't the default second language for Gen X or older (we still lived in Sweden, though) and it sucks, but it is what it is. His family was kind enough to whisper-translate to me (whoever was closest and comfortable with English) and I managed to pick up a little of the language over our few visits and some studying at home. \n\nYou suck because you haven't (by your own admission) put in as much of an effort as you should have and are asking his family members to be uncomfortable in their own homes, he sucks for not translating and his family sucks for laughing at your attempts. It shouldn't be a problem to occasionally repeat yourself if someone doesn't catch what you say (I sometimes have to because of my dialect even when speaking to native speakers, it's not a problem), and laughing at someone's pronunciation or grammar is just rude. If an accidental pun happens due to such errors, my policy is to explain and then laugh together or not at all.", "They\u2019re probably mad with you for not trying harder to communicate with them, so they don\u2019t try harder to communicate with you. You\u2019re probably mad at them because you feel like they don\u2019t include you because of the language barrier. \n\nI think your husband can be the mediator and translator here, as I assume he speaks well in both languages and clear the air. This may make you all feel more comfortable and understood, including your husband as it means he won\u2019t have to choose between spending time with his family and you.\n\nThen if the behaviour/feelings continue, it\u2019s probably not a language thing and it might be because ESH.", "YTA. You are living in whichever Scandinavian country your husband comes from, and you're complaining about people in that country talking in their native tongue.

You don't care. You're not trying. The person excluding you is you, by your refusal to put any reasonable amount of effort in to learning the language.\n\nYou say that the fact that most people speak good English \"hasn't forced anything\". What you mean is that you made the choice to be selfish, and rely on everyone else being able to speak your language, so you didn't have to bother with theirs.\n\nYour whole post reeks of entitlement.", "Moving to another country is hard especially when you dont know the language and the culture.

Sounds like they made accommodation for you in the beginning and when they felt you weren\u2019t that bothered they gave up.\nIf you aren\u2019t happy and are finding it too difficult/socially awkward to embrace a new language then it\u2019s probably time to cut your losses and go home.

I don\u2019t blame you for being less engaged in a conversation you cannot follow, especially if they\u2019re not giving you some grace during the learning period and even mocking you for your attempts. \n\nThat said you should definitely listen to the people that are calling you an AH and advising you to step up your efforts to learn. There\u2019s a lot of good advice in some of those comments.

His brother making fun of your grammar and pronunciation is uncalled for. That his mother wouldn't slowdown, a normal request from someone learning, indicates she isn't interested in doing so. That's, of course, her prerogative, but if it's a smaller gathering it's definitely exclusive. You've also seen them treat other English speakers differently, which is adding to the feelings of exclusion.\n\nKeep learning, maybe step it up a bit, but, yeah, I wouldn't want to go if you're going to get mocked for attempting to speak the language anyway, either. No point in going before you're more proficient if that's the attitude, anyway", "INFO: do you practice with your husband?

A couple more, too, like \"I'm sorry; I'm having trouble understanding,\" etc.\n\nAs for the brother and his wife, if it's just the four of you, I would interrupt every single thing they say with, \"Could we please speak English? [Said in English] I'm working very hard on my XYZish, but I can't keep up.\" Literally keep saying it every single time they say a word in the other language, as if they must just be sweet, dumb idiots who forgot you don't speak XYZish fluently yet.\n\nAnd yeah, of course, double down on your lessons. I feel like I have to say that to head off the comments I'll get otherwise. But the point is that these people (besides mom) DO speak your language, and they know that you're trying to learn theirs. I'm an American, and when I speak to someone here with limited English, I do everything I can to accommodate them, because I'm not a fucking asshole.\n\nOh! One more thought, depending on your relationship with your MIL... Maybe you could float the idea of offering to help her with her English, as she helps you with your XYZish?

You learn the language of where you're living.  You learn the culture.  You learn the laws.  You absorb yourself into the land in which you live.  You're allowed to keep some of your culture and language with you, that's perfectly respectable.

Dunno where you are from but at least here the free school for learning the language is pretty bad. Additionally there is not much media to consume because almost no one speaks the language, so you are stuck watching kids movies or listening to boring news. And it took me a loong time to even be able to access the free Swedish classes. The Swedes can be super distant - I noticed really quick that at bars a group is either 90% Swedes or 90% immigrants (of different nationalities and speaking different tongues). Integration is NOT easy, your partner needs to wholly support you if he wants you to make it. But it becomes frustrating for them to have to slow down, and to repeat words for you. I have only met one Swedish person who will unwaveringly attempt to speak Swedish with me and teach me, and it is thanks to him I have improved so much.", "YTA while I don\u2019t think they have been the most welcoming to you, this really was on you to learn the language the moment you decided to move there (personally I would have been starting to learn it when you got serious dating).

Just cuz they can, doesn't mean they have to. \n\nIt's great that you are making efforts now. Classes are a good foundation, but from my experience, I found the fastest way to learn a language is to put yourself in a brand new situation, away from any family/friends who might jump in and start translating or helping you, or discouraging you. \n\nJoin a new activity. Maybe a hiking club, or something you enjoy. You'll meet new people. Introduce yourself using ONLY their language. Do not use any English. Emphasize how you want to improve your language skills. These new people will know your goal from the start, and will help you. The vocabulary of the shared activity will easily translate into the new language for you, and you will have conversations on topics that are outside of the usual \"where are you from, what do you do?\" \n\nThat's how I ended up learning French.

These are things I can talk about endlessly in English, and figuring out how to speak on these things in a new language was my gateway in. Had I just sat down with a bunch of conjugations, I would have been bored and unmotivated. \n\nAnother good way to practice is to watch your favorite movie with the new language's subtitles. Watch it in English with the foreign subtitles, so you can read the words. Then watch again with the foreign dubbing, along with the foreign subtitles. When your confidence and abilities have increased, watch again with only the dubbing and no subtitles. \n\nIf you cook, another fast way to absorb the language is reading recipes. Recipes always have similar language patterns. There are the common verbs for mixing, frying, baking, folding, etc.and the common forms of measurement.  In a recipe, it's easy to see and understand a foreign language's mechanics and how it relates to English. You'll be translating very quickly. Take a recipe you know well. Maybe something like chocolate chip cookies. You basically already know what the recipe is saying. Looking at it in a foreign language, your brain instantly translates it and you will naturally pick up the new language's vocabulary and patterns. \n\nYou got this! Learning a new language when the people around you are discouraging is hell. But learning a new language on your own terms can be so exciting and fun. \n\nBest of luck to you. And tell your husband he's a jerk for letting his brother ridicule you. Next time he pronounces an English word in his Scandi accent, tell him it ain't sexy, it's stupid. See how he feels. (Just kidding. Don't do that. But you can tell him to encourage his family to support your language efforts and show some patience).", "Info: How many more years do you think it will be before you're able to speak conversationally with these folks in their language? What are you doing to show you're invested in the family in the meantime?", "YTA after 3 years you should be able to manage at least basic conversations. Being around people speaking the language is the fastest way to learn once you have the foundation. Try harder", "YTA I\u2019m afraid.

It\u2019s down to you to learn the language and integrate.\n\nSo your partner and his family not speaking English is actually helping you, if they continue to speak English you\u2019ll never learn the language, you need immersion in it to become fluent. \n\nI experienced this when I moved to Mexico in my 20s as I had a Mexican GF from Uni. I didn\u2019t speak a word of Spanish, but I just had to knuckle down and get on with it if I wanted to be part of the society.\n\nI distinctly remember my breakthrough moment was when I had a conversation with a friend who spoke both Spanish and English and I couldn\u2019t remember immediately afterwards what language we\u2019d had the conversation in  - he told me later it was Spanish.

Plus, the brother laughing at her isn't cute. The husband needs to see her side, too.\n\nMy ex lives in Turkey, and his mom speaks *zero* English. I know, like, 2 phrases and a few random words of Turkish, but when we were around her, she would wait for him to translate, and she was SO sweet to me.

I could pay tuition and take 100 courses and learn nothing if I didn't genuinely make the effort. \n\nThat being said, it's not kind to make fun of someone's proficiency in a second language. Your BIL sounds like he's over it, and maybe your MIL is, too. So, not great but I can also imagine circumstances where folks are tired of accommodating if they don't think you're meeting them halfway. \n\nWhat do you feel is a reasonable expectation from them after 3 years? Is it possible the relationship with the in-laws has already been damaged so they've decided to stop being accommodating?", "I think it's unreasonable to expect them to slow down or speak in English after a certain time. You need to accept that responsibility and can use that as an excuse to hang out less with his family.\n\nTell your husband you are still bad at his language and as a result cannot understand his family. Work on language for few months with him, co-workers n any friends you have there. Stay away from his family for 6 months n hopefully you will get better in that time.", "I moved to a German-speaking region in my 40's, so I know how hard it can be. I work (more than) full-time in English, speak English at home, and by default consume English media in my spare time, and that just wasn't working, even taking a German course. Things accelerated dramatically when I took more lessons per week (and varied-- DuoLingo and Lingoda and \"Learn German with Anja\" all at once), picked German-language TV shows to watch (something like [this plugin](https://appforlanguage.com) can help immensely), listen to German music, set aside an hour a week with German-speaking coworkers to have a German meeting once a week, changed my phone to German language, and stopped asking anyone to switch to English. You really have to force yourself to use and absorb the language or it won't stick. It will be uncomfortable, give you literal headaches, and make you tired. But you'll get it. Now I'm finally reaching B2 level after 6 years, while my SO did it in 4. B2 is what you need to follow and participate in casual conversations.\n\nSo I'm going to say NAH yet. You obviously need to try harder with the language. But 3 years is an in-between time, where the locals think surely you've had enough time by now to learn, but really, it is hard and takes longer than that. They say it takes 500-600 hours of study to reach B2, but that highly varies depending on how much you force yourself to immerse. No one's an AH here yet.\n\nI'd suggest going to these family functions, and prepare a simple story or anecdote in the language on something topical, as well as some typical vocabulary on the topic. Get as far as you can. Then even if you don't say anything the rest of the gathering, they'll see you're trying. Then I'd suggest sitting with Google Translate open on your phone and try to listen to all the vocabulary around you you can. Look up words as you hear them. Listen. Don't bury yourself in English language phone content when you have a great opportunity to hear the language better amongst native speakers! And... shouldn't you have a private tutor at home as well?\n\nAnyway, good luck. Language and culture shock is tough. You can do it, though.", "At least when you speak, it is an accent they are used to.  I had to practice an hour a day to get to the point where I could understand and respond to the basics.  Language apps are great, and you practice for 10 mins or just a few minutes when you have some free time.", "I encountered a lot of people in Germany who refused to speak English to me. Mostly because they felt uncomfortable and weird. I really do understand it is hard, I was in your shoes, but there is no going around it. You have to learn  the language and take an active role in the family life, if you plan to stay.", "Are they talking to you in they're native language, or are they ignoring your presence? If it's the first then they might be trying to help you out by giving you a chance to practise. Your husbands brother sucks for laughing at you, but this can also be him not understanding how self conscious one feels when trying to pronounce a new language. Honestly it might all be miscommunication where you feel excluded, and they're trying to be inclusive but it's not translating correctly.", "It reminds me of when my partner is with my family. They all speak English so they can understand, but they're also teaching them as they talk because sometimes people don't know words. They teach them phrases we use and explain things that don't work in English. Meanwhile, my partner is doing their best to learn and keep up, and will use certain words and phrases, especially if they've been trying to teach them. It's lovely, and also good fun, because we learn from each other.\n\nI can't imagine what it must be like if you get excluded and laughed at for trying to learn. I'm always super self-conscious, so I wouldn't even dare to try. If that happened to my partner I would be so disappointed and sad and not comfortable bringing my partner to my family. I want them to feel welcome and included, and I'm lucky to have an amazing family who does everything they can to make that so.", "Did it always start out that way or is it just because years later they still can barely speak any of the language?", "It took OP 3 years to start learning the language seriously, because she was just too happy to be accomodated all the time. I would consider that to be pretty rude if she were my sister-in-law too. (however, I wouldn\u2019t ridicule her, but I wouldn\u2019t be accomodating either, after three years).", "I totally agree but we dont know more context. How long has she been there? She mentioned that they would talk about something, stop and then ask her about her opinion or some questions? It seems to me that they try to include her sometimes but if its not mutual and she seems uniterested they might give up on that. I agree making fun of somebody for not speaking the language is offensive and mean and her husband should step up, have a talk with his family about respecting his wife more and help her as much as he can with learning the language and communicating with his family. Being in a different country is hard and last thing you want is to be lonely and excluded", "INFO, when did you get the course, how intensive it was?\n\nIn the end it's not about the course, it's about the effort.

Great that they are supporting you in this - I'd got the impression from your post they just tend to stick to English around you.  \n\nGood luck with the lessons.", "No, I'm merely extrapolating that it will be an additional factor in play as to why she can't just avoid the functions even if she doesn't learn the language, so they might say that she does not know the value of a family and it might be a requirement in their religion to keep showing up everywhere as a happy family. \n\nWhich is where the insistence from the husband might be coming from given he's not translated to her in family discussions or even asked others to be more patient. Religion can never be ruled out to not cause problems in life.", "I mean that's fair, but if I'm a burden when I'm around, I don't know why I'm expected to be there and they think it's rude if  I don't come \ud83e\udd37", "Idk i felt it kinda rude they just shut down attempts I made to try to converse. Strangers I get, but I activley tried to converse and they just shrugged it off and laughed at me. It actually hurt my feelings a little.

I'm 18 months in a German speaking country and have been learning German for about 14 months.

The latter is really useful, especially with subtitles, as it's more basic. You may still learn about bears and reindeer but not so much about lawyers and engineers!", "Could also very well be Culture shock. Scandinavians are very comfortable making fun of each other and I could easily see BIL do Scandinavian teasing that is received in a harsher way than he might have meant.", "Hell, I even learn new words in my mother language wich I speak for like 20 years, and sometimes mispronounce something. Shit happens. But never ever would I think about laughing in a mean way when someone is trying and doesn't get sht right. I maybe can't conceal a laugh because I know what the person is trying to say vs what they are saying, but then I help and we can both laugh about it.", "According to OP, she\u2019s been there for three years and only recently started seriously learning", "I did, apologies", "\u201cSince the culture there is big into family and religion\u201d is confusing when talking about Scandinavia and unusual enough that she probably would have mentioned it though!", "My partner has lived in my country for 5 years. Like you, learning the language has been going slow because pretty much everyone speaks English as well. Since we've been together they've been learning more because we've been around my family. And my family has been so supportive. They talk English to them, but my mom's English isn't the best so she throws in different words as well. Which is actually been a great help for my partner to learn. My family makes sure my partner understands what's being said, and explains certain words and phrases to them that aren't common in English. My grandma doesn't speak English but still tries to talk to my partner by talking slowly so they can understand and otherwise have other people translate. \n\nMy partner, meanwhile, has been picking up so much in a short time because of this. It's amazing to see that both sides are learning a lot. It's nice. \n\nSo I don't know how much effort you are putting into learning the language, but if you really are trying, it's sad to see how your in-laws are acting. I don't think it's unreasonable to, at the bare minimum, not be laughed at when trying to learn the language. If your in-laws aren't willing to slow down, that's fine, that happens to me sometimes as well. Parents and people who speak English less well get talking and they don't have to slow down for one person. But then we also make sure that there is enough conversation to include the other person. \n\nIt's hard to judge your situation because I don't know the family nor you, but if you really are trying and honest with yourself, then it's totally valid to feel a little lonely at your partner's family. I hope things get better!", "Because that's signaling you don't want to be part of the family (which is possibly true, tbf). They probably expected you to try and be part of the group, but not only did you not learn the language, not use the opportunity when you hang out to learn the language, but you literally don't want to talk to them. I have a hard time believing you can't understand a language after 3 years living in another country if you actually gave a effort, so your exclusion isn't only their fault the way it would be if they didn't speak English at all the first time you guys met.", "Put it this way. Your partner says you have to be there, seems like it\u2019s important to him. Whereas for you, you give off the idgaf attitude in every sentence you write. If you care about him at all, you would\u2019ve put a FULL effort into learning his language to connect with his mom. Your behaviour of not picking it up even a bit after 3yrs confirms your attitude and his whole family knows it. Learning a language means native speakers WILL laugh at what you say sometimes, that just comes with the territory. \n\nIf you give half a shit about the relationship you\u2019d fully immerse yourself in courses to learn the language. 6m from now you should be able to hold a basic conversation, if not, you\u2019re not actually trying.", "My partner is from a neighbouring country. We've been together for 6 years. We basically speak the same language, but there are some differences. When they're all together, they speak a dialect. I do not understand a word they say, and I've told them that. I don't see the point in me being there, if I can't communicate, and they don't want to talk to me in a way that I understand. So now I only go for Xmas, or his parents Birthdays. He's fine with that. I have better things to do, than be somewhere where I can't understand what's being said.", "It is rude but that's how most people are across the world. People will sympathize with your struggles initially but then they get back to their normal way of talking very soon. You should talk to people who have immigrated in this country like you.

Native people are often unaware of how weird and confusing the language can be to the outsiders.", "I feel this so much.

There are few... unfortunates words in my language that if you only slightyyyy mess it up, you're saying something *very* different. It's funny to laugh at it together, because we're also comfortable about it. We both know there is no mean thought behind it, and it's just fun to learn together. And the same goes with my family, they're so welcoming and open that it's also perfectly fine to laugh at some things without anyone feeling embarrassed. (I sometimes screw up because I'm talking so much English, and will translate some phrases that just don't work in my language. I get laughed at too, and I also laugh at myself.) \n\nIt just really depends on the way it's happening, doesn't it? Being mean because someone messes up is just sad.", "Well thats a long time.
