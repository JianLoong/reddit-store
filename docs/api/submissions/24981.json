I work from home and am the primary caregiver for both of our kids.\nOur 8 yo recently switched to a different and better school, which happens to be minutes away from my stepdaughter\u2019s school.

I assumed that nobody was available to take her since he said when nobody was available in our previous conversation. I think it\u2019s important to know that Both the 8 & 9 year olds start school at the same so this is a problem. I said I would try it anyway. But in doing so, it became very hectic trying to get both kids ready at once, feeding them breakfast, getting the baby ready, etc. Ended up leaving 8 minutes later than planned so my step daughter was on time and my son was borderline late/running to class. So I told my husband I couldn\u2019t take her every day and questioned why I had to when her Mom was home. He said I left too late & started saying things like \u201cI didn\u2019t know it would be such a big deal to help me out\u201d & \u201csorry my children are such an inconvenience for you.\u201d Etc. I explained that shes not an inconvenience, but has a perfectly ready and available parent to take her, it was hard getting everyone ready on time, the kids were playing and not getting ready, plus the baby, all of it. I reminded him that when we spoke, he said emergencies and when nobody was available but her Mom called her this morning to tell her to have a good day and where to be picked up so this wasn\u2019t the case today.  I told him his children are his responsibility and he cant get upset when I cant take responsibility for them as well as my own children and that it wasn\u2019t fair to expect that. \n\nI cant help but wondering if this was his plan all along- to move my son schools and then assign me to carpool without even communicating- especially since he doubled down and was saying his kids were an inconvenience and trying to guilt me. If the situation had been fully communicated, I would have said no. My schedule is crazy enough trying to manage the house, my job, and an 8 month old while working. \nHowever, I cant help feeling like an asshole. If they we\u2019re being dropped off at the same school, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.

Could you make all this work? Sure. But that isn't what this is about. It is about the principle of the matter. Your husband wasn't up front with his intentions at all, and I think he is likely happy to not have the extra fuss of taking his daughter to her mom's house every morning so mom can handle getting her ready and dropping her off at school (and I'm sure mom is happy not to have to bother too). Emergencies and on call are one thing, but this is obviously not what is happening. I think you need to take a hard stance on this before it just becomes expected that you are going to do it every day. I think that every time he asks you to take her, you need to ask him if it is an emergency and if he says yes, refuse to commit until he tells you what the emergency is or what the circumstances are that keep him/the mom from being able to do it. Press him for that info, and don't back down and don't do it if his answer is not acceptable. NTA, OP, and good luck!", "INFO: how did your relationship begin? He has a child with someone else that\u2019s only a year older than the child you have with him?", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA.

Husband doesn't help *AT ALL* in the morning routines, so he doesn't get to add a kid into the mix.  Daughter can stick with her regular routine of her *dad and mom* parenting her.", "i can't believe people are saying you are TA given that you have an 8-month-old and a FT job.  and yea school traffic sucks. \n\nsounds like it's not a favor to him as much as it helping out the ex too. what is she doing while you are managing chaos?", "NTA. Reddit just likes to poop on step-parents who aren't constantly bending over backwards. It's easier for her mum to drop her off, it's part of their routine, she gets time with her mum in the morning and everyone is on time. This arrangement is fine, what reason would your husband have for wanting to change it?", "ESH - You are not playing as team members of the same team. Including your step daughter into your daily routine is not a significant \"hardship\".\n\nHe should had told you that from the start. And you would had been TA if you had said \"no\".\n\nOtherwise, what you are saying is that you don't feel responsible for his kids, and he shouldn't  feel responsible for yours.\n\nWhich sounds crazy.", "why dont u just drop one off earlier than the other lol i dont get it", "Some of the comments here are wild. OP is NTA. She is being super helpful by taking her stepdaughter into school when he is on call. It is not her responsibility to drop her stepchild off at school when he isn't on call. Do people not remember how insane it is to take care of an 8 month old while getting older kids to and from school/events? One blowout diaper can put the entire morning out of sync. If your husband asks you to take your stepchild in and he isn't on call, I would suggest that he drop the two older kids off instead. Leaving you to breastfeed in peace and get ready for your work day.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband, stepdaughter, and stepdaughter's mother have a dropoff routine that does not involve you except for when he's on call one week each month. You help out when he's on call and make things work.\n\nHe tried to switch it up and get you start taking core of dropoffs even when he's not on call. Surprising you with that at the last minute was a dirty trick. Not being honest about her mom being available to do the dropoff as usual was an overt lie of omission.\n\nHe seems very not trustworthy IMO.", "NTA. You can't just drop a child off extra early for school. There's a pretty narrow and inflexible window. If there isn't enough time to get to one school, deal with traffic in the drop-off line, get to the other school, and deal with traffic in the other drop-off line, one kid is going to be tardy. If it happens more than on a very rare occasion, that's going to cause problems with truancy laws (at least it would in my state). \n\nIn an emergency, that's ok - and it sounds like what you agreed to. But it sounds like your husband has decided he doesn't want to take the time to leave for work however much earlier he has to every day in order to take his daughter to her mother's house, even if she's available.", "What is the alternative?  Do you expect your husband to do drop off for his daughter or her mother to come all the way to your home to get her and take her to school?  If so Yta.  You are going that way, it seems logical to take both kids. Now it\u2019s fair to ask for help to get everyone ready in the morning but expecting your husband to drive separately when you are going that way is petty.", "YTA. You married a man with children, when they are in your home during his parenting time you are part of the parenting team. Both children are old enough to get themselves ready, if it is so difficult to make breakfast for one extra child, then start a little earlier so you can get out the door in time to drop them both off.", "[deleted]", "There\u2019s not a bus?", "More Info Needed:\n\nOP, that week of the month, why doesn't the mom pick her daughter up on her way home from work? Then she can take her kid home, get her ready and off to school?\n\nOr, have you considered renting a stop on a private school bus? Many people in your position pay a fee for pickups. Schedule it for before you leave with your child, and she can ride the bus to school. If it's only one week a month, it should not be a big deal or even too expensive.", "NTA about being upset about the struggle. Mornings can be hectic. I wonder how things would play out if you had commitments a few times that prevented you from getting them ready and dropped off at school and your husband did the carpooling and corralling a few mornings each month. I'm sure you'll find a reasonable routine after a dozen first hand experiences on how crazy it gets. That being said, YWBTA if you treated your stepdaughter like a chore and a problem. The problem isn't her or who's responsibility because she came with the package and is now part of your family. The problem is lack of teamwork and communication. Hopefully, with a little perspective y'all can work something fair and equal out. Good luck.", "YTA - when you married him you knew he had children and that they would also become your children\u2026 right? Or did he keep the kids a secret until after you were married?", "YTA- leave earlier and get over it. It amazes me when I hear someone who has step kids act like they have no responsibility for them. You are expecting their mom to come all the way over and pick her up and take her to school because it was\u2026stressful? Parenting is stressful. Plan your day/ morning better, you have 4 kids, not two. Drop one of the kids off a little early and get the others there on time. Put on your big girl panties and be a responsible mom.", "Nta", "INFO: How far away are these schools from your house?", "INFO: Does your husband have primary custody of your stepdaughter? is that why he drops her off to her mom every morning?", "INFO - what does the mother think about this?  I didn\u2019t see you mention how many days a week step daughter stays at your house, but if it\u2019s all weekdays, I\u2019d imagine the mother likes the little bit of extra time she gets with her. You two should ~~double team him~~ team up and take him down.", "Why aren\u2019t both kids going to the same school?", "You need to keep him know that you see through him, that way he'll stop.\n\n\"You are trying to get me to take her every day. You ain't slick. You thought you could work up to making me do all of it. It's not happening. I only take over for you when you're on call, and even that is very hard on me.

I'm not here to do everything for you and you won't use me.\"\n\nNTA", "Your schedule is overwhelming, and I'm just reading it. I'm sorry OP.\n\n\nFor both kids, I'm confused - is there no school bus?  Or could you all create a carpool system with other parents in the neighborhood?  \n\n\nThis said, the way your husband is acting is NOT great. I get the vibe that he wants you to be the full-time parent and perhaps quit your job.  \n\n\nIf the baby isn't in daycare yet, pls put them in daycare. You need a break.\n\n\nNTA", "INFO: I saw this elsewhere on reddit - given that your husband thinks it's no problem to get both kids ready plus baby, just say, 'ok husband, can you show me how it's done?  I'll take notes.'  \n\n\nLet him show you how to get 3 kids ready plus yourself and get them to school.  And if he refuses, his refusal tells me that he knows he's asking the impossible of you. And doesn't care.  \n\n\nThat's not a healthy partner. This isn't a healthy marriage.", "Finally, someone who gets it. I don\u2019t mind helping out, totally not that. But this isn\u2019t her normal routine or mine and its really the sneakiness of the communication that bothers me. It feels like his intentions were to slowly build up and get me to eventually do it all the time without communicating that.", "thank you! agree!", "I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not the only one wondering about that math.", "Yeah, I'm kind of stuck on that. Very relevant. Affair partner/affair baby is my guess.", "Yep. Long story but irrelevant to this post.", "That\u2019s exactly my point. I feel like some of these people leaving hateful comments either dont have kids, haven\u2019t worked from home, haven\u2019t worked around an infant or sat in school traffic. Or all of the above. THANK YOU.", "No, I do it all. He starts work at 6 am when not on call and gets home at 5 pm. Im doing everything with the baby including working. I even bring her to my office when I have to go to the office.", "EXACTLY. Im over here struggling while her Mom is just sleeping in. I manage 3 kids + an infant while working full time from home for a large Tech company. It\u2019s stressful. I don\u2019t need anything else on my plate. Taking care of your own children is the least he can do in my opinion. I already manage our two children almost 100% of the time and do everything for and with them. Why should I have the added responsibility of his child too??", "100000% yes. This is exactly the point for me", "My step daughters normal routine is to be dropped off at her Moms on his way to work. Mom then gets her ready and drives her to school. This is not a normal thing for me to be driving both kids to school. \n\nAlso my kids are his kids, but his kids are not my kids. So not really a fair comparison.", "Because there is only a 15 minute drop off between both schools and sitting in school drop off traffic would mean one of them will be late every day", "Because that would be playing right into his masterful scheme all along to have children switch up schools just so OP would have to bear the heavy cross of an extra drop-off a few blocks away! \ud83d\ude44\n\n(i.e., you\u2019re entirely right)", "Yup. Exactly. I feel like some of these people don\u2019t understand the logistical issues of school drop offs in the morning", "Again, as stated in the original post her normal routine is that her Dad drops her off at her Moms in the morning and her Mom gets her ready for school and drops her off. This is not the normal routine for me to be driving her but it seems like that was his plan without communicating that.", "I wouldn\u2019t mind helping but that means one child will always be late", "Yes I understand that but one child would always be late.", "No", "It seems like everyone is missing the point. Its NOT the one week out of the month, its ALL the other days that he didn\u2019t ask about and tried to just spring on me without communicating. The one week out of the month is totally FINE. I can do that. But today he was NOT on call and her mother was home. He failed to mention she was home and I had no idea until her mother called her in the morning to tell her to have a good day. It felt sneaky. It felt like he asked me about 1 week a month, but really had the intention of sticking me with it all the time.", "Exactly. She is not the problem and to me, his comments were deflecting and showing the true intent behind the original agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re already doing it when Im on call, might as well do it all the time!\u201d I felt in that moment if I didn\u2019t set the boundary, he would walk all over it. It\u2019s impossible for him to do ANY of the morning work. He leaves the house at 5 am and gets home at 5 pm even when hes not on call so he is basically incapable of doing the morning routine with just our older son let alone both. When I gave birth to our daughter in October he did the morning routine for two weeks and then was very vocal about how \u201che can\u2019t wait to go back to work!\u201d But yet, Im the unreasonable one for not wanting to add more chaos to my already hectic mornings.", "Obviously I knew about them but wasn\u2019t under the impression that I would have to share equal responsibility for them when her Mom is ready and available.", "Umm again, this is not her normal routine. Normally her Dad takes her to her Mom on his way to work. Her mom gets her ready and takes her to school. I dont get how Im an AH because all of a sudden my husband decided that this is my job without communicating the full intention. Her mother is also home at this time and perfectly capable of getting her ready and taking her. I never said I expected her to pick her up. My husband normally drops her off at her Moms on his way to work.", "Mom works evenings but not overnight. So we have her on the nights Mom works. Mom has her in the morning before school and during the day on breaks and then brings her here on her way to work if no school. Otherwise she is at daycare after school until my husband picks her up after work. This is the schedule we have had for as long as I can remember. Only recently when my son switched schools is when this conversation started, which is why it feels sneaky.", "She would prefer to have her but if hes on call, Im not going to make her come and pick her up before school, thats silly. But Im not going to be driving her over there before school either so we will make do when the time comes.", "We live in the next city over from my step daughter\u2019s mother where my stepdaughter attends school. We did a transfer and tried to get our son into her school but it was full so we were sent to a nearby school. Hes on a transfer and part of that transfer os he cant be habitually tardy and taking her consistently would cause that for both of them.", "It would explain how they both seem to only care about themselves and what\u2019s in their best interest.", "It gives insight into your relationship with your husband. Completely relevant.", "yep! and as I said above, I think folks are being unfair by saying you aren't being a partner by helping him / mothering his kids too. because you are helping him when he's on call. \n\nHe's not being a partner by surreptitiously trying to expand this arrangement when he's NOT ON CALL. You are getting thrown under the bus here. when  he is not on call, it should absolutely be HIM returning daughter to ex wife and then ex wife doing it.", "Does her mother work nights?

Gate\u2019s don\u2019t open until 15 minutes before school starts and then I have to sit in traffic to get to the other school. So I would essentially have to drop one kid off before that gates open and the other after.", "She has a full time job and a baby. It was not her scheduled week to drop off both kids. Her husband can juggle some kid stuff too.", "Thank you. That\u2019s exactly how I feel. And just because I work from home, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not busy.", "That was my suggestion.

You\u2019re only dropping her off when your husband is on call which only happens one week out of the month. You can\u2019t find a way to make this work for five days each month so that your husband can work? It doesn\u2019t make sense for your stepdaughter\u2019s mother to come to your house super early, drive her daughter back to her house to get her ready for school and then drive her to school. That wouldn\u2019t work. If you don\u2019t take her to school, your stepdaughter would probably have to stay at her mother\u2019s house during the weeks your husband is on call and he probably wants to avoid that. Your husband is asking for your help and it\u2019s not an unreasonable request.", "I guess I would be more of a team player if this were a team effort. However Im the only one doing all the work when it comes to this. Its not like the pick/up drop off, daycare, etc is split between us. I\u2019m the only one doing it so it feels like \u201cjust one more thing.\u201d", "Yea still not a good plan\u2026 at all. And this is comes from someone who been there. We used to have to wake up at 3am, get ready, drive the 30mins to my mom. Go to school. My dad would pick us up sometime after work.

What would you do if they were both your children? You'd find a way to make it work. Tons of people do it every morning.", "Of course ! No this would be a slippery slope and you would be expected to do more and more if you agreed. He can gripe all he wants but he made her and she is his child not yours", "No", "Thats what I\u2019m saying- that was the original agreement between us - that I would help when hes on call, I have no issue with that. Today, he was not on call and her mother was home(unbeknownst to me until she called her this morning) and he asked me to take her. I have no problem helping when hes on call. The point is that I feel like he\u2019s trying to switch it up on me and get me to do it all the time rather than him drop her off at her Moms on his way to work, which is their normal routine.", "Ignore them ! You are juggling an 8 month old baby too! It\u2019s a lot of work and your responsibility is to your children not his !", "If they were both my kids they would go to the same school and it would be a non issue.", "A lot of schools are very strict about children being dropped off too early. Some people take it to extremes.", "Exactly and I'm confused. Why is it possible for her to help out one week per month when he is on call and then the other three weeks it's 'too hard/too far apart/one will always be late'\u2014if this is the case, would it not apply every day and four weeks per month? If the grievance is with the dad dumping his duties on her without asking, then okay. But she's not focusing on him but instead complaining it's too hard but magically she is able to do it one week a month. So which is it? It's \"too hard\" or she resents the father not asking her?", "omg\nhow anyone thinks you are self serving when an 8-month-old and a FT job are also involved is just beyond belief.\n\nedit: typo", "Then how do you explain getting pregnant to a man who had an infant with another woman? Just curious.", "I think you are NTA and I think it needs to be clarified that he's hoisting this new arrangement on you OUTSIDE of his on-call week.  if you didn't WFH I would be more likely to say you are  TA and agree with others' points, but yeah he is taking advantage of your willingness to step up during the week when he is on call, and trying to expand it to his non-on-call weeks. \n\n(when you are also balancing an 8month old and a job.) NTA.", "This wasn\u2019t clear in your post so you should probably make an edit. I agree with you that your husband should keep the normal routine when he\u2019s not on call. There\u2019s nothing wrong with setting that boundary. However, her mother has nothing to do with this issue. She was never supposed to come to your house in the morning. Your stepdaughter is supposed to be brought to her. If your husband decides to drop some of his parenting duties in your lap, that\u2019s not her problem and she doesn\u2019t have to fix it for you. This is a marital issue, not a coparenting issue.", "Thank you my thoughts exactly", "I\u2019m sorry, did you completely miss the part where OP says she is also taking care of a baby AND is WFH???? It seems like there is already waaaayyy too much on her plate without her husband shirking his responsibilities and dumping them on her. Just because it\u2019s possible for someone to FORCE themselves to do something in an emergency, doesn\u2019t mean they should HAVE to put themselves through that struggle 24/7, especially since the step kid has 2 parents already and OP has 2 kids in ADDITION to a full time job.", "Five days a month of extra crazy morning and possibly having one kid late is a lot more doable than every single day. Have you ever sat in school drop off lines with a baby and worried about getting to work on time? Then driving to another school and sitting in that line, still with the baby and still freaking out about work? Are you for real?", ".... Its pretty clear that she doesn't mind helping out if it's necessary but that doing it regularly is too much because of the timing of the 2 schools and traffic.", "It\u2019s more the nasty attitude she has towards her husbands children. One of which she\u2019s probably known their entire life.", "They split up and then we got together. They were not married. Simple.", "Thank you, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying", "I never said I expected the Mom to pick her up. \n\nI will help out when hes on call, not a problem. \n\nWhen hes not on call she will be dropped at her moms. \n\nHe is trying to sneak in more without even having a discussion. Her Mom was home today, he was not on call, and her Mom was home. Why was she not brought over to her Mom in the morning? He never told me she was home, just asked me to take her. I assumed she wasn\u2019t available, since that was the agreement, so I said yes. Then Mom calls her in the morning to tell her to have a good day so I realized she was home.", "I'm sorry, did you completely miss the part where she is \\*somehow able to do it\\* and suspend all laws of physics for one week per month? And that if she is overwhelmed and \"the kids will always be late yada yada\" then it should follow that they come up with a different arrangement. If she is too overwhelmed and has a fulltime job then that applies all month. 5 times a month is not an emergency it's a recurring schedule that she should not have agreed to and needs to update if it does not work for her", "Are you for real? Just because it's \"more doable\" doesn't mean it's a good idea. That's like saying \"less robbery is better than all the time!\" How about NONE if it doesn't work? If it's overwhelming AT ALL for a week of every month to the point she resents the kid and has a meltdown about her mom 'secretly being home' maybe......don't do it??", "It's pretty clear to me that she does mind helping out and that's why instead of it being no big deal, she makes a post about how hard it is, how inconvenient it is, how overwhelmed she is, and how angry she was when she found out her step kid's mom was home. 5 times a month is regularly. Someone else mentioned they need a better plan and I agree. Why even do the month if one extra day would put you over the edge? Like I don't see how people keep arguing about how she has too much on her plate but for some reason it's great she's doing this 60 times a year?", "I am not picking up on a nasty attitude toward her step children. Rather, I sense frustration at how this was handled and exhaustion from what she has on her plate (infant, WFH job). Being part of blended family does not mean she should be taken advantage of by hubby during his non-on-call weeks. But hubby is doing that. If he were being fair she wouldn't even be uttering the sentences being perceived as 'nasty'.", "I don\u2019t have a nasty attitude. Im overwhelmed and cannot take on an additional child when Im already overwhelmed and managing 2 kids, breastfeeding full time, a full time job, and extra curricular activities for my older child. If I was a stay at home mom? Sure. But Im not. I have a career and Im working around a breastfeeding and infant the entire day and night.", "That\u2019s your long story? \ud83d\ude02\n\nIdk, but it doesn\u2019t add up. Married or not, your husband getting two women pregnant back to back is questionable behavior, at best. And your attitude towards his children that are not with you reeks of resentment. \n\nI\u2019m guessing you had something to do with why he and his previous partner split.", "There was something with y'all before they broke up though wasn't there? Maybe he didn't cheat with you, but I have a feeling you were a factor in the breakup by the way you're being so evasive", ">Mom calls her in the morning to tell her to have a good day so I realized she was home.\n\nWhat about this makes you think she was home? Did she call from a landline or say she was home? Because there's plenty of options where she could've had a few minutes to call her daughter, but couldn't be at home at the time.", "The whole point of this post is that OP IS trying to update the schedule as much as she can. She seems like a great person who is willing to put up with suffering the struggle in an emergency, but why in God\u2019s name is SHE the one to blame for suffering? WHY is she an AH for struggling, and not being willing to do that 24/7? WHY are you blaming the victim and not the parents who are dumping this responsibility on her? WHY are you shaming her for not completely taking responsibility for 2 kids and a baby every single day 24/7 in addition to her job? Why on earth is there no consideration for the fact that this step kid has 2 parents whose primary responsibility it is to take care of them, and absolutely no credit given to OP for stepping up when necessary? Why is it that OP is in the wrong for not forcing herself to suffer 24/7 instead of being applauded for stepping up when necessary even at great cost to herself? Damn this is a completely insane take imo.", "Nope, wrong again. Like I said it\u2019s irrelevant to the story and frankly none of your business. Know what it reeks like? It reeks like privacy. \nHave you ever been a step parent? Do you even have children? This isn\u2019t the stone age, it is possible for people to have more than one parent of their children. She could be a drug addict, she could have left and come back. She could have been unfaithful. Who knows? You\u2019ll never know because it\u2019s irrelevant to the post. Thanks for the presumptions, though.", "the question to which she answered 'long story' was 'how did your relationship begin?' \n\nshe still hasn't answered that question. so many are presuming it began with an affair, it didn't. OP says theirs ended and then she and him got together.  Your presumption is why her response seems laughable, but that's on you.", "No, there wasn\u2019t. We had known each other since high school but were not romantically involved until like 10 years after high school.", "Because when I asked my husband he said yes she was around.", "Nah you're the victim blamer which is why you're defending a woman who resents taking her stepchild to school because the dad asked her to one day past her 'allotted' schedule which she is able to do admittedly every month 5 times. WHY are you DRAMATICALLY whining about what an overburdened hero and martyr she is for taking a kid to school when she clearly resents it, resents her husband, and the child and cannot communicate her boundaries? It should be crystal clear that anyone having a fit because they have to take the kid to school one day a week more than usual obviously doesn't want to do it in the first place. Your take is insane and enables resentment for a child", "If she's overburdened has a baby she has 2 parents etc etc etc etc ad nauseam then that applies \\*every\\* \\*day\\*. If it's 'great cost to herself' how about not doing it and coming up with a different arrangement like many blended families do every day?"]}
