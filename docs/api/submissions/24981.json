We have 2 children together 8 yo & 8 mo old baby. \nMy husband recently got a promotion which requires him to be on call 1 week out of the month. I work from home and am the primary caregiver for both of our kids.\nOur 8 yo recently switched to a different and better school, which happens to be minutes away from my stepdaughter\u2019s school.

I assumed that nobody was available to take her since he said when nobody was available in our previous conversation. I think it\u2019s important to know that Both the 8 & 9 year olds start school at the same so this is a problem. I said I would try it anyway. But in doing so, it became very hectic trying to get both kids ready at once, feeding them breakfast, getting the baby ready, etc. Ended up leaving 8 minutes later than planned so my step daughter was on time and my son was borderline late/running to class. So I told my husband I couldn\u2019t take her every day and questioned why I had to when her Mom was home. He said I left too late & started saying things like \u201cI didn\u2019t know it would be such a big deal to help me out\u201d & \u201csorry my children are such an inconvenience for you.\u201d Etc. I explained that shes not an inconvenience, but has a perfectly ready and available parent to take her, it was hard getting everyone ready on time, the kids were playing and not getting ready, plus the baby, all of it. I reminded him that when we spoke, he said emergencies and when nobody was available but her Mom called her this morning to tell her to have a good day and where to be picked up so this wasn\u2019t the case today.  I told him his children are his responsibility and he cant get upset when I cant take responsibility for them as well as my own children and that it wasn\u2019t fair to expect that. \n\nI cant help but wondering if this was his plan all along- to move my son schools and then assign me to carpool without even communicating- especially since he doubled down and was saying his kids were an inconvenience and trying to guilt me. If the situation had been fully communicated, I would have said no. My schedule is crazy enough trying to manage the house, my job, and an 8 month old while working. \nHowever, I cant help feeling like an asshole. If they we\u2019re being dropped off at the same school, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Our son was late, and it was just too much. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA??", "created_utc": 1692406997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15v21lp/aita_for_not_wanting_to_drive_my_stepdaughter_to/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Could you make all this work? Sure. But that isn't what this is about. It is about the principle of the matter. Your husband wasn't up front with his intentions at all, and I think he is likely happy to not have the extra fuss of taking his daughter to her mom's house every morning so mom can handle getting her ready and dropping her off at school (and I'm sure mom is happy not to have to bother too). Emergencies and on call are one thing, but this is obviously not what is happening. I think you need to take a hard stance on this before it just becomes expected that you are going to do it every day. I think that every time he asks you to take her, you need to ask him if it is an emergency and if he says yes, refuse to commit until he tells you what the emergency is or what the circumstances are that keep him/the mom from being able to do it. Press him for that info, and don't back down and don't do it if his answer is not acceptable. NTA, OP, and good luck!", "INFO: how did your relationship begin? He has a child with someone else that\u2019s only a year older than the child you have with him?", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA.

Husband doesn't help *AT ALL* in the morning routines, so he doesn't get to add a kid into the mix.  Daughter can stick with her regular routine of her *dad and mom* parenting her.", "i can't believe people are saying you are TA given that you have an 8-month-old and a FT job.  and yea school traffic sucks. \n\nsounds like it's not a favor to him as much as it helping out the ex too. what is she doing while you are managing chaos?", "NTA. Reddit just likes to poop on step-parents who aren't constantly bending over backwards. It's easier for her mum to drop her off, it's part of their routine, she gets time with her mum in the morning and everyone is on time. This arrangement is fine, what reason would your husband have for wanting to change it?", "ESH - You are not playing as team members of the same team. Including your step daughter into your daily routine is not a significant \"hardship\".\n\nHe should had told you that from the start. And you would had been TA if you had said \"no\".\n\nOtherwise, what you are saying is that you don't feel responsible for his kids, and he shouldn't  feel responsible for yours.\n\nWhich sounds crazy.", "why dont u just drop one off earlier than the other lol i dont get it", "Some of the comments here are wild. OP is NTA. She is being super helpful by taking her stepdaughter into school when he is on call. It is not her responsibility to drop her stepchild off at school when he isn't on call. Do people not remember how insane it is to take care of an 8 month old while getting older kids to and from school/events? One blowout diaper can put the entire morning out of sync. If your husband asks you to take your stepchild in and he isn't on call, I would suggest that he drop the two older kids off instead. Leaving you to breastfeed in peace and get ready for your work day.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband, stepdaughter, and stepdaughter's mother have a dropoff routine that does not involve you except for when he's on call one week each month. You help out when he's on call and make things work.\n\nHe tried to switch it up and get you start taking core of dropoffs even when he's not on call. Surprising you with that at the last minute was a dirty trick. Not being honest about her mom being available to do the dropoff as usual was an overt lie of omission.\n\nHe seems very not trustworthy IMO.", "NTA. You can't just drop a child off extra early for school. There's a pretty narrow and inflexible window. If there isn't enough time to get to one school, deal with traffic in the drop-off line, get to the other school, and deal with traffic in the other drop-off line, one kid is going to be tardy. If it happens more than on a very rare occasion, that's going to cause problems with truancy laws (at least it would in my state). \n\nIn an emergency, that's ok - and it sounds like what you agreed to. But it sounds like your husband has decided he doesn't want to take the time to leave for work however much earlier he has to every day in order to take his daughter to her mother's house, even if she's available.", "What is the alternative?  Do you expect your husband to do drop off for his daughter or her mother to come all the way to your home to get her and take her to school?  If so Yta.  You are going that way, it seems logical to take both kids. Now it\u2019s fair to ask for help to get everyone ready in the morning but expecting your husband to drive separately when you are going that way is petty.", "YTA. You married a man with children, when they are in your home during his parenting time you are part of the parenting team. Both children are old enough to get themselves ready, if it is so difficult to make breakfast for one extra child, then start a little earlier so you can get out the door in time to drop them both off.", "[deleted]", "There\u2019s not a bus?", "More Info Needed:\n\nOP, that week of the month, why doesn't the mom pick her daughter up on her way home from work? Then she can take her kid home, get her ready and off to school?\n\nOr, have you considered renting a stop on a private school bus? Many people in your position pay a fee for pickups. Schedule it for before you leave with your child, and she can ride the bus to school. If it's only one week a month, it should not be a big deal or even too expensive.", "NTA about being upset about the struggle. Mornings can be hectic. I wonder how things would play out if you had commitments a few times that prevented you from getting them ready and dropped off at school and your husband did the carpooling and corralling a few mornings each month. I'm sure you'll find a reasonable routine after a dozen first hand experiences on how crazy it gets. That being said, YWBTA if you treated your stepdaughter like a chore and a problem. The problem isn't her or who's responsibility because she came with the package and is now part of your family. The problem is lack of teamwork and communication. Hopefully, with a little perspective y'all can work something fair and equal out. Good luck.", "YTA - when you married him you knew he had children and that they would also become your children\u2026 right? Or did he keep the kids a secret until after you were married?", "YTA- leave earlier and get over it. It amazes me when I hear someone who has step kids act like they have no responsibility for them. You are expecting their mom to come all the way over and pick her up and take her to school because it was\u2026stressful? Parenting is stressful. Plan your day/ morning better, you have 4 kids, not two. Drop one of the kids off a little early and get the others there on time. Put on your big girl panties and be a responsible mom.", "Nta", "INFO: How far away are these schools from your house?", "INFO: Does your husband have primary custody of your stepdaughter? is that why he drops her off to her mom every morning?", "INFO - what does the mother think about this?  I didn\u2019t see you mention how many days a week step daughter stays at your house, but if it\u2019s all weekdays, I\u2019d imagine the mother likes the little bit of extra time she gets with her. You two should ~~double team him~~ team up and take him down.", "Why aren\u2019t both kids going to the same school?", "You need to let him know that you see through him, that way he'll stop.\n\n\"You are trying to get me to take her every day. You ain't slick. You thought you could work up to making me do all of it. It's not happening. I only take over for you when you're on call, and even that is very hard on me.

I'm not here to do everything for you and you won't use me.\"\n\nNTA", "Your schedule is overwhelming, and I'm just reading it. I'm sorry OP.\n\n\nFor both kids, I'm confused - is there no school bus?  Or could you all create a carpool system with other parents in the neighborhood?  \n\n\nThis said, the way your husband is acting is NOT great. I get the vibe that he wants you to be the full-time parent and perhaps quit your job.  \n\n\nIf the baby isn't in daycare yet, pls put them in daycare. You need a break.\n\n\nNTA", "INFO: I saw this elsewhere on reddit - given that your husband thinks it's no problem to get both kids ready plus baby, just say, 'ok husband, can you show me how it's done?  I'll take notes.'  \n\n\nLet him show you how to get 3 kids ready plus yourself and get them to school.  And if he refuses, his refusal tells me that he knows he's asking the impossible of you. And doesn't care.  \n\n\nThat's not a healthy partner. This isn't a healthy marriage.", "Finally, someone who gets it. I don\u2019t mind helping out, totally not that. But this isn\u2019t her normal routine or mine and its really the sneakiness of the communication that bothers me. It feels like his intentions were to slowly build up and get me to eventually do it all the time without communicating that.", "thank you! agree!", "I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not the only one wondering about that math.", "Yeah, I'm kind of stuck on that. Very relevant. Affair partner/affair baby is my guess.", "Yep. Long story but irrelevant to this post.", "That\u2019s exactly my point. I feel like some of these people leaving hateful comments either dont have kids, haven\u2019t worked from home, haven\u2019t worked around an infant or sat in school traffic. Or all of the above. THANK YOU.", "No, I do it all. He starts work at 6 am when not on call and gets home at 5 pm. Im doing everything with the baby including working. I even bring her to my office when I have to go to the office.", "EXACTLY. Im over here struggling while her Mom is just sleeping in. I manage 3 kids + an infant while working full time from home for a large Tech company. It\u2019s stressful. I don\u2019t need anything else on my plate. Taking care of your own children is the least he can do in my opinion. I already manage our two children almost 100% of the time and do everything for and with them. Why should I have the added responsibility of his child too??", "100000% yes. This is exactly the point for me", "My step daughters normal routine is to be dropped off at her Moms on his way to work. Mom then gets her ready and drives her to school. This is not a normal thing for me to be driving both kids to school. \n\nAlso my kids are his kids, but his kids are not my kids. So not really a fair comparison.", "Because there is only a 15 minute drop off between both schools and sitting in school drop off traffic would mean one of them will be late every day", "Because that would be playing right into his masterful scheme all along to have children switch up schools just so OP would have to bear the heavy cross of an extra drop-off a few blocks away! \ud83d\ude44\n\n(i.e., you\u2019re entirely right)", "Yup. Exactly. I feel like some of these people don\u2019t understand the logistical issues of school drop offs in the morning", "Again, as stated in the original post her normal routine is that her Dad drops her off at her Moms in the morning and her Mom gets her ready for school and drops her off. This is not the normal routine for me to be driving her but it seems like that was his plan without communicating that.", "I wouldn\u2019t mind helping but that means one child will always be late", "Yes I understand that but one child would always be late.", "No", "It seems like everyone is missing the point. Its NOT the one week out of the month, its ALL the other days that he didn\u2019t ask about and tried to just spring on me without communicating. The one week out of the month is totally FINE. I can do that. But today he was NOT on call and her mother was home. He failed to mention she was home and I had no idea until her mother called her in the morning to tell her to have a good day. It felt sneaky. It felt like he asked me about 1 week a month, but really had the intention of sticking me with it all the time.", "Exactly. She is not the problem and to me, his comments were deflecting and showing the true intent behind the original agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re already doing it when Im on call, might as well do it all the time!\u201d I felt in that moment if I didn\u2019t set the boundary, he would walk all over it. It\u2019s impossible for him to do ANY of the morning work. He leaves the house at 5 am and gets home at 5 pm even when hes not on call so he is basically incapable of doing the morning routine with just our older son let alone both. When I gave birth to our daughter in October he did the morning routine for two weeks and then was very vocal about how \u201che can\u2019t wait to go back to work!\u201d But yet, Im the unreasonable one for not wanting to add more chaos to my already hectic mornings.", "Obviously I knew about them but wasn\u2019t under the impression that I would have to share equal responsibility for them when her Mom is ready and available.", "Umm again, this is not her normal routine. Normally her Dad takes her to her Mom on his way to work. Her mom gets her ready and takes her to school. I dont get how Im an AH because all of a sudden my husband decided that this is my job without communicating the full intention. Her mother is also home at this time and perfectly capable of getting her ready and taking her. I never said I expected her to pick her up. My husband normally drops her off at her Moms on his way to work.", "Mom works evenings but not overnight. So we have her on the nights Mom works. Mom has her in the morning before school and during the day on breaks and then brings her here on her way to work if no school. Otherwise she is at daycare after school until my husband picks her up after work. This is the schedule we have had for as long as I can remember. Only recently when my son switched schools is when this conversation started, which is why it feels sneaky.", "She would prefer to have her but if hes on call, Im not going to make her come and pick her up before school, thats silly. But Im not going to be driving her over there before school either so we will make do when the time comes.", "We live in the next city over from my step daughter\u2019s mother where my stepdaughter attends school. We did a transfer and tried to get our son into her school but it was full so we were sent to a nearby school.

He can gripe all he wants but he made her and she is his child not yours", "No", "Thats what I\u2019m saying- that was the original agreement between us - that I would help when hes on call, I have no issue with that. Today, he was not on call and her mother was home(unbeknownst to me until she called her this morning) and he asked me to take her. I have no problem helping when hes on call.

NTA.", "This wasn\u2019t clear in your post so you should probably make an edit. I agree with you that your husband should keep the normal routine when he\u2019s not on call. There\u2019s nothing wrong with setting that boundary. However, her mother has nothing to do with this issue. She was never supposed to come to your house in the morning. Your stepdaughter is supposed to be brought to her. If your husband decides to drop some of his parenting duties in your lap, that\u2019s not her problem and she doesn\u2019t have to fix it for you.

It sounds like you and your husband need to sit down with his ex girlfriend and discuss living arrangements and carpool.It\u2019s not fair to that little girl to get treated like that", "He\u2019s creating an insanely burdensome situation for his wife on zero communication with his wife and his own child with her. He isn\u2019t considering the emotional and educational impact this actually has on his child, either. Kinda fucking gross you think she should just lay down and be a doormat. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a necessary, unavoidable change. The step-kid\u2019s mother needs to be the one handling her child. Being an adult means you don\u2019t arbitrarily decide to dump your ex\u2019s motherly duties onto your current wife.", "Actually, you can't just drop off a child sooner than a specific time in the morning - there won't be any staff yet on the clock to be responsible for them after the parent leaves. Many schools will not even unlock the doors before that precise time, so if you live in a cold climate the kid will be freezing in just a few minutes. (I'm not a teacher but worked in a school system for over 15 years, so I know this was actually a serious ongoing issue in many schools. Many parents had to get to work/other kids' schools after, but teachers and staff didn't want to come in every day for time they weren't being paid for, etc.)", "Im confused as to why she should have to help on his days? Look, I have an ex and I wouldnt run to his house to take my kid to school on his days, thats enabling him to be irresponsible.", "With your husband being the way he is,  would it not be easier to request that if the child is not taken at her mom's at that ridiculous time, her mom  pick up the kid and take her straight to school from your house? There's no reason the kids can't get dressed and ready on their own in a timely manner. That's an age appropriate skill for both kids.", "Have you raised 2 kids close in age? I would think not judging by your statement. Yes they can do all that and get ready. They are very self sufficient for their age but they play and talk and mess around and its not in a timely manner. Its like herding cats.", "I have taken care of siblings less than a year apart for years. I also have provided child care for  relatives  with kids close in age that are younger than yours. My friend has a set of twins and 2 younger siblings and works full time outside the home. I take them to school on occasion. I volunteer at an elementary school. I know it can be done. I've seen it be done.  I've done it myself. From what you're saying, the majority of kids with siblings close in age at the school I help out at wouldn't be able to get to school on time, but they do. Some of these parents have 2-3 different schools to get to with the same start time. \n\nAnyways,  my suggestion was just an idea to help you out so you didn't have to go to 2 schools.", "I honestly just feel sorry for the kid, who has to get up at 4:30/5 AM to be shuffled around, whike half-sibling gets to stay in bed. I'm not saying this is necessarily on OP, but has anyone asked the kid how they feel?", "YTA. You are married, so that means his kids are now your kids, too. \n\nI know it isn't easy, especially with a young baby, but that's the reality of the situation. \n\nYou shouldn't say 'your kids' you should say 'our kids'", "INFO:\n\nWhy are you getting an 8 and 9 year old ready for school? Assuming they don\u2019t have any disabilities, they\u2019re capable of making their own breakfast, getting dressed, and doing their own hygiene. \n\nIf you do need to keep a close eye on them, why can\u2019t the 17 year old get the baby ready? Or she be the one that makes breakfast?", "YTA. It was the first day. Nothing goes right the first time. Plan better the night before and try again before giving up. You sound like a high schooler with how quickly you stopped trying.", "NTA\nYou need to have a heart to heart conversation with your husband. Why is he pressuring you and not supporting you? It could be a stupid course of thoughts for him but it would be nice to get to the bottom of this so you can set him straight.", "INFO \nWouldn\u2019t you have to drop her off at her mom\u2019s though? Who would watch your kids while you were doing that?", "Forgive me if I missed this, but what if the Mom came to your place to pick up her daughter to take her to school that 1 week out of the month? Everyone gets to school on time, and the mother gets to be with her daughter for a bit that week as well. Maybe it is a bit more driving for her, but it takes some off your plate and puts it on the mothers otherwise empty plate that week...", "NTA. Why is your husband not helping out in the mornings if he expects you to drive them. He said you left too late, and then put this bullshit \"I'm sorry my children\" accusation? He sounds like a manipulative jerk. If he was home, he should have kept the baby with him while you were doing all the running around.", "I would negotiate for what suits you.\n\nIf both can be dropped off on the same run easily, why doesn't hubby/other mum do it?\n\nNot all the time, but you can take both kids some mornings and each of them can take both kids some mornings. Have yourself a few very easy mornings with no drop offs.", "Info how did your relationship start?", "NTA\n\n>But in doing so, it became very hectic trying to get both kids ready at once, feeding them breakfast, getting the baby ready, etc. Ended up leaving 8 minutes later than planned so my step daughter was on time and my son was borderline late/running to class\n\nThat sounds incredible stressful. And if you were a single mom of 3, you\u2019d have to find a way to deal with it.  But you\u2019re not. There are literally TWO OTHER PARENTS in the picture.  Why does it all have to fall on your head?  If you deal with two of them in the morning, it\u2019s only the other two parents deal with the third.", "Always drop your son off first so he isn't late", "I don't know, dropping SD to her mother during his father custody days is quite weird. Arranging transportation is the father responsibility", "This is the kind of thing my amazing stepmom would\u2019ve done for my mom. \n\nIn a way she did! My mom\u2019s work hours shifted an hour earlier, meaning there was absolutely no way to get me to my Jazz Band Club at 7:30am when she needed to be clocked in. I\u2019d been in JBC for around 4yrs at that point. Stepmom drove 30min to pick me up, drive another 30min further to drop me off and an hour to drive back to go to work. Every Thursday for almost a year until I got my license and could drive myself during the end of my junior yr.\n\nCrazy how you think I should\u2019ve been forced to drop JBC as someone who was pursuing a career as a musician.", "The other mom should not get her son. OP has stated that she is only responsible for her kids and that his kids are not her kids so why should the other mom carpool them? You can\u2019t expect things to work as a blended family if OP doesn\u2019t even look at her stepchild as one of her own", "Which includes the time to drop off the one, and deal with traffic to drop off the second. So add another ~30min to the ~15min. That\u2019s just one way. Overall, it\u2019s likely pushing the hell out of a ~1hr round trip commute.", "She doesn't say that. She does feel responsible but as a stepparent you cannot just say: I married your daddy so you will have to listen to me now also, call me mommy and love me thesame, now do your homework!\nNope! It's a delicate situation and you have to accept that they do not love you in the beginning, just to be nice to eachother has to be enough. For fun stuff you are there and try to be an ally, but for parenting stuff you have to let that stay with the parents that were already there, and not overstep.", "It wasn't the first day.", "Ahhhhh yes. The classic assumption of \u201cjust buy a car, then find the time and money to get your 17yo their permit which requires the supplemental time and money *teaching* that child how to drive and educate them well so they can go and pass their driving test, which could ALSO include requiring driver\u2019s ed depending on where one lives.\n\nI know OP stated the 17yo isn\u2019t an issue, but ffs please stop the assumption that people can afford this. Especially in 2023.", "Why would it be your guess though? Couples with newborns \nseparate. Couples separate during pregnancies.", "It has absolutely nothing to do with OP's described situation, just a side judgment y'all want to pass.", "Maybe not so much planned intentionally but willing to take advantage now that it has happened", "Um, while I agree you're NTA, I have 2 questions for you. \n\n\n1 where was your husband while you were struggling and why wasn't he helping\n\n2 I have 3 kids, 10,7 & almost 2, I have been where you are and I am wondering what your morning routine is. You said they were playing, why were you letting them play before they were ready to go. Some nights I prepare my kids school lunches the night before so that all I need to do is pack the cold stuff in to the lunch boxes in the morning. sometimes, I'm too exhausted at night and just do it all in the morning after I have made their breakfast.\n\nMy point is, with planning and preparation, it is possible to do the school run with multiple kids.\n\nI am also wondering why if changing the schools anyway did you not plan ahead and put them both in the same school (if it's gifted or gendered than that's understandable).\n\nI'm sorry if you have already answered these but I couldn't see any in the comments.", "I have only 1 kid to get ready for school and school is a 2 mn walk from my door and I still find it tiring. Kids are so creative when it comes to finding ways to be late lol. 4 kids to handle and drive to different schools sounds like something that would happen to me in a fever induced nightmare.", "Oh, reddit aita hates stepmoms no matter what they do. You should ask for advice on r/stepparents. At least they know what it's like to be stepparent.", "Honestly, maybe you need more childcare. Between the 3 adult job situations, there isn't enough bandwidth to get the kids ready each morning comfortably.\n\nYour husband hasn't been fair dropping this on you but it's time to step outside the box, look at the big picture and work to get a solution that works for everyone.\n\nHubby & other mom not doing their share doesn't mean you have to do it. Leave out the framing of \"not my daughter, not my problem\" and focus on what needs to get done and what you can get done.\n\nMaybe you find someone who comes in and takes the 8 month old off your hands in the morning while you double drop (+ a few hours so you can work)\n\nMaybe you do a double drop some days and other mom does the double drop others.\n\nMaybe you just push back and tell husband to work out an arrangement for both kid school drops that doesn't involve you.", "For real! Ya\u2019ll\u2026every morning:\n\nMy stepdaughter\u2019s biomom drives her daughter to my house and drops her off before school (we live 20 min away), then drives her own stepdaughter to get to a different elementary school, then drives another of her stepdaughters to a middle school that\u2019s 20 minutes farther. That\u2019s A LOT!!!!\n\nThen I proceed drive my stepdaughter to elementary school from our house.\n\nShe picks up her step kids and bio daughter from school.
