We have 2 children together 8 yo & 8 mo old baby. \nMy husband recently got a promotion which requires him to be on call 1 week out of the month. I work from home and am the primary caregiver for both of our kids.\nOur 8 yo recently switched to a different and better school, which happens to be minutes away from my stepdaughter\u2019s school. Upon switching he asked if I could now take his daughter to school when he is on call and I agreed. Normally, she is dropped off with her mother very early in the morning and her mother handles the drop off, daycare, etc. \nIm very inclusive with 4 kids when it comes to parties, Christmas, birthdays, etc. I cook and clean for them but leave homework, showers, discipline, etc to my husband as I don\u2019t feel this is my place.\nToday is the 4th day of school and my husband asked if I could take his daughter to school. I assumed that nobody was available to take her since he said when nobody was available in our previous conversation. I think it\u2019s important to know that Both the 8 & 9 year olds start school at the same so this is a problem. I said I would try it anyway. But in doing so, it became very hectic trying to get both kids ready at once, feeding them breakfast, getting the baby ready, etc. Ended up leaving 8 minutes later than planned so my step daughter was on time and my son was borderline late/running to class. So I told my husband I couldn\u2019t take her every day and questioned why I had to when her Mom was home. He said I left too late & started saying things like \u201cI didn\u2019t know it would be such a big deal to help me out\u201d & \u201csorry my children are such an inconvenience for you.\u201d Etc. I explained that shes not an inconvenience, but has a perfectly ready and available parent to take her, it was hard getting everyone ready on time, the kids were playing and not getting ready, plus the baby, all of it. I reminded him that when we spoke, he said emergencies and when nobody was available but her Mom called her this morning to tell her to have a good day and where to be picked up so this wasn\u2019t the case today.  I told him his children are his responsibility and he cant get upset when I cant take responsibility for them as well as my own children and that it wasn\u2019t fair to expect that. \n\nI cant help but wondering if this was his plan all along- to move my son schools and then assign me to carpool without even communicating- especially since he doubled down and was saying his kids were an inconvenience and trying to guilt me. If the situation had been fully communicated, I would have said no. My schedule is crazy enough trying to manage the house, my job, and an 8 month old while working. \nHowever, I cant help feeling like an asshole. If they we\u2019re being dropped off at the same school, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Our son was late, and it was just too much. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA??", "created_utc": 1692406997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15v21lp/aita_for_not_wanting_to_drive_my_stepdaughter_to/", "score": 602, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Could you make all this work? Sure. But that isn't what this is about. It is about the principle of the matter. Your husband wasn't up front with his intentions at all, and I think he is likely happy to not have the extra fuss of taking his daughter to her mom's house every morning so mom can handle getting her ready and dropping her off at school (and I'm sure mom is happy not to have to bother too). Emergencies and on call are one thing, but this is obviously not what is happening. I think you need to take a hard stance on this before it just becomes expected that you are going to do it every day. I think that every time he asks you to take her, you need to ask him if it is an emergency and if he says yes, refuse to commit until he tells you what the emergency is or what the circumstances are that keep him/the mom from being able to do it. Press him for that info, and don't back down and don't do it if his answer is not acceptable. NTA, OP, and good luck!", "INFO: how did your relationship begin? He has a child with someone else that\u2019s only a year older than the child you have with him?", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA.

Husband doesn't help *AT ALL* in the morning routines, so he doesn't get to add a kid into the mix.  Daughter can stick with her regular routine of her *dad and mom* parenting her.", "i can't believe people are saying you are TA given that you have an 8-month-old and a FT job.  and yea school traffic sucks. \n\nsounds like it's not a favor to him as much as it helping out the ex too. what is she doing while you are managing chaos?", "NTA. Reddit just likes to poop on step-parents who aren't constantly bending over backwards. It's easier for her mum to drop her off, it's part of their routine, she gets time with her mum in the morning and everyone is on time. This arrangement is fine, what reason would your husband have for wanting to change it?", "ESH - You are not playing as team members of the same team. Including your step daughter into your daily routine is not a significant \"hardship\".\n\nHe should had told you that from the start. And you would had been TA if you had said \"no\".\n\nOtherwise, what you are saying is that you don't feel responsible for his kids, and he shouldn't  feel responsible for yours.\n\nWhich sounds crazy.", "why dont u just drop one off earlier than the other lol i dont get it", "Some of the comments here are wild. OP is NTA. She is being super helpful by taking her stepdaughter into school when he is on call. It is not her responsibility to drop her stepchild off at school when he isn't on call. Do people not remember how insane it is to take care of an 8 month old while getting older kids to and from school/events? One blowout diaper can put the entire morning out of sync. If your husband asks you to take your stepchild in and he isn't on call, I would suggest that he drop the two older kids off instead. Leaving you to breastfeed in peace and get ready for your work day.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband, stepdaughter, and stepdaughter's mother have a dropoff routine that does not involve you except for when he's on call one week each month. You help out when he's on call and make things work.\n\nHe tried to switch it up and get you start taking core of dropoffs even when he's not on call. Surprising you with that at the last minute was a dirty trick. Not being honest about her mom being available to do the dropoff as usual was an overt lie of omission.\n\nHe seems very not trustworthy IMO.", "NTA. You can't just drop a child off extra early for school. There's a pretty narrow and inflexible window. If there isn't enough time to get to one school, deal with traffic in the drop-off line, get to the other school, and deal with traffic in the other drop-off line, one kid is going to be tardy. If it happens more than on a very rare occasion, that's going to cause problems with truancy laws (at least it would in my state). \n\nIn an emergency, that's ok - and it sounds like what you agreed to. But it sounds like your husband has decided he doesn't want to take the time to leave for work however much earlier he has to every day in order to take his daughter to her mother's house, even if she's available.", "What is the alternative?  Do you expect your husband to do drop off for his daughter or her mother to come all the way to your home to get her and take her to school?  If so Yta.  You are going that way, it seems logical to take both kids. Now it\u2019s fair to ask for help to get everyone ready in the morning but expecting your husband to drive separately when you are going that way is petty.", "YTA. You married a man with children, when they are in your home during his parenting time you are part of the parenting team. Both children are old enough to get themselves ready, if it is so difficult to make breakfast for one extra child, then start a little earlier so you can get out the door in time to drop them both off.", "[deleted]", "There\u2019s not a bus?", "More Info Needed:\n\nOP, that week of the month, why doesn't the mom pick her daughter up on her way home from work? Then she can take her kid home, get her ready and off to school?\n\nOr, have you considered renting a stop on a private school bus? Many people in your position pay a fee for pickups. Schedule it for before you leave with your child, and she can ride the bus to school. If it's only one week a month, it should not be a big deal or even too expensive.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "YTA- leave earlier and get over it. It amazes me when I hear someone who has step kids act like they have no responsibility for them. You are expecting their mom to come all the way over and pick her up and take her to school because it was\u2026stressful? Parenting is stressful. Plan your day/ morning better, you have 4 kids, not two. Drop one of the kids off a little early and get the others there on time. Put on your big girl panties and be a responsible mom.", "Nta", "INFO: How far away are these schools from your house?", "INFO: Does your husband have primary custody of your stepdaughter? is that why he drops her off to her mom every morning?", "INFO - what does the mother think about this?  I didn\u2019t see you mention how many days a week step daughter stays at your house, but if it\u2019s all weekdays, I\u2019d imagine the mother likes the little bit of extra time she gets with her. You two should ~~double team him~~ team up and take him down.", "Why aren\u2019t both kids going to the same school?", "You need to let him know that you see through him, that way he'll stop.\n\n\"You are trying to get me to take her every day. You ain't slick. You thought you could work up to making me do all of it. It's not happening. I only take over for you when you're on call, and even that is very hard on me.

I'm not here to do everything for you and you won't use me.\"\n\nNTA", "Your schedule is overwhelming, and I'm just reading it. I'm sorry OP.\n\n\nFor both kids, I'm confused - is there no school bus?  Or could you all create a carpool system with other parents in the neighborhood?  \n\n\nThis said, the way your husband is acting is NOT great. I get the vibe that he wants you to be the full-time parent and perhaps quit your job.  \n\n\nIf the baby isn't in daycare yet, pls put them in daycare. You need a break.\n\n\nNTA", "INFO: I saw this elsewhere on reddit - given that your husband thinks it's no problem to get both kids ready plus baby, just say, 'ok husband, can you show me how it's done?  I'll take notes.'  \n\n\nLet him show you how to get 3 kids ready plus yourself and get them to school.  And if he refuses, his refusal tells me that he knows he's asking the impossible of you. And doesn't care.  \n\n\nThat's not a healthy partner. This isn't a healthy marriage.", "Finally, someone who gets it. I don\u2019t mind helping out, totally not that. But this isn\u2019t her normal routine or mine and its really the sneakiness of the communication that bothers me.

Very relevant. Affair partner/affair baby is my guess.", "Yep. Long story but irrelevant to this post.", "That\u2019s exactly my point. I feel like some of these people leaving hateful comments either dont have kids, haven\u2019t worked from home, haven\u2019t worked around an infant or sat in school traffic. Or all of the above. THANK YOU.", "No, I do it all. He starts work at 6 am when not on call and gets home at 5 pm. Im doing everything with the baby including working. I even bring her to my office when I have to go to the office.", "EXACTLY. Im over here struggling while her Mom is just sleeping in. I manage 3 kids + an infant while working full time from home for a large Tech company. It\u2019s stressful. I don\u2019t need anything else on my plate. Taking care of your own children is the least he can do in my opinion. I already manage our two children almost 100% of the time and do everything for and with them. Why should I have the added responsibility of his child too??", "100000% yes. This is exactly the point for me", "My step daughters normal routine is to be dropped off at her Moms on his way to work. Mom then gets her ready and drives her to school. This is not a normal thing for me to be driving both kids to school. \n\nAlso my kids are his kids, but his kids are not my kids. So not really a fair comparison.", "Because there is only a 15 minute drop off between both schools and sitting in school drop off traffic would mean one of them will be late every day", "Because that would be playing right into his masterful scheme all along to have children switch up schools just so OP would have to bear the heavy cross of an extra drop-off a few blocks away! \ud83d\ude44\n\n(i.e., you\u2019re entirely right)", "Yup. Exactly. I feel like some of these people don\u2019t understand the logistical issues of school drop offs in the morning", "Again, as stated in the original post her normal routine is that her Dad drops her off at her Moms in the morning and her Mom gets her ready for school and drops her off. This is not the normal routine for me to be driving her but it seems like that was his plan without communicating that.", "I wouldn\u2019t mind helping but that means one child will always be late", "Yes I understand that but one child would always be late.", "No", "It seems like everyone is missing the point. Its NOT the one week out of the month, its ALL the other days that he didn\u2019t ask about and tried to just spring on me without communicating. The one week out of the month is totally FINE. I can do that. But today he was NOT on call and her mother was home. He failed to mention she was home and I had no idea until her mother called her in the morning to tell her to have a good day. It felt sneaky. It felt like he asked me about 1 week a month, but really had the intention of sticking me with it all the time.", "Exactly. She is not the problem and to me, his comments were deflecting and showing the true intent behind the original agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re already doing it when Im on call, might as well do it all the time!\u201d I felt in that moment if I didn\u2019t set the boundary, he would walk all over it. It\u2019s impossible for him to do ANY of the morning work. He leaves the house at 5 am and gets home at 5 pm even when hes not on call so he is basically incapable of doing the morning routine with just our older son let alone both. When I gave birth to our daughter in October he did the morning routine for two weeks and then was very vocal about how \u201che can\u2019t wait to go back to work!\u201d But yet, Im the unreasonable one for not wanting to add more chaos to my already hectic mornings.", "Obviously I knew about them but wasn\u2019t under the impression that I would have to share equal responsibility for them when her Mom is ready and available.", "Umm again, this is not her normal routine. Normally her Dad takes her to her Mom on his way to work. Her mom gets her ready and takes her to school. I dont get how Im an AH because all of a sudden my husband decided that this is my job without communicating the full intention. Her mother is also home at this time and perfectly capable of getting her ready and taking her. I never said I expected her to pick her up. My husband normally drops her off at her Moms on his way to work.", "Mom works evenings but not overnight. So we have her on the nights Mom works. Mom has her in the morning before school and during the day on breaks and then brings her here on her way to work if no school. Otherwise she is at daycare after school until my husband picks her up after work. This is the schedule we have had for as long as I can remember. Only recently when my son switched schools is when this conversation started, which is why it feels sneaky.", "She would prefer to have her but if hes on call, Im not going to make her come and pick her up before school, thats silly. But Im not going to be driving her over there before school either so we will make do when the time comes.", "We live in the next city over from my step daughter\u2019s mother where my stepdaughter attends school. We did a transfer and tried to get our son into her school but it was full so we were sent to a nearby school. Hes on a transfer and part of that transfer os he cant be habitually tardy and taking her consistently would cause that for both of them.", "It would explain how they both seem to only care about themselves and what\u2019s in their best interest.", "It gives insight into your relationship with your husband. Completely relevant.", "yep! and as I said above, I think folks are being unfair by saying you aren't being a partner by helping him / mothering his kids too. because you are helping him when he's on call. \n\nHe's not being a partner by surreptitiously trying to expand this arrangement when he's NOT ON CALL. You are getting thrown under the bus here. when  he is not on call, it should absolutely be HIM returning daughter to ex wife and then ex wife doing it.", "Does her mother work nights? Forgive me if you explained, but I\u2019m not understanding the morning routine.\n\nAnd NTA, your partner tried to pull a fast one.", "\"Also my kids are his kids, but his kids are not my kids.\"\n\nDoes your step daughters treat you like a mother? Do they live in your house? Share your meals? Play with your kids? IF they part of your family, then your statment becomes quite strange.\n\nBut, again, i have passed my judgment.

What time is stepdaughter being woken up to so she can get to school on time?", "If you learn to manage your time and schedule, neither one of them will be late.", "I think people are waiting to jump on you because your child and his youngest child are so close in age .

Gate\u2019s don\u2019t open until 15 minutes before school starts and then I have to sit in traffic to get to the other school. So I would essentially have to drop one kid off before that gates open and the other after.", "She has a full time job and a baby. It was not her scheduled week to drop off both kids. Her husband can juggle some kid stuff too.", "Thank you. That\u2019s exactly how I feel. And just because I work from home, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not busy.", "That was my suggestion.

He can gripe all he wants but he made her and she is his child not yours", "No", "Thats what I\u2019m saying- that was the original agreement between us - that I would help when hes on call, I have no issue with that. Today, he was not on call and her mother was home(unbeknownst to me until she called her this morning) and he asked me to take her. I have no problem helping when hes on call.

NTA.", "This wasn\u2019t clear in your post so you should probably make an edit. I agree with you that your husband should keep the normal routine when he\u2019s not on call. There\u2019s nothing wrong with setting that boundary. However, her mother has nothing to do with this issue. She was never supposed to come to your house in the morning. Your stepdaughter is supposed to be brought to her. If your husband decides to drop some of his parenting duties in your lap, that\u2019s not her problem and she doesn\u2019t have to fix it for you.

Just because it\u2019s possible for someone to FORCE themselves to do something in an emergency, doesn\u2019t mean they should HAVE to put themselves through that struggle 24/7, especially since the step kid has 2 parents already and OP has 2 kids in ADDITION to a full time job.", "Five days a month of extra crazy morning and possibly having one kid late is a lot more doable than every single day.

The fact that I don't see our neighborhood bus until anywhere from 5:30 - 6:30 is a big one. We do sports and that just doesn't work for us. Not to mention the name calling and bullying that goes on that the drivers have little control over. Also there was a kid a couple days ago whose bus left before they got out of class (not sure how that even happens if the bell rings at a certain time?!)

You either walked, or based on the ages of your child and your stepdaughter, inserted yourself into this family willingly. Parenting responsibilities of said family and how those responsibilities are split had been determined and agreed to prior to changes that took place in your household ( new baby and new job) your stepdaughter\u2019s mom is not required to take on additional responsibilities because situations in your household changed to make your life easier  by making hers harder. \n\nWas stepdaughter\u2019s mom consulted about your husband taking this new job? Did she get a vote, considering you seem to think she should have to be the one dealing with consequences of your husband\u2019s new schedule? Is she the one primarily benefiting for what I expect is a healthy pay increase?  If not she should be mentioned nowhere in your post. \n\nYou and your husband made the decision for him to accept this promotion and the new schedule it entails. You two and your children are the ones who will benefit the most from it financially. How you to will need to change your household dynamics to make it work and honor what seems to be a longstanding agreement on parenting responsibilities split between him and his ex wife is your issues not hers. \n\nIf you feel your husband trick you into this that makes him an a** as well. The option here are your husband going back to his old job and schedule and give up the financial benefits that come with it for you and your family, you stepping up to help him with his responsibilities for his daughter, or him figuring something out such as finding a carpool for her to school . No of this is his ex wife issue, nor should you expect it to be. \n\nLastly a lot of people on here are suggesting that you possibly being a homewrecker has nothing to do with the situation in your post. I strongly disagree. If you are, you broke up his ex wife\u2019s family and made her job as a parent infinitely harder, making her a single parent, while you got a co parent for your child. Now again a situation comes up that you and your husband benefit from ( financially and professionally) and you are suggesting she once again should take on more responsibility as a parent to make your life as a parent easier.
