I work from home and am the primary caregiver for both of our kids.\nOur 8 yo recently switched to a different and better school, which happens to be minutes away from my stepdaughter\u2019s school.

I assumed that nobody was available to take her since he said when nobody was available in our previous conversation. I think it\u2019s important to know that Both the 8 & 9 year olds start school at the same so this is a problem. I said I would try it anyway. But in doing so, it became very hectic trying to get both kids ready at once, feeding them breakfast, getting the baby ready, etc. Ended up leaving 8 minutes later than planned so my step daughter was on time and my son was borderline late/running to class. So I told my husband I couldn\u2019t take her every day and questioned why I had to when her Mom was home. He said I left too late & started saying things like \u201cI didn\u2019t know it would be such a big deal to help me out\u201d & \u201csorry my children are such an inconvenience for you.\u201d Etc. I explained that shes not an inconvenience, but has a perfectly ready and available parent to take her, it was hard getting everyone ready on time, the kids were playing and not getting ready, plus the baby, all of it. I reminded him that when we spoke, he said emergencies and when nobody was available but her Mom called her this morning to tell her to have a good day and where to be picked up so this wasn\u2019t the case today.  I told him his children are his responsibility and he cant get upset when I cant take responsibility for them as well as my own children and that it wasn\u2019t fair to expect that. \n\nI cant help but wondering if this was his plan all along- to move my son schools and then assign me to carpool without even communicating- especially since he doubled down and was saying his kids were an inconvenience and trying to guilt me. If the situation had been fully communicated, I would have said no. My schedule is crazy enough trying to manage the house, my job, and an 8 month old while working. \nHowever, I cant help feeling like an asshole. If they we\u2019re being dropped off at the same school, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.

Could you make all this work? Sure. But that isn't what this is about. It is about the principle of the matter. Your husband wasn't up front with his intentions at all, and I think he is likely happy to not have the extra fuss of taking his daughter to her mom's house every morning so mom can handle getting her ready and dropping her off at school (and I'm sure mom is happy not to have to bother too). Emergencies and on call are one thing, but this is obviously not what is happening. I think you need to take a hard stance on this before it just becomes expected that you are going to do it every day. I think that every time he asks you to take her, you need to ask him if it is an emergency and if he says yes, refuse to commit until he tells you what the emergency is or what the circumstances are that keep him/the mom from being able to do it. Press him for that info, and don't back down and don't do it if his answer is not acceptable. NTA, OP, and good luck!", "INFO: how did your relationship begin? He has a child with someone else that\u2019s only a year older than the child you have with him?", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA.

Husband doesn't help *AT ALL* in the morning routines, so he doesn't get to add a kid into the mix.  Daughter can stick with her regular routine of her *dad and mom* parenting her.", "i can't believe people are saying you are TA given that you have an 8-month-old and a FT job.  and yea school traffic sucks. \n\nsounds like it's not a favor to him as much as it helping out the ex too. what is she doing while you are managing chaos?", "NTA. Reddit just likes to poop on step-parents who aren't constantly bending over backwards. It's easier for her mum to drop her off, it's part of their routine, she gets time with her mum in the morning and everyone is on time. This arrangement is fine, what reason would your husband have for wanting to change it?", "ESH - You are not playing as team members of the same team. Including your step daughter into your daily routine is not a significant \"hardship\".\n\nHe should had told you that from the start. And you would had been TA if you had said \"no\".\n\nOtherwise, what you are saying is that you don't feel responsible for his kids, and he shouldn't  feel responsible for yours.\n\nWhich sounds crazy.", "why dont u just drop one off earlier than the other lol i dont get it", "Some of the comments here are wild. OP is NTA. She is being super helpful by taking her stepdaughter into school when he is on call. It is not her responsibility to drop her stepchild off at school when he isn't on call. Do people not remember how insane it is to take care of an 8 month old while getting older kids to and from school/events? One blowout diaper can put the entire morning out of sync. If your husband asks you to take your stepchild in and he isn't on call, I would suggest that he drop the two older kids off instead. Leaving you to breastfeed in peace and get ready for your work day.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband, stepdaughter, and stepdaughter's mother have a dropoff routine that does not involve you except for when he's on call one week each month. You help out when he's on call and make things work.\n\nHe tried to switch it up and get you start taking core of dropoffs even when he's not on call. Surprising you with that at the last minute was a dirty trick. Not being honest about her mom being available to do the dropoff as usual was an overt lie of omission.\n\nHe seems very not trustworthy IMO.", "NTA. You can't just drop a child off extra early for school. There's a pretty narrow and inflexible window. If there isn't enough time to get to one school, deal with traffic in the drop-off line, get to the other school, and deal with traffic in the other drop-off line, one kid is going to be tardy. If it happens more than on a very rare occasion, that's going to cause problems with truancy laws (at least it would in my state). \n\nIn an emergency, that's ok - and it sounds like what you agreed to. But it sounds like your husband has decided he doesn't want to take the time to leave for work however much earlier he has to every day in order to take his daughter to her mother's house, even if she's available.", "What is the alternative?  Do you expect your husband to do drop off for his daughter or her mother to come all the way to your home to get her and take her to school?  If so Yta.  You are going that way, it seems logical to take both kids. Now it\u2019s fair to ask for help to get everyone ready in the morning but expecting your husband to drive separately when you are going that way is petty.", "YTA. You married a man with children, when they are in your home during his parenting time you are part of the parenting team. Both children are old enough to get themselves ready, if it is so difficult to make breakfast for one extra child, then start a little earlier so you can get out the door in time to drop them both off.", "[deleted]", "There\u2019s not a bus?", "More Info Needed:\n\nOP, that week of the month, why doesn't the mom pick her daughter up on her way home from work? Then she can take her kid home, get her ready and off to school?\n\nOr, have you considered renting a stop on a private school bus? Many people in your position pay a fee for pickups. Schedule it for before you leave with your child, and she can ride the bus to school. If it's only one week a month, it should not be a big deal or even too expensive.", "NTA about being upset about the struggle. Mornings can be hectic. I wonder how things would play out if you had commitments a few times that prevented you from getting them ready and dropped off at school and your husband did the carpooling and corralling a few mornings each month. I'm sure you'll find a reasonable routine after a dozen first hand experiences on how crazy it gets. That being said, YWBTA if you treated your stepdaughter like a chore and a problem. The problem isn't her or who's responsibility because she came with the package and is now part of your family. The problem is lack of teamwork and communication. Hopefully, with a little perspective y'all can work something fair and equal out. Good luck.", "YTA - when you married him you knew he had children and that they would also become your children\u2026 right? Or did he keep the kids a secret until after you were married?", "YTA- leave earlier and get over it. It amazes me when I hear someone who has step kids act like they have no responsibility for them. You are expecting their mom to come all the way over and pick her up and take her to school because it was\u2026stressful? Parenting is stressful. Plan your day/ morning better, you have 4 kids, not two. Drop one of the kids off a little early and get the others there on time. Put on your big girl panties and be a responsible mom.", "Nta", "INFO: How far away are these schools from your house?", "INFO: Does your husband have primary custody of your stepdaughter? is that why he drops her off to her mom every morning?", "INFO - what does the mother think about this?  I didn\u2019t see you mention how many days a week step daughter stays at your house, but if it\u2019s all weekdays, I\u2019d imagine the mother likes the little bit of extra time she gets with her. You two should ~~double team him~~ team up and take him down.", "Why aren\u2019t both kids going to the same school?", "You need to let him know that you see through him, that way he'll stop.\n\n\"You are trying to get me to take her every day. You ain't slick. You thought you could work up to making me do all of it. It's not happening. I only take over for you when you're on call, and even that is very hard on me.

I'm sorry OP.\n\n\nFor both kids, I'm confused - is there no school bus?  Or could you all create a carpool system with other parents in the neighborhood?  \n\n\nThis said, the way your husband is acting is NOT great. I get the vibe that he wants you to be the full-time parent and perhaps quit your job.  \n\n\nIf the baby isn't in daycare yet, pls put them in daycare. You need a break.\n\n\nNTA", "INFO: I saw this elsewhere on reddit - given that your husband thinks it's no problem to get both kids ready plus baby, just say, 'ok husband, can you show me how it's done?  I'll take notes.'  \n\n\nLet him show you how to get 3 kids ready plus yourself and get them to school.  And if he refuses, his refusal tells me that he knows he's asking the impossible of you. And doesn't care.  \n\n\nThat's not a healthy partner. This isn't a healthy marriage.", "Finally, someone who gets it. I don\u2019t mind helping out, totally not that. But this isn\u2019t her normal routine or mine and its really the sneakiness of the communication that bothers me. It feels like his intentions were to slowly build up and get me to eventually do it all the time without communicating that.", "thank you! agree!", "I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not the only one wondering about that math.", "Yeah, I'm kind of stuck on that. Very relevant. Affair partner/affair baby is my guess.", "Yep. Long story but irrelevant to this post.", "That\u2019s exactly my point. I feel like some of these people leaving hateful comments either dont have kids, haven\u2019t worked from home, haven\u2019t worked around an infant or sat in school traffic. Or all of the above. THANK YOU.", "No, I do it all. He starts work at 6 am when not on call and gets home at 5 pm. Im doing everything with the baby including working. I even bring her to my office when I have to go to the office.", "EXACTLY. Im over here struggling while her Mom is just sleeping in. I manage 3 kids + an infant while working full time from home for a large Tech company. It\u2019s stressful. I don\u2019t need anything else on my plate. Taking care of your own children is the least he can do in my opinion. I already manage our two children almost 100% of the time and do everything for and with them. Why should I have the added responsibility of his child too??", "100000% yes. This is exactly the point for me", "My step daughters normal routine is to be dropped off at her Moms on his way to work. Mom then gets her ready and drives her to school. This is not a normal thing for me to be driving both kids to school. \n\nAlso my kids are his kids, but his kids are not my kids. So not really a fair comparison.", "Because there is only a 15 minute drop off between both schools and sitting in school drop off traffic would mean one of them will be late every day", "Because that would be playing right into his masterful scheme all along to have children switch up schools just so OP would have to bear the heavy cross of an extra drop-off a few blocks away! \ud83d\ude44\n\n(i.e., you\u2019re entirely right)", "Yup. Exactly. I feel like some of these people don\u2019t understand the logistical issues of school drop offs in the morning", "Again, as stated in the original post her normal routine is that her Dad drops her off at her Moms in the morning and her Mom gets her ready for school and drops her off. This is not the normal routine for me to be driving her but it seems like that was his plan without communicating that.", "I wouldn\u2019t mind helping but that means one child will always be late", "Yes I understand that but one child would always be late.", "No", "It seems like everyone is missing the point. Its NOT the one week out of the month, its ALL the other days that he didn\u2019t ask about and tried to just spring on me without communicating. The one week out of the month is totally FINE. I can do that. But today he was NOT on call and her mother was home. He failed to mention she was home and I had no idea until her mother called her in the morning to tell her to have a good day. It felt sneaky. It felt like he asked me about 1 week a month, but really had the intention of sticking me with it all the time.", "Exactly. She is not the problem and to me, his comments were deflecting and showing the true intent behind the original agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re already doing it when Im on call, might as well do it all the time!\u201d I felt in that moment if I didn\u2019t set the boundary, he would walk all over it. It\u2019s impossible for him to do ANY of the morning work. He leaves the house at 5 am and gets home at 5 pm even when hes not on call so he is basically incapable of doing the morning routine with just our older son let alone both. When I gave birth to our daughter in October he did the morning routine for two weeks and then was very vocal about how \u201che can\u2019t wait to go back to work!\u201d But yet, Im the unreasonable one for not wanting to add more chaos to my already hectic mornings.", "Obviously I knew about them but wasn\u2019t under the impression that I would have to share equal responsibility for them when her Mom is ready and available.", "Umm again, this is not her normal routine. Normally her Dad takes her to her Mom on his way to work. Her mom gets her ready and takes her to school. I dont get how Im an AH because all of a sudden my husband decided that this is my job without communicating the full intention.

My husband normally drops her off at her Moms on his way to work.", "Mom works evenings but not overnight. So we have her on the nights Mom works. Mom has her in the morning before school and during the day on breaks and then brings her here on her way to work if no school. Otherwise she is at daycare after school until my husband picks her up after work. This is the schedule we have had for as long as I can remember. Only recently when my son switched schools is when this conversation started, which is why it feels sneaky.", "She would prefer to have her but if hes on call, Im not going to make her come and pick her up before school, thats silly. But Im not going to be driving her over there before school either so we will make do when the time comes.", "We live in the next city over from my step daughter\u2019s mother where my stepdaughter attends school. We did a transfer and tried to get our son into her school but it was full so we were sent to a nearby school.

He can gripe all he wants but he made her and she is his child not yours", "No", "Thats what I\u2019m saying- that was the original agreement between us - that I would help when hes on call, I have no issue with that. Today, he was not on call and her mother was home(unbeknownst to me until she called her this morning) and he asked me to take her. I have no problem helping when hes on call.

Why is it possible for her to help out one week per month when he is on call and then the other three weeks it's 'too hard/too far apart/one will always be late'\u2014if this is the case, would it not apply every day and four weeks per month? If the grievance is with the dad dumping his duties on her without asking, then okay. But she's not focusing on him but instead complaining it's too hard but magically she is able to do it one week a month. So which is it? It's \"too hard\" or she resents the father not asking her?", "omg\nhow anyone thinks you are self serving when an 8-month-old and a FT job are also involved is just beyond belief.\n\nedit: typo", "Then how do you explain getting pregnant to a man who had an infant with another woman? Just curious.", "I think you are NTA and I think it needs to be clarified that he's hoisting this new arrangement on you OUTSIDE of his on-call week.  if you didn't WFH I would be more likely to say you are  TA and agree with others' points, but yeah he is taking advantage of your willingness to step up during the week when he is on call, and trying to expand it to his non-on-call weeks. \n\n(when you are also balancing an 8month old and a job.) NTA.", "This wasn\u2019t clear in your post so you should probably make an edit. I agree with you that your husband should keep the normal routine when he\u2019s not on call. There\u2019s nothing wrong with setting that boundary. However, her mother has nothing to do with this issue. She was never supposed to come to your house in the morning. Your stepdaughter is supposed to be brought to her. If your husband decides to drop some of his parenting duties in your lap, that\u2019s not her problem and she doesn\u2019t have to fix it for you.

If she is too overwhelmed and has a fulltime job then that applies all month. 5 times a month is not an emergency it's a recurring schedule that she should not have agreed to and needs to update if it does not work for her", "Are you for real? Just because it's \"more doable\" doesn't mean it's a good idea. That's like saying \"less robbery is better than all the time!\" How about NONE if it doesn't work?

Someone else mentioned they need a better plan and I agree. Why even do the month if one extra day would put you over the edge? Like I don't see how people keep arguing about how she has too much on her plate but for some reason it's great she's doing this 60 times a year?", "I am not picking up on a nasty attitude toward her step children. Rather, I sense frustration at how this was handled and exhaustion from what she has on her plate (infant, WFH job).

I\u2019m sure the little girl wants to be with her mom and op, but op isn\u2019t her mom and when you have kids with someone it\u2019s a joint effort not an effort to be pushed on others just because one parent is mad at the other or lazy. There are far to many men who love to push all the responsibility of children onto the women or spouse just because they have this idea of how things are supposed to be but op has a full time job and a baby to deal with along with her own kids.

You have a lot on your plate already so can understand your frustration but they way you talk about the kid seems kid like you are uninterested and is just an annoyance to you.

In other words, outright lied to her, for reasons only known to him. \n\nIt would be better if you could get all three of you in the same room at the same time and discuss it, because it sounds like your husband is engaging in some triangulation here.
