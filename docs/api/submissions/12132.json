She went through chemo, radiation therapy, several surgeries. Especially when she had chemo, she\u2018d always lay in her bad or on the couch half passed-out because obviously chemo can make you feel quite shitty. As you can guess, it was a tough time for me. Not only the fact that obviously I was in fear because she had cancer but also the fact that I constantly saw her in such a bad state of health. I was alone a lot during that time and learnt to be independent. I felt lonely, scared und just wasn\u2018t in a good place mentally. She was diagnosed a month or so before my birthday and had to go to hospital for surgery on the day of my birthday. The treatment went on for about 2 years. \n\nNow, luckily my mother is better now. It\u2018s been 7ish years since she was diagnosed. However, I still have this weird thing about her taking a nap. It brings me back to when she was in her bed or the couch half unconscious back when she had chemo. I won\u2018t tell her not to nap, obviously. So whenever she takes a nap, which is only like once a month or so, I will leave the house and go for a walk or something because it helps me relax. This however means, that my brother will have to answer the phone (mom is asleep, I\u2019m not home) which he hates. So he told me I\u2018m an AH for always leaving when my mom is asleep because that means he will have to pick up phone calls. I said I was sorry but I needed this time for myself and if he hated answering the phone so much, he could always just not answer it and we\u2018ll call the person back later. He wasn\u2018t happy with that and called me a huge AH for basically \"forcing him to pick up the phone although I know he hates that\u201c. I didn\u2018t say anything after that.

I hated answering the phone too when my parents and siblings went out, so I just ignored it. There are maybe some workarounds - buy a phone that displays who's calling, or even just tell him and your mom about the flashbacks you have. Still, that's like a lot of effort to go when your brother could just learn to answer the phone like a normal person....", "Nta.
