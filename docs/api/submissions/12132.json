She went through chemo, radiation therapy, several surgeries. Especially when she had chemo, she\u2018d always lay in her bad or on the couch half passed-out because obviously chemo can make you feel quite shitty. As you can guess, it was a tough time for me. Not only the fact that obviously I was in fear because she had cancer but also the fact that I constantly saw her in such a bad state of health. I was alone a lot during that time and learnt to be independent. I felt lonely, scared und just wasn\u2018t in a good place mentally. She was diagnosed a month or so before my birthday and had to go to hospital for surgery on the day of my birthday. The treatment went on for about 2 years. \n\nNow, luckily my mother is better now. It\u2018s been 7ish years since she was diagnosed. However, I still have this weird thing about her taking a nap. It brings me back to when she was in her bed or the couch half unconscious back when she had chemo. I won\u2018t tell her not to nap, obviously. So whenever she takes a nap, which is only like once a month or so, I will leave the house and go for a walk or something because it helps me relax. This however means, that my brother will have to answer the phone (mom is asleep, I\u2019m not home) which he hates. So he told me I\u2018m an AH for always leaving when my mom is asleep because that means he will have to pick up phone calls. I said I was sorry but I needed this time for myself and if he hated answering the phone so much, he could always just not answer it and we\u2018ll call the person back later. He wasn\u2018t happy with that and called me a huge AH for basically \"forcing him to pick up the phone although I know he hates that\u201c. I didn\u2018t say anything after that.

What about when no one but your brother is home? \n\nNTA. I'm glad you have found a way that helps you relax, but I also think you should seek some therapy if possible (even if it's \"just\" to talk). How do you feel when your mother is sleeping for the night?

Seriously he needs to get over himself, why would OP have to answer  phone anymore that he does?", "Yeah, right!

You are dealing with a stressful thing to you in a way that doesn\u2019t cause any discomfort or real problem for anyone else.  Your brother is dealing with another issue.  He is likely very introverted and has stress whenever he has to start a conversation\u2026even if it is just \u201chello?\u201d.  That\u2019s a real thing.  The difference here is that you ARE dealing with your emotional issue and he is not.  He is demanding that YOU deal with his emotional issue and to continue helping him to NOT deal with his emotional issue.  THAT is enabling and you should not be bullied into going along with it.  You are not responsible for his comfort AND he needs to deal with this issue before he has to go into the adult world and be FORCED to deal with it or live through being fired over and over again and never getting better jobs or advances or better pay because he refuses to resolve his own emotional issues.  I don\u2019t know how old your brother is (sounds like middle school behavior?) but it\u2019s time he dig in and start to work on this discomfort he is having by aggressively facing his fears.", "NTA.
