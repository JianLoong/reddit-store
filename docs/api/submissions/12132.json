She went through chemo, radiation therapy, several surgeries.

Not only the fact that obviously I was in fear because she had cancer but also the fact that I constantly saw her in such a bad state of health. I was alone a lot during that time and learnt to be independent. I felt lonely, scared und just wasn\u2018t in a good place mentally.

It\u2018s been 7ish years since she was diagnosed. However, I still have this weird thing about her taking a nap. It brings me back to when she was in her bed or the couch half unconscious back when she had chemo. I won\u2018t tell her not to nap, obviously. So whenever she takes a nap, which is only like once a month or so, I will leave the house and go for a walk or something because it helps me relax. This however means, that my brother will have to answer the phone (mom is asleep, I\u2019m not home) which he hates. So he told me I\u2018m an AH for always leaving when my mom is asleep because that means he will have to pick up phone calls. I said I was sorry but I needed this time for myself and if he hated answering the phone so much, he could always just not answer it and we\u2018ll call the person back later. He wasn\u2018t happy with that and called me a huge AH for basically \"forcing him to pick up the phone although I know he hates that\u201c. I didn\u2018t say anything after that.
