I need some perspective, so I'm turning to you, Reddit. Here's what happened:\r  \n\r  \nI (28M) work as an Uber driver to make ends meet. Last week, I received a request to pick up a passenger, let's call her Sarah (30F), who indicated in the app that she was pregnant. I arrived at the designated location, and Sarah got into the car. At first, everything seemed normal.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, as the ride progressed, Sarah started acting really nauseous. She asked if we could make a pit stop at a gas station so she could use the restroom and get some fresh air. I obliged and pulled into the nearest gas station, thinking it was a reasonable request given her condition.\r  \n\r  \nWhile Sarah was inside the gas station, I noticed that the air freshener in my car had run out, and the smell was becoming overwhelming. I decided to quickly step outside to get some fresh air myself and remove the empty air freshener. Just as I opened the door, I saw Sarah coming out of the gas station, accompanied by the strong smell of cigarette smoke.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I have a strict no-smoking policy in my car, as it's unpleasant and could potentially damage my vehicle. I explained this to Sarah and kindly asked her if she had been smoking. She admitted that she had, claiming it helped her cope with her morning sickness. I apologized but firmly told her that I couldn't continue the ride if she continued to smoke.\r  \n\r  \nSarah became angry and started arguing with me, saying that I was discriminating against her because she was pregnant. She insisted that her smoking was justified because it helped her feel better. The situation quickly escalated, and she refused to put out her cigarette or get out of the car.\r  \n\r  \nFeeling frustrated and concerned for my vehicle's well-being, I decided to end the trip right then and there. I kindly asked Sarah to leave, explaining that I couldn't tolerate smoking in my car. She was outraged and accused me of being heartless and uncaring towards pregnant women.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I'm left wondering if I handled the situation correctly.
