The situation quickly escalated, and she refused to put out her cigarette or get out of the car.\r  \n\r  \nFeeling frustrated and concerned for my vehicle's well-being, I decided to end the trip right then and there. I kindly asked Sarah to leave, explaining that I couldn't tolerate smoking in my car. She was outraged and accused me of being heartless and uncaring towards pregnant women.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I'm left wondering if I handled the situation correctly.

Smoking can absolutely trigger nausea as it's a gastric irritant so I find that hard to believe, although she isn't the first to have said it.
