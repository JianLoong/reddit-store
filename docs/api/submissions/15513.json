She will probably win as YOU were the person who chose to move away! You are the person denying equitable visitation, NOT your ex!\n\nEdit: How do you think changing a 50/50 custody agreement to one where your ex sees her child 2 days/month remotely fair? Are you planning on seeking child support on top of that?", "YTA It is in the best interest of your child to maintain a healthy relationship with both of her parents.

The person who\u2019s going to pay for it will be your daughter.", "YTA. Where I come from it's illegal to move away and take your kid with you. My ex-wife tried to move away and I put a kibosh on that.  I gave her legal notification that if she took the kid it would be considered child kidnapping, which is exactly what you did. \n\nPS I don't live in USA", "~~ESH.~~ After reading your comments, YTA. You should have hashed all this out prior to the move, and put together a formal custody agreement to avoid this exact issue. I think it's also unfair to say that just because your daughter prefers to stay with you fulltime that her mom should have to just deal with this and have no contact. As long as the mom is a fit parent and isn't abusing your daughter, she has just as much right to time with her as you do. You are unfairly depriving your ex of time with her daughter, and your comments show you don't care about this at all. \n\nI understand why your daughter may not like flying back and forth, but you created this situation and now thing it's okay to deprive your ex of time with her daughter. That's not okay. If your ex takes you to court, you will not like the outcome.", "Sorry, but YTA here. Your divorce decree probably gives her so much time with her child, and you accepted that there might be difficulties when you chose to relocate at such a distance. It\u2019s your job to comply with the visitation order. If it\u2019s a big burden, all you can do is go back to court and try to get the custody stipulations changed. She can give you a lot of legal headaches if you don\u2019t. It would be nice if she offered to change her times or pick up the tab for the plane fare, but your hands are probably tied  here legally. My advice here is to either find a way to make it work or return to court.

You already checked with the lawyers about the legalities, you said you don't care about your ex at all, and you've already acted on all of the mentioned actions.\n\nYour ex has every right to be upset, she has every right to not be happy with the new arrangement and you're acting ridiculous to expect a parent to not want to see their daughter for more than once a month. \n\nYou're not a single dad so you can't make these plans unilaterally without a headache, and now you're facing the headache.", "Edit YTA cause of his absurd replies\n\nNAH\n\nSeems like a case of two exes struggling to find a middle ground.", "NTA it's time to get a formal custody agreement. Your daughter is old enough that her opinion will have weight with a judge.", "YTA. It is supposed to be what is in the best interest of the child. In split household situations that usually require some sacrifice on both ends so the child can have a good relationship with both parents. You are doing what you want and painting it up as what the child wants to make it look better. Plus, what kids want doesn't always line up with what they need - your job as a parent is to make the sacrifice to ensure they have what they need, even if it's not what they want. We have been wanting to move for years & we are only waiting because our oldest 2 have other parents in the equation that they need to have in their lives.\n\nSince you've already made your decision and forged ahead with what's best for you, I absolutely think you should foot the bill and make her go to her mom's every weekend or every other weekend.

Let the professionals help you work out a custody agreement that works for the both of you.", "NTA.  Interesting that everyone is jumping on you and avoiding the actual question like why doesn't your daughter want to spend time with her mom.

Keep doing that. Her wants come before her mothers. At 14, children don\u2019t want to spend as much time with parents. If monthly is too much for her, then go with what she wants.", "A successful compromise often means both parties aren't happy. Your daughter is old enough to decide where she wants to live and what that means with you living so far apart. Outside of the money I think flying out weekly isn't very reasonable, so much time traveling etc. Once a month, with flex, and perhaps longer stays in the summer to offset if are much more practical.\n\nNTA - this is a tricky problem that requires an evolving solution. You may want to get a legal consultation to understand respective rights and/or a mediator to help structure things fairly ( or perhaps more importantly give everyone confidence it's not biased)", "NTA - go to court and get something in writing.
