She will probably win as YOU were the person who chose to move away! You are the person denying equitable visitation, NOT your ex!\n\nEdit: How do you think changing a 50/50 custody agreement to one where your ex sees her child 2 days/month remotely fair? Are you planning on seeking child support on top of that?", "YTA It is in the best interest of your child to maintain a healthy relationship with both of her parents.

The person who\u2019s going to pay for it will be your daughter.", "YTA. Where I come from it's illegal to move away and take your kid with you. My ex-wife tried to move away and I put a kibosh on that.  I gave her legal notification that if she took the kid it would be considered child kidnapping, which is exactly what you did. \n\nPS I don't live in USA", "~~ESH.~~ After reading your comments, YTA. You should have hashed all this out prior to the move, and put together a formal custody agreement to avoid this exact issue. I think it's also unfair to say that just because your daughter prefers to stay with you fulltime that her mom should have to just deal with this and have no contact. As long as the mom is a fit parent and isn't abusing your daughter, she has just as much right to time with her as you do. You are unfairly depriving your ex of time with her daughter, and your comments show you don't care about this at all. \n\nI understand why your daughter may not like flying back and forth, but you created this situation and now thing it's okay to deprive your ex of time with her daughter.

She can give you a lot of legal headaches if you don\u2019t. It would be nice if she offered to change her times or pick up the tab for the plane fare, but your hands are probably tied  here legally.

In split household situations that usually require some sacrifice on both ends so the child can have a good relationship with both parents. You are doing what you want and painting it up as what the child wants to make it look better. Plus, what kids want doesn't always line up with what they need - your job as a parent is to make the sacrifice to ensure they have what they need, even if it's not what they want. We have been wanting to move for years & we are only waiting because our oldest 2 have other parents in the equation that they need to have in their lives.\n\nSince you've already made your decision and forged ahead with what's best for you, I absolutely think you should foot the bill and make her go to her mom's every weekend or every other weekend.

Let the professionals help you work out a custody agreement that works for the both of you.", "NTA.  Interesting that everyone is jumping on you and avoiding the actual question like why doesn't your daughter want to spend time with her mom.

If monthly is too much for her, then go with what she wants.", "A successful compromise often means both parties aren't happy. Your daughter is old enough to decide where she wants to live and what that means with you living so far apart. Outside of the money I think flying out weekly isn't very reasonable, so much time traveling etc. Once a month, with flex, and perhaps longer stays in the summer to offset if are much more practical.\n\nNTA - this is a tricky problem that requires an evolving solution.

They took a job to better their life and the daughter chose (chose. wasnt forced) to go with. If the daughter is old enough to make that decision it should be honored. It sucks for mommy but ultimately its whats best for the kid and the kid made their decision. Mommy can move closer if she wants to see daughter more.", "In a lot of places the child is old enough to decide which parent they want to live with. If they ask her the other parents might not even get a say since she wanted to move.", "The child is 50% hers, and 50% his. He needs to take that into account and not play these games.", "In most jurisdictions in the US so long as there is no custody order you can grab your kid and move overnight. But as a practical matter, the ex could go to court and file emergency motion to get a custody order in place to stop it, because judges usually frown upon sudden moves. But if the kid flat says I want to move the judge will usually listen if the kid is old enough. At least where I practice.", "Is this the amibreakingthelaw subreddit?", "It's legal unless the other parent bothers to litigate it in court.", "For most states, 14yrs old is usually when the courts default to the child\u2019s preference. And from the information OP provided, which I understand may be biased, it sounds like the daughter wants to stay with OP. So going to court wouldn\u2019t change anything. It would just cost a ton of money", "Apparently, there's no legal custody agreement.", "Oh yeah. She has a case for kidnapping possibly if she went for it. Legally, I don\u2019t think verbal agreements are binding and they never had a custody order. \n\nI could be wrong. IANAL\n\nEdit: never mind, blew past the kid\u2019s age.", "By the time it gets to court the daughter will have been living with her father for 6 months. At least. And then the presumption is that she has a stable life in her new location.", "Yep, in the US the case would be heard in the old location unless you let 6 moths pass.", "Jesus. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019d love to be debt free and there\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019d be willing to do to make that happen, but trading my memories with my mom isn\u2019t one of them.", "That's not true, in US it's only illegal if you're engaging in sex trafficking or violating a custody order. In absence of a custody order you can take your kid and go.\n\nI'm voting NTA, there's no custody order, daughter wants to live with father, father shouldn't be nailed to one place due to his ex.", "You would think even with no formal agreement the mother would still have some kind of paternal rights.", "Yup. Like it's missing parts for an actual way to count for if he is or isn't an AH but honestly the child is what matters", "It still would be in the old location because Mom still lives there. Jurisdiction would only change if Mom moved out of the original county. Then Dad could petition to move the case to his county.", "So the big thing here is the child's age. You are correct. At 14 her opinion will count the most. In most states, the age for that is 12. If I am reading this right, there was never a court custody agreement. Guess what that means... possession is 9/10ths. This is why a lot of times a parent will run with a child, and nothing can be done about it since there is no official custody agreement. I would highly suggest you get an attorney now! Do not wait for her mother to get one. What really matters is what is in the best interest of the child. According to this, she is flourishing, and that is what is going to matter. You are not keeping her from her mom with any malice, and that also goes a long way. It wouldn't be a bad idea, if it is financially an option, to get your daughter a lawyer as well as a counselor. Establish her feelings in official documents this way, and you will show a concerted pattern. You have to protect yourself, and more importantly you need to protect your child!\n\nI wish you, and your daughter the best!", "The thing is if the move is already made the judge can\u2019t do an every other weekend. They will have to choose one household or the other because you can\u2019t do a 12 hour drive Friday night and again Sunday afternoon. It just physically will not work. And normally the judge will punish the parent who moved, saying \u201cwell that was your choice to move, so you lose.\u201d  But if the teenager flat out says I want to move, there is a strong possibility the judge will listen.", "> I don\u2019t really take him at his word\n\n\n\nThen there's absolutely no point in you commenting on this thread then, is there?", "Two can play that game, he\u2019s arguing with people in the thread and the consensus is that he\u2019s the asshole. That\u2019s against the sub rules, you\u2019re supposed to take advice and why post at all if you\u2019re not going to take peoples criticism and advice? Notice how multiple people went back and changed their vote after seeing OP expand in the comments.", "What's in the child's best interest is for one parent not to move the child 13 hours away from the other parent.", "It takes 14 hours to drive from San Ysidro to Crescent City. So California is included in there. 12 hours from San Ysidro to Yreka and 13 hours from San Ysidro to Fairport.", "Given traffic there, I simply don't believe this.", "Omg. Why are you yelling?", "sooooo you let your 14 year old run your life? that\u2019s even worse", "I haven't noticed that and I'm not going to check. Also I don't really take you at your word so as far as I'm concerned your whole comment is just nonsense.", "That depends on how the other parent is. There are some parents that being on the literal other side of the world isn't far enough away.", "As I said, whilw technically possible, I can't believe OP moved to a tiny town in NorCa from a border townl for a job opportunity or vice versa. There's not really opportunity north of the Bay Area. I suppose if you teach college, you could get a job at Humbolt but that's about it. Nobody moves to Yreka for a job.", "Clear to see who the fool is in your username.", "Why does \"not in the US\" matter at all morally here? This sub is for moral advice, not legal ones."]}
