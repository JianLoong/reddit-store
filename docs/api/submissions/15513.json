She will probably win as YOU were the person who chose to move away! You are the person denying equitable visitation, NOT your ex!\n\nEdit: How do you think changing a 50/50 custody agreement to one where your ex sees her child 2 days/month remotely fair? Are you planning on seeking child support on top of that?", "YTA It is in the best interest of your child to maintain a healthy relationship with both of her parents.

The person who\u2019s going to pay for it will be your daughter.", "YTA. Where I come from it's illegal to move away and take your kid with you. My ex-wife tried to move away and I put a kibosh on that.  I gave her legal notification that if she took the kid it would be considered child kidnapping, which is exactly what you did. \n\nPS I don't live in USA", "~~ESH.~~ After reading your comments, YTA. You should have hashed all this out prior to the move, and put together a formal custody agreement to avoid this exact issue. I think it's also unfair to say that just because your daughter prefers to stay with you fulltime that her mom should have to just deal with this and have no contact. As long as the mom is a fit parent and isn't abusing your daughter, she has just as much right to time with her as you do. You are unfairly depriving your ex of time with her daughter, and your comments show you don't care about this at all. \n\nI understand why your daughter may not like flying back and forth, but you created this situation and now thing it's okay to deprive your ex of time with her daughter. That's not okay. If your ex takes you to court, you will not like the outcome.", "Sorry, but YTA here. Your divorce decree probably gives her so much time with her child, and you accepted that there might be difficulties when you chose to relocate at such a distance. It\u2019s your job to comply with the visitation order. If it\u2019s a big burden, all you can do is go back to court and try to get the custody stipulations changed. She can give you a lot of legal headaches if you don\u2019t. It would be nice if she offered to change her times or pick up the tab for the plane fare, but your hands are probably tied  here legally. My advice here is to either find a way to make it work or return to court.

You may not be together anymore but you do still have a daughter together and any decision you make that will affect the relationship she has with your ex needs to be agreed upon before it is enacted.  \n\nAt this point your daughter is 14 and has a right to have a say in how she spends her life but you have rigged the game in your favor by taking her already.  I\u2019m honestly not sure what the solution is but YTA for sure.", "YTA. You're a dad, you shouldn't move 13 hours away from your child's mum. It seems like you are alienating your daughter from her mum. Stick to the old agreement or get a new custody agreement in place ASAP.", "I mean what do you want from all of this? Do you want a guilt-free conscious?  You already checked with the lawyers about the legalities, you said you don't care about your ex at all, and you've already acted on all of the mentioned actions.\n\nYour ex has every right to be upset, she has every right to not be happy with the new arrangement and you're acting ridiculous to expect a parent to not want to see their daughter for more than once a month. \n\nYou're not a single dad so you can't make these plans unilaterally without a headache, and now you're facing the headache.", "NAH\n\nSeems like a case of two exes struggling to find a middle ground.", "NTA it's time to get a formal custody agreement. Your daughter is old enough that her opinion will have weight with a judge.", "YTA. It is supposed to be what is in the best interest of the child. In split household situations that usually require some sacrifice on both ends so the child can have a good relationship with both parents. You are doing what you want and painting it up as what the child wants to make it look better. Plus, what kids want doesn't always line up with what they need - your job as a parent is to make the sacrifice to ensure they have what they need, even if it's not what they want. We have been wanting to move for years & we are only waiting because our oldest 2 have other parents in the equation that they need to have in their lives.\n\nSince you've already made your decision and forged ahead with what's best for you, I absolutely think you should foot the bill and make her go to her mom's every weekend or every other weekend. She needs her mom in her life more than her new friends she doesn't even have a history with.", "ESH\n\nAny custody changes should be done in a court, just to cover your butt.\n\nAlso, your daughter is 14. She should have a say in what happens to her. The judge should meet with her privately and discuss her options.", "The big issue here isn't that he moved to another city for a job, it's that he has a daughter who LIKES the other city more and living with her dad.

So, why is everyone pissing on this man for making a better life for him and his daughter?\n\nAre you that inconsiderate when a man finally gets the child?\n\nYou know for a fact that if he took the job and his daughter was living with his ex, none of you would give two shits, or call him the AH for moving so far away.

Let the professionals help you work out a custody agreement that works for the both of you.", "NTA.  Interesting that everyone is jumping on you and avoiding the actual question like why doesn't your daughter want to spend time with her mom. As someone else as said you might want to start the paper work on legal custody but I am guessing you have if you already talked with a lawyer about moving so far away.\n\nI am glad you and your daughter have a good relationship.\n\nGood luck.", "nta - its a tough situation for sure.  perhaps your daughter could explain to her that she wants to only go once a month becuase she wants to have a life?  the mother should understand or try to understand but i suspect the mother will feel like she is losing her daughter.", "im going to say NTA. that said, you guys need a formal custody agreement. your daughter is 14, the courts will listen to what she wants. you have a good job and she likes where she is so its likely that you will get primary physical custody. once a month for a weekend or something is actually quite generous in this situation.\n\nyou could suggest that the mother move closer. that would all depend on her carrier, her life, and your daughter's wishes.", "NTA but you might want to go get a formal custody arrangement. Your daughter is old enough that the courts will most likely take what she wants into account. It's quite possible your ex will take you to court to get her own way, so you should be the one to start the proceedings so you don't look like you're trying to alienate her from her mother or \"kidnap\" your daughter.", "ESH except your daughter. I'm saying ESH because you both need to listen to her opinion, but more so because you should have talked about this before moving. In what universe did you both think it wouldn't be an issue?", "NTA\n\n14 is old enough to decide where she wants to live most of the time.", "NTA sounds like you\u2019re being guided by what your daughter wants. Keep doing that. Her wants come before her mothers. At 14, children don\u2019t want to spend as much time with parents. If monthly is too much for her, then go with what she wants.", "A successful compromise often means both parties aren't happy. Your daughter is old enough to decide where she wants to live and what that means with you living so far apart. Outside of the money I think flying out weekly isn't very reasonable, so much time traveling etc. Once a month, with flex, and perhaps longer stays in the summer to offset if are much more practical.\n\nNTA - this is a tricky problem that requires an evolving solution. You may want to get a legal consultation to understand respective rights and/or a mediator to help structure things fairly ( or perhaps more importantly give everyone confidence it's not biased)", "NTA - go to court and get something in writing. See what\u2019s normal for long distance in your place of living and how it works regarding residency.", "NTA,Not all children like or need both parents, especially at that age.\n\nIf your child wants to see the mother more than once a month you should allow them too,  how ever if they dont want to see the mother at all(without you manipulating rhen into it) then honestly they shouldnt have to, so just ask the child what they honestly want and go with that, if the mother doesnt like the frequency their child wants travel to her, she could travel to see her child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that you unilaterally made this decision and do not even want to compromise on suggestions made by others here shows how controlling you are.  The mom can\u2019t have her for holidays or summer because that\u2019s vacation time.  She\u2019s not just your child.", "Considering you don\u2019t even have a formal agreement, I don\u2019t think you should be acting like you know what would go down in court.", "This is a huge misconception about how court works. A judge is not going to bend to your daughter's preferences. She is a child, and while what she wants may have a little sway, the judge is still not going to throw out your ex's rights as a parent. It's her daughter too, and she has a right to have a relationship with her.", "Yes, actually. Where we live children under 18 do not get to decide - they only get to give their input, which a judge will take into consideration when deciding what is best for the child. You decided on your own that having college paid for is more important than a good relationship with both parents. You literally put a price tag on a mother-child relationship. That will not go over well with a judge in family court.", "You\u2019re not because you\u2019re acting like she doesn\u2019t have another parent. You\u2019re not coparenting well at all. You\u2019re acting like you\u2019re the only one who gets to make decisions and everyone around you just needs to deal with it. You and your ex are no longer together. Sucks, but such is life. You can\u2019t go around making decisions without having these type of conversations. You made a unilateral decision. \n\nThis just sounds like some overblown movie plot honestly.", "Then go through the legal system. You don\u2019t get to make decisions fully", "I highly doubt that honestly. You\u2019re a pretty unreliable narrator and have proven that.", "That is not a reason to severely limit the custodial time of the other parent. \n\nEven if this isn't illegal, if ex went to court and showed that there was a 50/50 arrangement and that you unilaterally changed it to move 13 hours away you would face at least financial consequences. Even if the courts allowed your daughter to stay with you your ex would get a long summer visit, long holiday visits and long weekend visits on top of your offered one weekend a month. Plus they were likely fine you for not handling it like you should in family court. \n\nThere is a name for this, parental alienation. And you were and are not the custodial parent (neither is your ex) without a legal agreement. You are now at the mercy of family court if your ex pursues this.", "So, your daughter is happy to have moved with you because she can now have a boyfriend. PLEASE say she is using a long-term birth control like an IUD of Implant. Because it sounds like she will be pregnant within a year!", "Where I live girls after age of 9 get to decide where to live so I'll appreciate if y'all would stop giving me advice based on american law", "This sub is AITA. OP asks the question but it doesn\u2019t sound like he cares about the answer.", "Then why are you here? Maybe I lied about the whole post? Maybe my comments are all lies? If you can't believe me then what are you even doing here?", "You must watch a lot of lifetime man hater movies. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThere is a such thing as a bad mom.", "Then I wish her good luck with forcing my daughter to stay somewhere she doesn't want to be\n\nMy daughter is extremely stubborn. No one can force her to do anything. She'll be sending her bsck in less than a week", "Why are you here then? You\u2019re complaining about your ex and you asked for judgement and are arguing with everyone. You didn\u2019t handle this right and you\u2019re acting like your ex is being unreasonable. It\u2019s her kid too and you are not a single parent who gets to make all the decisions.", "I don\u2019t. But OP is definitely being a bad coparent :)", "Can\u2019t imagine where she got that from\u2026\u2026"]}
