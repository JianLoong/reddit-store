There is zero defense you can offer up in this matter. Not only did you traumatize a dog, I'm sure your partner was thrilled with your decision. You seriously could not offer care as in let the dog outside or feed it? That is the bare minimum that I have seen 5 year olds accomplish with their family pet. What would have happened if the house caught fire? Would you just leave Fido there to roast or call animal control to sift its dead body from the rubble? Again, if you are this paralyzed and cannot function at the minimum level of human, you should be under supervision."]}
