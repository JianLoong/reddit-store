You say she never said anything in front of your husband *before*, which means she's been saying these things to you for some time.

She's actually escalating, and feeling very comfortable doing so bc she's facing zero opposition.\n\nYour cousin is probably not worth the effort, but is he? Is your husband worth standing up for? If he isn't, then the next question is: would you rather tell your cousin to shut up or listen to your husband complaining at you at home? Which option will bring you the most pace of mind?

It is too bad your husband doesn't understand. He was able to shut her up, but anything you said and did would have just fuelled the fire. Why bother? I hear you.", "I understand not wanting to deal with her but your actions are sending the message that your marriage is worthless. You can just give her an ultimatum and freeze her on future interactions if she continues. I would just recommend cutting her off but if you married to save face I doubt that course of action will be feasible in your culture. Either way marriage is sacred in all cultures so she won\u2019t have a leg to stand on when you give her no face in the future.", "Well shit, why you gotta insult her like that? I was just using it as a example. OP mentions it worked out for her and her husband and I'm gonna assume that means they're happy together. No one is leftovers or spare tires."]}
