It's clear that he didn't feel supported by you, like you're letting people attack the marriage. But that may not have been made clear to you prior to this incident. And it's completely valid to not feel like their opinion is important enough to you to mess with it, and maybe his approach of blowing up on the cousin piles stress onto you.
