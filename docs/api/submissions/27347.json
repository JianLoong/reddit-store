I\u2019m a stay at home mom, but i do work when i can (fathers business) and i\u2019m a college student (online) for some background. this happened yesterday, but i am still dealing with the fall out today and want to know if i did the right thing.\n\nso, i\u2019ve been pretty sick these past few days, my sons father didn\u2019t have to work yesterday, so i was expecting a bit more help with our baby and around the house. our son has never been a good sleeper, he normally wakes up around 3-4 times a night, i was up with him throughout the night, then also up throwing up. when he woke up this morning at 5:30, i woke his dad up. i had been up throwing up at 5, so wanted to sleep for a bit longer. he was furious, went on a rant about how it\u2019s the mothers job to be up with the baby. i was up with our son for around a half hour before i started feeling nauseous again. i woke him up a second time and told him i was going to be sick, and that he had to watch the baby for a few minutes. he rolled his eyes, but sat up and took him. when i came back, he had gone to our room to go back to sleep and had left our son crying hysterically in his bed. that situation had me so angry that once i calmed our son, i called my father and explained the situation. he told me to pack a bag and stay with him for a few days to rest up and decide if this is what i want. i took our son and went to my fathers house, where we still are. around 9am i started getting texts and calls of my bf panicking that we were gone. i told him that we\u2019re at my dads. he\u2019s been demanding we come home since then, and has even attempted to reach out to my dad, who basically told him to kick rocks.

That means both parents help as much as they can. If you don\u2019t work and he does, he should be getting up around his schedule, yeah, but even if he can\u2019t get up all the time it should at least happen when you\u2019re sick and on the weekends + he should be helping in the evenings and on holidays too. I have a coworker who\u2019s 24 and he has a four month old daughter, and he gets up with her at 4 AM every morning because it works with his work schedule + he goes straight home after work to help his wife with her.

Don't go back to this man, he doesn't care about you, that's blatantly clear. What kind of a person sleeps while the person they're supposed to love is throwing up and looking after a baby?

Anyways, he's a bad father and not good to you and it's great your dad has your back.", "NTA - I hope your Dad used those words.", "NTA. Your bf is a colossal AH. There are men out there who understand that it's equally both parents' jobs to tend to their babies, and who understand that sometimes they need to step up a little more when their partner is sick or struggling. You should absolutely leave your bf for good and find yourself one of those men before growing your family. The language you use is concerning. A parent should never be furious to have to wake up to take care of their infant. Infants pick up on facial expressions, tones, and body language, and it's extremely important for their development that they feel like the person tending to their needs cares about them. He also should be *begging,* not *demanding,* you to come home. On the plus side, if you leave him now, he will fade gracefully out of your life because he will have no desire to have visitation with his baby without you there to do all the work.", "NTA- look at it this way he doesn't want you to come back so he can help you take care of you or the baby.

If he isn't helping now, with an infant and you sick, he will never help.  You saved yourself a lot of anger and resentment down the road by leaving. Stay with your dad and figure out your next move. I have to laugh at him \"demanding\" you come home. The nerve.", "NTA the dad is a bad dad and worse partner but Am I the only one feeling gross about the age difference between the two?

But most is not all. And definitely not all when you're sick yourself. And what your bf did is basically neglect considering the age of the baby.\n\nSo yes, you did the right thing. You should take your father's advice and figure out what bf brings to the relationship that's so special.

That's just kinda how the cards fall. That doesn't absolve baby daddy from being a caregiver. It only means he's present less.

Go to DHS and explain the situation and tell them you are seeking child support, you are not married but this is the first step, ask them for resources in your area about  family lawyers or free lawyers you need to get a petition in the court for visitation (hopefully supervised as he can't be trusted to watch your child unsupervised). Good luck and DO NOT let him talk you out of anything or into unsupervised visits.\n\nEdit to add: Op make sure you do this ASAP. It's very important that you don't let your soon to be ex control the situation and try to file the petition first cause there is a possibility they will give you a temporary order where you get visitation and he has custody until they figure everything out in court, you need to file first. I had a friend who took her kids and didn't file against the ex and was \"doing things out of court\" and he turned around and filed that the kids have always lived with him so the order was he has temporary custody and she had visitations. It took her getting documents of medical records and people coming in and saying how things really were at a later court date.", "NTA and it's time to make a choice. You're already a single mother.

For me the relationship would have been over as soon as he started any sentence with \"the woman is supposed to\", ESPECIALLY in relation to his own child. In addition he was incredibly cruel to you and the baby. Get out, stay out. I'm glad you're safe and that you have family to help you.", "NTA, OP.
