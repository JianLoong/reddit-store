You need to consult with an attorney to find out if this is something you can get into legal trouble over because if you can, the last thing you\u2019ll be worried about is if you\u2019re the asshole in this situation.", "NTA. I don't understand all of the yta's though. To me it seems more than fair. You tried to find a way to compromise with your brother and he just wouldn't, because he wanted it all for himself. Sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire, and since you've obtained the house legally, you're good. Plus, it is not like your brother will get nothing, if I understood correctly, there is a whole lot of inheritance on its way to him from your father. \nDon't stress this out too much. But maybe go NC. Life is to short to deal with this kind of people.", "NTA. What you did makes sense. In my country it is normal to split everything equally among the children but when doing so you first deduct any properties or similarly valuable things that were gifted to them by parents in the years before. Those gifts are legally considered to be advances on the inheritance. It's all about keeping things fair. And you're worth being treated fairly regardless of what your sexist family members think.", "It sounds like you \"conned\" - legally or otherwise - the house from your brother.

The only inheritance from their mother, for the both of them, is this one house that they're both currently living in.", "My brother has in his name every one of my father's properties, which are many and a total sum of about ten times the house.

Different parent, and one the OP has deliberately chosen to not have a relationship with.\n\nIt wasn't part of the inheritance.", "It wasn't easy, no. He is bipolar and deals with addition, so his rage outbursts didn't really make up for how noble and good he was to her otherwise.", "I already consulted. I originally didn't know about the donation or the claim, so it wasn't something I planned. I gave my brother more than a month to be at home and consider my offer of buying the house, but he kept blowing me off. I talked it through for a long time with my lawyer to get to any other agreement, but my brother refused, so after making sure, I went for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only way I could somewhat get into trouble, would be if my father came out and said the property was his, which is difficult because the property was in my moms name since they bought it some twenty years ago, and also because he's already in danger of going to jail for unrelated things, and that wouldn't help his case.", ">Plus, it is not like your brother will get nothing, if I understood correctly, there is a whole lot of inheritance on its way to him from your father. \n\nI agree with this.\n\nLegally OP is not an AH (because, well it was all legally okay for OP to do that).\n\nAnd it is not like she kicked her brother out and made him homeless without a penny and all. He **has** a house in his name, one that his mother \"gifted\" him. There is a reason why inheritance law would see it sort of as an advance on his inheritance.\n\nThe fact that the dad used legal constructions not to be the legal owner of the house that was gifted to OP's brother, are side issues and irrelevant. The dad should have been smarter about it (and it apparently looks like that the dad is far from poor either). \n\nSo to me it seems ethically fair (besides the legal ok) that OP gets the house. She did offer to buy her brother out, but he was acting entitled and cruel. I hope he learns from this. But OP is definitely NTA!", "Totally fair assessment, I guess. I tried to cohabit with my brother but he just became \"king\" of the house. He started getting a bunch of people to party there every day, I understand that that might have been his way of coping, but I just felt wrong leaving and sorta letting him win again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also kept in mind my brother had my dad's full inheritance, which I honestly don't care about, either my father or his money, but he just kept poking me about keeping everything and I just wanted to grieve in peace at my home.", "There wasn't a will, the notary only informed me of the donation and the legal claim I had to the property.\n\nI tried to do it a civilised way but my brother just kept saying he wouldn't leave the house, and he started using it to drink with his friends and it just wasn't a good environment.\n\nI totally accept the judgement, I just was at my wits end and was sad to see my mom's house reduced to that.", "Because of the donation. In my country, if someone has donated a certain amount/property to one of their heirs while living, a claim can be made by the ones that didn't receive it for that amount to be extracted of their (the one who received it in life) inheritance once dead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI honestly didn't know about it either until this happened. I checked the legal code of my country and it was actually true.", "Not really, unless my father wants to come out and say he was the actual owner of the property, but he'd have to explain why it was purchased on my mother's name and stayed like that for decades.

I tried talking to him, tried to give him time, tried to get him to go to the notary with me. He just found a way to start a trifle, and I didn't feel comfortable being at home alone with him. I left him for a month there to wind down, but he just didn't want a deal, he wanted the entire house for him.", "He still has it in his name, that and a couple more of my dad\u2019s other properties", "it was in the mother's name, then transferred to the brother before the mother passed away.  Probably within the past few years in order to be LEGALLY considered part of the estate.", "Yeah your NTA\nYou offered to buy his share of a property that you had the legal rights to.\n\nYou're cool OP :)", "there wasn't really an arrangement or a contract, the my father bought the property, it went straight into my mother's name because they were still together. My mom never really cared about that place, so he didn't bother changing it until about 5 years ago. That property has technically never been my father's from a legal standpoint, that's why it counts as a valid donation that is subs tractable from the inheritance.", "Yeah, nah it's difficult dealing with mental health with addiction on top of it. I wouldn't worry about it too much now that you've claimed it. You would've lost the house had he stayed in it. It was a difficult decision but it had to be made.", "Look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself if you *seriously* think that your mother would want you to kick your brother out high and dry without anything *from her*.\n\nThere may not be a will, but let's not pretend for one second you don't know what your mother's *wishes* would have been. Doing what you want purely because its the most convenient and beneficial for you is an abuse of your power as executor. Not only does that make you an AH, I think it spits into the memory of who your mother would have thought you were.", "I commented above, this is actually a very common law in many european countries. But you can't just claim the house, you need to take your brother to court and the judge will decide how the inheritance will be devided, and the donation will \"count\" towards your brother's share. But there is absolutely no way this was resolved in a couple of months, inheritance disputes take a very long time. Do you mean that you have filed a suit against your brother? If so, don't count on your inheritance yet, you don't know what the court ruling will be like; if, say, the property donated to your brother was lower in value than the house, he will still get a share in the house. And I am surprised he was evicted? Maybe you mean that you served him the suit claiming the house?", "No offense, but I find this whole situation (and especially the timeline) very unlikely. How did you \"claim\" the house?  You can't evict your brother just by claiming the house should only go to you, you need to go to court for it. How was this resolved in a couple of months?\n\nIn my country also, if a parent dies and has donated significant property to one of the children, this donation is counted as part of their share in the inheritance, so that part I believe. But there is usually either a settlement or a trial, to determine how much each property is worth and whether the donation covers the whole share.", "Yes, I figured as such. Don\u2019t worry about what they have to say. They are just upset that they have to figure out what to do with your brother now. Oh well. Sucks for them. Live your life and don\u2019t look back. I know your Mother is looking down at you and is proud of you. Good luck to you.", "[deleted]", "None of that matters. You know that was from your dad, not your mum, and you keep insisting that you don't care about what your dad or his money. Well, clearly you do.\n\nThis is about your brother and what your mother would have wanted him to have *from her*.\n\nYou are not asking whether you're legally in the clear. You're asking if your an AH. Your ethical responsibility was taking care of your mother's affairs. She had two children she loved and let live with her, and you've taken away everything that was hers that she would have wanted shared between you both.", "I mean, that's fair, but I also don't think my mom would be happy by her house becoming a crackhouse, or my brother claiming it as his own and refusing an agreement.\n\nAnd that's not talking about the abuse and the rage fits he's gone on against me.\n\nLike, I accept the assessment, and I get I am an asshole, but I just can't deal with it anymore. I just want peace.", "Honestly, if you've read OP's comments, I'd say it's rather easy to since brother is violent towards her and mom, inheriting all of the father's property and currently has several in his name, and constantly reminding her that he's going to get everything. Brother is set up and fine; OP is not.\n\nOP gave brother a month to accept an offer to buy him out, which she did not need to do and more than generous. Brother decided to play games. It also sounds like father had a lot of control over the mother financially, and I can't imagine she'd be ok with leaving one child with nothing overall. If she is OK with that, then, honestly, I don't care about her wishes and nor should OP.", "sorry, I might not have used the best words, English is not my first language, Im copying some part of another comment I just did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>there wasn't a trial.

And honestly, neither did I. But I was open to that idea, I offered to buy it, to try and sell it to someone from the family maybe so it stays somewhat close, but he refused everything.

The property he got in life as a donation is like a form of inheritance in advance, which is then subtracted from the post-mortem will.\n\nConsidering it\u2019s of the same value, the full legal claim to the house is indisputable if I want to claim it, and after his refusal to every one of my negotiations, I just went for it.", "The legal procedure for that would take years and money that I don\u2019t have.

From a legal standpoint, that property was never my father\u2019s in name, and he has too much on his plate to come out and claim it was his because that would get him investigated for a lot of shady shit.", "So my brother isn't greedy for trying to get all of my father's properties and the entirety of the only thing I have a claim to?

If he doesn\u2019t let my father drag him into his legal trouble now he should be set for life, but my brother hasn\u2019t worked a day in his life, so having several properties transferred from my father might be a bit sus. \n\nI hope he\u2019s okay.
