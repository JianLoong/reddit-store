Her proposal is that you take on ongoing costs for a home that you cannot sell, cannot rent out to anyone else, and cannot exclusively occupy?  Why would anyone agree to that?  It's an obvious money pit!\n\nShe needs to speak to an estate attorney about the right way to set this up, but I wouldn't agree to anything that didn't have a clear-cut end date (brother has X years to buy you out) or didn't allow you with an exit that would allow you to recoup your money.  I would never pay any costs towards a house I could not freely rent, occupy, or sell.  If he gets to live there, he should be covering ALL costs (including maintenance) while he resides there plus rent to you for your half, and there should be conditions under which you are able to force the sale even if he is not agreeable.\n\nShe doesn't have to leave you the house at all.  She can leave the whole thing to your brother, and he can be solely on the hook for all house-related costs.  But asking you to bear 50% of the financial risk and burden of the house while your brother gets to control it is a poor move financially for you.", "NTA -  on these situations I think it\u2019s best to choose one of these two options:\n\n1) Sell the house.  Each of you take half of the proceeds.  Your brother can use the proceeds as a down payment on a smaller affordable house for himself or put the money into savings and rent an apartment .\n2) Get an appraisal of the house.  Your brother can get a mortgage for 50% of the appraised value and buy out your half.\n\nThe option where he lives there doesn\u2019t benefit you at all IMO.  You could die before he ever decides to move out and never receive  any financial benefit from the house.", "NTA. This is a poorly thought out plan & needs proper non-Reddit advice. \n\nAlso - you\u2019ve only mentioned that your brother never left home, has no plans for his future, and doesn\u2019t earn much. \n\nDoes he do an adult\u2019s worth of care & maintenance around the house - or would that fall to you too?\n\nSo it\u2019s potentially not just about you subsidising the cost of living - but basically parenting him so that the house doesn\u2019t depreciate excessively from lack of maintenance. \n\nYou would be financially & emotionally better off if you let your mum give the entire house to your brother & disinherit you completely. \n\nShe is being (hopefully unintentionally) dishonest in telling herself that she is giving you any kind of \u201cgift\u201d with this inheritance plan. She is giving you obligation & stress, with a very, very, very low likelihood that you will ever see a penny from the house for yourself.", "And how long are you expecting to financially support your brother in this arrangement? If he can\u2019t afford to pay for the entire amount of tax and insurance how does she expect him to pay the rent and upkeep on the home? Are you supposed to act as his landlord in order to protect your share? Further, when and how do you get your share of the estate? If there is no mechanism for you to realize your inheritance then all your mother is doing is passing the responsibility for your brother\u2019s care onto you. \n\nYour brother\u2019s best chance to own his own home is probably selling the home and splitting the profits. That\u2019s reasonable and fair. Your mom\u2019s option is a terrible trap for both her children. \n\nNTA", "Nta. Your mother can do what she wants with her house - but she cannot control what you do with your money. Your mother is wanting to force you to basically being a partial landlord to your brother whether you want that role or not.", "What is supposed to happen if the house has a major issue like say a new roof?", "Info:\n\nPay rent for fair market valve - to whom? Do you get to keep that money? \n\nAnd can he afford fair market value?  I don't think so, so it's a non-issue because he wont be able to live up to the terms anyway. \n\nAlso, when are you to be getting your share of the proceeds? \n\nWhat if he pays the agreement for a short time then decides he wants to sell/move, does he feel entitled to a bigger share of the split once it's sold?", "NTA\n\nOnly way brother can stay in the house without OP subsidizing it is if mother has other assets she is putting into a trust to cover other half of taxes, insurance plus maintenance repairs or if they were to get roommates to live with the brother to cover the expenses he can't.\n\nOtherwise OP is funneling money into a house they are never allowed to sell and don't want to live in.  Doesn't seem like anything benefits OP.", "NTA. While this all sounds great as we know things can go wrong at any time leaving you holding the financial bag on this. If he is going to live there then he should be paying 100% of the costs including the taxes. You aren't living there so why should you pay for your living arrangements and half of his? Also if he gets roommates to help him pay the bills then that can also go sideways leaving him with additional issues.\n\nI think the way to go is to allow your brother a year to live there while you both clear the house and tie up loose ends after your mother passes. Then sell and split the money. That'll give your brother some money to figure out what happens next. \n\nOn a side note your mom did a poor job setting your brother up for a life as a self reliant functional adult.", "NTA what\u2019s in this for you? Just paying?? This makes no sense at all. Unless of course mommy wants her baby boy supported forever by you? Lol", "Hey mom do you favor your son that is dependent over your daughter who is independent? Why should she be her brother's keeper and bank? Maybe I don't know tell Sonny boy to grow up and pay for himself.  Usually, parents leave their children an equal inheritance. Not a responsibility such as taking care of your brother. I know when my MIL passes that this will probably happen to my husband and me. The resentment is already there between my husband towards his nonfunctioning sister (and there is nothing wrong with her).  That will be the relationship that YOU create amongst your children.", "NTA. She is not entitled to dictate what you do and what you own after her passing.  She can put the house in a trust for the benefit of your brother or she could dispose however she wants.  But if she bequeaths you half, that\u2019s yours to sell or dispose how you wish.  Bro is a grown up.  You are not his daddy.", "~~NAH~~\n\nMy initial thought was to ask for clarification on whose name the house would be in. If she leaves the house in your name this sounds like a fair deal....But only if you agree to it. Realistically, even if that was the case, it sounds like you would have a tenant that you would at least feel obligated to rent to even if he didn't hold up his end of the bargain. This is a terrible proposal that would be bad even if you didn't already disagree with it. It'll only drive a further wedge between you and your brother.\n\nEdit: that was supposed to be NTA", "Just because your mom has enabled your brother does not mean you have to.\n\nNTA", "INFO: Is she willing to just leave your brother the house? I wouldn\u2019t want any part of owning that house with anyone else. If I couldn\u2019t force a sale, I\u2019d rather just be left out than deal with the hassle of owning property I don\u2019t want.", "NTA.  Even if the rent he would pay you cover what she proposes you pay (taxes & insurance), it still leaves the question of who is responsible for the upkeep.  New roof, sewer lines, electrical and plumbing can be outrageously expensive.  Personally I\u2019d walk away without a penny rather than get sucked into what may become a money pit for you.", "NTA. This is incredibly messy and you are not protected should brother decide he suddenly does not want to pay anything at all.", "NTA. If she wants him to have the house, she should leave him the house. Then let him deal with paying for the expenses of living there.", "NTA. Your mother's plan doesn't make any sense. The house sounds more like your brother's inheritance than yours because he gets to live there, doesn't fully pay for it, and you can't sell it. It really doesn't benefit you at all. Your mother has been enabling your brother for years and now she wants you to do the same. She's being unfair to you. And I bet your brother won't pay rent to you regularly or at all.", "INFO: As long as he lives there this estate property value will not be liquidated and split between you and your brother, correct? In addition, you are requested to supplement his housing? Would he be paying full rent, market value for the entire house? If he cannot afford this then how will this obligation be met?", "INFO: If she just outright leaves the house to your brother, would you object to that?\n\nAlso, is what she\u2019s proposing that she will leave the house fully in your name, but he gets to stay there and pay rent and you two just split the other costs? Because honestly that sounds pretty fair to me. Or is she saying you\u2019ll both own it, but he\u2019ll pay you rent?", "NTA, as you said in your title - your mother wants you to subsidize your brothers lifestyle, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ok for her to ask of you. From your comments, you seem remarkably un resentful of the fact that your mother over coddled your brother and seems to want you to do the same for him. I don\u2019t know that I would feel the same in your shoes. Have you ever asked her if - instead of making your life difficult in the future - she instead forced your brother to do more? To work more, to pay more rent or even to move out? Why does she \u201chelp\u201d him like this? In any case, I would not accept that inheritance, if it should fall that way. Refuse it, or tell her clearly to just leave it to your brother - whatever happens after that is not your fault. I\u2019m sorry but there is too much codependence here - your brother is a fully functioning adult who lives this way because he is allowed to.", "NTA. When my grandparents passed away, their estate was willed to my uncle, my mom, and my aunt. It got...messy. My mom didn't want the house. But uncle and aunt would routinely call mom in a classic case of he said/she said. It tore the three of them apart. And it wasn't until my uncle bought out both my mom and my aunt that things started getting better. Her solution will cause a rift (if there's not already one between you and your brother) that may be irreparable.", "NTA - this is a lawsuit waiting too happen.", "That\u2019s a court case in the making. Sell the house and split it.", "Why is he not able to to fully support himself? Is he disabled?", "Honest question: what is behind your brothers failure to launch?\n\nDoes he have some sort of disability? \nWill he need help beyond financial as he gets older?", "NTA. You 2 also need to discuss who pays for maintenance and repairs. If you both own the house, it really should be divided in half. But you said he can't afford even half of market rate rent. If you don't need his rent, maybe that is held to go toward his part of the maintenance and repairs? What happens if he wants to have roommates? Who gets the money? Who pays if they damage anything? Who runs backgrounds? There are a lot of details you 2 need to work thru. Also, if you both own half, what happens later when you 2 can't agree what to do on something? What happens if he can't or doesn't pay?", "NTA but why don't you just set rent as an amount that covers your share of the asset at 100% of the property taxes. You could then pay the check for the taxes (to make sure they are paid), but he will effectively cover the full amount.", "NTA, I think it would honestly be in the brothers interest, some fledglings need to be pushed out of the nest.  You\u2019re correct that you\u2019d be subsidizing your brother\u2019s life. You\u2019ll end up paying half of repairs, maintaining the house, major appliances, etc. I\u2019d rather sell the house and invest the money.", "NTA at all and this will never work out.  What happens if your brother decides not to pay rent or defaults on the taxes or doesn't pay the insurance.  He's lived with mom all his life and is used to her taking care of him.  Not to be mean but I can see him wanting you to take care of him moving forward. Another thing that wasn't addressed is repairs. Who is going to be responsible for paying to put a new roof on when the time comes or replacing flooring when the water heater leaks (it happens to the best of us).  I think mom needs to start making big brother be a more responsible adult.", "NTA  If she wants to give him the house that's one thing.  But expecting you to pay half of the taxes and insurance is quite another.  What are the chances your brother will actually pay the other half + pay you rent?  What recourse will you have if he doesn't pay.  You're totally right that you shouldn't have to subsidize his cost of living in perpetuity.", "NTA if she wants him to have them let him have it but you're not going to pay to care for him.", "NAH. Your mother wants to take care of your brother, but wants you to also benefit from the house. The problem is you and brother are close in age, so you likely won\u2019t get any benefit from the house long term., and would end up subsiding you brother, who will get all the benefit. I suspect she also wants you involved so that he doesn\u2019t blow the house as his inheritance. \n\nIn her shoes (and subject to estate tax laws where you live), I would give brother a limited number of years to live in the house with an option to buy your interest. After say, 2 years, the house is to be sold. If she has other assets she could equalise the estate by giving you more of those assets and leave him the house.", "INFO: am I understanding right that you get ownership of a house without a mortgage payment, a monthly rent income, and have to pay only half of the cost of ownership (taxes and insurance)?\n\nI'm trying to figure out where you're subsidizing him by paying you rent every month?", ">(1) he pay rent to me at fair market value and (2) I pay for half of the property taxes and half of the homeowner\u2019s insurance while he pays for the other half.\n\n\n\nHow is that subsidizing his living?

I'm not exactly a fan of the idea you should subsidize your brother just because he refuses to aspire to better things.\n\nThat said, I'd consider renting the other rooms in the house as a shared accomodations unit if possible. It could actually make up for your part of the cost if you did go along with this plan, and also make a little profit.", "It is a stupid idea, because you can't really do anything with your \"half\" of the house. You aren't going to move back in with your brother, and if you leave it empty he basically gets the house to himself forever. HOWEVER, even if it's a stupid plan, it's her plan. It's not your decision what happens with any of her stuff. It's her house and her money. She can give it all to charity or leave it to her mailman, if she is of sound mind. You aren't entitled to anything, other than whatever she decides, for whatever reason she decides. YTA for being pushy with someone else's will. \n\nThe way to make the outcome more sensible, is to wait until after she dies, get your half of the house you can't live in, and convince your brother to buy your half by taking out a mortgage. The payments on a 50% loan to value house are likely to be small, and even someone with bad credit would get the loan. He would save the cost of rent. Plus, you would have the threat that if he doesn't agree, you can rent out the other rooms in the house, maybe to people he really doesn't like. lol", "YTA. If you own half the home, it's reasonable for you to pay half the insurance and taxes.\r  \n\r  \nWhat's apparently been left up in the air is the important question of what happens if he fails to pay the rent or his share of insurance and taxes. Also, the upkeep should be similarly divided between brother and sister.", "YTA.  Your brother appears to be dysfunctional.  He still lives in the family home.  You want to kick him out and sell the house for some money you say you don't need? Why not let him live there and collect the market rate rent?

If I were her, considering your attitude, I'd just leave the house to your brother, so you couldn't force him to be homeless.  Or leave him a life estate (he gets to live there until he dies), then if you're still alive you can have it after he's gone.\n\nBTW, I'm an actual adult and a homeowner.

It's really selfish to tell her what she can and can't do with what she has to pass down after she dies!", "YTA", "It's your mum's estate, she can leave it to whoever she chooses. It looks like she's trying to come up with an arrangement where you don't get disinherited, but your brother doesn't get kicked out of the house because you force a sale.

Hopefully, she will be around for a long time to come, and this is purely hypothetical. YTA for getting cross about this and turning it into an all or nothing argument. She needs proper professional advice. Don't be surprised if you're not included in her thoughts in the future.", "YTA, your brother is disabled isn\u2019t he??

Your mother is splitting house ownership equally between 2 of you which is fair. This is when she is within her rights to just give the house to him only.", "Honestly, YTA. The house is paid in full by your mom. The conditions ensure that your brother will be paying a fair market value for staying to live there and pay half of the taxes - both are quite fair. You won't be subsidizing your brother, as he will be paying rent to live in a house that is half his; you might be missing on some investment opportunity if you sell the house and use your share of the capital.

The costs incurred may possibly outweigh any income from rent (if it's not market value), factoring in repairs/damage/unknowns. What is point in having an asset that you have no control over and can never liquidate. It's tokenism and I agree you are subsidizing your brother.\n\nNot only that but it is basically putting a strain on your relationship with your brother for life. It already sounds strained. It is introducing a power/responsibility dynamic between siblings that is unnecessary.\n\nThe suggestion of your brother buying you out over time is the best route. If he can't afford to maintain the house by himself, ie. all costs, then he is unable to afford it and therefore you are subsidizing him.\n\nSurely it is more beneficial to the brother to be able to live independently, within his means, rather than be dependent on you, FOR LIFE. If he can afford to buy you out over his working life then this is obviously much healthier for him too, to have a goal of owning a home and feel his efforts of earning money are getting him something rather than just feel like he owes him sibling some rent.\n\nAnd everyone needs to be honest, it sounds like there will be missed payments and maintenance costs.

The brother is not able to pay for ongoing upkeep of the house - the example OP gave was that OP would have to pay if it needed a new roof.  \n\nIt's also highly likely that brother won't be able to even pay his monthly \"rent\".  \n\nOP is likely to be stuck with no asset and all the bills here.  And let's be real - if brother hasn't figured out how to adult by now, he's never going to, so brother is going to be living in that house - while it either slowly rots around him or OP pays to maintain it - for the rest of his life.  Meaning OP will not see a dime out of whatever value the house may have by the time brother dies.\n\nThis is an awful and unfair situation to put OP in.  OP's mother is essentially forcing OP to be the parent to the irresponsible brother after the mother dies.

If your Mom is intent on subsidizing your under-achieving brother forever, it would make more sense for your Mom to leave the house to your brother entirely, and leave any other assets she may have to you to achieve some sort of equality (e.g. any jewelry, cash, or bonds). Or specify that your brother must buy you out within a certain period of time (e.g. but putting a mortgage on the property).", "Honestly, sounds like you\u2019d be better off if she just willed the whole house to him if it so important for him to stay there. Let him figure it out but don\u2019t shackle you to the financial mess it will become.

If the end result is you owning the house and making money off of it with the side bonus of your brother having a place to live, it\u2019s not too bad of a deal. \n\nINFO AGAIN: How is your brother going to be able to pay you rent if he can\u2019t afford to move out and rent anywhere else? If the assumption is that he\u2019ll pay way below market value then that might change how I\u2019d feel about it", "It sounds to me like it is a 90/10 arrangement. Your brother gets ALL the benefits of living there for very little costs. Meanwhile, you would be on the hook for any taxes and insurance he can't pay, any utilities he can't pay (because you can't have a house without heat in the winter, pipes will freeze), and ALL of the repairs. What is he going to do when a stove,  washer, dryer, refrigerator, or hot water tank breaks??? He's going to call you. What happens when he needs a 20k roof or sidewalk  needs replaced. It really sounds like this is going to put a big drain on your checkbook. Truthfully, if your brother can't afford to replace an appliance when it breaks, then he should look for an apartment or room to rent somewhere. That way, the landlord will be responsible for it. \n\nOn a side note, is your brother working full time??? If he is making high 30k a year, he is making less than $20 an hour (if it's full-time). Sounds like he might need a push to better his future. Maybe sell the house and pay for some college/trade school? Most community colleges have programs for adults with low income, so that a certification in something or associates degree is affordable. He's old enough that he needs to start planning for his own future. Because your mom won't be there forever to take care of him. What happens if he gets an illness or injury? Or wants to retire? He needs a job where he can put a few $ away. He won't survive on social security.\n\nEdit: I went and reread. He is 32. If he is pushed now to better his future, he will have time to save. He is still young enough to enter the workforce in a new career (vs. trying at 55 to enter a new career). Its not your job to take care of him in his adult years. Your mom would be doing him a favor by pushing him to improve things, not by \"giving\" him a house to live in because he isn't financially stable. Giving someone a house that isn't financially stable is one of the worst things a person can do. Eventually, that person will lose the house, either to taxes or because of lack of upkeep.", "She wants him to live in the house we grew up in.

This is a bad bad idea and a disaster waiting to happen.", "First, I love that you and your mom both wanted to post here and look at the comments together. That's pretty cool of both of you.\n\nI feel like a few big things are tangled up here and just want to name each.\n\n1. For whatever reasons, neither of you sees your brother (her son) as self-sufficient as an adult.\n2. You think the inheritance your mom leaves you and your brother should be fair to both of you, and you don't want to be permanently financially tied to your brother. Your mom wants to feel both that (1) her will seems fair and (2) that her home continues to be available to her son after she dies.\n\nThe easiest to address is what you think your inheritance SHOULD be, then whether your mom's plan is a good idea.\n\n1. You are not owed anything specific from your mom. Your mom does not have to meet your standard of 'fair'.\n2. However, it is really good and wise that you both are talking about this now. It seems like your mom would like to both achieve her goals AND take into account your feelings and interests.\n3. I'm going to mention that I lost both my parents two years ago. Most of the inheritance was easily divided through named beneficiaries of accounts. Their house (and its contents) is the only thing we siblings had to deal with together. We are very loving and supportive of one another but also very different and in very different life paths. And we have a relative who was living with my parents for a very long time (and who helped them a lot in the last few years) and who my parents informally expect us to continue provide housing for as long as she wants. For now, we are willing to continue to share ownership of the house while one sibling and the relative live in the house. I share this so you know, I'm somewhat in your role in the situation your mom is planning to create in her will. (Though my sibling who currently lives in the house has been fully self-sufficient for many years.)\n4. So Mom, I'm letting you know that co-ownership of an inherited property is not that smooth and easy even in a really collaborative and smooth family situation. Decisions about maintaining the house (and its value) and how much/who to hire for repairs/maintenance/improvements is cumbersome. In our case, a third sibling is the executor, so we all agree to abide by his decision if we don't all agree. It's not that easy to balance different priorities, preferences; keeping our good sibling relationships; and protecting our personal financial interests.\n5. I'm also going to mention some specific financial considerations. (1) Your mom may be paying reduced property taxes as a senior. They could go up significantly the year the property is listed in your (OP's) and your brother's name. (2) Home insurance is better when an owner resides in the house, but our insurance still went up a lot (not sure why) the following year. (3) The value of the property at the time of death becomes the new cost basis of the house. Housing prices really spiked last year. In your mom's scenario, you would not be free to time selling the house to maximize profit/minimize taxes. Since it would not be your primary residence, you would be taxed on any profit (sale price in excess of the value at the time of your mom's passing). Your brother, with the house being his primary home, would only be taxed on profit about $250,000.\n6. Another consideration would be who would inherit in the case of either you or your brother passing away? Would/can mom bequeath the house so that should one of you die, the other would become sole owner. Is that what your brother or you would want? What if one of you has/had a spouse or a child?\n7. This is a minor point, but your brother would probably also be inheriting the furniture and appliances in the house, along with the dishes and other things. To \"be fair,\" your mom would have to figure out what to give you to offset that value; or she would have to give up on telling herself that she was splitting things fairly.\n8. Bottom line: I personally think that it would be better if your mom's will did not put you in the position of being financially tied to your brother and this house when (1) it's not an easy thing and (2) you clearly don't want it.\n\nThe question that starts everything is why does your mom feel she needs to provide your brother with living in this particular home after her passing? Is it his financial limitations (even after he receives his inheritance)? His social/emotional constraints? Why do you feel it would be you subsidizing him?\n\n1. If your brother can afford rent, is it market rate or just a token amount? A token amount would explain why you see subsidy. Market rate begs the question of couldn't your brother then afford to live in a place of his own?\n2. Is brother not financially responsible? Not a comforting thought if you have to be tied to him that way. If he is financial responsible, then between his ability to pay rent (that your mom expects him to pay you) and proceeds he could receive from the sale of the house, he should be well equipped to live elsewhere.\n3. If there's a social/emotional constraint, then why can't he just get a loan to buy out your (OP's) share of the house and own it by himself?\n4. Has your brother expressed that he wants to remain in the house? and Why?\n\nI'm stopping here. Hope this gave you some good food for thought and conversation. I think the most important thing is that you are sharing your love and respect with each other now. Honestly, the rest is gravy. (and Mom, your son will end up living his life his way; what you give him can help him, but it won't protect him from everything, including whatever you may think he needs protecting from.) Good wishes to all of you.\n\nETA: After I commented, I saw some of your replies and need to add this RE: the idea of kicking him out of his childhood home.\n\n1. Most people his age do and HAVE ALREADY moved out of their childhood home.\n2. Staying in your parents' home after their death is so very often an emotional trap. It keeps the person living in a permanent museum to their parents. It keeps them from feeling that they can have any kind of a fresh start.\n3. It's hard to push someone out of the home they've been living in after their loved one passes. Because honestly, it can take a year or two to get to a place where one can make big changes from an emotionally sound place. IT IS MUCH LONGER when there's a lot of emotional baggage. That means either OP will have to suffer shared ownership longer while brother gets emotionally equipped to move on, or brother will have to suffer both the passing of his mother and a major move in a year or two from that. Frankly, it would be much more emotionally healthy for your mom to help your brother leave the house while she is alive and can be supportive as he adjusts to living on his own. Then when she passes, the only thing either you or your brother have to deal with is grieving her loss and selling the house and contents.\n4. Since it doesn't sound like brother is much help around the house, it also makes it much harder to manage things if your mom has prolonged health problems prior to her passing. He probably won't be of much help, but it will make it hard for her to use the house as an asset if she needs it to help cover the cost for her own care. (and a bunch of other complications that you can probably think of on your own). I do hope your mom finds a plan that is sound and works to everyone's benefit.", "Your mom not only knows about reddit but also this specific subreddit? ...okay.\n\nAnyway NTA, you don't have to agree to any estate plan you don't want to.", "NTA\n\nTo me, it looks like your mom wants to have her cake and eat it, while make you responsible for making the cake, crafting the cutlery, and cleaning up after.\n\nSo she would make you financially respaonsible for a house you cannot sell, rent out or move into.
