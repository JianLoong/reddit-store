Whatever it is that you're clinging to, let it go (because he clearly already has).  He's a spineless jerk for not telling you he's moving on and just letting you sit there to slowly figure it out yourself.  Do whatever you think will be most enjoyable... ghost him, roast him (on socials), or toast him (raise a glass and wish him well).  And have a fabulous birthday without him.", "NTA, you did nothing wrong. You\u2019re trying to communicate and he\u2019s shutting you down. That\u2019s no basis for a relationship. It might be time to reconsider staying with this guy", "I'm so sorry,  hon, but he's letting you know that he's no longer emotionally available.  You definitely deserve better than waiting with your phone in hand for a text that doesn't come.  Been there,  done that,  and it sucks.  Get a pint of ice cream, and a bottle of wine,  have a cry, and hopefully you'll eventually realize that you're so much better off without that kind of emotional torment.  It'll take a while,  but you'll get there.  *gentle hugs* you are definitely NTA.

Because it doesn't sound like there were any plans the two of you made, and I'd not be surprised if the plans he had with friends were preexisting. And if work is keeping him busy, it also may well be that he's still trying to balance multiple elements of his social life. So I'm not sure where the expectation reasonably came from on your part.", "I suspect that he was trying to quietly slip out the door on your relationship when he got \u201cbusy with work\u201d and he was hoping you\u2019d break up with him.\n\nYou know now where you stand with him.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s someone else. You need to cut him out of your life. Heal yourself and then move forward. If you accept this, you\u2019re telling yourself that this is all you\u2019re worth\u2026 I know you owe yourself more than this. My mom always said to me smile in the faces of those that believe they\u2019re better than you, it\u2019s the best revenge. So go and live a happy life. It\u2019s his loss after all. You\u2019ve got this, girl!", "it sounds like you have drifted apart. I'm really sorry but your relationship might be ending.", "He doesn\u2019t care about you and you should end this relationship because it\u2019s already dead.", "Like so many others here are stating: it's over. He doesn't have the balls to tell you he doesn't fancy you anymore, maybe he's waiting for you to take the hint and break up with him, so he doesn't have to. It's a cowards approach, but a very common one. Start planning your next chapter in life without him in it. Start getting over him today, so it doesn't hurt ad much when he finally makes the call. Or maybe he doesn't even call you, doesn't matter. Closure is not something you need from him, it comes from within. Don't ask yourself why it happened, it doesn't matter, The reason will likely just be stupid from your perspective anyways.", "To everyone who replied, thank you for being so supportive. I\u2019ve been miserable trying to think what else can be done on my part to make this better. And putting it out in words made me realise there very little i could do. \nLike most of you said, i should move on, i\u2019ll try my best. After-all 6 years of relationship isn\u2019t a small duration to get past so easily.

That hurts.  But it gives you a very clear message and that message is, break it off.  \n\nA man who once saw you nightly and then cut back to once a week -- this is when I would try to have a serious conversation.  Which you've tried to do to no avail.  \n\nRight now you need to respect yourself, know what you need and deserve in a relationship and read the room:  he is not in it.  He is nowhere to be found.  It's time to accept that it's over, allow yourself to be sad, and then when you're ready, have a much clearer sense of what your're looking for, and when to kick a partner who's drifting away to the curb.  Where this man belongs.\n\nYou might want to talk with a therapist.  It's a really hard time of year to break up, especially with your birthday looming, and having the support of a sensitive, insightful, and objective person could help you process all this in a way that helps build you back up.\n\nI'm so sorry.  But YWBTA if you pursued this man or did anything but accept that he's gone, not even taking his calls if he suddenly were to show up.  He''s demonstrated who he is and where he stands in this relationship, and how inconsiderate of you he is.  You deserve better.", "You spelt ex-boyfriend wrong", "He's checked out.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry to tell you but your relationship is over. Idk why he won\u2019t just break up with you but I\u2019ve heard of people that are so afraid of hurting someone\u2019s feelings by breaking up with them that they\u2019d rather do this and make the other person leave\u2026 as if that\u2019s any better.

It seems like he is just ignoring you until you break up with him, so then he isn't the 'bad guy'. \n\nYou're worth more than this.", "Your relationship is over. Move on.", "NTA, stop wasting your life on this bum.", "NTA. Sadly he\u2019s probably found someone/something else that takes priority over you and the relationship. Ask him to come get any of his belongings from your place and well, find a way to be okay. Relationships fizzle and better to heal now and give yourself permission to be happy then to cling to someone/something who doesn\u2019t make you feel important and emotionally satisfied.", "NTA. Dump him. Plain and simple. Childish behavior and performing under the already oh so set low bar will not be tolerated. Thank youuuu next", "NTA But sorry Hon, you don't have a boyfriend anymore, he's ghosting you for a reason. No communication even during the holidays? In his mind you two have broken up even if you haven't seen it yet. What he did was pretty crappy not being an adult and talking face to face about not wanting to be with you anymore. It may not have been anything you did, but this is where you are now. Don't count on him being around for your birthday.", "NTA. Sorry but, sounds like he may quite possibly seeing somone else and doesn't know how to tell you.", "Are you sure he's even your boyfriend anymore?", "NAH\n\n  \nAre you sure this is actually your bf, and not an ocassional sex partner?", "I think you need to move on with your life and stop hoping for and trying to force a situation that is clearly not working. Your efforts are not being reciprocated or appreciated, so cut your losses and wrap this up.", "I'm sorry and I hate to say it, but this is how some people break up with people, they ghost them, agree to things they really don't want to do and then don't come through etc. It's because deep down he wants to break up but doesn't have the balls to do it himself or be the bad guy so they pull this kind of crap. And BTW, you didn't do anything wrong, this is all him.", "NTA, but let's be real. Your relationship is over. Your so called boyfriend has moved on and so should you.", "Agreed", "Okay, so expected because the previous day we had a long conversation where I expressed what i felt. I told him I support his work (which by the way i wanted him to focus on for years and he just started). I told him i only expect one half day a week on the day he\u2019s free that we meet even if it\u2019s just over a coffee. Next day was his off. \nSecond, his plans were not pre planned. He goes for coffee everyday after work and made plans with friends on the spot at the coffee shop. \nHope that gives more insight?", "I\u2019m sorry you had to go through something like this. It hurts hard especially during the holidays. Thank you for saying this.", "The only problem here is, I\u2019ve communicated my expectations and feelings so clearly and calmly to him more times than i can count. This was the point when I couldn\u2019t figure out what else is there to do without being offensive still. \nI\u2019ve not been setting higher expectations, only reducing them with time. I was used to him doing so much more. I thought asking this much wasn\u2019t even necessary, it should naturally be the case. \nAs far as good morning texts go, I\u2019ve been doing those too. Update from this morning: he didn\u2019t.", "So for my clarification on this... so you said you wanted more time, but you didn't actually make any plans? And from what you're saying, it sounds like he's working 6 days a week and only has a single day a week free?", "It\u2019s painful but I\u2019m slowly coming to terms with it. Talking to friends and family about it, and sharing my experiences with others in similar situations have helped me greatly. \n\nIf you have people you trust, speak to them about it. That\u2019s been the biggest thing for me; letting my thoughts out somewhere I won\u2019t be judged. Whether it be trusted friends or strangers that can\u2019t do anything with the sensitive topics I share with them is very comforting instead of just carrying around that burden yourself", "Call him and flat out ask him these questions.  Don\u2019t hint or expect him to read your mind right now.  It seems like the relationship is over and he is comfortable living his life as it is now.   This way you know and get closure.", "He works in his family business. His off days depend on when he wants to take them, Plus Sundays. Sometimes he takes the whole week off and other days he working 6 days a week. \nYes, we didn\u2019t make a plan. However for the past many years, we\u2019ve been seeing each other on our off days"]}
