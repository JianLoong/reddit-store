We used to meet every other evening after work.. reduced to once a week on weekends when he got \u201cbusy with work\u201d. I\u2019ve been missing him and want to meet with him at least once a week, and expressed my expectations to him in a long heartfelt conversation. He seemed like he understood and agreed. The very next day was a weekend and I expected him to meet me, while he went drinking with his friends instead. I got super hurt and super mad but i still conveyed my feelings with simple words and not passive aggressively. I hoped he\u2019d talk to me and make it up to me afterwards, however he didn\u2019t care enough to even talk. I stopped talking to him next morning because that was all left to do to express how sad i felt, still hoping he would come around and make it better. It\u2019s been almost two weeks now, with nothing but a good morning text each day and no conversation at all. I\u2019m dying inside wondering what i did wrong that he didn\u2019t even care to get me to talk? How is he not feeling what I\u2019m feeling? How is he so okay with no talking and no seeing each other for three whole weeks? What in the world do i do?\n\nEdit: These two weeks of no communication include Christmas and New Years. And next week is my birthday.

You've been dating one of those passive \"good\" people who will never dump a person, just slowly ghost and annoy them until they get broken up with.

Also so some deep thinking about what drew you to this person and why you stayed, so you can learn for next time.

Whatever it is that you're clinging to, let it go (because he clearly already has).  He's a spineless jerk for not telling you he's moving on and just letting you sit there to slowly figure it out yourself.
