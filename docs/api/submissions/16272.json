It was a design i made myself of a moth in a geometric style, with moons going up the neck and down the spine. \nThe original plan was for my mom and i to both get a semi matching tattoo, where i get the full design and she gets just the moons on her neck. \nCloser to the actual tattoo date however, my mom started saying that she was going to get the full design. I tried asking her only to get the moons, but whenever i brought it up she would respond with \u201cno its okay, ill get the full thing.\u201d\n\nThe day of the tattoo came and being a full time student, I got mine and went home so i could sleep at a decent time. My mom got hers afterwards and payed for both as was agreed upon. \n\nWhen i saw hers the next day, i was outraged. She not only got the full design, she got it bigger and in full color, in a completely different (much more noticeable) location so that it could be a coverup for an old tattoo she had. \nI didn\u2019t say much. \n\nThe following days after the tattoos, whenever we would go out and people would complement my tattoo, before i got the chance to say anything she would jump in and show off her bigger better version, talking about how she got the same design just bigger and in color, while i just got it in black and white. Obviously people loved hers a bit more. \n\nI told my friend about the ordeal, and she told me i was being selfish, which I guess i can see. She said i was being ungrateful for my free tattoo, and that i should be happy that my mom has my art on her. \nIn part i understand, but im also upset that she went against my wishes with my design.

Without more context it\u2019s a little bit hard to say for sure. Honestly, it sounds like OPs mom might be a little narcissistic. \n\nI think it\u2019s sweet OPs mom wanted his art tattooed, but she could have done this with just the moons and OP flat out asked her not to do it, and she did it bigger and bolder. On top of that, any artist would probably be a little peeved if someone got their design as a tattoo without their permission.", "NTA - does she think you wanted her to get the full thing? When she's showing it off, does she mention you designed it? has she tried to upstage you in the past?", "NTA. Tattoos are intensely personal. Your mom is being pretty nasty, trying to perpetually upstage and outshine you. You may need to be prepared to go LC at some point, nit over the tattoo but over her personality.", "NTA- this was YOUR design, and you should be allowed to be upset that she used it against your wishes.\n\nWhile i get it can be sweet that she wanted your design on her. Its still not ok if this was against your okay'd use of it. \n\nEven if she did pay for yours and hers tattoo, she still took away a memorable moment from you having your own unique design. I find it insulting on your behalf that she also altered the design an lacks the understanding of how this takes away from your meaning and creativity of your creation. (Maybe its the artist in me thats more upset about this, as ive seen to many artworks ripped off) \n\nI do hope you can still look at your design and know that you have clearly the original concept and be proud that you still will have your true creation on you despite your mom having done this.", "NTA, this was your art that you'd designed, and she seems to be going out of her way to upstage you.    \n\n\nThat seems really odd.  I'm sorry that she did this to you.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, I forgot to add that friends did this with BOTH of my tattoos\u2026.one of which I designed as a remembrance of my dead dad. \nYa, you read that right. I designed a tat specially with things my dad loved\u2026and my \u201cBFF\u201d got an almost identical one. And cuz his is on his arm & mine is on my back, people as me if I got mine to match his. \n\nNeedless to say, we\u2019re not friends anymore. Got rid of that toxicity.", "I completely forgot to add this in- the reason i posted this today and not three months ago when we got said tattoos is because she recently got it expanded. \nShe added to the piece so now it fills basically her whole back. And i know i cant be upset about that, because the addition was kinda just like getting another tattoo to go with it, but it still irks me in a way. Especially since people are asking me if *I* got my tattoo to match *hers*", "NTA she stole a piece of art you created that was clearly really important to you. Shame on your mom. Especially because of the fact that people compliment your tattoo and she steals that moment from you to show off her own. That's so shitty and kinda narcissistic", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your design. She\u2019s come along and trumped your tattoo of your own design. It was supposed to a birthday gift to *you*, and she\u2019s made it all about *her* and disregarded your wishes in the process. That\u2019s really selfish behaviour.", "NTA. \n\nYour mother is competing with you out of jealousy or narcissism.", "Info: did you tell her you didn't want her to get the full one? Kind of depends on that really. She may have had in her head  about matching tattoos because she thought you wanted it", "NTA. It's your design and I understand why you hate it that your mother one upped you on your own thing.", "YTA\u2026 you had full control of what you wanted on your body, if you wanted colour or bigger you could have chosen that.  You also got a free tattoo and your mum kept telling you she\u2019ll do this, so it not a real surprise she followed through with what she said.\n\nSomeone might be inspired to get a similar tattoo after seeing yours too, that\u2019s life! As long as you\u2019re happy with what you placed on your body that\u2019s all that matters really. \n\nAlso as annoying as it is now your mum won\u2019t be around you forever, you might cherish the shared art as you get older and more distant from your mum PLUS most people you meet will never see your mum\u2019s tattoo.", "Edit: YTA -  the time to discuss/complain was before getting the tattoos. It doesn't sound like boundaries were clear. If they were and she refused your request, you should have refused to get the tattoo. Why surprisw afterwards?", "NAH.\n\n\nI think this is just a mom wanting to show her kid that she's proud of her/her artwork.\nAs your kids get older you want to connect with them more. I think she just saw this as a grand gesture of her love for you and that she's proud.\n\n\nTattoos are a form of expression, she wanted color because she likes color, and I think she got it bigger to literally magnify her love for your art and that you match.\n\n\nI understand that you had a certain vision of your piece and how to match it, that's totally ok too.\nHowever I think maybe saying something more direct like \"I want our tattoos to be exactly the same, otherwise we're technically not matching.\" Would have helped your cause.\n\n\nMy siblings and I all have a matching tattoo, but we all got it in different color schemes/themes, and it all matches but also feels special/personal to the individual.\n\n\nIts ok to feel the way you do, but in the grand scheme of things, this wont matter after awhile. Someday she wont be around, and youll miss that colorful tattoo. Try to show your momma some appreciation for getting it for you and bond over it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't get to decide what is ok for me. \n\nArt theft is not a joke, you might be entitled to legel compensation. NTA", "OP you\u2019re NTA but you should have either paid for yours on your own and told the artist it was not to be used again, especially on your mom, or you should have asked her to get you a gift certificate to the shop.\n\nEither way it should have been communicated to the artist that yours was to be the only version. But it sounds like you didn\u2019t or weren\u2019t able to communicate with your mom more clearly about what you wanted. Though she does sound a bit \u201clook at me!\u201d.", "When i brought the idea up to her, it was always that she would get the moons. She knew this, and i know she knew because when she would tell her friends about our plans she would say specifically that she was getting the moons. \nWhen she decided that she wanted it to be a coverup is where im guessing she made up her mind. I tried telling her that i only wanted her to get the moons, but she would get upset or just flat out tell me no, she was getting the full thing. eventually she stopped talking about it and i figured she went back to the moons idea but i found out only after she got her ink that i was so very wrong", "and yes she has a habit of doing so. Shes always tried to use my accomplishments to be able to bring up how she got more when she was my age. Shes also obsessed with telling anyone and everyone that she was skinner than me when she was my age. No matter what i say to this woman she is relentless.", "Nta.  Next time just say \u201c Please excuse her, she got jealous over the attention I got for my original art work\u201d", "i did yes. She would always bounce back with \u201cbut i like the full design. why cant i just get that?\u201d or \u201cno i think ill stick with the full thing that way we can really be matching.\u201d no matter what i told her she didnt seem to grasp how i felt about it", "She stated in the post and another comment that she asked her to only get the moons. But the mother rejected that statement.", "It\u2019s a bit fricking different when you did the design yourself!", "Also she told you she was going with the full design. You should have told her that your moth design was for you alone, if it was such a big issue for you.", "Thank you for this perspective, ill try to keep this in mind.", "Why did you think she went back with the moons idea when she said she would get the full design? Did she say anything to suggest that?", "that is exhausting. i'm sorry. \n\nalso to the people saying \"that's life, get over it\", tattoo theft is a real thing and very frowned upon in the body modification world. It's common knowledge, you don't lift designs from other people, other artists, other designers. it's bad etiquette. I guess since the artist thought it was a matching tattoo and she was paying, they had to do what she wanted. still sucks though. \n\nI have a few tattoos that I designed myself, if someone copied them i'd be so pissed.", "NTA. You're supposed to want your kids to do/be better than you were. She is too self absorbed to get that. That's why she tries to upstage you.

If i made a design and someone told me outright multiple times they were going to use it without my permission, I would make it clear that this was unacceptable and make sure they fully understood that I would be angry if they did so. I'm not sure that happened here.", "No, i didnt think to say that :/ i was very excited to get ink done and i was partially afraid she would back out of her promise if i did something to upset her", "\"No it's ok\" is not an answer to \"Don't get this\". You then say, I no longer want the tattoo then if you're going to use my design without my permission.\n\nOP knew her mum was getting the full design. Why complain after?", "Yes, particiular the \"tried asking\" phrase. I was not saying to ask or to try to ask. Instead she should have established a clear boundary. When her mum answered that she'll get the full design OP should have said:\n\"I really wanted the moth design for myself. It would make me unhappy if you get it too. I won't get the tattoo if you get it too.\n\nThat doesn't sound like what was said to me. If it was, I'll update my decision but sounds less direct to me.\n\nEdit: also \"no it's ok\" answer doesn't suggest a request was made but a question.", "Seeing someone open to reassessing their judgment, instead of doubling down, is always worthy of respect.

OP made it very clear, but has a mother who likes to upstage and needs attention.", "Or... OP didn't communicate that directly and her mum didn't know how important it was to her.\n\nIf there's history, there's even MORE reason to make it 100% clear that she would not get the tattoo in that case. Why go through with it when the mum has said multiple times she's getting the full design?", "You reread. OP hasn't explained why she went through with the tattoo despite her mum saying repeatedly that she would get the full design. I would be angry at that point and refused the tattoo.\n\nGoing through with a free tattoo and then being surprised that her mum did precisely what she said whe would do is a little odd and makes me think it wasn't as clear as OP is suggesting."]}
