She works in musical theatre, with waitressing when she can't find work, so her income isn't always consistent and can be low sometimes. I work in a well paid industry, and earn a very good amount.\n\nMy boyfriend (m26) moved in with us a couple months ago. The rent is split three ways equally. It's a nice, two bedroom flat in Central London, with rent I could stretch to afford by myself on my salary.\n\nSince my sister doesn't earn enough to cover the whole rent, she pays a set amount and I cover the rest of her third. In return, she does household chores for me. The way we view it is it's like another job she has, except the money goes directly to pay her rent. It's a situation we're both very happy with.\n\nWhen my boyfriend moved in, we talked about rent and it made sense to split it three ways. He never asked how my sister could pay it. He earns a decent amount, but less than me due to the nature of the career he's in where it takes a few more years to reach higher pay. The rent's not great for his salary, but not unaffordable.\n\nThe other day, my sister asked my boyfriend to scan over her budgeting and check for any obvious mistakes. He noticed that she payed less rent than him and asked why, so she explained the arrangement we have together. He apparently got all weird and said how he thought our parents were paying her rent or something (our parents aren't poor by any means, but there not 'pay central London rent on top of our own expenses' kind of rich).\n\nWhen I got home, he asked my about it and I explained the same as my sister did. He then got annoyed since I don't accommodate for him earning less than me, and how paying less would really help his finances. I basically said that if he wanted to pay less rent, he could move out, and that I'm not lowering his share of the rent. He replied that it's unfair I cover some of my sister's rent but none of his. I didn't really know what to say, so I told him that he wasn't my sister and maybe it is unfair that my sister has a lower rent, but paying my sister's rent and his rent were two very different things.\n\nHe got all pissy about it and left, and now his mates are texing me saying I'm not supporting him and that I'm clearly not commited to the relationship and basically that I'm being an ass. We haven't even been together that long, so to be honest I'm not that commited to the relationship. I feel like I'm not the asshole in this situation, but his friends' opinions are really throwing me off.", "created_utc": 1678577317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11oyn5x/aita_for_helping_my_sister_financially_and_not_my/", "score": 329, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Family is in it for the long haul with you (whether by birth or by choice), bf is yet to be determined.\n\nHowever, if your bf is paying more in rent because he's living in a location that you chose based on your salary, I think he's reasonable (though not objectively right) to ask for a proportional split rather than 50/50 (of your expenses as a couple) and on that I'd go N A H. This is a more controversial/debatable topic, but I personally think that where there's a significant difference in income, the lower earner shouldn't be losing money in order to date the higher earner. It makes it trickier that you're not all that committed, and I think it's fair in your case to insist on leaving things the way they are.\n\nBad sign that his friends are hassling you, though. I might vent to/seek advice from my friends, but they would never overstep like that.

And his friends probably didn't get the entire story.\n\nNTA and break up as soon as possible", "NTA.\n\nThe minute his 'mates\" entered the conversation to browbeat you, the conversation was over.\n\nTell him he pays what was agreed.  If he doesn't like it, leave.  If his mates try to talk to you again because he thinks crowdsourcing arguments is z smart move, he us out.", "NTA. 1/3 of rent is cheaper than 100% of rent. His choice on what he wants to pay. The agreement between you and your sister is none of his or his friends business. Tell his friends that your ex can move in with them if they think there is a problem, then block his friends.", "Your sister has her own room, and your bf does not, but he pays 1/3, so he's actually also subsidizing her. I can understand him getting upset, and I'd guess it's more because this made him realize the arrangement actually is unfair to him than because he thinks you should be supporting him. YTA for not being upfront with him about the full arrangement before he moved in.", "NTA and run from anyone who sics their friends on you like that", "NTA. Girl, this is a big red flag. Sounds like he\u2019s insecure that you make more than him. The deal you and your sister have makes total sense to me, and him trying to control your money is gross.", "NTA. He\u2019s a big boy, he can take care of himself.", "NTA.\n\nHe's paying for 1/3 of the rent as 1 out of 3 tenants.\n\nSounds like he's trying to milk you for all your worth.\n\nIt's like dude..... grow a pair. Your BF sounds pathetic", "NTA\n\nIt is YOUR money and if you choose to burn it up, it is none of his business.\n\nHe is paying one third as is your sister technically. \n\nWhat difference does it make whether you \\*subsdize\\* her rent versus her parents. \n\nIf he were paying more than one third and she were paying less, he would be correct in terms of there not being equity but she is paying the same only she is technically being paid by you to do some household chores - which actually benefits him ironically.\n\nI would hope that most people would feel that this kind of arrangement with one's sibling - fair to both is appropriate and that one's boyfriend is not entitled to one's money unless the relationship becomes an economic unit (i.e marriage or equivalent) and even then most couples retain some amount of their income as their own to spend as they see fit.", "NTA - but why did you move him in if you\u2019re not committed to the relationship ?        \nDon\u2019t suggest he move out, make him move out.       \nHe wants you to support him, it\u2019s not your responsibility", "NTA - your boyfriend is entitled and immature, time to boot him out. \n\nYour rent agreements with your sister are your business.  He involved his friends in this and they are. Or acting you?  What a whiny child, why are you dating this person?", "Her sister does household chores to earn the portion of rent that's paid for her. The boyfriend isn't considering that. He's probably been enjoying the sister doing everything around the house though.", "Also, lots of people split bills proportion to income. It\u2019s not the only way, but it is considered a fair way by many. Also, does the sister get her own room and OP and bf share a room. That doesn\u2019t seem like it should be an equal divide. Maybe bf should move out and find a place that is more affordable for him.\n\nHis friends contacting OP is not cool though.", "That was the way he suggested it. My sister's room is smaller so it seemed fair.", "I didn't read that he was complaining about not getting to do chores.\n\nSo the existing agreement was half and what you can afford plus the housework.\n\nHe needed a place to stay so he offered to pay a third.\n\nIf he doesn't think it's fair anymore he should look for a cheaper option, one with no live in maid or girlfriend.\n\nWhat he shouldn't do is be immature and try to involve his friends to berate her for taking care of her little sister.", "I think you should end it sooner. He has a lot of nerve having his friends badgering you. He's immature and narcissistic.", "Agreed, good luck!", "Well, he can go somewhere with his own room", "allright. If your room is a better room than I can understand the difference turning into a 3-way split.\n\n\nBy the way you will never be the AH for helping anyone, much less your little sister. Your boyfriend is acting entitled.\n\n\nNTA", "Is half of what the cost would be if you were splitting the bigger bedroom\u2019s rent greater than 1/3 of the rent? Hopefully that makes sense lol", "Is the master bedroom worth 2/3 of rent and the small bedroom worth 1/3?\n\nIn most rental situations I've been in the answer is yes. The room that is big enough for two people is worth more than the room that is only big enough for one person. If it has a private bathroom it is worth even more.", "I know that. The solution for this guy is for the girlfriend to subsidize both the sister and him. They are missing the logic in that he wants to sleep with his girlfriend. I just wonder if he would be willing to pay half the rent to have his own room and no girlfriend.\n\nIf not then no he doesn't get to pay a quarter and his girlfriend pay a quarter. The sister can't afford half and becomes homeless? \n\nAnd then they both have to pay half and do the housework. \n\nAnd OP made her sister homeless.\n\nOP you aren't an asshole. Save your sister and kick the boyfriend to the curb.", "I'm not saying the little sister should pay half. And I'm not saying he is entitled to pay 1/4 of the rent either. I was just pointing out that 1/3 is not the fair deal other commenters are pointing out to be but at the end of the day he was offered a stay by paying 1/3 and he accepted it. He should not complain about who his girlfriend is helping more especially being her sister.", "Except...sister is doing housework and sounds like he isn't.  What is that worth towards the rent he pays?", "Well, he can move out and pay for his own place if it\u2019s unfair. Then he gets his own room, no sharing with his girlfriend.", "The thing is, where is the additional money for the younger sister going to come from? The OP chose to subsidize her younger sister so they could live together. Is the OP going to subsidize the boyfriend too? It sounds like OP is supportive of her sister\u2019s career goals which in theatre includes some time at low pay till you advance to better jobs. It\u2019s kind of OP to help her sister like this.", "The thing is most two bedrooms aren't two master bedrooms. Usually it's one big bedroom (master) and a small bedroom (child).\n\nNow if the boyfriend and the girlfriend have the small bedroom and the sister has the master bedroom then I agree that's an idiotic split. \n\nBut I bet the couple have the master bedroom. It probably even has a private bathroom. I've lived with roommates before. The size of the bedroom matters. I've paid $500 for the small bedroom while a couple paid $1,000 for the master bedroom with private bath. \n\nIt isn't an idiotic unfair split.", "OP doesn't mention her boyfriend doesn't do housework.\n\n\n She just mentions her sister does (extra) housework to cover her rent (1/3 of total which she pays a smaller percentage in money)\n\n\nAnyways I don't understand what is your point", "Some posts suggest the boyfriend should pay less because he shares a room. I am pointing out that there are other factors to be considered.", "It's fine to financially treat your boyfriend as a roommate but if this was a roommate situation, the roommate in a shared room would pay less than the roommate who gets her own room. This situation is unfair to him.\n\nBy paying a third of rent for less than a third of the space so your sister can pay pittance for half the bedrooms, he is also subsidizing her lifestyle. \n\nHis mates shouldn't be texting you about this though. This unfair situation isn't their business. It's his to deal with as he sees fit (I would advise him to find a new place and dump you). He is 26 years old and should be discussing it with you two of he finds it unfair. \n\nESH", "Nta", "NTA his friends are and so is he.", "NTA. Its your money, you get to spend it how you want.", "NTA\n\nLet him take his ass to these friends house to live with, maybe they'll subsidize his rent.", "Would it make your boyfriend happier if sister paid you a third and then you paid her for the chores she did?", "If you and your Sister are both happy with your arrangement, then it's nobody's business. Your bf sounds like an ass. Also his friends, what's up with them writing you, he cant stand for himself? NTA", "Yikes. I\u2019d be thinking about moving on. So many red flags. Why does you working out something with your sister have anything to do with him? He can go clean someone else\u2019s home and use the $ to pay his rent. No need to be jealous. What a weird sense of entitlement?? \n\nAlso- he agreed to the rent.", "So NTA. But you would be if you keep letting him live there. If you\u2019re not \u2018that committed\u2019 then drop the weight sooner rather than later. His entitlement to receiving the same kind of deal as your FAMILY member whom you\u2019ve know all your life is a little ridiculous", "nta ... your boyfriend expects you to pay for him aswell thats crazy you are not even married its also none of his business what you do with your own money", "NTA but the red flag here is that he\u2019s getting other people to contact you about this? Big friggin yikes to me!", "NTA\n\nHis friends can house him for free if they're so bothered by him paying his share of the rent at your place.\n\nSounds like you and your sister have a system that works for you both. You don't have to tolerate that sort of behaviour from your bf.", "NTA. He\u2019s your boyfriend, you don\u2019t need to financially support him. Did he even offer another arrangement to work for his rent decrease like your sister did? Or does he just want to take advantage of you?", "NTA", "Doing extra chores for a reduced rent seems fair to me. Plenty of people trade services. I guess if you want to try to salvage the relationship, you could list the housework your sister does and figure out how much a maid service would cost for the same. But he probably doesn\u2019t consider that valid, even if he\u2019s also enjoying the results.\n\nNTA", "NTA he can move \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Your sister is family and does chores in exchange for the rent that you cover. \n\nYour boyfriend is a dude who recently moved in and just demanded a lot of stuff for free.

Your sister is working more than one job and doing her part by cleaning and helping you out.\n\nHe, however, WANTS to be a leech.    \n\nHe's not a keeper.  It's okay to break up with him and let him go back to living whereever he was living before.", "I understand him being annoyed at subsidizing your sister and you not telling him up front that\u2019s shitty sorry and that is what he is doing by paying a third if she isn\u2019t but then him storming off and getting his mates to harass you makes him suck. EHS should have told him upfront and his behavior sucks ass too.", "NTA, it seems like a good deal from your bfs point of view, too. Housework is a pain in the ass i'd happily pay extra for less stuff to do haha!", "This is ridiculous. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds far too entitled.", "Why stay with someone who so disrespects you that they think it\u2019s fair game to tattle on you to their friends? He\u2019s entitled and selfish.", "The fact that he told his mates about it and now they're getting involved makes him an even bigger A.  Your NTA here.", "I can\u2019t get over how he whined to his friends and they had the audacity to text you. It must be a generational age thing because my friends wouldn\u2019t dream of telling my SO that they\u2019re an asshole. \n\nYour sister sounds like a good person who works hard. I think it\u2019s great you guys have a wonderful relationship.", "\nIf your romantic relationship progresses, it's not unreasonable to split rent based on a percentage of income. I see this suggested all the time. \n\n\n\nDo you have a plan to address the financial inequality with your boyfriend if the relationship becomes more serious? Can you move to a less expensive area and so on?  \n\n\n\nFinances can break relationships. I hope you can work it out if you still want to.

It's really none of his business what arrangement she has with her sister. Her sister working for her doing household chores is absolutely fair, if it was any of the boyfriend's business. It's not her problem if he's strapped for cash, either. He's not her husband."]}
