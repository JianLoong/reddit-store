She works in musical theatre, with waitressing when she can't find work, so her income isn't always consistent and can be low sometimes. I work in a well paid industry, and earn a very good amount.\n\nMy boyfriend (m26) moved in with us a couple months ago. The rent is split three ways equally. It's a nice, two bedroom flat in Central London, with rent I could stretch to afford by myself on my salary.\n\nSince my sister doesn't earn enough to cover the whole rent, she pays a set amount and I cover the rest of her third. In return, she does household chores for me. The way we view it is it's like another job she has, except the money goes directly to pay her rent. It's a situation we're both very happy with.\n\nWhen my boyfriend moved in, we talked about rent and it made sense to split it three ways. He never asked how my sister could pay it. He earns a decent amount, but less than me due to the nature of the career he's in where it takes a few more years to reach higher pay. The rent's not great for his salary, but not unaffordable.\n\nThe other day, my sister asked my boyfriend to scan over her budgeting and check for any obvious mistakes. He noticed that she payed less rent than him and asked why, so she explained the arrangement we have together. He apparently got all weird and said how he thought our parents were paying her rent or something (our parents aren't poor by any means, but there not 'pay central London rent on top of our own expenses' kind of rich).\n\nWhen I got home, he asked my about it and I explained the same as my sister did. He then got annoyed since I don't accommodate for him earning less than me, and how paying less would really help his finances. I basically said that if he wanted to pay less rent, he could move out, and that I'm not lowering his share of the rent. He replied that it's unfair I cover some of my sister's rent but none of his. I didn't really know what to say, so I told him that he wasn't my sister and maybe it is unfair that my sister has a lower rent, but paying my sister's rent and his rent were two very different things.\n\nHe got all pissy about it and left, and now his mates are texing me saying I'm not supporting him and that I'm clearly not commited to the relationship and basically that I'm being an ass. We haven't even been together that long, so to be honest I'm not that commited to the relationship. I feel like I'm not the asshole in this situation, but his friends' opinions are really throwing me off.", "created_utc": 1678577317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11oyn5x/aita_for_helping_my_sister_financially_and_not_my/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a work agreement with your sister, nothing to do with him or the three equal shares.  He's ignoring all that and making it about you automatically subsidizing those who make less than you.

I don't blame him for being salty about it now.  There is nothing wrong with OP allowing her sister to pay part of her rent with labor.

Or they can break up and he can move out, which it doesn't seem like would bother OP all that much either.", "It is split evenly 1/3 by gf, 1/3 by him, and 1/3 by sister.
