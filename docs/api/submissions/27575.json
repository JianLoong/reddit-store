Our mother has passed when we were kids and our father is retired. Even though our dad is not rich, she was a daddy's girl so she got spoiled. He was never good with money and gambled away part of his savings. \n\nMy sister got a good paying job and moved out. But still keeps asking money from our dad for food saying her salary isnt enough. My dad gives her money for food everymonth. She spends her salary on things she needs like bills, clothes for work, things for her new home, commute, repairs, phone, etc. Before she moved out we made it clear that we weren't going to pay for her rent. \n\nHer laptop broke and she can't work without it. She asked our dad, he said he couldn't afford it. She asked me saying she couldnt afford it, and I (24M) said no since she had a job to pay it off and said she needs to learn how to budget. We didn't give her money for a new laptop. So she bought a macbook with her credit card paying it off monthly.\n\nBut then she resigned to be a writer a few months ago with no money saved. She had publishing houses who was interested in signing her but needed to see a few chapters. There are no guarantees. She said she needed to focus her time to write for her to make it into a career. She says she can't work and write at the same time. And need to focus since there are deadlines. Becoming a writer has been her lifelong dream.\n\nNow she's demanding more money for food for the rest of the month. We didn't give her more and she'll need to wait for next month. Because she spent her food money this month to pay for other things we didn't agree to pay for (rent and macbook). She's saying we're heartless for letting her starve while I'm able to go on vacation (paid with the money I worked hard for).\n\nShe says she's been looking for work for the past month and hasn't been able to be hired. She could always move back home, but she doesn\u2019t because she doesnt like how our dad can be controlling. I can take money out of my savings to give her but she has a habit of asking for more money everymonth. and I feel like if I say yes this time she'll make a habit out of it instead of getting a steady paying job and learning to manage her money. I have my own bills to pay and budget to be able to go on vacation. Admittedly I too still have a lot to learn about managing my money as well so it also feel hypocritcal of me to tell her she needs to manage her money better.\n\nAm I the asshole for letting my sister starve?", "created_utc": 1695607094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rferu/aita_for_letting_my_sister_starve/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is a whole adult.  When I was her age and hard up for money I waited tables on the side.  Unfortunately, since it sounds like Dad was always there to give a hand- out when she wanted it, she knows she doesn't have to ever make an effort.  It's time to cut the cord and let her adult or she will never learn.  If she really is \"starving\" I'm sure she will figure it out real quick.", "NTA.  Your sister picked a horrible time to make a sudden career change.  She couldn't afford to eat while she was working so she decided the prudent thing to do would be to have no income at all.  She basically wants you and your father to fund her new lifestyle.", "NTA.\nYour sister is poor in financial budgeting and poor in character.\n\nShe is trying to guilt both of you into giving her money.\n\nShe gave up a paying job for a 'flight of fancy\" career. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being a writer, but ye gods, have something as a back up. \nSome savings and at least some part time work.\n\nSorry to say it, but your sister is an idiot.", "NTA.  An empty belly can set priorites real fast.", "NTA. You're not letting your sister starve her bad money habits are making her starve. Her choices are not your fault. Learn that early in life and remember it, your life will be easier once you do.", "Nta. Your sister should not have quit her job to write. She should have worked during the day and written at night. What was her plan to pay for her bills? To mooch off off you? It doesn\u2019t sound like she has any savings since she is asking your dad for money every month.   \nAnd you are not heartless for \u201cletting her starve\u201d It sounds like you already gave her money for food and she used it for other stuff, so that\u2019s her problem that she didn\u2019t use the money for food.  Also, food pantries exist were she could go and get food for free.  And she could go move back home, she just doesn\u2019t want to. She would rather just get her way and make you an atm.", "NTA.   She'll just have to live off home made coffee, noodles and sandwiches.  There is plenty of food out there. It's not exciting or particularly nice all the time, but it's there.

I was doing the same exact thing occasionally even if I earn 1.500\u20ac per month plus the tips (I am a waitress in Italy and also an heroin addict, this doesn't mean she is an heroin addict as well, but you know)\n\nAnd as many have just written, no you're not an asshole, she is old enough to learn how save money for something important as food.", "YTA for how many times you said WE about your dads money.", "NTA\n\nYou're not letting her starve.

If she has made the decision to quit her job and become a writer full time, then it's on her to figure out how to make that work. It sounds like she's living in a fantasy world. Making a living as a full-time writer is a dream of many but realized by few. If she really wants to be a writer, she'll make that happen in her off-hours. And then hopefully she becomes one of the lucky few who finds success and she can become the full time writer she aspires to be. \n\nYou don't owe her any explanation for how you spend your money.  She's been allowed to take advantage of the two of you for long enough. Time for her to figure it out.", "i know of one woman who wrote by her sick child's hospital bed(successful writer now).

You're right in that she will constantly keep asking you for more. \n\nShe chose to quit her job knowing she had no savings or income. What did she expect would happen when she ran out of money??? The money fairy doesn't just drop some money on the bottom of her bed every night. \n\nShe was expecting you or your dad to give her money 'coz she has no job'. But you'd already told her you wouldn't lend her money for the laptop so this wouldn't be any different. Your dad already said he couldn't afford to. She's made this decision to quit her job, which was really stupid when she already can't budget within her income, how the he'll did she think she'd be able to pay her bills with no income. \n\nPeople like your sister will continue to take from others. The more times they get given money, the more they feel entitled to it. \n\nJust because you have some savings doesn't mean she's entitled to any of it. You have worked for your money, you have bills to pay. You save for emergencies and so you can afford a holiday. She needs to do the same. \n\nI think she needs to realise she can't just quit her job to 'focus on her writing' and have no money to pay her bills in savings. \n\nShe needs to either get a job or accept she has to move back home with your dad. She can't have it both ways. But even living with your dad she'd need to contribute towards food at least as he won't have the money to pay for her. \n\nShe needs a harsh lesson and a wake up call. Stop enabling her behaviour. If you give in once she'll continue to want more. You won't be helping her learn to budget and realise she needs money to live in the world. She may want to focus on her writing, but for now she needs a full time job for an income and will have to work on writing after work and weekends.", "A hard lesson will do her good. You are not an A.", "NTA This is absolutely bullshit. I'm a writer and your sister's story is nonsense. No legitimate publishing house wants to see chapters of a book the author hasn't finished writing. Lots of authors have 9-5 jobs and still meet deadlines, it's called managing your time. That's because the vast majority of authors, even successful ones, don't make enough off their books to live on. But again, no legitimate publisher is giving deadlines on a book they haven't committed to publish. Your sister is making shit up to get money from you.

If she was starving, there are food banks and food stamp programs. Let me guess- she\u2019s too proud for that? Then she isn\u2019t that hungry. And her constant tapping dad for money is putting his future at risk. What will happen when he can\u2019t take care of himself and he has no savings? Time for her to grow up.", "You are at the beginning of your financial years. You deserve a vacation to rejuvenate and energize for your future work months until you again have holidays or vacation time.

She is not your responsibility. Focus on your budget, grow your savings account.", "NTA, you\u2019re both adults. She can get a part time job while writing", "Less than 5% of authors can make a living from writing books. And that is those who are \u201csigned\u201d authors and most of those 5% are on the equivalent of minimum wage.

Your right, give her money once & she will expect it again. you could maybe help her out this once by giving her just enough to get some food or even take her food shopping, so you know she doesn'tend up spending it on something else, but tell her it is a one off & you have your own costs to meet, so you won't be giving her anymore & she needs to find any job she can to support herself & then stick to this. It's great that she is trying to pursue her dream,but lots of people manage to do this as well as work, she needs to realise she can't be a full time writer when she has no other income.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nSister needs to make it work herself. Even the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author managed to write her books with very minimal funds, she was also a single mum to a baby. She had to write in a cafe because she could not afford to heat her apartment. \n\nThere are lots of options available to your sister but she rejects all and expects other people to fund her life choices. The world doesn\u2019t work that way. Stick to your refusal.", "I would also point out to her that if she is that desperate, she can hang out with the racoons at the nearest Mavdonalds dumpster."]}
