It\u2019s one thing to say you\u2019d appreciate it if she proposed to you and another to say you have \u201cno intention\u201d on proposing, which makes it sound like you won\u2019t want to marry her UNLESS she proposes. I can see how that would come across as hurtful. It sounds like an ultimatum: either you propose to me, or I will not marry you. She sucks as well in that she could have sat down and had an adult conversation with you instead of trying to argue over text.

However, she always expects me to take initiative on dates and romantic events and such.\n\nWe were discussing marriage recently, and she made it clear to me that she wants our future children to have her last name since she will be the one carrying them in her own body, and she's sick of the \"outdated norm of patriarchal lineage.\" I understood and supported her point, but I also suggested that she should be the one to propose to me and buy me a ring (which shouldn't be an issue since she is so committed to reversing cultural gender norms.)\n\nThis wasn't just to play contrarian; I genuinely would appreciate if she would show her appreciation and romantic commitment to me through a proposal. She said that I was being ridiculous and making a false equivalence. I told her that I was not simply arguing-- I have no intention of proposing to her and buying a fancy expensive ring, and I don't see why I should be expected to. She lost it after this and went to her sister's house and sent me 5 messages ranting about how I'm an inconsiderate asshole for telling her to be the one to propose.
