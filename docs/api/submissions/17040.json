It was pretty civil, we were just not meant for each other. I still have her messages and we are good friends.\n\nThe issue is my now GF really wants my Ex\u2019s necklace. I gifted Ex the necklace back when we were dating. She loved it. It was a matching necklace with two cats hugging in the shape of a heart, a black one and a silver one. After we broke up, i put my half of the necklace in my drawer and sort of forgot about it.\n\nThe problem started when I saw my Ex at the rink (we both figure skate), and i noticed she still was wearing her half of the necklace. I questioned it and she told me she just liked the necklace so much. She said that the silver necklace reminded her of her grey cat. She even got a pair of matching sliver earrings to go with the necklace. She then said that if my GF or I was ever uncomfortable, she would be willing to take it off. \n\nI was fine with her answer and as she was leaving my GF arrived (to watch me skate). She took notice in my Ex\u2019s necklace then turned to me and asked if we could also get matching necklaces, \u201cLike Ex and her bf\u201d. (Ex and GF have met since i was still friends with Ex, GF loves Ex as a friend). I was confused and told GF that Ex doesn\u2019t have bf. GF then asks about the necklace and I told her about it.\n\nHere is where GF got upset and said it was weird we had half of a matching necklace. I offered the idea of giving Ex my half of the necklace so she could still enjoy her half. GF said no and said that she wanted Ex\u2019s half. \n\nHere is where I might be the AH, I told her no and that she was crazy for thinking that was a reasonable solution, i was not asking for her half back. \n\nMy reasoning is that Ex loves that necklace while I could care less about mine. GF was also not interested in the cat necklace, she even said that after I ask for it back, she would throw the whole necklace away!

That is crazy! Why does your GF want to ruin someone else\u2019s happiness? For no other reason than jealousy? Childish as hell. Not to mention mean.", "Dude. How do you rationalize being with someone with this kind of ick in their heart? You're an asshole to yourself for sticking with a relationship when someone wants to throw away something someone else treasures when the easier answer is to give away your piece of the jewelry. \n\nNTA for telling her no, but its not crazy, its malicious and vindictive to want to flex on your ex when there is no reason to do that.", "NTA but your new GF is, particularly if she o lying wants it to throw it away. That's major AH territory. I would just give the ex your half if it's entirely meaningless to you.\n\nIt sounds like your GF is testing you, which is a shitty thing immature people do in relationships when they aren't ready for one.", "NTA.  Giving your half to your ex is a classy move, and you should do it before anything happens to your half.  Your GF is sadly not acting classy.  Dude, this is some red flag controlling nonsense.  If you think she's The One, you might want to do some counseling sooner rather than later.", "NTA. She will throw the necklace away? I can see how your girlfriend can be jealous be this sounds vindictive. Maybe just a bit crazy? I'm not sure about keeping this girlfriend around. Maybe you need a better half.", "NTA\n\nGiving your ex your half would be cool.  Your current gf is being jealous and insecure.   Not lovely traits", "NTA - I already don't like your GF.", "NTA: Girlfriend is jealous and possessive. This may be the first time you are seeing it, but it will get worse.", "NTA\n\nYour GF sounds insufferable. She doesn't get to decide what to do with someone else's belongings. You gave the necklace to your ex and now it's hers. It's her call what she wants to do it and she's kind enough to be willing to take it off. \n\nYour ex wear it because it reminded her of her cat. It has no romantic value anymore. Your GF's insecurities & possessiveness make her an AH. She can't seem to accept that you have a life before her. Like she has to feel that she won and therefore thinking that anything or anyone that symbolize your past must be destroyed.", "NTA, but for your own sanity please just dump the new girl! She's already acting like she has control over not only you but your ex as well! I PROMISE this won't end well!", "NTA \n\nYou are allowed to have a lifetime full of experiences. Everything does not need to be rewritten or wiped away just because something new happens in your life path.  When you gave the necklace to your ex gf that was a pleasant experience and your ex gf still enjoys that necklace right up to today. It is nice to have and share pleasant lifetime experiences. \n\nYour current GF does not have the right, and nor should she, to remove, undo, dismiss, ridicule, or cast guilt on your past life path experiences. \n\nYour GF has a lot to learn. I\u2019m not a fan of her\u2026", "NTA and this is a HUGE red flag:\n\n>GF was also not interested in the cat necklace, she even said that after I ask for it back, she would throw the whole necklace away!\n\nShe has no interest in the necklace itself, she only wants to have it because she knows its something your ex loves that you gave to her. She's jealous of a necklace and wants to destroy it.\n\nYou seriously need to reconsider how far you want this relationship to go.

I'd dispose of it, tell your GF the other half isn't yours to give away, and get your GF a new and nicer necklace or matching set", "ESH. It\u2019s weird holding onto your half of \u201cmatching\u201d necklace. I see where the GF has \u201cthoughts\u201d. Her solution is crazy. But so is everything and everyone else.", "NTA\n\n\n\nFirst of all, seems like your ex's response was one of a healthy mindset. You did right for not minding offering your other half to your new gf since it bothers her. Also you cannot just take back a gift you once gave to someone since it's now NOT YOUR PROPERTY, and your gf should be able to understand that.\ud83d\uddff", "Soo your supposed to take a gift back from one girl to give to to another ? Yeah you picked a winner my guy.. a real prize.. \n\nIf she\u2019s ghosted you move on you\u2019re no longer in a relationship with this unreasonable chick.. be thankful and move on.

Ex is also aroace and theres always been signs.

There is no reason for her to demand this and still claim she likes your ex. She's messy.", "It doesn't matter all you did was hug. You liked her at one point in time enough to date her and appreciate her enough as a person to remain friends. But really, it doesn't have to do with your ex or yourself at all but the insecurities of your current girlfriend. She may even be demanding the necklace of your ex to cause a rift between you and your ex or to verify her own paranoia by believing if you won't go get the necklace back you don't love her more than your ex. There really is no winning.", "I'd say tell her it's cheap and you wanted to get her something nicer and better. But I'd just do it, don't propose it or ask her if it would suffice. Doubt she'll complain when she opens a box with a new necklace", "Don't listen to the folks telling you its weird for you to have kept the necklace.\n\nWould we be correct to assume this necklace was given to your first \"real\" girlfriend that you felt deeply for at the time??\n\nThat's a memory you'll always have and TONS of people keep things that remind them of certain time of their life.", "yea i meant that ex is not interested in romance at all (and wasnt that big on it to begin with). gf knows that and even said that is why it\u2019s okay that we\u2019re still friends. maybe it is jealousy of the gift\u2026", "that cat necklace i gave ex was pretty cheap :p another issue is that gf doesn\u2019t even wear necklaces, she\u2019s not big on jewellery.", "yea ex was my first", "New gf is just being small minded and mean. She revealed herself through her demands and behavior. She has shown you who she is, believe her."]}
