Before I met her, I briefly tried a dating app and nothing came out of it so I uninstalled the app.\n\nAnyway, we met with a friend (Nat) and her partner Sally (who is also our friend) for a drink. Nat also brought her friend (Liz) with her which is fine. The more the merrier. So we introduced ourselves and soon after that, Liz mentioned that I matched with her on a dating app. Everyone was surprised. I laughed and mentioned it's a small world. I also said I only used the app for a short time and I don't remember who I matched with as it was more than a year ago then quickly followed that I don't even remember what I had for breakfast. Everyone laughed and we continued chatting and drinking. However, throughout the night, Liz kept bringing up the dating app thing. Which was starting to annoy me and I could tell that my partner was starting to feel uncomfortable. I brushed my annoyance aside and mentioned that we should talk about something else because I really don't recall. Then as the night goes on Liz moved on from the dating app match thing to saying that if she had matched me back that time then I would not be together with my partner now. At this point, I just snapped at her and told her to \"quit it\" as I don't even remember her or matching with her and it's rude to say something like that. We left shortly after that. \n\nSo we got back to our apartment and I checked my phone. I got a message from Nat saying I'm an AH for snapping at Liz like that and she was just trying to befriend me and my partner by making conversation. I just ignored her message.

And good on you for ignoring the message. No reason in engaging in a pointless argument to discuss actions that were completely justifiable. Continue to not respond to it.", "NTA she was absolutely flirting with you and disregarding your relationship right in front of your partner. You were right to shut her down, and I think the way you handled it was still pretty kind given what she said", "NTA.  You were much nicer than I woulda been.  She was told multiple times you didn\u2019t recall it and it was clear that that topic of conversation was something to be moved on from.  She was fixated on something that was making others uncomfortable and once she made that comment about you and you current partner, I don\u2019t blame you for snapping at her.  You were standing up for and defending yourself and your partner.", "NTA- liz was definitely up to something and it good that you said something especially because your girlfriend was feeling uncomfortable.", "Mentioning it once is kinda awkward but not that bad.\n\nMentioning it again might be a bit tactless, but hey, maybe she is an awkward person and really tried to engage with the group.\n\nMentioning it a THIRD TIME, plus saying op wouldn't have been with their partner if they hooked up with her (Liz) is offensive and gross and SHOULD be called out", "That's what I was being annoyed about. I could tell my partner was feeling uncomfortable and she is non-confrontational. Thank you for your insight!", "Yeah I think Liz may have problems with social settings too. But still the OP is NTA", "Or she may have consumed too much alcohol. The post mentions that they all met for drinks. Still doesn't excuse her behavior.", "Thank you. I'll let it pass in the meantime then I'll have a talk with my friend about it.", "NTA. The WLW dating pool is small and there is ALWAYS some overlap. My current partner and I went out with at least three of the same women before we met each other. It's just how it is. But part of what allows lesbian social circles to continue to function is that you don't harp on it or bring it up when it's not welcome!", "That is a weird way to befriend someone if you ask me. Sounds more like she wants to date you still and is still reeling from not getting that chance.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Liz is a creep.", "Nah she was being a weirdo bringing it up. Keep your head up king.", "NTA", "NTA. A rude acquaintance.", "NTA It was weird of her to continue bringing it up in front of your partner and after you tried to brush it off several times. She should be embarrassed.", "Lol NTA we should say quit it more often it\u2019s just perfect", "\"If I matched back, you wouldn't be with your partner right now.\"\n\n\"... I highly doubt that.\"\n\nNTA", "Liz was hitting on you in front of your gf. I would understand bringing up the matching thing once, to get it out the way.  Personally I would do so in a, \"you didn't need tinder to find your perfect match,\" and then move the conversation on. \n\nI would ignore Nat. She's trying to defend her friend but Sally is right, it's was weird and you had every right to nip it in the bud. NTA", "Exactly. Heck I\u2019ve been to parties with more than one ex present. We all behave like civilized people and generally don\u2019t bring it up unless it\u2019s in passing or truly relevant. I only once in my life exited a social situation because an ex was present, and I did that quietly and discreetly - it was because we had recently broken up and I was still having a lot of feelings.", "Just because you matched on a dating app doesn't mean that you would have clicked in real life. The app most likely looks for certain patterns then puts the people together (like if you say you like blue and Chinese food, the program would search for people who like blue and people who like Chinese food and match you to them).\n\nLiz was trying to diminish your current relationship and trying to insinuate that you missed out on a 'good' thing. Ignore her and tell Nat her friend was making you and your partner uncomfortable.", "Pick-me-girls do not like to not be picked. Liz knew what she was doing, she was trying to cause a fight with your partner. NTA", "She wasn't trying to befriend you, she was trying to pick you up and not taking no for an answer. Be glad you deleted the app when you did and did NOT end up with her. NTA", "NTA not only was Liz being weird, she was being outright rude to you and your partner.   How exactly is saying \"you wouldn't even be with your partner if it's given you the time of day back then\" trying to befriend you and anything less than insulting to  your partner.  \n\n\nShe was absolutely trying to start some drama and trying to get you to see what you \"missed out\" on.   You didn't remember it or even care so she kept trying to drag it up stove you clearly weren't as infatuated with her as she hoped or expected you to be because her who was bruised.", "NTA, after the first couple instances of her mentioning it and you not engaging on the subject, she should have left it alone. Given the context of it being the first time IRL encounter, it doesn't even have the legs of it being a call back joke or a somewhat inside joke. Like if it turned out you two are polar opposed a joke of \"dam dogded a bullet there eh?\" or \"See, this is why we wouldn't have worked, your allergic to fun\" would be more in line with a friendship based around gently teasing. It's also weird to say, \"She'd be with me, not you if we dated,\" to your partner because what are you meant to do with that? It's making your partner seem like they are lesser but she also is putting down her own partner, being like, \"You are option B.\" \n\nI can understand why your friend messaged you being upset. They are likely embarrassed that the night didn't go the way they wanted to. Hopefully, the next time you guys get together, you'll all be able to move on. Good luck with it all.", "NTA", "NTA. It definitely was a weird thing to bring up in front of your current partner. As soon as you attempted to shut it down, she should have stopped and she didn\u2019t.", "NTA, she was clearly making you and your partner uncomfortable and kept going even when you tried to change subject", "NTA Nat is out of line for not sticking up for you. Liz is out of line on so many levels.", "NTA. She should have avoided mentioning it even once. Who would ever think that bringing up something like that is a good way to befriend a couple?? \n\nShe wasn't befriending. She's just a jealous a**. You did the right thing by shutting it down.", "> saying that if she had matched me back that time then I would not be together with my partner now\n\nI would\u2019ve responded by thanking her, effusively and at great length, for not matching me.\n\nThe vibe to aim for would be \u2018holy crap I really dodged a bullet there\u2019\n\nNTA but maybe you should\u2019ve been a little bit of one", "NTA.  She repeatedly brought something up after telling her to stop AND THEN had the nerve to mention your partner in all of this.  This was not making friendly conversation...this was uncomfortable and unwanted.", "NTA. Weirdo behavior. Avoid Liz she's the type to live to stir up drama. Very inappropriate. Don't go out with her alone. Next thing you know she'll be saying you made a pass at her.", "NTA, although I think \"snapping\" is really a good thing.  Better to value respond, \"Well, I've met you now and I can assure you that we wouldn't have made it to even a second date because you are very annoying\".  Ok, maybe my way isn't better.", "Yes that's what pushes it over the edge from awkward connection to rudeness-the implication that you would not have be with your current partner if you had given this person a try. \nHow on earth she would think \"oh I know what would make these strangers feel comfortable with me!\" at this idea is absurd.", "I can be socially awkward and sometimes think things are funny that other people aren\u2019t. I tried to put myself in their shoes and see if she thought they would all laugh about the coincidence\u2026but I don\u2019t know\u2026I think once OP mentioned they should talk about something else after the second mention, even I would get the hint. I think I agree with OP being NTA and right to say something.", "NTA - *Liz moved on from the dating app match thing to saying that if she had matched me back that time then I would not be together with my partner now.*\n\nThis is not making conversation.  This is making a statement.  And to make it when your partner was with you was a dick move.  She was challenging your partner to her face.  There was nothing \"friendly\" about it.", "NTA, it's extremely rude to mention in front of someone and their partner that if you had gotten a date with one of them before they met they wouldn't be together.", "You already know you aren't because Liz was being rude to start. NTA.", "You already know you aren't because Liz was being rude to start. NTA.", "I'm willing to bet she didn't get that many matches and that's partly why she's so fixated on you. I don't even remember what most of my matches look like, except for the ones I actually dated of course. NTA", "NTA. Very bizarre and inappropriate behavior from Liz.", "NTA.\n\nYou tried to be polite about it and she didn't get the message, and from what you've described, you weren't even actually rude when you snapped.\n\nShe may not have actually had any ill intentions, but constantly bringing up something and making people feel awkward and uncomfortable even when you've been told to stop is just weird at a certain point.", "She was trying to befriend you and your partner by bringing up yall matched on a dating app multiple time no she wasn't she was trying to make you and your partner have a fight so she could fuck.", "Nta Liz sounds like she was jealous. There's no way she was trying to be your friend. If she was trying to be friendly she would have drop that whole dating ap from the start and not kept bring it up. She was rude and being disrespectful to your relationship because she said had she match back you both be in a relationship. Nat is wrong to put the blame on you. You did nothing wrong even sally is on your side.", "NTA. Liz shouldn't have constantly pushed to have a conversation about the dating app match. I don't blame you at all for snapping at her. She was rude and inconsiderate.", "NTA. Nat has shown she is not your friend- she prefers creeps.", "Nta", "Info : have you told your friend you don't want to be friend with her ? That she was not friendly ? Like where's the aita here", "NTA. Liz needs to let go", "one does not befriend another and their partner by bring up the dating app and how thither matched.\n\nOnce is fine.  you all had a laugh and moved on.\n\nLiz brought it up a few times and that would make most people uncomfortable.\n\nNTA", "Liz looked jealous. There is no way she is trying to be your friend", "NTA This Liz is troubling and I\u2019m really glad you stood up for self and gf. It really should have been on friend who brought Liz to shut this down. I\u2019m really sorry you ended up having to deal with it but I think you handled things perfectly. Super weird behaviour.\n\nE: extra word", "Too bad she\u2019s nonconfrontational because of this happened to my partner I\u2019d say \u201cwell you did match and he doesn\u2019t remember you so I guess you\u2019re not really a threat now are you?\u201d", "NTA. Her bringing it up the first time I think is fine like \"haha small world\" polite conversation, as you said, and then it should've ended there. Her saying shit like \"if we'd matched you wouldn't be with your girlfriend\" is weird and very much makes it sound like she's hitting on you. Very out of line.", "NTA. Clearly Liz believes that you were the one that got away. Mentioning it so many times proves she was  hung up on it. You weren\u2019t wrong for losing it on her because she was being completely inappropriate and if your friend can\u2019t see that, that\u2019s anew issue within itself.", "NTA it\u2019s not \u201cbefriending\u201d to tell someone or their partner that they would be with you instead of them if you two matched. \n\nThat\u2019s how you make enemies, not conversation.", "There's probably less AH ways of shutting someone down but it's not on you to come up with them, she was the one making everyone uncomfortable. Since she was single and meeting 2 couples out, I wonder if she felt like a 5th wheel and felt the need to prove she's attractive or some weird competitive nonsense.", "NTA. I\u2019d love to know what response they think would have been appropriate\u2026 \u201cIf we\u2019d matched faster you\u2019d be here with me instead of your girlfriend!\u201d \n\n1. \u201cNah, my girlfriend is the only one for me, I\u2019m sure I would have dumped you quick enough.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cOh yeah, bye (girlfriend), I swiped right before we met so I owe it to her and myself to give that a go!\u201d \n\n3. \u201cYou\u2019re right! (Girlfriend), wanna try a threesome?\u201d\n\n4. \u201cFunny that I made such an impression, I guess you don\u2019t get many matches huh?\u201d \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure your response was about as appropriate as she gave you the chance to be. You didn\u2019t encourage her when she brought it up the first time but she kept bringing it up, eventually you had to be direct.", "She keeps bringing it up because she\u2019s interested in you.  You were right to shut her down.  Befriending someone isn\u2019t disrespecting their relationship.  If that\u2019s what Nat thinks friendship is, she needs to see someone.
