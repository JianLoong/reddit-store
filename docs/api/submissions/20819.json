Before I met her, I briefly tried a dating app and nothing came out of it so I uninstalled the app.\n\nAnyway, we met with a friend (Nat) and her partner Sally (who is also our friend) for a drink. Nat also brought her friend (Liz) with her which is fine. The more the merrier. So we introduced ourselves and soon after that, Liz mentioned that I matched with her on a dating app. Everyone was surprised. I laughed and mentioned it's a small world. I also said I only used the app for a short time and I don't remember who I matched with as it was more than a year ago then quickly followed that I don't even remember what I had for breakfast. Everyone laughed and we continued chatting and drinking. However, throughout the night, Liz kept bringing up the dating app thing. Which was starting to annoy me and I could tell that my partner was starting to feel uncomfortable. I brushed my annoyance aside and mentioned that we should talk about something else because I really don't recall. Then as the night goes on Liz moved on from the dating app match thing to saying that if she had matched me back that time then I would not be together with my partner now. At this point, I just snapped at her and told her to \"quit it\" as I don't even remember her or matching with her and it's rude to say something like that. We left shortly after that. \n\nSo we got back to our apartment and I checked my phone. I got a message from Nat saying I'm an AH for snapping at Liz like that and she was just trying to befriend me and my partner by making conversation. I just ignored her message.

She was told multiple times you didn\u2019t recall it and it was clear that that topic of conversation was something to be moved on from.

The app most likely looks for certain patterns then puts the people together (like if you say you like blue and Chinese food, the program would search for people who like blue and people who like Chinese food and match you to them).\n\nLiz was trying to diminish your current relationship and trying to insinuate that you missed out on a 'good' thing.

How exactly is saying \"you wouldn't even be with your partner if it's given you the time of day back then\" trying to befriend you and anything less than insulting to  your partner.  \n\n\nShe was absolutely trying to start some drama and trying to get you to see what you \"missed out\" on.

Like if it turned out you two are polar opposed a joke of \"dam dogded a bullet there eh?\" or \"See, this is why we wouldn't have worked, your allergic to fun\" would be more in line with a friendship based around gently teasing. It's also weird to say, \"She'd be with me, not you if we dated,\" to your partner because what are you meant to do with that? It's making your partner seem like they are lesser but she also is putting down her own partner, being like, \"You are option B.\" \n\nI can understand why your friend messaged you being upset.

Liz is out of line on so many levels.", "NTA. She should have avoided mentioning it even once.

She repeatedly brought something up after telling her to stop AND THEN had the nerve to mention your partner in all of this.  This was not making friendly conversation...this was uncomfortable and unwanted.", "NTA. Weirdo behavior. Avoid Liz she's the type to live to stir up drama. Very inappropriate. Don't go out with her alone. Next thing you know she'll be saying you made a pass at her.", "NTA, although I think \"snapping\" is really a good thing.  Better to value respond, \"Well, I've met you now and I can assure you that we wouldn't have made it to even a second date because you are very annoying\".  Ok, maybe my way isn't better.", "Yes that's what pushes it over the edge from awkward connection to rudeness-the implication that you would not have be with your current partner if you had given this person a try. \nHow on earth she would think \"oh I know what would make these strangers feel comfortable with me!\" at this idea is absurd.", "I can be socially awkward and sometimes think things are funny that other people aren\u2019t. I tried to put myself in their shoes and see if she thought they would all laugh about the coincidence\u2026but I don\u2019t know\u2026I think once OP mentioned they should talk about something else after the second mention, even I would get the hint.

This is making a statement.  And to make it when your partner was with you was a dick move.  She was challenging your partner to her face.

Very bizarre and inappropriate behavior from Liz.", "NTA.\n\nYou tried to be polite about it and she didn't get the message, and from what you've described, you weren't even actually rude when you snapped.\n\nShe may not have actually had any ill intentions, but constantly bringing up something and making people feel awkward and uncomfortable even when you've been told to stop is just weird at a certain point.", "She was trying to befriend you and your partner by bringing up yall matched on a dating app multiple time no she wasn't she was trying to make you and your partner have a fight so she could fuck.", "Nta Liz sounds like she was jealous. There's no way she was trying to be your friend. If she was trying to be friendly she would have drop that whole dating ap from the start and not kept bring it up.

You did nothing wrong even sally is on your side.", "NTA. Liz shouldn't have constantly pushed to have a conversation about the dating app match. I don't blame you at all for snapping at her.

Her bringing it up the first time I think is fine like \"haha small world\" polite conversation, as you said, and then it should've ended there. Her saying shit like \"if we'd matched you wouldn't be with your girlfriend\" is weird and very much makes it sound like she's hitting on you. Very out of line.", "NTA. Clearly Liz believes that you were the one that got away. Mentioning it so many times proves she was  hung up on it. You weren\u2019t wrong for losing it on her because she was being completely inappropriate and if your friend can\u2019t see that, that\u2019s anew issue within itself.", "NTA it\u2019s not \u201cbefriending\u201d to tell someone or their partner that they would be with you instead of them if you two matched. \n\nThat\u2019s how you make enemies, not conversation.", "There's probably less AH ways of shutting someone down but it's not on you to come up with them, she was the one making everyone uncomfortable. Since she was single and meeting 2 couples out, I wonder if she felt like a 5th wheel and felt the need to prove she's attractive or some weird competitive nonsense.", "NTA. I\u2019d love to know what response they think would have been appropriate\u2026 \u201cIf we\u2019d matched faster you\u2019d be here with me instead of your girlfriend!\u201d \n\n1. \u201cNah, my girlfriend is the only one for me, I\u2019m sure I would have dumped you quick enough.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cOh yeah, bye (girlfriend), I swiped right before we met so I owe it to her and myself to give that a go!\u201d \n\n3. \u201cYou\u2019re right!

You didn\u2019t encourage her when she brought it up the first time but she kept bringing it up, eventually you had to be direct.", "She keeps bringing it up because she\u2019s interested in you.

Even though you and Liz allegedly matched on the site, it's significant that you two didn't connect! All of Liz's suppositions of what-if are pointless. She may have been bowled over at the coincidence of meeting you. You must have left quite the impression if she remembered your face after so much time had passed. You, on the other hand, didn't recall having seen her at all.\n\nLiz may not have meant any harm, but she was being socially tone deaf not to realize you didn't want to be held hostage as she went down memory lane over an encounter that didn't actually happen, never would have happened, and is meaningless.\n\nYour only gaffe was snapping at her -- but I understand why you did so. You were right to ignore the commentary from Nat. You should also ignore commentary from Sally, even though Sally agrees with you. You are an adult and can think and act for yourself. Really, the only persons whose opinions matter are yours and those of your partner.", "NTA, she clearly didn't gave good intentions. if I were you I would have said \"oh I used that dating app but didn't really find anyone of value or interest so deleted it. Thank God my partner came along\" or \"yikes I must have been desperate back then\"\n\nThen again, im petty", "NTA. Liz was not trying to befriend BOTH of you, she was trying to call dibs.

Glad you called her out.", "The person you're replying to is talking about how they would react in regards to their relationship, not necessarily the one described here.", "NTA", "NTA, that chick was an attention hog that seemed incapable of conversation that didn't focus on her.

Over and over and over again", "NTA. She was being weird and kind of territorial.", "NTA lesbian community is a small world and we\u2019re all about 2 or 3 degrees of separation.  Her saying those things was really wrong.  She was hitting on you in front of your partner.  Not okay", "\"Sounds like I dodged a bullet, then.\"", "NTA\n\nYou adroitly responded, deflected and redirected the repeated dating match mentions. She challenged your partner and how strong your relationship is with that last comment.\n\nI don\u2019t see how saying \u201cquit it\u201d and pointing out her rudeness is snapping. Snapping would have been Real Housewives face slapping. \n\nWhy is your mutual friend scolding you  and not outraged by Liz\u2019s behavior", "NTA she crossed boundaries and made you and your partner uncomfortable, i would\u2019ve had some choice words to say to her as well", "NTA, but for next time when she says \"if I had matched you back you wouldn't be with her\", the answer is \"haha, oh yes I would, you're really not my type\".\n\nShe sounds jealous and kind of stalkery.", "NTA\n\nMentioning that once, no harm done. You can all laugh about it! \n\nBuilding up on it as \"had we met, you and current partner would not have been an item LMFAO\" over and over is ridiculous and it's giving vibes that she did that on purpose. \n\nNTA, keep your distance from her, you don't have to entertain this person, nor having her around to make you guys uncomfortable about your relationship", "A foruth time and she'd escalate it to \"What do you even see in your partner!! I'm **hawt,** why didn't you go for all this!?\"", "Boom! I get it that partner is non-confrontational but damn, better start training to be stealthy confrontational! Like \"I highly doubt that, lol! What's for dessert?!\" and not give a care about that person xDD.\n\nBe petty like, if they see each other again and that pick-me girl starts again, OP's partner can say \"Oh yeah, you're the one he doesn't even remember, lol! Lisa, right? No, wait, Zoella?!\"\n\nThrow the uncomfortable back!", "I think it's the other way around? \nAs I read it, OP matched her. But she didn't match back? \n\nWhich only makes the conversation even more weird tbh. \nSounds like now she saw OP and what she's like in a social setting. She got annoyed that she didn't match back a year ago.", "NTA. Been in this same situation and I got way more confrontational than you. As far as I\u2019m concerned you were well within your rights to tell her to shut the fuck up and then turn right to your friend and ask what the hell.", "NTA- She didn't just bring it up once she brought it up multiple times throughout the night. You're obviously in a good relationship and aren't looking for another one. If she didn't want to get snapped on, then she should have read the room and moved on. If she wanted to make friends then bringing up the dating app was the wrong thing to do, as that applies to her still looking not trying to make friends. She could have tried to find common ground to talk about instead.", "NTA\n\nThat wasn't befriending, that was hitting on you in front of your partner. She has an unhealthy fixation.", "NTA - she was trying to befriend you and your partner with those comments? I think not. Very rude person, and you did the right thing standing up for your relationship/leaving  the situation", "'You'd be with me if you'd met me first' is a hell of a weird thing to say to someone you've just met in front of their spouse.\n\nLiz is really odd.\n\nNTA.", "Well some people remember alot of things \ud83e\udd2d\nStill, doesn\u2019t change this situation. You are right, OP was right.", "Yes, and Liz was even more rude in that she said \"if I had matched you back you wouldn't be together\" meaning OP picked Liz but Liz didn't pick her back, so Liz rejected her back then but if she hadn't they would be together. So it's also a dig that Liz didn't want her but OP wanted Liz. Narc vibes all the way.", ">I think it's the other way around? As I read it, OP matched her. But she didn't match back?\n\nOoohh I see! Yes, it does make it weirder, now, lol!\n\nShe's defo now thinking that she lost a good chance. But if she's annoyed then she shouldn't be \"taking it out\" on them, the idiot. It's like OP dodged a bullet xD", "> As I read it, OP matched her. But she didn't match back?\n\nI only used dating apps briefly, but in all the major ones I tried you both had to match with each other to even know, right?", "Oh, I agree. OP definitely seems to have dodget a bullet there. \nShe had never met OP or her gf before. And that's how she acts? Ouch. especially when it was herself who didn't match back. Who even remembers someone who matched you a year ago. Unless you have a insane good memory.", "\"If she had matched me back, I wouldn't have been with my current partner.\" That's the line I base my comments on, haha. \n\nBut I honestly don't know. I haven't used dating apps in a lot of years. \nBut what I hear from friends, most places notifies you when you have a match, you can then go see who matched you, and decide if you want to match them back and the talking can begin. \nSometimes, texting will be locked until you match each other.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, obviously, she was waay out of line.", "I remember matching with bots, but that's about it.", "And still Liz has no idea why she's single, lol.", "I agree, the comment about how OP and OPs partner wouldn't be together had OP met the match really moves it beyond awkward and into conpletely inappropriate/disrespectful.", "If this is the way Liz \"befriends\" people - she needs some serious help with communication.\n\nNTA. Good for you.", "A damn mystery that is.", "If she remembers him, might even be because she was like \"Look at this idiot, thinking he has a chance with me, LOL!!\"! Otherwise why be so memorable to her when she didn't accept the match? \n\nDunno, I'm spiralling here xDD", "NTA. Liz was being rude, even if she wasn't meaning to be.", "NTA", "No ure not. Liz deserved it. Wtf is she trying to do? Break u guys up while ur gf is there? Rude.", "This is so true. I know a lot of friends past partners who are also friends or acquainted with me.", "According to what she said (Liz), she did not match back. From what I recall, I used a dating app (exclusive for WLW) where you get notifications if someone liked/matched you. You can either match them back so you could start a conversation with them and view their profile OR you could pay for a subscription to freely see who liked/matched you."]}
