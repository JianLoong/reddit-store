Before I met her, I briefly tried a dating app and nothing came out of it so I uninstalled the app.\n\nAnyway, we met with a friend (Nat) and her partner Sally (who is also our friend) for a drink. Nat also brought her friend (Liz) with her which is fine. The more the merrier. So we introduced ourselves and soon after that, Liz mentioned that I matched with her on a dating app. Everyone was surprised. I laughed and mentioned it's a small world. I also said I only used the app for a short time and I don't remember who I matched with as it was more than a year ago then quickly followed that I don't even remember what I had for breakfast. Everyone laughed and we continued chatting and drinking. However, throughout the night, Liz kept bringing up the dating app thing. Which was starting to annoy me and I could tell that my partner was starting to feel uncomfortable. I brushed my annoyance aside and mentioned that we should talk about something else because I really don't recall. Then as the night goes on Liz moved on from the dating app match thing to saying that if she had matched me back that time then I would not be together with my partner now. At this point, I just snapped at her and told her to \"quit it\" as I don't even remember her or matching with her and it's rude to say something like that. We left shortly after that. \n\nSo we got back to our apartment and I checked my phone. I got a message from Nat saying I'm an AH for snapping at Liz like that and she was just trying to befriend me and my partner by making conversation. I just ignored her message. To my surprise, Sally also massaged me and said she thought Liz was being weird and she understands why I reacted that way. \n\nSo, AITA for snapping at an acquaintance?", "created_utc": 1687961789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14lapq3/aita_for_snapping_at_an_acquaintance_for/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And good on you for ignoring the message. No reason in engaging in a pointless argument to discuss actions that were completely justifiable. Continue to not respond to it.", "NTA she was absolutely flirting with you and disregarding your relationship right in front of your partner. You were right to shut her down, and I think the way you handled it was still pretty kind given what she said", "NTA.  You were much nicer than I woulda been.  She was told multiple times you didn\u2019t recall it and it was clear that that topic of conversation was something to be moved on from.  She was fixated on something that was making others uncomfortable and once she made that comment about you and you current partner, I don\u2019t blame you for snapping at her.  You were standing up for and defending yourself and your partner.", "NTA- liz was definitely up to something and it good that you said something especially because your girlfriend was feeling uncomfortable.", "Mentioning it once is kinda awkward but not that bad.\n\nMentioning it again might be a bit tactless, but hey, maybe she is an awkward person and really tried to engage with the group.\n\nMentioning it a THIRD TIME, plus saying op wouldn't have been with their partner if they hooked up with her (Liz) is offensive and gross and SHOULD be called out", "That's what I was being annoyed about.

I highly doubt that.\"\n\nNTA", "Liz was hitting on you in front of your gf. I would understand bringing up the matching thing once, to get it out the way.  Personally I would do so in a, \"you didn't need tinder to find your perfect match,\" and then move the conversation on. \n\nI would ignore Nat. She's trying to defend her friend but Sally is right, it's was weird and you had every right to nip it in the bud. NTA", "Exactly. Heck I\u2019ve been to parties with more than one ex present. We all behave like civilized people and generally don\u2019t bring it up unless it\u2019s in passing or truly relevant. I only once in my life exited a social situation because an ex was present, and I did that quietly and discreetly - it was because we had recently broken up and I was still having a lot of feelings."]}
