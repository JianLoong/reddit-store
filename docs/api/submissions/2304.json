When we decided to move in together, we had long discussions about our expectations and rules. One of my hard rule is no pets what so ever. She agreed and we moved in together.\n\nI work odd hours and on call which means my schedule won\u2019t allow me to take care of any animal as they deserve. For example, I might get off work at 5pm one day but might not be off at 9pm the next day. That means if I have a pet, it will have to wait an extra 4 hours to be walked or fed. Also, I love to travel during my off times and I don\u2019t want to put up with the headache and expense of finding a pet sitting or kennel. Lastly, I know it\u2019ll cost thousands of dollars a year to keep a pet when you factor in food and vet cost. TBH, I\u2019d rather invest that money.\n\nSo things went well for about 6 months until my gf asked if we can get a dog because she loves them and have always had a dog growing up. I said absolutely not and reminded her of our pre-move in discussion and agreement. She spent the next two months alternating between begging, trying to make deals, guilting, and demanding. I got tired of it so I said if she wants a dog, it\u2019ll be her dog and she\u2019s solely responsible for it. I will have nothing to do with it. She quickly agreed. Just to be sure, I drew up a contract that releases me from everything that has to do with the dog and she signed it. I know it\u2019s not legally binding and it\u2019s not meant to be a legal document. I just wanted her to know for certain that she\u2019s responsible for this dog.\n\nShe went to the pound and after a few visits, she found the dog she wanted. For the last few months, she kept up her end of the agreement. She walked the dog, fed it, bought stuff for it, the whole work. A couple of weeks ago, her dog started to move differently and seemed off so she took it to the vet. It turned out the dog had a disc disease that will require surgery and other treatment to the tune of about $5,000. She told me and said it won\u2019t be so bad if we split the cost. I stopped her right there and said I\u2019m not paying, it\u2019s her dog. She can afford to pay for the cost, so even if I don\u2019t pay the dog will still go through the surgery and the treatment. She just doesn\u2019t want to pay for it all by herself and said I was heartless for not taking care of \u201cour\u201d dog.

The fact that OP had GF sign a contract in the first place indicates an awareness of this.\n\nSelf-Edit: For what it's worth, I think it's great that you acknowledge that you're not currently in a position to have a pet. A lot of pets are mistreated or abandoned because people got them before considering the big picture and how the pet would fit into their lives.

If you stay with her this is a glimpse into what will happen every time what you agree on isn't exactly what she wanted.\n\nShe seems to think that over time agreements between you somehow dissolve as reality slowly shifts to become what she wanted it to be all along.

She's gonna have to pony up the money for surgery. She should also look into pet insurance - not sure if it'd help but couldn't hurt.", "NTA. But you shouldn't have given in. Your reasons for not wanting a pet are completely valid and reasonable. I know relationships have to deal with compromising, but on such a big thing is a huge red flag as far as compatibility goes.", "NTA, but really you shouldn\u2019t have given in.", "NTA- unfortunately you should have told her you would move out if she gets a dog. I love my dog, i would never expect my partner to pay for him though because he is my dog.", "NTA.

At least according to you, you laid out very clearly and explicitly that you did not want to be involved with anything pet-related. She manipulated you into relenting and is now trying to manipulate you into paying for it. She's only going to keep manipulating you if she knows it works. \n\nAlso, I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, but I remember hearing somewhere that informal contracts *can* be legally enforceable under some situations, might be interesting to look into that (although just out of curiosity, I wouldn't recommend trying to prosecute her for being upset that you don't like her dog).", "NTA- You were forthcoming about your views, gave reasonable explanations, and also, made sure she was aware of all of those. \n\nYou even made her sign a \"contract\" . Which could be considered cruel to some people, but hey, at least she knew the details, and you have something to go back on. \n\nMyself, I would love an animal, and have had many. They do cost a lot, and especially with dogs (if you can't take them with you) they will need to be taken care of more so. Cats are fine to leave for the weekend,  and reptiles for a week. Dogs??? Not even 12 hours. \n\nIt was her choice to have this animal, that includes all cost associated with it. \n\nEven if this is a long term relationship that will turn to marriage, everyone says your money is their money... but still is not true, because you both have expenses that you will pay on your own. Most people now a days only combine shared things in a joint account, and still have their own money and bills..

I\u2019d personally help if I could cause I\u2019m a sucker for dogs but you in no way have any responsibility to help her.

I never understood dog people until I became one, now I know I will forever be a dog person and that is something I would want my life partner to be on the same page as me on.", "Nah dude. The audacity!", "NTA your GF seems a bit immature and somewhat entitled. As a pet owner, I know that vet expenses can be high. There\u2019s a reason pet health insurance is available (at least in the states).", "Nta.. it was your agreement but I will also say if she\u2019s an animal person and you\u2019re not it\u2019s probably not going to work out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She agreed. signed a contract. \nUsually a vet bill is somewhere from $30-$150. non surgical ER visits are like $1k. she was ready for the responsibility and took it on.\nShe found a dog at the pound ($200 at most typically) and picked it up and that\u2019s her pet. Got it supplies for a few hundred. Suddenly she was faced with a major cost to ensure the pet\u2019s heallth - not just the usual vet bill/healthcare. Not every pet goes through this.

It just seems like she wants help.\nit\u2019s up to you to decide whether or not to help. \nan animal costs muuuuch less to put down. however that may or may not be way too sudden of a decision to make or too drastic depending on whatever comes with that disease (i don\u2019t know). another option as well would be letting the dog live with it until it starts to suffer and then having it put down. not everything last forever, and it really hurts, but it\u2019s okay. dogs aren\u2019t meant to live forever anyway Also, she can finance that amount sometimes w the vet, or open a credit card for it if possible. \nIt\u2019s up to yall as a couple, in a way you are the dog\u2019s other parent, and empathy let alone symptathy is important.
