When we decided to move in together, we had long discussions about our expectations and rules. One of my hard rule is no pets what so ever. She agreed and we moved in together.\n\nI work odd hours and on call which means my schedule won\u2019t allow me to take care of any animal as they deserve. For example, I might get off work at 5pm one day but might not be off at 9pm the next day. That means if I have a pet, it will have to wait an extra 4 hours to be walked or fed. Also, I love to travel during my off times and I don\u2019t want to put up with the headache and expense of finding a pet sitting or kennel. Lastly, I know it\u2019ll cost thousands of dollars a year to keep a pet when you factor in food and vet cost. TBH, I\u2019d rather invest that money.\n\nSo things went well for about 6 months until my gf asked if we can get a dog because she loves them and have always had a dog growing up. I said absolutely not and reminded her of our pre-move in discussion and agreement. She spent the next two months alternating between begging, trying to make deals, guilting, and demanding. I got tired of it so I said if she wants a dog, it\u2019ll be her dog and she\u2019s solely responsible for it. I will have nothing to do with it. She quickly agreed. Just to be sure, I drew up a contract that releases me from everything that has to do with the dog and she signed it. I know it\u2019s not legally binding and it\u2019s not meant to be a legal document. I just wanted her to know for certain that she\u2019s responsible for this dog.\n\nShe went to the pound and after a few visits, she found the dog she wanted. For the last few months, she kept up her end of the agreement. She walked the dog, fed it, bought stuff for it, the whole work. A couple of weeks ago, her dog started to move differently and seemed off so she took it to the vet. It turned out the dog had a disc disease that will require surgery and other treatment to the tune of about $5,000. She told me and said it won\u2019t be so bad if we split the cost. I stopped her right there and said I\u2019m not paying, it\u2019s her dog. She can afford to pay for the cost, so even if I don\u2019t pay the dog will still go through the surgery and the treatment. She just doesn\u2019t want to pay for it all by herself and said I was heartless for not taking care of \u201cour\u201d dog. I reminded her that it\u2019s her dog.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668441243, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yv3gft/aita_for_refusing_to_split_the_cost_of_the_vet/", "score": 1176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's in the wrong, and you do not owe her for the care of her dog. You might want to look at the relationship, though. A LOT of manipulation (or attempted manipulation) seems to be happening. A lot of boundaries have been crossed, too. Those are pretty big red flags. The fact that OP had GF sign a contract in the first place indicates an awareness of this.\n\nSelf-Edit: For what it's worth, I think it's great that you acknowledge that you're not currently in a position to have a pet. A lot of pets are mistreated or abandoned because people got them before considering the big picture and how the pet would fit into their lives.

This is exactly why you put it in writing.", "NTA It's a pity you gave in on getting a dog in the first place, but at least you know now that she is one of those people who think they can make agreements and then willfully break them as the other will just come round in time. If you stay with her this is a glimpse into what will happen every time what you agree on isn't exactly what she wanted.\n\nShe seems to think that over time agreements between you somehow dissolve as reality slowly shifts to become what she wanted it to be all along. No pets ever becomes her having a dog. It being crystal clear that it's just her dog becomes it being \"our\" dog with joint responsibility for it, and so on.\n\nIt's extremely hard to deal with someone like this because they aren't even honest with themselves and no agreement sticks.\n\nGiving in or letting things slide would only teach her that this technique works and then its use would escalate.", "NTA.

She's gonna have to pony up the money for surgery. She should also look into pet insurance - not sure if it'd help but couldn't hurt.", "NTA. But you shouldn't have given in. Your reasons for not wanting a pet are completely valid and reasonable. I know relationships have to deal with compromising, but on such a big thing is a huge red flag as far as compatibility goes.", "NTA, but really you shouldn\u2019t have given in.", "NTA- unfortunately you should have told her you would move out if she gets a dog. I love my dog, i would never expect my partner to pay for him though because he is my dog.", "NTA.

At least according to you, you laid out very clearly and explicitly that you did not want to be involved with anything pet-related. She manipulated you into relenting and is now trying to manipulate you into paying for it. She's only going to keep manipulating you if she knows it works. \n\nAlso, I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, but I remember hearing somewhere that informal contracts *can* be legally enforceable under some situations, might be interesting to look into that (although just out of curiosity, I wouldn't recommend trying to prosecute her for being upset that you don't like her dog).", "NTA- You were forthcoming about your views, gave reasonable explanations, and also, made sure she was aware of all of those. \n\nYou even made her sign a \"contract\" . Which could be considered cruel to some people, but hey, at least she knew the details, and you have something to go back on. \n\nMyself, I would love an animal, and have had many. They do cost a lot, and especially with dogs (if you can't take them with you) they will need to be taken care of more so. Cats are fine to leave for the weekend,  and reptiles for a week. Dogs??? Not even 12 hours. \n\nIt was her choice to have this animal, that includes all cost associated with it. \n\nEven if this is a long term relationship that will turn to marriage, everyone says your money is their money... but still is not true, because you both have expenses that you will pay on your own. Most people now a days only combine shared things in a joint account, and still have their own money and bills..

I\u2019d personally help if I could cause I\u2019m a sucker for dogs but you in no way have any responsibility to help her. I think it\u2019s sweet that even though you really didn\u2019t want pets you compromised in the first place so this is def on her.", "NTA but it sounds like you two have some foundational differences. I never understood dog people until I became one, now I know I will forever be a dog person and that is something I would want my life partner to be on the same page as me on.", "Nah dude. The audacity!", "NTA your GF seems a bit immature and somewhat entitled. As a pet owner, I know that vet expenses can be high. There\u2019s a reason pet health insurance is available (at least in the states).", "Nta.. it was your agreement but I will also say if she\u2019s an animal person and you\u2019re not it\u2019s probably not going to work out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If not, then NTA", "I think YTA, but being completely honest you two aren't compatible. She has fed, taken care of, walked, etc for this dog for well over 6 months, it's not unreasonable for her to assume that she may be able to convince you to help her especially if you have any form of relationship with the animal. It's not really fair to compare the dog to an inanimate object that she maintains sole ownership of, the dog is a living breathing creature with thoughts and feelings of their own.\n\n Imo it's not unreasonable to compare it more to a child where eventually your money in someway circles back to the child anyway. Even if you didn't necessarily give it to them directly. On top of which a \"contract\" has the side affect of coming off hostile and crass especially for the care of a living animal. Plus your reasons for not wanting a dog is not mitigated by simply not claiming the dog. If it was both of you guys' dog then she'd still be taking care of them while you are away, if you get married and have a joint account then your money is still going to the dog, and if you two ever go on a vacation then both of you would need to find accommodations for the dog. \n\nSo your point becomes moot on those merits.

At its most basic form a contract just needs to involve an offer, a clear acceptance of the offer, and consideration (something given or done in exchange for what the other party offered them).
