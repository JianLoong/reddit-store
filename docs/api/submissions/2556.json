I told her my husband (23M) and I have budgeted about $30 per person for gifts. We are planning to buy gifts for my mom, dad, brother and his girlfriend, and my husband's mom, dad, and brother as well. I am also planning on buying gifts for two of my friends and my husband. My husband and I have also set limits on our gifts to each other.\n\nNow, normally each year I budget a lot more for Christmas spending and have gotten people in our families some fairly expensive gifts. But this year we are budgeting so strictly because I am moving to another country at the end of November for work, my husband may also be moving but it depends on if he can get a job there or not. So, we have a lot of expenses coming up right before Christmas.\n\nMy mom said that she thinks I shouldn't have given her a monetary number for gift ideas, and that I shouldn't tell anyone else that I am on a tighter budget this year. However, part of the reason I mentioned it to my mom is that when I had asked my MIL what she would like for Christmas she requested a fairly expensive gift, and I was hoping that the rest of my family would manage their expectations a bit considering my financial situation. To add a little more context, it isn't unusual for me to discuss my finances with my mom. She usually helps me budget and has been pretty involved in helping me prepare to move internationally. Anyways, AITA?\n\nEdit 1: To clarify, both my husband and I will be in the new country for Christmas and will not be able to spend time with either sets of parents unfortunately. I agree that part of the Christmas spirit is being able to spend the holidays with family and that's what it is really about. I was a bit taken aback by my mom's comment but based on what some of you have said I think she was just trying to keep me from offending others by \"putting a price\" on the relationships. I think it's a bit silly, but I can still understand the perspective.\n\nOn another note, I'm excited to spend my husband and I's first Christmas married alone together in another country.  I've been pushing to do some of the Christmas celebrations with our families while I'm still home but haven't gotten a lot of response back, which is disappointing, but it is what it is. \n\nHowever, in the future I'm going to try to come up with gift ideas on my own.

You can get a lot of good things for $30. A couple paperbacks. A couple CDs. A pack of illustration pens. A cool Tshirt. A video game. A makeup pallette. A small Lego kit. As long as the gift is thoughtful, the price shouldn't matter. And you were only being honest with her about your finances so that she'd know your situation.", "NTA. Frankly, I don\u2019t understand the point of giving expensive gifts to adult family members. It seems unnecessary and wasteful. I guess everyone has their traditions, but I think that as a 21 year old just starting out, a total budget of a few hundred dollars sounds reasonable. Your mom is an AH for expecting you to buy something you can\u2019t afford and for making you feel bad about it.", "NTA. You shouldn't go broke buying people gifts. If your relatives want more expensive items, they can get them themselves. By letting people know your budget, they can give you ideas that are affordable for you. Make sure anything you ask for is in that price range too.", "NTA for budgeting, everyone should be budgeting and Christmas is no exception. \n\nHowever it would be an AH move to tell people your budget and ask them to request less.  Don't ask what they want and just stick to your budget.  For MIL since you already asked just let your husband tell her you can't get that and will get something different.", "NTA. It's insane how materialistic Christmas has become.", "NTA. It's sad, isn't it, that the holidays are so materialistic? You shouldn't have to tell anyone your budget, nor apologize for it. Your gift is coming from the heart. Now, I'm a lot older than you, and I can tell you that most older adults don't like getting stuff just because it is expectd. I would rather get something homemade that is useable. How about looking up how to make canned gifts--there are recipes for putting all the dried ingredients in a mason jar. Soup mixes, brownies, hot chocolates, etc. Then make it cute and find an accessory to go with it., like a scoop for the hot chocolate or a ladle for the soup. You and your husband can have fun doing it together. Make hand made cards with heartfelt notes inside. Don't fall into the trap of having to spend more than you can afford--KUDOS to you for setting a budget ahead of time,. Whatever you decide, I wish you a wonderful holiday!", "NTA - Christmas is needlessly expensive. She should be proud that her 21 year old daughter has the good sense to stay within her financial limits.", "NAH, but your mother's point of view might just be that it's a little crass to burden others with your financial concerns at Christmas. It puts them in the position of feeling that any gift from you could be straining your budget.\n\nBuy what you can afford, that's all.", "NTA. Gifts are intended to be just that \u2014 gifts. Not obligations. \n\nYour obligation for yourself and your husband is to make sure you\u2019re meeting your needs. Sounds like you have a lot of reason to be cautious with spending. If your family can\u2019t understand, that\u2019s their problem.", "NTA. You're 21. Like, sure, you're an adult, but people shouldn't expect you to be made of money or something. The economy is shit right now. My family decided to do a $25 gift cap this year, when we usually do $50-$100. It shouldn't matter how much you're spending monetarily; it should just be about spending time with each other.", "NTA Christmas isn\u2019t for the gifts though but about spending time with family doing a variety of things baking, crafts etc. We set a universal rule in my family where we don\u2019t get gifts for adults only for the kids and kids in school.\n\nIf adults want gifts you could always do a secret Santa with wish lists and a slightly higher budget. It\u2019ll be a lot cheaper than buying multiple adults gifts and less stressful. There\u2019s also other fun gift games where you set a small budget cap for everyone, you all bring a gift within that budget and get creative with it. Once the first gift is opened, the next person has a choice to either steal the gift or open another. If you choose to steal a gift from someone that person can choose to steal another or open the next gift in a pile. The cycle continues. I forget what it\u2019s called but it\u2019s a fun and inexpensive gift game. Can be funny depending on what\u2019s in that pile. You\u2019ll make great memories. \n\nIf I want something expensive I\u2019d rather just buy it myself. I personally appreciate the thought someone puts in a gift. For example, buying my favourite coffee or tea or a unique mug etc. All those definitely less than $30.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mom should realise you're an adult with adult expenses and responsibilities and not act quite childishly over Christmas gifts. It's the thought that counts, not the $$$'s.", "NAH.\n\nYou are in the right to spend less on Christmas since you have a big expense before that. Your mom is also right in that you shouldn't tell everyone about your budget limit, because some people may take it the wrong way.\n\nJust think about what they would like, and buy something within your budget.", "NTA\n\nGifts are not obligations.  Geez, you are 21 and just starting life.  You should not need to worry about giving people expensive gifts.  \n\nWhat is it with parents thinking their kids should give them expensive stuff anyway?", "Tell your mother christmas is not about gifts! also be more grateful that she is atleast getting something rather than nothing.", "And this is why, when someone asks for a list, I give ideas for $5-100. Because if you all you afford is $5 then I\u2019m thankful and I will cherish that item and if it\u2019s $100 I\u2019m thankful and will cherish that item. The amount doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s the love that went into it.", "NTA.  A gift shouldn't have to be expensive to be thoughtful.  Budgeting on gifts is a great idea.", "NTA. Inflation is insane. On top of that, you don't owe anyone anything", "NTA. You sound perfectly reasonable to me.", "NTA, I\u2019m 22 and that\u2019s about how much I\u2019m budgeting for this year as well. Cost of everything right now is rough.", "In our family we buy gifts for mom and the kids no other Adults.  We are all grown ups who generally buy what we want when we want them anyway.  We sometimes do stockings but that\u2019s it.", "Good advice on the MIL front, I appreciate it.  \n\n I was mostly asking my mom for ideas for my dad and my brother that were within the budget I set. I'm not planning on asking anyone else what they would like or for any additional ideas, I'll just keep looking at gift idea lists on the internet.", "Maybe it\u2019s a family thing but I have no problem discussing Christmas budgets with family.", "My husband and I have been trying to come up with a fun date night idea, and I love this! Thank you!", "I love the secret santa and white elephant ideas, that's often what my friend group usually does. Maybe I can suggest that for the family next year!", "Yeah, I always have a list of $10 paperbacks or a specific color art marker I need for someone who wants to get me something small. Heck, I'd even take a $1 movie box of sweet tarts as long as they're thinking of me.", "It definitely is", "One of my favorite gifts to give is a date night or family night. I get one of the big plastic popcorn tubs (if you are in the US they have them at the dollar tree). I fill it with candy, popcorn packages, maybe some paper popcorn bags or the plastic ones if you can find them. Then I put a few Redbox rentals in it. It\u2019s an experience or two so they can spend time with people they love.", "NTA, I have like $5 per gift this year. I'll just boil some spices with sugar and everyone will get homemade sirups and caramel lol.", "NTA- one of my favorite gift i\u2019ve ever gotten was a hand bound journal. the materials were very inexpensive, but the end result was priceless to me. the thought that goes into the gift has always been more important to me than the physical object. My follow up favorite gifts are random rocks, pebbles, or found objects on the road. The fact that they saw it and thought of me. \ud83d\udda4 (I have been dubbed a raven or a rat bc of my love for shiny trinkets)", "NTA at all. I know so many people who go into major debt every Christmas, trying to buy gifts for everyone, and because they really can't afford much, don't want to look cheap. I think $30 is fine, and if people get upset over it, so be it.", "NTA. Also info: how much do you make an hour? If it's $10, then you are saying you want to spend 3 hours of labor on gifting each person, and that's a damn lot. Also it's not rude to bring up budget when someone is helping you make purchasing decisions.", "NTA...  In my family we don't give to siblings, only parents and children...  Christmas is a gift grab and a excuse for ppl to request things, they wouldn't buy themselves.  Has nothing to do with how much you love each other & not a excuse to belittle someone for something that can't afford....   If I want something that cost 15.00 then that what I'm going to ask for,( if asked.)\n\nCongratulations on the new job", "NTA - enjoy your first alone together christmas!", "It really is. I don't have a lot of people to buy for, but I buy what I can afford. My mom gets a lot of food and booze, as she enjoys both :) and is in her 80s. she needs NOTHING. anything else she gets she's specifically requested.", "I love this idea. Usually, I do a Christmas baking day each year where I make cookies, chocolate covered pretzels, hot cocoa cubes and chocolate bark and I hand them out to lots of people. I always think homemade gifts like that are so thoughtful, plus they taste amazing!!", "I'm currently in between things as I'm moving. I'm living off of my savings and my husband is working and he makes between $120-160 per day usually 4-5 days a week. I've been trying to be very careful about my spending before I move because there will be a lot of upfront costs. Once I start working again, I will be salaried, and it will be around $2,500 per month with my job covering housing expenses. If my husband moves with me, he will have to look for an entirely new job as well and then there's the cost of applying for a visa.", "Thanks! I'm excited about it.", "It\u2019s when the gift isn\u2019t thoughtful or is passive aggressive that I get annoyed. Once my sister asked me what I wanted. I told her something for my wall to hang my necklaces on bc I didn\u2019t have any counter space. She got me a huge necklace rack to put on the counter for bracelets and earrings knowing I can\u2019t wear earrings bc no matter the metal or plastic I have infections. I haven\u2019t been able to wear them in 25+ years. I kept it for 2-3 years in a box before I got rid of it. After that Christmas I went to Walmart and got a key rack for $5 and hung my necklaces on it. It wasn\u2019t the price tag. She just literally bought the one thing I asked her not to.", "NTA if it were my family they would be refusing gifts because they would know that its expensive to settle in another country.", "NTA the presents at Christmas are the least important part of the holiday. If your family is requiring a certain dollar amount to ensure a normal holiday especially considering the inflation of the world currently, you may want to consider moving to charity donations as gifts. It is still a gift without all the materialistic notions and I'm sure they would use and appreciate that 30 dollars. My family has a set limit of 30 dollars normally unless it's for a child. We also do drawings out of a hat more kin to secret Santa. If you don't want to do a limit maybe do a secret Santa, then it's only buying for one person or two if you do split family holidays. Good luck.", "NTA. $30 should be more than enough for gifts. As far as I'm concerned my family could make me homemade crafts for gifts and I'd love it, why can't families just be happy to be together over the holidays. Your budget is completely reasonable.", "NTA. You were setting boundaries and expectations - something that is wise and a good thing to do. I would be careful to not buy the MIL or the inlaws more expensive gifts than your own family.", "NTA\n\nGood grief, it's about the thought!  What is wrong with people?!?\n\nGet candles from Costco.  Or nice lotion. Or a book.  Or a box of chocolates.  $10-$20 tops.  No need to spend a lot of money.  That is NOT what Christmas is about.", "People generally have too much stuff already. For adults, we almost always go with consumables, and we prefer to receive consumables.\n\nIf you know a bit about the person, you probably know if they have something they particularly like. An unusual kind of cheese? A particular kind of wine? If you have the skills, you may even be able to make something yourself - like homemade preserves.\n\nBonus: Consumables don't need to be expensive. It's the thought that counts, or it's supposed to be...", "NTA but I suggest not asking people what they want.  Don't mention a budget at all.  Just get something thoughtful for people within your budget.\n\n$30 is our standard budget these days for Christmas and birthday gifts.  When we were even poorer it was $20.  My husband is basically *the gift whisperer,* though, which helps a lot.  Thoughtfulness goes a long way.\n\nHonestly, my family spends more than they probably should on gifts for us.  His mother spends *way* too much on us and it's uncomfortable but that's...a whole other thing.", "NTA In the past we have always shared budgets with extended family to make sure we were all on the same page, that we were reciprocating at a manageable budget for all of us, especially during difficult past times.", "NTA - why would you give people gifts for a holiday you're not there for? you're going over and above.  You're only 21 - nobody expects you to spend serious money on these !", "Seriously. \"It's the thought that counts\" is usually used ironically but it really does. If the gift is meaningful or something they enjoy or something they'll use all the time, who cares how much it costs?", "Yeah, we\u2019re going to possibly go in on it with other family members or do something else but it\u2019s definitely not something we\u2019re planning on getting at this point."]}
