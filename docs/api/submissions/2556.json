{"id": 2556, "submission_id": "yxrxd0", "title": "AITA for Telling My Mom I can only afford around $30 per person this year for Christmas Gifts?", "selftext": "Yesterday, I (21F) was talking on the phone with my mom (48F) when I asked her about what she thinks my other family members would like for Christmas. I told her my husband (23M) and I have budgeted about $30 per person for gifts. We are planning to buy gifts for my mom, dad, brother and his girlfriend, and my husband's mom, dad, and brother as well. I am also planning on buying gifts for two of my friends and my husband. My husband and I have also set limits on our gifts to each other.\n\nNow, normally each year I budget a lot more for Christmas spending and have gotten people in our families some fairly expensive gifts. But this year we are budgeting so strictly because I am moving to another country at the end of November for work, my husband may also be moving but it depends on if he can get a job there or not. So, we have a lot of expenses coming up right before Christmas.\n\nMy mom said that she thinks I shouldn't have given her a monetary number for gift ideas, and that I shouldn't tell anyone else that I am on a tighter budget this year. However, part of the reason I mentioned it to my mom is that when I had asked my MIL what she would like for Christmas she requested a fairly expensive gift, and I was hoping that the rest of my family would manage their expectations a bit considering my financial situation. To add a little more context, it isn't unusual for me to discuss my finances with my mom. She usually helps me budget and has been pretty involved in helping me prepare to move internationally. Anyways, AITA?\n\nEdit 1: To clarify, both my husband and I will be in the new country for Christmas and will not be able to spend time with either sets of parents unfortunately. I agree that part of the Christmas spirit is being able to spend the holidays with family and that's what it is really about. I was a bit taken aback by my mom's comment but based on what some of you have said I think she was just trying to keep me from offending others by \"putting a price\" on the relationships. I think it's a bit silly, but I can still understand the perspective.\n\nOn another note, I'm excited to spend my husband and I's first Christmas married alone together in another country.  I've been pushing to do some of the Christmas celebrations with our families while I'm still home but haven't gotten a lot of response back, which is disappointing, but it is what it is. \n\nHowever, in the future I'm going to try to come up with gift ideas on my own.

You can get a lot of good things for $30. A couple paperbacks. A couple CDs. A pack of illustration pens. A cool Tshirt. A video game. A makeup pallette. A small Lego kit. As long as the gift is thoughtful, the price shouldn't matter. And you were only being honest with her about your finances so that she'd know your situation.", "NTA. Frankly, I don\u2019t understand the point of giving expensive gifts to adult family members. It seems unnecessary and wasteful. I guess everyone has their traditions, but I think that as a 21 year old just starting out, a total budget of a few hundred dollars sounds reasonable. Your mom is an AH for expecting you to buy something you can\u2019t afford and for making you feel bad about it.", "NTA. You shouldn't go broke buying people gifts. If your relatives want more expensive items, they can get them themselves. By letting people know your budget, they can give you ideas that are affordable for you. Make sure anything you ask for is in that price range too.", "NTA for budgeting, everyone should be budgeting and Christmas is no exception. \n\nHowever it would be an AH move to tell people your budget and ask them to request less.  Don't ask what they want and just stick to your budget.  For MIL since you already asked just let your husband tell her you can't get that and will get something different.", "NTA. It's insane how materialistic Christmas has become.", "NTA. It's sad, isn't it, that the holidays are so materialistic? You shouldn't have to tell anyone your budget, nor apologize for it. Your gift is coming from the heart. Now, I'm a lot older than you, and I can tell you that most older adults don't like getting stuff just because it is expectd. I would rather get something homemade that is useable. How about looking up how to make canned gifts--there are recipes for putting all the dried ingredients in a mason jar. Soup mixes, brownies, hot chocolates, etc. Then make it cute and find an accessory to go with it., like a scoop for the hot chocolate or a ladle for the soup. You and your husband can have fun doing it together. Make hand made cards with heartfelt notes inside. Don't fall into the trap of having to spend more than you can afford--KUDOS to you for setting a budget ahead of time,. Whatever you decide, I wish you a wonderful holiday!", "NTA - Christmas is needlessly expensive. She should be proud that her 21 year old daughter has the good sense to stay within her financial limits.", "NAH, but your mother's point of view might just be that it's a little crass to burden others with your financial concerns at Christmas. It puts them in the position of feeling that any gift from you could be straining your budget.\n\nBuy what you can afford, that's all.", "NTA. Gifts are intended to be just that \u2014 gifts. Not obligations. \n\nYour obligation for yourself and your husband is to make sure you\u2019re meeting your needs. Sounds like you have a lot of reason to be cautious with spending. If your family can\u2019t understand, that\u2019s their problem.", "NTA. You're 21. Like, sure, you're an adult, but people shouldn't expect you to be made of money or something. The economy is shit right now. My family decided to do a $25 gift cap this year, when we usually do $50-$100. It shouldn't matter how much you're spending monetarily; it should just be about spending time with each other.", "NTA Christmas isn\u2019t for the gifts though but about spending time with family doing a variety of things baking, crafts etc. We set a universal rule in my family where we don\u2019t get gifts for adults only for the kids and kids in school.\n\nIf adults want gifts you could always do a secret Santa with wish lists and a slightly higher budget. It\u2019ll be a lot cheaper than buying multiple adults gifts and less stressful. There\u2019s also other fun gift games where you set a small budget cap for everyone, you all bring a gift within that budget and get creative with it. Once the first gift is opened, the next person has a choice to either steal the gift or open another. If you choose to steal a gift from someone that person can choose to steal another or open the next gift in a pile. The cycle continues. I forget what it\u2019s called but it\u2019s a fun and inexpensive gift game. Can be funny depending on what\u2019s in that pile. You\u2019ll make great memories. \n\nIf I want something expensive I\u2019d rather just buy it myself. I personally appreciate the thought someone puts in a gift. For example, buying my favourite coffee or tea or a unique mug etc. All those definitely less than $30.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mom should realise you're an adult with adult expenses and responsibilities and not act quite childishly over Christmas gifts. It's the thought that counts, not the $$$'s.", "NAH.\n\nYou are in the right to spend less on Christmas since you have a big expense before that. Your mom is also right in that you shouldn't tell everyone about your budget limit, because some people may take it the wrong way.\n\nJust think about what they would like, and buy something within your budget.", "NTA\n\nGifts are not obligations.  Geez, you are 21 and just starting life.  You should not need to worry about giving people expensive gifts.  \n\nWhat is it with parents thinking their kids should give them expensive stuff anyway?", "Tell your mother christmas is not about gifts! also be more grateful that she is atleast getting something rather than nothing.", "And this is why, when someone asks for a list, I give ideas for $5-100. Because if you all you afford is $5 then I\u2019m thankful and I will cherish that item and if it\u2019s $100 I\u2019m thankful and will cherish that item. The amount doesn\u2019t matter.

Maybe I can suggest that for the family next year!", "Yeah, I always have a list of $10 paperbacks or a specific color art marker I need for someone who wants to get me something small.

I get one of the big plastic popcorn tubs (if you are in the US they have them at the dollar tree). I fill it with candy, popcorn packages, maybe some paper popcorn bags or the plastic ones if you can find them. Then I put a few Redbox rentals in it.
