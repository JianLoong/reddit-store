Try talking to your parents and see if they can try to support her or get through to her, but it can\u2019t be your responsibility anymore.

First, you rejected him (rightfully so, he's a creep). Second, you can't dictate what your sister does with guys you reject. \n\nYes, it's not cool, but the fact that you're far more invested in her sniffing around your \"leftovers\" than her general safety is more telling of you than her. for this reason I'm going ESH.", "He is a creep and needs to STAY AWAY.

He's basically still stalking you through her. This is dangerous for both of you", "Your sister is playing with fire knowingly. A dude doesn't just dump that kind of cash on a girl and not expect something in return, especially if she is accepting it.

Which makes me even more frustrated because it\u2019s like she is supporting that obsessive behavior by being a listening ear.", "No she is not. He knows it\u2019s her and not me. I know from her that he consistently asks to hang out to which she at least rejects (for now). He once even asked her what my favorite fruit is so he could send me a gift basket.", "She did tell him about my recent drug overdose and me going sober. I didn\u2019t want him to know any of that, that is personal stuff. I\u2019m a very private person when it comes to these matters so I was very hurt when I found that out.\n\nMy parents want nothing to do with our issues.", "You wouldn\u2019t catch me dead at any place he will be at. Guy gives me the total creeps. He wrote a five page paper about why he loves me and even included pictures of me I didn\u2019t know he had.

Have you spoken to your parents about this matter?", "Oh jeez, a five page letter? He's unhinged. I'm closer to his age than yours and men like him pursue women your age because they often think they're easier to manipulate and control. You've obviously proven him wrong. Hold on to that letter in case you need proof to show the police that he's obsessed. He could have gone after any woman but he specifically chose your sister. And she's an asshole to compromise your safety. Maybe you should block her on social media because he might try to access your pictures through her. Good luck. I'm sorry you're going through this. I hope it gets bigger soon. And be careful going anywhere alone.", "Obviously I wasn't talking about OP but her sister and she clearly isn't 21 now.", "Yawn. I guess there's more weak willed people than I thought.", "Doesn't matter. They are still adults and you can't groom an adult. Manipulate yes, groom no. I only see this kind of thinking online, I guess there's a reason for that.", "Seems to me like it's more important to her to date  guys you've rejected then to keep herself safe.  if she knows all the facts and it isn't having an effect then I don't think there's anything else you can do.", "Distance  yourself  asap from your sister  adn avoid  giving  her information  about  your life.

A college professor could absolutely groom a student. It's just about a power imbalance where they form/force an emotional connection that they later will exploit (usually) sexually.\n\nIt doesn't happen as often with adults because an age gap between an adult and a child is the most common way for this to happen.\n\nI myself am a survivor of child sexual assault and still understand adults can be groomed.

Are your parents able to recognize that your sister has some emotional issues? Would they be willing to intervene in this matter? Can you switch schools without revealing it to your sister? I suspect that this guy is pursuing her to get to you and will follow her to your school. You need to get distance from her so that she can develop her own life and from him in order to stay safe.
