He didn\u2019t take that lightly and continued to harass and stalk me for the next few months, texting me things from random numbers saying he wants me to \u201csit on his face.\u201d Ew.\n\nFast forward to now, I finally got him off my back (or so I thought) because I just found out today that my own twin sister has been texting him for months and receiving gifts from him.\n\nOf course I flipped out. He harassed and stalked me. He made me feel uncomfortable. I don\u2019t understand why my sister thinks it\u2019s OKAY to keep in contact with him? I feel like this should be obvious to her.\n\nDo I have the right to be peeved?\n\nEdit: Yes, this guy is a creep, and my sister is fully aware of it. Just to give an example, I had a babysitting job with an adorable 5 year old girl and she loved taking selfies with me on my phone. Mama of said girl posted a few of those pictures to her instagram, to which the creep later admitted to finding and jerking off to. My sister knows all of this. Yes, I am concerned for her safety but for some reason she just WON\u2019T listen to me.", "created_utc": 1676342179, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111rjqa/aita_for_demanding_my_sister_stops_talking_to_the/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Talk to her one more time to see if you can get though to her. Be open about how you will need to move forward and distance yourself if she continues to be in contact with him. If she still contacts him, you really need to follow through and distance yourself. Try talking to your parents and see if they can try to support her or get through to her, but it can\u2019t be your responsibility anymore.

It is not safe for you to be associated with anything involving him, which unfortunately now includes your sister.", "Sounds like she does it because they are emotionally attached to you but not with her.

First, you rejected him (rightfully so, he's a creep). Second, you can't dictate what your sister does with guys you reject. \n\nYes, it's not cool, but the fact that you're far more invested in her sniffing around your \"leftovers\" than her general safety is more telling of you than her. for this reason I'm going ESH.", "He is a creep and needs to STAY AWAY.

She's deliberately going after guys that you find problematic, I'm pretty sure she's actually doing it to get back at you. Your sister isn't who you think she is, and she certainly has some serious issues around you - jealousy for one. Take off your blinders and I'm sure you'll find other instances where she's gone after things you wanted or that put you in an uncomfortable situation - jobs, school opportunities, friends...", "But you're also upset that she's going after guys you've rejected. You're not just concerned about her safety. You have a twisted interest in this as well.", "To me, it is a shameful thing to do. She can do better than going after men I reject, especially when they\u2019ve already been introduced to the family."]}
