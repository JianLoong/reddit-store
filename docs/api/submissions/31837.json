There's also a very high risk it will ruin your future credit, *when* not *if* he stops making his payments... considering it's pretty hard to be blacklisted from ever getting a mortgage loan.

Much more likely niece is making some or all of the payments and is tired of the financial burden. Plus, it\u2019s basically the FIL\u2019s house , regardless of what the paperwork says.
