Even if only he goes on FILs mortgage that will be terrible for you. \n\n\nSEE A LAWYER **TODAY** and have them explain why you are 100% correct that this is financial suicide for you (and for your husband, but fuck that guy). Have the lawyer advise you on how to protect yourself if your husband goes through with putting his name on the mortgage, and/or if he forges your name onto it too.\n\n\nAnd start on a divorce.\n\nWhy are you not already divorcing him for his abuse?\n\n\nNTA", "Divorce papers are the only legal documents you should be signing.

This situation sounds like it is not only a detriment to your personal happiness and mental health, but is on track to ruin your financial health.

You'd be on the hook for the FIL, and he's been blacklisted for a reason, so you should consider the debt burden yours and your husband's alone. Your FIL will have 0 accountability to that debt - you'll be able to yell at him, but that's it. The bank would sue you, it would be your credit, and likely your entire life to repair the damage from a failed mortgage. \n\nBut your husband is most certainly not a good guy. He's an awful husband and sounds like a terrible man. So you need to think about that relationship seriously. Being tied to him for a 25 year debt doesn't sound prudent.", "Please get legal and financial advice.  This whole situation has great risk to you financially. Why are you with this man? Please get support and consider whether you want to live the rest of your life like this, the longer you stay the harder it will be to leave, especially if you are financially committed to a mortgage or have children.", "NTA.  From a financial point of view, putting your name on the mortgage opens you to a heap of financial problems.  You are financially responsible and you just know your FIL will eventually stop paying.  Plus, nowhere do you indicate your name will be on the deed or title.  This is a financial disaster waiting to happen.\n\nMore importantly and more urgent is the way your husband treats you.
