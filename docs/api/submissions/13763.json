I told him the truth: that I divorced her because I found out that she cheated on me.\n\nA few days ago, I found out that my son had been acting aloof around his mother and called her a \"hoe.\" I found out when she started blowing up my phone asking if I \"told him anything about our marriage\" and demanding to know what I told him.\n\nI tend to leave her on read for all non-essential inquiries, so I didn't respond at first. But then she called me and exploded. I told her that I felt that our son was old enough to know the answer to his question and I wasn't going to lie to him. Besides, if she didn't want to be known by people as a cheater, she could've easily accomplished that goal by not cheating.\n\nAt that point, she threatened to tell our son that I did a paternity test on him during the divorce process and would have \"abandoned him\" if it came back negative.

This is not gonna be good on him or his mental health", "Wow! I can't believe all the victim blaming in the comments. guess I'm going to get major down votes, but here goes. For 15 years you have kept her dark secret. I don't know if he directly asked years ago or not, but at some point this was going to come out. I don't know why everyone expects you to lie to your son.\n\nPlus, if you did lie and then he finds out another way (I'm sure lots of older family members know the truth) then he would feel like he can't really trust you. He would certainly wonder what else have you lied to him about. This is no white lie either. These types of lies shake the foundation of where a person comes from and what they believe to be true about their lives. The truth is hard to deal with sometimes, but it's still the truth. And everyone deserves the truth in their lives. We deserve to grieve and then do the work to rebuild the relationships if we chose to.\n\nShe broke up a family unit and she needs to deal with the consequences. I'm sure she's had plenty of grief and guilt over what she did and maybe even got decimated in the divorce financially. Some of that may have helped you grieve and rebuild your life. However, you are not the only one hurt by her actions. Your son was deprived of a nuclear family unit. She has to ask for forgiveness from her son as well. Just because 15 years has passed, this doesn't make things right for her son.\n\nYes, he is pissed off. Yes, he is acting out. Yes, he should be in therapy to deal with all these new emotions he has likely NEVER experienced before. But none of that changes the fact the he has a right to know things that affected his life drastically and dramatically. If they both do the work, they will get through this. It will take some time and there will be lots of hurt feelings on both sides at times. But in the long run, they have to deal with this in order to have a strong relationship moving forward.

And your son will feel the same.\n\nHOWEVER, address the name calling. That's serious. And don't encourage it.

I did not tell him about the emotional and physical abuse at that point but he jut really wanted to know why because he couldn't figure his Dad's narrative about me with what he saw every day.", "ESH.  Look, I get it.  I dealt with a painful divorce myself. There was nothing I wanted more for YEARS than the moment when my child would \u201cchoose me over her.\u201d  The temptation to unload all of the pain from the divorce and let a teenager respond like a teen will was very difficult to suppress.  \n\nBut, after years, I came to a realization.  It was in my son\u2019s best interest to have a good relationship with his mother, no matter how she had wronged me (or I had wronged her.)  Like OP\u2019s son, my kid started asking questions. \n\n\u201cListen.  I\u2019m your father and I love you.  Just like your mother loves you.  That\u2019s all that\u2019s really important, isn\u2019t it?  Do you really want the details of our relationship?  That relationship is over, and that was the best outcome for us.

That language is not ok.  And of course your ex needs to recognize the truth was going to come out eventually.  \n\nI don\u2019t care about the downvotes.  Life isn\u2019t black or white very often.  Sometimes parents need to make sacrifices for our kids.  (ETA: That\u2019s what divorced co-parenting is: sacrifices)", "NTA. You simply told him the truth and he was going to find out eventually.

Congratulations for damaging your child. What happened between you and your wife shouldn\u2019t have been a topic of discussion. Alternatively, We grew apart and I just couldn\u2019t see us together anymore, but we still love you very much. You didn\u2019t need to confess to your son.

But a 15-year-old is still a child, and that\u2019s a serious amount of hurt he might be feeling. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH by telling the truth. I just am curious if you knew what his reaction might be, which is why you told him now, and not when he was older/not as a conversation as coparents.

But I also, deep down, knew that guy was screwing up (he had other, vastly more serious, issues). I also knew my mother had been with other men as well (she married her boss when I was 5\u2026) and that was conflicting. In the end, I couldn\u2019t trust either parent, especially with back-and-forth badmouthing. And despite being 15, I wouldn\u2019t want your kid to feel - caught in between? Kids do that. What your ex did was AWFUL. But it was 14 years ago. The sting will be newer to him, whereas you\u2019ve had time to let it cool.\n\nMy point is that kids aren\u2019t stupid and they should be told the truth. I agree with you on that.

Besides, if she didn't want to be known by people as a cheater, she could've easily accomplished that goal by not cheating.\n\nAt that point, she threatened to tell our son that I did a paternity test on him during the divorce process and would have \"abandoned him\" if it came back negative.

That said, he is 15. What would you have the OP say to the question, \" Why did you and mom divorce?\"?  Your mom cheated on me is factually correct and not graphic. \n\nOP, as your son is clearly taking this hard and as much as you have every right to feel, however you feel about your ex, it might be worth getting your son to speak to someone to help him work through his feelings. I could care less how your ex feels about her son knowing why you divorced, but you don't want him to hold onto negative feelings in general about women. Calling your mother a hoe isn't a healthy way of approaching his valid feelings.

Who in gods name would prevent their kid from knowing why their parents got divorced? It\u2019s their own parents, I think they have the right to know. It honestly amazes me that OP didn\u2019t tell his son earlier, I don\u2019t know how you go 15 years without telling your kid that.

I suppose I'd use language like \"they made bad choices\" or \"they did something that hurt me\" for a young child and then as they get older explain more.

Then they can all have worse relationships, but hey everyone was super honest and that the most important value right.", "A 15 year old has a very limited understanding of the real world. He is going to hear this and think cheating = bad = mom = bad. That is not fair to HIM. This revelation is not necessarily wrong to do, but it need more than one throwaway sentence.

This kid is both of them.", "It's the OP's statement of cause. We don't know what was going on with mom. Maybe OP was as toxic then as his tone is now. Maybe she had PPD and he was unsupportive.

What if OP was just a pot smoking unemployed neckbeard and she just couldn\u2019t take it anymore?\n\nNone of that *should* matter but I bet for many here it would.

I just think it's not up to the son to punish his mother for something that happened before he could walk or talk. If the cheating went on for the last few years and he just found out,  then ok,  but this isn't his battle. Unless the cheating resulted in him living a horrible life that could have been prevented if his parents had stayed together,  then maybe. Perhaps OP left that part out.

That's what happens when two people have a child together and their relationship doesn't work out. There are no winners here, no perfect pretty picture. Not sure why you came at me so aggressively, but have the day you deserve I guess\n\nEdit to add - I also don't think dad answering a question about the reason the marriage ended is comparable with mom threatening to tell the son that dad did a paternity test and would have left if it was negative. The son asked a question and the dad gave an honest answer. Mom is saying she will tell the son about the paternity test in retaliation to the dad telling the son the truth. Although that also may be the truth, she is saying it in retaliation to hurt in hopes to hurt the dad's relationship with the son. It's the old \"well, since you did that, I'm gonna do this! Tit for tat!\" Dad also told the son when he was ASKED. Regardless, I stand by my comment that they need to go to therapy to address this situation", "After he found out what was going on he should of sat down with son and told him that its absolutely okay to have strong feelings about the new information he was told, but that it is not okay to disrespect his mother.", "It\u2019s a gendered expression and she wasn\u2019t a sex worker, she cheated.

That's not how people work, dude.", "This is just lying with extra steps, my friend.", "Dad: \u201cyour mom did something where I couldn\u2019t trust her anymore.\u201d\n\n15-year-old, somehow: \u201cokay, I\u2019ll accept that and won\u2019t ask what she did.\u201d\n\nReally?\n\nYour options work for a 5-year-old, not a 15-year-old.", "This is just lying", "Eh. Also depends on how op's son interprets things. For some people they would interpret all of those a lot worse then just knowing the truth. At 15 it would have been better to tell me the truth then try to gloss over it like that. Considering we don't know how the son views things it does kind of make it uncertain.  I'm personally a fan of the truth when possible, just done gently with age appropriate details.  Which it sounds like op did to me.", "This!", "Realistically OPs son could have already found out from family/friends which prompted him to question his dad about the divorce. If OP continued to cover for his cheating ex and lied to his son, it would be another huge blow for that poor kid followed by years of trust issues with his parents.", "Teenagers date and deal with cheating as well. No need to keep it from him until he\u2019s an adult.", "He takes that information and learns NOT to do what his mother did. He now understands the pain he was feeling comes from the decision of 1 parent for being unfaithful.", "No it doesn\u2019t. Not 15 years later.", "read the rest of the comment thread.", "also i just want to say that i recently found out that i was born in a similar situation, except my parents didn't get a divorce because my mom found out she was pregnant with me. they stayed together but ended up divorcing when i was 17 because they just weren't a good pair. \n\ni am 37 years old and that information knocked me on my ass. i cried for a week. if i found that out in a nasty way when i was 15, i don't know what i would have done, but it might have been really bad. 15 year olds are not emotionally mature people.", "They may know that you aren't the OP, but responded to you so their comment is higher up. I see that a lot on Reddit.", "If you go on google you can find so many good therapist to help you out. \u2764\ufe0f", "I respect your opinion on this thank you! We all don\u2019t think the same and I just gave my opinion on it. So thanks for taking the time to respond the way you did without resorting to calling me a cheater. \u263a\ufe0f", "Agree to disagree. Hopefully brutal untactful honesty works in your life and everyone around you.", "None of the options listed were lying, not even by omission.", "He can ask the mom and make it her responsibility or maybe just maybe be and adult and tell them you\u2019re bot going to go into details. Geez, kids don\u2019t need to know every gory detail of their family tree as teenagers.", "OP description of the sons response is a good indicator of how he interpreted it. It is also a shitty co-parenting move.", "And yet it\u2019s only moms dirty laundry that has been shared\u2026", "Except children don't work like that. Take a child developmental course please.", "She brought up how he questioned paternity so yeah, still an AH 15 years later. Wants an eye for an eye. ANY sane person would want a paternity on their 1 year old if they found out their partner was a duplicitous cheater.\n\nOP also has zero tact.", "i already addressed this same thing", "I'm not really going to.\n\nSounds like your solution is basically \"lie to your son\".\n\nIf not, what would you rather this man tell his son so that the truth is \"kind\" (whatever that means)", "As long as I stay away from people like you I\u2019ll be just fine \u2764\ufe0f", "We all have different life experiences. I try to answer understanding that.\n\nI hope you are never betrayed like this.", "Nobody is talking about \u201cbrutal untactful honesty\u201d except you. That\u2019s such a weak tactic (characterizing OPs response this negatively) to try and win an argument.", "Being brutally honest like this never works for the people around them. Mostly children. A 15 year old isn't an adult and can't process emotions, so they resort to acting out exactly like OPs son is. These comments saying \"well he's honest, and she shouldn't have cheated\" aren't actally thinking what's best for the child. Which is most important here", "I was always someone that preferred a harsh truth to a pleasant lie. If I asked a question, I would prefer someone to be honest by giving a clear and concise answer instead of beating around the bush. Even if the answer was that they preferred not to answer. However, I'd try to find it out another way. If someone lied to me, the trust is broken, and I would never fully trust them again.", "And that is a problem how? The kid wanted to know why they got divorce, he gave him the truthful answer. No amount of ointment would make that pill easier to swallow. \n\nKid wanted to know and lying about why is way more fucking evil than just telling the truth.", "all you have to do, is keep reading. literally. i know you can type. so just do the opposite of that and read", "Doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s enough. Go on google babe start those sessions. \u2764\ufe0f", "I have been. I just learned to grow and move past that so it didn\u2019t affect me later in life which I get not everyone is like that. So I just answer the way I see things and the experiences I\u2019ve had. Sometimes people will agree and sometimes they won\u2019t, that\u2019s life. Again, thank you!", "Only if you join me so you can correct that mindset of your babe \u2764\ufe0f"]}
