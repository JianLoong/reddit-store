Derek and mollie have been dating over a year. Derek and I are roommates so I\u2019ve known mollie for awhile. She\u2019s a nice girl but has this attitude of she\u2019s always right. I find her a little annoying but Derek loves her and I support him so I\u2019m friends with her. She\u2019s a really good person I will say and comes from a great family. Which includes her sister Courtney, who I have met once or twice. \n\nAbout a month ago Derek asked me what I thought about Courtney. I said she was hot and really down to earth and I\u2019ve had good times whenever she goes out with us. Derek said mollie wanted him to ask me that. I said I wasn\u2019t interested in her due to her history. But if she wanted to ever hangout or something casual she could have my number. Derek reported back to mollie and the last few weeks have been awkward. Mollie seems standoffish. I bought her a beer and asked her what was wrong last week. She said she didn\u2019t like what I said about her sister. I said that her sister had been married before, was pregnant and got divorced. It was too much baggage for me. I thought it all was good after we talked. \n\nLast weekend mollie hosted a game night at Courtney\u2019s house. She made a big to do about this game night and kept asking if I was gonna come. I told her maybe. I had other plans that night so I might stop by. I went out for a drink and then decided to stay home and watch a game. At 8pm mollie started texting me asking when I was coming. I started ignoring her and then she called like 3 times. Derek started texting me too and I told him that I didn\u2019t want to go over to Courtney\u2019s for some couples game night and wanted to watch the game. He said it was duo games only so they needed me. I said that I said maybe to begin with so they should find other games. Mollie called me one last time on Derek\u2019s phone. She sounded mad and was like telling me to come. I told her to fuck off and leave me alone. Derek texted me yesterday and said I should apologize to her and her sister. As Courtney was the one without a partner and went and got my specific beers that I liked. I said that it wasn\u2019t my fault, I never gave a yes and never told anyone to get me anything.

It is okay to decline dating someone for whatever reason. \"It doesn't work for me\" is reason enough. It sounds as if they've taken your reasons to not want to date the sister as \"objections\" to be overcome, the attitude of a salesperson. In such cases, repeating your boundary, \"I am not interested in dating (name)\" without giving reasons or defenses works best. They know your reasons. They don't respect your boundary. They were tricking you into a double date. Your consistency foiled their plan. They were counting on you to go along to be nice while violating your stated boundaries.", "ESH.\n\nYou learned you should give a firm answer, and that is not a big request. Especially if you know people want you there. It is rude and, frankly, immature.\n\nThey should have left you alone once you said no, and just remember that if you had clearly been up front or forth coming with a firm answer this could have been avoided.", "ESH.

Nobody is truly without fault here and nobody is truly terrible. Yeah, it's kind of annoying that Mollie keeps trying to set you up with her sister and isn't taking no for an answer. Yes, you should have probably just said \"no\" up front to Mollie's party. Yes, it was a bit much telling Mollie to \"f off\". Everyone could be better.\n\nHonestly, if you don't apologize to Mollie, I think you'll find that you and your roommate start to have problems. That doesn't mean you have to do more than apologize for being rude on the phone. In my head, it's something like this:\n\n*I'm sorry I told you to \"f off\" over the phone. I really wasn't in the mood to go out that night or get set up for a surprise date with your sister, but you guys weren't taking \"no\" for an answer.

If that pregnancy went to term, OP is absolutely in the clear for knowing that he doesn't want to be a stepfather right now and not getting involved with someone with a kid.\n\nAfter that, Derek, Mollie, and Courtney don't seem to understand boundaries.

In the past he has clearly communicated that he is NOT interested, end of story.", "I don't think he's an AH for having a preference not to date divorced people. It's his dating life, his call. The second Mollie heard OP doesn't date divorc\u00e9es, she should've wanted better for her sister Courtney. She's making her sister appear desperate by pushing it when from OP's description, it's clear if Courtney keeps doing Courtney, she will find her person and it isn't OP.", "Divorced once I guess is ok. Maybe she was young and stupid, but divorced multiple times and I start asking what's her problem. And then raising another man's kid is an absolute no no for me.

Too much.\n\nTelling f off wasn't much at all though since they weren't taking a polite no for an answer. As far as I read it right, you say that in your 'apology'. Sure it was rude but no ruder than what they were doing after a NO. This would be super creepy if a man tried to force a woman into this, frankly.

It\u2019s best to just shut them down.", "NTA, If Courtney was interested in you, she should speak up. Mollie and Derek should stop playing matchmaker and let it happen naturally. Not force it which is what is happening here.", "NTA. She's not taking no for an answer because she IS setting you up with her sister whether you like it or not.  Your buddy kinda screwed you a little telling his girlfriend word for word what you said. No biggie.

They suck.", "NTA IF we\u2019re being quite frank, this is harassment plain and simple.", "NTA. Mollie is trying to force you into a relationship with her PREGNANT sister? She's got a lot of control issues, but none of them are your responsibility. Courtney is just caught in the middle and that is unfortunate.

Say no, that way your evening can always open up if you want to hang out. \n\nUnfortunately by creating a grey area with the words you might stop by. It just screws you over. Don't do this again, especially now that you know they have an agenda. \n\nYou need to tell him that you're angry and upset that they knew you had plans and you said you might drop by if things end early. What they did was unexcusable, and ask how he'd feel if you started blowing up their phone when they were out because you wanted them to be home. \n\nTell them this is made worse by the fact that they then tried to guilt you using Courtney. Which leads you to believe they didn't want you there to hang out but because they're trying to push you to pursue Courtney for a FWBs situation. \n\nThen tell them Courtney is an adult, if she's happy having casual sex she can contact you and tell you that.\n\nIt sounds like if you plan on being friends with roommate, you're going to have to start disappearing on \"dates\". Because they don't understand boundaries.", "NTAH< Mollie sounds like she is 15 not 26. I bet she is telling your buddy that it would be amazing if you dated her sister and then you all could double date and all that fun stuff.

In no way are you in the wrong for having expectations for a potential partners, but your friend was kind of an AH for letting details slip to his gf. He could\u2019ve simply said you weren\u2019t interested. They\u2019re also AH\u2019s for being annoying and pushy for you to come spend time with them. They don\u2019t respect your boundaries. Period.", "NTA\n\nNo is a complete answer and sentence. They should have listened to you before when you said you weren't interested.

I said I wasn\u2019t interested in her due to her history.  If she wanted to ever hangout or something casual she could have my number.\" AKA, you would have fun but nothing past that. But I feel like half of the people on earth would say \"..so there's a chance\", including Courtney.\n\nAbout the night: \"She made a big to do about this game night and kept asking if I was gonna come.

Say yes or no.\n\nThey should have caught on by now about how free-spirited and noncommittal you are, and shouldn't have harrassed you about not being there.

So you say not interested. Molly demands to know why, you explain, and then she tries a secret setup? Because that's going to work?

But I also won\u2019t disregard the possibility they were all trying to force him to a situation where they think he will fall in love with her against his will if he \u201cjust gives her a chance\u201d lol which seems like the more likely case here", "He laid out the reasons why he didn't want to date her.  That part is the truth.  As for the reasons themselves, the whole way people choose partners is an opinion.  It's subjective and based completely on preferences.  If you don't want to date a divorced person with kid/s, then you don't.", "Im pro choice, but for the sake of argument if OP is prolife and strongly against abortion it is kind of his business if his partner had one in the past. If my wife had done something I found morally wrong in the past, even if half of society didnt agree, I would still want to know.", "I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm trying to point out to everyone going OH HE CANT HAVE PREFERENCES???? That literally no one said that, and the criticism was for the way the poster interpreted the phrasing he used to express it because they think it may mean something about OP as a person", "Was supposed to be a living metaphor for Israel abandoning their monotheistic religion and \"whoring themselves out\" to other Gods.", "Fuck we don't even need to enter the abortion debate. Just think where a 24 year old is in life. Nowhere near marriage or kids. Totally understandable\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: He is 27", "That\u2019s true. I did notice that OP summed it up as baggage, without getting into detail about the baggage (respectful, imo). He probably knows way more than we do and had good reason to keep distance. However, he also implied that he would not mind acting as a friend if she needed someone to hang out with (other people assume for hooking up but that\u2019s not an assumption I\u2019m going to jump into quickly, maybe he really does just mean she has his number if she needs to talk or whatever). He likes her as a person but doesn\u2019t want a relationship, which he is right not to jump into if the wounds are fresh. You are right in that he could word it differently to avoid the tough conversation about pasts and baggage altogether. She may take it personally but I think in time, when she has had time to accept it, maybe she will realize she wasn\u2019t ready to jump into a relationship so soon either", "Idk man, calling on someone else's phone after your calls are clearly being ignored is going a little overboard. Fuck off may be a bit curt but it's not unjustified.", "Also ESH for giving his reasoning. He could have said \u201cshe\u2019s pretty cool but I\u2019m not interested in her romantically\u201d. Yes she probably does have baggage but he didn\u2019t need to voice it that way. It just comes out as a shallow reason.", "WE NEED TO KNOW", "Maybe autocorrect picks up the other names as names but Mollie is unconventional spelling compared to Molly?", ">I mean you sound kinda misogynistic in your views about women. You seem to think it's a moral failing on the fault of the sister for a failed marriage and not her ex husband. \n\nNo that's your sexist projection. Also why is it the moral failing of the husband? \n\nHe is 24, single, never been married and never touched the subject of kids. This woman has. They are not at the same stage in life. But of course we all know when OP has preferences it is a red flag /s", "You recognize the name I see. My favorite movie of all time!", "We dont know if it was an abortion or a miscarriage.\n\nTook a good year for my wife to greive a miscarriage, both can be very tramatic.  \n\nIt was a tough year, but we made it.", "The \"I'm down for something casual\" is where he went off the rails, don't tell that to someone about their sister, that's weird. Just say you don't want to date her, period. Your friend's gf is never hoping to set you up with a booty call with her sister.", "It\u2019s not just about the divorce though. What if he doesn\u2019t want to be a parent? Or in any role of importance to a child? NTA *at all*. If you aren\u2019t interested in that, don\u2019t date pregnant women or women with children.", "Well, and if he said \"No way\" then it is \"What is wrong with my sister?!\"", "Can confirm. Use to get felt up by older women at the gym I use to go to in my teens and early 20s. I was called a faggot when I complained to management.", "Did they edit? Because I dont see anything about wanting to sleep with her", "But they\u2019re all software developers so it\u2019s even worse lol.", "Friendship is friendship.\n\n\"Casual\" is sex with no strings.\n\nNobody ever feels the need to make a point about how \"casual\" their friendships are. It's not even a concept that is discussed. And yeah, that was a shitty thing to say about someone's sister. However, it was also shitty to try to push the guy. They all deserve one another.\n\nThe way this guy called a team board game \"couple stuff\" tells me he's not even capable of friendship. Poor girl and her friends just wanted to be seen as people, but they also have to see this guy for what he is too. He's a person with no interest. Not in anything good, anyway.", "oh I thought he was saying that she was pregnant at the time that his friend asked him about her, not that she had been pregnant at one time. which made sense to me, I would not want to date someone who was currently pregnant if it wasn't planned between the two of us", "This girl may just have shit taste in men that doesn\u2019t exactly need to be baggage. Like I\u2019m sorry but the way women are looked down on when it\u2019s socially acceptable for men to watch weird AF incest porn just pisses me off. Why is only one of these socially acceptable to judge?", "Username checks out", "Yta, not dating a divorced woman is kinda a red flag, but at least you was honest. The main issue is how you approached The Game Night situation.", "You\u2019re too old for this \u201cmaybe\u201d crap.  Grow up and say no if you mean no\n\nYTA", "Mostly NTA, they overreacted and you\u2019re not obligated to compensate for their lack of planning. \n\nHOWEVER, you\u2019re also sorta the AH for ignoring her calls not making it clear that you\u2019re not going ASAP. Also the fact that you decided to bring up the sister\u2019s history, knowing full well that your friend was going to report to Mollie, is an AH move.", "You're very judgemental and in general an asshole, but NTA for this specific event.", "Yta for writing \"Mollie\" with the first letter as capital only once!!!\n\nOther than that, NTA, not at all", "YTA. Not for what you said about the sister but for being flaky about your plans (you\u2019re a grown man, give a yes or no answer and stop ducking calls) and for telling his girlfriend to fuck off. Could\u2019ve just gave a nice good firm no and ended the conversation.", "INFO\n\nIs Mollie not a person like Courtney and Derek?  You capitalize every name every time but not Mollie.  Except at the start of a sentence.  Seems deliberate.  Or a find/replace error?\n\nNTA for not showing up since you didn\u2019t commit to it, and for wanting her to leave you alone.  Use more polite language and people might be less likely to get all butthurt?\n\nYou are a bit of a goober for the tone of the divorced and kid comment though.  Somebody pregnant and divorcing their husband is not doing it on a whim.  They\u2019re afraid or desperate or at the end of their rope.  A kid isn\u2019t baggage either.  Too much responsibility/commitment for you to be interested, fine.  But trauma and a kid aren\u2019t baggage.  That\u2019s dismissive.", "NTA- Although calling someone's past \"baggage\" just because they've been in a marriage before and pregnant is kind of rude af. People have lives, ya know? So basically what you told Derek was that you think Courtney is hot enough to have sex with but not a relationship because of her past. Do you own a microphone by any chance? It's totally OK to have preferences and not want to get involved with someone IF there's some drama going on but your views on women are a little ick. \nYou're definitely NTA here in the main situation because Derek and Mollie are essentially forcing you onto Courtney and I'm wondering if Courtney even knows about this? It isn't ok to try to force people to be together and it's really none of their business. They set up a game night, you told them you had plans and MIGHT go. You said MAYBE. And they still expected you to show up and Mollie planned this whole evening around the fact that you would be paired up with her sister. That's not cool. Why she would still push for you two to be together knowing how you feel about her sister is beyond me. She's crossing boundaries here and you might want to talk to her and Derek and just let them know that you like her and she's cool but you don't want to be forced into anything with her and you're just friends and want to have fun and they need to respect that. As far as hot Courtney goes, if she is down for something casual, cool. But make that crystal clear if that's where things go. You don't want anybody to get hurt. Just be honest. They were really badgering you about being there and I would have been super annoyed as well. Have a chat with them calmly and hopefully they can respect where you're coming from.", "ESH. You should have just said no, and she should have just taken no for the answer it was. Also if you respect her at all, why can\u2019t you capitalize your friend\u2019s name?", "YTA. Don\u2019t say you will \u201cmaybe\u201d come to a small game night, decide not to attend, and continue saying you \u201cmaybe\u201d will come - I think you knew they didn\u2019t have 20 people over there when they suggested you attend. You could play as friends only, not a romantic couple. Platonic friendships exist. If watching the game was important, I\u2019m sure there was a TV or laptop or tablet at Courtney\u2019s that could be set up to show the game. What strikes me here is your complete lack of effort to be clear and direct with your communication. If you didn\u2019t realize it was a couples game night then you could\u2019ve put in some degree (any degree) of effort to improve their night. For example, say politely at the BEGINNING of the evening \u201cI regretfully cannot attend but pizza is on me\u201d then Venmo $25 to your friend.", "Ngl if a woman said she didn\u2019t want to date someone who was divorced with a kid, Redditors would be much more lenient smh. When I was single, that was a non-negotiable for me. I did not want to date a dad. Didn\u2019t matter how great he was, it wasn\u2019t something I was open to because of the responsibilities that came with it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an issue with that. The way OP talked about it was crass, but he (thought) he was just talking to his friend. If he knew it was going to be broadcasted, May not have been so straightforward. NTA", "Unless mollie asked him, why would he just tell her he is not interested? He answered the person who asked the question.", "I mean don\u2019t pretend that\u2019s the only thing holding him back tho, she\u2019s also *pregnant* which changes things significantly.", "Or a crazy ex husband.", "Divorced people are people, too. More than just statistics. Of course he has every right to say no, she didn't even have to be divorced for him to say no. But him saying \"I still want to bang\" was Hella out of line. And so way being so flakey and narcissistic about this next hang out (Board games are a double date now? Tf?!)", "Being divorced shouldn't be any kind of red flag on its own.  Someone who's divorced multiple times maybe.  But I'm sure there are just as many divorced women who are better for it and won't make the same mistakes again as there are women who are doomed to have their relationships continue to fail for whatever reason.", "Not to mention they are all pretty young divorced at 40 is a lot different then divorced in your 20s.", "Bro gave multiple sources of data showing that the this sub is heavily biased in favour of women and gets downvoted without explanation.
