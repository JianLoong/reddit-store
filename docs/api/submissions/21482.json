Derek and mollie have been dating over a year. Derek and I are roommates so I\u2019ve known mollie for awhile. She\u2019s a nice girl but has this attitude of she\u2019s always right. I find her a little annoying but Derek loves her and I support him so I\u2019m friends with her. She\u2019s a really good person I will say and comes from a great family. Which includes her sister Courtney, who I have met once or twice. \n\nAbout a month ago Derek asked me what I thought about Courtney. I said she was hot and really down to earth and I\u2019ve had good times whenever she goes out with us. Derek said mollie wanted him to ask me that. I said I wasn\u2019t interested in her due to her history. But if she wanted to ever hangout or something casual she could have my number. Derek reported back to mollie and the last few weeks have been awkward. Mollie seems standoffish. I bought her a beer and asked her what was wrong last week. She said she didn\u2019t like what I said about her sister. I said that her sister had been married before, was pregnant and got divorced. It was too much baggage for me. I thought it all was good after we talked. \n\nLast weekend mollie hosted a game night at Courtney\u2019s house. She made a big to do about this game night and kept asking if I was gonna come. I told her maybe. I had other plans that night so I might stop by. I went out for a drink and then decided to stay home and watch a game. At 8pm mollie started texting me asking when I was coming. I started ignoring her and then she called like 3 times. Derek started texting me too and I told him that I didn\u2019t want to go over to Courtney\u2019s for some couples game night and wanted to watch the game. He said it was duo games only so they needed me. I said that I said maybe to begin with so they should find other games. Mollie called me one last time on Derek\u2019s phone. She sounded mad and was like telling me to come. I told her to fuck off and leave me alone. Derek texted me yesterday and said I should apologize to her and her sister. As Courtney was the one without a partner and went and got my specific beers that I liked. I said that it wasn\u2019t my fault, I never gave a yes and never told anyone to get me anything. And his girl should have respected that.

Also, everyone gets all crazy if a guy doesn't accept a woman's \" not interested\". Why is it any different when a man says it? What would she have done if you had shown up with another girl? \nYou don't owe her an apology. No is a complete sentence, and if your roommate gives you any grief, tell him that you are feeling way uncomfortable and he may have to start limiting the times his girlfriend comes over.", "NTA, you did not want to go, you never said you were going, I guess you could have flat out said no since you really did not want to go, not sure if that would have made Mollie happy either.", "NTA.  They're matchmaking.", "NTA.\n\nCourtney is interested in you and instead of putting on her big girl pants and speaking to you, she's playing this teenage 'Do you like me' game with Derek and Mollie as the go betweens.

Now, she and Derek are trying to force something by putting you in close proximity.\n\nI would address this with Derek first: 'Look man, I get you're trying to make Mollie happy by helping her find someone for Courtney, but I am not interested. I've already made that clear to Mollie. So, don't help her try to get me to come along on any other casual hangouts with you guys as a couple or our friendship is going to have problems' and let him be the one to relay that to Mollie.

It sounds like Mollie was trying to play matchmaker for you and Courtney and didn\u2019t like the result. Doing that is always risky, especially if you don\u2019t want to accept it not working.\n\nIt might be a nice gesture to apologize for the swearing. You don\u2019t owe anyone an apology for not being there, but in the future it\u2019s probably safer if you don\u2019t say maybe to their invitations. Just say thank you for the invite but you can\u2019t make it.", "NTA...You did not commit to anything, therefore no apology is needed.

It is okay to decline dating someone for whatever reason. \"It doesn't work for me\" is reason enough. It sounds as if they've taken your reasons to not want to date the sister as \"objections\" to be overcome, the attitude of a salesperson. In such cases, repeating your boundary, \"I am not interested in dating (name)\" without giving reasons or defenses works best. They know your reasons. They don't respect your boundary. They were tricking you into a double date. Your consistency foiled their plan. They were counting on you to go along to be nice while violating your stated boundaries.", "ESH.\n\nYou learned you should give a firm answer, and that is not a big request. Especially if you know people want you there. It is rude and, frankly, immature.\n\nThey should have left you alone once you said no, and just remember that if you had clearly been up front or forth coming with a firm answer this could have been avoided.", "ESH.  Them for trying to force this girl on you when you were clear you weren\u2019t interested, and YOU for saying that silly little \u201cmaybe\u201d to their invitation when you had no intention of going.  Don\u2019t do that.  If you don\u2019t want to go to a party, just say no, be clear.  You opened the door for the harassment with your little \u201cmaybe\u201d.", "ESH.\n\nThis one was tough. Nobody is truly without fault here and nobody is truly terrible. Yeah, it's kind of annoying that Mollie keeps trying to set you up with her sister and isn't taking no for an answer. Yes, you should have probably just said \"no\" up front to Mollie's party. Yes, it was a bit much telling Mollie to \"f off\". Everyone could be better.\n\nHonestly, if you don't apologize to Mollie, I think you'll find that you and your roommate start to have problems. That doesn't mean you have to do more than apologize for being rude on the phone. In my head, it's something like this:\n\n*I'm sorry I told you to \"f off\" over the phone. I really wasn't in the mood to go out that night or get set up for a surprise date with your sister, but you guys weren't taking \"no\" for an answer. I let my anger get the best of me and that was rude. I hope you can understand.*", "While I think you might be on the right side of this argument in general (you didn't commit to go to this party), you are definitely an AH.  It seeps out of just about every comment you make.  Why this girl wants to hang out with you is a mystery.  YTA", "NTA if the roles were reversed you would get done for harassment, ignore them.", "NTA. Mollie is the asshole here. She engineered everything due to her blind faith in her own judgement. And also she tried to manipulate and control you.", "NTA man. this is some weird meet cute that the sister is trying to set up. You are under no obligation to play along with this drama.", "I\u2019m sorry dude. Sometimes saying \u201cnot interested\u201d isn\u2019t enough and harassment follows. NTA, it\u2019s not fair. Now, having said that, don\u2019t be close minded to dating divorced women with kids, they can be awesome", "There was a mention of pregnancy during the divorce. If that pregnancy went to term, OP is absolutely in the clear for knowing that he doesn't want to be a stepfather right now and not getting involved with someone with a kid.\n\nAfter that, Derek, Mollie, and Courtney don't seem to understand boundaries. Which means they aren't friends at all.", "NTA here. It isn't like he's NOT allowed to have preferences. In the past he has clearly communicated that he is NOT interested, end of story.", "I don't think he's an AH for having a preference not to date divorced people. It's his dating life, his call. The second Mollie heard OP doesn't date divorc\u00e9es, she should've wanted better for her sister Courtney. She's making her sister appear desperate by pushing it when from OP's description, it's clear if Courtney keeps doing Courtney, she will find her person and it isn't OP.", "Divorced once I guess is ok. Maybe she was young and stupid, but divorced multiple times and I start asking what's her problem. And then raising another man's kid is an absolute no no for me. OP's right she has baggage.", "> maybe a bit for your attitude about a woman being divorced\n\nMen are allowed to have preferences.  A woman would not catch nearly as much criticism for the same preference.", "Exactly!!! He didn't need to bring up what he said verbatim. Just simply he liked her as a friend. He created an issue for no reason.\n\nThey were trying to set them up and it backfired.", "Agreed - OP seems like an AH in general, but not for the actual topic at hand.", "Men not allowed preferences?", "Yeah. And tbh it's kind AH to be down for \"something casual\" with a divorced woman but nothing more. Like, she's good enough to bang, but not good enough to date. It's a preference I suppose, but it is icky. Best to keep that shit to yourself.", "NTA, agreed but i dont think his tone helped much lol. not much you can do when someone wont quit though xD\n\nmatchmaking after he said he wasnt interested. even if he was kind of open to the idea, they didnt communicate and sprung it on him. surprises are nice, but they made plans *knowing* he was busy, then got mad when he didnt show up and pestered him expecting him to give in then got mad. \n\nshe probably dressed up and everyone was gossiping about their matchmaking. they bought beer, they planned supposed activities.\n\nthey got embarrassed by their own bad planning. if youre going to surprise someone with something, make sure they're coming. if they arent interested, leave them alone.", "Putting him in close proximity and pressuring him to drink.", "Your last line lost me.  He didn't deserve to be harassed.", ">Nobody is truly without fault here and nobody is truly terrible.\n\nI agree on nobody doing anything TRULY terrible but others than OP are at fault lol, they are and were pushy, annoying little pieces of work. He communicated clear no and he was being pushed. A couple's gsme night with OP and Courtney??? After he said no? Too much.\n\nTelling f off wasn't much at all though since they weren't taking a polite no for an answer. As far as I read it right, you say that in your 'apology'. Sure it was rude but no ruder than what they were doing after a NO. This would be super creepy if a man tried to force a woman into this, frankly. NTA.\n\nBut I do agree on the fact that OP and roomie will start to have problems. I would say apologize if peace needs to be kept but communicate that this was rude af.", "He doesn't have to cooperate when they try to forcefully Hook him up with the sister. He already said clearly he's not interested in that. NTA op\n\nWarn Derek and his gf that if they don't cut the crap and try to set you up again with Courtney you won't meet with them. You said no and they need to respect it", "You are making up reasons to be angry.", "Yeah; what does he mean the girlfriend \"comes from a really good family?\" Maybe he just means they're honest, hard-working people, but it comes off a little elitist.", "You are right, he didn\u2019t.  I didn\u2019t word that well at all.  I only meant that when you say \u201cmaybe\u201d to people who are trying to force you to do something, THEY see that as an open invitation to harrass you into capitulation.  It\u2019s best to just shut them down."]}
