Which includes her sister Courtney, who I have met once or twice. \n\nAbout a month ago Derek asked me what I thought about Courtney. I said she was hot and really down to earth and I\u2019ve had good times whenever she goes out with us. Derek said mollie wanted him to ask me that. I said I wasn\u2019t interested in her due to her history. But if she wanted to ever hangout or something casual she could have my number. Derek reported back to mollie and the last few weeks have been awkward. Mollie seems standoffish. I bought her a beer and asked her what was wrong last week. She said she didn\u2019t like what I said about her sister. I said that her sister had been married before, was pregnant and got divorced. It was too much baggage for me. I thought it all was good after we talked. \n\nLast weekend mollie hosted a game night at Courtney\u2019s house. She made a big to do about this game night and kept asking if I was gonna come. I told her maybe. I had other plans that night so I might stop by. I went out for a drink and then decided to stay home and watch a game. At 8pm mollie started texting me asking when I was coming. I started ignoring her and then she called like 3 times. Derek started texting me too and I told him that I didn\u2019t want to go over to Courtney\u2019s for some couples game night and wanted to watch the game. He said it was duo games only so they needed me. I said that I said maybe to begin with so they should find other games. Mollie called me one last time on Derek\u2019s phone. She sounded mad and was like telling me to come. I told her to fuck off and leave me alone. Derek texted me yesterday and said I should apologize to her and her sister.

It is okay to decline dating someone for whatever reason. \"It doesn't work for me\" is reason enough. It sounds as if they've taken your reasons to not want to date the sister as \"objections\" to be overcome, the attitude of a salesperson. In such cases, repeating your boundary, \"I am not interested in dating (name)\" without giving reasons or defenses works best. They know your reasons. They don't respect your boundary. They were tricking you into a double date. Your consistency foiled their plan. They were counting on you to go along to be nice while violating your stated boundaries.", "ESH.\n\nYou learned you should give a firm answer, and that is not a big request.

Nobody is truly without fault here and nobody is truly terrible. Yeah, it's kind of annoying that Mollie keeps trying to set you up with her sister and isn't taking no for an answer. Yes, you should have probably just said \"no\" up front to Mollie's party. Yes, it was a bit much telling Mollie to \"f off\". Everyone could be better.\n\nHonestly, if you don't apologize to Mollie, I think you'll find that you and your roommate start to have problems. That doesn't mean you have to do more than apologize for being rude on the phone. In my head, it's something like this:\n\n*I'm sorry I told you to \"f off\" over the phone. I really wasn't in the mood to go out that night or get set up for a surprise date with your sister, but you guys weren't taking \"no\" for an answer.

In the past he has clearly communicated that he is NOT interested, end of story.", "I don't think he's an AH for having a preference not to date divorced people. It's his dating life, his call. The second Mollie heard OP doesn't date divorc\u00e9es, she should've wanted better for her sister Courtney. She's making her sister appear desperate by pushing it when from OP's description, it's clear if Courtney keeps doing Courtney, she will find her person and it isn't OP.", "Divorced once I guess is ok.

And tbh it's kind of AH to be down for \"something casual\" with a divorced woman but nothing more. Like, she's good enough to bang, but not good enough to date.

Too much.\n\nTelling f off wasn't much at all though since they weren't taking a polite no for an answer. As far as I read it right, you say that in your 'apology'. Sure it was rude but no ruder than what they were doing after a NO. This would be super creepy if a man tried to force a woman into this, frankly.

Not force it which is what is happening here.", "NTA. She's not taking no for an answer because she IS setting you up with her sister whether you like it or not.  Your buddy kinda screwed you a little telling his girlfriend word for word what you said. No biggie. Guys do that to each other without realizing.", "NTA and you should circle back to them and tell your friends that you're not interested in Courtney.

They suck.", "NTA IF we\u2019re being quite frank, this is harassment plain and simple.", "NTA. Mollie is trying to force you into a relationship with her PREGNANT sister? She's got a lot of control issues, but none of them are your responsibility. Courtney is just caught in the middle and that is unfortunate.

Say no, that way your evening can always open up if you want to hang out. \n\nUnfortunately by creating a grey area with the words you might stop by. It just screws you over. Don't do this again, especially now that you know they have an agenda. \n\nYou need to tell him that you're angry and upset that they knew you had plans and you said you might drop by if things end early. What they did was unexcusable, and ask how he'd feel if you started blowing up their phone when they were out because you wanted them to be home. \n\nTell them this is made worse by the fact that they then tried to guilt you using Courtney. Which leads you to believe they didn't want you there to hang out but because they're trying to push you to pursue Courtney for a FWBs situation. \n\nThen tell them Courtney is an adult, if she's happy having casual sex she can contact you and tell you that.\n\nIt sounds like if you plan on being friends with roommate, you're going to have to start disappearing on \"dates\". Because they don't understand boundaries.", "NTAH< Mollie sounds like she is 15 not 26. I bet she is telling your buddy that it would be amazing if you dated her sister and then you all could double date and all that fun stuff.

In no way are you in the wrong for having expectations for a potential partners, but your friend was kind of an AH for letting details slip to his gf. He could\u2019ve simply said you weren\u2019t interested. They\u2019re also AH\u2019s for being annoying and pushy for you to come spend time with them. They don\u2019t respect your boundaries. Period.", "NTA\n\nNo is a complete answer and sentence. They should have listened to you before when you said you weren't interested. If Courtney got hurt and is upset, it's either her own fault for not listening to you, or her sisters fault for making it seem like you were interested.", "I am going with ESH. \n\nI feel like you're kind of a lead-on, based on what you've said. \n\nAbout Courtney: \"I said she was hot and really down to earth and I\u2019ve had good times whenever she goes out with us. I said I wasn\u2019t interested in her due to her history.  If she wanted to ever hangout or something casual she could have my number.\" AKA, you would have fun but nothing past that.

Say yes or no.\n\nThey should have caught on by now about how free-spirited and noncommittal you are, and shouldn't have harrassed you about not being there.

So you say not interested. Molly demands to know why, you explain, and then she tries a secret setup? Because that's going to work?
