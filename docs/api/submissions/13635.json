We are in agreement about this situation but others in the wedding party think we are assholes.\n\nContext: Groom has 3 siblings that are all female. The oldest sister (OS) is married to an asshole and they are always on the verge of splitting up but have stayed together so far because they have 2 kids.\n\nWe sent out wedding invites early (6 months out) as many of our guests need to make travel arrangements to attend (OS does not). We sent an invite to OS and her family addressed 'The Last Name Family' to make it clear that OS, her husband, and kids were all invited.\n\nThe issue: OS and her husband have since separated and she now has a new boyfriend. She has assumed that she still has a plus one to invite her new boy friend. We don't want him there as we have never met him, the whole situation makes us uncomfortable, and it doesn't fit any of our decided criteria for a +1 (married, engaged, been dating 1+ year or bride/groom has met them). Not only have we not met him but Grooms/OS parents haven't met him. Grooms other sisters just met him yesterday. It sounds like OS and her kids are planning on moving in with new boyfriend.\n\nWe asked younger sister (best woman) to let OS know that new boy friend is not invited. She thought it was rude of us to say and it's like we are taking away her +1. To us we didn't invite SO +3, we invited the family. Now that family has one less person in it. Are we the assholes?\n\nEdit: The reason we have not talked to OS about this is because she has not told us she has a boyfriend. We only found out through the grapevine. She also hasn't answer any of Grooms calls for the past 2 weeks.", "created_utc": 1680267475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127kof9/aita_for_telling_my_future_sil_she_cant_bring_a/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is perfectly appropriate to say that you are only doing +1s for serious long term relationships.  \n\n\nAlso, in case anyone else is thinking about sending invites 6 months out, don't! You send \"save the date\" at that time. Invites go out 4-6 weeks before, by which time all the important people know the date already.", "NTA.\n\nIts your wedding, you get to decide who's on the guestlist and who gets a plus one.

It\u2019s not like he\u2019ll be in pictures, so as long as it\u2019s not a budget issue, I\u2019d keep the peace and let her bring him. Plus since there\u2019s a chance this new bf could be a long term relationship, this is an opportunity to make him feel welcomed instead of excluded. \n\nThere\u2019s a number of people who were at my wedding 10+ years ago that I am no longer friends with, and a couple family members we don\u2019t speak to any longer. It has no bearing on our marriage or lives.", "You can invite who you want but YTA for trying to dump the task of telling her on someone else.", "YTA. Enjoy your special day and stop making it more than what it is. If you were financially prepared for her and her husband then her bringing a date is no issue.

Don\u2019t start your marriage alienating people.", "YTA - if you're going to strongly enforce this, then it's inappropriate to send the younger sister to do your dirty work instead of telling her yourself and explaining the criteria you've selected. \n\nThis also might be unpopular but I do think family is exempt from some of the +1 criteria. Who's to say the family won't meet him before the wedding, anyways? She's part of the wedding and that's a big ask from anyone, so I'd throw her a bone and let her bring her boyfriend. It feels like you're staking this all on a moral absolute instead of considering what this decision could do to your relationship. What would you prefer? The BF to come to the wedding, or the sister to be bitter and pissed the whole time and potentially hold a lasting grudge about this? I'd personally pick the boyfriend.", "Your wedding, your rules, but yes, YTA. \n\nUnless you have reason to believe that the new boyfriend will disrupt your wedding, you're simply being a moral turd in the punchbowl and creating a rift in the family because you don't approve of SIL moving on. \n\nBy all means, you do you, but don't be surprised if this blows up in your face for years to come.", "YTA.\n\nI'm old school.

It's reasonable of her to assume that she can bring someone else if she thinks it's only a budget question.\n\nYou need to talk to her personally (not via the sister), not make the comments about her bf being new (cause they sound judgmental), and to clearly explain the rule.", "NAH, but don't you think it may have been better to tell her yourself?", "NTA", "Your SIL didn\u2019t have a plus one. The family unit was invited. The husband was on the invitation. She had no intention of telling you about this boyfriend, and by the sounds of it, actively avoided any discussion by ignoring attempted contact.

If she is making zero efforts into helping for him to become welcome in this scenario, then of course he shouldn\u2019t be invited. He was never invited.

You \"took away\" her plus one through the grapevine without even talking to her about it. You should be happy OS dumped her husband and found happiness.\n\nDoes it really matter if she brings this guy? You had already planned to pay for her ex's spot. If she was with her ex for many years, she may feel uncomfortable going to such an event alone, or feel like a failure that her marriage ended. If bringing the new boyfriend, who it sounds like she's in a serious relationship with, makes the SISTER of your fiance more comfortable, why wouldn't you let him attend?\n\nYou played this totally wrong and have likely undermined your relationship with a woman who will be a part of your immediate family. You have also alienated your future family by making yourself look selfish and unsupportive.\n\nUnless you meet the BF and he seems like he would be a disruptive psycho at your wedding, there is no reason to not allow him to attend. On your wedding day you will have minimal interaction with him and it would make your future SIL very happy. It's not really a big deal. Stop being a bridezilla.", "I'll go with YTA.  You're not out extra money since you were planning on the plus one and it sounds like this person is part of her family now if they are moving in with him.   Weddings are often social events where people bring dates (hence the 500 movies about people finding dates for weddings).  Let this one go and enjoy your special day.", "YTA. You\u2019d already counted her ex as a +1, it won\u2019t hurt anything to invite new guy. Unless there was some actual reason for thinking he would cause a scene or be disruptive then you\u2019re just being petty. Plus if he does cause some sort of problem, just kick him out? The whole issue is going to cause a lot of unnecessary drama and it\u2019s not a good look for you, the new person in the family, to be bringing it. It could cause a huge rift down the line.

He could also be a perfect gentleman but it is understandable to not want to take that risk.\n\nAlso since no one in the family has met him other than 1 sister, him attending the wedding would likely take attention away from the couple, due to family members wanting to meet & greet him.\n\nLastly, as expensive as weddings are, most couples want to be surrounded by people who know them & dont want to pay $75 a plate for people theyve never met", "1 sister is married and the other is engaged.

Plus SIL is considering moving in with him. This might be one of these relationships that became serious quickly.", "I disagree with the idea that you have to know everyone at your wedding, although like I said I'm old school about this. I was raised at a time when it was a given that everyone you invited to your wedding would have a guest. Because yes it's your day, but you are responsible for your guests. And no one wants to go to an event alone.\n\nAs far as him being obnoxious etc- you have no control over how the guests at your wedding (or anywhere else) behave, whether they're blood relatives you've known your entire life or your boss's wife who you have to invite because if you don't you'll be fired. And if the sister ends up marrying the guy, is that going to make him any more or less obnoxious? Nope. But if he's excluded and they get married, they're never going to forget that he was excluded from the wedding. Not saying they need to include him in family pictures, but not allowing him to be there at all could come back to haunt them.\n\nLastly- I'm also old school about wedding costs. If my meal cost $75, I'm going to make sure the check I write the B&G is $100.\n\nedit: I thought about this more and realized I needed to add to my comment. One of the reasons this bothers me so much is the whole attitude of \"It's my day, my dollar, it's all about me, and IDGAF about anyone else.\"  If you DGAF about anyone else on your wedding day, do you GAF about them any other day? And do they GAF about you? Why should they, if you don't care about them? This is why society is collapsing. Why the suicide rate among Gen Z is astronomical. Why families are falling apart and why everyone is miserable. Because no one is willing to take others into consideration anymore. It's all about what I want, and fuck everyone else.", "If meeting you and your fianc\u00e9 is a part of your criteria for a plus one, why don\u2019t you ask your SIL to introduce you to her bf? I understand that you live in different states but why not set up a virtual meeting via FaceTime or Zoom? Your SIL has already started to introduce him to some family members so I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t have a problem introducing him to you and your fianc\u00e9 .", "In that case, you should talk directly with your future SIL and hear how serious of a relationship it\u2019s becoming. Moving in together is a huge step so he could be your future BIL sooner rather than later. If they decided to marry, you might find yourself in an awkward situation where they find an excuse not to invite you. You are marrying her brother, which means into *her* immediate family. The resolution to this current situation could have some long term repercussions that aren\u2019t obvious now. Just something to think about when you envision what holidays and other special events might be like for you and your soon-to-be husband.", "Yes, of course that would change the whole post but from what we are told SIL didn't even tell them that she is dating someone new....  \nAnd at least in my eyes many \"super serious\" relationships that start really fast after leaving their ex partner are rarely healthy but I might be biased from my own experience.", "NTA for not wanting a stranger at your wedding.

It isn't fair to put younger sister in that position.\n\nThe edit implies that OP and her groom didn't know that his older sister even had a boyfriend let alone was bringing him to the wedding until younger sister told them. In that context it makes sense to respond with \"tell her that's not gonna happen\" especially since older sister isn't answering their calls.", "The OP has added an edit since you replied. Apparently the older sister hasn\u2019t been answering any calls from her brother (the groom) so I can see why they asked the younger sister to tell the older sister.", "Actually, it\u2019s perfectly fair to not want a stranger at your wedding. They will be in your photos/videos and since they have not been together for very long the probability of them lasting is not very good.", "Ah okay thanks, I commented pre-edit. I have a bit more sympathy on that part in that case (and still maintain the NTA for your wedding, your choice on invites). It's a bit \"he said she said\" but I can understand how the situation has panned out this way for sure.", "It doesn't matter whether the couple lasts.  Hell, the bride and groom probably won't make it, come to that. The point is that a focus on ridiculous rules and control is a bad way to join a family.", "I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t agree with you. I have people in my wedding pictures that I really don\u2019t like and I didn\u2019t want them at our wedding. They were not together long enough with no serious commitment; but to honor the peace, we said they\u2019re welcome. I regret that decision. \n\nWhen you are paying for other people to celebrate, and let\u2019s be real - weddings are expensive, I do not see a reason why you need to pay for someone to be at your wedding that you do not have any kind of friendship or relationship with and that will be in your memories for however long.\n\nETA: my husband regrets our decision to honor the peace and let the extra people come even more than I do.", "I see your point but there could be a lot of reasons why OP\u2019s SIL hasn\u2019t said anything about her new relationship yet. For example, maybe she\u2019s nervous to share that she\u2019s dating again and she finds it hard easier to tell people one at a time.\n\nAs for the relationship itself, OP and her fianc\u00e9 were going to let her SIL\u2019s ex husband come to the wedding even though he\u2019s an AH and their marriage was practically over. I don\u2019t see the difference between the SIL bringing her partner in a failed marriage and bringing her partner is a dating relationship that may not work out."]}
