We are in agreement about this situation but others in the wedding party think we are assholes.\n\nContext: Groom has 3 siblings that are all female. The oldest sister (OS) is married to an asshole and they are always on the verge of splitting up but have stayed together so far because they have 2 kids.\n\nWe sent out wedding invites early (6 months out) as many of our guests need to make travel arrangements to attend (OS does not). We sent an invite to OS and her family addressed 'The Last Name Family' to make it clear that OS, her husband, and kids were all invited.\n\nThe issue: OS and her husband have since separated and she now has a new boyfriend. She has assumed that she still has a plus one to invite her new boy friend. We don't want him there as we have never met him, the whole situation makes us uncomfortable, and it doesn't fit any of our decided criteria for a +1 (married, engaged, been dating 1+ year or bride/groom has met them). Not only have we not met him but Grooms/OS parents haven't met him. Grooms other sisters just met him yesterday. It sounds like OS and her kids are planning on moving in with new boyfriend.\n\nWe asked younger sister (best woman) to let OS know that new boy friend is not invited. She thought it was rude of us to say and it's like we are taking away her +1. To us we didn't invite SO +3, we invited the family. Now that family has one less person in it. Are we the assholes?\n\nEdit: The reason we have not talked to OS about this is because she has not told us she has a boyfriend. We only found out through the grapevine.

I was raised at a time when it was a given that everyone you invited to your wedding would have a guest. Because yes it's your day, but you are responsible for your guests. And no one wants to go to an event alone.\n\nAs far as him being obnoxious etc- you have no control over how the guests at your wedding (or anywhere else) behave, whether they're blood relatives you've known your entire life or your boss's wife who you have to invite because if you don't you'll be fired. And if the sister ends up marrying the guy, is that going to make him any more or less obnoxious? Nope. But if he's excluded and they get married, they're never going to forget that he was excluded from the wedding. Not saying they need to include him in family pictures, but not allowing him to be there at all could come back to haunt them.\n\nLastly- I'm also old school about wedding costs. If my meal cost $75, I'm going to make sure the check I write the B&G is $100.\n\nedit: I thought about this more and realized I needed to add to my comment. One of the reasons this bothers me so much is the whole attitude of \"It's my day, my dollar, it's all about me, and IDGAF about anyone else.\"  If you DGAF about anyone else on your wedding day, do you GAF about them any other day? And do they GAF about you? Why should they, if you don't care about them? This is why society is collapsing. Why the suicide rate among Gen Z is astronomical. Why families are falling apart and why everyone is miserable. Because no one is willing to take others into consideration anymore. It's all about what I want, and fuck everyone else.", "If meeting you and your fianc\u00e9 is a part of your criteria for a plus one, why don\u2019t you ask your SIL to introduce you to her bf?

It's pretty tacky to pick and choose imo.", "NTA", "NTA - it's the bride and grooms day... not \"meet sisters new squeeze\" day.", "Nta, why would a stranger be entitled to one of the most memorable days of your life? She\u2019ll get over it if she can think about someone else for five seconds- I\u2019d imagine the kids aren\u2019t keen on this idea either", "NTA", "I'm floored by how many posts are about wedding drama on AITA.  Why do people get so shitty to each other because of these events? What's up with the entitlement, rudeness and selfishness? Even my own family has had drama/conflict during and around the planning of weddings, and I stayed far away from it. What is it about these fancy parties that make people act like such assholes?", "Lots of resources say that it\u2019s perfectly fine to send invites out 6 months ahead, especially if people are traveling. When travel plans need to be made, save the dates go out 10-12 months in advance.", "Read the edit. Sister is not answering her phone from the groom.", " \n\nWe were more concerned about our guests having a good time than meeting a few people for the first time.", "Exactly why are people causing drama before there is any drama?", "Hindsight is a beautiful thing. You did what you thought was best and that\u2019s ok so don\u2019t beat yourself up about it!", "Most readers must have overlooked the part that they are NoT returning the grooms calls, what other choice does he have since he\u2019s not even suppose to know about the new boy.", "> Also since no one in the family has met him other than 1 sister, him attending the wedding would likely take attention away from the couple..\n\nThis is without a doubt the most ridiculous reason I've heard yet.  Should people just not do anything at a wedding, because it could possibly take away attention from the couple getting married?  You'd have to be incredibly insecure with your relationship to everyone invited for this to actually be a problem.  \n\nWeddings are for celebration and typically include dancing.  Having a plus one means you have someone to dance with, to talk to when everyone else you know is busy, someone to run interference for people you don't want to talk to, and help with the kids for parents.  Giving plus ones used to be standard, when people gave a sh*t about their guests.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou invited OS and her husband -- you didn't give her an unnamed plus one.  Wedding invitations are not concert tickets, you can't just transfer them to another person.\n\nIf the invite says \"John and Maria Smith\" those are the 2 people invited.  If it says \"The Bradshaw Family\" then Mr. and Mrs. Bradshaw and their kids are invited.  The boyfriend's name was nowhere on that envelope.  He is not invited.\n\nHowever, if OS is not taking your calls, you should email or text her, not ask younger sister to relay the message.", ">unless they are paying for said +1.\n\nIsn't this what happens? I'm confused. I mean, I'm 48, so I've been to my fair share of weddings, and I always wrote a check for the cost of all the meals I rsvp'd for (meaning sometimes for me, my husband and our kids, or sometimes just myself and my bf/husband depending on how long ago we're talking about) plus some extra because that's the right thing to do. But I'm 48, so I'm well past the age where I have tons of people in my life getting married. I've only been to three weddings in the last five years. Is that no longer what people do?", "I was a wedding photographer for 25 years. A few years ago (pre-Covid) I made a conscious decision to stop doing weddings for this exact reason. The vast majority of the brides we were dealing with were so self-centered, demanding, just totally \"This is MY DAY and you'll all do what I say!\" And they were all miserable. The amount of pressure they put on themselves to make everything EXACTLY RIGHT left them unable to enjoy their own day. The last wedding I did, the bride had a meltdown because there were take home boxes for cake and they were supposed to be square but they were rectangular. She spent the last hour of her reception crying in the coat closet. \n\nI seriously miss the days when it was about the marriage, not the wedding.", "1 look at the edit 2 the difference is her not even knowing him??", "\"Look how quirky and traditional I am!\"\n\nAre you also \"old school\" about brides wearing non-white dresses? What about the type of music they play? Child-free weddings?\n\nWeird argument.", "Look at the edit", "Wait you went to weddings you had to pay for the meals?!?\n\nIn my country the bride and groom pay for everyone\u2019s food that\u2019s why I said asking for +1(and insisting on it) is rude, because you are just forcing someone to pay for your +1 meal and it\u2019s an expensive as hell meal.\n\nI\u2019ve never been to a wedding where people pay for their meals, usually I try to gift something of similar value to what I believe they paid for in my meal so it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d, but here we pay like 400-500 per meal and most of our gifts were 200 per couple/sometimes group.\n\nSo weddings tend to be just\u2026 expensive XD", "I'm all for child-free weddings. Adults deserve adult time, and if you've got your kids at a wedding you're not enjoying the wedding, you're watching your kids. Although I also don't care if you have kids at your wedding, if that's the vibe you're going for.\n\nWhy would I care what color the bride's dress is? I'm not the one wearing it. \n\nNot sure what your point about music is.\n\nAs far as me being \"quirky and traditional\".... ok. Traditional in the sense that I was raised with a set of values that I recognize are no longer followed (hence the recognition \"I'm old school\"). Quirky? If you say so.", "It wasn't really overlooking, they just commented before the edit was made", "Sorry, I guess I should have explained that better. We don't \"pay for our meals\" in the US either. But we generally give a gift of money that is more than what the B&G spent on our meals. And that would be everyone I RSVP'd for. So say the meals were $150/plate. If it was just me and my husband, I'd write a check for at least $350. If it was my, my husband and our two kids, I'd write a check for $750ish. So if you're invited to that wedding and not allowed to bring a +1, your gift would be $175. If you're a person and a +1, you should be giving the B&G $350.", "\"Join a family\" LMFAOOO.\n\nA wedding is not about the family. Go back to whatever century you came from.", "Ah, got it.\n\nYes, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the same exactly (thought definitely that is better than the what happened at my wedding), but I guess it depends on the kind of wedding you are having.\n\nIf it is a big place and people don\u2019t have their seats assigned beforehand, nor had to cut other people whom they\u2019ve known from the guest list (again, considering they don\u2019t know your +1 or something similar to that) then I guess it\u2019s not such an issue if you are giving a gift of similar value.\n\nBut if it is a mini wedding (less than 50 people) I\u2019d feel bad for asking for a +1 for a person the bride and groom don\u2019t even know (even if I gifted something of similar value) considering that they probably couldn\u2019t fit everyone they likes in their guest list in the first place.\n\nBut, yes, gifting something of similar value makes it way better.", "NTA - your wedding your rules.", "Nta", "NTA. Send a text and email and whatever other types of social media she has like Instagram or Snapchat or Facebook Messenger. Literally any social media so she can\u2019t claim she hasn\u2019t seen it yet or send a new invite and specifically state new boyfriend not allowed!", "Agreed.  People have the weirdest ideas about weddings and wanting to have control over who someone\u2019s +1 is allowed to be. Lots of pearl-clutching about \u201cWe don\u2019t know this person! He could be a criminal!\u201d  How about trusting the OS to bring a decent person, dropping the bridezilla attitude, and enjoying your wedding instead of causing unnecessary drama?", "If sister is not answering her phone from the groom does sister not have social media? Text messaging? Email? If they're already going to make things awkward by starting this drama and not letting her have a plus one then they may as well follow it through and tell her to her face or virtually and not dump it on the younger sister to do. That's trashy", "You keep saying you're \"old school\", but I think this is more a matter of you living in a cultural bubble that is separate from OP's cultural bubble. Wedding traditions and etiquette are not the same everywhere. \n\nFor instance, you say that you're all for child-free weddings, but that doesn't seem very \"old school\" to me; in fact, it seems like a very modern concept. There are many people who would be aghast at excluding children (particularly those who are family) from a wedding celebration.\n\nWhere I am, plus-ones are not unheard of, but they're certainly a rarity, rather than a given. Typically, couples in long-term relationships are invited to weddings together, but no one expects a brand-new partner to receive an invitation."]}
