A nice person doesn't guilt trip. A nice person doesn't try to intrude. A nice person doesn't try to lure you out of the flat. A nice person doesn't even claim to be a nice person.

You mentioned \u00a3 several times - and getting someone to go to the bank to take money out for a complete stranger is a known scam here in the UK. Chances of you being abducted from a UK town centre is extremely low - but the chances of being forced to hand over more money is way way higher. \n\nMy advice to anyone who finds themselves in this situation - smile and say you're just going to let your husband/other adult male resident know where you're going.

Nothing about his story makes sense.  If the alarm is going off in your place of business, the police will automatically go out there.

That sounds like a straight up junkie stunt to me. It's always 20 cause that's how much a bag costs. He was dope sick and desperate. Who knows what he might have tried to do to you. Yeah he might've just taken the 20 and left but it does sound like he was trying to put you in a situation where he could get more if he wanted. And if you said yes this time it would never end.

They were visiting from out of town, on their way to a friend's house - but they got lost, the phone was left back at the hotel room, no money, car broke down, my word, what a day.  (On their way to visit a friend in a strange town but didn't bring cash, card, or phone?)  We gave him like three bucks knowing this \"loan\" meant he'd get lost and leave us alone;  it was a really good investment.      \n\n\nGuys like that prey on your good nature.
