I didn't know him so assumed he was new to the building\n\nHe starts a crazy story about how his business was broken into, the alarm\u2019s going off, he needs to get there, he has no cards because someone took his car with his wallet in, he needs taxi fare, he has \u00a310 & only needs \u00a320 to get there & will I be a good neighbour & give him the cash?\n\nI've run into situations like this before when someone on the street says they need money. I've always dealt with it by politely saying 'sorry mate, can't help' & walking off. I've never felt anxious or cornered, even as a woman out alone.\n\nBut this time it happened in my safe space & I immediately felt defensive. He's a stranger, I'm home alone & he could block my door from closing if he wanted. I thought it was a scam but even though I didn\u2019t know him he could still be a neighbour I didn\u2019t want to make him angry & run into him later\n\nHe talked fast, repeated everything & didn't give me a chance to think. He tried to get me to leave the flat & go to the cash point with him. I kept saying no & he started guilt-tripping me\n\nI said he should find someone he knows for help but he said I\u2019m the only one around so I NEED to come with him or give him cash. He then tried to give me some keys & said I could go to is flat & take what I want if I just give him the money.\n\nI can\u2019t close the door while he\u2019s standing so close so I lie & say I\u2019ll give him \u00a320 if he lets me go write something up for him to sign as evidence. He agrees & tries to come in but I say I\u2019ll be right back\n\nI manage to close & lock the door but I\u2019m panicking, my hearts racing & I keep thinking 'what if he does live here?'. But I didn\u2019t want to give him \u00a320 so I say through the door \u2018I don't know you, I don't want to lend you money, please leave'\n\nHe FREAKS OUT says I'm horrible & he's a nice guy then leaves\n\nI asked the letting agent if he\u2019s a tenant but I haven\u2019t heard back. I'm still on edge & scared he\u2019ll come back\n\nMy husband thinks I did right but a friend said he was probably in a tough situation & it wouldn't have killed me to be neighbourly & I'm TA for not helping him get to his business after a break-in\n\nI thought he was scamming me, is there a chance he was just in a tough situation?", "created_utc": 1668520970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvy4eu/aita_for_not_helping_a_neighbour_when_he_came_to/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Annoyed, upset, frustrated, sure. Angry, no.\n\nIn my opinion, you were not in a safe situation, and you did what you had to to be safe. You did nothing wrong.

Tell him if he ever approaches you again, you will call the police.\n\nHe could be the nicest guy in the world, and you still did nothing wrong.

The order is: you first get to know your neighbours, by introducing yourself when you move in. And only after that, after you've lived there for a while, you get to borrow a cup of sugar every now and again.", "Your friend thinks being neighborly is get l giving strangers trying to scam you money? And instead of thinking your friend is insane, you are now unsure if you should have let yourself be scammed?", "You are SO NTA. You did the right thing. Always trust your instincts. Reading this set off so many alarm bells in my head - please disregard what your friend has said and stay attentive of your surroundings.", "NTA\n\nYou're never the asshole for putting your own safety first. If he was saying the truth that sucks. But what is he wasn't? What if he was trying to break in or harm you? Better safe than sorry!", "NTA\n\nEven if he wasn\u2019t trying to scam you (and it sure sounds like he was!), you\u2019re not obligated to lend someone money just because they ask for it. Especially a complete stranger. \n\nBut, for real, everything you described him doing - the sob story, the urgency, \u201cyou\u2019re the only one who can help\u201d, crowding your personal space - all sounds like the con artist playbook to me.", "\"It wouldn't kill you to be neighborly.\"\n\nIt has literally killed thousands of people, thinking they were being neighborly.

I am someone who routinely does give money to homeless people on the street, knowing that sometimes I am being scammed, and sometimes the money will be used for something that will make the person\u2019s situation worse, but always remembering that if I help even one person with a few dollars, it is worth it.  HOWEVER, in your situation I would have done the same thing you did.  He was invading your private space, you weren\u2019t in a public space with others around, he was aggressive, you had no way of knowing if he was your neighbor and his story sounded incredibly far fetched.  You did the right thing.", "NTA...If he comes back, it's time to call the police.", "NTA\n\nhe was likely scamming you.\n\nyou did the right thing.

That was classic social engineering by that stranger. Trying to make his emergency your emergency so you will just ACT instead of THINK. \n\nGreat job keeping your wits and putting your safety/comfort level first. A call to the police would've handled both his alarm issue and getting to the scene. It all sounded like harried bull because that's exactly what it was.

Who knows what would have happened if you let him in or pulled your wallet out?\n\nBusinesses do get broken into. Cars do get stolen.  But to have all of these things happen at the same time is highly unlikely. 99.9 % sure it was a scam.  Trust your gut.", "NTA. I would have done whatever I could to get the door closed also.  You have no idea who this person is,  what he is really after?  Is his real goal to get inside your front door?", "NTA.  That he asked you to go with him to an ATM was unreasonable and dangerous.  I'm glad you were able to close the door on him.  It is NOT neighborly to invade your personal space the way he was.", "NTA NTA NTA. It doesn't matter if his intentions were genuine or not. You felt threatened and you did what was right for you.", "NTA.  The situation does not sound safe.", "NTA, this is clearly a scam.", "NTA and report him. He was scamming you.

Mine is literally full of curtain twitchers who don't miss a beat so would've been posted on there straight away.

You get barely any information as a landlord!", "NTA. This is a huge red flag.\n\nIf it was so urgent to get to his business, surely he could have called an Uber or Lyft to take him because they don't take cash and he could have put it on his card.", "NTA - Helping people in need is great, but you don't need to sacrifice your safety (or even sense of safety) to do so. In this type of situation it is always best to trust your gut.", "NTA \n\nThank goodness you were able to keep him outside of your apartment.", "NTA Tell your friend to go give the guy money if they think he needs it.
