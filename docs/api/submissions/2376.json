I didn't know him so assumed he was new to the building\n\nHe starts a crazy story about how his business was broken into, the alarm\u2019s going off, he needs to get there, he has no cards because someone took his car with his wallet in, he needs taxi fare, he has \u00a310 & only needs \u00a320 to get there & will I be a good neighbour & give him the cash?\n\nI've run into situations like this before when someone on the street says they need money. I've always dealt with it by politely saying 'sorry mate, can't help' & walking off. I've never felt anxious or cornered, even as a woman out alone.\n\nBut this time it happened in my safe space & I immediately felt defensive. He's a stranger, I'm home alone & he could block my door from closing if he wanted. I thought it was a scam but even though I didn\u2019t know him he could still be a neighbour I didn\u2019t want to make him angry & run into him later\n\nHe talked fast, repeated everything & didn't give me a chance to think. He tried to get me to leave the flat & go to the cash point with him. I kept saying no & he started guilt-tripping me\n\nI said he should find someone he knows for help but he said I\u2019m the only one around so I NEED to come with him or give him cash. He then tried to give me some keys & said I could go to is flat & take what I want if I just give him the money.\n\nI can\u2019t close the door while he\u2019s standing so close so I lie & say I\u2019ll give him \u00a320 if he lets me go write something up for him to sign as evidence. He agrees & tries to come in but I say I\u2019ll be right back\n\nI manage to close & lock the door but I\u2019m panicking, my hearts racing & I keep thinking 'what if he does live here?'. But I didn\u2019t want to give him \u00a320 so I say through the door \u2018I don't know you, I don't want to lend you money, please leave'\n\nHe FREAKS OUT says I'm horrible & he's a nice guy then leaves\n\nI asked the letting agent if he\u2019s a tenant but I haven\u2019t heard back. I'm still on edge & scared he\u2019ll come back\n\nMy husband thinks I did right but a friend said he was probably in a tough situation & it wouldn't have killed me to be neighbourly & I'm TA for not helping him get to his business after a break-in\n\nI thought he was scamming me, is there a chance he was just in a tough situation?\n\n  \n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all the comments & messages!
