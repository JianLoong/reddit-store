My mom and I buy my niece snacks for school in bulk to last the month with foodstamps. My nephew is significantly more well-off than we are and is EXTREMELY frugal.\n\nBecause of my  moms open door policy regarding family members and food he will come to our house MULTIPLE times a day for food and drinks. He'll invite himself over for meals and eat more than his share as well as take home plates for leftovers leaving us with no leftovers ourselves.\n\nBut I draw the line at my neices snacks because they serve a purpose and we need them to last.

He is over  taking her snacks, so much so that sometimes he'll even eat all of a particular snack before she's even had a chance to have any.\n\nWe've asked him multiple times to stop, she herself has even asked him to stop and in response, he'll call her greedy and spoiled. That she's not eating them so why can he have some.

Mom didnt say anything about it so she came to me and I called him out for taking the last brownie. \n\nHe got pissed and said she's spoiled, greedy, not the only grandkid, and he can eat here if he wants to. Then threw the brownie in the trash and stormed off. \n\nSo was I the asshole?  \n\nThere is alot more to the situation but due to the character limit I can go into more detail about everything that happened before this.\n\nEDIT: my nephew sent me this text a minute ago: \n\"I just got y'all snacks a few days ago. It's not like I'm coming over every day and eating all of y'all's food. You need to teach Jenna to share with people instead of being that fucking stingy about some snacks. \n\nIts terrible behavior for Jenna to act like that and do that fake cry about a snack she wasn't even eating. If your that tight on money that you want to come screaming at me over a 50\u00a2 snack cake then y'all need to really get your finances in order.  \n\nThere's plenty of food in there so y'all can't be starving that bad.  It was WRONG what you and Jenna did to me. I already know you won't care but I won't offer y'all snacks anymore and I won't eat y'all's food. It was honestly ridiculous you even did that to me over a snack cake. \n\nY'all get food stamps and shit I don't. It's also wrong that you encourage her with that type of behavior too. \"", "created_utc": 1698200563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fublo/aita_for_asking_my_nephew_m27_stop_eating_my/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he were a decent person he would buy Jenna some treats every now and then because being on food stamps is no fun.\n\nI don't know if you get your mom to see that your nephew is a bully but Jenna's snacks need to put under lock and \u0199ey. She has a right to not worry about her snacks for school.   And you need to tell off your nephew every time he pulls some sh*t with Jenna. It's bad enough your mom is like wet blanket when it comes to him but that little girl needs at least one adult in her corner.", "Legally, if he's not on the SNAP case, he's STEALING FEDERAL FUNDS FROM A CHILD.\n\nYou're NTA. \n\nTHE LATE STAGE ADOLESCENT AT 27 is the asshole, and so are his enabling family members.", "NTA\nThis dude is a nightmare. You have a mom problem. If your family gets food stamps, you already don't have enough food for yourselves. Feeding anyone who stops in is going to short you. Especially someone who comes over for multiple meals and ransacks your house eating everything in sight.\n\nThe trouble is, it's your mom's house. She has to be the one who learns to say no. If she won't do it, the only thing you can do is hide the snacks in your bedroom.", "The fact that the poor child has taken to hiding her own snacks at 7 years old is hinting at a potential long-term impact to her relationship with food because of this monster. Food scarcity in childhood can have some real lasting effects. She's already got some unfair challenges to overcome if she had to be placed with you all away from her mom to begin with, that she has special needs requiring specialized education, and then there's aggressive bullying from a male adult that she is being taught is acceptable when her guardians stand by and witness the abuse in front of them and don't stop it. \n\nNTA, why are the feelings of greedy adult bully more important to your mother than protecting that child's well-being? Doesn't she have the slightest urge to protect that child? If she starts exhibiting a bad relationship to food at school, they're going to start asking some questions and they would be fully within their rights and obligations to do so as mandatory reporters.", "N.T.A.. this post actually got me boiling.. 27yrold adult picking on a 7yrold kid and taking her food when the family is on a budget. HELL  NO... if anyone is spoiled, it's him.. The dude needs to have his privilege checked..you do not pull this kind of crap on family and pretend you smell like roses afterward.", "NTA. \n\nBut I can\u2019t believe you guys let him take not just the snacks but all of the other stuff when your own foodstamps. He has money he can buy his own damn food, stop letting him get away with it.", "> Because of my moms open door policy regarding family members and food\n\nI don\u2019t understand writing an entire post when the issue is right here and easily fixable. \n\nYour mom needs to stop letting family come into the home and do whatever they want. If she\u2019s not going to do that then get a mini fridge or small lockable cabinet and keep your nieces stuff in your room or her room or a basement etc.", "NTA. Change the locks, and use them.", "NTA. Food stamps are not \u201cfree food,\u201d they\u2019re compensation for a system that fails to provide people basic necessities", "I'm not 100% sure, but I think the amount kf food stamps given is based on how many people live in the household. So if there are 2 adults and 1 child, that's what is allotted. Furthermore, those food stamps are to feed THAT HOUSEHOLD, and not just anyone. \n\nI say this because I know roommate situations get complicated when one person is on stamps and the other isn't.", "Fact", "Unfortunately putting him on blast would do nothing but get more people to pile on me.\n\nMany people in my family don't like my niece. Because my mom and I have always looked out for her and worked hard to get her out of a horrible situation we are the bad guys who have spoiled her and prioritized her over the other nibblings and grandkids in the family.\n\nSo all of them would agree that she is being greedy and spoiled", "I did respond to him and he basically said that he's done with me and my \"petty behavior\" and claims he won't come around anymore", "I know, that comment blew me.\n\nYes we get food stamps because we don't have enough money to buy food and he does!\n\nHe has more money than we could ever dream of having!!\n\nBut we're the ones better off because we get food stamps and are getting the food for \"free\"??", "Not as far as I know, he's always been extremely frugal and an asshole about his money and having to spend it ever since he was a teen and did odd jobs to earn money", "This is just speculation on my part but I do believe that he is taking her snacks and food out of pure spite.\n\nWhenever he comes over at non meal times, no matter the time of day, he ALWAYS makes sure to grab some of her snacks.\n\nHe is also always making comments about how she's spoiled and not the only grandchild or how we make everything about her.\n\nBut she's a CHILD and he's a grown ass man. I don't know why he thinks he should be cared for or given the same amount of attention or provided for in the same way as a literal child, but he definitely has some jealousy issues in regards to her", "I'm not letting him do anything, I've said stuff to him several times about asking him to stop and what not as far as my nieces snacks go. I'm usually not there so I can only do so much but after the fight yesterday he claims he won't ever come back much less eat our food but we'll see how long that lasts.", "One thing I am confident in is that he is not a groomer and is just an asshole.\n\nHe will occasionally do nice gestures for us, like buy the snacks, because he views it as a transaction. He did something nice for us, who are struggling, so now we owe him a favor, usually me helping him with something tech related for his business or using our printer etc.\n\nEverything \"nice\" he does has strings attached, but not those kinds of strings thankfully", "Be really careful where you store the snacks, getting someone with SN into the habit of thinking she must hide or stash her treasures and treats can backfire and cause other issues- disordered eating, binging because she thinks she must eat it all or she won\u2019t get any, ants or infestations because she has a food hoard in her bedroom, etc. I\u2019d suggest getting a lockable box or cabinet in the kitchen or pantry so that the food is stored where food should be but she has access and knows that her food is safely locked away from your greedy nephew.", "I have a suggestion: get a Sterilite plastic storage tub.  I have 2 and they\u2019re great, and they\u2019re the same tubs used to hold tools and laundry and other random stuff so no one bothers to check them.  Even better, put it in the closet and stack some stuff on top of it to make it look more natural.  Keeps my dad from finding my stash.", "Having to hide food at such a young age is a direct-pipeline to an eating disorder.", "Seriously. Yell out **\"do you want us to starve?!\"** every time he takes leftovers. Every. Damn. Time.\n\nHe's stealing food out of your mouths. He can afford his own food.\n\nMake your mom aware that he is stealing food out of your and your 7 year old niece's mouths too, not just hers. Being a doormat is not beneficial.\n\nOh and yes, absolutely, lock up the food. Lock up everything you can.", "I always keep my doors locked. Once I was sat in my living room after dinner and I heard someone try the locked front door. I looked outside and it was a man I didn't know. He ran off when he saw me.\n\nI have also seen people try to open my car door. \n\nThere are a lot of chancers who are easily deterred by locks.", "Good. Hold him to that.", "It definitely sounds like you all may need to sit down and lay cards on table. \n\nHe is an adult, she is a child.  They are both loved the same, but the child requires more support and discretion than a grown ass man who earns his own money...\n\nGood luck", "I am going to look into one", "Yea, I mean obviously she let people she doesn't know in the house but if she knows them, they've been invited to just walk in even without knocking.\n\nWhich I hate.\n\nI get yelled at whenever I'm home because I ALWAYS keep the doors locked and in her opinion if it's day time the doors have no business being locked", "Unfortunately at this point and time it would not be possible for me to move out and care for niece on my own, though it is a goal I'm working towards", "Start going to his house and taking away his things - toiletries, detergent, linen, his video games whatever catches your fancy. Tell him that he needs to learn to share and not be a greedy AH. Everyday he comes and takes something from your niece, he should get a visit from you and lose something of his own. He'll get the message quick enough.\n\nOther option - give your niece a spray bottle and teach her to spray him on the face every time he takes something of hers. \n\nBut first things first tell your Mom that you are considering alternate living arrangements for your niece because she's not safe with your nephew around. His behaviour will result in her getting an eating disorder in addition to her other medical problems. Since your mother prefers to enable your nephews entitled behaviour you think it's best to get your niece away from him. This should be a wakeup call for your mother to start setting and enforcing boundaries around him.", "Your mom is enabling an adult man to hurt a child.", "You need to tell your mum that what he is doing is literally abuse, and if your niece were to go to school and tell a teacher about her mean relative stealing food off of her plate and calling her names, then that teacher is legally required to report it to child services and have you and your mum investigated for child abuse. And if they find out that she knows what he\u2019s doing and just sits there and lets him do it, then they\u2019ll probably take away your niece because she isn\u2019t safe there.", "Weddings are for spendthrifts. Register at city hall.", "Surely they need to just lock the nephew out of the house? My brother and his family walk into my house without knocking, like they own the place. Even his wife\u2019s half sister just strolls in, one time I asked her to respect that this is my house, she got all passive aggressive.  \n\nSo anyway, now I lock the doors. Of course they don\u2019t have keys to my place. Problem solved. I\u2019ve even heard the half sister trying the door handle to just come in. She then doesn\u2019t knock or ring the bell, making me wonder...why was she trying to get in? Like I\u2019m second class citizen who doesn\u2019t have the right to have their own place? But now they done get in unless I let them.  \n\nOP would have to sit down with Mom and talk through how serious the situation is. Nephew can still come over, just for specific days for dinner once a week (once a month seems like it would be better). But he needs to have his unfettered access to the house rescinded. Locks may need to be changed, and Mom needs to understand the importance of keeping the doors locked *all the time.* But keeping him out and stopping this behaviour is, literally speaking, extremely easy."]}
