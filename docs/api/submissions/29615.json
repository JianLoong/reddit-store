My mom and I buy my niece snacks for school in bulk to last the month with foodstamps. My nephew is significantly more well-off than we are and is EXTREMELY frugal.\n\nBecause of my  moms open door policy regarding family members and food he will come to our house MULTIPLE times a day for food and drinks. He'll invite himself over for meals and eat more than his share as well as take home plates for leftovers leaving us with no leftovers ourselves.\n\nBut I draw the line at my neices snacks because they serve a purpose and we need them to last.

That she's not eating them so why can he have some.

Mom didnt say anything about it so she came to me and I called him out for taking the last brownie. \n\nHe got pissed and said she's spoiled, greedy, not the only grandkid, and he can eat here if he wants to. Then threw the brownie in the trash and stormed off. \n\nSo was I the asshole?  \n\nThere is alot more to the situation but due to the character limit I can go into more detail about everything that happened before this.\n\nEDIT: my nephew sent me this text a minute ago: \n\"I just got y'all snacks a few days ago. It's not like I'm coming over every day and eating all of y'all's food. You need to teach Jenna to share with people instead of being that fucking stingy about some snacks. \n\nIts terrible behavior for Jenna to act like that and do that fake cry about a snack she wasn't even eating. If your that tight on money that you want to come screaming at me over a 50\u00a2 snack cake then y'all need to really get your finances in order.  \n\nThere's plenty of food in there so y'all can't be starving that bad.  It was WRONG what you and Jenna did to me. I already know you won't care but I won't offer y'all snacks anymore and I won't eat y'all's food. It was honestly ridiculous you even did that to me over a snack cake. \n\nY'all get food stamps and shit I don't. It's also wrong that you encourage her with that type of behavior too. \"", "created_utc": 1698200563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fublo/aita_for_asking_my_nephew_m27_stop_eating_my/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
