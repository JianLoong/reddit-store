As long as you set some conditions for him to earn his door back (e.g., extra chores, grades, behavioral changes, apologizing for lashing out), I don't think it is an inappropriate punishment.

I have to wonder if the door really needed to be removed due to being broken. I had a broken door for years as a kid because of the time my insane bro tried to stab me. he carved a small hole into the door before giving up on that and started kicking the door, luckily the cheap material broke in a way that only his foot got through without the frame breaking and I managed to barricade the door with furniture before he could get in. this was a time before kids had cell phones and it was really only wealthy adults who had cell phones so I couldn't call for help. my parents attempted to force him to buy me a new door but gave up because he was too unruly so he went unpunished and I was stuck with a door that was hard to close for a few years, though my bro did eventually switch our doorknobs so i could lock my broken door again and he went without a doorknob for a few years. \n\nalso, I doubt termites like you suggest because that would effect the whole house not just one door and a problem like that you would have no choice but to look into. \n\nmaybe a week or two of no door is acceptable as punishment but it really should be replaced within a month. he's a boy. there are things he will do that you don't want to see, and not giving him space to, ahem, relieve himself, is not conducive to a healthy psychosexual development.", "YTA.

He obviously has no clue.  Have it be 2 pages MLA, correct grammar, etc with cited websites so you can check facts. Must be credible sources would talk to him with conditions and set a date to complete. If not completed correctly and on time the  you will remove all other distractions.

Also have him look up and explain the safety of why certain things should be attached to a wall and the consequences if its not. This would be a general discussion.  Then explain why you were freaked out  ensuing his understanding of why its dangerous using his parts of the discussion.  This can be done together. \n\nFYI:  I live in an earthquake state and we fasten anything heavy to the wall. Had to teach my kids at a young age not to climb and pull on furniture or heavy objects.

You may not live in earthquake area but freak accidents happen. \n\nOnce all conditions are met then he can have his TV back. If he says he is bored the have him wash baseboards. Somehow all bordom is cured when baseboads need washed.\n\nFor those who will say its too much. HES 16 NOT 5 and in 2 years he will legally be an adult with adult consequences.

Which can only end  badly.\n\nI  work with a guy with a mother like that, he's in his 40s and his mother is still trying to dictate his life. She'll show up unannounced at work and question coworkers about him, since he blocked her and doesn't want to talk or see her anymore.

Girl definitely put some effort and intentionality into breaking that shit.", "I can't stop laughing at the image of a really tiny 16 year old getting trapped behind a dresser", "As a child and teen I often had my door removed, privacy was a privilege along with other things.\n\nI am not a well adjusted adult let\u2019s just say that", "This is not normal in America.", "Yeah, it's pretty obvious the OP is changing details to make themself sound less crazy.", "Be careful with overdoing punishments.\n\nToo far and your adult son will never speak to you again.\n\nIn my experience most parents never even consider no contact to be a possibility until their children are gone from their lives for good.", "You broke his door. That\u2019s what happened. \n\nAny reasonable adult would immediately react with \u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Expecting more maturity than an adult from a teenage boy isn\u2019t reasonable.", "Based on this, I'm going to say YTA.\n\nAs parents we are 100% responsible for our children's behavior, and for fun - we're double responsible for our own behavior.\n\nTeenagers are shitheads - I remember being a shitty one myself.  To some degree we're getting paid back for being shitheads ourselves decades ago.\n\nI can understand the emotional reaction, but your son did not and only resorted to cursing and foul language after you had resorted to violent and ignorant behavior.\n\nYou have given more justification for not paying for a door, than you do for knocking the door down yourself in the first place.\n\nWould I have said something dumb to my daughter in similar circumstances, probably - but I'd still be the AH at end of the day.\n\nTelling a kid they can pay for a door you broke and forcing them to use a bathroom for privacy is a seriously asshole move and he called you out on it.  You don't get to wash hands of being the asshole because of (clutches pearls), gasp- a *curse word*\n\nYou were an asshole to the child and the child reflected it right back at you.", "Sounds like you should be trying to figure out what's wrong not take his privacy away", "Then if this deviates from his behaviour, something hints to me that something has escalated and feels anxious, needs more space and feels like you guys are hovering. Not right or wrong, every kid is built with different attachment styles and needs to handled within what you both are comfortable with. If you want to listen to every parent redditor with a power trip, fine, call him a bad kid, make it so he has no door, but even if you were right, you\u2019ve set the precedent on your relationship with your son to be one without trust. My gut instinct? Talk to your freakin kid, he probably feels smothered. Make a deal where you back off, let him figure his own space out but no more swearing to you, it\u2019s disrespectful. Replace the door that was YOUR doing, so you teach him everyone is not excluded from consequences even you. It\u2019s your choice", "From one parent of a teenager to another: If he's normally super easy-going, and this was an unusual circumstance, consider not taking stuff from him. Teenagers are people and have bad days, too. Talk to him about it, find out if something is stressing him out. Discuss your concerns. Replace the door and doorknob with something that can be unlocked with a penny or some other tool (these exist, just privacy locks). Throwing long-term punishments at him for one incident will only breed resentment and not get to the root of the problem.\n\nIf you need to figure out other consequences that directly relate to the major issues here, after talking to him, you can do that too. Taking away his door indefinitely seems disproportionate.", "I'm sorry, but this is sounding exactly like an overreaction my mother did had I was 17 and they never replaced my door.  Other things happened, but the end result is I left on my 18th birthday and don't speak to her anymore. \n\nI don't know the reality of this particular situation because we're only getting the story from you.  But I do think there are very few situations that justify completely and permenantly removing a teenager's door.  If you give him zero privacy this *will* escalate.", "I think you caught him masterbating and then declared you were removing his privacy in the same breath. Not saying it excuses the behavior, but certainly explains some of the emotions involved", "He was doing something so private and  he had the  tv in full blast  so he wpuldn't be heard . That is what happened .", "This might be not at all what happened, but I can tell you from experience that the only time I told my dad to fuck off was because I was embarrassed that he almost caught me masturbating.\n\n16 year old boy locking his door, having an unexplained loud noise, and refusing to answer the door, then getting uncharacteristically verbally abusive sounds like a scenario where he was trying to hide something, or was embarrassed about something and because he couldn't explain it, instead went straight to saying the worst thing to get you to go away.\n\nMight be way off, but just brought back that embarrassing memory for me so thought I'd share", "Exactly she should just do some type of normal punishment. Not completely make his room not have a door.", "That's a horrible advice though.  I've seen men that treat their mothers like Queens,  but turn around and abuse their wives.", ">100%, if my son spoke to me the way OPs son spoke to her no door would be the least of his punishments.\n\nPretty sure my response would be to say \"I'm gonna go think of a proper punishment for the way you've acted. You might want to start praying.\" And then I would try to think up something that will make the lesson stick without traumatizing them for life. \n\nLike, I want my kid to respect me, but not to the point of fearing for their safety. Maybe take away some luxuries (phone/tablet/TV), and ground them for an appropriate amount of time.", "Absolutely agree. I'm disheartened that so few people understand that privacy is super important and, although he sounds like a little shit, he's still a person.\n\nAnd not having a door is a fire risk.\n\nTaking away his TV is an appropriate punishment. He shouldn't have a TV in his room anyway because it's super bad for sleep hygiene.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: based on OP's comment below, he *isn't* normally a little shit so removing his door is incredibly inappropriate.", "Is it a HUGE dresser or a tiny teenager?

My mom never caught me masturbating but \"found\" (aka purposefully looking for something \"bad\") and found a sex story I had written when I was 16 and shamed me into oblivion for having normal, sexual thoughts that I kept entirely to myself. The sex story was absolutely nothing alarming just like, about a consensual handjob. Lol.", "Too many of these comments reading like r/relationship_advice where every sudden and relatively minor conflict must end in divorce or breakup.  Both kids and adults can have bad days and reflexively speak a bit coarse than normal and still be caring and loving people every other day of the year, it's human emotion, and kids especially teenagers lack full control over those emotions but that often should start with a short but direct conversation.  I've had instances where I talked a bit more aggressive towards someone accidentally to which they made me aware so then I was able to check myself and overall I'm much more able to control thoughts of frustration and release them in less socially disrespectful ways.", "Excellent point, I hadn't even thought of this. Yes, for the sake of safety and because teens do need a bit of privacy, do replace the door. But no need for a lock and definitely no need for a TV.", "And he\u2019ll have a visual reminder of how much he screwed up.", "Yeah I grew up in a home where the only locks were on bathroom doors and even those were only necessary when company was over. If a door is shut, you knock and wait to be admitted.", "But in all seriousness that pain and shame that wouod have instilled in you would be horriffic. My rents were religious fruitcakes im gunna guess yours are aswell", "It\u2019s such an important time in terms of your body and sexuality - it\u2019s really cruel to not give kids privacy. There may be extreme circumstances but those aren\u2019t this.", "Exactly. This was my first thought. Everyone takes at face value that he was trying to watch the movie and what he said is gospel truth. What is he going to say, \"You interrupted me masturbating?\"", "For sure. Oh yeah definitely, my mom is the Christian freak and not my dad really. Sorry you were being watched by your mom jerking off that also sounds horrifying", "Manufactured crisis. That's the term I was looking for. That's exactly what this sounded like to me too. \n\nPoor kid was probably just sick of his mom screeching from all the way across the house constantly and chose not to respond to her. So she manufactured a crisis to seem like she was concerned for his welfare when really it was about exerting control over him. \n\nOP isn't just an asshole she is downright abusive. This has r/RaisedByNarcissists written all over it", "You can see the authoritarian bent in the comments and people uncritically accepting OPs narrative. People are always like 'Its your door/TV/whatever so you can do whatever you want and punish anybody who disagrees with you however you'd like'.\n\nThe top 10 comments just accept the OPs, inconsistent, version of events and justify that crazy behavior.  A 16 year old boy and OP is worried about a dresser falling on him?  She can't understand why he isn't answering but fails to notice the loud TV until she breaks the door down?  Then, after kicking her son's door in she decides she can do whatever she wants as punishment because he was verbally upset at her for literally breaking his door down.\n\nWhile technically true that the parent controls everything, good luck maintaining a relationship with your children when they grow up and have no legal obligation to see you.  This is either fake (most likely), or the person in the OP believes the role of a parent is to be a dictator.  He'll be an adult soon and OP will be making posts about her ungrateful son who never visits despite her being a perfect mother and everyone will tell her she's NTA not because it is the truth, but because OP isn't self-aware enough to see her own flaws.\n\nThe kid's 16, if he's locked in his room and not responding he probably wants privacy.  The idea that he was somehow killed by furniture just sounds like it is an after the fact justification for the OP getting angry and kicking the door open.", "That thought makes me really sad for him"]}
