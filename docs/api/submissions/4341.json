Your home, your space, your rules.  \n\n\nHowever, I would like to play devil's advocate on the topic of I feel your mother may have not told you in order to protect you in respect of your trauma. You also weren't invited to her place for Christmas, again to keep you away from your abuser. No one enjoys having information kept from them. However, I think with both tidbits of information, it becomes a very different story than if only you had not been told about her living there, but you were also invited over for Christmas (or vice versa).   \n\n\nYour mother made her choice to still care for her daughter, no matter her problems. Whether or not you agree with those choices is only an opinion. I personally believe she is doing what she can to keep all of her children happy, safe, and healthy. I'd confront her and ask why she did not tell you, I would not be surprised if the answer was to not bring up any negative feelings.", "NTA.  Do something with your younger sibling.  Tell mother you simply changed your mind.  No reason to bend over backwards to give this person information.  Maybe cut contact.", "NTA \n\nIf you're not comfortable telling her that you know you can just say you want some one-on-one sibling bonding time with your youngest sibling and just hang out with them. That being said you are well within your rights to tell her how her choices have made you feel.", "NTA. You have every right to be hurt and protect yourself with boundaries. I'm sorry for what you went through you didn't deserve the abuse that your mom should have protected you from. I'm concerned about your sibling who told you the truth because she shouldn't be forced to live with her abuser again and your mother needs to put her safety first but clearly isn't. Maybe you can invite her to stay with you but I don't know your situation. I just want both of you to be safe.", "Yeah, I'd say NTA but it might be worth confronting mom on this before un-inviting her (maybe leave out that your younger sibling told you so as to not betray their trust - there's certainly other ways you could have potentially found out).  I don't know your family so I can't say what your relationship with your mother is like, but I just know my instinct would be to talk it out before burning bridges.  But again, not in your situation so I can understand if that's not really an option after the stuff you've gone through (though I assume regardless if you un-invite her you'll probably have to say something about why).", "You don't have to expose that your sister told you. A simple way of exposing your mother is to go over to her house, when you know she's home, on the pretext of dropping something off or picking up your sister. Do this without letting her know that you're going over. Lie exposed.", "NTA But I don\u2019t think you are going about it correctly. I would not keep it a secret. You don\u2019t have to rat out your siblings that told you specifically, but you can and should at the very least let your mom know you are no longer inviting her to Christmas because of the lies and deception she has been telling you the last few months. Also that you expect her to be honest with you and also not gaslight you into believing something not true or manipulate you into doing things away from her apartment to keep her secret. \nYou don\u2019t have to tell her how you found out about your abusive sister living there. She can be suspicious of them, but without verification, it would be mere speculation on her part that they told you. \n\nYou have a right to set boundaries that prevent her from hurting you. This is emotional abuse. So stand firm to your boundaries and let her deal with the consequences of her actions accordingly.", "NTA but I think you need to protect your youngest sister and stage a way of finding out", "Certainly your right not to have her. She did lie and it's obvious your sister did some things. NTA.....\nI am gonna get creamed for this, but I am more curious than accusatory...how does your sister who's 2 yrs younger become that much of a threat to you? You even call her your abuser.  I'm not saying a little sister can't make someone's life hell at times, I'm just curious how it rises to this level. Is there some sort of power dynamic that we don't know of? I'm trying to put myself in your shoes and just having a difficult time seeing it. Obviously you can not answer or tell me to mind my damn business.", "Your sister doesn\u2019t even want to help herself, and your mom is just spitting in the wind trying to help someone who doesn\u2019t want to be helped. I would uninvite her from Christmas and go NC with her. There is no reason you need to keep subjecting yourself to unfair treatment.", "NTA..  but I'd be less concerned that she lied to you & more concerned if you still have siblings living with her.", "NTA. Move the dinner to a restaurant so if it goes to hell she isn't making you feel unsafe in your home", "NTA But tell her you know what's going on. See what she says and then decide if you're comfortable spending time with her knowing that she's supporting your abuser. Remember that she isn't endangering you, she's telling lies to keep her relationship with your sister private.\n\nI think that the lying was her way of trying to protect everyone. She feels like she needs to support her daughter despite her mental health issues and behavior, but she also knows that she needs to protect you and your sister from her. The best way that she knew to do that was to keep everyone separate and not talk about it which is blowing up in her face now.", "NTA is your younger sibling safe? Can you get them out?", "NTA, but if she had to move out because she was a danger to your younger sibling, how was she able to move back in? If there\u2019s some kind of protective order in place I\u2019d report the violation.", "NTA but if your sister is still living there please if you can get her out.  After reading additional comments please inform adult social care and ask for support for your younger sister point out your didter has been removed for youngest safty and is now back tgat your momgas put ger at risk and see what can be done", "NTA You have every right to uninvite her. She has repeatedly chosen your abuser over you and it's time to put a stop to it. Do whatever you need to do for yourself. Don't worry about how it will affect anyone else. You are perfectly ok for how you feel. Do not let anyone make you feel guilty either.", "NTA. Consider getting your youngest sister out of that situation if you can", "NTA, but please have your sibling over.  You need to realize your mom\u2019s relationship with your sister and your relationship with you sister are two different things.  This should be about mom lying to you and nothing else.  Mom will suffer for actions in having a drug addict live with her, that\u2019s karma.  Sit back, grab popcorn and under no circumstances help your mother.  She is enabling.", "YWBTA. The only reason you would be uninviting her to dinner is to punish her. I understand that her lying has hurt you, but talk it out with her first. You already know why she lied to you - she wants to help her daughter and knew it would upset you.", "Yikes, going ESH on this one.\n\nClearly, your mom knows that you would be ballistic and that's why she lied and didn't want you over. That's definitely a breach of trust given the abuse and emotions you feel.\n\nBut it's also HER daughter. You cannot demand or force her to abandon that relationship. You CAN decide to cut contact with your mom, and absolutely refuse to have any contact or involvement otherwise regarding your sister.\n\nI get the anger, but it's not your place to dictate THEIR relationship. It's clearly messed up and toxic, but that's for your Mom to address and handle.\n\nYWBTA as you've promised not to tell the mom. It sounds like you and the younger sibling need to have the confrontation, and decide if you want to keep the relationship active or not.", "ESH.\n\nShe told you a lie to spare your feelings about your sister living with her. Would it be better for her to intentionally trigger your CPTSD and anxiety? I don't think she's making great choices, but the lie was about something complicated.\n\nI think uninviting her rather than talking about it is juvenile. If you uninvite her, she's not going to know why unless you tell her. I understand you don't want to rat out your other sibling, but is there another way you could present this - that you saw your sister's car at her house or something like that? Some other \"grapevine\" you could have heard through? Respond to a lie by uninviting someone to a holiday with no explanation sounds like it will escalate the issue. If the concern is about your youngest sibling's safety, then making this about Christmas dinner and not finding them a safe place to live would also make you TA.", "NTA\n\nBut put yourself in your mother's shoes. You're asking her to choose 1 daughter over the other. How can anyone make that choice? I'm not saying what your mother did is right by lying to you. But I can understand how a person would lie so that she can maintain a relationship with all her children. \n\nI think you need to decide if you can accept your mom exactly the way she is.", "They are. I don\u2019t think they would be in danger from my mom finding out, though.", "Yeah, I think this is the most important thing.", "NTA- this is what I was thinking, as well.  If you can take it.  Drop off a rotisserie chicken or something because \nyou know your mom has been working hard.  \nThen you officially know and aren't betraying your youngest sibling.  \nOf course, you have to be okay with this strategy.", "I think it hurts because she always claimed she would put me and my sibling first because of how my sister has hurt us. But that\u2019s clearly not what happening now. I\u2019m also upset with how this has negativity effected my sibling, they\u2019ve really struggled with living with my sister and wants to go NC with her but they\u2019re not able to move out because of their health.", "They are safe for now. I would have got them out as soon as I found out about this if I had the means to provide for their health issues. I live in a tiny one bedroom with my boyfriend and both of us work full time. I have offered to have them over as much as they want if they need to avoid my sister, and I hope soon I will have the money to afford a place where they can come stay with me.", "Unfortunately no, if there was it would have been up to my mom to file it and she very clearly doesn\u2019t prioritize protecting my sibling from her.", "How come uninviting would mean they want to punish her? It could also simply just be because they are hurt they were lied to several times\u2026", "It's perfectly reasonable to cut ties with someone who lies to you about something like this.", "Clarifying that I never tried to get her to stop talking to my sister, I never demanded anything of my mom in this regard. My mom however promised to put me and my sibling first because of how my sister abused us, and that\u2019s obviously not happening now (especially given my sibling is now forced to live with their abuser).", "Just to clarify, I never said I was going to uninvite her without explaining why or talking to her about it first. Apologies if it sounded that way. I also don\u2019t think the lie is harmless or selfless, just that she knows she is putting my sister first when she swore she would never do that.", "To clarify; I\u2019m not asking her to choose. I\u2019m asking her to keep her promise to put me and my sibling first. Also I\u2019m a guy lol", "Okay, would they be in danger from your sister finding out, possibly through your mom? Forgive my questions, I'm just very worried about the safety of everyone living with your sister, particularly your youngest sibling who may not have anywhere else to go.", "I see. At that point, you need to make a decision to either cut her off or work with your mother. She may say she\u2019ll put you and your sibling first but that\u2019s not the case because she\u2019s supporting your abuser and it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019ll drop her anytime soon. I would talk to her first and give her the ultimatum and see what she says.", "This!! Nobody is entitled to a place on your life, not even a parent", "I thought you were saying you wouldn't confront her about the lie, sorry I misunderstood. \n\nI responded the way I did because you said the lie was the problem. I don't think the lie itself is the problem, because telling you the truth about it would hurt your feelings (which is why you are now hurt), so lying makes sense. If the problem is that she took in your sister, then it's not the lie that's the problem it's her choices. And I think it's perfectly reasonable to be upset with her for that.", "I think you'll find your definition of putting you and your sister first different than your mom's definition. Just as what you think is fair is different than what your mom thinks is fair. \n\nFor example, just making this up as I don't know your situation and I thought you were female, I apologize, BTW: Mom thinks she's putting you two first by going to a Christmas party at your house. She'll have to leave the abuser at home by herself which mom doesn't want to do at Christmas of all times.\n\nI'm assuming her youngest does not live at home. If she does, then yeah, I'd be pretty pissed at your mom.", "I don\u2019t think my sister knows about the situation, and rather it\u2019s just something my mom has decided to avoid talking about. I definitely wouldn\u2019t try telling anyone anything that would put my sibling in danger.", "I understand your viewpoint, thank you for the input.", "My youngest sibling does still live at home with my mom, and has been struggling with dealing with my sister. She wants to go NC but can\u2019t move out because of some really serious health reasons. I\u2019m mostly angry that she put my sibling in this situation and didn\u2019t tell me, I\u2019m assuming because she knows it\u2019s messed up of her to do.", "Okay, gotcha, and I didn't mean to imply that you would, so I'm sorry if I came off that way. Going back to your original point, I think it's a good idea for you to bring this up and set healthy boundaries for yourself. Your youngest sibling might be upset, but this is someone dangerous to be around and that deserves to be taken seriously. Good luck!", "With that information.

I detest liars, especially when it involves covering up for someone who is an actual danger to others. You've said your youngest sibling asked you not to tell your mom, but perhaps you could drop by, like \"I was just in the area & wanted to pop in for a moment to say hi\", that way the youngest sibling won't have \"told you\".
