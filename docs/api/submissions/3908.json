Feels like it's borderline financial abuse to keep you relying on him. Red flag!", "NTA. And you actually have the better argument that he shares his money and reimburse you for your childcare (obviously these are your kids so it would be crazy to actually do it. But that\u2019s his logic, so go with it)", "Ok. So he gets a portion of your dog sitting money for the inconvenience of the dogs being in the home in his presences - as soon as he pays you a share of this coaching money for being the sole caretaker of your children while he\u2019s coaching. Bet he\u2019d owe you more than you\u2019d have to pay him.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds quite self-centred.", "NTA. I don't have words. Your husband is extremely in the wrong here. Like why does he even work that much, leaving you alone with two small kids ask the time??\n\nDo NOT give in, keep that money and ask yourself if you're being treated right in this marriage.", "NTA. If he doesn't share his extra money, neither should you.", "NTA - unless he does a substential part of the dog sitting, the money should be shared as much as any other (side-) income: it's all yours!\nIf he has a full-time and and a part time job does he even get to see his children? If your main job is housemaker and caretaker, does he a least compensate you by contributing into your savings and retirement account? And I really hope he shares the money and doesn't put you on an allowance or something like that.", "NTA, but please take care of yourself. It is incredibly concerning that in his eyes he can have separate finances but you can\u2019t.", "NTA. Don't discuss it with him, his take on it is irrational. Make sure you keep that money safe, you'll need it one day from the sound of it...", "NTA. You have a 10 week old newborn and your sad sack of a husband takes 4 hours every weekday AND Saturday to coach soccer? That alone is enough to make him a gaping AH. But he also keeps the money he makes for himself? Are you sure he\u2019s not out there with his side piece and that\u2019s why he refuses to share his earnings? Because he has no money to show for it? This has to be fake.", "What does this man bring to the table...?\n\nIt sounds like nothing.\n\nYou know you're not the asshole.\n\nLeave him. Save yourself the next 10 years of your life. You're already doing it all anyway.", "NTA. He actually owes you money that he gets from soccer because you're at home babysitting HIS kids. If he's away for four hours every day, he owes you two hours. Without you he wouldn't be able to get a second job.", "NTA\n\nTell your husband you\u2019re willing to split the dog sitting money with him as long as he splits his coaching money with you!

Unless you are leaving him to take care of the dog, he doesn't get a share of the dog sitting income. And you two should still be splitting childcare time.", "NTA.  Either your side hustles are shared because they inconvenience the other spouse, or they belong entirely to the spouse making the money, but that should be consistent.  Any costs related to the side hustle should likewise either both be shared or both be separate.", "NTA. Maybe he ought to pay for a sitter when he works his side gig. Or pay you a for wage.", "NTA- if you have to split your money he has to split his money, fair is fair.", "You have a day job, a side gig and you\u2019re caring for a newborn and a toddler? NAH - And take care of yourself. Sounds like you\u2019ve got your hands full. You sure the side gig is worth it?", "Nta", "We both work 9-5\u2019s in tech so I\u2019m not just a SAHM.

Does coaching most of the rest if the time. \n\nHe's a negligent dad and useless husband. Id split the time with the kids 50-50 and leave him to sort it out himself", "Nta if you keep all money separate you should keep this money for yourself.", "Man, that\u2019s really tough. You deserve the side gig cash, but please try and find time for yourself.", "NTA. I'm just going to come out and say it. Your husband sounds greedy. Not just with his money, but with his time, too (staying away from the family so much, leaving you to take care of everyone). If there is one thing that is absolutely, completely essential in a partnership, it's generosity. When it feels like the generosity is one sided, the partnership starts feeling one sided.

It shows a real lack of respect for you and that he doesn't see his children as his responsibility.", "I'm hard pressed to believe that guy spends four hours a day, sox days a week, coaching anything.", "NTA. Are any of your kids on the soccer team he coaches? If not, that's odd. Keeping things separate when you're married doesn't seem too healthy. If none of your kids are on the team, I'd talk to him about prioritizing your marriage so you can raise your kids the best you can. Perhaps you can use the dog sitting situation as a way to talk to him about this.", "NTA\n\nYour husband can't have his cake and eat it too. It's either both share or both keep.", "NTA", "NTA but this is a red flag you really need to acknowledge", "NTA. Agreed with other redditors that this behavior is concerning.

His money is his money and your money is family money!\n\nJust no!\n\nBut this is a massive red flag. You can\u2019t bend on this. But I would check your household finances properly", "NTA. Hide your money well.", "NTA\n\nYou could suggest that you take another job outside the house while he looks after the kids so that he's not \"inconvenienced\" by having a dog in the house. \n\nThen watch his mental gymnastics as he explains how that's totally different and unfair and he should also have that money.", "He is TA big-time. AND you take care of your small kids? You must be exhausted. He sounds like an egocentric control freak. NTA", "Tell him YOU will share when HE does.  Simple.  Keep what you make in another account.  If hubs doesn't SEE his outside activity TAKING away from his own children, you have a LOT bigger problems with another LARGE toddler called hubs/more concerning is his considering that house HIS!!!!!!!!", "ESH, why are you even together.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHE is an AH.", "Then this should be no different - NTA", "That's it. He is intentionally trying to slow you down. He likes you taking care of the kids so he can do what he wants. He sounds incredibly selfish.\n\nEdit to add: NTA", "Another word for this is sabotage.
