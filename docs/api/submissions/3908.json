Unless you are leaving him to take care of the dog, he doesn't get a share of the dog sitting income. And you two should still be splitting childcare time.", "NTA.  Either your side hustles are shared because they inconvenience the other spouse, or they belong entirely to the spouse making the money, but that should be consistent.  Any costs related to the side hustle should likewise either both be shared or both be separate.", "NTA. Maybe he ought to pay for a sitter when he works his side gig. Or pay you a for wage.", "NTA- if you have to split your money he has to split his money, fair is fair.", "You have a day job, a side gig and you\u2019re caring for a newborn and a toddler?

Id split the time with the kids 50-50 and leave him to sort it out himself", "Nta if you keep all money separate you should keep this money for yourself.", "Man, that\u2019s really tough. You deserve the side gig cash, but please try and find time for yourself.", "NTA. I'm just going to come out and say it. Your husband sounds greedy. Not just with his money, but with his time, too (staying away from the family so much, leaving you to take care of everyone). If there is one thing that is absolutely, completely essential in a partnership, it's generosity. When it feels like the generosity is one sided, the partnership starts feeling one sided.

Are any of your kids on the soccer team he coaches? If not, that's odd. Keeping things separate when you're married doesn't seem too healthy. If none of your kids are on the team, I'd talk to him about prioritizing your marriage so you can raise your kids the best you can. Perhaps you can use the dog sitting situation as a way to talk to him about this.", "NTA\n\nYour husband can't have his cake and eat it too. It's either both share or both keep.", "NTA", "NTA but this is a red flag you really need to acknowledge", "NTA. Agreed with other redditors that this behavior is concerning.

Hide your money well.", "NTA\n\nYou could suggest that you take another job outside the house while he looks after the kids so that he's not \"inconvenienced\" by having a dog in the house. \n\nThen watch his mental gymnastics as he explains how that's totally different and unfair and he should also have that money.", "He is TA big-time.

He\u2019s not a father if his side hustle takes him away from his family that long and often. You\u2019re basically a single mum all weekdays.

Too many red flags here tbh, something isn't adding up.", "NTA but you have 2 children that he appears to avoid all work in relationto them.

Your position is completely valid. If he starts sharing the coaching income 50/50 then you start sharing the dog sitting money 50/50.

Your logic is good.", "NTA.", "Why are you married to a paycheque!? That\u2019s all he is, if he is away that long and he doesn\u2019t parent your children or being a partner to you.

Please explain to me how your husband, who lacks all manner of logic in his bid to split your hard-earned money, has managed to convince you that you might be in the wrong here?  He is seriously gas-lighting you, and it needs to stop.  To drive your point home, hand him an invoice for the four hours of childcare you do alone while he is coaching, and tell him that you will expect this to be paid before he gets half of your dog-sitting money.
