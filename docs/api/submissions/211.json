Unfortunately with parents the whole \u201cyou\u2019re too young to be stressed\u201d is all too common. \n\nI come from a mixed family, would it be possible to sit down and point out to her that where you are currently IS your \u201creal world\u201d? And while you don\u2019t have (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) bills and work and all that. The expectations of you are your equivalent? Maybe see if your school has a therapist you can access to talk to about this, and something I\u2019ve done that worked for me is to be around my family (because they always pulled the why aren\u2019t you around us stuff) but not speak unless spoken too. Really puts them on edge when you seem quiet. \n\nI wish the best", "NTA.\n\nYour problems are \"real world problems\" and your feelings are valid. Just because you're not an adult with a job and a mortgage or rent to pay doesn't mean your problems and stress are invalid.\n\nBeing a teenager is hard, especially if you feel like you have to be perfect and live up to someone else's expectations. \n\nI really recommend you see if your school has some sort of counselor you can ask to talk to. You're not alone in the world.", "NTA\nI understand your position because I\u2019m in it too. My parents have started joking that if they don\u2019t want me somewhere, all they have to do is go there (because I usually leave if I have to be alone with them). But, prioritize what you want. Then do the work they tell you, and if you can\u2019t, just tell them \u201cim sorry I forgot\u201d or \u201csorry, I\u2019ll get to it when I can\u201d. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s worked for me. Sorry I don\u2019t have better advice", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re being put thru all this. At your age you should be being supported while focusing on school. Of course, chores are to be expected, but not to the point of being overwhelmed with depression. You do need to talk to someone to help you process and learn coping skills. My hope for you is that your mother has an epiphany and starts doing right by you.", "NTA\n\nSometimes it\u2019s hard for adults to remember and understand what the pressures of being a teenager are. Since we all survived it, it somehow feels less hard now that we\u2019ve had distance from it. \n\nThat being said, being a teenager IS hard. And feeling the pressure of unrealistic expectations isn\u2019t fair or easy.  \n\nI don\u2019t know your mom well enough to know if she would ever be open enough to truly hear you, but I hope that she chooses the opportunity to fix her relationship with you instead of clinging to her pride. She seems to care a lot more about how this looks than how you feel, and I don\u2019t know if she will change. If she can\u2019t, it\u2019s ok for you to keep the peace in order to make it to adulthood and then seek help on your own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
