{"id": 25715, "submission_id": "163lb5z", "title": "AITA for telling my husband not to spend so much time with his exes?", "selftext": "**Throwaway**\n\nThrough a series of choices, my (F36) husband Josh (M38) has 2 children from 2 previous relationships. Jess (F37) has a son aged 9, and Sarah (F30) has a daughter aged 4. Despite separating from these women, Josh has remained very close friends with both of them and has taken an active role in raising both of his children.\n\nWhen I said that Josh has remained close friends with his exes, I mean really close. He covers all childcare costs for both children and even covers some of the living expenses of both Jess and Sarah. Last month, it was Jess\u2019s birthday, and he bought her a very expensive watch. Just last weekend, he went out to dinner with Sarah while Sarah\u2019s sister babysat their daughter. There are some other examples of him spending time with them that also come to my mind as well.\n\nSince I have my own kid on the way (in a few weeks), I am starting to feel a bit overlooked and think that Josh needs to prioritize our needs first. Josh makes quite a lot of money, and every time I hinted at my concerns in the past, he has always brushed them off and said things like how he is more than capable of providing for his children. But, I feel that he\u2019s missing the point and avoids addressing the time he spends with his exes.\n\nI\u2019ve grown increasingly frustrated with these circumstances, so I confronted him about them this morning before he went to work. I was pretty angry when I spoke with him, and he could definitely tell by my tone. He did listen to everything I had to say and then said that he\u2019d make an effort to spend more time with me and that he was sorry he made me feel this way.\n\nWhen I mentioned that I wanted him to spend less time with Jess and Sarah and their kids, he became defensive. He said that his children were his number one priority, that the time he spent with them was non-negotiable, and that he\u2019d never compromise his commitment to them. When I mentioned our own kid's needs, he told me that didn\u2019t change anything and that the conversation was over. He left for work shortly afterwards.\n\nAITA?\n\nMore context: For those wondering, my husband spends roughly 3-4 days each week with his children. It's pretty common that he spends some nights over at their homes.", "created_utc": 1693227202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163lb5z/aita_for_telling_my_husband_not_to_spend_so_much/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All she can do is sit down and discuss boundaries with the exes and see how it goes when she has the baby. If he doesn\u2019t care about the new kid and puts exes and other kids above their child then I can see where there would be a problem. But, he makes lots of money so as long as she\u2019s able to take care of her child and as long as he is supporting both of them to the same extent as he is the exes then she has a choice she can either accept the situation or move on with their child and collect child support since that seems like the only thing he\u2019s gonna do for them anyway.\n\nI do wonder since he has two baby mamas and another one what his deal is.

If he is spending the night with his exes, that\u2019s where the problem is. Of course he should spend time with his other kid but what about her child?\n\nI would question the spending the night. So does her child just get leftovers? If he has the time? Is it gonna be involved with this new child\u2019s life? It doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nThey need to sit down and discuss the situation. He should be able to see his kids whenever he wants. As far as the exes go there needs to be  boundaries. Because where does his wife and new child come into the picture? I see where she\u2019s coming from, yes I know it\u2019s jealousy however he doesn\u2019t seem to be spending any time with his wife and new Child.\n\nHe\u2019s made a half assed promise to spend time with her and their so it\u2019s up to her to wait it out and see if he comes through with that promise. The new child should not come second to the other children. They all should be treated equally. And as his wife she should be a priority over his exes.\n\nAll I could say is right now until the baby is born and she sees how things go then she needs to make a decision that\u2019s right for her. It doesn\u2019t sound like he has enough time for her or for his future child. He\u2019s already said they come first. It\u2019s not the fact that they come first it\u2019s the fact that the new child will always be second place.

Right now he spends three to four days with each child. With baby #3 coming, each child will get 2-3 days. OP is upset because she wants her chops to be prioritized but that wouldn\u2019t be fair to the other kids. They should each get the same amount of time with their dad.

I was wondering about a potential pattern in his behaviour. As far as you inderstand he was supportive during pregnancies... Can you say that he is not for yours ?\n\nThis being said, I still think that asking for spending less time with kids/exes is an AH move. Demanding higher presence, help and care during your pregnancy last weeks and early times with new born is more productive.", "I can see him taking a trip with just him and his kids and just with you but how does he seem to think it\u2019s OK to leave you and just take his exes?

I also worry that his time is going to be spent with the other exes and you and your child will have to take the leftovers. He can\u2019t continue on this path forever.\n\nYou are his wife and should be a priority over the exes. The kids of course a priority as long as your child is a priority too. It is disrespectful he is spending the night with the exes. You are married he should be staying the night with you and your future child. You have to make the decision that you\u2019re OK with this because I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll change. I just wonder if he\u2019s still having an affair with the exes?", "No spending the night with his exes is not a marriage. It is disrespectful to his wife. It is a sister wife situation. He\u2019s also admitted that he\u2019s not spending enough time with her and their future child. He\u2019s not willing to give up his time with these other women. He is not treating his wife like a wife. That is going to continue with this new child. When\u2019s he going have time for all this? He works spends 3 to 4 days a week with the other family where does that leave her and her Child. \nI highly doubt that the situation will change. She has to decide whether she wants to be second to the other Sister wives.\n\nNot much you can do right now until the child comes and see if he\u2019s willing to give equal treatment to the new child and to her. I think she needs counseling to make the correct decision. He obviously will pay child support so maybe that\u2019s the reason she stays is money.", "lmao", "How many days is in a week to you? Eight? He has to work too. He also spends the night with the ex\u2019s where does that leave the wife and future child. How does he explain well I can\u2019t stay with you for a couple of days because I have to be with my other kids.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry there\u2019s not eight days in a week and there\u2019s only 24 hours in a day. So he won\u2019t be spending more time with this new child because he has made the other children a priority. He\u2019s even admitted that. So it\u2019s up to his wife to decide where she wants to be in this mess. It\u2019s probably because of money it sounds like he has money so she can either stay and not be a priority or she can accept the situation and start saving for when things get too bad. I hope she does this because no matter what this can\u2019t go on forever.\n\nWhat she gonna do when another woman gets pregnant or one of the sister wives get pregnant? Being his wife hopefully she qualifies for alimony and child support I think that\u2019s where she\u2019s headed.", "The problem is they\u2019re not getting equal time he\u2019s making his first family a priority over his wife and their child. He\u2019s already said he will try and spend more time with her but that\u2019s just placate the wife because she\u2019s complaining that he\u2019s hardly ever there. There\u2019s no problem with him seeing his children whenever he can but when he starts spending the nights at the exes house that\u2019s where the problem comes in I think he\u2019s cheating on her personally.\n\nIt\u2019s great he can see his other kids but what about their child. He works, Spends 3 to 4 days and nights with the other kids And their mothers where does that leave his wife. I would never tolerate him not coming home and spending the night with me especially when I\u2019m pregnant.\n\nShe needs counseling to decide how she wants to proceed. He obviously has money so maybe being a sister wife is best at this point as long as he\u2019s supporting her as much as he\u2019s supporting his exes.

He makes promises he will spend more time with her and their child but whether or not he proves that is another story.\n\nAll she can do is wait and see and if he continues on this path she might be better off just divorcing him collecting child support or alimony and moving on with someone who only loves her.\n\nThere\u2019s no saying that he\u2019s going to treat this child the same. He\u2019s already admitted that he doesn\u2019t spend as much time with her now as he should. Who\u2019s to say that he\u2019s going to keep going status quo.

They are married now he should be home spending the night with his wife and future child. I don\u2019t see this working out, because he\u2019s already admitted that he doesn\u2019t spend as much time with her as he should. But if she\u2019s willing to put up with it that\u2019s on her. She needs counseling to decide where this is going to go and she should start it now Before the baby is born.

He said he would try and do better but I highly doubt it. He spending the night with his ex, he needs to be home at night with his wife.

He\u2019s so involved in his exes and their kids when is he gonna have time. I guess he needs to spend time with his other kids but he also needs to spend time with this one. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna happen he\u2019s gonna be too busy. He works full-time and is spending 3 to 4 days with the sister wives even spending the night that is not a marriage. He needs to be home with his wife at night. However that is up to her if she\u2019s willing to continue the status quo.\n\nShe\u2019s too far gone now so she\u2019ll have to wait and see how things go after the baby is born. If he continues having her as an afterthought and their child then she needs to make that decision.", "He could be adding a 4th baby mama to the mix to round it out.", "Essentially yes", "Staying the night with his exes is suspicious. Especially as often as it happens. She is his wife and He should be sleeping at his house with his wife. Seeing his kids anytime is great spending time with his kids is great, but where does this leave his wife and his child they\u2019re having together? I also wonder if he\u2019s still cheating", "Good reply.\n\nAlso, there are only so many days and nights in a week. If he spends two nights with each ex and older child, and hopefully two nights with you and your child, what happens if you have a second child?", "There are three kids (with the unborn) two gets 3-4 days and the one get 3-4 days, how do you get that to be OP\u2019s kid gets less? \nIf the time is a problem why doesn\u2019t OP just invite the kids over to the house? My guess is her attitude towards her husbands ex wife\u2019s kids, not mentioned as also her husband kids.", "You knew what you were getting into, the man has children to look after just be grateful that he has a track record of being a good father to his kids and in turn you can expect the same when your child is born.", "Again, why is that a problem? You knew when you married him that he had two kids from two different women. I don\u2019t know why you decided to join this growing club of baby mamas, but you did. Did you really expect him to change the making of time he spends with his kids because you came into the picture? Here\u2019s a suggestion: why don\u2019t you ask your husband if his kids can spend a few days a week at your house? I\u2019m sure the mothers would enjoy having a break and you would get more time with your husband.", "So it sounds like you\u2019re all sister wives. Have you discussed this? I would have no problem with him taking care of his children and seeing them as often as he can but my concern would be where does that leave you and your child? I wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved with someone who has two baby mamas and Spends all his time with them. Why does he spend the night with his exes?\n\nI think marriage counseling is needed here. If he won\u2019t go then you need to get counseling for yourself to figure out how to deal with this. Again it\u2019s great he wants to spend time with his kids, but if you have to take a backseat to his exes and he treats your child with him as an afterthought then that would be where the problem is.", "I\u2019m gonna guess this arrangement and relationship with his exes existed before you came in the picture. Idk why you thought that you and the new baby were gonna roll in and change that dynamic. Based on his relationship with his other children and their mothers, there\u2019s no reason to think he won\u2019t treat your child equally right now.", "That\u2019s what happens when you marry a man with other baby mamas though? Different since there are other children involved so he\u2019s tied to them all\u2026", "You guys should probably all just move into a big house together and be sister wives, will be easier.", "we don\u2019t know if the other baby mamas are in relationships. it sus until you think about it  he works picks kid up made dinner they go the bed he takes them to school goes to work then home then next house. 3-4 days divided by 2 is 1-2 day for the kids to see their dad and 3-4 with her. if this arrangement was there before her idk why she thought it would change. the baby with get equal time with their dad as his siblings. as bad as it sounds yes the new baby gets the left over time he had a routine and responsibilities he\u2019s committed to and like i said equal time. the fact that he hasn\u2019t brought the kids to  the house he share with is wife maybe based of how entitled she is and how he thinks she may treat or say to them.", "My thought exactly. He doesn\u2019t seem to care about the baby mamas. Including his wife. He\u2019s so disrespectful to his wife. But if he has the money maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s in it. I think you\u2019re right he\u2019ll just keep having kids with whoever until his money runs out", "And you went ahead and married him, thinking you could change his routines when you got pregnant?", "My problem is spending the night with exes. There\u2019s no reason for it and it\u2019s disrespectful to his wife. There\u2019s no reason he can\u2019t see his other kids but he needs to come home to his wife and child.", "No he admitted to not spending enough time with his wife and unborn child. since there\u2019s only seven days in a week how is he going to spend the same amount of time with this child? He even spends the night with his exes. She has to decide if she wants to continue being a sister wife. He puts his other families as a priority over his wife and this child. How is he going to spend eight days a week with kids? He has to work too. \n\nHow long can he continue the schedule and how long before somebody feels left out and is left out?", "When\u2019s he gonna have time he\u2019s spending the majority of the time with his exes and their children. He\u2019s already admitted that he\u2019s not spending as much time with her as he should he said he\u2019ll do better. I doubt that\u2019s gonna happen.\n\nHe\u2019s so involved with his exes and their kids that he is forgetting his wife and this child when\u2019s he gonna have the time? He works he spends 3 to 4 days a week with his other families and really doesn\u2019t seem to care much about this child probably because he\u2019s got so much going on with the others.\n\nShe needs to see how things go and if he lives up to his promise. But I highly doubt he will. She is his wife he should be spending the night with her. Not the exes. See the kids all you want to come home to your wife and child. She\u2019s the one who has to decide if this is what she wants for future to be", "He is tied to them all. But where does his wife and new child come into the picture. Him spending the night with exes is suspect. He should be home with his wife at night and his child.\n\nHowever it\u2019s up to her if she wants to be the sister wife. Because this is what it sounds like. If he works full-time where does the new family come in to the picture because he spending more than half of his time with the other people. again I think it\u2019s great that he spends as much time as he can with his kids but with the exes? She\u2019s getting leftovers.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why she decided to get pregnant with this guy. She needs counseling and if she can\u2019t accept being a sister wife then she needs to decide how she wants to continue. Obviously he\u2019ll pay child support so that\u2019s not an issue. I wouldn\u2019t want to be in the middle of this personally but if she can accept it then that\u2019s the way it is, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s accepting it. And he is neglecting her.\n\nShe\u2019s so far in the middle of this I don\u2019t think she understands the situation. She needs counseling to figure out how she wants to move forward because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to give up the exes and she is going to become an afterthought. He\u2019s already made that clear. But if she puts up with it then that\u2019s on her she is his wife It should be treated as such but it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s doing that. I think maybe she staying with him because of the money. Just like the others put up with him because of the money.", "It\u2019s more like the other baby mamas never really stopped being \u201chis women\u201d. They should all just live together at this point.", "I knew he'd be involved in his children's lives, but I had not anticipated he was going to be these invested or friendly with his exes", "He spend 3-4 days with the two kids, that 1 1/2-2 days per kid, that means there are 3-4 days left in the week for OP\u2019s kid. Those 3-4 days I would presume is also working days, since most people work 5 days a week and there\u2019s only 2 days in the weekend. \nThe nights with the ex\u2019s are weird and I do feel like the husband is an asshole for that\nAs I read it he acknowledged her feelings and promised her to spend more time with her, nowhere did he admit to spending less time with the wife.", "Was he not this invested with his exes when you first got together with him? Before you married him? Or did you ignore it and hope it'll change after you got married?"]}
