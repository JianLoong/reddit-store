It was a personal favour and I even went for a couple of in-person courses to learn whatever was needed. \n\nI\u2019ve been helping out for 7 years now (since the relationship started) but it wasn\u2019t really in any official capacity, it was more like a filler role where I help them create emails and email banners. \n\nNow that we\u2019ve separated, I sent him all the passwords and information already but he keeps asking me to handover stuff to the next staff. This isn\u2019t rocket-science information. It is basic email creation that they could Google. I went for a course because I just wanted to do it the best I could. \n\nHowever, he keeps asking me for help. \n\nIn an email to me, my husband wrote: \u201cI have in many occasions requested you to handover all of your work to (staff). You refused citing that they are not the right fit for the job.\n\nRegardless, you assured me that moving forward you will not let our personal issues prevent you from performing the work currently handled by you.\n\nI sent you an email requesting you to have a personal handover session with (staff) to which you never replied.\n\nAre you seriously intending and hoping for the work to get disrupted or stalled out of spitefulness for me? I understand it is not reasonable or logical to ask you to do this anymore but you are doing the very thing I anticipated and wanted to prevent when I asked you to handover.\n\nCan you assist with the current requests, meet with (staff) anytime this week to handover? I will get them to come to you so it is easier for you. All I ask is for a proper handover. After that I will ensure this never troubles you again. Promise\u201d.\n\nHe also wrote in a follow-up email: \u201c(staff) updated me that you've informed her that the work has been handed over to me hence you will not be doing it. \n\nLike I said, I understand that you will not be doing it henceforth but you have not handed over yet.\n\nI will ask one final time: I will drop by your place today and can you hand over to me? I will not bother you after today for anything\u201d. \n\nI have not replied to any of these emails and even the thought of seeing him makes me feel like crying. I don\u2019t think it is fair because if he actually sat down and though about it he would realise that I did help him as a personal favour and now that our personal relationship no longer exists, I don\u2019t see a need to help him. \n\nAITA for ignoring his requests?", "created_utc": 1697516315, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179pvtv/aita_for_not_replying_to_my_soontobeexhusband/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am not required to send that same information to your staff, as that would be your responsibility. If your work has been disrupted and stalled because you have failed to do so, I suggest you look into doing so at your earliest convenience. Do not contact me about this matter further, as it was closed on (repeat the date you sent the passwords and information) when you received the passwords and information you have requested repeatedly.\"\n\nIf he continues, it becomes harassment at that point, and you should consider serving him with a cease and desist, before ramping up to pressing charges.", "NTA Do you have work anything that belongs to the company that you need to return to them? If so, do that via mail or courier.\n\nIt sounds, though, like he wants you to train people. No reason for that.", "NTA! How tf does this man own a business? \n\nHe\u2019s welcome to pay you for your time. You don\u2019t need to do that sht for free. I\u2019d have my lawyer send him a letter stating that you\u2019ve already handed over the information and that\u2019s the end. Period. He can hire someone who knows how to do it.", "NTA. You were never formally employed so the standard 2 week notice type of handover would not apply nor should it be required. Based on your post you have already handed everything over. I would tell him your not going to train his staff as that would go far above and beyond your responsibility to him and his business. I would also just reiterate that you have already handed over all relevant documents and if there is anything outstanding he needs to stop being so vague and let you know exactly what document/password it is so you can see if you still have access to it to for forwarding.", "Nta but beware of he could argue you're sabotaging his business.  Treat it like being fired. Game over any existing files but don't do anything else.  Also since you worked in that business be sure to get half the value of the business in the divorce.  You earned it.", "NTA he wants everything without paying. You worked for free for 7 years because he was your husband. Now he is not so no help for free. You gave the password, gave the info. \nYou are not going to train his employee for free. I would just answer there is no handover I don't work for you I never did or am I missing my 7 years salary ?", "NTA. Since you were never an official employee, reply that since he already has all necessary information for HIS business that you will be willing to assist as a paid consultant. This, obviously, is only if you're willing to go the route if paid. \n\nIf you're not simply reply with the fact that you handed everything off to the owner, him, and are under no obligation to train anyone else and will no longer reply to anything concerning the matter. Advise him that if the line of harassment continues, concerning work, that you will seek some sort of restraining order.", "NTA but just to be above board I would write an email to the staff/CC ex with any relevant info and make it clear to everyone they are not to contact you further.\n\nIf ex tries to get more out of you reply with 'this is my hourly consulting fee, to be paid in advance....'", "NTA. You did all the Work, for no Money and now He wants to divorce but also work your Ass for free ?!\n\nBlock him and everyone Else. Did you Tell Oir lawyer about all of that? Sue his Ass for all the Money He 'stole' from you and let the lawyer handle all the Talk \n\nGood luck", "NTA, your ex will have to figure this out for himself.", "Send him a bill for everything you've ever done for his company.

Your consulting fee is $1000 an hour for a minimum of 8 hours. Payment up front.", "INFO\n\nWhat did he mean by you refusing to give them information because that person wasn't the right fit? That sounds a lot like you just don't like how he's running the business. Did you actually do this or is he exaggerating?", "YTA but not a big asshole, a little asshole, tiny even. You mixed business and personal during your relationship. Give him the business stuff and cut all ties, it's not that hard, you gave a lot of unrelated info trying to justify not doing what you know you should. Just cut the stalling, pack up everything for him, take a picture of it email it to him and cc the staff and tell them that is everything related to the business and you consider the matter closed and you are not to be contacted again, and then give him ALL the business stuff, case closed and never look back.", "YTA. You may have worked for him as a personal favour, but you still worked for him, and frankly, it sounds like you have just emailed a few bits to him, not completing a proper handover. \n\nHe isn't asking to see you. He is asking you to meet, at your convenience, with a member of his team. That isn't unreasonable. He has also said he would stop communicating once you have done it. I wonder whether you are just stalling to maintain some kind of communication with him. Otherwise, I don't see what is stopping you from having the meeting and cutting all of your ties once and for all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

All this is, is him trying to stay connected to you.    \nNTA.", "No I don\u2019t have anything. All passwords have been emailed over. Even handed over the templates I created for email banners. They\u2019d have to log in to the banner making software I used and figure things out. But yes he wants me to \u201chandover\u201d by teaching staff how I did things.", "All passwords and files were sent over long ago. I just refuse to \u201cteach\u201d anything I learnt myself", "When that conversation happened between us, things were good. He has no tech knowledge and basically was asking me to hand over the admin access to all the emails to someone who also had little to no knowledge of this. I told him that person wasn\u2019t qualified and ask that he find someone a bit more adequate for me to pass the info on to. \n\nWhat I was helping with were the handling of gsuite - creating emails and email banners. I also had access to all staff\u2019s passwords as I had to reset passwords where and when necessary.", "He wants her to train his employee, no way. She was helping him because she was in a relation ship so of course it's mixed as he did when he let her work for free. \nNow they aren't in a relationship, she gave all the password and info via an e mail template(read her answer) so no she does not have to train his employee.", "So, how do you meet up with someone although seeing them? He is explicitly asking to see her, and she handed over all passwords and templates to him over email already, so there is nothing for her to hand over other than her active knowledge of how to use the software. You wouldn\u2019t go in and teach your replacement to use Canva, Excel, or employer specific programs after you leave a job, right? That\u2019s something you either learn before you get the job that needs you to use it, or you learn it from your employer. You don\u2019t learn from the employee who no longer works there.", "Too bad for him. Shoot him an email that clarifies that you have no work product to hand over. You\u2019ve provided all passwords and templates for the company. You have nothing else to hand over.", "Lol no. 10000% NTA. I\u2019d block him.", "You can always teach them as a consultant at $200 / HR.", "That makes no sense. It sounds like you were okay with passing things on, but felt you had control over who got it, but then decided you just weren't going to do anything out of... spite? Like he suggested? Maybe? Not that you'd be wrong for that, but it does seem a bit odd to not just give the info to the first person he recommended. You mention that they should be able to learn just like you did, but you seem to think that person wouldn't be able to learn. You also said you gave him everything, but now he's coming over to get everything? Which is it? Was he lying?", "I refuse to admit you're right because my gender wont allow it.  However I'll say that after rereading the emails a couple of times I may be less correct than I originally thought. I'm an old construction guy and I revert back to a very physical tactile state and I kept rationalizing the hand over as a physical thing, something that was withheld and should just be turned over and all ties cut.", "The email is to cover herself in case he tries to use this as leverage in their divorce proceedings.", "So when I was telling him that I didn\u2019t want to pass it to another staff, that was when things were good between me and my ex-husband. The woman he wanted to entrust with access to all of the emails and passwords was not suitable and I told him that, which he agreed. \n\nNow however, I sent over my all of the passwords and accounts to my ex-husband itself. I also even told them the software I used to create the email banners and even set the software to change the admin to him. \n\nBy him coming over I think he wants me to teach them how I created the banners? I am not sure what exactly. In any case, I am not going to teach them anything.", "You are significantly less correct than you thought. I\u2019ll explain it in words an old construction worker should understand. OP was a construction worker using keys and tools provided by her ex\u2019s company. When she stopped working for him, she gave him back the keys and tools, but didn\u2019t teach his new staff how to use the tools she was using before she left. He is now harassing an ex-employee for not teaching his staff how to to the job that he (the business owner) didn\u2019t teach his staff to do. He considers the ability to use the tools to complete job functions as HIS property, and is demanding that his former employee basically teach his new employee how to hammer a nail or to tighten a screw without stripping it.", "Now it all makes sense. Yeah, you should tell him that he is not welcome. You've given him all he needs to sort it out, and that you aren't his employee. Mind you, you might want to consider taking on a consultant roll and have him pay you $5,000 to teach anyone other than him how to do the job, with the stipulation that he pay you first and that you will only cover that one person he chooses, and then walk away with an extra $5,000 after a few hours work."]}
