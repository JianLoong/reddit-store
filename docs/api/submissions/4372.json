This has to do with me and a guy who I'll be calling Max (19M).\n\nFor some context, I've had problems with Max before. We both go to uni together and are in the same department and run in the same friend group. He always wants to be around me and calls me a lot. I don't answer a fair amount of the time but then he texts me multiple times and starts calling my other friends to \"check on me\" if I don't respond. I've told him multiple times to back off and that he isn't my boyfriend and I don't want him to be. I'm never alone with him, I always turn him down or turn all our outings into group ones so I won't be alone with him.\n\nEarlier this month he asked me out. I turned him down. And now for the past week or so, he's been trying to get me alone to talk to me and give him a chance. I've refused and don't feel comfortable being with him by myself. I've told him multiple times to give me space and that while I don't mind being in the same friend group, I'm not willing to be anything more with him nor do I feel comfortable being with him alone. Ever since he's been texting me and calling me constantly. Others have added on to it saying that I've been leading him on and I should just give him a chance.\n\nToday I finally snapped and told him to fuck off and leave me alone, I'm not interested and never will be and now I'm thankful I turned him down if this is how he treats me. I also, admittedly, called him a few choice words. However, a lot of our mutual friends among others have been telling me that I was a bitch, I could have given him a chance, and that I was too harsh on him. Several others have told me that I made several low blows (I, myself, am confused on the low blows part) and was overall way too mean to him. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Firstly, thank you to everyone who has commented thus far. I'm going to be going through and reading all the comments. And thank you, especially, for the validation. I thought I was going crazy with the way everyone was treating me and began to believe that I was in the wrong. Also, in case it wasn't clear, I did use fake names. \n\nJust to address some things: First, I am a STEM major and most of my (old) friends are in the same major meaning that they are mostly men. That may explain some of their behaviour.\n\nAs an update: I bought pepper spray and a taser that I'll be carrying around from now on. I'll also be going to campus security first thing Monday morning to make a report as it is closed for the weekend now. I am now keeping record of everything and documenting all communication I have with him. I've also decided to leave my old friend group for a new one as I no longer feel safe. A lot of people here helped to really put things into perspective for me in how dangerous this situation is and I'm very grateful for that.", "created_utc": 1670627754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhc0lk/aita_for_telling_a_guy_to_f_off_after_he_wouldnt/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I recommend getting any form of self-defense object if you can. gun, taser, pepper spray, ETC, And If you can't get anything. Just remember to kick him in the nuts as hard as possible if he puts his hands on you.", "NTA Always trust your gut feelings about someone.

If this is the case, him and your so called \"friends\" are gas lighting you telling you you have been \"leading him on\" and should give him a chance. They are making you think this is your fault, and you have been doing things you have clearly stated here you have NOT been doing (ie. lading him on).\n\nThis whole situation is beyond messed up.

Did you ask your friend group why they\u2019re allowing him to ignore you saying no? Did you ask your friend group why they\u2019re supporting someone who is harassing and borderline stalking you?\n\nHim trying to get you alone is scary, in my opinion. He\u2019s likely trying to isolate you and intimidate you. You\u2019ve told him no and asked him to leave you alone multiple times and he\u2019s showing you that he doesn\u2019t care if you say no. \n\nHe won\u2019t listen to no.\n\nIt\u2019s time to report him for harassment to whomever you report that stuff to, if you can. I\u2019d also lock my door, get some self-defense items set up, and maybe you can have a way to call 911 fast.\n\nThis is bright red flag territory. And very possibly dangerous. Do not downplay the fact that you might be in danger from this boy.\n\nAlso, why is your friend group okay with this behavior to the extent they\u2019re sticking up for and verbally abusing you over someone who can\u2019t listen to \u201cno\u201d? \n\nTell them it\u2019s 2022 and no means fucking no.", "NTA dude wouldn\u2019t get the hint", "NTA\n\nNo means no. No is a complete sentence. You made it clear several times and it\u2019s time for some new friends. If your friends think he deserves a chance then they can date him.

He\u2019ll get the hint or you\u2019ll need to get the cops involved.", "NTA The fact your supposed friends are defending Max who can't seem to take a hint. Makes me think you need to find some better people to call friends.", "NTA.\n\nKeep records of all your communication with him and look into getting a restraining order (I admittedly don't know if you can get one unless he's tried to harm you, or if harassment is enough). People like this can be dangerous. Personally, I would ditch any friend that called you an AH because in my experience they will enable his behavior.", "NTA, get new friends.", "NTA. You have every right to choose who you want to date or spend time with. He has not respected your opinion because - as is with a lot of men - his views and opinions are more important than yours, in his eyes.\n\nHe pushed you until you snapped and you had every right to do so after you repeatedly made it clear. Once you tell him once it can be lawfully considered harassment in some countries, though I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to take it that far and in my country, like many others I\u2019m sure the cops might not do a whole lot (lame).\n\nYour safety is the most important thing and you have every right to tell him to fuck off.

When would people learn to except a simple No.", "NTA- To those that say \"you didn't have to say it like that\"... Yes, Yes I fucking did. I gave polite responses several times. Not only were my polite responses ignored, he became more aggressive in his pursuit. If you want to date him, you date him.

To be clear, stopped by making reports to the appropriate authorities. If your school doesn't take it seriously, go to local police. Document everything thing with date, time place, witnesses. As other posters said, carry mace pepper spray or a whistle. Make sure it's legal in your area. \n\nGood luck and stay safe. I can also be dmed if you like."]}
