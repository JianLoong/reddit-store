You can have golden retrievers that are complete assholes and a Rottweiler Doberman or pitbull that is just the sweetest thing you\u2019ve ever met. \n\nHumans who own pitbulls unfortunately have to work harder with their dogs to be better behaved because of the stigma similar I am sure to those who own Rottweilers, Dobermans, Belgian Malinois\u2019s etc", "Pitbulls aren't anywhere near the top in terms of bite force. Mastiffs, Rottweilers, Bulldogs, Cane Corsos, Akitas and a handful of other lesser known breeds (at least tend to be lesser known among Americans) have higher bite forces than pitbulls. The ones at the top have more than DOUBLE the bite force of pits. But no one goes around saying they are extremely dangerous, people shouldn't own them and they should be banned, etc. Do they require extra insurance to own? Other than rottweilers sometimes, no. Are they banned from being owned in entire cities? Nope.\n\nAre these breeds good for new dog owners? Hell no. But if is a newbie has one of these breeds people just shake their heads and say the dog is going to be a handful and might not have been the best choice. They don't say, \"OMG what the hell are you doing?? Are you fucking crazy?? You have kids! That's extremely reckless and you've put your kids in grave danger.\"\n\nDo these breeds HAVE to have more and more extensive training than other breeds? Yes. Do most owners invest the time and energy required for that? Very rarely. Again, more suitable for owners who have had multiple dogs previously. Does ANYONE claim these breeds are inheritantly dangerous?? No. Just that they would do better with someone who has experience and will put in the training time. The same is true of Pitbulls.", "Any kind of job an extremely intelligent breed can do. Extremely intelligent, high drive dogs with lots of endurance are working dogs. They need a job to keep their brains and bodies healthy. \n\nI\u2019ve seen them work as service dogs because they are extremely intelligent, have great stability and are strong enough to provide mobility. In the past they have been used for guid or guard dogs even herding or hunting.\n\nWe might not think of them as traditional working dogs but their traits make them a perfect candidate for the category and by treating and training them as such we would avoid many more issues because we wouldn\u2019t have these very intense dogs being under exercised and under stimulated mentally", "Unless you breed your specific dog with traits you have absolutely no way of knowing it\u2019s temperament. \n\nMy dog was dog aggressive when I got him. He HATED other dogs. For years I\u2019ve worked with him to be able to be around other dogs, to be in spaces with other dogs and be able to function at that level. However, if I put my dog in a situation to fail, he will. That\u2019s on me as his owner to keep him safe.\n\nYou are assuming something about an entire group of dogs, comprised of multiple breeds, most of whom no longer have a connection to the same group of dogs who were bred for fighting or to be dog aggressive. Basset Hounds were hunting dogs used to after game and rabbits but when was the last time you saw one that was anything more than a very cute couch potato? Dog breeds evolve and temperaments and traits change with breeding and time", "You mean the terrier mixes that look suspiciously like pits. \ud83d\ude02 Oh, you know it's a terrier, but can't tell the other breed that it may be mixed with, when it looks like a full on pitbull.", "Again, they are more likely to bite or attack.. but the pitbull leads the way in fatalities. Smaller dogs are far less likely to kill. I mean that makes sense logically. There are reasons that you see more stories of pits killing kids.. more of them are killing kids. A dog biting someone and getting stitches isn't a big story for the news.", "This is the same kind of idiotic argument pit owners try to pull when they say chihuahuas are more \"dangerous\" because they bite more often\n\nIf I had to choose, I'd rather be bitten by a chihuahua than [mauled and eaten by a pitbull like that baby and toddler in tennessee were](https://nypost.com/2022/10/07/tennessee-mom-kirstie-jane-bennard-hospitalized-after-her-2-kids-killed-in-pit-bull-attack/)", "There is a difference between an aggressive dog that bites and an aggressive dog that maims and kills. Obviously we would prefer if the animals we bring around our children are not aggressive in any sense, but let's please not delude ourselves into thinking that cocker spaniels pose a greater safety risk to young children than pit bulls.", "People in the pet rescue biz know about Wheatons. I do not recommend them to people", "A West Highland terrier mauled me as a child. Family pet, parents right bedside me, he came running at me and was gnawing on my head. I know big dogs do damage, but I've been bitten by a Chihuahua and a Yorkie as an adult.\n\nUntrained dogs are a menace.", "Chihuahuas are a menace. I used to visit a friend when I was a kid and EVERY SINGLE DAMN TIME one of her mothers chihuahuas latched onto my achilles tendon until I shook him off. Bastard dog.", "Exactly.", "You genuinely think you can train dog aggression out of a pitbull? Like what \u201cwork\u201d are you referring to when you call it a working breed?", "How is it not obvious?  An American pit bull terrier weighs 40-60 pounds and has large jaws with a bite of 250-330 PSI.\n\nA Chihuahua weighs 4-6 pounds with a bite of 100-180 PSI (and much tinier jaws).\n\nYou gonna tell me that a 1,700 lb draft horse is not inherently more dangerous than a 200 lb mini horse next?\n\nI invite you to be stepped on or backed into a stall corner by a butt-shove by both types of horse to believe that the physical differences also mean inherent risk differences in every interaction with people.", "Idk why you\u2019re getting downvoted, you\u2019re 100% correct in your replies. People on Reddit just hate pits no matter what info they are presented with.  Know there is somebody out there who agrees with you because you are correct :)", "As someone who has worked closely with shepherds and pit bulls, I'm not sure I'd categorize the latter as \"extremely intelligent\" or suitable for any of the jobs I'd need them to don a farm, but okay.", "Pitbulls are a type of terrier. The full breed name is American Pit Bull Terrier. Shelters do mislabel dogs but calling a pit a terrier mix is not inaccurate.", "Yes. With the right environment, training and breeding. If the dog lives in a prey free environment, along with the ability to wear them out, it\u2019s possible. Especially if you get a pit as a puppy. Its different if you get an older dog with a history of biting and aggression.. but there are factors. A dog with an established history of aggression will not make a good family pet. A pit with terrible breeding prob shouldn\u2019t be a family pet. As someone else said, a pit, or any high energy dog, is NOT for beginners.", "Pitbulls are not born to just be aggressive. The aggression that made them good fighting dogs was all because of the owner pushing them to be that way. \n\nAnd yes, you can work on dog reactivity or aggression with ANY DOG. My own dog was dog aggressive or reactive when we got him and it took a lot of work but we were able to improve it leaps and bounds. It\u2019s still on me, as the owner, not to put my dog in a situation where I know my dog will fail and be pushed to snapping point. My dog is an English Spaniel and Duck Trolling Retriever Mix. \n\nHe isn\u2019t a bad dog because of his dog aggression or reactivity.\n\nA working dog is a dog used to perform any practical task. Pitbulls are highly intelligent and have tons of energy like a lot of other working breeds they need a job. I have a friend who\u2019s Pitbull is a hunting dog. I have another whose Pitbull is a service dog.", "And German Shepards, Husky\u2019s, Chow Chows and more all have a similar bite force. \n\nIf you have a big dog, you has its owner need to be responsible. A dog is going to react if pushed to snapping point. By the time they bite they have given many signs that they are being pushed to far. That\u2019s not on the dog", "Thank you!", "It may not be inaccurate, but it sounds like it might be misleading?", "Key word: BREEDING. Shelters are full of pits from backyard breeders. Irresponsible backyard breeding of these dogs is rampant. Getting a pit from a shelter, as people are increasingly encouraged to do to be altruistic, is like playing Russian roulette.", "I\u2019ve seen the fake Amazon vest pit service dogs that pull on the leash and go nuts when another dog passes by, yep. I\u2019m extremely curious to know how one works as a hunting dog, and why a hunter would choose one over a dog that\u2019s been selectively bred as a hunting dog, like a soft-mouthed golden retriever.", "> And German Shepards, Husky\u2019s, Chow Chows and more all have a similar bite force.\n\nI never said they didn\u2019t?  I said that pit bulls were, of course, more dangerous than some other dog breeds.  Not All other dog breeds.\n\nPart of it is the physical factors I mentioned in my original comment, part is large scale irresponsible and unprofessional breeding without considering pet quality temperament, and part their owner\u2019s (lack of) proper training.  That\u2019s all combined into reasons why the pit bull cohort accounted for 2/3 of dog bite fatalities in the US, and about 1/5 of all dog bites.\n\nAnd no, not all dogs \u201cgive many signs\u201d before biting.  Many do, sure, it\u2019s what makes it possible to keep them as pets.  But you can\u2019t rely on your dog giving six people-perceptible warnings before taking a chunk out of your toddler or Annoying Uncle Earl.  If every dog did that, pretty much the only bite fatalities would be the under-2 year olds and the severely intoxicated.  And there\u2019d be a lot fewer bites in the US annually instead of about 800,000 bites bad enough to need medical attention."]}
