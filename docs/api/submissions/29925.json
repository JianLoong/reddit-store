But not especially dangerous from a chihuahua. (I've also met well behaved chihuahuas - my aunt had a pair, for instance. But they are more often not trained or not trained well.)", "Where are you getting this bs info? Less than 50 people a year die from dogs in all of America. It's actually highly unlikely. Dog bites occur frequently but actual death from dogs is very low.", "Bad behavior is not the issue. It\u2019s the capability to kill", "Now look at just bites. Vast majority are from small breeds", "I have had golden retriever, beagle, shitzus, wiener, all loving and great with kids and people. It is always the dog who draws the defective human who is blamed. I personally think the bad owner should be euthanized", "i think the issue with chihuahuas is that they\u2019re almost never properly socialized or trained and their boundaries are rarely respected. people think because they\u2019re small that it\u2019s okay for them to be aggressive or that they don\u2019t need to be trained. they are very high energy dogs with a moderate prey drive and in my experience, i\u2019ve never met a single chihuahua that was trained, socialized and given enough exercise and enrichment. most of the owners just want a little purse sized dog.", "Our lab/pit mix was attacked by a Chihuahua and was bitten at least 10 times (didn't break the skin). She just sat there staring at the Chihuahua the whole time like, \"You have got to be out of your damn mind.\" I just can't stand chihuahuas.", "Chihuahua is an ancient Incan word meaning \"50% Tremble - 50% Murder\"", "As a child, I once lived in a neighborhood that had a roving pack of stray chihuahuas. There were multiple instances of them mauling unattended toddlers/young kids. They'd just converge like a swarm on whatever poor kid happened to catch their attention. Absolute menaces.", "Quite. Also I can defend myself against a chihuahua pretty easily. A pit bull, not so much.", "Yep, and we have people here in this thread saying that it\u2019s always the owners fault when a dog attacks. The Bennards had those pit bulls for 8 years and I\u2019m sure they loved and cared for them.", "In the description of the American Pitbull Terrier from the UKC: This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.\"\n\nIf you are going to use the generalization for the breed to judge all the dogs in it than yes, they are generalized as being highly intelligent and having a willingness to work", "I'm not promoting Pitbulls nor do I think everybody should have one. If you HAD read the rest of my comment, I said ALL of these dog breeds should not be with people who have never owned a dog before. They need owners with years of experience, who are willing to put in the time and effort needed to train such breeds. I just hate the demonization of Pitbulls and the insistence thay they are inheritantly more dangerous than other breeds.", "It\u2019s always the human that is defective. Just as some are failures as parents some are failures as dog parents.", "Not the point. Not a good defense. Deaths is the problem.", "Any idiot can look at that terrier mix and know it's a pit. The fact they don't label it as such should be criminal.", "My in laws had a non-standard large chihuahua who was the lowest energy dog I\u2019ve ever met. Granted I knew her in later life, but she was almost cat like. Would lie along humans\u2019 legs on the couch, and was trained to use a pee pad because she was afraid of the outside (the one thing that they couldn\u2019t get her comfortable with). She made me realize that I didn\u2019t dislike all small dogs (although she was larger than my cats), just poorly trained ones", "\ud83e\udd23 Truth!", "Pits are not good for any level and definitely not for a family pet."]}
