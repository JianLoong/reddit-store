What the actual fuck? Maybe old lady didn\u2019t mean to be racist, but you just educated her with a quickness. I feel like if you\u2019re rude enough to touch a COMPLETE STRANGER, you can\u2019t cry if you a sharp reaction. She\u2019s lucky she didn\u2019t get hands. Damn.", "NTA by any stretch. \n\nThe sooner these people start leaving these interactions in tears, the sooner they stop doing it.", "NTA\n\nI've got really long very straight hair that I often wear up in two pig tails to keep it off my face.  I've had strangers walk up behind me and grab my hair like reigns.  Anyone touching my head unexpectedly makes me see fucking red!", "Pfft. You should be more understanding?! NTA! That\u2019s outrageous. Glad you said your piece. She will think twice about touching hopefully anyone ever again!", "NTA. Sometimes being strongly confronted with the social consequences of one\u2019s thoughts/behaviour is a catalyst for deep, needed change. I hope that this woman processes her tears in the context of what she can think/do differently from now on. Source: my own experiences with being corrected strongly and publicly.", "Of course your white dad and husband aren\u2019t on your side. NTA", "NTA\n\nThis lady had no excuse. At 60, you're old enough to know that you don't touch a stranger without asking.  \nWhat the hell ? It's something children are taught from an early age.", "I'm white and I'm appalled at her behavior. NTA", "NTA.\n\nWhite woman here with curly hair. The fucking audacity of people out here trying to touch our hair is sickening. Yeah, it's curly. Do I look like a labradoodle? No. Fuck off, you're in my bubble. I've found curly hair and women being pregnant all of a sudden become objects and we lose all autonomy.", "NTA.\n\nI'm a white man, 55, and know what curly hair and dreads feels like.\nWant to guess how I know ? Because I ASKED people if it was okay to touch it.\n\nEdit : just like a pregnant woman's belly, I think it's normal to be curious, but common courtesy to not just start groping.\n\nIf I were with you, and she had big breasts I would ask her if it was okay for me to grab her there without asking....\nI've never been with someone larger than a C cup.", "NTW who TF likes being touched by strangers?? If you haven\u2019t gotten the memo about touching others hair by now then you having been paying attention.", "NTA. You probably could have been nicer, but honestly, she doesn\u2019t seem to have deserved any kindness. We reach pre schoolers to keep their hands to themselves\u2026 someone older than 6 should definitely know better, let alone someone who could have a grandkid that\u2019s 6.", "NTA. Maybe she finally learned something most of us were taught in kindergarten: don't touch others without asking first. Good grief.", "NTA frankly the audacity of that woman", "NTA, I\u2019m white but have extremely curly hair and often deal with people wanting to touch it, this is invasive and uncomfortable and you are not in the wrong for defending your boundaries and personal space. We\u2019re still reeling from a pandemic, it is ok to have a reaction to someone touching you without consent. Could you have been gentler with your approach? Maybe but I still don\u2019t think this makes you TA", "No one has a right to put their hand on you , whether they mean harm or not. One way to get more than some verbal , you don\u2019t know anyone\u2019s intent. NTA", "I like your energy. NTA. Strangers don\u2019t come up and feel your hair. She can ask if she is curious and then you can decide what to do.", "NTA\n\nThere is no part of a STRANGER someone should be touching without consent. I find it really uncomfortable that she just reaches out and touched your hair. She would likely never reach out and touch a stranger anywhere else, so why should hair be an exception?", "ESH because yea it\u2019s a toddler move. But by reacting in so much anger it\u2019s not likely she\u2019d even ask anyone just get sad n feel shitty. You didn\u2019t teach her to ask, you taught her to fear you. When people lack such impulse control like that it\u2019s usually for a reason, and that can be said of you and her. After all you do make it sound like you took out your day on her. Which is wrong.", "The other lady was in the wrong and you were entitled to be cross with her.\n\nBut my way of thinking is that sometimes it just isn't worth the stress.  As it happened, you reduced another person to tears, caused a comotion in the store, and it sounds like you left without buying what you wanted?  It also caused multiple conversations and disagreements with your husband and parents.\n\nThe alternative would have been to say nothing, or at least been very polite while telling the older lady off, and there would have been no tears, no disagreements and you'd have the items you wanted from the store.\n\nEven though I think you were entitled to react the way you did, I just don't see it as being worth it.", "YTA \n\nYou should be nicer to disabled people.  Lets face it, no sane person touches strangers hair like that, so the lady obviously has something going on, but you just could not wait to yell and make a scene out of it.  You should have known better.", "NTA, you were MILD in your response. You do not have to be understanding to someone who treats you as an object. \n\nWe teach *toddlers* not to touch people without asking.\n\nAlso, isn't that technically assault? She's lucky she just got yelled at.", "NTA. You were right to yell at her - bet she won't try that specific trick again! And I love the petting zoo comment, that was lovely!!! If it isn't part of your own body, you don't freaking touch it! I mean, damn.", "NTA. Sure, you could have been kinder. But letting people get away with that kind of behavior is the reason we still see them behave that way to this day. I\u2019m a white woman and I wouldn\u2019t dream of touching anyone\u2019s hair (or pregnant stomach, or arm, etc.). She was out of line.", "NTA\nI kinda understand her wanting to touch. I love feeling textures and will often walk across a store to touch a fabric it whatever just to satisfy that desire/compulsion. But touching your hair (or anything on a person) without consent is like an intrusive thought, we don't do then out loud. Fight the thought.", "NTA. She touched you without your consent. You don't owe any politeness to someone who assaulted you (which is what unwanted physical contact is under many laws).", "NTA\n\nYour hair isn't public property.  Touching someone's hair like that is a really weird thing to do but if she really wants to then she should ask first.", "NTA. You should never touch another person without their consent for ANY reason.", "NTA. You owe nobody anything. It\u2019s like those weirdos who think that a pregnant woman should tolerate being stroked because \\*BABY\\*.\n\nYuck, no. Keep your hands to yourself, creep.", "ESH. Her behaviour was horrible. She should absolutely be called out for it but you sound like you were quite aggressive.", "NTA\u2026. Although you could\u2019ve been just a wee bit more tactful :) but it\u2019s okay, no judgement from my end", "Esh. \n\nWhile it is your body, hair and personal space, you could\u2019ve calmly and nicely told her you didn\u2019t want to be touched. Now if she would\u2019ve refused to listen the first time then that\u2019s when you would\u2019ve had the right to go off on her.", "If a child had done that it would be understandable a whole grown woman should know better. Extra points for making her cry.  NTA", "NTA. Your husband & dad are white. Of course they don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d why you were upset", "[removed]", "NTA - I honestly don't understand why anyone would touch someone else's hair!  It is such an odd and invasive thing to do.", "Nta wtf don\u2019t fucking touch strangers. She deserves to cry, she 100% wouldn\u2019t have done this to a white woman.", "NTA, people need to keep their hands to themselves.  You never touch anyone without prior consent.", "NTA\n\nYou do not owe understanding to someone touching you without your consent.\n\nHer crying is absolutely ridiculous. She touched you - how dare she get upset. \n\nI wonder if your dad & husband would have had the same response if she didn\u2019t cry.", "NTA. And ignore any comments that say \"you should have been nicer\" You don't owe this person any kindness whatsoever.", "ESH idk what it is with some white people wanting to touch black peoples hair - like just don\u2019t ffs.\n\nDidn\u2019t have to absolutely rag on her lol but Tbf probably traumatized her from ever doing it again at least", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
