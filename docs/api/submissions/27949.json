As you clearly are as well.", "Thank you from another Generation Xr.. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Without Boomers... there would be no Millennials, right?", "OPs point about how it actually seems like more people are aware not to pet a dog without asking than they are aware you shouldn\u2019t touch a human without asking is 3rd eye wide open tbh because she\u2019s so right. \n\nBut also it\u2019s really bonkers that she\u2019s right because how did so many people end up with the mindset that as soon as someone has something slightly different from what they usually see about them it\u2019s open season to start treating a human like an interactive exhibit at the science museum. \n\nMaybe if there was more of a chance that touching someone could lead to them biting you like a reactive dog then this would be less of an issue.", "This is exactly what I thought of. At least pregnancy is temporary. Your hair is literally YOUR hair.", "That and new borns like they won't get their ass beat", "I have two huge tattoos on my forearm and the only person who has ever touched them was my niece at her first birthday when she \"picked\" part of one off and handed it to me (not sure what she thought it was but it was so damn cute). If a random stranger tried touching them I'd probably end up in jail.", "Omg I have a large tattoo on my back and when I'm standing in a line, sometimes I'll feel someone start literally stroking my back. Like what in the world?!?!?! How is that OK?", "Yes! I have a tattoo on the back of my neck and I have had more than one person (male/female/young/old) pull down the collar of my shirt to get a better look. When I spin around and look at them like they have clearly lost their mind, they just shrug it off like, \"I just wanted to see your tattoo.\" Like who even does that?!?", "I hated when people (strangers) would touch my baby bump when I was pregnant\u2026 it\u2019s so odd and off putting\u2026", "My tattoos aren\u2019t super big or colorful so I haven\u2019t hit that particular issue yet. The only unusual thing about me someone could touch for no reason is the lupus butterfly rash on my face and that would actually ruin my life if that happened", "Oh now that I think about it I only have like wavy/slight curls hair pattern but even then when someone tries to genuinely pull their fingers through my hair it gets caught and yanks, and OP said they felt tugging, so this person didn\u2019t just pet her she tangled her fingers in her hair. God I\u2019m picturing someone with rings doing that and it makes my skin crawl.", "To be fair there\u2019s literally no indication that the woman has early onset dementia or any kind of cognitive issue. Like unless it\u2019s in extremely early stages she would probably have some sort of caregiver with her.\n Even when my brain was so inflamed from lupus I frequently didn\u2019t understand where I was while inside my own apartment and couldn\u2019t always remember how to use words I still knew to keep my hands to myself. \nI\u2019ve had a lot of patients who actually do have dementia and know to keep their hands to themselves. \n\nSo like even if she had extremely mild early stages of early onset dementia I feel like you have to be at the level where your personality has started to undergo serious changes before I\u2019m like eh yeah that checks out. If you\u2019re just having cognitive and memory issues you\u2019ll usually retain your knowledge of what stuff is considered super inappropriate.", "The word nice literally means to be agreeable. False. I am not agreeable. Pleasant maybe but not agreeable for the sake of someone else\u2019s feelings. The feelings of others are their issue. Perhaps that woman wouldn\u2019t be tearful had she been nicer and kept her hands to herself. Definitely NTA Op", "I wasn\u2019t saying it didn\u2019t happen- I said I\u2019ve never seen it. I can only speak to my personal experiences and what I\u2019ve witnessed. I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.

That\u2019s so weird to me. I\u2019ve never felt the urge to touch a stranger\u2019s hair in my life. My mind is bottled right now.", " I used to have long,very blonde hair. I used to get pet by black women at church.  I thought it was very strange, because they're well aware how upsetting it could be.  Rude people are going to be rude.", "People don't realize it can be racist and happen to other people too. It's not an either or situation.", "My sister and I are white, trust me if she could have straightened her hair when she was young, and afraid of seeming rude to strangers, she would have. Just not possible with her curls. Wasn't until she an adult that she starting calling people on it. I know it was a fraction of what WOC deal with so it's disappointing that OP's family don't have her back.", "Another curly haired woman here, who has experienced strangers touching (yanking) her hair. The 60 year old was totally out of line.", "I work with a WOC and we\u2019ve had people grab her hair on scenes because they wanted to touch it - I\u2019m white with curly hair but they beeline for her locs. I\u2019ve chewed so many people out on her behalf; it\u2019s ridiculous how people think non-straight hair is a petting zoo.", "I'm afghan and I've only had WOC touching my hair or ask to touch my hair like an immature child. White girls otoh were always polite when asking and that pretty much stopped after high school.", "Yeah I started straightening my hair at 12 . I got bullied so hard for having big poofy curly hair . \nLike the kids would call me nappy roots and play with it and it would get horribly tangled . Then one day my sister surprised me with a hair straightener . I have burned most of the poof from my hair lol", "I have natural Shirley Temple hair: five or six giant corkscrews if I let it air dry. I don't exist on any curl chart. People like to pull on my hair, too - apparently it \"must be fake\" or \"take a long time\".", "My mom's hair is curly too. She used to have long hair, but while spectating a football game years ago, it was really humid that day and her hair went into ringlets. \n\nA big, drunk guy was sitting behind her, and started tugging on her curls to watch them bounce. She didn't want to say anything, because she didn't know how he would react, so she waited until he passed out -\n\nand then went and cut it short a few days later. She's had short hair since.", "As a mixed-Indigenous woman with very long, straight hair it still happens. A lot. The amount of people who feel entitled to touch my hair is unreal.", "It could have also been someone younger with mental illness. Age isn't a factor. No touching people. If you have any reason you can't do this you should not be unattended.", "I didn\u2019t say anything about the excuses people make.\n\nI said 60 is not elderly, and entitlement has nothing to do with age.", "It used to be very very common to have literal human zoos and traveling freak shows where it was normal and encouraged to gawk at human beings that looked different at all. I think it\u2019s a lingering cultural undertone from those times. Those times weren\u2019t really that long ago. \nA \"Congolese village\" was displayed at the Brussels 1958 World's Fair and \"African Village\" was opened in Augsburg's zoo in Germany in July 2005.", "There are plenty of people who think nothing of walking up and petting a dog they don't know. It's insanity.", "It\u2019s called racism and yt supremacist culture.", "I used to have my nails done really elaborately and people often would grab my hand to look at them more closely without asking. When my awesome friend and pro nail artist moved away, I stopped getting them done. I do not miss being touched.", "Someone at a concert literally moved part of my clothing aside so they could see my tattoo better. It was very unpleasant. The only time I didn't mind was when I worked at a daycare and one of the littles became fascinated with the ones on my wrists. When babies do it it's cute, when anyone who should know better does it it's creepy.", "It is very odd to touch strangers without even asking.  Not that asking wouldn't also be rude but you'd think adults would know better.", "It happens to black women and WOC far more often and I'm so sorry about that.", "exactly. that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to say, thank you", "Sorry, I think I worded that poorly. My \u201cit can be\u201d was about loss of decorum being a symptom of dementia in general, not that it\u2019s age related or that  the old lady had any reason to be touching OP period. \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Or someone without mental illness who happens to be inconsiderate of other people.

And in those instances it was just part of their personality even if I didn\u2019t like it they weren\u2019t being malicious . I just think it depends . Like if I had told them I hate that and they kept doing it then I\u2019d think they were being assholes", "It's not an age thing but a generational thing and you can not argue that. People who were born in the 60s had very different views on bodily autonomy, racism, boundaries and most other social conventions. That's just facts. They also didn't have resources like today on or interest in bettering yourself so most older people are stuck in their ways since they were young. This should explain it without pissing anyone of or assuming we're ageist towards the elderly.", "Then why are you ignoring the person your replying to\u2019s actual point and claiming they\u2019re just saying old people are entitled?", " I had a similar experience with a older Latina woman so idk if it's culture unless that culture is everywhere which it could be I guess", "I was standing in a Tim Horton's one time with a coworker.  This man came up to me and starts going on about the tattoo on my arm and then strokes my arm.  I just totally froze with a weird smile on my face.  After he went away, my coworker was like, omg, he just started touching you!  I can't believe he did that.  Then was telling everyone about it when we got back to work because she couldn't believe it (we're both women).    \n\n\nAnother time, I was in a cafe with another female friend and some guy actually touched the tattoo on her thigh.  She is loud and will speak her mind so she did not freeze and smile weirdly like I did.  But like, what the hell?  I don't get it and it's pretty intimidating when you're a woman and some strange man comes over and starts touching you.  \n\n\nI truly can't imagine what it must be like for Black women to have this happen.  I don't understand how people become adults and never learn that it's not OK to just start touching a stranger's body parts, be it hair or skin."]}
