This was her third accident and second car totaled within a year, with 2/3 involving her driving while inebriated. This has been an ongoing issue for three years and has had a huge impact on my family. Since October, I \\[18F\\] have gone on mental health withdrawal from university, gotten a part-time job, and have been saving my paychecks to go towards a down payment on my first car. My mom came home last month after staying out of state with family for two months. Even when she was there, her family wouldn't let her drive their vehicles. She's been trying to get sober since October.  \nWhile I was saving up, my dad \\[55M\\] warned me that mom was going to ask if she could drive my (currently hypothetical) car. He said it was up to me whether or not I'd let her, but advised against it. A few days after, she asked me out of nowhere. I caved and said yes, because I felt bad for her. She said she was afraid of forgetting how to drive. She also told me she'd only use it for errands and doctor's appointments, but I said I had to be in the vehicle while she was driving. I don't know why I said yes at the time. I think it's mostly because:\n\n1. She's my mom.\n2. It sucks not having a vehicle, especially where we live. At least speaking from personal experience. There's okay bus service, but schedules can be spotty and the buses themselves can get sketchy.\n3. She's just really sad and I think being able to leave the house would be good for her. She has problems, and I feel like being inside all the time makes it worse. She still didn't get out much when she had a car, but I think having some kind of option would be good for her.\n\nBut again, I'm hesitant because she's still taking some kind of pills that make her pretty dazed.

I understand that getting sober is difficult, and I feel like a dick for even doubting her progress a little, but this isn't the first time she's promised to get better.  \nA few days ago I asked my dad if there was any kind of car she wouldn't drive. He told me she'd drive anything but a manual. Since then I've been considering getting one so she wouldn't drive it. But I already told her I'd let her drive my car, and if I bought a manual I'd be going back on my word. It's shitty promising someone something, then backpedaling on it. Still, given the entire situation here, I'm afraid it might be for best.

From his teens to his 80s, had his license taken away countless times, AA, jail, fines, vehicles impounded, lost jobs, ruined relationships.
