My mom was only a few years older than me when she died of breast cancer.  I was absolutely terrified I was going to end up dead at 40 like my mom.   \n\nI completely understand not having anyone to talk to about it.

I told my husband I don\u2019t want to be treated like I\u2019m sick, I just want life to be as normal as possible.

I would have them anywhere between 10 and 20 times a day.  I had to fight to not drive my car head on into a Mack truck or off a bridge.  Once I got to that point, I turned my car around, drove to my oncologist and said we have something different or you will have to place me in a psych ward because I\u2019m a danger to myself on these medications.   I would rather do chemo a million times over than feel the way I did on those medications for even 10 seconds.  I tell you this not to scare you but warn you to watch out for these side effects because they can be horrible.

Aunt might catch a bug off kidlet and die? No, please don't suck it up. Kid might be traumatised because aunt isn't in control of her emotions right now and keeps bursting into tears and talking about \"when I die\" in front of her? Absolutely don't bring kid.\n\nWe saw my mum through eighteen months after diagnosis. There were days she desperately wanted the kids around her and days that would have been a terrible idea for everyone. In the early just-diagnosed days there were a lot more of the latter.", "Depends. Is she alone and asking for company while she processes? There\u2019s a lot of context to that that we don\u2019t have and it\u2019s not what op was asking about. \n\nFwiw if I was alone and overwhelmed yeah, I\u2019d probably call my brother.", "Idea: Dad can stay home with the kid. \ud83d\udca1", "This is a thing that depends on the treatment! (I know far too much about cancers and really wish I didn't).\n\nChemo itself tends to be a surprisingly short process - you get hooked up to a machine for an hour or two and then you unhook. How long it affects you after that depends on a lot of stuff - the type of chemo, how bad the cancer was, how much treatment you've already had. So there are chemos where people literally get treatment in the morning and go back to work in the afternoon. Generally what will happen is there will be a schedule: you'll get one, they'll give you X weeks for it to work through your body, they'll do a blood test to see how you coped with that and then they'll do another.\n\nEarly chemo can go one of two ways - if you got in with early diagnosis it might be a big load of nothing because your liver and kidneys are still working great. Or if you already had significant symptoms it can knock you out a bit. Some of them are really impressive though - like \"one dose and we'll need to keep you in overnight because that pregnancy sized lump in your belly will probably break down completely and your blood will be full of tumour but after you can recover from that you'll feel AMAZING\".\n\nSo, it depends a whole lot but \"I need your help for the week after the first dose and after that we'll see\" wouldn't be entirely unreasonable. I'm a little suspicious of how little OP seems to know though, it's unclear whether that's the parents not sharing or OP preferring to make themselves look better. If it is something like \"aunt was starting treatment on this day\" OP still wouldn't be obliged to take kid but it would explain why date couldn't be moved.", "Yep. They tried to make a power play and then threw a fit when it was ineffective.", "If so, I'm glad it backfired so badly on them.\n\nBut I really hate when people won't take no for an answer.", "Or they're at aunts and their entire attention is taken up by aunt so they're going to deal with it shortly.\n\nOr they're at aunts and emotions have hit them like a brick so talking is hard.\n\nHow long have they been ignoring OP for? OP doesn't say.", "It's a nasty one buuuut it's one of the more treatable ones. You'll feel like shit but if you start off relatively healthy there's every chance you'll live. I'd take it a million times over, say, liver cancer.\n\n(Husband had cancer of unknown primary. \"What cancer would you rather have\" was a weird but regular conversation).", "Hence my last sentence.", "I'm not getting the point. The kid could be brewing a cold, the parents could be brewing a cold, the kid could behave fine.... None of this makes it OPs issue to deal with. I have adult kids and one still in school - my youngest is my responsibility, not my older kids - doesn't matter what is going on. If they want to help, awesome. If they don't, it's on me.", "Physician here, an acute illness is an ailment that has a quick onset requiring short-term care with low chance of long term repercussions. In the medical field cancer is not considered an acute illness.", "Thank you for the explanation in more detail. I'm sorry you have to have such intimate knowledge of the process.\n\n I had the same thoughts on OP knowing so little. Did the parents tell him and he didn't listen? Did they say nothing and were vague? Did he ask and they didn't answer? It just seems like something like this would require a lot more discussion and not just a text back and forth. \n\nOP definitely isn't responsible for taking care of the sister no matter the circumstances, but I got the impression they would do it if it were a day later. I could be totally wrong about that too because I'm just a person on the Internet.", "I would have laughed at that from my dinner table tbh. The audacity.", "I don't think it's a weird one. They were trying to figure out if my mom's started in her brain and moved to her lungs or vice versa. We talked about which she would prefer of the 2 regularly.", "It  might even be one of the other reactions that come after a cancer diagnosis - that of blissful determined ignorance which is entirely not backed up by the facts.\n\nMy aunt, god bless her, is one of those - her brain literally doesn't absorb news  that isn't what she wants to hear. It means that some days she gets exasperated and confused (\"Well, WHY aren't you fine?\") and not wanting to offer help because in her brain everything went great, I should now be All Better, I'm clearly lazy, why do I want naps? I used to think it was malicious but I caught her last week literally telling all her friends my scan results were great (I didn't actually receive said results until the next day - and they were good! But at that point I didn't know). \n\nSo it's not even necessarily OP intentionally misleading as OP's brain instigating self protection but a lot of this seems weirdly vague."]}
