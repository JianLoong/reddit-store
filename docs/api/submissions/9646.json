And OP doesn't need to go into specifics \"we have stuff planned\" should be enough for a decline.

Some situations just need a no, others need a bit more communication and work.  \n\nI'm wondering if OP never actually wanted to babysit and is just telling us the anniversary was the reason why.

They are acting entitled and while they may be stressed it is their child and they need to continue to act like adults.  They need to respect your marriage and your time.

There's a big difference between a prognosis of imminent death, and one that suggests the aunt could live for months or even years (maybe with a good chance of remission?) According to yet another comment, OP indicated that the aunt's prognosis is more like the latter.\n\nSo, it's not an emergency; they could have postponed the trip by one day or more if they really needed OP's help.

I understand this isn't a standard everyone has to keep, but I retain the right to consider people shitty for not keeping this standard.\n\nThe specific actions by the parents you list came after OP blew off the situation, so they are NOT defenses of OPs failure.

If my mom ever came to me for help I\u2019d be there in a second, but that\u2019s probably because she\u2019s always led by example by being there for us. Rest of the family is the same.

I completely understand everyone else freaking out around you more than you.  Unfortunately,\nI had a massive meltdown when I got the news.  I was in my 30\u2019s and had breast cancer.  My mom was only a few years older than me when she died of breast cancer.  I was absolutely terrified I was going to end up dead at 40 like my mom.   \n\nI completely understand not having anyone to talk to about it.  It seemed like to me everybody kept comparing me to my mom and it just added to my anxiety.  Even the onc psych the clinic referred me to made things worse.  I finally found out that for me I had to deal with it my own way and that was just going on like normal.  I told my husband I don\u2019t want to be treated like I\u2019m sick, I just want life to be as normal as possible.  Once we had that established, I calmed down. \n\nAs far as hormone blockers I tried those before chemo.  Let me tell you I went into the deepest, darkest depression of my life.  I had crippling anxiety attacks.  Simple questions like what do you want for dinner would send me into a severe panic attack, I\u2019m talking hyperventilating, sobbing uncontrollably, felt like I was having a heart attack type of reaction.  I would have them anywhere between 10 and 20 times a day.  I had to fight to not drive my car head on into a Mack truck or off a bridge.  Once I got to that point, I turned my car around, drove to my oncologist and said we have something different or you will have to place me in a psych ward because I\u2019m a danger to myself on these medications.   I would rather do chemo a million times over than feel the way I did on those medications for even 10 seconds.  I tell you this not to scare you but warn you to watch out for these side effects because they can be horrible.  It started about a month in and progressively got worse until I quit taking them. \n\nMy port hurt the entire time.  It never got better.  I got mine out December 21st and I was so relieved.

Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle them here because I don\u2019t think I would have been able to go pee by myself, they would probably freak out and be like well someone should be with you in case you fall.  They wouldn\u2019t allow me to do anything for myself and all it would do is remind me that I was sick and fighting a deadly disease.  For me having them around would have messed with my mental health more than anything.  I know they would have been extremely helpful probably too much so and all I wanted to do was keep my life as normal as possible and I know they wouldn\u2019t have let me.  They were super upset I continued to work through treatment, criticized my husband for letting me work through treatment (not that he could have stopped me), I have a white collar, high income desk job and I\u2019m the primary breadwinner for my family and also the one who carries our health insurance so it wasn\u2019t an option to not work (my company is great and would let me take as many breaks as I needed, leave whenever I needed to, gave me longer lunch breaks to go take a nap, let me work from home if I wanted to, let me take as much time off as I needed no questions asked, they did everything to support me and let me stay working.  They kept telling me my health is more important than anything at work so if I needed to take a day, a week, a month they would cover me, no problem) If I had been babied the my family tries to I would have absolutely snapped.
