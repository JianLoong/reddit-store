I was going to buy her flowers and all.\n\nThen out of the blue, one day before my anniversary, I get a text from my mom demanding me to babysit my sister for a week, while she and my dad go visit my aunt who recently got diagnosed with leukemia.\n\nNow, I love my sister. We're 18 years apart but are still closer than ever. She has a bit of a mental challenge but otherwise Is a pretty normal kid.\n\nI was debating whether to say yes, but I didn't want a kid in tow while I was having a date with my wife.\n\nSo I politely declined and didn't get an answer, so I thought it was okay.\n\nThe next day, we're at the restaurant when my phone startes buzzing like crazy, I check it and it's filled with texts from my mom and dad.\n\nThey're calling me all sorts of things and saying that they showed up at my house, only for it to be empty.\n\nThey're now ignoring me, when I write to them and I haven't gotten an answer.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit : My wife and I also have to work for more than half of those days\n\nEdit : Me and my wife have known each other since we were kids! And started dating when we were teenagers!\n\nEdit : My sister Is currently staying with a family friend who we've known all our lives.\nThe friend has two kids who are very close to my sister. The family friend said she wouldn't mind keeping her for the week as she gets a break from her twins, and encouraged me to relax.\n\nEdit : My aunt Is NOT in critical condition, she Is doing fine. She also lives far away, and it takes a couple of hours to get to her. (3 hours and a little more due to stops and other things, so It takes 4-5 hours probably.)\n\nUPDATE! : I have gone over to the friends house, and gotten them food for the kind gesture. I can clearly see that my sister enjoys the twins company, and the friend doesn't work, so I intent to keep her there. However, the friend informed me, that my parents were talking bad about me and my wife in her messages. She told me they were berating me for 'being a bad son' and that 'my wife probably convinced me to stay away from an important situation'. I intent to speak to them about this once they come back, I don't want to intrude when my aunt has leukemia.", "created_utc": 1676061643, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10z2fod/aita_for_wanting_to_spend_time_with_ny_wife/", "score": 7459, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think? I\u2019ve gotten into a clinical trial where the hypothesis is that they can keep the cancer at bay with just hormone blockers and not have to do chemo. That being said they\u2019re not sure and I\u2019ve got a port placed in case they\u2019re wrong. \n\nOn the plus side, as much as getting that placed hurt, it is really really nice that I no longer have people constantly stabbing me in my arms only to realize they missed and have to do it again.", "You are right and that is kind of what I was referring to. We're they going there to help eg, cooking, cleaning, gardening, washing, taking care of stuff like taking her to appointments. If yes and the Aunt asked them to go then great. If they were just going and expecting to be looked after while wringing their hands and feeling sorry for themselves that someone they know is exceptionally I'll, then that is not ok.", "You are right. There were other people to look after her. They said they could not do it and that should have been respected. For me family is everything and I would have either done it and been secretly pissed (yes it would have been my fault) or said no but if they could wait a couple of days then yes I could.", "Surely then it's ESH?\n\n\nIf my husband put an anniversary over a family member dying I'd be outraged!", "I've been in a relationship for 5 years actually. Anniversaries are nice days but they aren't emergencies. You can celebrate another day.", "Anniversaries are important but they don\u2019t take precedence over emergencies.", "I'd be pissed if my husband said no the what was asked without at least TELLING ME!\n\n\"Hey wife my aunt was just told she had cancer and Mum wants us to have sister for a few days.... Should we include her in our plans? Delay? Or do you want me to ask if anyone else can help?\"\n\n\nIt's not hard to ask!", "Sometimes politely declining isn't enough.  And OP doesn't need to go into specifics \"we have stuff planned\" should be enough for a decline.  But if OP kept up the communication, it may not have gotten to the point where their phone was exploding with messages.  \n\nSometimes, \"No\" is more than a complete answer.  Some situations just need a no, others need a bit more communication and work.  \n\nI'm wondering if OP never actually wanted to babysit and is just telling us the anniversary was the reason why.  If OP was happy to do the babysitting, but \"just not this week\", they should have said that.", "So your NTA because you aren't REQUIRED to do anything like this; however, I will say if your aunt just got diagnosed with leukemia it would have been a nice gesture to say you can't on a specific day but you could help out on others.  \n\nIf you had made the plans you could have still done this while working to assist your parents.  \n\nNow I will say your parents are definitely acting like AHs because you stated you told them you couldn't and they just ignored and expected you to.  They are acting entitled and while they may be stressed it is their child and they need to continue to act like adults.  They need to respect your marriage and your time.  They are doing neither and should apologize for the way they acted but it is unlikely you will get that.", "[deleted]", "\"Demanded\" is OP interpretation.  Since none of us witnessed this interaction, it's hard to say if they demanded or simply asked.", "I can respect your position. It makes logical sense.", "One problem is that the OP keeps leaving important information out. There's a big difference between a prognosis of imminent death, and one that suggests the aunt could live for months or even years (maybe with a good chance of remission?) According to yet another comment, OP indicated that the aunt's prognosis is more like the latter.\n\nSo, it's not an emergency; they could have postponed the trip by one day or more if they really needed OP's help. But then OP arguably should have talked this out with them instead of just declining.\n\nEdit: OP is not the AH for not being proactive in helping them, whereas they are AHs for trying to force OP's hand instead of negotiating by offering to postpone.", "I wish I had written that in my original comment as I agree with it so wholeheartedly.", "I, personally, care where my sister stays and I care to know that she is taken care of. I understand this isn't a standard everyone has to keep, but I retain the right to consider people shitty for not keeping this standard.\n\nThe specific actions by the parents you list came after OP blew off the situation, so they are NOT defenses of OPs failure. They are examples of the parents being shitty, but that's already covered under my ESH. So, I don't know why you listed them and I suspect you had a dishonest reason for doing so.", "I mean to each their own, but wow.", "That\u2019s incredibly insensitive. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a medical emergency, it\u2019s a family emergency where someone needs support after receiving devastating news.", "> Who said she\u2019s gravely sick? Yes, leukemia is bad, but\n\njesus christ, just stop there\n\nETA: \nI'm very sorry to hear what you're going through, but I encourage you not to think of cancer remission rates as a race. That's just not a good attitude on the matter, everyone's trying to get through it. No need to minimize tragedy or impact when life gives it out in spades.", "Cancer is devastating and even if it\u2019s early the emotional strain of finding this out is likely very extreme. I\u2019ve Gone through this with family members several times, and no they did not all survive; specifically with leukemia. \n\nFamily (literal sibling in OPs case) seems like a more logical first choice for babysitter than a friend. \n\nI already said NTA because it was very last minute and the parents reaction was definitely shitty, don\u2019t agree with them either. \n\nBroadly speaking though I stand by my comment; these family dynamics seem very cold and unloving to me. If my mom ever came to me for help I\u2019d be there in a second, but that\u2019s probably because she\u2019s always led by example by being there for us. Rest of the family is the same.

Anything the kid has could spread to the aunt.", "It kinda depends what mental state aunt was in, how she was doing with the diagnosis and who she wanted around her.\n\nIf she has plenty of family and help around her, she's coping mentally and mum is visiting just for her own sake then no it's not.\n\nHowever if she's taken the diagnosis badly - as some people do - and she wants her sister there it might actually be an emergency. My mum, not previously noted for mental health issues, was damn near suicidal for the week after diagnosis to the point where we didn't dare leave her with her meds.", "A possibly terminal diagnosis isn't acute?? Jeez I'd hate to be in your circle!", "100% true.", "If your sister was diagnosed with CANCER would you wait two days?

I just answered their question.", "The friend has two kids who are very close to my sister. The family friend said she wouldn't mind keeping her for the week as she gets a break from her twins, and encouraged me to relax.", "Honestly I can see the point of her not going with them if the aunt is going through chemo. \n\nIf my math is right the kid is 6 years old and at their age they\u2019re little Petri dishes. Considering chemo drastically weakens your immune system to the point where a simple cold could be deadly, I wouldn\u2019t think she should be brought with.", "Even if he was, he wouldn't be the AH. It's not on him to care for his sister, it's on their parents.", "Why? He's a grown man with his own life. He isn't required to watch his sister on demand! That's ridiculous for you to call him the A H. On top of that, it was his five year anniversary and he clearly stated he had big plans. It wasn't like he was sitting at home sitting around refusing to help his parents out.", "I\u2019m so sorry! Ironically, December  21st is the day I had my mastectomy and saved my life.  I completely understand everyone else freaking out around you more than you.  Unfortunately,\nI had a massive meltdown when I got the news.  I was in my 30\u2019s and had breast cancer.  My mom was only a few years older than me when she died of breast cancer.  I was absolutely terrified I was going to end up dead at 40 like my mom.   \n\nI completely understand not having anyone to talk to about it.  It seemed like to me everybody kept comparing me to my mom and it just added to my anxiety.  Even the onc psych the clinic referred me to made things worse.  I finally found out that for me I had to deal with it my own way and that was just going on like normal.  I told my husband I don\u2019t want to be treated like I\u2019m sick, I just want life to be as normal as possible.  Once we had that established, I calmed down. \n\nAs far as hormone blockers I tried those before chemo.  Let me tell you I went into the deepest, darkest depression of my life.  I had crippling anxiety attacks.  Simple questions like what do you want for dinner would send me into a severe panic attack, I\u2019m talking hyperventilating, sobbing uncontrollably, felt like I was having a heart attack type of reaction.  I would have them anywhere between 10 and 20 times a day.  I had to fight to not drive my car head on into a Mack truck or off a bridge.  Once I got to that point, I turned my car around, drove to my oncologist and said we have something different or you will have to place me in a psych ward because I\u2019m a danger to myself on these medications.   I would rather do chemo a million times over than feel the way I did on those medications for even 10 seconds.  I tell you this not to scare you but warn you to watch out for these side effects because they can be horrible.  It started about a month in and progressively got worse until I quit taking them. \n\nMy port hurt the entire time.  It never got better.  I got mine out December 21st and I was so relieved.  I have great veins so sticking me never was a problem.  I have one vein in my arm they joke they could hit from across the room it\u2019s so good.", "My family is the worst about things, they babied the hell out of me through it.  Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle them here because I don\u2019t think I would have been able to go pee by myself, they would probably freak out and be like well someone should be with you in case you fall.  They wouldn\u2019t allow me to do anything for myself and all it would do is remind me that I was sick and fighting a deadly disease.  For me having them around would have messed with my mental health more than anything.  I know they would have been extremely helpful probably too much so and all I wanted to do was keep my life as normal as possible and I know they wouldn\u2019t have let me.  They were super upset I continued to work through treatment, criticized my husband for letting me work through treatment (not that he could have stopped me), I have a white collar, high income desk job and I\u2019m the primary breadwinner for my family and also the one who carries our health insurance so it wasn\u2019t an option to not work (my company is great and would let me take as many breaks as I needed, leave whenever I needed to, gave me longer lunch breaks to go take a nap, let me work from home if I wanted to, let me take as much time off as I needed no questions asked, they did everything to support me and let me stay working.  They kept telling me my health is more important than anything at work so if I needed to take a day, a week, a month they would cover me, no problem) If I had been babied the my family tries to I would have absolutely snapped.

(I know far too much about cancers and really wish I didn't).\n\nChemo itself tends to be a surprisingly short process - you get hooked up to a machine for an hour or two and then you unhook. How long it affects you after that depends on a lot of stuff - the type of chemo, how bad the cancer was, how much treatment you've already had. So there are chemos where people literally get treatment in the morning and go back to work in the afternoon. Generally what will happen is there will be a schedule: you'll get one, they'll give you X weeks for it to work through your body, they'll do a blood test to see how you coped with that and then they'll do another.\n\nEarly chemo can go one of two ways - if you got in with early diagnosis it might be a big load of nothing because your liver and kidneys are still working great. Or if you already had significant symptoms it can knock you out a bit. Some of them are really impressive though - like \"one dose and we'll need to keep you in overnight because that pregnancy sized lump in your belly will probably break down completely and your blood will be full of tumour but after you can recover from that you'll feel AMAZING\".\n\nSo, it depends a whole lot but \"I need your help for the week after the first dose and after that we'll see\" wouldn't be entirely unreasonable.

Though it sounds like I am lucky with the port. About a week after it got placed it felt like my artery was hurting if that makes any sense? Turns out I had overextended myself because 10lbs is a lot less than you think it is. And the site does twinge a little bit sometimes but not bad at all. It could change if I do end up needing chemo here, but that\u2019s a future me problem. \n\nAnd thank you. I will absolutely keep an eye on that.

I\u2019d been having it off and on for a while, but I thought they were normal cramps because I\u2019ve always gotten painful cramps and they\u2019d go away if I took Tylenol and used a heating pad. But this time they woke me up at 4:30 am and just wouldn\u2019t go away so it hurt to stand up, hurt to lay down, and hurt to sit down. \n\nI was hoping for constipation and worried it was appendicitis. Turns out it was a 20cm tumor and a lot of fluid built up in my abdomen. Funny thing is that as soon as the ER doc stabbed me and drained out the fluid the abdominal pain went away. Well the pain from where he stabbed me with a giant ass needle and wiggled it around because it took him a hot minute to get the needle in the right spot was still there but the next day I felt perfectly fine. \n\nBut, because of how big the tumor was and how it was placed they had no idea of it was attached to an ovary or my appendix. So they had me sign what felt like a million consent forms for every possible scenario (cancer vs benign and ovary vs appendix) and then I got filleted like a fish. Sliced from navel to pubic bone. Lost 20lbs over night. 0/10 do not recommend. \n\nAnyway, as I said, turned out to be ovarian and they took everything. The did get all of the cancer, but they also took my uterus, ovaries, and cervix. I\u2019m in my mid 30\u2019s and I hadn\u2019t decided if I wanted kids or not yet. But when they asked me before hand how focused should they be on preserving fertility I said take why you have to. I didn\u2019t want to die and I figured better alive with no biological children than to die with young biological children. \n\nBecause I am very well aware that if I make it to 50 it\u2019ll be a goddamned miracle. Ovarian keeps coming back like a bad penny and the clinical trial is to see if it\u2019ll stay in remission as long as it does for people who get chemo followed by hormone blockers or if chemo is needed first. \n\nAnyway after that major surgery (32 staples btw) I was back at work 2.5 weeks later because I just wanted everything to be normal again. \n\nSorry for the word vomit but its nice to get out and I appreciate the advice.", "Yes, me too.

What's with the \"It's their problem to get a babysitter for their daughter.\" Ahem? That daughter is OP's sister???", "NTA but not a good communicator you could have spoken with them, explained that you had other unshakable plans (since this wasnt a real emergency) and offered to host your sister for part of the time. But ultimately you declined so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So, 1st Of I don't know much about children myself. Second off, I have to more than half of those days and so does my wife.", "You clearly do not have experience being around children", "I think it's an upbringing thing... Push someone into catering for others since their childhood, and that might be very well what you get.", "I understand what you're saying and agree. I guess people think they want to spend more time with people before they go? Like they didn't get round to it before. But, if that's the case, people should really appreciate what and who they have before it gets to that stage and visit with their friends and family.", "Honestly? That\u2019s kinda the other side of the humans being humans coin. It really hurts to see this person hurting, or they want to remember them as they were, or even they just don\u2019t know how to handle their or others\u2019 grief/worry (who does, there\u2019s never a right thing to say) and don\u2019t want to step on toes so they just back way off and hope they do as little harm as possible. It can suck (it can also not, depending on the wishes of the ill), but it\u2019s just as normal as the smothering that other people can do. All of which to say, think of them however you want but I hope maybe that brings you some peace? And I\u2019m glad your mom is doing well."]}
