{"id": 32573, "submission_id": "18dajuu", "title": "AITA for wanting to stick to a limit for my niece\u2019s Christmas present?", "selftext": "I (47F) have three nieces (14, 18, 20) who I give Christmas presents to every year. They will usually send their Christmas Wishlists to me as I would otherwise not know what to give them. I usually set a cost limit of $75-100 per each niece. \n\nLast year, the oldest had a wishlist where there were no gifts under $200 and I chose to gift her a $100 Uber gift card instead of an item that was on her list. By contrast, her sisters had wishlists with some gifts that were under the $100 limit and I chose to gift those presents to them in keeping with my limits. This summer I heard that my oldest niece was very upset after Christmas that I didn\u2019t get her anything off her list when I gifted her sisters from their respective lists and that she thought I was \u2018playing favorites\u2019, and that \u2018was rude\u2019 and that it \u2018better not happen again\u2019.\n\nThis year the same thing has happened. My oldest niece has chosen gifts that are over $200 each with the exception of a matching clothing set where each clothing piece is less than $100 but the whole set (which really is meant to be bought together) is over $200. Her sisters have a range of prices for their gifts, some of which are under $100. I am leaning toward keeping to my cost limits this year again and gifting from the younger nieces lists and giving a $100 gift card to my oldest. \n\nMoney is not the issue. I can well afford any of the gifts on my oldest niece\u2019s Christmas list. I mostly feel obligated to stick to my principles around limiting cost knowing that my oldest niece could get upset again. \n\nDoes sticking to my principles knowing that my oldest niece could (and likely will) be hurt make me the AH?  It feels like it.\n\nEdited to answer a few common questions.\n\n- Did I talk to my niece about the limits? I\u2019ve always had the limit; it was just never an issue until last year so no one knew about except me. After I found out how upset she was this past summer, I told her parents about the limits before the lists were sent, but I can\u2019t say for sure if she knew about the limits when she made her list. \n\n- Have you explained to your niece what happened in 2022? No, I learned about her feelings 7 months after the fact and there would be no way to talk to my niece about it without outing the person who accidentally told me. Plus my niece seemed fine with me at later family gatherings and still does, so I chose to let sleeping dogs lie. \n\n- can\u2019t you talk to your niece about the limit/ask her to revise her list/etc.? Even though it feels dirty to talk about how much I\u2019ll spend per gift, I have no fear of talking to my niece; it\u2019s about finding the correct approach with her since she is very sensitive soul who doesn\u2019t like to be singled out, so asking her only to revise her list to fit in with the limits would be a disaster. \n\n- does she use Uber? Yes she does.

You definitely need to speak with her and explain why she received what she got last year and your expectations this year", "I completely understand. It doesn't feel like proper etiquette to have to tell someone how much you have to spend on a gift. Even if you've never told your niece a budget, she's super out of touch with reality. There aren't a lot of people who spend $100 on Christmas gifts, let alone more than that. It seems as if she's only ever gotten what she wants, therefore the cost aspect is lost on her. You shouldn't have to discuss what your budget is period. Your niece should have items ranging from $10 and up. Not $200 and up. The fact that she only has high cost items reeks of entitlement and therefore sets the stage for others to have to either be uncomfortable discussing their budget or purchasing a gift card to avoid discussing it.", "Can't multiple adults decide to pool their money and this 1 niece gets 1 gift from her expensive list as a group gift from all those adults together? -- or each adult gets 1 item from those clothing sets?", "So, she has never been told about your price limit?

Anything from $10 for a nice tart pan, up to $80 for a heated mattress pad. I\u2019ve only asked for anything over that price range a handful of times.
