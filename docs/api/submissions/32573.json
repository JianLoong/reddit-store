{"id": 32573, "submission_id": "18dajuu", "title": "AITA for wanting to stick to a limit for my niece\u2019s Christmas present?", "selftext": "I (47F) have three nieces (14, 18, 20) who I give Christmas presents to every year. They will usually send their Christmas Wishlists to me as I would otherwise not know what to give them. I usually set a cost limit of $75-100 per each niece. \n\nLast year, the oldest had a wishlist where there were no gifts under $200 and I chose to gift her a $100 Uber gift card instead of an item that was on her list. By contrast, her sisters had wishlists with some gifts that were under the $100 limit and I chose to gift those presents to them in keeping with my limits. This summer I heard that my oldest niece was very upset after Christmas that I didn\u2019t get her anything off her list when I gifted her sisters from their respective lists and that she thought I was \u2018playing favorites\u2019, and that \u2018was rude\u2019 and that it \u2018better not happen again\u2019.\n\nThis year the same thing has happened. My oldest niece has chosen gifts that are over $200 each with the exception of a matching clothing set where each clothing piece is less than $100 but the whole set (which really is meant to be bought together) is over $200. Her sisters have a range of prices for their gifts, some of which are under $100. I am leaning toward keeping to my cost limits this year again and gifting from the younger nieces lists and giving a $100 gift card to my oldest. \n\nMoney is not the issue. I can well afford any of the gifts on my oldest niece\u2019s Christmas list. I mostly feel obligated to stick to my principles around limiting cost knowing that my oldest niece could get upset again. \n\nDoes sticking to my principles knowing that my oldest niece could (and likely will) be hurt make me the AH?  It feels like it.\n\nEdited to answer a few common questions.\n\n- Did I talk to my niece about the limits? I\u2019ve always had the limit; it was just never an issue until last year so no one knew about except me. After I found out how upset she was this past summer, I told her parents about the limits before the lists were sent, but I can\u2019t say for sure if she knew about the limits when she made her list. \n\n- Have you explained to your niece what happened in 2022? No, I learned about her feelings 7 months after the fact and there would be no way to talk to my niece about it without outing the person who accidentally told me. Plus my niece seemed fine with me at later family gatherings and still does, so I chose to let sleeping dogs lie. \n\n- can\u2019t you talk to your niece about the limit/ask her to revise her list/etc.? Even though it feels dirty to talk about how much I\u2019ll spend per gift, I have no fear of talking to my niece; it\u2019s about finding the correct approach with her since she is very sensitive soul who doesn\u2019t like to be singled out, so asking her only to revise her list to fit in with the limits would be a disaster. \n\n- does she use Uber? Yes she does.

If so, when coupled with the fact that you\u2019ve never explained your arbitrary limits before, then YWBTA. You set expectations with these girls that you give a gift from their list *every year*, so imagine being the only one that, in twenty years, that ever received *nothing* from your list when everyone else did. \n\nIt would have cost you nothing to send a gentle request for an updated list with items that fall within your (again, arbitrary) limits that you never once indicated existed. \n\nAnd sure, the oldest surely has a small entitlement problem, but it sounds like she never once acted out toward you even a little, so I don\u2019t see it as a problem. Everyone is entitled to feel the way they do in private. \n\nIf you\u2019re not getting anything from her 2023 list, tell her. Ask for a revision. Or get her some (not all) of the clothing ensemble. Do you really think she\u2019d be mad for only getting some of it?", "INFO: Are the girls aware you set a limit? Maybe N20 isn't aware the lit is 100.", "NTA.

Or maybe don\u2019t give her anything.", "NTA but I don't understand the third bullet point here. Just call her up and say, \"You've got a lot of really nice things on your wishlist but my budget this year is $100 and under for *everyone*, is there anything else you'd like to add?\" You would be TA if you didn't tell her and just felt weirdly hurt by the whole thing (her too).", "I recommend the Human Fund.

Usually socks, hey dudes or a new pair of moccasins, and a gift card. \n\nI\u2019m not the kind of person who is comfortable asking for big gifts anyways. I think the most extravagant thing I\u2019ve asked for from anyone in recent years was a video game that cost $70 for my birthday.

As if we can suddenly read your mind at 20. It's not too old to have a wishlist, but it is too old to \"accidentally\" only put really expensive things on it. And also too old to not understand how money works. The entitlement in the oldest kid is amazing.", "NTA. But I STRONGLY disagree with 20 years old being too old for Christmas lists. I would *much* rather know what my older niblings want.\n\nOtherwise, I'm giving them stuff they don't want/already have & I might as well set fire to $ in my backyard instead.

Nope, I ask my kids and their spouses for wish lists, I always say give me a huge list that way when I pick a few things it\u2019s still a surprise.

If you added up the monetary value of the gifts I got from all of my aunts and uncles combined in any given year of my life I don't think they'd add up to $200 total let alone expecting one aunt to spend that much on me. \n\nI even made sure that my wedding registry had some items under ten dollars on it (both for people who wanted to get a gift and didn't have much money and for people who had like a $60 budget, chose a $50 main gift, and wanted to round it up with a smaller add-on).", "I\u2019m 30 and my family still asks for a Christmas list.

It doesn't have to be taken as a decree, you can always buy something that's not on the list. But everybody's got busy lives, and everybody wants to give people gifts that they would actually want.\n\nI've been with my wife for over 15 years, but there is literally no amount of paying attention to my wife's preferences that would allow me to decode her likes and dislikes with clothes, cosmetics, jewelry, etc. I could quit my job and spend my days studying her closet and makeup drawer, and I still would not be able to identify the \"right\" things if sent into a store left to my own devices.\n\nLikewise, she can't tell the difference between avant-garde dissonant death metal and Hot Topic mallcore stuff, and the amount of effort it would take for her to get there is unreasonable to expect, when a simple list with some band names and albums that I don't already have would give her all the direction she needs.", "I disagree that there's an age limit for a christmas list.
