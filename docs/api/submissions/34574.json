There is something I would like to address before getting to the update. There a few lengthy threads about how Ashely must be using weaponized incompetence since she failed her driver's test several times. The written part she has passed, its the driving section that she fails all the time. You see she has ADHD and is on the spectrum so she tenses up a lot when she gets behind the wheel. While her anxiety has gone down in recent years, driving is still a sore spot.\r  \n\r  \nNow, many of you (including me) believed that this was all just financial abuse and she wanted control of my money. Well we were all wrong.\r  \n\r  \nYesterday I went out to take care of a few errands and when I came back Ashely came to me with tears. It had looked like she had been crying for a long time. She apologized for getting angry at me and for avoiding me. She said she knew my old car was on its last legs and knew a new one was necessary. She also understood that there would be plenty of money left. Ashely admitted she wasn't mad about the money, it was actually the memories of my old car. She only mentioned the wedding because she didn't want to sound pathetic and seemed to be the most obvious choice.\r  \n\r  \nYou see last year we had a 14 year old German Shepherd that we sadly had to put down after she got cancer. Ashely had her ever since she was a pup and loved her very much and so did I. Ashely was an absolute mess after that. We never took down her crate and had placed her old blankets, pillows as well as her leash and collar in it.\r  \n\r  \nWhat does this have to do with my car? I still had her old blanket in my old car whenever we took her out. Some of her fur was also still in the back seat as I almost never vacuumed the back. Ashely was afraid of forgetting her and that's why she wanted me to keep the car.\r  \n\r  \nI assured Ashely that I love her and that I loved our dog. If it meant anything, I took the blanket out of the car which she asked me to place in the crate. I had donated my old car but the tow truck won't be there to pick it up until tomorrow so she asked to see the old car one last time.\r  \n\r  \nSo we drove to the lot and she had a tearful goodbye over it. I took her out to eat after that to get her mind away from it.\r  \n\r  \nSo there you have it everyone.

I'm the same as her. I have their collars hanging right beside my desk. It's hard to let them go. Send her a hug for me.", "Thank you for the update! I wish you both to be happy together!", "Aw I feel this so hard. I have a sweatshirt I won't wash because it has my corgi's fur on it from when I held him for the last time. I'm crying.", "Well THAT took a turn into weepytown!", "This is almost unbearably bitter sweet. My Dad passed recently and I'm afraid to clean too much because it will literally wipe him away. \n\nLoss is so impossibly hard and complicated and different for everyone. People should just talk to each other. \n\nIt sounds like you two have a lot of love between you. I hope you have a long and happy life together. Good luck!", "i find it odd everyone jumped financial abuse yes she was being controlling but seemed this was the first instance and its not like she was keeping you from having access to your money she wasnt. she was asking you not to buy the car which i think its fine you did! but even before this update she was not financially abusing you ive seen financially abuse plenty of times this is not the case she had no control over your money as shown that you went out and purchased even when she said no which is think was fine again. so she was not financially abusing you maybe you could\u2019ve said she was being manipulative before finding out this info. happy for you though! but id be hurt if i was your wife and you accused me of abusing you. just in my opinion\u2026. dont everyone get mad at mr bcz i have no prob with what op did he was nta and still isnt i just find it odd to jump to abuse so quick", "It almost made ME cry, too. I\u2019ve had my furbaby \ud83d\udc31since she was about 8 weeks old, and she\u2019s 16 years old now. She\u2019s the only pet I\u2019ve ever had, and I can\u2019t imagine losing her\u2026"]}
