{"id": 9412, "submission_id": "10wk1o9", "title": "AITA for setting conditions on attending daughter's wedding?", "selftext": "Last year, my wife and I politely declined my daughter's wedding invitation, and tried to set up a lunch for some time after the wedding instead. This is because we are Christians and, unfortunately my daughter is lesbian, but we still love her, and we want to extend love to her partner as well. However, my daughter was adamant, that unless we attended the wedding, she would no longer have us in her life. After many weeks of back and forth, my wife and I decided that, if our daughter wanted us to attend her wedding, despite it going against our beliefs, we had 5 conditions:\n\n1) I would not be walking her down the aisle\n2) We would be not doing any dances\n3) We would not be taking any pictures\n4) We will not be giving any toasts, saying any words, or staying for anything after the actual wedding\n5) We want to be seated in the back, so after the wedding we can make a quick exit. We will settle on a front seat if it is near an exit.\n\nWe told her that only if she agreed to these 5 conditions, then we would attend. She was upset, but I think it's only fair. As Christians, we want to make it very clear that we do not give our approval to the ceremony and are attending against our will; but since our daughter wants us to be at the wedding so bad, I thought that this would be the best compromise. \n\nApparently my daughter posted our conditions in the wedding group chat that she has with her friends and she keeps sending us screenshots from people in that group chat who keep commenting about how pathetic we are as parents. But I've noticed that these are all coming from friends that we don't know, ones that she probably made in college, so it's hard for me to say their opinions are unbiased. So are we TA for setting conditions to a wedding that we are being guilt-tripped to attend?", "created_utc": 1675821395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wk1o9/aita_for_setting_conditions_on_attending/", "score": 277, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is because we are Christians and, unfortunately my daughter is lesbian, but we still love her, and we want to extend love to her partner as well. However, my daughter was adamant, that unless we attended the wedding, she would no longer have us in her life. After many weeks of back and forth, my wife and I decided that, if our daughter wanted us to attend her wedding, despite it going against our beliefs, we had 5 conditions:\n\n1) I would not be walking her down the aisle\n2) We would be not doing any dances\n3) We would not be taking any pictures\n4) We will not be giving any toasts, saying any words, or staying for anything after the actual wedding\n5) We want to be seated in the back, so after the wedding we can make a quick exit. We will settle on a front seat if it is near an exit.\n\nWe told her that only if she agreed to these 5 conditions, then we would attend. She was upset, but I think it's only fair. As Christians, we want to make it very clear that we do not give our approval to the ceremony and are attending against our will; but since our daughter wants us to be at the wedding so bad, I thought that this would be the best compromise. \n\nApparently my daughter posted our conditions in the wedding group chat that she has with her friends and she keeps sending us screenshots from people in that group chat who keep commenting about how pathetic we are as parents. But I've noticed that these are all coming from friends that we don't know, ones that she probably made in college, so it's hard for me to say their opinions are unbiased. So are we TA for setting conditions to a wedding that we are being guilt-tripped to attend?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?\n\nc) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.\n\nd) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?\n\ne) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?\n\nf) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an Abomination (Lev 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n\ng) Lev 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?\n\nh) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev 19:27. How should they die?\n\ni) I know from Lev 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?\n\nj) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev 24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws?
