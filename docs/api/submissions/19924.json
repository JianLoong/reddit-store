We divorced a little less than a year ago after some actions on his part, he was with another woman. I got majority custody, he gets to see him every other weekend. My lawyer advised me not to allow my ex to have any contact whatsoever with my son outside of custody time, as he could use that to get more for himself.\n\nAnyway a month ago, my son got appendicitis and spent three days in the hospital, it was very routine, he was never in any real danger. My ex wanted to visit him, but I reminded him that it wasn't his custody time, and he had no right to do that. I did eventually allow a short phonecall, both because my son had been asking, and because my ex was threatening to get the courts involved.\n\nMy son is fine now, and he's practically forgotten it ever happened. My ex however has been hounding my lawyer, saying that he has the right to visit my son when he's sick. I expected most people to be on my side after how our marriage ended, but most people have been saying I was cruel. Even my divorced friends said they would've let him come. But I donmt want him having any excuse to take my son away from me more than he already does, or allow him to weasel his way out of child support.", "created_utc": 1687041051, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14c3sgx/aita_for_not_letting_my_exhusband_visit_our_son/", "score": 307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which after what you just pulled if it does ever happen he won't be at all inclined to let you visit him. What happens when important occasions happen when it's dad's time?

Honestly you just gift wrapped him a very sympathetic reason for the court to give him additional time, if not out right custody. Of course, we don\u2019t know the back story, but on the surface this is going to come across as petty and vindictive, even cruel. Your son was sick and wanted his dad. You wanted to be right.

The thought of him made me sick. \n\nBut I sucked it up, and was kind to him. Not just kind, but understanding and empathetic. I checked on him, while raising his child by myself and running myself into the ground. It was so ridiculous, because no one was checking on me, and I was the one dealing with everything. But cussing him out and telling him what a loser he is wasn\u2019t Going to be what convinced him to step up and be a good dad. So I tried to kill him with kindness and I did for an entire year. \n\nDid he deserve that grace as my ex-fianc\u00e9? Absolutely not. \n\nDoes my daughters father deserve that grace? For the sake of my child, he absolutely does. \n\nAnd it worked. I had to eat shit and bear it for a few months, and swallow my pride time and time again. But I reminded myself that it\u2019s not about me. And when all is said and done, I want to be able to tell my child I tried my absolute best to facilitate the relationship between her and her dad. And yeah he came around(kinda), and he\u2019s a fantastic dad when he shows up. But he doesn\u2019t show up very often. And my daughter asks for her dad way more often than her dad actually comes. I would do ANYTHING for her to have a father who fought to see her. \n\nSo stories like yours make me sick, because you just don\u2019t get it. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to watch your kid want their daddy, and not know how to explain why daddy doesn\u2019t want them too.

My dad was a complete ass to her after. Guess what they both still did? Visit my brother in the hospital. They would take turns usually and not be in the room together but even with all that she never ever would\u2019ve considered blocking him. And for us, hospital stays were pretty normal. Little brother has a rare disease so it was our norm. For a not normal situation it\u2019s even more ridiculous to me to block the other parent because it\u2019s not their day - that\u2019s for actual custody, not visits.

Him just *seeing and speaking* with your son doesn't mean son isn't currently in your custody.

Him saying he got to see him ONE extra day jn court wouldn't have changed a damn thing. You basically screwed yourself at this point for denying him to see him AT THE HOSPITAL.

Having both parents there to support him would have been the best thing *for him*.\n\nHave you lost sight of that? Your obligation as a parent is to do what's best for your child.

I do hope dad takes your bum back to court and lays it on thick how you REFUSED HIM TO SEE HIS SICK CHILD!!!!\n\nAdditional: At 12 or 13, my son came down with appendix issues one weekend.  His dad and step mom and the family with him went to hike at a local park.  He got a stitch in the side that was really annoying him.  By the following Wednesday, he was not feeling so good and they took him to ER and called me as I was just getting to church to have the evening meal and study time and had taken my niece.  (For context: Dad and I agreed out of court over custody--he had primary physical for school and we shared 50/50 legal custody for decisions.)  They told me they would call me later to let me know if the doctors were sure on it being his appendix.  I told them no way was I going to sit back and wait and I would be up.  I sent my niece home with my parents and let my sister know and went to the hospital.  I got there and son was in a room with his dad and step mom waiting for a CAT scan to come back.  It was positive for appendix being bad.  His dad did not tell me I could not come or be there.  He did not like me anymore and had been hateful a lot before this happened.  We sat there for a bit and the surgeon came out and told us that it would take an hour for the operation and they would let us know how things went.  Shortly, my ex and his wife had people coming out of the cracks and crevices to pray with them and sit with them.  I sat by myself for that hour across the way from them. None of them came over to see if I needed someone to talk to or pray with or what have you.  After a long hour of worry, son came out of surgery fine and all had gone well.  It was a relief.  Once he was in a room on the PEDs floor, his dad and step mom had to go home to the other kids (step sibs) because there was no one home. I called work and let them know what happened and I would not be in the next day to work.  I stayed all night at the hospital with my son so someone was there with him.  And he admitted to me he wanted me there more than anyone.  \n\nIf the things had been turned around and it happened on my time, OP, you can be sure that I would have dad up there waiting with me even though we were not too comfortable in each other's company.  It was his son too.", "OP, you are directly affecting the relationship between your son and his father. This is such a horrible thing to do. Shame on you.

It doesn\u2019t matter how bitter your divorce was or what your husband did to you to cause you to split up in this situation - preventing someone from seeing their child is wrong and for all you know your son subtlety resents your ex for it just because you were using your son to get back at your ex.  You should consider yourself lucky you had a partner that is willing to be there for your child at all considering how many parents don\u2019t care.

We divorced a little less than a year ago after some actions on his part, he was with another woman. I got majority custody, he gets to see him every other weekend. My lawyer advised me not to allow my ex to have any contact whatsoever with my son outside of custody time, as he could use that to get more for himself.\n\nAnyway a month ago, my son got appendicitis and spent three days in the hospital, it was very routine, he was never in any real danger. My ex wanted to visit him, but I reminded him that it wasn't his custody time, and he had no right to do that. I did eventually allow a short phonecall, both because my son had been asking, and because my ex was threatening to get the courts involved.\n\nMy son is fine now, and he's practically forgotten it ever happened. My ex however has been hounding my lawyer, saying that he has the right to visit my son when he's sick. I expected most people to be on my side after how our marriage ended, but most people have been saying I was cruel. Even my divorced friends said they would've let him come. But I donmt want him having any excuse to take my son away from me more than he already does, or allow him to weasel his way out of child support.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You worried you might get less child support or just want to screw him over because you are bitter? Both? \nMy ex and I divorced when our daughter was 3. Did I like him.. no!

Why are you trying to limit your child from seeing his dad outside of EOW? You mention nothing of him being a bad dad just a bad husband. Nobody is on your side, is my bigger bet.
