We divorced a little less than a year ago after some actions on his part, he was with another woman. I got majority custody, he gets to see him every other weekend. My lawyer advised me not to allow my ex to have any contact whatsoever with my son outside of custody time, as he could use that to get more for himself.\n\nAnyway a month ago, my son got appendicitis and spent three days in the hospital, it was very routine, he was never in any real danger. My ex wanted to visit him, but I reminded him that it wasn't his custody time, and he had no right to do that. I did eventually allow a short phonecall, both because my son had been asking, and because my ex was threatening to get the courts involved.\n\nMy son is fine now, and he's practically forgotten it ever happened. My ex however has been hounding my lawyer, saying that he has the right to visit my son when he's sick. I expected most people to be on my side after how our marriage ended, but most people have been saying I was cruel. Even my divorced friends said they would've let him come. But I donmt want him having any excuse to take my son away from me more than he already does, or allow him to weasel his way out of child support.", "created_utc": 1687041051, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14c3sgx/aita_for_not_letting_my_exhusband_visit_our_son/", "score": 1787, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which after what you just pulled if it does ever happen he won't be at all inclined to let you visit him. What happens when important occasions happen when it's dad's time?

Honestly you just gift wrapped him a very sympathetic reason for the court to give him additional time, if not out right custody. Of course, we don\u2019t know the back story, but on the surface this is going to come across as petty and vindictive, even cruel. Your son was sick and wanted his dad. You wanted to be right.

The thought of him made me sick. \n\nBut I sucked it up, and was kind to him. Not just kind, but understanding and empathetic. I checked on him, while raising his child by myself and running myself into the ground. It was so ridiculous, because no one was checking on me, and I was the one dealing with everything. But cussing him out and telling him what a loser he is wasn\u2019t Going to be what convinced him to step up and be a good dad. So I tried to kill him with kindness and I did for an entire year. \n\nDid he deserve that grace as my ex-fianc\u00e9? Absolutely not. \n\nDoes my daughters father deserve that grace? For the sake of my child, he absolutely does. \n\nAnd it worked. I had to eat shit and bear it for a few months, and swallow my pride time and time again. But I reminded myself that it\u2019s not about me. And when all is said and done, I want to be able to tell my child I tried my absolute best to facilitate the relationship between her and her dad. And yeah he came around(kinda), and he\u2019s a fantastic dad when he shows up. But he doesn\u2019t show up very often. And my daughter asks for her dad way more often than her dad actually comes. I would do ANYTHING for her to have a father who fought to see her. \n\nSo stories like yours make me sick, because you just don\u2019t get it.

They would take turns usually and not be in the room together but even with all that she never ever would\u2019ve considered blocking him. And for us, hospital stays were pretty normal. Little brother has a rare disease so it was our norm. For a not normal situation it\u2019s even more ridiculous to me to block the other parent because it\u2019s not their day - that\u2019s for actual custody, not visits.

Him just *seeing and speaking* with your son doesn't mean son isn't currently in your custody.

Him saying he got to see him ONE extra day jn court wouldn't have changed a damn thing. You basically screwed yourself at this point for denying him to see him AT THE HOSPITAL.

Having both parents there to support him would have been the best thing *for him*.\n\nHave you lost sight of that? Your obligation as a parent is to do what's best for your child.

I do hope dad takes your bum back to court and lays it on thick how you REFUSED HIM TO SEE HIS SICK CHILD!!!!\n\nAdditional: At 12 or 13, my son came down with appendix issues one weekend.  His dad and step mom and the family with him went to hike at a local park.  He got a stitch in the side that was really annoying him.  By the following Wednesday, he was not feeling so good and they took him to ER and called me as I was just getting to church to have the evening meal and study time and had taken my niece.  (For context: Dad and I agreed out of court over custody--he had primary physical for school and we shared 50/50 legal custody for decisions.)  They told me they would call me later to let me know if the doctors were sure on it being his appendix.  I told them no way was I going to sit back and wait and I would be up.  I sent my niece home with my parents and let my sister know and went to the hospital.  I got there and son was in a room with his dad and step mom waiting for a CAT scan to come back.  It was positive for appendix being bad.  His dad did not tell me I could not come or be there.  He did not like me anymore and had been hateful a lot before this happened.  We sat there for a bit and the surgeon came out and told us that it would take an hour for the operation and they would let us know how things went.  Shortly, my ex and his wife had people coming out of the cracks and crevices to pray with them and sit with them.  I sat by myself for that hour across the way from them. None of them came over to see if I needed someone to talk to or pray with or what have you.  After a long hour of worry, son came out of surgery fine and all had gone well.  It was a relief.  Once he was in a room on the PEDs floor, his dad and step mom had to go home to the other kids (step sibs) because there was no one home. I called work and let them know what happened and I would not be in the next day to work.  I stayed all night at the hospital with my son so someone was there with him.  And he admitted to me he wanted me there more than anyone.  \n\nIf the things had been turned around and it happened on my time, OP, you can be sure that I would have dad up there waiting with me even though we were not too comfortable in each other's company.  It was his son too.", "OP, you are directly affecting the relationship between your son and his father. This is such a horrible thing to do. Shame on you.

It doesn\u2019t matter how bitter your divorce was or what your husband did to you to cause you to split up in this situation - preventing someone from seeing their child is wrong and for all you know your son subtlety resents your ex for it just because you were using your son to get back at your ex.  You should consider yourself lucky you had a partner that is willing to be there for your child at all considering how many parents don\u2019t care.

We divorced a little less than a year ago after some actions on his part, he was with another woman. I got majority custody, he gets to see him every other weekend. My lawyer advised me not to allow my ex to have any contact whatsoever with my son outside of custody time, as he could use that to get more for himself.\n\nAnyway a month ago, my son got appendicitis and spent three days in the hospital, it was very routine, he was never in any real danger. My ex wanted to visit him, but I reminded him that it wasn't his custody time, and he had no right to do that. I did eventually allow a short phonecall, both because my son had been asking, and because my ex was threatening to get the courts involved.\n\nMy son is fine now, and he's practically forgotten it ever happened. My ex however has been hounding my lawyer, saying that he has the right to visit my son when he's sick. I expected most people to be on my side after how our marriage ended, but most people have been saying I was cruel. Even my divorced friends said they would've let him come. But I donmt want him having any excuse to take my son away from me more than he already does, or allow him to weasel his way out of child support.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You worried you might get less child support or just want to screw him over because you are bitter? Both? \nMy ex and I divorced when our daughter was 3. Did I like him.. no!

Why are you trying to limit your child from seeing his dad outside of EOW? You mention nothing of him being a bad dad just a bad husband. Nobody is on your side, is my bigger bet.

And I'm not sure if infidelity by itself is enough for a lawyer to decide it's okay to prevent a kid from seeing their parent.", "The advice was probably quite different as no decent lawyer is going to advise something like this.", "I read that and jumped straight to, \u201dshe heard what she wanted to hear\u201d from her lawyers whole spiel.", "I\u2019m a family law attorney, I don\u2019t  believe for a minute they said that", "Yeah I caught that too - my sick child has been in the hospital asking to see his father but no way am I risking not getting every dime possible out of that man OP is sooooo TA", "Alienation of affection is for spouses- not children.", "Yes, he did. I divorced my kids' father when the kids were four and two, and getting a parenting evaluation was part of the divorce process. After interviewing both of us, spending time with our children, and talking to some people who knew us both, the evaluator wrote, among other things, \"Both of these parents consistently prioritize their children's well being over their disagreements with each other. I am not sure that either of them realizes how unusual this is.\"\n\nShe was right. We didn't grasp how unusual it was, at the time. We just knew that our kids were the most important thing in the world to each of us, and if working together was the way to ensure they were best treated, then we'd work together. I always *knew* that I could trust him to prioritize the kids' needs over his own desires, and so even when we argued about what was actually in the kids' best interests, I knew that if I could convince them of that, he would go along with it. Because if it was in the kids' best interests, then it should happen, period, as far as either of us are concerned. \n\nBy now, the kids are 19 and 17, and we still -- together with his wife and my husband -- work together to do whatever is in the kids' best interests. We even get along well these days... we'll never be interested in each other romantically again, but we're all collectively friends of a kind. When the pandemic kept us from seeing anyone outside our own bubble, we made a bubble of the two combined households so our kids could continue going back and forth every week safely, and as long as we had that, we kept up something of a social life with them, inviting them over for summer barbecues in the yard and that kind of thing. \n\nMost of all, I can trust them to take good care of my kids when the kids are at their place, and work together with me when we need to about them. That's worth everything to me. It's helped the kids grow up with very minimal divorce trauma.\n\nI wish OP's son the same kind of environment, even though I don't think it likely right now.", "I know, crazy. I\u2019m 31 now and I think I still have the record at that particular hospital for being the youngest ever patient to undergo that procedure. Even that young, I remember waking up that morning and the immense pain in my side. And feeling really really hot, which I guess was the fever. The air in the mask they put on me for the anesthesia smelled good. And then I woke up and there was a picture of Donald Duck on the wall in the kids\u2019 ward. Fun times \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, they don't mess around with parental alienation.  Not letting him have the kid on her days?  Sure.  But not allowing any contact and keeping him away while in the hospital is not going to help her.", "My husband had appendicitis and spent 8 weeks in hospital.", "Not to mention, a small percentage of people with appendicitis die.  Usually, it affects the young and elderly.", "That was my thought, too!", "And 3 days in the hospital with appendicitis is not nothing. In an uncomplicated case you can be out of the hospital the same day you had it removed.", "As a lawyer, yes. I can't tell you the number of times I've seen a well-meaning person do something seemingly messed up because they took legal advice too literally and rigidly. They felt compelled to obey their lawyer's instructions despite feeling fraught about it, like the legal advice equivalent of the Milgram experiment.\n\nThe law is generally highly complex and nuanced, with exceptions, exceptions to the exceptions and exceptions to the exceptions to the exceptions. Oftentimes, the hard-and-fast, \"black and white\" rules (when it comes to substance, not procedure) are the proverbial box outside of which one must sometimes think. That's what lawyers are paid to do.\n\nNot allowing her son to see the ex outside normal custody time likely meant not allowing him to stay *over at the ex's home* for extended periods, because the ex might try to petition for a change in the order based on a change in circumstances (custody has changed in fact, and the order should reflect the reality). It almost certainly did not mean the ex coming to see the son in the hospital, which wouldn't entitle him to any sort of change in custody or credit toward child support.\n\nThis does not mean ignore your lawyer's advice based on your own gut instinct! It means if your lawyer tells you to not do XYZ or to always do XYZ, make sure you understand the rationale. If there's any doubt as to whether the rationale applies in this particular circumstance, please, please, check in with the lawyer to make sure you've understood.", "Nah op totally knew what she was doing and is doing this out of spite by weaponising the child. Happens quite a lot in custody battles.", "I think the OP is petty and just using her child as a weapon to punish the ex. I can't fathom my sick child asking for his father and me being that vindictive. I fully understand being angry at him for being a crappy husband, but don't punish your child who obviously loves his dad.", "I don't understand this. Even if she is present, allowing him to see their son during her time (while healthy) could affect custody? I could see it if she was leaving him with his dad all the time to go do something else, but wouldn't her presence make it just a visit?", "It sounds like his \u201cdid something horrible\u201d was cheating on OP.  Now I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, but it\u2019s between her and him, the child shouldn\u2019t be put in the middle.  Although given how vindictive she is, I no longer feel bad for her.  She\u2019s probably awful to live with.  YTA.  Grow up OP.  It\u2019s a divorce.  Happens to lots of people.  Eventually your child will be old enough to decide who he wants to live with and my spider senses are telling me it won\u2019t be you.", "Doesnt make it right.", "Lawyer here\u2014bingo.  In fact, letting the other parent see the child at additional times, actually helps her case for no changes to custody/parenting time because it shows that she has flexibility and is open to additional time without it having to be structured or court ordered.", "Parental alienation ~my bad.", "Exactly. I think OP heard half of what the attorney said (don't pawn the kid off on dad when it's your custody time, that looks bad) but filled in the rest with her own agenda. I really feel for the child, OP is understandably hurt that her husband cheated but she needs to realize that doesn't give her a free pass to hurt him however she wants (especially when it's at her child's expense)", "Me too and I still suffer with complications 30 years later.", "Exactly. You catch it early enough and it\u2019s usually an outpatient procedure", "As an attorney this is exactly what happened!", "In my opinion the lawyer's advice was just being used to justify her appalling behavior to herself. \n(Conjecture, objection, etc!)", "Oh yea, just given her statement alone about how it wasn't on his time spoke volumes as to what she was trying to do. OP is majorly TA for that. Adding on the fact that her child was literally asking for his dad just makes it even worse.", ">Happens quite a lot in custody battles.\n\nI was the kid in this situation, so believe me, I KNOW. That's why I said she should go back to her lawyer because if she doesn't, EXHB will, and he will have grounds for more custody.", "Depends on the case. In some cases, it is 100% right to keep the contact to a bare minimum. My cousins father is an abusive drunk who was prepared to use his then 8 year old to get my mom in trouble for taking custody of him. Contact was extremely limited to avoid that and all contact had to be monitored.\n\nThis case it just sounds like OP wants to spite her ex as much as she can and is willing to use her kid to do it.", "Yep. Me too. She is on a fast track to a modification.", "I'm concerned about the statement that her son hardly remembers anything about it (paraphrase). I was just talking with my 80+ yr old mom about a traumatic experience I had when I was 4. She couldn't believe I remembered. Pain is a great reminder.", "EXHB should get more custody after her AH behaviour", "Right? The guy cheated. It sucks, but I fail to see why that would be a reason to not let him see his son in the hospital? If her ex had abused their son, it would be absolutely right to stop him from talking or seeing the child.", "I wish reddit would keep the conversation relevent to the op. Ywah no shit every situation is different. No fucking shit.", "Made even more traumatic by the fact that she denied access to his dad. \n\nI remember things from childhood (beyond childhood trauma from growing up in an abusive home), and my mom is shocked when I tell her things that she didn't think mattered. I gave up telling her anything more about my childhood when she kept claiming, \"I don't remember that\""]}
