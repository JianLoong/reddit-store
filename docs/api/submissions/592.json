To clarify Sarah and Steve are not close friends, they see each other on occasion at events but do not meet up outside of those nor do they even talk regularly. She has even said to me before she doesn\u2019t consider him a friend so I don\u2019t understand why he was invited in the first place. She said she felt awkward not inviting him.

It\u2019s clear you are in the wrong by the way your friends have handled the situation. Maybe Steve\u2019s girl was the first was brave enough so call you out and you can\u2019t handle it", "YTA\n\nSarah gets to invite whoever she wants to her party. Your role is to decide whether or not to attend. You simply tell her whether or not you plan to attend. Period.\n\nAlso--Steve will continue to exist even though you aren't friends. You will run into him at all the usual places. Are you planning to snub him forever or be a grown up and be civil to him in public? The fact that he's present at a party doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At the end of the day it was Sarah\u2019s choice but I think she should have considered your feelings in the matter since he wasn\u2019t very kind to you.", "Steve\u2019s partner didn\u2019t actually call me out on anything. He has made fun of my appearance, has fat shamed me to my face, called me \u2018insane\u2019 because I regularly go to therapy because it works for me. He has also referred my family as scum because of the area they\u2019re from.", "Im not sure of you\u2019re reasoning as to why I\u2019m TA. As you said Sarah can invite who she wants and it\u2019s my decision to go or not. \nRegarding your second point, I have no reason to speak to him anymore, he hasn\u2019t apologised for anything that he\u2019s done and doesn\u2019t see an issue with how he\u2019s treated me hence why I didn\u2019t want to attend. From past events I also know his partner would inevitably say something to me in a negative way so I think trying to enjoy an event where they attend isn\u2019t really a possibility.", "Thank you!", "There's no reason to tell your friend you feel let down, etc... Tell her something came up, or if you're close enough to be honest, tell her you know it won't be fun to be around the ex. But expecting her to build a social life that meets your needs isn't fair."]}
