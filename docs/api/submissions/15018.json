I recently retired from a job  of 30 years where I basically worked the same way as OP.

It came partly from how they were raised and partly out of concern that I would develop good work habits as an adult. But in retrospect I'm not sure if it would have even been legal for me to work younger than that. My parents grew up with different conditions, for example they didn't have homework as kids which made it easier to work while in school.  \nIt's also pretty common for non-academic parents to view graduate school as not a \"real\" job even though doing a phd ime is more stressful and longer hours than most things parents think of as real jobs.\n\nAnyway it sounds like OP has her life in a good place, has a good work-life balance, and should be commended for how efficiently she finishes projects.
