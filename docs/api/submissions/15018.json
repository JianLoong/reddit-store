Then you would be seen as the overachiever!\"  And I tell her that sometimes I do, but other times I just don't feel like it.

But still, the mother has to find a way to criticize. My experience was that I was an adult literacy teacher, but my neighbor was a \"real\" teacher.", "NTA.

I recently retired from a job  of 30 years where I basically worked the same way as OP.  Some days I barely took time to go to the bathroom or grabbed a snack, other days I read fan fiction on the web between meetings. It worked for me but it was hard to explain to someone who had a more structured job, so I stopped trying. \n\nWhat I had a hard time explaining is that even when I was goofing off my mind was still processing work related stuff, and I really didn't have much extra CPU to handle extra assignments.

The comments are not outwardly negative when it comes to your performance but stem from the cancerous hustle & overtime culture which she has probably experienced first hand and is just worried for you. It doesn't seem like you guys ever had a conversation where you explained why those comments are outdated and incorrect, and she bases them off of her experience that was relevant at the time. \n\nI also don't think you're an asshole, since I kind of do the same thing with my mom or grandparents lol.\n\nBut if you do have a calm conversation about it, you decide to share again and she continues doing it... yeah no, then NTA.", "NTA. \nToxic mom. Good for you for setting boundaries.", "NTA   She sounds like she's a little jealous.", "NTA", "NTA. The 'excuse me for having opinions' is a little narcissistic. Remind her that it's a brave new world out there. Explain to her how the 9-5 working day was created at a time where men worked and women stayed at home tending to the house. Now all genders are expected to do both during the same timeframe. Tell her that creating a healthy work/life balance for employees actually often results in a healthy ROI.", "No don\u2019t feel bad", "I go around telling people that their opinions of me are irrelevant (usually while they're in the heat of giving unsolicited opinions). It makes the opinions stop after they deal with the shock of the reality that their opinions are worth less than dog \ud83d\udca9 \n\nIt's equal opportunity for anybody except my immediate household lol.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nThings don't work like they did back in your mother's day and she's refusing to accept that. She doesn't understand that people typically need to change companies to get a big pay bump and promotion and that taking on a lot of extra responsibilities doesn't pay off these days unless you can use the experience to improve your resume so you're more attractive to your next employer.\n\nI'm old enough that I got my first few jobs just walking in the door and asking for a job.  Your mom probably still thinks that works for all jobs rather than a select few industries like independent restaurants.", "NTA  Your mom does not need to reiterate her opinions.  She is trying to make you feel bad and doing more work really doesn't do anything except label one as a sucker.", "Oh yeah, I think they are very happy with me.  I got a promotion a year ago, so I assume that I'm doing something right lol.\n\nAnd, I think my tone was civil.  I basically just stated it as a fact, I wasn't angry or anything."]}
