Our hearts were broken and since then, we\u2019ve wanted nothing less than to become parents and have something to call our own. \n\nLast year, we decided we would volunteer helping at foster homes and helping the youth and young adults that were struggling with homelessness. While doing this, we met our sons birth mother (A) 19F. She was pregnant and struggling with homelessness and we offered to take her in, help her with maternity clothes, healthcare, transportation with doctors appointments etc. She took us up on our offer and moved in, and thats when she began telling us that her child\u2019s father wasn\u2019t in the picture and she had no way to provide for him. She didn\u2019t know what she was going to do and had no job or way of caring for him. She was 20 weeks pregnant around this time. \n\nAs our bond grew, we told her our struggles with having a child of our own and told her that it would mean the world to us to have a child as we are financially stable and a loving family. We offered to adopt him and have her be a sister figure to him, we told her that this was completely her decision and that we would support whatever she wanted. After a few weeks, she told us that she wanted us to adopt him once she gave birth and we agreed to an open adoption. We thanked her, and we supported her in every way she needed and she also had her own room in our home. \n\nFast forward, she gave birth to our son, Aiden. I was there for the birth and our bond was unexplainable. Shortly after, the next morning she signed off the adoption papers and terminated her rights. We then took him home along with her. About 2 weeks after his birth, she began becoming very clingy with our son. We explained that he was ours and she was welcome to help with him, but he was my son and I would make all decisions regarding him. This upset her, and she felt hurt, so we ultimately decided to ask her to move out and once the adoption was finalized, we haven\u2019t had any contact with her since. We decided to close the adoption and we asked her not to contact us any further. \n\nHis birth mother thinks I\u2019m the AH, and accuses me of manipulating her with false pretenses however this is not true and aiden is our son and I am his mother so I have to do what\u2019s best for him.

It sounds like none of you had realistic expectations about how all this would work, but she's 19 and you're 37, so the onus is on you.  I'm not buying the \"it just sort of happened\" story.  After you found out you couldn't have a baby biologically, you just happened to start working with foster teens - teens who are often at risk for pregnancy and who are very vulnerable emotionally and financially.  You were baby shopping.  When you found the opportunity, you took in a vulnerable 19 year old girl, and gave her kindness and affection that she may never have had before, convinced her to let you adopt her baby by telling her that she could still have a place in the baby's life.  Then she actually has the baby, and has a much bigger biological and hormonal tie than she expects.  You don't want this because your incubator has become inconvenient, so you kick her out.  On what planet is this okay?!\n\nAdoption is a fraught and difficult process at the best of times, and can go horribly, horribly wrong, but it can also work out well when bio-parents and adoptive parents are in agreement - **real** agreement.  That's not what happened here, and it will taint everything you do for the rest of this child's life.  This was horrendously selfish of you, and you put your own wants ahead of bio-mom's AND baby's.  You wanted a child and couldn't have one, so you put a lot of effort into manipulating a vulnerable girl into giving you hers.  You manipulated this girl, acted as if you cared for her, when you were really just using her.  You made the agreement about an open adoption under false pretenses, and then reneged now that it's no longer convenient.  And now you're trying to hide behind \"it's the best thing for the baby.\"  By that yardstick, we should just screen every bio parent to make sure that there isn't a better parent out there, and just give the newborn to the \"best\" parent.  Ultimately, from an economic and stability standpoint, this might be the best of bad choices for this kid, but that's not the point.\n\nYou now have a problem about what to tell this child. You can try to whitewash this, and either not tell him he was adopted at all, or paint yourselves as heroes, and tell him that his bio-mother didn't want him or that she couldn't take care of him or that she was an awful person and what you did \"was for the best.\"  But he's going to want to find out about his bio-mom, (and he probably will DNA tests being what they are these days, and they'll be even better in 18 years).  Then he's going to talk to her or her family, and hear their side, and you are going to have a very upset and very troubled adolescent or young adult who isn't going to trust anybody, especially you, because you lied to him and to his bio-mother about some very, very fundamental things.", "YTA - you took advantage of a  vulnerable woman and stole her child. The fact you are now CHOOSING to deny your kid a relationship with his biological mother is criminal in my opinion and tells me you have done absolutely none of this with the baby\u2019s best interest in mind, only your own selfish wants.", "You're a disgrace.

Our hearts were broken and since then, we\u2019ve wanted nothing less than to become parents and have something to call our own. \n\nLast year, we decided we would volunteer helping at foster homes and helping the youth and young adults that were struggling with homelessness. While doing this, we met our sons birth mother (A) 19F. She was pregnant and struggling with homelessness and we offered to take her in, help her with maternity clothes, healthcare, transportation with doctors appointments etc. She took us up on our offer and moved in, and thats when she began telling us that her child\u2019s father wasn\u2019t in the picture and she had no way to provide for him. She didn\u2019t know what she was going to do and had no job or way of caring for him. She was 20 weeks pregnant around this time. \n\nAs our bond grew, we told her our struggles with having a child of our own and told her that it would mean the world to us to have a child as we are financially stable and a loving family. We offered to adopt him and have her be a sister figure to him, we told her that this was completely her decision and that we would support whatever she wanted. After a few weeks, she told us that she wanted us to adopt him once she gave birth and we agreed to an open adoption. We thanked her, and we supported her in every way she needed and she also had her own room in our home. \n\nFast forward, she gave birth to our son, Aiden. I was there for the birth and our bond was unexplainable. Shortly after, the next morning she signed off the adoption papers and terminated her rights. We then took him home along with her. About 2 weeks after his birth, she began becoming very clingy with our son. We explained that he was ours and she was welcome to help with him, but he was my son and I would make all decisions regarding him. This upset her, and she felt hurt, so we ultimately decided to ask her to move out and once the adoption was finalized, we haven\u2019t had any contact with her since. We decided to close the adoption and we asked her not to contact us any further. \n\nHis birth mother thinks I\u2019m the AH, and accuses me of manipulating her with false pretenses however this is not true and aiden is our son and I am his mother so I have to do what\u2019s best for him.

This was not a good decision for her to make during such a vulnerable period. \n\nThen you kicked her out once she did the natural thing and started getting attached to her child because you wanted to have that attachment alone.

She\u2019s not abusive, she\u2019s not on drugs, she\u2019s just young and having a hard time, as many successful mothers do. Nothing here makes her unfit to parent. OP exploited a teenager and somehow she\u2019s the more fit parent because she has money and a husband? You need to examine that worldview. It\u2019s honestly horrifying and scary.", ">by the way closed adoptions fuck the child up\n\nYou quite literally did. If you'd said like, \"by the way closed adoptions ***can*** fuck the child up,\" it would have a different meaning, but you did make a sweeping generalization.", "Stop.  I\u2019m a closed adoption and you don\u2019t speak for me.", "The state decides who has the right to their child and who doesn\u2019t.  This young woman is certainly a good candidate for a loss of parental rights."]}
