I mean, I don't really like the word \"normal\" but I would say it is always foolish to spend money that you don't yet have. If word of his big mouth got back to some of these relatives, with the way he is talking so gleefully about the fruits of their demise, they might well rethink his place in the will... but it's just a bit ghoulish beyond that. I may well have some money coming to me some day (not second-house money) and I can't say I've ever thought about or discussed it in that way. That's just me though. I do not think you are out of line for feeling this is inappropriate. If you actually brought the issue to him in the way that you presented it here, then I don't believe you've done anything wrong and if anything, by his reaction it sounds like you may have struck a nerve.\n\nSome people think it's gauche to talk about money in general but that's not the problem here. I agree with you that gleefully and excitedly talking about future purchases to be made as a direct result of the passing of a loved one is disrespectful at best. The main pitfall would be approaching the conversation afterwards indelicately, but it doesn't sound like that was the case.", "NTA, he was being tacky.", "NTA. I think many people would consider it offensive to hear the enthusiasm and excitement with which your husband talks openly about his future inheritance.

And definitely not in the way your husband did it.  I doubt he means any disrespect to his family, but it can come off as if he cares more about the money.\n\nAlso, lots of things can happen between now and the time that your husband's inheritance is paid out to him.  Long-term illness, economic downturns, etc., can all take a toll on savings and investments.  Better not to boast about it now in the event that his family fortunes are reversed in the future.", "NTA \n\nNot only is it tacky for him to talk about inheritance outside of family situations, it's also really presumptuous. \n\nUntil he has the money in hand there is always a chance he won't get anything, and that would have him looking like an even bigger fool in the long run.

Sure, it\u2019s fine to talk about it with those that will be leaving the assets\u2014but the important conversations are had with those you\u2019ll be sharing them with.

We need to normalize talking about estate planning in a sensitive and compassionate way. It sounds like OP doesn't want to talk about estate planning at all, and husband is being insensitive and lacking in compassion. We have a cultural taboo against talking about death with our loved ones, and while it's hard, we really need to find ways to do it.\n\nEveryone with children, whether they are rich or poor, young or old, should make a solid and thoughtful plan for both end of life care and what to do with their estate after their death. And absolutely everyone needs to have a healthcare proxy.\n\nAs a nurse, I have taken care of patients at the end of their lives, including young patients who seemed otherwise healthy and had massive strokes. I've seen patients' families do things I know for sure would be against the patients' wishes, but without a healthcare proxy the family makes the decisions. (For example, I've seen the family of a trans patient aggressively misgendering and deadnaming their family member.) Everyone should have a health care proxy form on file with their doctor and hospital system, and everyone needs to talk about what they want with their loved ones. Have the conversation while you're healthy. Don't wait until it's too late.", "NTA\n\nI'm with you, it's incredibly creepy and actually pretty disrespectful to his parents.

This isn't about how much you stand to gain from when you lose your parents as your husband so coldly put it. It's about how it seems like he CAN'T WAIT for them to pass away. It's disturbing and totally not something a normal personal discusses like this. \n\nIt is normal to talk about what will happen to your parents' estate prior to death, but it is in a tying up lose ends kind of mindset to makes the transition easy as possible to to ensure everything is divided the way your parents wished for it to. Your husband is making this seem like an exciting gift he is waiting on. \n\nHonestly, if I got wind of my children talking that way about what would happen to my stuff before I passed away, I'd likely see to it that they got nothing.

I'd say it's cultural differences. My mum just had the absolute worst inheritance battle with her brothers that spanned over 2 years and it completely changed everything.

My siblings and I have have had discussions with my Mom (last remaining parent) involved, and its a heathy thing from our perspective.

A million things could happen that mean \"no more lake house\" and your husband should count himself lucky he married someone with common sense and decorum.", "NTA.", "It's a close one, but I'm going to go with nah and it might border into yta depending on how you had this conversation.\n\nFirst, I think that Reddit just happens to be on your side in this whole debate, but I don't think that means you're automatically nta. This sub has devolved a bit into \"who is correct,\" which is, ironically, a much more subjective test than \"who was the asshole.\" Who is the asshole accounts for differences of opinion. Just because you think something is uncouth or tacky or, to your ear, suggests that someone is greedy or doesn't love their family, that doesn't mean your view is objective fact. Plenty of families openly discuss end of life planning and it doesn't mean that the relationship is any less caring or more transactional.\n\nAs an example, my FIL has left a boat for my wife, and they discuss it somewhat frequently. And my wife mentions it frequently. It's not because she's hoping he'll kick off so she can get the boat. It's because she cherishes the time she has spent, and continues to spend, with him in their shared activity on that boat. And the fact that he has left it to her tells her that he feels the same. To some people, an inheritance is a sense of pride, because, as others have said, it can be taken away.  It is the promise itself, and the meaning behind that promise, that some people are proud of. And that's not the only reason why someone might discuss an inheritance, it's just one reason.\n\nMy point is that, just because you interpret a scenario one way, it's doesn't mean that your way is correct, and I'm not sure that you have a monopoly on social mores here. It seems like your husband only did this with his other family members and, on one occasion, with a group of friends. So he's not just putting this out into the world all the time. And this context should frame the discussion you had with him.\n\nFirst, I think any discussion of his conversation with his family needed to come from a position of understanding. Why does his family do this? What are the feelings that motivate this? Even if you disagree with him, I don't think you should approach an apparently kind of deep-rooted family trait with accusations out of the gate. \n\nEventually you can say something about how it might come off to other people, which leads me to the friends discussion. How did the friends react? Was it awkward out of the gate? How much of your perceived awkwardness was because you personally don't like it and how much actual? How did you specifically approach the subject? Again, this isn't really something with a clear right or wrong answer (outside of Reddit). I'm not saying you definitely approached it insensitively, but if you just started talking about how weird it was that he talked so openly about this, I could see him feeling attacked by your views.", "NTA.

I don't want to think about my parents death or benefiting from it. I remind my mom that I'm grateful most for all she gave us during her life, anything she leaves behind is a nice gift from her but it's unnecessary and I wouldn't be the least bit upset if she spent every last dime living it up until the end, after all she worked for it.

I was understandably a little upset.   She essentially told me she was just kidding, no need to get upset.  \n\nLast year, 30+ years later, I got a Facebook  request/message from her, apologizing for her comment.
