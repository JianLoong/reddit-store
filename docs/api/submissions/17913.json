My biggest hope for my parents is that they live long enough to spend everything they have. How can you be excited for an inheritance when it means someone you love will no longer be alive?

But I would have a problem with saying that for a different reason: He is counting his chickens before they hatch. And tempting providence.\n\nBut that doesnt detract at all from your valid points. \"I cant wait will they die! Death jackpot!\" isnt a very dignified thing to broadcast.", "NTA.  There are several reasons not to talk about a future inheritance\n\n* It may not happen - there are no guarantees until it actually happens\n* It could make him a target for opportunists or other bad actors, depending on how large the inheritance is\n* It can cause jealousy and resentment with friends and family\n* It's tacky - yes that's subjective but anything that even seems like bragging about money is something I would avoid", "NTA. Make sure if they die under suspicious circumstances to have the police look at your husband and the cousins first. \ud83d\udc40", "NTA. I mean, I don't really like the word \"normal\" but I would say it is always foolish to spend money that you don't yet have. If word of his big mouth got back to some of these relatives, with the way he is talking so gleefully about the fruits of their demise, they might well rethink his place in the will... but it's just a bit ghoulish beyond that. I may well have some money coming to me some day (not second-house money) and I can't say I've ever thought about or discussed it in that way. That's just me though. I do not think you are out of line for feeling this is inappropriate. If you actually brought the issue to him in the way that you presented it here, then I don't believe you've done anything wrong and if anything, by his reaction it sounds like you may have struck a nerve.\n\nSome people think it's gauche to talk about money in general but that's not the problem here. I agree with you that gleefully and excitedly talking about future purchases to be made as a direct result of the passing of a loved one is disrespectful at best. The main pitfall would be approaching the conversation afterwards indelicately, but it doesn't sound like that was the case.", "NTA, he was being tacky.", "NTA. I think many people would consider it offensive to hear the enthusiasm and excitement with which your husband talks openly about his future inheritance. It's like he's decoupled the fact that for him to receive that benefit, loved ones will have died, and that is an insensitive approach. Talking privately, wanting to understand logistics, etc. may be acceptable in his family, but even that would make some people very uncomfortable.", "NTA. One of my sets of grandparents has been very proactive in estate planning and how things will be divided up so that everyone is treated fairly. And that's fine because even though it's an unpleasant topic, it's a necessary thing. \n\nBut even in knowing the value of what we could stand to gain after their demise feels kind of gross (in my opinion), like the value is more on the money than the people. \n\nSo from my perspective at least, I think you're in the right and that it is disrespectful to talk about that type of thing.  Like, the attitude of \"I would have this amount of money or this asset if X would just go ahead and die already\" is super gross.", "NTA.\n\nI agree that it's tacky to talk about your possible inheritance and what you plan to do with the money.  It's also boastful/bragging - \"I'll be so rich in the future I can buy whatever I want!\"  \n\nMaybe his family talks openly about such things, but it's really a family matter, not for discussion with friends.  And definitely not in the way your husband did it.  I doubt he means any disrespect to his family, but it can come off as if he cares more about the money.\n\nAlso, lots of things can happen between now and the time that your husband's inheritance is paid out to him.  Long-term illness, economic downturns, etc., can all take a toll on savings and investments.  Better not to boast about it now in the event that his family fortunes are reversed in the future.", "NTA \n\nNot only is it tacky for him to talk about inheritance outside of family situations, it's also really presumptuous. \n\nUntil he has the money in hand there is always a chance he won't get anything, and that would have him looking like an even bigger fool in the long run. Hell he might even be cut out  if they heard him talking out it as he is.", "As someone who expects to receive an inheritance, I can safely say that it's not something to talk about so casually.\n\nI can foresee us having a meeting when we are 60 with the kids and their spouses to say *\"these are our current holdings. If we died, you would get about \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ each. Maybe in 5 years we'll have another meeting to let you know how it changes.\"*", "NTA - hubby is tacky.  Talking about money in general is pretty classless IMO.", "NTA. Unless it\u2019s brought up by the people he will be inheriting *from* or as an idle one off, this isn\u2019t appropriate. It\u2019s something that will only happen if one of his relatives dies! He needs to be aware that people can and will judge him and find it gross, greedy and disrespectful.", ">He flipped out, basically told me that since I don't stand to gain anything from my parents, I don't really understand that it's normal to talk about these things.\n\nUm.. while it may be normal to talk about those things when the time comes, it is not normal to talk about inheritance in that way. That's how a greedy person talks about it, which is obviously in bad taste.\n\nNTA.", "It\u2019s not that normal.  NTA.    It\u2019srude and insensitive in my opinion. \n\nAlso there\u2019s the whole \u201cdon\u2019t count your chickens before they hatch\u201d saying.

He can be like, \"If jujubeamz fell off this boat and drowned right now, I'd buy a boat like that one!!!\"", "NTA. It's totally tacky. Love your parents when they're here. Make your own money instead of waiting for them to die.   \n\n\nAs someone who received a large inheritance, let me tell you it does not solve all your problems or lead to happiness.", "NTA - tone is everything, if he humbly said he was lucky his parents set him up well, once? Ok fine I'd let it be.\n\nBut to keep talking about it constantly? To not respect that this is an outcome of their death and discuss it with the appropriate tone it needs? Yeah it's disrespectful. \n\nHe's not 18 years old with their death being so far in the future that you're emotionally distant. He's old enough to know better!\n\nWhen he brings it up again, remind him that *he* could be the one dying tomorrow, inheritance becoming a complete non-issue for him, and to hush.", "It's one thing to discuss end of life matters in private among the affected parties...but it is another to brag to friends.  \n\nNTA", "NTA big time. My parents and I joke about inheritance (if they give me a lot of money it's \"well you'll get the money now or later, might as well be now\" or \"I can't believe you're spending my inheritance on a big vacation without me!\" all completely in jest) but in reality I hope they're around forever and I could never talk about it like that.

That's disgusting. I tell my parents to blow the lot, live their lives, spend the money they earned, and have a blast doing it. I can't bear the thought of losing my family, let alone be thinking about how i'd send their cash.", "NTA it is NOT normal to talk about an inheritance BEFORE people fucking die unless its in a lawyers pffice during the planning stage. Wtf", "NTA I have begun having the uncomfortable convos with my folks about their money and my future inheritance\u2026 out of necessity but I HATE talking about it.

I personally agree with you that I find it distasteful to talk about inheritance. However, I'd like to give your husband the benefit of the doubt that perhaps these things *are* openly discussed in his family without offense.", "NAH\n\nIt's not your fault that you were raised with decorum, civility and an understanding of conversation in polite society. Equally, it's not his fault he was raised by tacky, classless trash.", "Take this as the red flag it is. \ud83d\udea9Get out of there.", "NAH. It can be annoying but it\u2019s actually best if these things are discussed openly because there will be less fights later.", "NAH it\u2019s cultural", "This is apparently going to be a very unpopular option here but NAH. It\u2019s fine for you to be uncomfortable with it. But as someone who spent many years working in estate law, having conversations like this early before the deaths makes the process later much, much easier. Sure, it\u2019s fine to talk about it with those that will be leaving the assets\u2014but the important conversations are had with those you\u2019ll be sharing them with. There\u2019s a good chance that their willingness to talk about it now will prevent some issues down the road.", "Money is the last taboo, sometimes harder to talk about than sex. And generational wealth transfer is even more taboo, even though it's something a lot of people will be benefiting from in near term future.\n\nEveryone here who points out that an inheritance is conditional is absolutely correct. Stuff happens and a future inheritance is not a guarantee. Looking forward to it is natural, but it's absolutely true that it involves the death of a loved one. \n\nI think Y T A for saying \"never talk about it,\" because you really should plan for future wealth.
