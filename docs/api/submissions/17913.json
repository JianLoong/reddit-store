I mean, I don't really like the word \"normal\" but I would say it is always foolish to spend money that you don't yet have. If word of his big mouth got back to some of these relatives, with the way he is talking so gleefully about the fruits of their demise, they might well rethink his place in the will... but it's just a bit ghoulish beyond that. I may well have some money coming to me some day (not second-house money) and I can't say I've ever thought about or discussed it in that way. That's just me though. I do not think you are out of line for feeling this is inappropriate. If you actually brought the issue to him in the way that you presented it here, then I don't believe you've done anything wrong and if anything, by his reaction it sounds like you may have struck a nerve.\n\nSome people think it's gauche to talk about money in general but that's not the problem here. I agree with you that gleefully and excitedly talking about future purchases to be made as a direct result of the passing of a loved one is disrespectful at best. The main pitfall would be approaching the conversation afterwards indelicately, but it doesn't sound like that was the case.", "NTA, he was being tacky.", "NTA. I think many people would consider it offensive to hear the enthusiasm and excitement with which your husband talks openly about his future inheritance.

And definitely not in the way your husband did it.  I doubt he means any disrespect to his family, but it can come off as if he cares more about the money.\n\nAlso, lots of things can happen between now and the time that your husband's inheritance is paid out to him.  Long-term illness, economic downturns, etc., can all take a toll on savings and investments.  Better not to boast about it now in the event that his family fortunes are reversed in the future.", "NTA \n\nNot only is it tacky for him to talk about inheritance outside of family situations, it's also really presumptuous. \n\nUntil he has the money in hand there is always a chance he won't get anything, and that would have him looking like an even bigger fool in the long run.

Sure, it\u2019s fine to talk about it with those that will be leaving the assets\u2014but the important conversations are had with those you\u2019ll be sharing them with.

We have a cultural taboo against talking about death with our loved ones, and while it's hard, we really need to find ways to do it.\n\nEveryone with children, whether they are rich or poor, young or old, should make a solid and thoughtful plan for both end of life care and what to do with their estate after their death. And absolutely everyone needs to have a healthcare proxy.\n\nAs a nurse, I have taken care of patients at the end of their lives, including young patients who seemed otherwise healthy and had massive strokes. I've seen patients' families do things I know for sure would be against the patients' wishes, but without a healthcare proxy the family makes the decisions. (For example, I've seen the family of a trans patient aggressively misgendering and deadnaming their family member.) Everyone should have a health care proxy form on file with their doctor and hospital system, and everyone needs to talk about what they want with their loved ones. Have the conversation while you're healthy. Don't wait until it's too late.", "NTA\n\nI'm with you, it's incredibly creepy and actually pretty disrespectful to his parents.

This isn't about how much you stand to gain from when you lose your parents as your husband so coldly put it. It's about how it seems like he CAN'T WAIT for them to pass away. It's disturbing and totally not something a normal personal discusses like this. \n\nIt is normal to talk about what will happen to your parents' estate prior to death, but it is in a tying up lose ends kind of mindset to makes the transition easy as possible to to ensure everything is divided the way your parents wished for it to. Your husband is making this seem like an exciting gift he is waiting on. \n\nHonestly, if I got wind of my children talking that way about what would happen to my stuff before I passed away, I'd likely see to it that they got nothing.

I'd say it's cultural differences. My mum just had the absolute worst inheritance battle with her brothers that spanned over 2 years and it completely changed everything.

You know that, right?", "Upvote for Sense and Sensibility ref. \u2764\ufe0f", "Lol good point \ud83d\ude02", "Also, he will be wise if he had 10 times more excitement, but just kept calm externally. \n\nIn AITA language : He will not be AH even if he is 10 times AH but was sush about it", "It's true that neglecting to plan for your death is irresponsible and often causes a world of pain for those left behind. But being excited about what you'll get when someone dies and happily telling family and friends all about it is gross and, yes, tacky. It makes him sound like an immature, greedy child. What a turnoff. Yuck.", "Nah the optics matter.  There's clearly a difference between planning for the worst, and acting giggling and excited about what you're gonna do with the death money.  It screams \"I can't wait.\" \n\nThat's something you can do in private but it looks very very insensitive in public.", "This... my mom regrets that money wasn't discussed in our family which lead to several surprises!!", "This is the take. Have the conversations - with love.", "Yeah when I was a little kid the topic of life insurance came up and I asked my dad what he would get from his life insurance... My kid brain definitely didn't connect the two things.", "I get that, and I am estranged from my mother. She was very abusive. I will inherit a lot and I'm not gleeful over the prospect of her dying. I mentioned to my therapist that I would feel like a hypocrite taking her money upon her death. She then said to me, \"It's a positive thing that one day you will get something good from your mother. Because we all deserve good things from our mothers.\" Especially since good things from my mother, not speaking materially here, were few and far between. And God knows how much I've spent on therapy to deal with the CPTSD, lol.", "But your husband said it made him uncomfortable, OP told him effectively that he didn't appreciate his family - I think that's why this is an ESH.\n\nI talk about my inheritance flippantly too - part of it is because it's how I deal with hard topics and I \\*KNOW\\* I will need to have a level head when they die because no one else in the family will do a god damn thing about settling estate.  If someone told me I didn't appreciate my family because I did that I would tell them to fuck right off with that opinion.", "Money was a huge thing in my family. My grandmother died and left my grandfather 8 figures and not low 8 figures either. When he died, it was all anyone could talk about, such as who was getting what and what was going to be done for whom. It was gross. I dont think OP is the AH, but i do know from an outsider's perspective, my friends told me to shut up a lot (serves me right cause i was screwed out of all of it along with my sister and father), that people dont like hearing about it. I dont think her husband is greedy, but he should definitely temper his expectations and his wife, OP, is helping in an indirect way.", "Yeah, I def have no issue with children inheriting from shitty parents - it\u2019s kinda the least they could do lol - but in the cases I\u2019ve seen, those children are not particularly chuffed, have very mixed/complicated emotions about it and are definitely not all \u201cweee, free money!\u201d.", "That's a good point. I'll agree with your ESH.", "Right.  She's not an asshole for telling him how it looks.  \n\nAlso this is my thing,  HOW you deliver a message matters.  Pulling someone to the side and calmly talking is much different then yelling at someone in public. She pulled him aside, had a civil conversation.  No harm no foul.", "Also sorry you got screwed.", "I mean, that's normal for lions", "\ud83e\udd23", "Didn't know any of that....He hated his father? I thought he blamed himself for his father's death...", "I mean, it\u2019s exaggerated, but the thread assumes that in wanting to be King, he\u2019s looking forward to his inheritance, which assumes his father dying. But I wouldn\u2019t take it too seriously\u2026"]}
