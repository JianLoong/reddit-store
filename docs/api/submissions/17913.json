I mean, I don't really like the word \"normal\" but I would say it is always foolish to spend money that you don't yet have. If word of his big mouth got back to some of these relatives, with the way he is talking so gleefully about the fruits of their demise, they might well rethink his place in the will... but it's just a bit ghoulish beyond that. I may well have some money coming to me some day (not second-house money) and I can't say I've ever thought about or discussed it in that way. That's just me though. I do not think you are out of line for feeling this is inappropriate. If you actually brought the issue to him in the way that you presented it here, then I don't believe you've done anything wrong and if anything, by his reaction it sounds like you may have struck a nerve.\n\nSome people think it's gauche to talk about money in general but that's not the problem here. I agree with you that gleefully and excitedly talking about future purchases to be made as a direct result of the passing of a loved one is disrespectful at best. The main pitfall would be approaching the conversation afterwards indelicately, but it doesn't sound like that was the case.", "NTA, he was being tacky.", "NTA. I think many people would consider it offensive to hear the enthusiasm and excitement with which your husband talks openly about his future inheritance.

And definitely not in the way your husband did it.  I doubt he means any disrespect to his family, but it can come off as if he cares more about the money.\n\nAlso, lots of things can happen between now and the time that your husband's inheritance is paid out to him.  Long-term illness, economic downturns, etc., can all take a toll on savings and investments.  Better not to boast about it now in the event that his family fortunes are reversed in the future.", "NTA \n\nNot only is it tacky for him to talk about inheritance outside of family situations, it's also really presumptuous. \n\nUntil he has the money in hand there is always a chance he won't get anything, and that would have him looking like an even bigger fool in the long run.

Sure, it\u2019s fine to talk about it with those that will be leaving the assets\u2014but the important conversations are had with those you\u2019ll be sharing them with.

This is beyond tacky. He's basically saying, \"Can't wait for the family to die. Life without them will be way better after I get all their stuff.\" It's greedy, and no, normal people don't openly talk about everything they are going to get from someone else's death. Gross.", "I would buy as large a life insurance policy on his life as I could afford.

It\u2019s uncouth.", "NTA talking about inheritance like that really gives the impression of caring more about possessions than actual still living family members. I stand to inherit a nice chunk when my parents pass? Do I plan it out? Nope\u2014 because hoping that day is far, far out in the future\u2014 enough so that\u2019d it\u2019d be silly to even start planning.", "Ok, it seems like I\u2019ve been raised differently.

Be sure to sell them well\u201d.  (Homegirl did non have a single gold tooth in her mouth, she was just a jokester). And she often tell jokingly that I\u2019m the lucky one among my cousins because I\u2019m the only single child, I\u2019m going to be the heiress. \n\nMy parents are the same. They joke about me being able to afford maybe a small car once they are done spending their money.

Grandmother died less than a year after he did. While my friend did not expect to receive anything from the grandmother\u2019s estate her husband\u2019s uncle apparently decided to take this opportunity to screw over her BIL because he was an arrogant ass whom nobody likes. There was a new will signed just 2 days after her husband\u2019s death in the grandmother\u2019s lawyer\u2019s office where all grandchildren received $10K along with their spouses. Her surviving son got X amount and the remainder was donated to charity.

Sure, I am not a world traveler and don't know the ins and outs of all cultures but in my circle we don't talk excitedly about what we will (maybe) get when a loved one dies.  That is because we would rather have the loved one than the money or stuff.  If it were just brought up with you in a private setting sure but happily bragging about it to friends?  Ewwww!  The only person that I have ever heard talk like that is my greedy asshole of an uncle.  Surprise is on him, he won't be getting nearly as much as he thinks he will because of his \"gimme gimme gimme\" attitude.", "It\u2019s not normal to even assume you\u2019ll get an inheritance let alone talk about it publicly.

I still have not been able to spend anything from my inheritance because it's just so sad for me to think about.

NTA", "ESH\n\nHe's an adult and can make his own decisions about how to think and behave, you don't need to police his thoughts or reasoning. It's one thing for it to make you uncomfortable and to ask him not to talk about it around you, but it's a very different thing to tell him that he's not appreciating his family. You're judging and attacking him for having a point of view that you don't understand or agree with when it doesn't really affect you.\n\nHis reaction is AH too, the way he tried to hit back at you as not understanding because you don't stand to inherit anything yourself was rude and uncalled for.", "YTA", "NTA but I assume his parents have a will.

He's just embarrassed that you made him aware that he was embarrassing himself and you.

Don't let the news come from you, that would damage your relationship.\n\nIf nothing bad happens, good for him, but talking about his inheritance might seriously backfire. What is that saying?.......Don't count the chickens before they hatch. That's exactly what he's doing.", "NTA. It\u2019s like he\u2019s excited for people to die. That\u2019s horrible. He also doesn\u2019t know what the wills say. For all he knows that lake house is being left to one person and it\u2019s not him. Do his parents or uncle have long term care insurance? If they end up in a nursing home that money can go fast. Property has to be sold.", "YTA  \nSo was he actually bragging or was he talking excitedly about his future prospects among friends? Why is he not allowed to talk to his sister about their split inheritance? What does he stand to inherit? Millions? Perhaps real estate? Businesses? Is that somehow not exciting?  \n\n\nIt is normal to talk about inheritance in some families. Mine discusses it because we own businesses and we want to keep it in the family. Discussing future plans is normal to make sure you don't blow the money or make poor choices. Realize that the excitement is normal if he stands to inherit a lot.", "NTA. If this is common in your husband's family,  then I'm sorry but you've married into a tacky family.", "NTA, you are totally right and it's gross to be excited about someone dying.", "NTA, why does he assume he will even get anything?  My parents have told my brother and I we will likely get in excess of half a million each but we have no plans for it, for all we know they might spend their final years on a round the world cruise or even bypass us and give everything to an animal sanctuary or their grandkids.  There's a reason for the phrase don't count your chickens before they hatch!", "NTA. As everyone else has already said", "NTA. My husband\u2019s father left us his house.
