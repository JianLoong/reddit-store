In my final year of university. Working a job that paid okay and I managed to afford a cheap!flat with a housemate. I honestly thought life was gonna be great as I had a few months left of my degree and I saw myself being able to eventually going into a better paid job with a better place to live in. Well, my landlord decided to sell and gave us two months notice to leave. I had no hard feelings and I had every confidence I\u2019d find a place but man I got shit luck. Everything was out of my price range and my roommate decided to move back home. It took me almost my whole 2 months notice to find an affordable flat to rent and I basically had to wait 4 months to be able to move in.\n\nI basically was at a loose end and asked my sister if I could stay with her, her husband and their 2 kids as she\u2019s all the family I have just for a few weeks til I figured something out. I was okay with her telling me no, but she basically was so cruel in that she told me I wasn\u2019t her problem, I should have been more prepared and that I better enjoy being homeless as she\u2019s not giving me any handouts. Ngl, her words hurt a lot and she was so bitter that I decided to never ask her for a favour again. I ended up just asking a friend to store my things for me she couch surfing between her and some other friends for the whole 4 months whilst having little to no money to my name as all my money went to the new flat or paying my friends upkeep for having me. (I offered as I felt bad for them having me)\n\nI was in the flat for 3 years until I finally managed to save enough for a little 3-bedroom house for me after working my arse off to get a job relevant to my degree and scrimping.\n\nIm okay now but I\u2019ll never forget how cruel my sister was and how awful being homeless was. I\u2019m 26 now and have gone LC with her. I never really hear from her unless she wants something and she told me that basically her and her family cannot afford their mortgage due to the rates going up. She says they\u2019re going to have to sell the house and find something cheaper and asked if they could stay with me for a while. She said she could pay something and even the kids could share a room and I told her no way in hell. I told her I was sorry for her situation but that she made it clear years ago she wasn\u2019t responsible for me so I\u2019ll extend the same courtesy to her.\n\nShe is saying I\u2019m a heartless AH and ruining her kids lives.\n\nETA: I should add that her kids are my nephews and I barely know them. My sister and I have an okay relationship but it\u2019s clear I\u2019m an after thought to her. When I say she only messages when she wants something, I mean like she\u2019ll send me pictures of the boys then immediately ask for money to get them something. Stuff like that. From what I know the boys are pretty spoiled. They are 8 and 9 and I have literally only been around them a handful of times.\n\nMy sister is 10 years older than me and bailed out on home when she was 17 so I guess I\u2019m like a stranger to her.\n\nThe boys and my BIL are all similar to my sister.

You mentioned that there was a 10 year age difference, and she moved out at 17, and didn\u2019t have much contact after that. It is odd for a 17 year old with a happy family life to move out. And if you were only 7, you probably don\u2019t have many memories of what her life looked like at home. Did she leave because your parents forced her to babysit all of the time and not let her have a life of her own ? Did they treat her like a third parent instead allowing her to be a teenager ? Did she say no because she felt like she already spent 7 years taking care of you because your parents forced her to ? Even if that is the case, you are NTA, you would have been a child and had no idea what was going on, and you should not let her take advantage of you now.

I also bet if you let them come to your house they would try to push you out saying you don\u2019t need that much space as a single person and they could use it because they have kids. I hate narcissist, self entitled people like that! Cut her off!", "NTA. Perfect example of why people should treat people how they want to be treated. Your sister is selfish and doesn\u2019t care about you.", "NTA", "NTA. Next she tells you you\u2019re heartless, just let her know that you learned it from her.", "I could not imagine even *asking* if I didn't have a friendly relationship with you AND turned you down. Absolutely NTA", "Nta, she set the grounds for your relationship all you're doing is respecting it.", "NTA, she reaped what she sowed.", "NTA. She treats you like an ATM.", "NTA - not only do you not owe her a damned thing after the way she turned you out on the street, if you let her establish residence in your house you will never be rid of her.  I guarantee she will use every trick of tenant\u2019s law to sink her claws into your house.  For your own protection, not so much as one night.", "NTA, if family only wants to reach out when they need something they aren\u2019t worth stressing over.", "NTA", "NTA.  You already know a sliver of how cruel and toxic she can be.  Congrats on surviving that last year and then thriving.  Cheers.", "NTA. She reaped what she sowed. Don't feel bad, this is HER fault.", "NTA - and we\u2019ll done! Not only did you manage being homeless but you worked so hard that you are safe and have a home!!!! Honestly that\u2019s amazing! \nAnd I agree with everyone. Tell her your treating her the same way she treated you. While she only had to take you in, just one person that is her sister, you will have to take in 4 people, at-least 3 people you hardly know?!!!! And it\u2019s not your responsibility and tell her she should have been prepared for something like this. \nYou are NOT ruining her kids lives. She and her husband are.\nDon\u2019t let her make you feel bad about yourself or your actions. You had no help from her and were a lot younger. She and her husband are adults with kids. They should have some form of savings at the very least. \n\nAlso they\u2019ll probably overstay until you literally have to kick them out and then they will again say you\u2019re heartless.", "NTA. If she changed to become a better person, it would be different. But she sounds awful.", "NTA.  A kind \u201cno\u201d would have been understandable as we don\u2019t know the situation she was in when she said it.  A cruel \u201cno\u201d is not understandable as it is deliberately hurtful.  Without any back story indicating you had earned such cruelty from her, you\u2019re NTA.", "Hold on, hold on.  If your sister's mortgage is affected by rising rates, that means she has an ARM (adjustable rate mortgage).  If she's 36 now, that means she was just getting old enough to buy a house during the housing market crash of the mid to late aughts when it became abundantly clear that ARMs were risky and problematic.  Was she not paying attention?  Why are people still getting these things?\n\n\n\nAnyway, it's her own fault that she burned the bridge between you and she sounds pretty toxic.  If I were you, I would just go NC.  We did with my BIL and his family and it's honestly been such a relief.\n\n\n\nNTA", "Have you ever thought of changing your number?", "NTA.. karma is hard", ">Given her history, it seems unlikely she would give you any money.\n\nForget money, she's not even going to give OP *respect*. That is not the sort of person you want in your home.", "Yep!  I was thinking that if OP lets the sister and her family move in then they will take over the home.  The BIL and SIL will take control and try to push OP out of their home by making it too much their own and will also want OP for child care all of the time.\n\nThey showed who they are OP.  Perhaps they should heed their own advice and plan better next time.", "ESP when the rates were record low last year", "100% agree with this. So many people forget this little Golden Rule, so why are they so surprised when \u201cWhat goes around comes around\u201d?", "This exactly. Once someone is in your home, even for a few weeks, it's very, very hard to get them out.\n\nThey can claim tenants rights and you're basically screwed and will have to go through a lengthy and expensive legal process to get them out. I speak from experience.", "That also jumped out at me - like wtf?", "There\u2019s also a special satisfaction in knowing that karma is spelled \u201chahahahaha\u201d", "Politics omg \ud83d\ude02", "I re-financed last year and got my lowest interest rate\u2014and lowest monthly payment\u2014yet. It\u2019s less than half of what the rent would be on a house the same size. It can\u2019t be *that* hard to change to a fixed-rate mortgage if one has been making regular payments. \n\nOP\u2019s sister and BIL definitely should have done that.", "They are not your responsibility. \n\nIf you need a reminder of the kind of person your sister is - the kind of person you'd have to share your small space with - remember that she didn't just say \"no.\" She did so *cruelly*. \n\nAnd it doesn't sound like she ever genuinely apologized to you, even now that she wants something from you. Which means she *still* thinks what she did was justifiable and right. \n\nThat's not someone you want in your home. \n\n(Honestly, it might not be someone you want in your life.)", "This seems to be a difficult concept for you, but not wanting a toxic and selfish person in your life (let alone your house) doesn\u2019t have anything inherently to do with some kind of revenge. This isn\u2019t an eye for an eye, it\u2019s just OP sensibly protecting herself.", "No wonder you have belladonna in your username. Because you're toxic.", "mortgages in the UK are only fixed rate for 2-5 years", "Stop telling OP to be a doormat just because it's what you would do."]}
