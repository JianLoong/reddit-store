His cousin (22f) lives in the same city as we do (not our hometown). She lives with her husband and they have a baby (6 months old). We, as well as she, don\u2019t have a lot of friends here, but still rarely see each other. She invites us to her place like 3-4 times a year. We never managed to invite her, because our flat is kinda worse than hers and I don\u2019t want to be embarrassed, I suppose. \n\nI want to believe we are on good terms, but that\u2019s not the case, since she was showing her despise to me when my bf and I were just starting dating. Anyways, I genuinely tried not to involve in conflicts. \n\nThis year, in January, she invited us to her birthday. We had fun, that was cool. \n\nYesterday was my birthday. I posted some pictures as it was a themed party and I thought my costume was great. 10 minutes after I posted it she asks me if it was a party. I replied, that yes, it was my birthday party. She starts asking me why didn\u2019t we invite her and her husband. I said that was a party with my college friends. She sent me a sad emoji. I thought it was over. It wasn\u2019t\u2026\n\nFor the next hour she sends me messages with an interval of 10 minutes: \u201cWe invited you to my birthday\u201d\n\u201cI was really looking forward to it\u201d\n\u201cI even bought you a present\u201d and etc (there\u2019s like 6-7 of them)\n\nWith each new message I started to feel more and more guilty. On one hand, we don\u2019t really text each other often and I don\u2019t see her as my friend at all. On the other\u2026 I feel guilty bc we never invited her to our place and she seems to treat us like the closest ones in the city. And I didn\u2019t reply to her yet. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667597872, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymb89t/aita_for_not_inviting_my_boyfriends_cousin_for_my/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
