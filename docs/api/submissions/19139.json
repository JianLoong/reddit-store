He is only 3 and depending one how many little kids are chowing down on that peanut buttercake could easily mean it's a pretty unsafe environment for him.

I know I'm in the minority but you wouldn't be seeing me or my child for quite some time.", "ESH\n\nYou're not the asshole for getting your daughter the cake she wanted, but you are for how abruptly you handled it. Your sister was probably disappointed that she was getting left out of your daughters party over a cake (I would be too). I also think that there were so many alternative ways you could have approached it that could have allowed your sister and nephew to come while still keeping everyone safe AND giving your daughter the cake she wanted.\n\nBut your sister also should have accepted your decision and not attacked you for your choice to fulfill your daughters birthday request. Your nephew is too young to remember the party and won't understand not being able to go, he'd be totally fine. If she was upset about being left out (which I believe was the real problem), she should have told you about how she was feeling instead of attacking you based off your choices.\n\nEither way I don't actually think you were an \"asshole\" I think you were trying to please your child and went about it in a slightly unnecessarily rude way. I think you could have worked harder to find a compromise. But at the same time you were under no obligation to do so. Your child wanted the cake, you got her the cake, that's perfectly valid.", "YTA. Kids have to learn at some point that they have to make compromises for the sake of others, and this seems like it would have been a good place to start. She could have her special cake another time.

I would explain to my child that we could do a cake with peanut butter for the friend party or privately so we could include our whole family for the family event because 'they all want to be there to celebrate you!' it's an easy thing to teach a kid of be inclusive in these situations.\n\nI have celiac and so does one of my kids and I can bring a gf cupcake to a party if I need to because it's not as severe as peanut allergy - but my family still makes a gf cake for those family events just to be inclusive and considerate. For my daughter's sake I always appreciate it so much and feel so touched that they consider her because she misses out so often. I am unsurprised your sister is hurt that her child missed out on being included.", "YTA\n\nYou could have done a peanut butter cake with her friends, or gotten a small one to have with your household at another time.

You gave her the choice of what cake she wanted and she chose peanut butter and chocolate. Perfectly reasonable.\n\nNephew has an allergy and couldn't go but he's only 3. He won't remember this.

Or perhaps that every event should be accessible to her son? That's some pretty heavy entitlement on her part. Life's not fair, by virtue of his allergy he's going to miss out on some stuff.\n\nINFO: Can I assume that prior to this the families spent a lot of time together? If so, how many other times have you accommodated nephew's peanut allergy so the families could spend time together? \n\nI think you were a little harsh with the \"I said that was fine, because she wasn\u2019t welcome either.\" comment, but just try to do better.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "INFO - do you really not know how to correctly spell \"peanut butter\"?", "NTA - it's your daughter, the entitlement on display expecting your daughter to make her day about the nephew says it all", "NTA it\u2019s your daughters party not your nephews. \n\nPlus she\u2019s turning 7, most 7 year olds I\u2019ve know (and I worked with kids for years) have no or little interest in babies and toddlers if there are anyone their own age or slightly above there. I doubt she\u2019ll miss either nephew, aunt or uncle.\n\nPlus calling a seven year old \u2018selfish\u2019 for wanting their favorite cake more than seeing a toddler family member is just \u2026 I\u2019m trying to find a more diplomatic word for unhinged, but I\u2019m coming up short.", "NTA.

No. \n\nYour sister does have a point that you could have served the penutbutter cake at your daughter\u2019s friend party, but if all previous years she\u2019d had cake with family instead of friends, I kinda get why it might have slipped your mind. \n\nHer request was not unreasonable, but her overblown response makes her an A H.", "YTA, she could have had the peanut butter cake the next day or later that evening", "NTA. It's your daughter's birthday party. Her wishes are more important. Your sister asking her to compromise on her party for someone else is too much. Regardless of age, it shouldn't be asked of anyone to compromise on their wishes  for their birthday party for someone else. Anyone else. \n\nShe made the choice. Good that you support your daughter instead of choosing your nephew over her.", "ESH. Both children need to learn that the world doesn't cater to them. It may be your daughter's favorite cake, but an important family member of hers cannot be near that type of cake. She needs to learn that sometimes you have to compromise. The cousin is very young and not old enough to understand yet, but he will eventually learn that his allergy will exclude him from some other people and events. You should be teaching your daughter compassion and understanding. Of all people, family should be able to compromise and make sacrifices for him. He shouldn't expect it of people, but the people who love him should make those sacrifices.\n\nMy grandma can't have chocolate, for most of my life it's been that way. As a result, my brother and I never had chocolate birthday cakes. We were given the option to choose chocolate, but we never did, because it would mean that grandma would not be able to come to the party. We were taught that people and relationships are more important then objects, even if we really like the object. Chocolate cake was my favorite flavor when I was a small child, but I understood that even though it was my party, my relationship with my grandma was more important.", "NTA.

The responsible thing would be to explain to your daughter that while the peanut butter is her _preference_ it could actually _hurt_ her baby nephew, and this is something she should understand and be aware of as she gets older, if she loves peanut butter so much.\n\nAnd then offer her reasonable alternatives as a compromise. \n\nAlso YTA for thinking that you were going to make it your daughter\u2019s decision, she\u2019s 7, of course she will want what she wants. That\u2019s why parenting is hard sometimes?", "YTA. Massively. First, for how you've acted toward your sister - who, you know, might be struggling with raising a child with such a severe allergy; you might consider making her life easier and not harder.\n\nSecond, for what you're teaching your daughter. Just re-read this sentence you wrote: \"not to expect a seven year old to choose her baby cousin over her favorite cake.\" Let's just agree on this: her cousin is more important than the cake.

It is an absolute miserable age when they have to miss out because they understand what they are missing and don't have the ability to process reasons and move past it. Sister is probably currently dealing with a LOT of her kid's feelings on missing out on stuff. It's not unreasonable to hope a family party might be a safe place to be included. \nOn the other hand, it's not unreasonable to decide not to force a 7 year old to change her desired party for a cousin. There are probably a LOT of gatherings where his allergy will need to be accommodated, so it's fair to let her have what she wants on her birthday. \nHopefully the grownups can work through and learn to navigate this better so the kids don't have a lifetime of resentment against each other.", "The girl is getting two parties!  The point of the family party is for family to be there, so having a peanut butter cake defeats the purpose!", "This is a hard one- since your nephew is SO allergic- you have to really think about it before having the kid around. Can you order some chinese take out or even fried foods? What have you made in the past day that might be still in the air? Do you have peanuts in something?   \n\nHe is also 3 so you can't just have a party outside and be like don't eat that.   \n\nI am saying NTA as you told them ahead of time and let them know you couldn't accommodate and wouldn't force your daughter to accommodate.   \n\nHard part of having strong allergies is you don't get to do everything. It is what it is.  \n\nNOW if this was say a family BBQ or like a fourth of july event or whatever... yeah make space for the nephew homie.   \n\nShoot even a chocolate cake made in a bakery could have some peanut dust on that...   \n\nGood luck.

NTA", "My daughter usually has two parties, one with friends and one with my sister, BIL, nephew, and other relatives who live in our area.", "I told her not to come because of her comments about my daughter, my BIL said no such thing so why wouldn\u2019t he be invited?", "THIS RIGHT HERE ^^^^^^ Everyone who voted YTA needs to read RoundWombats comment", "Fast forward to the next time the kids are alone and the daughter has no idea that her favorite food could actually kill her cousin. smh.", "Read the fourth paragraph. She did talk to her daughter about it and the daughter said no.", "It sounds like that\u2019s exactly what she did and her daughter chose the peanut butter cake over having her cousin come.", "Please, she had two parties. Plenty of opportunity to have her chosen cake wo excluding family from the family party.", "Ngl seeing now that its a whole other party that definitely makes a lot more sense. Op probably wouldn\u2019t even have to buy another cake it\u2019d be easier to make a separate one. However I definitely don\u2019t agree with ops sister calling a literal 7 yr old selfish, might change it to ESH", "She also said they don\u2019t get a cake for that, just pizza, it seems less like a party and more of a hangout. Having to get either two cakes or change an entire cake just for one kid seems a bit odd. But I also understand where ops sister is coming from, it sucks that her child might feel excluded.", "Oh yeah then I\u2019m changing my vote. Thank you.", "She's mastered the art of manipulation at 7.", "It\u2019s not his birthday. Tough luck", "Sometimes having allergies or medical conditions means you miss out, that's just life. It sounds harsh, but you can't expect the whole world to cater to you.", "I'm really not.\n\nIt was a event extended family were attending so excluding two family members from coming and celebrating with you is gross. They could have done a seperate cake for just the immediate family afterwards or the next day or at the friend party. \n\nBeing inclusive and considerate is a great thing to learn to do.", "This person who disagrees doesn't have allergies, but would rather change the kind of cake I have than exclude a loved one.", "She had two different birthday parties on different days. People can have different celebrations on different days all still celebrating their birthday. It's really NOT hard to have one's favorite cake on a different day than the family party, considering she had a friend party on a different day, too.", "She has two birthday parties. Not having a cake that could kill her family member at the one he should have been invited to isn't ruining her birthday.", "Err... Not really sure how this teaches narcissism?", "Idk. Depends on the family, I guess. The nephew is a satellite family member, not like a brother or sister.\n\n On thinking more about this, it seems like this would be an ideal opportunity to teach compassion and empathy. So perhaps I am in the wrong.", ">NOPE! Birthday is not the day for compromise. That is every other day of the year. Her party her birthday her choice. Nephew has allergies sorry can't come to this one. How fucking entitled can one be to expect a child to accommodate her cousin on HER BIRTHDAY.", "NOPE! Birthday is not the day for compromise. That is every other day of the year. Her party her birthday her choice. Nephew has allergies sorry can't come to this one. How fucking entitled can one be to expect a child to accommodate her cousin on HER BIRTHDAY.", "For this alone YTA. You know she will have two parties and you know your nephews allergies. The polite thing to do is have the allergy cake at the party your nephew won\u2019t be attending.", "Because obviously they're a family unit and they have to deal with daily challenges of a child with a serious medical condition. \nYou excluded his wife (your sister) and kid from a family party, and you really think he's going to show up and celebrate with you?\nFrom an objective perspective it looks like you're playing divide and conquer. \nYou started by calling your sister to tell her not to bring her son. \nI get that she said mean things, but she was probably hurt at the thought of her own family dismissing her child's lifelong condition. \nAnd then you try to invite her husband without her...", "Who tf wants to attend a family birthday for a small child when they aren't even allowed to bring their own small child? Like, seriously? If you were dead set on this peanut butter cake specifically at the extended family party, you never even should've invited this part of the extended family to begin with. \"Come to the birthday party for my kid, but leave your kid at home.\" No one is gonna do that.", "Because he's not leaving his excluded child at home?!?", "It\u2019s still not his birthday. She can have any damn cake she wants.", "As someone with allergies who has kids with allergies I'm well aware. But man it's amazing when family and friends put in that bit of effort to be inclusive. It would have been an easy change to make and the kid had two parties anyways.", "Teach them to be inclusive the other 364 days a year, it\u2019s her birthday let her have the cake she wants. The 3 year old doesn\u2019t even know they\u2019re being excluded.\n\nIt\u2019s. Her. BIRTHDAY", "Category three! Lol thank you for being decent and considerate", "She has two birthday parties, only one of them has cake. Bffr the three year old won\u2019t give a shit anyway.", "We did this growing up, having a dinner with the extended family (cousins,uncle/aunt, grandparents) to celebrate birthdays. If possible, we'd often group birthdays too (e.g. we had three birthdays that fell within a month of each other, so those got done as one event)", "If it's a party where other extended family members are invited - which I'm assuming it is, I just think it's awful. Because grandparents and any nieces or nephews without allergies would be included and this one kid has to miss out.\n\nI dunno. I have allergies, my kid has allergies and we have a lot of friends who have different allergies and dietary requirements and to me it's the most straightforward issue in the world. My kid without allergies has definitely learnt so many valuable lessons about being inclusive and considerate too. I just think it's such an easy thing to just make a peanut butter cake for the family to enjoy when the extended family is gone. You could get all excited about it and talk to your kid about how cool it would be to have *two* cakes and how nice it will be if her Aunty and cousin can come etc.", "I might say yes, if that was the only party she was having however, there seems to be multiple parts to her birthday so the peanut butter cake could have easily been fit in elsewhere while still ensuring the family party remained an actual family party.", "POLITE  is not even considered in the responses that say ENTITLEMENT matters.", "And grow up to be heartless just like her parent.", "Excellent points made. I can see your side as well. I didn't make the assumption that other extended family members were invited. \n\nDon't know if OP is actually reading this or not, but you missed a golden opportunity for a positive life lesson for your daughter here. Empathy and compassion are valuable life skills that need to be taught and instilled in today's children. So for that I am changing my opinion to YTA.", "It would be weird if it was just immediate family and there would have been no reason to inform extended family about the cake if not - that's why I've assumed!\n\nI fully agree that empathy and compassion are so valuable. And it honestly feels really nice to see my friends kids with different allergies who are usually excluded be able to enjoy parties. My kids are always really proud and excited and help make the cake and excitedly will tell their allergy friends the ingredients. It gives them joy to include others and I think it's the best."]}
