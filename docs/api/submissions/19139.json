He is only 3 and depending one how many little kids are chowing down on that peanut buttercake could easily mean it's a pretty unsafe environment for him.

I know I'm in the minority but you wouldn't be seeing me or my child for quite some time.", "ESH\n\nYou're not the asshole for getting your daughter the cake she wanted, but you are for how abruptly you handled it. Your sister was probably disappointed that she was getting left out of your daughters party over a cake (I would be too). I also think that there were so many alternative ways you could have approached it that could have allowed your sister and nephew to come while still keeping everyone safe AND giving your daughter the cake she wanted.\n\nBut your sister also should have accepted your decision and not attacked you for your choice to fulfill your daughters birthday request. Your nephew is too young to remember the party and won't understand not being able to go, he'd be totally fine. If she was upset about being left out (which I believe was the real problem), she should have told you about how she was feeling instead of attacking you based off your choices.\n\nEither way I don't actually think you were an \"asshole\" I think you were trying to please your child and went about it in a slightly unnecessarily rude way. I think you could have worked harder to find a compromise. But at the same time you were under no obligation to do so. Your child wanted the cake, you got her the cake, that's perfectly valid.", "YTA. Kids have to learn at some point that they have to make compromises for the sake of others, and this seems like it would have been a good place to start. She could have her special cake another time.

I would explain to my child that we could do a cake with peanut butter for the friend party or privately so we could include our whole family for the family event because 'they all want to be there to celebrate you!' it's an easy thing to teach a kid of be inclusive in these situations.\n\nI have celiac and so does one of my kids and I can bring a gf cupcake to a party if I need to because it's not as severe as peanut allergy - but my family still makes a gf cake for those family events just to be inclusive and considerate. For my daughter's sake I always appreciate it so much and feel so touched that they consider her because she misses out so often. I am unsurprised your sister is hurt that her child missed out on being included.", "YTA\n\nYou could have done a peanut butter cake with her friends, or gotten a small one to have with your household at another time.

You gave her the choice of what cake she wanted and she chose peanut butter and chocolate. Perfectly reasonable.\n\nNephew has an allergy and couldn't go but he's only 3. He won't remember this.

Or perhaps that every event should be accessible to her son? That's some pretty heavy entitlement on her part. Life's not fair, by virtue of his allergy he's going to miss out on some stuff.\n\nINFO: Can I assume that prior to this the families spent a lot of time together? If so, how many other times have you accommodated nephew's peanut allergy so the families could spend time together? \n\nI think you were a little harsh with the \"I said that was fine, because she wasn\u2019t welcome either.\" comment, but just try to do better.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "INFO - do you really not know how to correctly spell \"peanut butter\"?", "NTA - it's your daughter, the entitlement on display expecting your daughter to make her day about the nephew says it all", "NTA it\u2019s your daughters party not your nephews. \n\nPlus she\u2019s turning 7, most 7 year olds I\u2019ve know (and I worked with kids for years) have no or little interest in babies and toddlers if there are anyone their own age or slightly above there. I doubt she\u2019ll miss either nephew, aunt or uncle.\n\nPlus calling a seven year old \u2018selfish\u2019 for wanting their favorite cake more than seeing a toddler family member is just \u2026 I\u2019m trying to find a more diplomatic word for unhinged, but I\u2019m coming up short.", "NTA.

No. \n\nYour sister does have a point that you could have served the peanutbutter cake at your daughter\u2019s friend party, but if all previous years she\u2019d had cake with family instead of friends, I kinda get why it might have slipped your mind. \n\nHer request was not unreasonable, but her overblown response makes her an A H.", "YTA, she could have had the peanut butter cake the next day or later that evening", "NTA. It's your daughter's birthday party. Her wishes are more important. Your sister asking her to compromise on her party for someone else is too much. Regardless of age, it shouldn't be asked of anyone to compromise on their wishes  for their birthday party for someone else. Anyone else. \n\nShe made the choice. Good that you support your daughter instead of choosing your nephew over her.", "ESH. Both children need to learn that the world doesn't cater to them. It may be your daughter's favorite cake, but an important family member of hers cannot be near that type of cake. She needs to learn that sometimes you have to compromise. The cousin is very young and not old enough to understand yet, but he will eventually learn that his allergy will exclude him from some other people and events. You should be teaching your daughter compassion and understanding. Of all people, family should be able to compromise and make sacrifices for him. He shouldn't expect it of people, but the people who love him should make those sacrifices.\n\nMy grandma can't have chocolate, for most of my life it's been that way. As a result, my brother and I never had chocolate birthday cakes. We were given the option to choose chocolate, but we never did, because it would mean that grandma would not be able to come to the party. We were taught that people and relationships are more important then objects, even if we really like the object. Chocolate cake was my favorite flavor when I was a small child, but I understood that even though it was my party, my relationship with my grandma was more important.", "NTA.

The responsible thing would be to explain to your daughter that while the peanut butter is her _preference_ it could actually _hurt_ her baby nephew, and this is something she should understand and be aware of as she gets older, if she loves peanut butter so much.\n\nAnd then offer her reasonable alternatives as a compromise. \n\nAlso YTA for thinking that you were going to make it your daughter\u2019s decision, she\u2019s 7, of course she will want what she wants. That\u2019s why parenting is hard sometimes?", "YTA. Massively. First, for how you've acted toward your sister - who, you know, might be struggling with raising a child with such a severe allergy; you might consider making her life easier and not harder.\n\nSecond, for what you're teaching your daughter. Just re-read this sentence you wrote: \"not to expect a seven year old to choose her baby cousin over her favorite cake.\" Let's just agree on this: her cousin is more important than the cake.

It is an absolute miserable age when they have to miss out because they understand what they are missing and don't have the ability to process reasons and move past it. Sister is probably currently dealing with a LOT of her kid's feelings on missing out on stuff. It's not unreasonable to hope a family party might be a safe place to be included. \nOn the other hand, it's not unreasonable to decide not to force a 7 year old to change her desired party for a cousin. There are probably a LOT of gatherings where his allergy will need to be accommodated, so it's fair to let her have what she wants on her birthday. \nHopefully the grownups can work through and learn to navigate this better so the kids don't have a lifetime of resentment against each other.", "The girl is getting two parties!  The point of the family party is for family to be there, so having a peanut butter cake defeats the purpose!", "This is a hard one- since your nephew is SO allergic- you have to really think about it before having the kid around. Can you order some chinese take out or even fried foods? What have you made in the past day that might be still in the air?

It is what it is.  \n\nNOW if this was say a family BBQ or like a fourth of july event or whatever... yeah make space for the nephew homie.   \n\nShoot even a chocolate cake made in a bakery could have some peanut dust on that...   \n\nGood luck.

I understand she doesn\u2019t want her son to be left out of family events, but this is your kid\u2019s birthday party and it\u2019s her right to accommodate her party to her liking. Great job on not going along with your sister\u2019s demands. This would\u2019ve taught your daughter to be a doormat for her aunt and her family in the near future.\n\nAlso, did she forget about the future birthday parties? From the sound of if, your daughter gets a wide range of choices as the main course for her birthday parties. This might just be the only (or one of the few) birthday parties her son is unable to attend.", "NTA. She asked if you could change it you said you would ask your daughter and the daughter said no and that really should have been the end of it. The cousin is three he doesn't really have a concept of birthdays and what's going on unless like the parents are acting a fool that day and then he might notice something is up. \nIf he was older the answer might be different but also if he was older then your daughter might have changed her mind because he would probably be more fun to be around. \n\nLike yes she could have had the cake at a separate party or another day or whatever and I know people say that this would have been a great opportunity to teach her how to be generous and kind even when it's all about her. But why does a birthday have to be a lesson? Why does she have to be the one to learn all these lessons on her day. What is so wrong about a kid wanting their birthday cake at their birthday party when they want it?? Too often too many people especially girls/women are told that they need to make concessions for others at events that are meant for them. And I say no more of that.", "NTA. Her cousin doesn\u2019t need to be there for her birthday. He is going to have a hard way to go because of his allergies and asking your daughter to sacrifice is not the way to fix it. Your sister needs to get comfortable with this as her reality.", "YTA. you could have easily had the cake at the pizza party, and reaching out to your sister\u2019s man behind her back was a street gutter move. Like, what did you think was gonna happen? You thought this man would be enticed to come celebrate your child when his was excluded, all to support you, a person who said his wife was unwelcome? If your logic here is that this uncle should be fine with discomfort in his home life because he loves his niece than you may want to re-examine why you don\u2019t hold the same standards for yourself in your dealings with your nephew.

How did you see that even playing out?\n\nI agree it's your daughter's bday so she can choose the cake, but you could have also made a special one for just you guys so all the family could attend the party safely. Unfortunately, showing lack of concern for a deadly allergy in a close family member might be a wedge you can't fix.", "YTA.

Birthdays might be one of the opportunities to celebrate with friends and families, I'm unsure how old the nephew is but he might feel excluded, which is exactly what your sister had in her POV.

Why? Because you\u2019ve basically excluded your nephew from a family gathering.\n\nI understand that this is the flavor of cake that your daughter wanted but teaching her to compromise isn\u2019t so hard. For example, why couldn\u2019t she have had cake AND pizza at her friend party? Or why not buy a peanut butter cake for only your immediate, nuclear family?\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to be a kid with severe allergies, many allergy kids have to be excluded from all types of birthday parties and celebrations. He should honestly at least be able to attend events put on by close family members.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t agree with the sister calling your child selfish.

You do not deserve any kind of award for good parenting and your coldness and lack of empathy or compassion for your nephew or the difficulties your sister must go through to keep him safe come through every word in your post.  I feel badly for a little kid who will naturally find himself on the outside in many social situations due to a life-threatening allergy, and then had his aunt and cousin stick a knife in his heart.

You could have easily served a different cake at the party, but had the cake your daughter wanted that evening or at a different time of day.

I emailed my cousin's wife to get a safe recipe for her son and ALL the cookies I made for the kids were safe, just to avoid any sort of risk and have him be included. Sure, you don't *have* to accommodate an allergy, but it's the kind thing to do and you missed the boat on teaching your daughter some empathy.", "ESH (Except the two kids)\n\nThere are a million compromises that could have been made here.  Plus, this is the SECOND birthday celebration.  I'm not saying there's something wrong with that, but OP should be teaching her daughter that excluding one person for something that is entirely out of their control is not showing kindness.  They could get her a pb cake any other time and celebrate with just immediate family (parents/sibs) instead of having it at the extended family party, or just a pb cupcake for breakfast one day or something.  \n\nI cannot imagine throwing a family party and telling my 3 year old nibling that they weren't allowed to come bc we couldn't stay away from pb for the gathering.  \n\nSister sucks, too, but to a lesser extent.  She is likely already seeing her kid excluded from so much and to hear her own sibling purposefully excluding him from the party entirely is hurtful.

What did you think was going to happen? NAH. Everyone is behaving reasonably - you get what you want, but it is not reasonable for you to expect the excluded family to be happy about it. \n\nI have a special needs child. My sister taught her kids to stop and figure out how to include him in whatever they're doing. My husband's family behaved like you. Guess who is in our life, and who isn't? \n\nThere may come a day when your daughter wishes her aunt and her cousin were in her life. Are you going to feel comfortable telling her that you traded them for a peanutbutter cake when she was 7? Seems like a terrible idea to me, but maybe peanut butter is just that important.", "Yes, YTA. This was an opportunity to teach your daughter compassion, empathy, and cooperation.  With friends, or immediate family, she could have had the PB cake, and chose differently for the extended family party.

What do you want to do?\" Or did you say \"you don't want to skip peanut butter cake because your cousin wants something else?\"\n\nIn my experience, kids actually have some compassion and want to be inclusive, if they understand the choice. I'm curious how you presented this to her, and whether she actually understood the scope of the question.", "ESH.  \n\nIf it's a family party, choose a menu that isn't going to necessarily exclude one person.

I\u2019m always so grateful for that rare person who asks what my child can have and how to keep him safe. And if I invited another child into my home who was allergic to a food, I would not ask my seven year old to decide what to eat- I\u2019d list a few safe options and ask her to choose from those. My seven year old would also already know about her cousin\u2019s allergies, and why we don\u2019t invite people to our home and make it unsafe for guests, even on a birthday. \n\nMy daughter is four and she already asks whether food is safe for her brother. You can raise your kids to be kind or you can raise them to think about themselves first. You can raise them to be considerate of others\u2019 disabilities or you can raise them to exclude people. Honestly it\u2019s the saddest thing when people in your own family don\u2019t care enough to be accommodating. \n\nYTA for your attitude and for going behind your sister\u2019s back to contact your BIL.

I don\u2019t mess with this, dad doesn\u2019t usually roll that way, but mom has a soft spot and if her mood isn\u2019t great she\u2019s 100% letting sister\u2019s tears dictate life. Again, usually was kinda crappy but whatever but today? Today was *MY* birthday! Wtf! \n\nSo I started crying and was upset. I said it was unfair that she always picked the restaurant not only on her birthday but every time we went out we went there. I am not a big fan of said restaurant compared to others but said whatever on other nights. But *my birthday*? My *13th* birthday? So I got hit with the \u201clife isn\u2019t fair, look at what she has to deal with and tell us about fair!\u201d crap, grounded, and they went out to eat on *my* birthday to *her* favorite restaurant *without me*. \n\nI hated her for months after that. Looking back I realize it was more my parents\u2026 she was just doing what she\u2019d learned she could to get what she wanted and at that point probably didn\u2019t really understand why it was mean to do to me. But my parents knew. And to this day I remember the seething hatred over it. And there were definitely other times over the years but this was one of the worst for sure.
