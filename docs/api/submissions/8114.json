So I casually drove by and he and a couple of kids were talking and laughing. I pulled over and said hi. He asked if I was picking him up because it wasn't 4. I said no, I just drove by and wanted to say hi. He asked me if I could leave because I was embarrassing him. I laughed and said there is nothing wrong with a dad saying hi.\n\nThen I saw my 12yo running without a shirt with his middle school track team. I pulled over and told him to put on a shirt.

I was actually going to see if he needed a towel or a Gatorade.\n\nNow both boys are giving me the silent treatment and told them to leave them alone at school.

Your kids both made it clear you were embarrassing them in front of their friends/teammates/coaches and you kept pushing instead of saying ok, sorry, have a good time and backing off. Pre-teen and teenagers are feeling their way around friendships and relationships, and parents butting in when the kids are not doing anything wrong is unnecessary and going to sour those budding relationships, as well as mess with the kids' self-esteem. There's a reason you aren't getting much information from them about their friendships--because they don't want you involved. And if they're not doing anything to hurt themselves or others, you should NOT be involved beyond offering snacks when they are at your house or making sure people have rides. The best thing you can do to facilitate their friendships is stay out of them unless either someone's going to get injured or doing something seriously wrong, or your kid asks for advice/help. They need space to learn social interactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with a 12 year old boy running track without a shirt.

Overbearing parents to these teens are not cool. I know you mean well by your actions, but you can still be supportive of them while giving them some space.

Thinking of only younger naked bodies as sexualized with that going away with age is not necessarily the healthiest world view.

It seems like your intentions are good but your execution is wildly off base.
