When he came back, he pitched a fit about wanting to keep her an extra week not because he wanted to spend the time with her, but because the way the current schedule was laid out he couldn't go to a music festival to see his favourite band.

She went to her dad's on Sunday and he ended up calling me on Tuesday asking me to keep her this week because he's really I'll (even though the doctor said it's the cold) and basically can't keep her. I agreed and am keeping her this week handling her pick ups and drop offs at daycare and taking her to her activities. No big deal. The problem comes in where he's asked if I would be willing to let him keep her next week since he is missing this week. I told him absolutely not because her schedule has already been swapped once it wouldn't be fair to her to swap it again. He called me vindictive and said that I'm trying to keep her away from him because will basically be with me for a whole month because of this. I reminded him that he made the choice to send her to me because of a cold. \n\nThe only reason why I'm sticking to my guns here is because when I've asked him to give me mild concessions such as this and they were only begrudgingly accepted while also small rants of \"his schedule being disrupted\" gets tossed at me passive aggressively.

But sometimes you\u2019re got to play the long game with men like that", "As I mentioned in a prior post, my child's schedule has been changed twice now. Every time it got changed, she would go through a period of tantrums, emotional deregulation, and just general discontent.

You\u2019re absolutely doing the right thing by providing stability. My kids lashed out when the schedule altered. I stayed steady. They appreciate it.

Three years old is a very delicate age. Structure is very important for a three year old, especially after so much disruption. \n\nI don't want to go so far as to say that your ex husband is the asshole, but it might be a good idea to remind him of this as well. Explain to him and reassure him that it isn't between you and him, rather your daughter is experiencing negative reactions to the changing schedule and it is important that you both find a schedule that works for everyone and stick to it. Emphasize that the important factor is consistency and then be a little malleable about what works for both of you. \n\nIf it really is that important that he gets her that particular week, maybe concede on the condition that you guys immediately get back on a strict schedule. This will show that your main priority is your child and that you are willing to compromise in order to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. \n\nI know that 11 months isn't that long and im sure that there is still a lot of emotions between you two, as is completely normal.

One individual had just lost their leg to some disaster and the other person had just hit this windfall of cash.

Ofcourse, isolated events disrupt that dial and send it one way or another, but over time, regardless of the disruption, that dial always finds its way back to that equilibrium. Even things as traumatic as losing a limb, or even divorce can't change that equilibrium. No amount of good fortune can either.\n\n Time will always correct it. \n\nI tell you this because when I say that things will get better, they will. It is scientifically proven. Your dial is disrupted at the moment. But be diligent and one day you will be able to look back and reflect on the hardships that you have overcome.
