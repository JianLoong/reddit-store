You are totally right for standing up for yourself, but problem isn\u2019t too many sisters, it\u2019s their ultimatums as a group where real problem arises. I\u2019d be pretty pissed in your shoes as well, so no judgement here, cause you\u2019re dealing with some on going shit here. Also, if I were you, I\u2019d explain what you meant, meaning advice is okay, making decisions for you is not, and being the youngest in your family is tough to deal with. I should add that when my older sibling made a call like your sister did here, was cause of mistakes they made, and instead of sharing their experience, they just said you should have/do  (in this case your BF)", "NTA --- Sounds like your sisters are the ones you should be confronting about this and telling them to keep their noses out of your business.", "NTA I don't agree with the way you spoke to him but considering he kicked you out for the night for it, I'm going to guess disagreements aren't handled rationally in your household by anyone & you're only behaving how you've been taught.\n\nRanting and screaming aren't going to convince anyone you're mature enough to make your own decisions though", "NTA.

Your sister's need to understand that they are not a replacement for your mother and you're now an adult and they need to respect your boundaries.", "NTA.

But at this point you are probably too selfish to see. \n\nApologize to your father otherwise you'll soon be out of your family.\n\nYTA", "OP, I feel for you. I really do. I'm from a large family myself, although I'm not the youngest.\n\nIt's difficult when you feel everyone else in your family gets more attention, more praise, more freedom...\n\nYou are not TA for expressing how frustrating it is that they treat you like a baby. I'm glad you've moved out for college, and that you're starting to stand up for yourself. Those are good things.\n\nBut you kind of buried the lede with this post. If we were to go by the subject line alone, all you did was say you hate being the youngest. Which wouldn't make you TA at all. It's OK to feel that way.\n\nWhat you actually said was I *hate having so many sisters, and he should have wrapped his stupid dick.* You went too far with that remark, and I think you know it. That was gratuitously hurtful.\n\nSo, *very* reluctantly, I'm going with ESH: your father and sisters for how they're treating you, and you for that last remark.\n\nI think you can apologize without losing face here. Apologize to him for that one remark. *Just* that remark, not for all the rest. Acknowledge that you said it to hurt him, and you regret it. But you can also tell him it arose from frustration that you're still being treated like a child rather than an adult.\n\n(Your sisters' suggestion that you should buy him a gift seems over the top, in my opinion. You don't *buy* your way back into someone's good books. You make amends for the specific wrong you've done - in this case, by apologizing sincerely.)\n\nOne more suggestion: to get what you want, you need to play the long game. You're frustrated that your sisters and your father never treat you like an adult? Then you need to *behave* like an adult, always. And that means when they say and do things to upset you, don't scream, don't retaliate by saying nasty things, don't throw a tantrum. State your position calmly and with dignity, then walk away if the atmosphere is getting too heated and you're worried you'll lose your cool.\n\nActually *behaving* like an adult will gain you much more freedom in the long run than any amount of *telling* them you're an adult.", "YTA for one reason.... telling him he should have \"wrapped his stupid dick.\"  I was on your side until that comment.  Yes, you have a right to hate being the 5th of all girls and being the \"baby\" of the family... but you shouldn't have attacked your father for having 5 kids.  Also, the guy had to raise 5 children as a single parent.  I'm sorry that you were mistreated by your family for being the youngest.... but telling him he should have wrapped his dick... that's a hurtful comment that will stick with him for years.
