My mom died when I was 4 and my dad (49M) has raised us alone ever since. \n\nI don't really have an issue with my dad's parenting. It's mostly with how my sisters treat me. I'm the \"baby\". I'm always treated like an infant who can't do things. They're fiercely overprotective to the point where I can't do anything normal teenagers do.  \n\nFor example: one time, I wasn't even allowed to go to a birthday party when I was 15 because boys would be there, and it was my sisters who decided that. I've always had to share my things and even now I'm so bad at standing up for myself. I was always compared to my \"perfect\" sisters and even now my family still tells me about what they were doing at my age that was so amazing. It really annoys me the older I get. I can't be my own person.\n\nI love them, but our relationships have been rocky since I moved out for college. I'm on my own for the first time and loving it. I got a boyfriend who I adore and I'm really finding myself.\n\nI'm home for summer now, and a couple days ago I got into a big fight with my dad. He found out about my boyfriend and told me I needed to break up with him. He's never even met the guy!! He told me I'm too young to date and compared me to my sisters who I know damn well hooked up with a ton of boys in college. \n\nI'm not a person who usually gets angry. I was raised to always respect my elders and it's a massive sin in my culture to talk back. But I was mad. \n\nI said that I'm an adult now and can make my own choices, good or bad. He admitted that it was my oldest sister who \"brought this to his attention\" and that made me even madder. \n\nI screamed a little bit at him, to get my point across. I told him that I hate being the youngest, and I hate having so many sisters, and he should have wrapped his stupid dick. He was incredibly upset with me and kicked me out for the night. \n\nI ranted to my boyfriend about all this and he told me my dad was being ridiculous, but I can't help but feel like maybe I should have kept my mouth shut. Two of my sisters reached out and told me I need to apologize -and even bring a gift. I'm just so fucking sick of being the youngest daughter.

I\u2019d sit down and communicate that while you want to apologise for your poor choice of words, his constant comparisons to your sisters and their behaviour towards you is unacceptable and needs to stop. \n\nTake some time to really flesh out how you\u2019re feeling, what the triggers are that infuriate you, approach the discussion constructively, and hopefully some change will be forthcoming.", "NTA\n\nyour sisters and your father was raising you in such an unreasonable and unfair way, plus I feel like it was a bit extreme to KICK YOU OUT for a night for expressing your frustrations with it!", "Don\u2019t blame you a bit for being upset, but you gotta say what real problem is (that you\u2019re not being trusted to make your own life decisions), and not superimpose past crap on present crap. You are totally right for standing up for yourself, but problem isn\u2019t too many sisters, it\u2019s their ultimatums as a group where real problem arises. I\u2019d be pretty pissed in your shoes as well, so no judgement here, cause you\u2019re dealing with some on going shit here. Also, if I were you, I\u2019d explain what you meant, meaning advice is okay, making decisions for you is not, and being the youngest in your family is tough to deal with. I should add that when my older sibling made a call like your sister did here, was cause of mistakes they made, and instead of sharing their experience, they just said you should do/have (in this case your BF)", "NTA --- Sounds like your sisters are the ones you should be confronting about this and telling them to keep their noses out of your business.", "NTA I don't agree with the way you spoke to him but considering he kicked you out for the night for it, I'm going to guess disagreements aren't handled rationally in your household by anyone & you're only behaving how you've been taught.\n\nRanting and screaming aren't going to convince anyone you're mature enough to make your own decisions though", "NTA.  I'm so sorry you didn't have a mom in your life.  Sounds like your sisters tried to be \"mom\" way too early in their lives.  I would have definitely blown a gasket if I found out my sister was informing on me.  I do think you should talk about all these feelings to a friend or counselor.  Bottled up feelings are what causes big blow-ups.  There are probably a lot of experiences you feel left out of.", "NTA but I don't think this is about the amount of siblings you have - more that you just have not the greatest family dynamic. Sounds like your Dad is out of his depth and your older siblings have been trying to take on the role of your mother. But they're not your Mum.\n\nThis is a pretty abnormal dynamic and I would say it's much more to do with the death of a parent shifting the dynamic than the amount of siblings you have.\n\nYou should probably apologise for the condom comment but I would be having a serious talk about family dynamics - possibly with the whole family present. Your sister's need to understand that they are not a replacement for your mother and you're now an adult and they need to respect your boundaries.", "NTA. I have no doubt your sisters gave up a lot to fulfil a Motherly role but these expectations are unfair. And even though what you said to your Dad was shitty the fact that he threw you out for the night was a gross and frankly negligent overcorrection. Might be worth trying to find somewhere else to stay.", "Dude. Find one of those \u201cask mom\u201d Reddit subs.", "NTA definitely poorly worded and should've been talked about sooner.

I feel for you, OP. I'm 30 now, married with a dog, and make the most out of all my siblings, and my oldest brother still can't see me as anything but that little kid that followed him everywhere. \n\nMaybe you coukd have phrased it better, but your dad could have appeoached the conversation a whole lot better. NTA all the same, and I find it incredibly concerning that your dad kicked you out over it.\n\nHope you're safe, and good for you for finally standing up for yourself.", "\u201cDad, I\u2019m sorry for shouting and the way I phrased why I said.

I know what you are talking about since I am the youngest for 4 with massive age gaps. But did you ever think aside from yourself. If you look around you'll probably find how how much your caretakers must have to give up for you. Especially dad with 5 children and the eldest sister. But at this point you are probably too selfish to see. \n\nApologize to your father otherwise you'll soon be out of your family.\n\nYTA", "OP, I feel for you. I really do. I'm from a large family myself, although I'm not the youngest.\n\nIt's difficult when you feel everyone else in your family gets more attention, more praise, more freedom...\n\nYou are not TA for expressing how frustrating it is that they treat you like a baby. I'm glad you've moved out for college, and that you're starting to stand up for yourself. Those are good things.\n\nBut you kind of buried the lede with this post. If we were to go by the subject line alone, all you did was say you hate being the youngest. Which wouldn't make you TA at all. It's OK to feel that way.\n\nWhat you actually said was I *hate having so many sisters, and he should have wrapped his stupid dick.* You went too far with that remark, and I think you know it. That was gratuitously hurtful.\n\nSo, *very* reluctantly, I'm going with ESH: your father and sisters for how they're treating you, and you for that last remark.\n\nI think you can apologize without losing face here. Apologize to him for that one remark. *Just* that remark, not for all the rest. Acknowledge that you said it to hurt him, and you regret it. But you can also tell him it arose from frustration that you're still being treated like a child rather than an adult.\n\n(Your sisters' suggestion that you should buy him a gift seems over the top, in my opinion. You don't *buy* your way back into someone's good books. You make amends for the specific wrong you've done - in this case, by apologizing sincerely.)\n\nOne more suggestion: to get what you want, you need to play the long game. You're frustrated that your sisters and your father never treat you like an adult? Then you need to *behave* like an adult, always. And that means when they say and do things to upset you, don't scream, don't retaliate by saying nasty things, don't throw a tantrum. State your position calmly and with dignity, then walk away if the atmosphere is getting too heated and you're worried you'll lose your cool.\n\nActually *behaving* like an adult will gain you much more freedom in the long run than any amount of *telling* them you're an adult.", "YTA for one reason.... telling him he should have \"wrapped his stupid dick.\"  I was on your side until that comment.  Yes, you have a right to hate being the 5th of all girls and being the \"baby\" of the family... but you shouldn't have attacked your father for having 5 kids.  Also, the guy had to raise 5 children as a single parent.  I'm sorry that you were mistreated by your family for being the youngest.... but telling him he should have wrapped his dick... that's a hurtful comment that will stick with him for years.
