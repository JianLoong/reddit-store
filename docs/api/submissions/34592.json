He\u2019s the one making the noise so he should do something about mitigating it.", "NTA\n\npresuming you still love the idiot and want to hang around even after this show of how he thinks of you - perhaps noise cancelling headphones?  just make sure they cancel voices out as well though or his tv is going to come straight through.\n\nyou also have the option of going to another room - perhaps he will eventually notice that you arent hanging around as much and it might sink in a bit.", "NTA. You're being reasonable.", "NTA. Your partner should have awareness and put on headphones.", "You\u2019ve made the considerate step of wearing earplugs when you can so you can continue to be around your partner while also solving the issue of the background noise. Your partner can also be considerate and use earphones/headphones so you don\u2019t have to be the one to use ear plugs all the damn time or they can watch TV and TikTok on their own. You are NTA here", "Absolutely NTA. Everyone who scrolls tiktok on speaker around other people are assholes, especially if there\u2019s already another media being played.", "NTA.  TikTok\u2019s AND the TV in the background!?  No, he needs to wear earphones.  I can\u2019t believe he isn\u2019t, that is so inconsiderate.", "NTA. It\u2019s your home too, you both deserve to be comfortable there", "NTA, but you might want to try over the ear noise cancelling headphones as well", "NAH but sounds like the relationship isn\u2019t working. Find someone more compatible.", "NTA. He has no respect for you", "ESH. I don\u2019t think is responsible to ask someone to do something you\u2019re not willing to do because of something that only bothers you. It\u2019s also inconsiderate to play both a tv and a phone at the same time in a communal place.\n\nI would say he is slightly more in the right, you can go somewhere else or wear headphones or earbuds if it\u2019s something that bothers you. I wear headphones with classical music when my wife is watching her tv. I have ADHD and it helps me drown out the tv. It\u2019s not as comfortable as just not having the tv on but it\u2019s a good compromise.", "ESH\n\nAs a couple, it's about give and take and you'll need to come up with a compromise that appeases you both.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Could also be handy for blocking out other noises like dishwashers and the neighbours.", "NTA. My son has ADHD. He likes gaming and normally wears headphones so he doesn't disturb me, but they bother him after a while.  He will ask if I mind before he puts his multiplayer games on speaker, and I'll switch to noise cancelling headphones if I am listening to anything (so we don't both have something playing out loud at the same time). That being said, if I need to work or concentrate, he will always switch to headphones, or move to another room. Communal rooms need to be comfortable for everyone, but if you live with someone, you need to accommodate and be considerate. It sounds like your bf didn't get that memo. \n\nNTA, but your BF is being unreasonable. Maybe you should find the cheesiest romance novel audiobook you can find (real mills & boon stuff, with a gushing narrator talking about throbbing manhoods and heaving chests) and then play the audiobook out loud any time he is being an ass about not wearing headphones. When he complains, tell him if he doesn't have to wear headphones, neither do you.", "Your wants and needs right now are not compatible. What you should do is hang out as normal with the earplugs in while he watches TikTok. The moment your ears start hurting you leave the room and don\u2019t come back. I know you want to hang out with him but you need to not be in pain, you don\u2019t need to hang out with him. When he comes looking for you you tell him you want to hang out but the earplugs hurt and I can\u2019t read when your speaker is too distracting, and you want to read too. Tell him that if he wants you to hang out with him while you read and he watches TikTok, he needs to wear the headphones. Otherwise you will only hang out for as long as the earplugs don\u2019t hurt. This is how you set a boundary.\n\nNow either he can get mad at you and say suck it up or stop reading, or he can cave and wear the headphones. If he picks option 1 you break up and if he picks option 2 you stay. If he picks option 1 and you stay, you\u2019re setting yourself up for misery and resentment until you ultimately break up.\n\nNTA", "Sit in different rooms if you can. Being together in this context is not good for you or the relationship.", "NTA", "ESH \n\nIf you\u2019re both in the room together, not focused on each other why does it bother you? I understand it\u2019s distracting for you, but then you should leave the room if it\u2019s too much for you to handle. \n\nI have ADD as well. I never made it my spouses problem. Being accommodating is on paper the right thing to do, but there\u2019s a fine line between compromising a bit and annoying the fuck out of someone by expecting them to change.", "100% this. Girlfriend and i go to bed together at night and she always reads. I read, listen to podcasts or audiobooks or just watch a stream on my phone. I wouldn't even dream of asking her to get earplugs. \n\n\n\nIf it's something where i need audio. I use my headphones. Simple as that", ">just make sure they cancel voices out as well though or his tv is going to come straight through.\n\nNC headphones don't cancel voices. They generally work well on low frequency repetitive sounds like transport.", "!!!!!!", "I have them but I\u2019m usually laying on my side, otherwise all of this would be avoided if I could do over ear on my side!", "She tried. Her option, the plugs, are physically painful. So no, I don't think she's being unreasonable asking him to use more comfortable noise control, rather than her suffering in pain, either from the ear plugs, or from the overstimulation from competing noise sources.", "They\u2019re what I use, still hurt after an hour though", "Did you try a size smaller of the bits included? That sucks they shouldn\u2019t hurt", "Literally the smallest size is all I can handle and I think they don\u2019t block the sound as well because of it :( I have really dry ears so they get irritated really easily"]}
