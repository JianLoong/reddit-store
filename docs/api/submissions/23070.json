Being a heavy sleeper, it doesn't bother me that there are children or babies on the plane. Yesterday I had an 8-hour flight and a mother with her baby sat next to me, the child was calm and it seemed that the flight was going to go without complications. The takeoff was delayed for a few minutes in which I fell asleep and woke up when they were serving the first meal. I looked to the side and saw the mother who looked frustrated then I saw the baby who was sleeping peacefully so I laughed at the cuteness but when I saw her mother, she looked at me with an angry face. I didn't understand why she was angry and I just put on my headphones and watched a series on my phone and then went back to sleep. The same thing happened for the second meal but this time she looked angrier but I thought it was understandable since the baby was crying and the people around looked just as upset and made some awkward comments, I didn't choose any meal because I didn't like the options so I went back to sleep. At the end and I was waiting for the mom to come out so I could get out (I was at the window) when the mom moves the baby and he starts crying and out of nowhere the mom starts yelling at me saying how come I slept the whole flight and I couldn't help her with her baby who cried almost the whole flight, that I was inconsiderate and couldn't help a mother in despair. I was speechless until a lady from the same flight told me that it wasn't my fault and that I shouldn\u2019t  feel bad, that the mother just let out her frustration with me. Those words encouraged me but when I told my cousin (she is a mom), she told me that in this situation I was the AH.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Unfortunately as a man you\u2019re in a lose-lose situation here. She thinks she can take her frustrations out on you because you didn\u2019t offer to help. But no doubt if you\u2019d offered help it would have been rejected and you\u2019d have been treated like you were a creep.", "ABSOLUTELY NTA, I had 3 kids under 9 on a 4hr flight when i was single. I over prepared/packed so my kids wouldnt be an issue to anyone else. If they were i was just going to figure it out and try my best. Never would i have yelled at a freaking stranger for *gasp* sleeping through a child screaming who is not theirs?! The audacity of that mother, exhausted or not!", "NTA. There is absolutely no expectation for you to help.", "NTA. Not your kid so it's not your problem. Also, did she actually ASK for help? Ever? Or did she expect a complete stranger to read her mind?", "I\u2019m so confused. You\u2019re a complete stranger to her. Why would you be expected to help with her baby? I\u2019m a mother and while I\u2019d be grateful if someone else on a plane helped me if needed, I\u2019d never expect a stranger to help! Wouldn\u2019t even occur to me to ask let alone be annoyed that the stranger didn\u2019t offer! \n\nNTA for sure! Although I\u2019m very jealous of your ability to fall asleep so easily on a plane. I\u2019d love to be able to do that!", "NTA. You sat next to a completely delusional stranger.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to take care of some random person\u2019s kid.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t even hear the baby cry. How in the world are you the AH.

As a mom who has two young kids and flew with my oldest when he was one by myself. Its so frustrating. I was prepared for I thought everything except the fact he wanted our seat neighbors blanket. I had someone waiting in line for the bathroom ask to old him to give me a short break. Is it nice when people want to help? Absolutely! Do i expect it? Abso freaking lutley not. He is my son.

I hardly accept strangers TALKING to them. Definitely NTA, and the mom needs to temper her expectations, because people will not offer her help, unless there's an emergency. That's not how society works.", "the audacity of that woman to expect you, a total stranger, to help her out with her kid. you didn't father that child and its not your responsibility. she also never asked you to help. she was an asshole and your cousin is also an asshole.", "NTA", "NTA and I must ask, what is the help they believe you could have given if awake?

Just because I have to handle two kids doesn't mean others have to jump to my side to help. They are my responsibility. I would have been happy to see that at least one person wasn't annoyed with me and my kids.", "NTA. \n\nNot your pig, not your farm.

I have flown with my kids countless times, even when they were under a year, and have never asked for nor expected help.

Not your circus.", "NTA why should you look after some random kid?", "Firstly NTA, secondly who the fuck are all these people that make commenst about babies on flights. Seriously, get the fuck over yourselves.", "NTA\n\nNot excusing, just explaining, there is a very high possibility that mother had lost her mind at that point. What she said made no sense. She was completely wrong.\n\nYour cousin is more worrisome, you don't mention that she was at the end of a long flight dealing alone with a screaming baby, so her insanity is more likely to be permanent.\n\nI'm very much of the school that we live in a society. That means if we see a person in danger (including a child) we should intervene, it means we have to accept that some people (including children) will be louder than we like, it means we should help people who are struggling if we can. None of that means that you should have stayed awake just in case a random woman might want you to help her with her baby, who was never in danger.\n\nOn the other hand, I am so envious of your sleeping power on planes, never lose that.", "Not your circus.

No?\n\nNTA", "I was waiting for OP to say it was their child or they were somehow related to the mother and child. The audacity the mother has to assume a total stranger would help with her child is unreal.

NTA OP, but the mother is TA for having such unrealistic expectations and not being prepared for a long flight with her child.", "It\u2019s almost weird if op tried helping? Somehow I think that could be viewed as more insulting or embarrassing?", ">What Mom expects a total stranger to help with their baby?!\n\nProbably, as the other woman said, one that had basically lost all sense of sanity by that point in the day. After 8 hours of not being able to calm your kid it's hard not to be a little irritated at basically anyone around you.\n\nNTA obviously, just try not to take it to heart.

I\u2019ve flown with a baby and would\u2019ve been so relieved if those around me slept through the fussy times", "Yeah, I once flew with my (at the time) 4 yr old and I was absolutely done. I had been up 24 hours, we were on our second flight out of 3 (12 hours total + 5 hrs by car) and I struggled to keep my son entertained (he had had a full blown meltdown in the airport during our layover too and refused to eat so was hungry on top of that, testing my patience to the limit). The lady in our row (I had window, my son middle, her in aisle seat) was an absolute saint and told me to nap while she coloured with him as she could tell I was barely holding on, but I wouldn't have said anything if she hadn't offered. \n\nIt's my child, not hers, and it was my job to make sure he was entertained, but when offered a chance to take a power nap in flight, hell yeah I'll take it (only slept like an hour, but it was enough to recharge), but if she hadn't, I would've manage like every other sleep deprived parent.", "I was on a flight and had severe travel sickness.

Unfortunately, you're right - that mom was NOT being reasonable.", "I envy the ability to sleep", "If the mother had asked for a small favour, like \"could you please hold the bottle while I get the bib out of my bag\" and OP had refused, I would consider that a slight AH. I'm not talking about bigger favours. Those are of course okay to refuse."]}
