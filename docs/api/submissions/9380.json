We\u2019re looking in two different neighborhoods that are an hour apart. My mom\u2019s friend is a relator in the western neighborhood and she arranged a house showing a few months ago over there but we didn\u2019t end up buying the house. She sent us about a dozen more listings via email but none were what we wanted so we didn\u2019t see them. \n\nSince then, my husband\u2019s realtor friend whose specialty is the eastern neighborhood showed us a few houses over here and talked a lot with my husband about our house search. This guy sold us our current house. \n\n2 days ago I sent my mom\u2019s friend a link to a house I was interested in, in her neighborhood, and she showed it to me yesterday. My husband wasn\u2019t able to go so I went with my parents. My dad is very handy so he looked at all the technical stuff. I loved the house and since we\u2019ve been looking for a year I know what we want and don\u2019t want. I told her we\u2019d like to put an offer down- they are due today at 6pm! And she said she\u2019s not going to put an offer down unless my husband sees it first. I took pictures and videos and my husband knows the neighborhood so him and I are both comfortable buying this house with only me seeing it (and my parents). Btw we are paying mostly cash for it, it\u2019s well within our means and our current house is about the same price so it\u2019s not the first time we\u2019re buying a house together and it\u2019s not going to put us into bankruptcy or anything. My mom also grew up in the area so we\u2019re very familiar with it. \n\nSo offers are due today but my husband decided last night that he can\u2019t go see it. Even though the lady offered to show it to him any time today before 2pm, he works and probably can\u2019t leave the office today. So he asked his relator friend to put the offer in for us. He said yes no problem! He\u2019ll put an offer in for us without us even going to see it. Because he trusts my husband. There\u2019s a small chance my husband will be able to go see it during lunch now. \n\nFirst of all, am I the only one who finds that a bit sexist that this lady refuses to put an offer down on the house based only on my opinion? I clearly discussed it with my husband on the phone in front of her and sent him a ton of pictures and he trusts my opinion. But she refused. I feel like if my husband was there instead of me, she wouldn\u2019t have had that policy. \n\nBut moreover, what do I owe my mom\u2019s friend? Am I screwing her over? My husbands relator said he can work something out with her (meaning give her a cut of the sale since she showed it to me first). Is that sufficient? Do I need to update her and tell her we\u2019re going with a different relator? I don\u2019t want to cause an issue between her and my mom.\n\nBtw, the reason she wants him to see it also is so we don\u2019t have \u2018buyers remorse\u2019\n\nUpdate- To be transparent with her, I just told her we\u2019re going with a different realtor who will put our offer in sight unseen (on my husbands part at least). Now she is calling and texting me, saying she didn\u2019t mean/didn\u2019t say that she wouldn\u2019t put the offer in, she only meant that my husband *should* see the before we put the offer in. Which I know is a lie. She explicitly told me she wouldn\u2019t put the offer in unless he goes to see it. And his window to see it was like a 12 hour window. I remember telling her well, there\u2019s a good chance he can\u2019t see it, and thinking to myself I guess we just won\u2019t put an offer down then. My mom was there and she drove the whole \u2018husbands approval\u2019 point even harder. And then the realtor tried selling me harder on the house. She wants us to put the offer in with her now, even with my husband not seeing it. I already have the offer started with the other guy and I don\u2019t want to switch again to this lady.\n\n**Another update- Now she\u2019s texting my husband and me very detailed messages with dates and times and it seems like she\u2019s gearing up for a lawsuit or something. I haven\u2019t responded since my initial response bc I\u2019m busy and my husband is at work and can\u2019t talk to her yet. Can I be sued over this?** I\u2019m at home with a crying infant and I have postpartum depression that I was really trying to get a hold of until this mess started.

You asked a service provider to provide a service.  She made a decision to not provide that service until an arbitrary condition was met (your husband's approval).  You found another service provider that didn't have that arbitrary condition and used them instead.  Sounds pretty cut and dry.\n\nAs a goodwill gesture, I would recommend that the husband's friend decide on what, if any compensation the other realtor gets.  She didn't even find the house for you, just took you to see it, so her part is small in the grand scheme of things.\n\nGood luck", "NTA - you wanted to make an offer on a house, she wouldn\u2019t do it, you found someone who would.", "NTA. Yes you are correct, this is very sexist. Go ahead and make the offer with the other realtor.", "NTA. She doesn't get to decide whether or not your husband trusts you in this. She just did herself out of a fee or commission. Her error.", "NTA - however you probably signed a contract with her basically saying you wouldn\u2019t use another realtor for houses she shows you. These are pretty standard where I am. So, she could sue you which would suck. I would look into that.", "Just be honest and tell her if she won't put in the offer you'll go with someone who will. Seems pretty simple to me.", "NTA you asked, she refused. It's unfortunate for her she didn't want to do her job. Maybe she'll learn a lesson.", "NTA. If you didn't sign a contract then you don't owe her anything. Can't have any sympathy for her considering she is refusing to make the offer without your husband seeing it, even though you and him want to make the offer.", "NTA I get that she might think she\u2019s being helpful to prevent buyers remorse, but buying site unseen is not a new concept and it\u2019s your money and your decision.  I agree that it\u2019s sexist to say you need to wait for your husband; if you both are comfortable signing on the dotted line that\u2019s all that is needed.\n\nOn a much smaller scale and not exactly the same thing, but it\u2019s kind of like when a hairdresser knows you just asked to chop all your hair off after a huge breakup. They\u2019ve seen the regret before making such a big change when emotional and can certainly caution you and ask if you\u2019re sure, but at the end of the day it\u2019s your hair and your money; they should do what you ask for. \n\nBTW my husband and I are currently moving several states away and put an offer in on a house without seeing it in person. My realtor took videos and my SIL went and toured it with me on FaceTime. They also took a ton of photos and she knows me and my tastes really well.  Between that and the Home Inspection being done today I feel comfortable. I would have been annoyed if my realtor said he didn\u2019t want to put the offer in without me flying in to go see it.", "NTA.

It's no different than a car dealer refusing to sell to you for an arbitrary reason. You are not obligated to jump through hoops for this person when you know what you want. Even if you do have some kind of realtor contract, I don't see it holding up in court since they refused to perform the service stated in the contract.", "NTA\n\nIMHO she's going over the bounds of realtor because she's your mother's friend. She has jumped into a bit of motherly role, which isn't her job. Regardless, she refused to put in an offer for you, you and your husband have agreed on this house without him seeing it. So, you're putting in an offer the way you know how.", "If she truly refused to put down the offer on the house, then NTA\n\nI know the market has changed somewhat in the last 3 years, but when we moved in June 2020, GOOD houses in our price range didn't last 2 days AND were going $10k+ over asking price.

If going with the other realtor is legal and your husband's realtor is fine with the ethics of his own actions, you are completely in the clear.

I know everything kind of just fell into this since you just so happen to know 2 realtors, however if you ever plan on moving again, dont try to use her and hopefully she isn't representing a buyer for a house you want (yes I know she'd still be obligated to bring the buyer the offer, but it would just be awkward)", "Dont put any more energy into Mom's friend.  She's unethical and she has no business controlling you in this.  You didn't say if you have a contract, so I'll assume you don't.  Now, since you did the offer through hubs friend, you have a contract.  Done.", "NTA her fault if she doesn't want to do easy cash.", "NTA. Buyers agent being competent is super important in the buying process, waaaay more so than realtor involvement in any renting. \n\nIf she wouldn\u2019t put the offer in, chances are she also won\u2019t follow up on counters or actively try to get it accepted.

Nothing. SHE broke the agreement and refused to put in an offer for you. At that point, you owe her nothing. But report her.", "NTA. She declined to put in the offer when you asked, so she forfeited the sale.  It would be *more* than generous of the other realtor to offer her any amount of his commission.", "NTA. It really does sound like the realtor has very old-fashioned ideas. I know it used to be unusual for a woman to make any of the financial decisions, but obviously if your husband signs the contract to purchase, he trusts your opinion.", "Too bad for her. She shouldn't have made a rule like that. You and your husband are a team and made a decision.  Done. Good luck with the house! I hope you get it!\n\nNTA", "NAH. I don\u2019t fault the realtor for wanting your husband to see the house, too. She\u2019s probably seen a lot of sales fall apart when only one member of a couple has seen the house. Making offers that fall apart wastes her time & the seller\u2019s time & hurts her credibility as a realtor. However, if the second realtor wants to preserve his reputation with his fellow realtors & his relationship with the first realtor, he should work something out with her.  Realtors who poach other realtors\u2019 clients make an unpleasant name for themselves in what is a very relationship driven business. That\u2019s not really your issue. Your issue is getting the house.", "YTA. You\u2019re wasting her time. I was a realtor long ago in a galaxy far away and I wouldn\u2019t show a potential client a house without a pre-approval letter from a lender and a signed buyer\u2019s agreement. You\u2019re one of the reasons why.", "She had requirements for the use of her business that didn't fit with your needs.\n\nWithout any other info, like did you tell her he couldn't make it, did you press her about the need for him to see it, did you warn her that you would just be going with a different realtor if she declined to put in your offer...\n\nNAH Business is business. She'll probably think you're an ahole tho, for not at least telling her you'd be going with a different realtor who's willing to put in your offer. But her business policies are ultimately what failed her here. Win some lose some, maybe she has a reason from her own history to require this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're not obligated to use any realtor, especially someone who was so obviously being sexist and shitty to you. I would ask the realtor you like what the general ethics are around this, I honestly don't know, but if it's all kosher on his end for him to put in your offer and cut her out, you don't need to feel guilty at all.", "NTA. I understand where she\u2019s coming from, but being that inflexible is her issue and is going to cost her money. If she knew you communicated with your husband, there\u2019s no reason to not accept your offer. Wanting both spouses to see the house is a perfectly reasonable ask. It avoids financial abuse, avoids buyers remorse, avoids a lot of things that a realtor doesn\u2019t want to be involved in. But realtors should also be flexible when a couple is obviously communicating together what they want and don\u2019t want.\n\nI would say NAH because it\u2019s her choice to not accept the offer, except she backtracked and tried to make it seem like that\u2019s not what happened.

She set her own limits that you wouldn't meet; you were totally within your right to go through another realtor. That you didn't have a signed contract totally protects you from any lawsuits. This is just her pride and loss of revenue talking. Good luck with the house!", "NTA. Unless you signed a contract with her, I don't see how she can sue you for going with a service provide that actually is providing you a service. She specifically stated that she WOULD NOT put in the offer until your husband saw the house. Her words and actions caused you to go to another service provider who provided you with the service you wanted.", "There is a lot here.

They should be doing these things for you without having to ask; and I probably even missed some. \n\nAn agent not putting in an offer when requested is them not delivering a service.

She could have said, \"I will put the offer in without your husband seeing it if you really want me to, but...\" - but it doesn't sound like she did.", "The buyer\u2019s agreement was the more relevant part of that comment.\n\nYou\u2019re also putting the new realtor in an awkward situation. It\u2019s unethical for him to work with you if you\u2019re working with another realtor. You absolutely need to tell your mom\u2019s realtor friend that you\u2019re going with someone else.", "There isn\u2019t really a standardized process for buyer\u2019s agreements (or there didn\u2019t used to be\u2026I\u2019ve been out of the business for several years). Some agents/brokerages are more lax about it than others.", "Oh well....  she refused to write an offer. Enough said.", "Oh sorry, I meant is there any professionally ethical reason he needs to loop her in on the purchase/commission/etc. I don't think so, that's just the only thing I'm not 100% sure of. You are perfectly free to put an offer down and it sounds like you want to and you should!", "Absolutely insane behavior on her part. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes! Go get that house without her lol.", "Sounds like he\u2019s the person you should be working with and he\u2019s a great agent. Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "Don\u2019t feel too bad. Real estate agents are unscrupulous vampires.", "Ya, this looks a bit...informal. Which means OP is off the hook...other than pissing off a friend of her mother's.", "Lol yes of course. Offers are due in 5 hours so we\u2019ll see how long it takes for a decision!", "Yea the way we left off was that I was going to try to get my husband to go see the house. I remember leaving being disappointed knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to see it. Btw, this house is an hour from my home and a half hour from his work. He works a very demanding job and can rarely get even a half hour off. And we have a 6 month old baby at home who I had to lug all the way to this house to see it and I asked my parents to go with me so I\u2019d have their opinion as backup, all bc I knew my husband would not be able to see the house in time. I even told this lady beforehand that my husband was unable to see the house so I\u2019m bringing my parents. Sorry to keep venting I just can\u2019t believe that there\u2019s so much pettiness and gaslighting among grown ass adults.", "I don\u2019t think we saw a single property that lasted longer than Friday-Sunday (not even hyperbole) without the offer accepted in that period. I would guess having an exclusive with buyers in that time period would build some resentment if you couldn\u2019t get them into places in that market climate.", "He did offer to give her a cut of the commission so I guess that\u2019s the ethical thing they\u2019d do. But I didn\u2019t tell her that bc idk how that\u2019ll shake out and don\u2019t want to get in the way of the good realtors payout. And she is NOT happy with me \ud83d\ude29", "Thank you. I think he is, when we run into other realtors while with him they seem to really respect him. I\u2019m sure he knows what to do in this scenario", "No need to apologize!  She should have made it perfectly clear to you that she *would* put the offer in for you.  She quite obviously did not make that clear.  If you want, you could just say that you're sorry that it seems it was just a miscommunication, but you won't be pulling your offer because you don't want to potentially lose the house as a result.  She is a business person so she should not take it personally, and use it as a learning experience in terms of how to communicate moving forward.", "I would say, if he says it's ok, do not give her any cut of the commission. She failed in her job and shouldn't get any of it. It sucks that she's not happy with you and you have a personal connection to her--but that was a really shitty thing to say and do!", "He doesn't owe her a commission, so please don't feel bad. This entire thing could have been avoided had she not been sexist and put in the offer, as you requested. \n\nShe refused to do her job. Why she should get paid for not doing her job? Why should someone else give up their commission when that person performed a service she refused to perform for you?", "\ud83d\udcaf I\u2019m a realtor and it\u2019s great to hear about someone who treats his clients and other professionals well", "She seemed very professional but I found out this is a side job for her and now I see her true colors in these voicemails and texts she\u2019s leaving for me. I told her \u2018it was my understanding that you wouldn\u2019t put the offer in for us if my husband doesn\u2019t see the house, because that\u2019s what you said\u2019 \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02", "Yea she\u2019s dumb. Lol", "Yeah, that she's calling & texting is unprofessional - anything beyond one polite response when you told her your decision is out of line.  Harassing people because you lost their business is definitely not best practice.\n\nAnd good for you for that response!", "NTA She barely did anything. Redfin pays some agents to do the leg work of showing buyers houses that the buyers themselves find. The agents barely gets paid a thousand for driving to the house and opening the door. That\u2019s all this lady did for you. If your agent is kind, he can throw her 1k for her time but she doesn\u2019t deserve more.", "Stop crying. You won't get sued. Save your text messages. Don't respond to her any longer. Not you or your husband. She is at fault not you and she knows it", "NTA: it would be one thing to say she wanted you to confirm with your husband as there may be professional reputation issues for her to consider. Doesn't make her right then either, just it's a different situation. But to not put the offer in unless your husband *saw* the house, yes, that's a problem.", "INFO - did you sign a contract with either realtor?", "NTA. You didn't say whether you signed a contract with this realtor. If you did, you owe her. If you didn't, she's SOL.  Contracts are signed for a reason and it's her bad if she didn't get you to sign one. She's just wanting the commission on the sale without the work. If you did not sign a contract, I would inform her that without a contract you owe her nothing. Every time I've gone house hunting with a realtor they had me sign a contract for 6 months first. There wad an option to cancel if the relationship was not working but we had to do that in advance of putting an offer in on a home.", "INFO::\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDid you sign a contract with either realtor?", "I wanted to say the same thing.  She cannot sue you for refusing to provide the service and you finding someone who would.   Please make sure that you block her.   You do not need threatening messages from anyone ever.    Tell your mother that she is never to bring this up to you again.    The two professional realtors will work our a finders fee if that is within their industry to do.    But that's between them.   Stay out of it.", "You basically have to be willing to buy sight unseen in some strong markets right now. Where I am, listings are being posted on Friday, offer accepted Saturday, under contract Sunday.  We didn\u2019t see ours until we were under contract, have other friends with similar experiences.", ">An agent not putting in an offer when requested is them not delivering a service. It would not be an ethics question to reach out to another realtor.\n\nThis isn't strictly correct. In real estate there's a thing called \"procuring cause\". The non-service providing agent (aka bad agent) showed the house, which in most jurisdictions (in the US anyway) indicates \"procuring cause\".\n\nBUT this isn't the buyer's problem necessarily. The \"good\" agent can and should work it out with the \"bad\" agent to avoid any future litigation or issues. The good agent seems to know this is the case and is on top of it. \n\nHopefully OP has some documentation, even if it's texts to the husband saying \"bad agent refuses to submit an offer!\" with dates and times, just in case they need a future paper trail.\n\nThe bad agent is not only a bad agent, but also an idiot, doesn't deserve to get paid, but because of the procuring cause element, may be owed something.", "Houses where I am were going up and had final offers the same day. You had to put in offers without ever seeing the home most times. When we got our house my husband saw it without me and I trusted him. He sent me video and pictures and then our realtor, his aunt, put the offer in. We were lucky he even got to see it.", "That\u2019s true- ours had us sign it only when we formally made the offer and it was specific to that property within 14 days. When renting, we\u2019d have to sign it before seeing the property.\n\nNot sure if there\u2019s any standardized agreements/methods or jurisdiction rules, but we didn\u2019t have to choose an exclusive before formally making an offer.", "I\u2019m sure the brokerage would love to hear about one of their agents losing them a chance at full commission on a property because of a personal relationship.", "The thing about procuring cause is that it doesn't have to be a written formal agreement - that's a different thing.\n\nYou're right that a lot of jurisdictions require some kind of written agreement, but I'll tell you that the majority of agents don't even understand the regulations, and they certainly don't explain or know how to explain it to consumers.", "My cousin put in an offer without her partner seeing it. He couldn't get off and trusted her. No issues, just submitted the offer. NTA"]}
