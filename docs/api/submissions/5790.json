You guys need to make some better decisions.\n\nBut if he's going to continue saving for a PS5 then why not add the cost of a night out to Olive Garden to the savings?

You need to sit him down and have a conversation because you two are either going to have huge issues in the future resulting in divorce or you resenting him. You working part time and then staying home to watch your children while he works full time is not any less than him working. Parenting is a full time position. If your husband is not splitting everything equally between the two of you after you both contribute to bills, then he is financially abusing you. That includes the door dash, in which you are caring for the children while he delivers. However, if you two are splitting everything equally and you are blowing your portion on yourself (not things the children need), then you would be the A.

I feel like I can give useful input on this. He wants a PS5 and should be able to save for that, and I think you've voiced your feelings pretty well about feeling like he isn't prioritizing your dating life. I think that making it about the PS5 could cause him to get defensive and he might take it personal that you don't want him spending money on things he wants. You should tell him, without mentioning the PS5, that going on a date is something really important to you and that it's something you should both prioritize and budget together. Maybe sit down and budget with him and help him with the PS5 budget. This is a team effort. Also, as a last resort, you can just ask sincerely if he would seriously consider allocating some PS5 funds for a date night next month. I think he's just not understanding how important it is to you. If he did get your hints, I'd like to think he would prioritize it. So give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he's not getting the hints and tell him straight up.", "Damn girl, take yourself to Olive Garden since your husband won\u2019t!

I hope it's just a phase and he'll come around.", "NTA. I would do just like you said and take yourself. Maybe take a family member or friend and leave the kiddos at home with him.

He is.   \nIf he can't even meet your needs just so he can keep himself entertained with material things, that'd be enough for me to end things.   \nYou shouldn't have to keep asking to go out to eat with him, to spend time with him.
