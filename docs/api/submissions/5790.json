My husband is saving his Christmas money and plans to DoorDash to save more. Money is tight but we do have the money to do some fun things. I\u2019m dying to be asked on a date to Olive Garden because I have good memories there. \n\nI think I\u2019m just feeling jealous that he\u2019s willing to put a lot of time and effort into investing in a gaming system.

You guys need to make some better decisions.\n\nBut if he's going to continue saving for a PS5 then why not add the cost of a night out to Olive Garden to the savings?

You need to sit him down and have a conversation because you two are either going to have huge issues in the future resulting in divorce or you resenting him. You working part time and then staying home to watch your children while he works full time is not any less than him working. Parenting is a full time position. If your husband is not splitting everything equally between the two of you after you both contribute to bills, then he is financially abusing you. That includes the door dash, in which you are caring for the children while he delivers.

I feel like I can give useful input on this. He wants a PS5 and should be able to save for that, and I think you've voiced your feelings pretty well about feeling like he isn't prioritizing your dating life. I think that making it about the PS5 could cause him to get defensive and he might take it personal that you don't want him spending money on things he wants. You should tell him, without mentioning the PS5, that going on a date is something really important to you and that it's something you should both prioritize and budget together. Maybe sit down and budget with him and help him with the PS5 budget. This is a team effort. Also, as a last resort, you can just ask sincerely if he would seriously consider allocating some PS5 funds for a date night next month. I think he's just not understanding how important it is to you. If he did get your hints, I'd like to think he would prioritize it.

I hope it's just a phase and he'll come around.", "NTA. I would do just like you said and take yourself. Maybe take a family member or friend and leave the kiddos at home with him.

He is.   \nIf he can't even meet your needs just so he can keep himself entertained with material things, that'd be enough for me to end things.   \nYou shouldn't have to keep asking to go out to eat with him, to spend time with him.

Cash envelopes, apps (I cannot recommend YNAB, or You Need A Budget, highly enough), whatever. I feel like a cult member, but I love my budget. Everything takes money, unfortunately, and you want to be sure you\u2019re spending it in a way that aligns with your goals and values. I love that my husband and I have a his, hers, and ours fun money fund. He doesn\u2019t care what I do with my money, I don\u2019t care what he does with his, and he doesn\u2019t care what I do with mine.", "She is already responsible for child care while he works extra for his toys. My dad did this my whole life- always had a side hustle in evenings/weekends- mostly helping farmers out.  Cool, right?  Except 100% of that money went to HIS hobbies and such, even though MOM was paying for or providing child care while he did that. \n\nIts all good for couples to separate blow money- but it needs to be a PORTION of the income.  Not all of it- so the person working gets all the benefit and the person at home is making all the sacrifice.", "She wants him to want to take her to Olive Garden enough that he\u2019s willing to DoorDash for it, but he\u2019s using his side gig money for his PS5.", "My grandma still gives me lucky money every time I see her. Do I need the money? No. Does grandma care? Also no.", "Exactly! Not to mention working part time she is screwed if they divorce. She\u2019s been mostly rearing the kids and her 401k and income potential have completely changed (age much less) while his gets to grow.s9 by the Tim they\u2019re both 65 he will be fine and she won\u2019t be.", "I am not making fun of olive garden. I am explaining to someone who knows nothing about olive garden what olive garden is.", "Waiting for someone to do what you want makes no sense. She is the one that wants to go ro Olive Garden. Then she should take him.", "Here is what they do, from my understanding. They pool their money. She keeps track of bill due dates. He makes sure the bills get paid. The spread the rest into envelopes for spending. I don't see him keeping all the money.\n\nEdit to add, maybe they are planning in implementing the envelopes, but have not started that yet? Anyway, it does sound like they are trying to be fair about how the spending money is split. I do agree his extra shifts or job would only be possible due to her being home, so then I wonder would he make himself available if she wanted to pick up extra shifts if she wanted to also save for her own self?", "Tell him that you're thinking of inviting a divorce attorney along with you.\n\nYou are not in a good financial place and many (if not most) marriages flounder on the finances.\n\nAnyone who is wasting the money on a gaming system when they are regularly in the financial hole... can't afford to continue living like that (putting fun before family).\n\nNTA", "And she does not have the opportunity to earn extra becasue she is taking care of their kids while he does Door Dash. He needs to share that income with her, or pay a sitter so she can work too.", "Why? it's like a gift card without the extra steps", "A game system is NOT an investment.", "I do understand why you'd suggest telling him, but honestly, she's told him a million times she wants to go and he apparently didn't even ask why or doesn't care. Why spoon feed it to him even more. Dude is having ps5 tunnel vision and if he's already like that BEFORE having the ps5 I really don't wanna know how he'll set his priorities once he has it. Ps5 sounds like a death sentence to any kind of intimacy and caring coming from him in this relationship.", "As far as I understood, they split the income and each keeps money in an envelope. (Whatever is left over is free spending). So, he shares.", "Eh. Sometimes it simply takes spoon feeding to get someone to eat. If all he sees it as is a $50 dollar dinner, that he doesn\u2019t have any real interest in, while moneys already tight and he\u2019s working extra to get something he does want, then not only is it not important to him but he has a reason to actively not want to go. If she\u2019s clear that it\u2019s about investment in their relationship, spending time together and doing something that she enjoys, WITH HIM because she wants to have a positive experience with the man she loves, that\u2019s a whole different thing to say no to than \u201cbabe I wanna go to Olive Garden\u201d for the 10th time when he knows he can\u2019t afford it. If she spells it out and he see it\u2019s not just about going to eat at Olive Garden, which it clearly isn\u2019t, he has a chance to know what he\u2019s rejecting, and it\u2019s clearly more than dinner. If she goes through the effort of explaining why it\u2019s important and he misses it again, she\u2019s no worse than she is now. And if he gets it and it clicks when it\u2019s laid out in simple terms, it\u2019s totally worth it even if admittedly she shouldn\u2019t have to. Kinda just went down the \u201csince we\u2019re here how do we make it better\u201d route instead of the \u201cit shouldn\u2019t be like this in the first place\u201d", "Your point is good, but OP also works part-time.", "She works too. She has a part time job AND is likely primary caregiver. Her income and earning potential is already \nOwner than his bc of all the sacrifices she\u2019s made financially (and she will be utterly screwed if they divorce) to do the child rearing. He\u2019s got 401k piling up at a faster rate than her. Dude can spring for a cheap meal at Olive Garden (cripes she\u2019s not even asking for a meal at a Michelin star). She wants his time and a date night. The least the man can do for being pregnant twice and birthing and raising their kids.", "Alrighty Ebenezer lol", "Yea, but the logic still works. She said she works PT and is PT with the kids, meaning her fixed time at work is 4hrs and the rest are with the kids. So that's 24hrs minus 4hrs at work, so 20hrs remaining to be with the kids (minus commute and slight buffer).\n\nI don't think OP is communicating her situation well. But reading between the lines, the husband is pretty selfish for willing to save $500+ for a PS5 but not willing to commit to the wife for a $60 dinner.", "Op is literally begging Reddit lol. Get real.", "NTA. If you start an Olive Garden go fund me, I will help send you. He is being mean and selfish.", "ESH- you two need to budget and spend and talk more as a team. You shouldn't have to beg him to go on a date, but you're taking no initiative other than whining at him to do it. The game system matters to him, so he's working extra to buy it. That's how men think. If you want a date night, save up, plan it, make it happen.", "NTA - talk to your husband about how you feel. Tell him what you told Reddit. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t see it that way and will likely be surprised that you do. But hopefully you\u2019ll get your date soon after.", "NTA, but maybe a bit of a correction from Hallmark mode is in order. Yes, it is great when husbands wine and dine.. and keep the romance alive like the movies. But waiting to be \"surprised\" that he's taking his little pot of money to spend on you (and being so disappointed that he didn't think of this) is setting him up for failure. Yes, it can seem like he's a bit immature in seeking the PS5 as his personal savings goal when life with kids are increasingly complicated and demanding of his time. But a frank conversation and collaborative plan to spend time and money on date nights as part of your collective budgeting makes more sense than begrudging him his savings goal. You both need to incorporate date nights as part of the core budget, not his budget. It is less romantic, but no less important to a healthy marriage.", "NTA. He's going to do Door Dash and you're going to be home alone with the kids even more, and he feels bad asking your family to watch the kids so you could go out to dinner. You're not jealous of the PS5, you're sick of being neglected.", "This sounds like an advertisement for olive garden, you just forgot to mention the unlimited sticks, soups, and salads deal.", "Save up and take yourself. Make him keep the kids. Maybe he\u2019ll appreciate you then", "Its a tricky one. It's his money from outside of your normal income. So I guess its his to do with what he wants. But then he is also being irresponsible spending that money on a luxury, if you are struggling for money. \n\nLike other people have said, you two need to make a budget.   Try to factor in eating out if that's something that matters to you. But don't dismiss what he wants, and he obviously really wants that PS5 if he doing extra side jobs to afford it. \n\nAlso the PS5 is definitely a waste of money, Xbox series is king this generation. And PC over all else.", "DUDE! TAKE YOUR GIRL TO OLIVE GARDEN!", "NTA- you are asking for a date that isn\u2019t even expensive to feel important to him. He\nclearly doesn\u2019t feel like something you asked to do as a couple is important at all - I\u2019d be hurt too. If it took a few weeks longer to save for his game - is that a big deal to take his wife\u2019s feelings into consideration? Leaving her with the kids to do a side hustle so he can get his game sooner.. ouch. I guess I would feel like it\u2019s all about him, too. If you felt he cared about you at all - you\u2019d probably be willing to help him buy the game\u2026 it\u2019s just dividing you at this point.", "This. His priorities are way out of whack if you\u2019re barely making it by and he is saving for a ps5.  Y\u2019all need to be saving for an emergency. Especially having kids.  Jesus.", "What would a date night there have cost, fifty bucks? If he gets eight bucks' profit in tips per night, he could have literally waited one more week.", "Seriously - all the comments saying that \"the PS5 is an investment and something the whole family can do!\" are delusional. The man can't even be arsed to take his wife on a date after she's begged him; he's certainly not going to include her in his gaming. \n\nAnd I am saying this as someone who bought their spouse a Switch that he now uses with our kids all the time.", "Thank you for this rabbit hole!

Much love", "Her staying home with the kids allows him to work that second gig. Half of it is hers.", "Love, the fact that you have to beg your man to take you to OLIVE GARDEN proves the bar is so low it's in hell.", "Maybe he doesn\u2019t care for their food. It\u2019s not a very good restaurant. If I was on a budget I wouldn\u2019t spend my hard earned money on a shitty meal. I\u2019d rather go to the movies or play pool.", "My SO and I have a shared account which we use for all household and joint expenses,  then we have our own separate accounts.", ">  Olive Garden was by far the tastiest meal I had while there\n\nGood for you man happy you had a good time but you were robbed of a good dining experience if Olive garden was the best meal lmao.", "I don\u2019t even like PS5s and I would go the opposite direction. I play PC and Nintendo switch games, and I have never owned a PlayStation and I don\u2019t want one. \n\nBut Olive Garden is so bad, I would rather spend $700 on a PS5 I would never use than have to eat there. But also they don\u2019t cost $700. They\u2019re more like $500. \n\nOlive Garden\u2019s food is horrendous. Every single thing I\u2019ve eaten there is either too dry, too greasy, too bland, etc. Nothing about their food is balanced or authentic. The breadsticks taste like cardboard. I\u2019ve never eaten something there and enjoyed it.", "Um, I hope two envelopes. You each get the same each month after bills are paid. You can use that to buy treats for yourself like takeout, video games etc. Anything non-essential. And yes EACH of you gets your own to save or spend as you like. Since you\u2019re watching your kids, I think any side job money should also be split unless he\u2019s willing to give you the same opportunity by watching his kids", "Yeah, she needs to prioritize her own happiness real quick, because he won\u2019t even notice she is alive once he gets that thing", "Then she should take him\u2026.did I not say that\u2026.?", "That seemed like the point to me...", "Let me guess, single?", "Frankly, he needs to be willing to give her the same opportunity to earn extra income.. or share his side job income 50-50.", "Two for discretionary spending \u2014 one for each person!", "She's been asking him. It says right in the OP.", "No LOL, the point of the post is she wants to go and he won't take her because he's saving all their extra money for a PS5. It has nothing to do with your opinion of the food quality at Olive Garden.", "Wow planning a date to olive garden is soooooo hard", "PlayStation is years worth of entertainment. It\u2019s a good investment. Kids can play. Even the oP can okay. Or they can go eat at a restaurant that has the same level of quality as McDonalds. Hmm tough choice.", "Yep, hence my initial comment. Lol.", "I don't think he keeps all the money- but it sounds like he is keeping all the side hustle money. For his toy.", "I get that, and I agree, but the thing is what she's asking for isn't necessarily Olive Garden, she's dropping hints that she just wants to be taken out on a date.", "They have two children and she gives up working full time (and being way more financially independent) to care for THE CHILDREN THEY SHARE. He doesn't pay her a dime for that. But he still zealously counts \"his portion\" of the spending money?", "Then he ought to explain it to her and get her \"buy in\" emotionally as well as financially. I also agree Olive Garden is a crap option. I read that as OP deliberately not asking for very much. It seems like there's not much relationship here anymore.", "Not everyone understands hints, so, again She. Needa. To. Do. It. Herself.", "Olive garden is one day. PS5 is like 10 years", "They have two kids, probably quite young judging from parent\u2019s ages. I have two children under 8. Door dash would be considerably easier than doing the dinner/homework/bath/bed routine on my own.", "Yeah, I agree in this case. A Switch as a family system would make a lot more sense, especially since it's a lot less pricey. I can - and *have -* sunk a hell of a lot of time doing split screen Minecraft with my younger cousins on my Switch. We even had a camping trip once in which it started raining in the late afternoon, so we stayed in the tent playing Minecraft (on separate Switches; that was a couple years later). \n\nA PS5 is much more geared towards solo or online games rather than casual couch multiplayer. And hey, nothing against the guy getting one, but with his wife asking about going out to dinner with him, he could have taken her to Olive Garden and waited a whole one extra week to get the PS5.", "She's been explicitly telling him \"I want you to take me to Olive Garden\".", "If the hint to do something specifically that you want them to do _for_ you, not just something you want done, the trick is not to do it for them, it is to be more explicit.", "Except for his side hustle funds is how I read it.
