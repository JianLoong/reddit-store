I haven't got any kids. He has got a 4year old son who lives with his mom(my bf's ex). My boyfriend fetches his son every weekend. He has recently introduced me to his son. We get along really well. He's sweet & very talkative. \nI have helped raise my nieces & nephews, so I think that I  am good with kids. I don't believe in hitting kids. We talk things through. This has been my approach with my bf's son too.\n\nHe is always up to something, taking things apart or pressing buttons, but that's because he's curious. I always speak to him calmly & have started explaining things to him. So now, he asks me questions like \"what does this do?\" \"What is this?\", and we explore things together (less things being broken). \n\n I recently received a call from the mother of my boyfriend son, a\u2078sking me to stop using all these \"new age phrases\" on her child. She said that my \"funny things\" are interfering with her parenting style. Apparently the boy said \"Don't shout Mommy. Speak soft like Auntie.\" He also said \"ok. take a deep breathe mommy\" whenever she would raise her voice at him. At first I told her that I wasn't trying to interfere with her parenting style, but that that is how I deal with children. She told me to \"go make my own kids and then teach them shit.\" That hurt me and I told her that maybe her parenting style needs an update. \n\nNow, she refuses to let the child be around me. She is starting to refuse my bf access to his son, because of my interference. My friend thinks that I shouldn't have told her that her parenting needs an update & let my bf handle this instead.

We women can be so terrible to one another when it comes to parenting. Everything is a problem and no-one is respectable when it comes to watching other people parent. It's a sad state in society that I would urge you not to participate in.\n\nBut the reality is that she's a bit unhinged and this custody thing is going to be a problem.\n\nEvery divorce has a custory arrangement. If she denies Dad his time with the child, he needs to bring her to court. She'll likely bend when she realizes that it's being brought to court, but if she doesn't, the likely result will be that he ends up with full custody.

The mothers is the A hole for using her child as a pawn. Thats incredibly disappointing. Based off the child's responses it also seems like she loses her temper and takes it out on the child.

How bad does it have to be that a freaking 4 year old knows how you talk to people and a grown adult can\u2019t comprehend that.\n\nShe might have her views on parenting- I get that (well as she\u2019s beating and screaming at him not really tho) but she cannot force the father and his new gf to be just as abusive.\n\nOP didn\u2019t do anything except defend herself and did not speak badly about the mother in front of the child. \n\nSo why are you projecting \ud83e\udd74", "Exactly!  \nEven though her technique is working (that's a good thing, indeed and makes her N T A,) it doesn't give her the right to tell the child's mother that she's doing a shitty job of raising her son. That right there = YTA.", "She didn\u2019t insult, she informed. She said that her parenting needs an update after she got HEAVLY insulted for taking care in a more nurturing way. I start thinking that YOU\u2018re the AH in this thread.", "Imagine defending a mom screaming at a 4 year old kid or laying hands on him.\n\nThat is you. You just defended that behaviour.\n\nAlso, if there is a visit agreement, you just defended shredding that too.\n\nSee yourself out to the nearest dixi.", "Refraining from abusing kids is being on a high horse? Yikes.", "Lol oops, you are correct.", "Op shouldn\u2019t be trying to parent a child that isn\u2019t here when clearly, she wasn\u2019t given permission to do so. She\u2019s been dating this man for a year. She needs to stop trying to be a step mummy.", "Hard disagree. She is just a girlfriend, and a newer one at that.  She's acting like she is on the same footing as someone who has actually joined this child's family and she has not. There's a decent chance she never will, which makes it even more innappropriate for her to undermine the decisions made by the child's mom. Sleeping with a child's dad for a few months absolutely does not give her the right to have a say in how the child is raised. If she wants more control over the child, she needs to have the child's parents decide whether she has earned that right yet. The fact that the boyfriend only recently let OP meet the child strongly suggests he is not ready to have her take on the decision-making role she is attempting to have.", "Good bot", "Exactly my thoughts. You\u2019re never the AH for caring for a child.", "What should she have done? Simple. I\u2019ll even spell it out for you: \n\n\u201cYou need to talk to boyfriend about that. I need to go.\u201d [hang up]\n\nThat\u2019s what she should have said. Instead, she CHOSE to get into a fight with her boyfriend\u2019s kid\u2019s mom. She CHOSE to call her a bad parent. She CHOSE to start drama. She CHOSE to be an asshole. YTA", "People who think explaining concepts to kids and speaking calmly to them is \u201cwoke\u201d ARE bad parents and should be told so lmao. Becoming pregnant/impregnating someone doesn\u2019t make you a good parent. Just makes you a parent. I\u2019m glad OP was there so the kid could learn some kindness.", "So she should...ignore the child? Treat him like a stranger? Keep her distance and give him the cold shoulder? What is this alternative you're suggesting?\n\nThe father of this child made the decision to bring his girlfriend into his son's life. It doesn't sound like she overstepped or tried to \"be a step mummy\", it sounds like she's tried to be kind and caring for a CHILD. The alternative is more of what his actual mother gives him, which appears to be an earful and a complex.\n\nOP is not an AH for being a decent person, and it's not her fault the mother is upset that she can demonstrate basic compassion and understanding to her kid. OP is right, perhaps she *should* try the same. NTA x infinity ffs.", "I see you\u2019re speaking from a place of insecurities.\n\nWhy would you refer to a year long relationship to \u201csleeping with a child\u2019s parent for a few months\u201d.\nYou absolutely have no right to judge them on their relationship. If that\u2019s how YOU view relationships that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t assume everyone has the same mindset.\n\nAnd you still are unable to say how she interfered with the mothers parenting style.\nThe mother called HER. Which is extremely inappropriate in itself. But then she blames the gf that her child just doesn\u2019t want to be screamed at. \n\nShocking : no child wants to be screamed at and it usually doesn\u2019t help but results in mental health problems.\n\nHitting or screaming at you children IS a very traditional and old parenting style. But if it works for you go ahead. I doubt that the father agrees with that parenting style though, and he at least has as much of a say as the mother. \n\nSo whatever goes on in their house- is THEIR business. If they don\u2019t want to scream at the poor child- guess what you can\u2019t force them to.\nIf they child will prefer to stay at their house or for the mom to act more like the gf- that\u2019s HIS request and frankly, not surprising", "Why do I feel like you\u2019re the ex here? \ud83d\ude02", "She did not choose the fight, the ex did. The ex was the asshole here; see, OP tried to deescalate by having a reasonable conversation about the situation, but the instigating ex chose to start a fight when she snapped back with something completely uncalled for. Quite frankly, if somebody says \"go make your own kids and teach them shit\" to you when you've been nothing but kind and respectful to a child, they threw the first stone and fuck their feelings. OP worded her response a lot more kindly than some would have.", "How many children do you have and are you a co-parent?", "Not sure why you think this is a debate sub. But it isn\u2019t. Not sure why you are so worked up about MY opinion. But you know what it never was? That serious.", "You seem to be the one speaking from a place of insecurities. People in uncommitted or less-committed relationships need to understand their limits, particularly if the relationship is newer and they have only recently been allowed to meet the other person's family members. Too many girlfriends asssume they can begin acting like a second wife and stepmom immediately upon getting a boyfriend and believe they can take over parenting decisions but it's incredibly inappropriate.\n\nIf the child's father has a problem with how the mother is treating his child, he needs to be the one to address that, not the girlfriend who just met the child. The child is not hers and if she can't accept and follow the decisions the child's parents make she needs to rethink being in a relationship with someone who has kids that aren't hers.", "Thank you for admitting my points are valid.", "Lol think you need to try glasses. Becauses I did no such thing. You clearly have issues.", "My issue? You mean not wanting to call a woman an asshole for being a good person? Ya know what, I'm cool with that."]}
