I haven't got any kids. He has got a 4year old son who lives with his mom(my bf's ex). My boyfriend fetches his son every weekend. He has recently introduced me to his son. We get along really well. He's sweet & very talkative. \nI have helped raise my nieces & nephews, so I think that I  am good with kids. I don't believe in hitting kids. We talk things through. This has been my approach with my bf's son too.\n\nHe is always up to something, taking things apart or pressing buttons, but that's because he's curious. I always speak to him calmly & have started explaining things to him. So now, he asks me questions like \"what does this do?\" \"What is this?\", and we explore things together (less things being broken). \n\n I recently received a call from the mother of my boyfriend son, a\u2078sking me to stop using all these \"new age phrases\" on her child. She said that my \"funny things\" are interfering with her parenting style. Apparently the boy said \"Don't shout Mommy. Speak soft like Auntie.\" He also said \"ok. take a deep breathe mommy\" whenever she would raise her voice at him. At first I told her that I wasn't trying to interfere with her parenting style, but that that is how I deal with children. She told me to \"go make my own kids and then teach them shit.\" That hurt me and I told her that maybe her parenting style needs an update. \n\nNow, she refuses to let the child be around me. She is starting to refuse my bf access to his son, because of my interference. My friend thinks that I shouldn't have told her that her parenting needs an update & let my bf handle this instead. I feel terrible.

We women can be so terrible to one another when it comes to parenting. Everything is a problem and no-one is respectable when it comes to watching other people parent. It's a sad state in society that I would urge you not to participate in.\n\nBut the reality is that she's a bit unhinged and this custody thing is going to be a problem.\n\nEvery divorce has a custory arrangement. If she denies Dad his time with the child, he needs to bring her to court. She'll likely bend when she realizes that it's being brought to court, but if she doesn't, the likely result will be that he ends up with full custody.

The mothers is the A hole for using her child as a pawn. Thats incredibly disappointing. Based off the child's responses it also seems like she loses her temper and takes it out on the child.

If teaching the kid to use different techniques to calm down and encouraging his inquisitiveness in a way that encourages learning is new age then I guess it\u2019s time for me to find some crystals and learn to meditate. I follow a mom on instagram that does that with her child and very rarely does the child have a complete meltdown. The kid is only two so it\u2019s impressive that there are so many ways to get a child to understand what is happening and what needs to be done without a crying fit.", "INFO: What is your BF'S take on this?\nAlso not the NTA, the approach you have taken is correct not only as a third-party caretaker but as a parent all together. Good job Op.", "Not gonna lie it took me 20 minutes to figure out the first line of this. Either way right now I\u2019m too confused to cast my vote", "You know what\u2026. This comment right here!!! I understand why one should tread lightly when critiquing parenting styles- obviously only the parent who deals 24/7(or 24/5 for those with shared custody) with a child can fully know the difficulties of being a perfect model parent at all times, & parents can have bad days just like all humans - but at the same time we should normalize calling out parents for their shitty behavior, especially if it\u2019s habitual & routine enough to continuously affect their child\u2019s behavior and emotional health. Parents should also be able to take constructive criticism and look inward to tweak their parenting performance. It\u2019s something that\u2019s expected  in our society for other aspects of life, and parenting shouldn\u2019t be the exception (ex. work, school, other interpersonal relationships). critiquing parents behaviors towards their kids does not equates to a lack of compassion for the difficulties of parenting, but parents should be self aware enough to know when a reactive behavior, such as screaming, is not okay & know when to apologize to a child when they cross such a line - because, personally, there is no greater pet peeve than adults treating kids like they aren\u2019t human, and in turn excusing abusive behaviors.\n\nEdit: spelling", "EX can't stand that OP is a better parent than she is. Apparently, she's yelling a lot along with the threats. It might be time to rethink the visitation schedule if she's going to blackmail the boyfriend. Start writing things down to build a case, as long as your bf is on board. She thinks she gets to control every interaction her child has. She has no right to tell you how to speak with a child, especially since she sounds controlling and borderline abusive. NTA", "I was 5, my mom tried to use my little sister and I to hurt my dad and essentially extort him to pay an absurd amount of money. \n\nJokes on her though, I moved in with my dad full time at 11 and became an attorney because I was so angry at what she had done. \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA, OP. Ex is being super petty and your parenting style sounds like mine. My son is 3. He's an intelligent and curious little person trying to figure out the world. Patience is a must with small children and you sound like a wonderful friend/stepmom!", "are you dense? Just because he's not on the birth certificate means nothing if he's the father he can go to court asking for a DNA test and something tells me evidence knowingly lying to the judge about paternity to fudge custody agreements won't turn out well", "Sometimes my son when young would work my last nerve.  To stop from losing my cool on him, I'd go in the bathroom and lock the door - just in need of a few minutes.  And he'd bang on the door, and his little fingers would reach under the door.  OMG.  But it usually helped me not yell at him.", "When my son was about five and over all this stuff, my husband said to me, 'Why don't you fully close the bathroom door when you go in there?' \n\n'Because I've had YEARS of meltdowns if I was out of contact for even five seconds!'\n\nThose little fingers under the door!"]}
