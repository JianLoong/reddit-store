I haven't got any kids. He has got a 4year old son who lives with his mom(my bf's ex). My boyfriend fetches his son every weekend. He has recently introduced me to his son. We get along really well. He's sweet & very talkative. \nI have helped raise my nieces & nephews, so I think that I  am good with kids. I don't believe in hitting kids. We talk things through. This has been my approach with my bf's son too.\n\nHe is always up to something, taking things apart or pressing buttons, but that's because he's curious. I always speak to him calmly & have started explaining things to him. So now, he asks me questions like \"what does this do?\" \"What is this?\", and we explore things together (less things being broken). \n\n I recently received a call from the mother of my boyfriend son, a\u2078sking me to stop using all these \"new age phrases\" on her child. She said that my \"funny things\" are interfering with her parenting style. Apparently the boy said \"Don't shout Mommy. Speak soft like Auntie.\" He also said \"ok. take a deep breathe mommy\" whenever she would raise her voice at him. At first I told her that I wasn't trying to interfere with her parenting style, but that that is how I deal with children. She told me to \"go make my own kids and then teach them shit.\" That hurt me and I told her that maybe her parenting style needs an update. \n\nNow, she refuses to let the child be around me. She is starting to refuse my bf access to his son, because of my interference. My friend thinks that I shouldn't have told her that her parenting needs an update & let my bf handle this instead.

You haven't changed every diaper, stayed up in the middle of the night countless times, fed her every day, watched her grow every day. Commenting from the outside on her parenting style is just mean. We women can be so terrible to one another when it comes to parenting. Everything is a problem and no-one is respectable when it comes to watching other people parent. It's a sad state in society that I would urge you not to participate in.\n\nBut the reality is that she's a bit unhinged and this custody thing is going to be a problem.\n\nEvery divorce has a custory arrangement. If she denies Dad his time with the child, he needs to bring her to court. She'll likely bend when she realizes that it's being brought to court, but if she doesn't, the likely result will be that he ends up with full custody.

The mothers is the A hole for using her child as a pawn. Thats incredibly disappointing. Based off the child's responses it also seems like she loses her temper and takes it out on the child.

OP's style with the kid is wonderful, and that is WHY it's really too bad she jeopardized her time with him by blowing up at his mom. Yeah, I would say the mom's parenting style is in fact bad (not wanting other kindly adults to \"teach her kids shit\" definitely argues that), and so OP didn't say anything \"undeserved\" per se, she only made a tactical mistake... but geez, that's a big tactical mistake, one that is bad for the child. She should have had more maturity.", "Most commenters are confused.  The issue is not how OP treats the son.  The issue is that she has opened up her big mouth and created additional conflict in an already fraught situation.  The result of which is that her BF is losing parenting time.

I'm not gonna say \"spanking is abuse\", I get the idea behind it and the history. But that stems from abusive, unproductive behavior that should not continue. Period. There's no amount of \"being the actual biological parent\" can excuse unproductive, abusive behavior and also clearly bad communication. \n\nBeing a parent doesn't actually make you an expert in being a parent, See reference: bad parents.", "This. It's really easy to criticize someone else's parenting when the only \"parenting\" you've ever had to do is caring for a child minimally part-time with the full support of a loving partner.

It's easy to say, \"You should never yell at your child.\" It's also easy to be the perfect parent when you've never had to parent around the clock, by yourself . . . and have it made WORSE by a co-parent's new partner shaming you for being human and fallible. \n\nAnd I say this as someone who was a lot like OP. I don't have kids of my own, but I've worked with young kids for over 30 years, and helped raise my niblings as well. And I used to be just as self-righteous about parents I thought were \"harsh\" and \"not patient enough\" . . . until I grew up a little and REALLY STARTED WATCHING AND LISTENING to my sister, the actual parent. And she was really smart when she gently pointed out to me that as wonderful as I was with her kids, and as much as she appreciated all that I did (including bedtimes, school runs, sick days . . . all the tough stuff), I didn't have to do it 24/7/365. I didn't have to take care of the sick kids when I was also really sick and trying not to vomit; I didn't have to do the school run if I was too exhausted.

OP isn't the one that has to ultimately follow through on any punishments or discipline, and if she was then she might find she falls into a 4 year old's definition of \"yelling\" as well.\n\nThe \"Ok, take a deep breath mommy\" line sounds incredibly coached by OP, especially combined with the mom's wording regarding \"new age phrases\".
