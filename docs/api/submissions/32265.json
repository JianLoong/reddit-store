We\u2019ve been friends for a few years now, we\u2019re not best friends but we\u2019re part of a larger friend group so we hang out a few times a month. \n\nShe had a HUGE wedding and a huge bridal party. I wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid (thank god) because she has a lot of high school and college friends, but I was invited to the bachelorette party. I declined, because it was bar hopping in Nashville and I no longer drink. Plus her wedding was a destination already (Caribbean) and I couldn\u2019t make both work financially. \n\nHer wedding happened to fall on the same day as my 30th birthday. I wasn\u2019t too bothered by this because I figured it\u2019d be cool to be in a tropical place for my birthday anyway, plus a lot of my friends were invited so I\u2019d get to celebrate with them anyway. \n\nWhen the bride realized she had booked it in my birthday last year, I remember she got kind of quiet and then said something like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I did that but I\u2019d appreciate if you celebrated the day before or after instead of on my wedding day.\u201d Again, didn\u2019t really have a problem with that. \n\nI don\u2019t use social media very much, I was playing the comparison game too much but this last year I really worked on myself and I\u2019m feeling more fit than ever before. I got a really nice dress for the wedding and I felt amazing in my skin for the first time. I decided to have one of my friends take some pictures of me on the beach at sunrise the morning of the wedding/birthday so I could have some good pics of me. I always hated taking photos because of low self esteem and I just was really feeling myself for the first time. \n\nA few of us who weren\u2019t in the wedding did a little birthday breakfast together on the beach. It wasn\u2019t a big thing, just five or six of us. My friends made me a little picnic. Got some great photos there too and I felt really happy. I decided to post the beach pics and the breakfast ones on IG. It was my first post in probably 2 years. \n\nThe wedding happened and then a few days later, I got some really angry texts from the bride. She said I broke my promise that I wouldn\u2019t celebrate on her wedding day, that I was trying to steal her thunder, and that I didn\u2019t even have the decency to post anything from her wedding when all our other friends did. She was on her honeymoon when she was texting me all this. \n\nShe said she had already been upset with me for not going to the bachelorette and basically called me a bad friend. I\u2019m really confused and hurt. It wasn\u2019t my intention to make her upset, I guess I did technically break my promise not to do anything on my birthday but I guess I just didn\u2019t think it was a big deal since it was just a breakfast. \n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR: my friend got married on my birthday, asked me to postpone any celebrations but my friends threw me a birthday picnic on the beach, I posted about it and now she\u2019s upset with me", "created_utc": 1701618202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189w4hw/aita_for_posting_about_my_birthday_and_not_my/", "score": 283, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She booked her wedding on your birthday which is neither here nor there because one has nothing to do with the other but then she had the nerve to demand you don't celebrate on your own birthday because she's a bride? Frankly, that's when you should have told her to take a long hike off a short pier however having a birthday breakfast on the beach is hardly partying it up. What kind of a spoilt, entitled brat thinks they can demand other people don't celebrate their own birthdays in whichever way they choose just because they happen to coincide with her wedding day? Some women really could do with a reality check on how little their big days actually matter to most other people. Oh yeah sure, attending a wedding is nice, but really, other than the wedding party for most other people it's a nice party where you get to dress up and have a good time with friends and family. It is not the most important thing in really anyone but the bride and groom's lives. And as for this throwing a tantrum because people can't make a bachelorette party. that's just silly.\n\nBut you have to feel a bit sorry for her really, if she's spending her honeymoon checking out all her friend's Instagrams - how else would she know - and firing off nasty texts if they haven't published enough adoration of her then it can't be much of a honeymoon.\n\nI'd simply ignore her, anyone who treats other people like this over something as ridiculously trivial as this is not someone you should invest any time or energy worrying about. You're not the bad friend here. She is.", "What a strange reaction. My good friends got married the day before my birthday and ended up coming out to celebrate my birthday the day after their wedding, which I in no way expected but of course very much appreciated. Now, years later, we exchange happy anniversary/birthday texts every year--we always remember each other's thing because of the proximity.

Don't fall prey to the trap of thinking just because someone is upset that you are responsible for their feelings. Sometimes that's the case, not here. You did nothing wrong, she's being extremely silly, and you should just chalk it up to her being immature and insecure.\n\nYou might be able to offer her some valuable advice about self improvement, building self esteem and not letting IG rule your life.

Somewhere there's a little boy who will spend his adult life saying \"This is your Valentine's Day present, honey...and this is your birthday present...\"", "We got married on my MILs bday (the only date the venue had available)and we asked her if that would be ok, not the other way around. lol.", "Love your ideas!", "I agree with everything you said except for not scheduling a wedding on someone\u2019s birthday as I think it\u2019s hard enough to secure a date at the venue you want at the time of year you want avoiding holidays or close friends/families due dates if they\u2019re pregnant etc. But if it\u2019s someone close I\u2019d definitely mention to them I\u2019m sorry it had to be on your birthday (or, is it ok it\u2019s your birthday if there is a choice of dates) but we want you there and would love to celebrate your birthday on the day. And I\u2019d do the birthday cake and happy birthday as you suggested. In no way is that sharing the spotlight, it\u2019s a wedding (once in a lifetime event (hopefully) vs a once a year event, it\u2019s just showing your friends how much you care about them and this bride is an entitled blank who does not care about OP.", "I am sorry, but if my 30th birthday happed to be on the day of any one of my friends, they would have acknowledged my birthday at the reception and sung happy birthday.", "Why would anyone but the couple themselves care about the first anniversary?", "Not to mention a lot of brides actually want a social media blackout for their wedding because they want to be the first one to pic and choose what gets posted from their wedding. So the \"rules\" are confusing", "I had friends get married the day before my birthday. We were still partying when midnight rolled around. These friends brought out a birthday cake and everyone sang Happy Birthday. I didn't expect it and was sappy crying that they planned ahead to celebrate my birthday at their wedding party.", "That's lovely.  Faith in the next generation  RESTORED"]}
