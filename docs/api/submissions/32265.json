{"id": 32265, "submission_id": "189w4hw", "title": "AITA for posting about my birthday and not my friend\u2019s wedding?", "selftext": "So my friend just got married.  We\u2019ve been friends for a few years now, we\u2019re not best friends but we\u2019re part of a larger friend group so we hang out a few times a month. \n\nShe had a HUGE wedding and a huge bridal party. I wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid (thank god) because she has a lot of high school and college friends, but I was invited to the bachelorette party. I declined, because it was bar hopping in Nashville and I no longer drink. Plus her wedding was a destination already (Caribbean) and I couldn\u2019t make both work financially. \n\nHer wedding happened to fall on the same day as my 30th birthday. I wasn\u2019t too bothered by this because I figured it\u2019d be cool to be in a tropical place for my birthday anyway, plus a lot of my friends were invited so I\u2019d get to celebrate with them anyway. \n\nWhen the bride realized she had booked it in my birthday last year, I remember she got kind of quiet and then said something like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I did that but I\u2019d appreciate if you celebrated the day before or after instead of on my wedding day.\u201d Again, didn\u2019t really have a problem with that. \n\nI don\u2019t use social media very much, I was playing the comparison game too much but this last year I really worked on myself and I\u2019m feeling more fit than ever before. I got a really nice dress for the wedding and I felt amazing in my skin for the first time. I decided to have one of my friends take some pictures of me on the beach at sunrise the morning of the wedding/birthday so I could have some good pics of me. I always hated taking photos because of low self esteem and I just was really feeling myself for the first time. \n\nA few of us who weren\u2019t in the wedding did a little birthday breakfast together on the beach. It wasn\u2019t a big thing, just five or six of us. My friends made me a little picnic. Got some great photos there too and I felt really happy. I decided to post the beach pics and the breakfast ones on IG. It was my first post in probably 2 years. \n\nThe wedding happened and then a few days later, I got some really angry texts from the bride. She said I broke my promise that I wouldn\u2019t celebrate on her wedding day, that I was trying to steal her thunder, and that I didn\u2019t even have the decency to post anything from her wedding when all our other friends did. She was on her honeymoon when she was texting me all this. \n\nShe said she had already been upset with me for not going to the bachelorette and basically called me a bad friend. I\u2019m really confused and hurt. It wasn\u2019t my intention to make her upset, I guess I did technically break my promise not to do anything on my birthday but I guess I just didn\u2019t think it was a big deal since it was just a breakfast. \n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR: my friend got married on my birthday, asked me to postpone any celebrations but my friends threw me a birthday picnic on the beach, I posted about it and now she\u2019s upset with me", "created_utc": 1701618202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189w4hw/aita_for_posting_about_my_birthday_and_not_my/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's TA for trying to get you to diminish your own birthday. Two different things can be celebrated on the same day. \n\nWhat you did was tame. I could see her being upset if you came to the ceremony in a birthday girl sash and crown upon your head but posting to your own IG about your own birthday is not breaking any promises nor did it impact her in any way.", "NTA\n\nHas it occurred to your friend that from now on her anniversary is going to be on your birthday?  Are you expected to *permanently* move your birthday to another day so as not to \"steal her thunder?\"  That's not even getting into expecting you to go bar-hopping when you don't drink and having a destination wedding you couldn't afford but still expecting you to put up pictures of it.", "You aren't a marketing contact, you're a friend. You were invited to the wedding as a guest, not a content creator. You have no obligation to post anything for anyone else. NTA. Live your life. Hope you got more likes than any wedding post.", "NTA - You're \"friend\" - who is not your friend - is a selfish little madam. She booked her wedding on your birthday which is neither here nor there because one has nothing to do with the other but then she had the nerve to demand you don't celebrate on your own birthday because she's a bride? Frankly, that's when you should have told her to take a long hike off a short pier however having a birthday breakfast on the beach is hardly partying it up. What kind of a spoilt, entitled brat thinks they can demand other people don't celebrate their own birthdays in whichever way they choose just because they happen to coincide with her wedding day? Some women really could do with a reality check on how little their big days actually matter to most other people. Oh yeah sure, attending a wedding is nice, but really, other than the wedding party for most other people it's a nice party where you get to dress up and have a good time with friends and family. It is not the most important thing in really anyone but the bride and groom's lives. And as for this throwing a tantrum because people can't make a bachelorette party. that's just silly.\n\nBut you have to feel a bit sorry for her really, if she's spending her honeymoon checking out all her friend's Instagrams - how else would she know - and firing off nasty texts if they haven't published enough adoration of her then it can't be much of a honeymoon.\n\nI'd simply ignore her, anyone who treats other people like this over something as ridiculously trivial as this is not someone you should invest any time or energy worrying about. You're not the bad friend here. She is.", "What a strange reaction. My good friends got married the day before my birthday and ended up coming out to celebrate my birthday the day after their wedding, which I in no way expected but of course very much appreciated. Now, years later, we exchange happy anniversary/birthday texts every year--we always remember each other's thing because of the proximity. If my wedding had been on a friend's birthday, I probably would have said happy birthday into a mic at some point during the reception. These things overlap sometimes. It's fine. Your friend is being weird. NTA.", " NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t make the picnic, your friends did.  All you did was quietly take a few pictures at sunrise and make a social media post.  Your friend doesn\u2019t sound like much of a friend.\n\nMy friend held her stag and doe on my birthday and they brought me balloons at the party.", "Another selfish bride who thinks the world revolves around them and their wedding. \n\nThere is no reason why people can't be happy for two special events in one day. \n\nIt is also selfish and self centered to plan several expensive events around a wedding and assume that their friends should face financial hardship to attend. \n\nThis bride isn't much of a true friend. NTA", "NTA. Your friend is extremely immature, unseasonable, and insecure to be so worked up over what you did. And that honeymoon must be going really well if she\u2019s picking a fight about what you posted on IG.", "NTA. I can't believe this bride is so insecure and petty she'd ruin her own honeymoon, wasting it by focusing on one guest who had another life event the same day. I'd find it hard to take her seriously, to be honest.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to go in a social media blackout just because she got married.", "NTA - she had a destination wedding and you weren\u2019t a bridesmaid, but you went and made the effort.

The bride didn't understand that not everything that happened in the world during her wedding day was about her wedding.", "Thing is, so many brides get upset about people posting pics of the wedding they took themselves. They want only the \"curated\" images selected by them that were taken professionally.\n\nI've seen more than one (OK, it was only two) brides having fits because they thought the photos posted by their friends and family didn't show them as they wanted to be seen. Candid photos will often have the bride talking, eating, hitching up her skirt or shoulder strap, or standing in a way that shows a tummy pooch. Their friends love them and are sharing happy moments, not trying to get on the cover of a bridal magazine.\n\nPretty sure whatever you did - posting pics of yourself and friends eating breakfast or of the bride later on - would have been wrong for this woman.\n\nRemind her you didn't intend to hurt her feelings and you went to a great deal of trouble and expense to be there for her. And you didn't mention your birthday at the reception where I have known of people hijacking it for their own birthday, engagement, or baby announcement.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Jesus H. Christ.  Your social media presence is yours, not hers.

That is what real friends do!  Fake friends think only about themselves and what everything to be about them every day!", "NTA. I find it hilarious when people decide to own a day and God forbid anyone stop them.\n\nMy cousin got married on my 13th birthday. Not a big birthday but a stepping stone one. The bride was cool with people telling me happy birthday. I was cool with going because I got some really good food and really good cake.\n\nThey\u2019re long divorced and I\u2019m now 40 and guess what? Everyone\u2019s world kept turning and we all still talk and get along. All because we both (even me as a kid) could figure out how to celebrate both events like a normal human.\n\nTell princess maybe for her next wedding, she can NOT schedule it on anyone in the groups birthday.", "NTA she didn\u2019t even know that you had a birthday breakfast until she saw the pictures so how on earth did it steal her thunder", "NTA. I feel sorry for the bride, supposedly on her honeymoon, yet scouring her guests' social media for affirmation; I'm guessing she's not getting it from the groom or the marriage.", "She could have moved the day of her wedding you can not move your birthday. I don't get how people think the world revolves around a wedding.", "Lord. What a ridiculous, pitiable existence for the bride.\n\nNTA. Don't fall prey to the trap of thinking just because someone is upset that you are responsible for their feelings. Sometimes that's the case, not here. You did nothing wrong, she's being extremely silly, and you should just chalk it up to her being immature and insecure.\n\nYou might be able to offer her some valuable advice about self improvement, building self esteem and not letting IG rule your life. Who knows if she'd be able to hear it. Maybe down the road.", "Imagine wasting your honeymoon on this.  NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
