Well, last night she was visiting with her bio dad when I got a text from my stepdaughter wondering if I could pick her up. Well, I got there she was sitting outside with her bio dad holding her arm she came over to my car and told me she was messing around with a skateboard and fell on her arm, her arm was bruised, swollen, and hard for her to move. I asked her bio dad why didn't he call my wife he said I don't think it's that bad she's just being dramatic. My stepdaughter just looked at me and said Dad can we just please go I'm in a lot of pain. As she was getting in the car I told her bio dad see this is why I'm her real dad, not you\u2026 I actually care for her and her well-being. \n\nLater that night my wife got an angry text from bio dad calling me an AH, and my wife kinda agrees that I was being an AH At that moment.  daughter actually did break her arm but her bio dad wasn't going to do anything about it\u2026 I'm the one who was in the ER with her until 1 am. \n\nAlso, I would like to add I don't call her my stepdaughter instead I call her my daughter just for the sake of the post I figured it would be easier.", "created_utc": 1702399201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gq48u/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughters_bio_dad_this_is/", "score": 920, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't have anything good or say or think about parents who don't take their kid's medical complaints seriously.  I had a friend in HS nearly die because his parents thought he was being overdramatic about his stomach pain.  He had to threaten to call 911 before they took him to the hospital.  Ruptured appendix - he has a very long scar and hospital stay since they had to flush everything and monitor him to make sure he wouldn't go septic.", "I may be biased here, because I too have a f\\*ckhead biodad, but NTA. Trust me, that kid will know to come to you when she needs help, not that asshole. And she will remember who sat with her til 1am and who called her dramatic. As someone who wishes they had a stepdad like you at some point in my life, good on you.", "I'll go NTA because I don't think what you did was a huge deal, but TBH I do feel the dig at him was unnecessary. \n\nThe point has been made - you are involved with her pretty much full time, she calls you dad, etc. and I really doubt anyone labors under any illusions that he is a good or involved father. Rather than chide him for using such poor and reckless judgment as to not treat an injury seriously, you kind of made it an attack on his character. As effectively a deadbeat dad it's hard to have much sympathy, but I understand your wife's perspective that you were being an AH in that moment.", "We all know who the real dad is.... the one that took her to the hospital.  And oops... you spoke your mind and stood up for your daughter", "NTA for all the reasons people have said, I just want to add that with broken bones where the skin is still intact, there\u2019s a very real possibility of something called compartment syndrome, where the swelling from the injury runs out of room to expand and it begins to cut off blood supply to the area. If this had happened and if your daughter had remained without medical care for too long, she could have lost her arm or worse. Her bio dad\u2019s behavior wasn\u2019t just mean for not taking her seriously, it was genuinely dangerous.\n\nEdit: the fact that her pain was actively getting WORSE makes me think that she actually might have been developing compartment syndrome (of course that\u2019s just a red flag symptom and it doesn\u2019t automatically make the diagnosis correct, but either way increasing pain generally indicates that some kind of ongoing tissue damage was happening) and it\u2019s lucky you got there in time \ud83d\ude2c", "Nta, good thing for stepping up, her bio dad is really a lousy person. Not taking his daughter to the emergency room after she broke her arm. You are absolutely right for what you said let him get mad, and then send him a bill for your time in the emergency room and said this should have been you not me if you really want to be a father.", "NTA. My son broke his arm when he was 11. My ex-husband picked him up from school, took him home and left him on the couch for 5 hrs. We lived 3 minutes from the hospital AND my son is a haemophiliac. \n\nI dont think your comment was out of line. Sometimes kids need to hear us calling out other adults for their stupidity.  Your daughter also received validation from you that she matters.", "Justified AH  because it's true. NTA though because it needed to be said and quite honestly go to the courts with this all documented and get his rights taken away he is an unfit parent", "NTA. Your child had to text you to pick them up because he arm was broken and the adult in charge did nothing to help her. You called him out for his bad behavior. If he doesn't like it, he can do better", "I mean- you didn't have to make that point. Your daughter- who is the important person- knows the difference between the person she chooses to call dad and the person she feels obligated to call dad.\n\nso NTA but I'm not sure why you felt the need to make the point.", "NTA. He failed so incredibly hard and was throwing out personal attacks while you dealt with the emergency. Far as I'm concerned he deserved a hell of a lot more that what was said.", "NTA.\nWell done dad!", "NTA Bio's blowing up his ex's phone over you calling him out, rather than checking on his daughter who *broke her arm* under his care and was in pain for *hours*? There's his priorities. Glad the kid has you OP.", "Oh ouch, I will have to go with NTA, but you should not have said that.  Just take the child to the ER and have her arm checked, then possibly later tell Bio Dad the arm was broken, and he should have taken her or at least told you sooner.  Saying that in the moment was because you saw your daughter in pain, and you were mad he thought she was exaggerating.  \n\nYou probably should apologize, but I don't think it makes you TA.", "ESH. Obviously the bio dad is a crap dad, but you're also TA for saying so in front of your child. \n\nBeing a petty jerk in front of your daughter is not the move. She already knows you are more reliable than her bio dad; that's why she called you. Your job as a stepfather is to love your kid (check), support her physically and emotionally (check), and not further complicate her relationship with her bio parent (nope). \n\nShit talking your kid's bio parent to your kid is only going to make her feel worse. She already has enough to worry about with a crap dad and a broken arm. Don't make her feel like she has to worry about managing your emotions too.", "Kind of ESH. I get the impulse, but you didn't add anything positive to the interaction here. Especially not cool to do where your kid could possibly hear. She doesn't need to be subjected to y'all's conflict or to be told her father doesn't care about her.", "Bio-dad is negligently abusive to the point she doesn't even call her mom she calls you, her Dad and somehow you're the asshole because you are justifiably angry your daughter isn't being cared for by the man who calls himself her father??? I mean make it make sense??? NTA", "NTA - she\u2019ll remember these moments growing up and realise who her REAL Dad is. Bio Dad needs a kick up the ass IMO", "NTA. He should have taken her to the ER himself. And your wife needs to support you not him.", "Let me get this straight... SHE BROKE HER ARM and he thought it was not that serious?!\nYeah NTA I'd have had some choice words with the guy as well. Even if it wasn't broken, it should still have been checked out regardless. He is at best careless and at worst neglectful. This is insane to me. Of course you're her real dad, when he's showing that kind of behaviour. \nI think some sharp words are the least he can expect for this situation tbh. He's probably calling you an asshole now, because he knows he's got no moral ground to stand on and thus he's attacking you. \n\nI'm glad you take better care of your daughter than her sperm donor.", "It was a petty thing to say in the moment, but sometimes petty is deserved.", "YTA - Not for fighting or saying something.  But for attacking his role in her life.  That was unnecessary.  You were mad - he was horribly wrong.  But you said something designed to inflame, not solve.  He is still her dad and she will still have to live there.  But now there is this fight thrown in his face as who the real dad is and who cares about her more.  You needed to state that he was out of line for not getting her checked out - and then reinforced it with the evidence of the broken arm.  But arguing over who the \"real\" dad is takes the issue from being about your daughter's safety to being about you.  You made this real issue into a personal measuring contest.  And this isn't about you.  Stop feeling threatened by this man and take care of your daughter.", "ESH - your daughter called you because she needed you to remove her from the situation, not escalate the situation.", "NTA you did the right thing.", "Unpopular opinion, but yes, YTA.\n\nWe get it, he\u2019s a deadbeat dad. She called you because she knew you\u2019d take her to the ER, because you are her dad. But that remark was unnecessary \u2014 even deadbeat dads know they suck, they don\u2019t need the \u201cknight-and-shining armor step-in\u201d dad to remind them. You picking her up already told him he sucks.\n\nSide note: And save me your downvotes. I\u2019m all for knight-and-shining armor step-in dads.", "I think ESH, because you said it in front of your stepdaughter. While likely you do feel more like a father figure to her, that\u2019s not your claim to make for her. She also does not need to witness any conflict between you two. It\u2019s only going to cause her unnecessary stress and confusion. If you have words to say to him, do it when she\u2019s not around. Or just let your wife deal with him. You\u2019re already the better parent/bigger man than him, so act like it. No need to start throwing insults around. Kids will always grow up to know who was there for them. \n\nHe sucks for obvious reasons. I hope your stepdaughter is doing okay now.", "YTA\n\nBecause it just wasn't needed at the time. You daughter was already dealing with him being a dick & not believing her & you added fuel to his fire. This will be all he talks about with her the next time he sees her. \n\nI don't disagree that you are right, just that it didn't need to be said, especially at that time.", "Soft YTA. What you said may have been true, but it didn't need saying. Especially in front of the girl.", "NTA while that was a bit too much, your daughter was seriously injured and should have been taken to the ER ASAP!", "I'm surprised its unpopular actually but definitely NTA. Childish? Maybe, but your SD was very clearly injured and in pain. Your wife should be pushing back on bio dad calling him an AH for not taking his daughter to the hospital when she needed it.", "ESH. Bio-dad is the bigger AH for just sucking as a person and a dad. You're an AH because you made a challenging situation harder for your wife and daughter, by creating more drama for them to deal with. I know it's hard to hold back your tongue in these situations but that's why you should. \n\nI recently read an essay by Lisa Edelstein (who played Cuddy on House) about becoming a stepmom, and one of the things she said was that she views a big part of her role as a stepparent as making sure that when it comes to the kids and her husband coparenting with his ex, that she does not give either of them anything additional to worry about. She's there to parent by invitation, but her primarily role is to make sure that when the kids are with them, her husband can just focus on being a dad. Her situation is a bit different from yours, but I thought this was a really good way of looking at. You're there to help, not to add to the drama.", "YTA - but I feel you here. I have 3 step kids. And their dad is a waste of space who always plays the victim.\n\nI can picture this same scenario in my head right now in my life. I have done more for those kids than their real dad ever would and they all know when shit hits the fan, they call me as I won't ever let them down.\n\nBUT - and a big BUT. You will lose this one as you bit. Sadly, as much as we want to shout out what we do and how we know we are the ones who will pick up the pieces, this action makes you the arsehole. God I am with you - so badly - but bio dads get a 'free pass' which forgives them for their absolute shambolic shiteness. We dont.\n\nYou have given bio dad some ammo against you now and coupled with his victim vibe - I have no doubt this will be used to besmerch your name. It doesnt matter anymore that he ignored his daughters broken arm, its now all about HIM and how YOU called him out.\n\nBe the bigger man mate. Its the horrible, almost bullshit, part of being the step dad.", "You gave him a lesson on fatherhood, that is needed to be taught long ago. He didn't take her to the hospital and waited for you to take him. He deserves all kinds of insults. But, you need some lesson too. Even though your daughter tells you she was in pain, you wasted time to insult him, which didn't work. Your daughter felt that pain for several seconds or a minute more.", "Gently, ESH. Undermining her bio dad in front of her wasn't necessary - your focus in that moment should have been your injured daughter, it wasn't helpful to pause for a cheap shot at the other guy. As your daughter grows up she won't need your help figuring out who's a deadbeat, but it'll make her childhood a lot easier if the adults around her can at least pretend to get along.", "YTA - (soft you're the asshole).  \n\n\nI have no doubt you provide better for this little girl than her biological father. And I have no doubt that you're a better parent to her.   \n\n\nBut you didn't really have to hit bio dad with \"this is why I'm her real father\". You could have just been the bigger person, gotten her the care she needed, and then let your wife tear into bio dad because yeah, clearly he wasn't going to handle that correctly.  \n\n\nI get the sense he was trying to \"hide the situation from his ex wife because he didn't want to deal with her.\" That would have been reason enough for her to light him up once she knew the full details of the situation.", "ESH\n\nBio dad should have called about the arm.\n\n\"I told her bio dad see this is why I'm her real dad, not you\u2026 I actually care for her and her well-being.\"\n\nBe careful, you're on a very high horse.  You'll get a nose bleed.", "YTA for saying that in front of your daughter. She is probably already having all kinds of thoughts that affect her self esteem about having this incompetent guy (assuming your assessment is accurate) as half her genetic makeup. For her sake, do not verbalize these thoughts in front of her.", "So I have to say soft YTA because you did the right thing but went and threw fuel onto the fire entirely unnecessarily. Obviously he failed to handle the situation properly and you handled it properly. No question to me who the better man/father here is. But sometimes they say that the best thing to say when you're right is nothing.", "ESH - An unnecessary comment aimed to do what? Make yourself feel superior? You already know that your the present/better parent. Why rub it in his face for no reason. My real bio dad did something similar to my sister btw. He didn\u2019t realize that she had broken her arm after a fall, so she didn\u2019t get taken to the hospital until my mom came home. A parenting miss for sure\u2026.but my dad loved and cared about us. He just made a mistake. Don\u2019t act so threatened.", "Justified YTA as far as what you said.\n\nIf a kid is in pain after the accident, sure. Ice it and see if it gets better. After an hour and the pain is the same, then I'm immobilizing it and we are in a medical facility ASAP. Unsure WTF your daughter's sperm donor was thinking. Even if it wasn't broken, you see the child is still in obvious pain after two+ hours, you take them to the ER or Urgent Care. Period. \n\nYou were simply expressing your opinion based on the current circumstances and conditions which in hindsight, was completely justified. \n\nYour daughter will only remember who was there with her at 1am when she got her cast so who cares what AH bio thinks or how he feels.", "You know you aren\u2019t the AH but it wasn\u2019t necessary to say that. I\u2019m sure you will get a lot of pats on the back for taking care of your daughter", "If done away from the child, fine. It was done in front of them. YTA.", "ESH\n\nYea, he\u2019s a bum and should have taken her straight to the ER\n\nBut don\u2019t say that shit in front of your kid.  Makes them feel like a object in a tug of war war", "It was immature to play the \u201creal\u201d dad card, and unnecessary to make that comment.", "ESH\n\nYes, he sucks, you clearly care more about your daughter than he does. \n\nAnd the actions you were taking already proved that. \n\nI\u2019m really not sure why you felt the need to throw that away with a cheap, petty insult in front of her.", "Soft YTA.\nI get the impulse, and you're obviously a decent guy.\nHowever\nHe's your daughter's bio dad and that means\nShe's going to have complicated feelings about him. Voicing how bad of a parent he is - is probably going to make her feel bad.\nIt's also going to make dealing with him - which you have to do, like it or not, even harder.\n\nSo, it just wasn't very smart. And you don't really gain anything from it.", "YTA for making that comment to him. He was completely wrong, but that phrasing was not necessary. You could have pointed out that there was a good chance the arm was broken, and he should not have dismissed her pain.  The fact that you turned out to be right is all the shame he needed.  He would have been that AH who couldn't be bothered to pay attention to his kid.  But that comment took away from his irresponsibility and made you look like a jerk. Now, the relationship between all of you is strained.  In the future, let him dig his own grave. There's no need for you to get buried with him.", "YTA. Your comment was unnecessary and rude. She hurt her arm on accident. Whether or not he would\u2019ve taken her to the hospital is irrelevant at this point because you did and she got the care she needed. If you want him to do more for her then snotty comments are not the way to go. You are hurting your daughter by being nasty towards her bio dad. Grow up.", "YTA\n\nYou're not the main character. It's not a competition. If you want to do good, then do good; if you want to do good and rub others noses in what you don't like (even with good reason), then be honest that that's what you're doing. Pick one.\n\nShe wasn't bleeding out. She didn't have a compound fracture. Bio dad didn't ignore actual medical advice. \n\nYou're *angry* that he didn't diagnose a swollen bruise correctly. That's worth frustration and disapproval, not highly personal insults. \n\nAgain, to be clear, YTA.", "YTA, you escalated a conflict, and it was absolutely not necessary.", "YTA - for saying the comment. As a girl, I also know we can be dramatic. I also know everyone has different tolerance for pain. \nWas her arm broken or a hairline fracture?", "Yeah ESH. I get the frustration absolutely but that was not the time to have that conversation. Your daughter tells you she\u2019s in pain and you\u2019d rather go off on bio Dad first. And in front of her no less. Hash this stuff out without her present. It\u2019s not necessary for her to be caught in the middle.", "ESH, him more than you. He\u2019s not being a good father, but that dig at him was totally unnecessary, especially in that moment. If he had objected to her calling you Dad and you responded with that, it would be more warranted. But in that moment, it\u2019s best to focus on your kid and not twist the knife on him.", "ESH. There was no point to arguing with him - it just puts your daughter in an impossible situation. Save it for the lawyer, when your daughter wants the visitation arrangements modified.", "YTA..... it was a petty thing to say and you said it out of jealousy.....", "Sorry YTA. Part of being the step parent is keeping the peace IMO. I get annoyed with the kids dad a lot. Telling him off for not getting her help immediately is fine but trying to one up him as her dad isn\u2019t. Sounds like you are the father figure, not him, so take the high road and be her dad. Starting drama isn\u2019t going to help anyone.", "Well, yeah you were being an asshole in that moment. YTA, but I would say it was justified.", "You're in a tough spot as a step parent.  You shouldn't have said what you did.  She will always claim you as her father,  but in the meantime,  it should be your wife who communicates with him.", "So in your eyes taking care of her means calling her mom?, both of you are assholes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s much more likely he takes it as a threat, and not a lessen.

Fuck that. The biodad is neglectful, and in the circumstances, OP was incredibly restrained.", "> I\u2019m really not sure why you felt the need to throw that away with a cheap, petty insult in front of her.\n\nBecause he's human.

He told me to walk it off. Turned out I got a blot clot trapped in my finger, and over the course of a couple days it swelled to the same size and shape as a concord grape. It also hurt like hell. My mom was on a business trip, and as soon as she got back, off to urgent care we went. They had to drill a hole into my finger to relieve the pressure, and I heard the doctor telling my mom that it was a good thing we came in then, because a couple more days and the tissues could have been permanently damaged or it could have gone gangrenous. We got home and she ripped him a new one. That finger never quite got all the feeling back, but I mostly don't notice.

She sat there for 2 hours with a broken arm and her \"bio dad\" did nothing? My son and I were playing on the couch, he fell backwards and hit his head, it was bleeding what seemed like a ton and I FREAKED out. I picked him up he was crying but conscious, we lived like a quarter mile from the hospital. I ran in there screaming that my son needed help, after they did a quick intake check on him they deemed it was basically just a cut and head wounds just bleed a lot. I was shaking man. I couldn't imagine a parent whose child was clearly seriously injured just saying \"walk it off\". I mean it sounds like your wife is kind of taking his side here, but I'd discuss seeing if you could officially adopt her.", "Ok fairness it can happen...

Yes.\n\nYeah, Y T A maybe, but I can understand not holding back in that situation.\n\nThe issue isn't that he didn't deserve it, the issue is he was 100% the AH, but you gave him ammo to deflect being an AH, make the issue about something else, and make your wife and daughter's life more miserable.", "She\u2019s miss placing her anger onto you - NTA", "Was it necessary to say? No. Was it true? Yes. \n\nI'd say NTA because it was an emotional situation for you seeing your daughter in pain, and you probably wanted to lash out at the person who left her in pain for so long.", "NTA.

Yes. \n\nWas my stepfather an emotionally abusive tyrant who didn\u2019t care to understand my feelings? Also yes. \n\nDid either of them put my best interest forward? Absolutely not. They were too wrapped up in making the other look bad under the guise they were trying to protect me. \n\nAt the end of the day, do they both love me in the ways they know how? Yes.
