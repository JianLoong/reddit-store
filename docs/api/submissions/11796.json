It\u2019s nothing insane and sounds \u201cnormal\u201d but I\u2019ve never met someone with the same name. Looking at that name analyzer there was 30 people named it last year. The point I\u2019m trying to make is, it\u2019s unique. People comment on it semi regularly. But it\u2019s made up, not a cultural or historical name. \n\nMy sister had a baby girl 2 years ago and named her the female version of my name. She didn\u2019t ask me if she could (I want to be clear I didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t expect her to, and I certainly would have approved if she did and I DO approve). I\u2019m totally fine with her having a similar name. \n\nI don\u2019t want to dox myself here, so for example let\u2019s say my name is THOR and my niece is THORA. It\u2019s off by a letter. \n\nI often babysit and have a good relationship with my sis and BIL. But when I\u2019m with niece and we tell people her name, OBVIOUSLY everyone immediately comments on our names being similar. I started jokingly saying oh yes she was named after me \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  \n\nMy BIL heard me say that to a neighbor while at the park with her and he blew up my phone after saying she wasn\u2019t named after me, why am I telling people that and I\u2019m delusional. \n\nI\u2019m kind of baffled at this aggression. I haven\u2019t responded or said anything to my sister as I\u2019m now wondering DID I overstep in saying that? I\u2019m awkward so I tend to stick to the same small talk script. No one ever did say she was named after me, and I certainly won\u2019t say that anymore. But was I out of line?\n\nEdit: I should also add that I am The Godfather and that was decided before she was even born or name picked out, so idk I kind of assumed she WAS named after me. Wouldn\u2019t most people? \n\nIdk though, I\u2019ve accepted I shouldn\u2019t have been saying that regardless.

BIL needs to go calm down.", "NTA. Here's my bad advice that you definitely shouldn't follow: Get a goldfish and name it the BIL's name with an additional letter. Talk about the goldfish a lot around the BIL, see if BIL thinks there's a connection between his name and the goldfish. Get unreasonably angry if the BIL suggests there's a connection.", "NTA. Why is there so much hostility towards you saying that? It's really strange to me.", "NTA. It's a harmless way of dealing with the frequent questions about how close your names are. Unless BIL named her after someone else I don't understand his overreaction.", "NTA. Your names are so similar that strangers comment on it, and you replied to the stranger jokingly. Even if you'd been serious, there's no need for BIL to get so aggressive about it. He could have just said she wasn't named after you, and that it was just a name they liked the sound of.", "NTA. I think BIL's reaction is disproportionate.\n\nYou should talk to your sister (not about the incident with BIL but to know whether your name was an inspiration for your niece's). I mean she is your sister and trusts you with her child so I think you can have a conversation about this.\n\nIt's possible (I'm making wild guesses here completely out of nowhere because why not) that maybe your sister did indeed name her daughter after you (or was influenced by your name or inspired or found it sounded great) and BIL disapproved and they had an argument and she won and now BIL is mad and doesn't want to acknowledge that.\n\nOr maybe not.", "NTA. \"I was just kidding around, brother. I'll stop doing it. I'm sorry it bothers you.\"", "That weird. My son is 100% named after my big sister. Why would a parent give a striking similar name to a baby as a close relative and say its not related?", "INFO: OP, this is so strange to me. Do your BIL/SIL like you? Like do y\u2019all have a good relationship?\n\nIt sounds like they might be frustrated that their daughters identity is subsumed by yours, but the joke you\u2019re making is sweet and relatively harmless. I\u2019m also not sure what they expected? If you name your daughter Jackie and your BIL is named Jack\u2026.. people are going to comment. The only context that could change my mind here is a contentious relationship.\n\nETA: Great relationship, no reason not to think these jokes would be cute and funny, NTA", "NTA. Your BIL\u2019s reaction seems a bit much to me.", "NTA\n\nI wonder though, if your sister told her husband, specifically,  that she was not naming the child after you, otherwise he might have disagreed with the name. Now, with you saying that, he is thinking that she might have lied to him about the origin of the name.", "NTA. Bizarre response from BIL. And honestly who really cares? They would think that regardless if you said anything or not.", "NTA - sounds like you just made an offhand comment and he overreacted. If it really bothered him that much, take the high road, apologize, and move on. \n\nAlso I WANNA KNOW THE NAME.", "NAH. The only thing I see here that could be construed as malicious thus making them the AH would be your ridiculous overreaction. It would have been easier and more reasonable if he had responded something like \"please don't tell people she is named after you it isn't true.\" and that's that he did not need to insult her or belittle her.", "NAH\n\nSimilar thing with my fam.  I have a unique name, I was not named after anyone, my moms coworker suggested the name & she liked it. \n\nHowever, my name is a mash up of the feminine version of my dad's name(sounds the same, spelled differently), and one of my auntie's names (again, same sounding name, but different spelling). SO, erroneously, my mom thought it woudn't really come up. Oh, how wrong she was. LOL\n\nMy parents honestly didn't think they would be asked a million times if I would have been a Jr if I was a boy, or if I was named after my aunt and dad, saying it was an \"interesting\" choice. \n\nSo, on any given day Mom might think it is funny/cute---or----if my mom was pissy with her sister, she would be mad/irritated if someone mentioned or if her one of her siblings(or even me, oops!) teased about naming her kid after favorite sister.  \n\nSo, while you aren't the AH for saying it, because to you is nbd.  You would be if you continued to do so. \n\nPersonally, I think it is funny ha ha, but right now it isn't funny for your BIL. Just apologize & tell them you won't do it again.  You love your niece & them, and while you didn't intend to be hurtful and careless, be sorry that you were.", "ESH, if you explicitly knew it was untrue then you shouldn\u2019t have said that, or should\u2019ve made it absolutely clear that it\u2019s a joke which people always assume. BIL shouldn\u2019t have blown up over such a small thing, if he knew you were joking. Even if he thought you weren\u2019t it\u2019s not that huge a thing to shout about. All that aside, if you have a fairly uncommon name then then cannot deny that your name had absolutely no influence on them while decided what to name their child. Also weird naming your child after someone you already know and then claiming that it did not affect their decision whatsoever.", "YTA, kind of. You're not \"implying\", you're \"saying\". That's a joke you might make just with immediate family. You could instead say \"We like to joke she's named after me\". Especially when it's people they'll see again. It may not be apparent to you at first thought, but there are a few reasons this could irritate parents. Or later on, the kid.", "YTA. If it's not true you shouldn't say it. There may be very real reasons for them naming their child that they don't want diminished. Also it could stir up family drama.\n\nDon't take credit for something that's not yours to take.", "YTA. \n\nLying is lying. Even if it's a fairly innocuous lie, you shouldn't lie about other people's kids.\n\n(And no. You didn't imply anything.  You flat out said it.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
