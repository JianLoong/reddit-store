The first thing you should\u2019ve done is get a new crate.  If your husband likes house training, let him do it, or at least invest in some classes.  If you\u2019re really not up for this, then find him a home with someone who is able to look after him, or find a no-kill shelter outside your city.", "YTA if your solution is dropping that dog off where you found him.  That\u2019s cruel and exactly why there are issues with strays. \n\nThere is no way the dog is happier on the streets. That\u2019s just what he knew and was used to. It\u2019s been a couple weeks.   That\u2019s not a lot of time to settle in.  It can take months for a rescued dog to adjust.  I\u2019ve been through it, including some carpet and blinds destruction.  With some intentional redirection and focused training, we got past that destructive anxiety.  (For us, it helped up just give the dog free rein of the house so he could look out the window oddly enough). Everything you described can be improved with some training.  It\u2019s just going to take time.  \n\nNow that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be you.  There could be rescues that can help you rehome him with a foster situation. Maybe you know someone who could give him the time.   To drop him off where you found him could break his spirit.   \n\nDon\u2019t give up on Koda by leaving him."]}
