Our mom passed away recently from an aggressive form of cancer that we didn't know she had and so had no time to treat before she died. My dad has been living in a different state for work and has been since the beginning of Covid. it was his choice to leave as there were still jobs in our area when he left. Anyway so he's been gone for a few years and his relationship with my mom had been strained to say the least and they were both considering divorce. Obviously he came home to be with her in the hospital while she passed and stayed host the service but he left after that to go back to work. I'm not entirely sure why he thinks anything has really changed but suddenly he's obsessed with being a present father and wants to move us all to him. That would mean leaving our friends, support groups, activities, and our mother's home. Not to mention any pets we'd have to part with for the move. My brother is autistic and needs stability in his life right now. He is used to my dad not being around and is fine without him, I've had a bad relationship with him since I was young so I certainly don't need this, and my sister has already said that if he moves us she's staying here since she's old enough to live independently and already has a good job. Needless to say that this move would benefit only himself and he is not considering the needs of anyone other than himself. If I had the option to I would stay with my sister but my brother is so yound and my dad doesn't know how to handle taking care of him so I know I can't abandon him but I wish more than anything I could just stay. Our dad hasn't wanted to be here for years and it was his choice to leave in the first place, but now that he's sad and a bit lonely he suddenly wants us all to be together and it's not fair. Not to mention he could still just move back here if he really wanted to. But he wants to disrupt everyone else's lives to meet his own needs. I just want to tell him to grow up and bare it like he should, it wasn't his fault that she died but it was his fault that he's not been around so he needs to take responsibility for his choice and either come back here or just leave us alone aside from sending money.

That alone must be awful for him. His relationship with the three of you has also suffered in that time, has he not been coming back much to visit?\n\nAs for local jobs, there's any number of reasons they wouldn't have been suitable, be they differing skills, less pay etc. I'm also assuming there's a good chance that you and your siblings weren't given all the facts about the move. Could be he worked out of state due to relationship issues he and your mom already had, in an attempt to relax things. You won't know unless he talks about it really.\n\n>he's been gone for a few years and his relationship with my mom had been strained to say the least and they were both considering divorce.

That would mean leaving our friends, support groups, activities, and our mother's home. Not to mention any pets we'd have to part with for the move\n\n>this move would benefit only himself and he is not considering the needs of anyone other than himself\n\nHim being gone for so long hasn't had any positive effect on how the rest of you view him, because he's been an absentee parent. His intentions aside, he's been emotionally distant or gone for 3 years, that's going to leave a mark. That means your younger brother was 8, and is now 11. No wonder your dad wouldn't know how to care for him, kids with autism require more attention and somewhat different care to neurotypical kids. That'll depend on his individual circumstances, but your dad should've made an effort to be somewhat present for him.\n\nWhen someone close to you dies, it can affect your outlook a lot. I've known people change jobs, uproot and move, completely adjust their lives just after losing someone, be they a parent, partner, child etc. Sounds like this may have put into perspective how lonely he is, and how he needs people round him.\n\nNTA\n\nYou and your siblings needed your dad. Past tense. Financially he's been there, but your mom just died and he's gone out of state for work. He needs to prioritise what's important, and sometimes that means making changes. Expecting all 3 of you to uproot your lives to move to his state is selfish, and wouldn't be best for you.\n\nHe needs some emotional support, but is going about it the wrong way. It's easier emotionally for him to bring you to him than to be vulnerable with you.\n\nI nearly voted N A H because you're all in mourning, and grief does awful things to people. But the fact that he's happy to let two of his kids parent the 11 year old while you're allourbinh the loss of your mom is what settled it for me. Rest assured, aside from badly dealing with grief, he's absolutely the asshole. You and your sister are doing what's right for you and your brother.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, and I hope he sees some sense.", "NTA - Damn OP. I'm really sorry.  That has to be incredibly tough.  Maybe the dramatic and traumatic situation has prompted your dad to want to \"do the right thing\" and be a better father.  But that doesn't dismiss, nor change the fact that the has been a negligent dad in the past. Is there anyway your older sister can officially become the legal guardian for you and your brother?  \n\nRegarding your specific question: I don't know if \"grow up\" would be the right thing. I would try to approach from a very matter of fact perspective:\n\n1. You have abandoned us over the last few years. \n\n2. That has caused us a lot of pain\n\n3. We aren't interested in moving your town.\n\n4. You can move back here, or you can leave us alone but we aren't interested in moving anywhere else.", "[deleted]", "You *MIGHT* (emphasis on \u201cmight\u201d) be the AH for telling him to \u201cget over it\u201d but you *are NOT* the AH for feeling the way you feel\n\nIn fact, if you were to get mad at him at all, it\u2019s entirely justified.

People get defensive when you yell at them. You and your sister might be close to adults but that doesn\u2019t mean you are ready to take care of an 11 yr old full time. What if one of you get a job offer far away? Or break a leg? \n\nTalk to your dad and lay out your needs, for yourself and your siblings.  Say there are too many good reasons to stay in place.

I\u2019m sorry for your mom, and I\u2019m sorry you feel abandoned by your dad. I personally have had a difficult relationship with my own dad and I can imagine how you feel.

What he is doing seems incredibly selfish to me but i dont know what legal implications there might be.", "Sounds like his loneliness is not new. I don't get the impression that he and the mom's relationship was as black-and-white as stated so maybe they both lived with the hope that one day, a change will come where it all worked out. But now his sadness shows that he lost his wife and his kids are \"used\" to not being with him. I won't say yay or nay to being the A but your last statement about money shows that he needed to keep work for his family. I want to be with my family and provide for them. I hope to never have to choose between the two.", "NTA, I\u2019m so so sorry about your mom.\nI understand how difficult it is for y\u2019all to warm up to your dad especially after being absent for a long time. but YWBTA if you don\u2019t move in with your dad. Your sister might not be able to cater for y\u2019all\u2019s needs if you stay back. I know taking that step will hurt a lot and you\u2019ll leave lots of amazing memories behind but you gotta do it for your brother. He needs all the care and attention he can get.

You can say there are jobs where you live but it's about jobs that he gets offered and can work- so a place can have jobs but if he was struggling to get one, it doesn't matter. But the real issue here is that it's not fair to your 20 year old sister to give up her life to take you and your brother on. She's young and deserves to have her own life not to become your pseudo-mom in the absence of your birth mom. You honestly don't have any leg to stand on when it comes to the 11 year old- he can easily get custody of him. Your sister would have to contest it in court. In regards to you, you will be 18 soon and can leave then. But yeah, be prepared for at least your brother to be moving soon.", "YWBTA\n\nAre you sure he wants this move because he is suddenly lonely? I mean, he's been living alone for a while now. Perhaps he wants it because he wants to make sure you are all okay?\n\nTalk to him as calmly as you can. You're all grieving so it won't be easy but it's the best way to get what you need.
