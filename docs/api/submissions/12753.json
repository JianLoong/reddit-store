Our mom passed away recently from an aggressive form of cancer that we didn't know she had and so had no time to treat before she died. My dad has been living in a different state for work and has been since the beginning of Covid. it was his choice to leave as there were still jobs in our area when he left. Anyway so he's been gone for a few years and his relationship with my mom had been strained to say the least and they were both considering divorce. Obviously he came home to be with her in the hospital while she passed and stayed host the service but he left after that to go back to work. I'm not entirely sure why he thinks anything has really changed but suddenly he's obsessed with being a present father and wants to move us all to him. That would mean leaving our friends, support groups, activities, and our mother's home. Not to mention any pets we'd have to part with for the move. My brother is autistic and needs stability in his life right now. He is used to my dad not being around and is fine without him, I've had a bad relationship with him since I was young so I certainly don't need this, and my sister has already said that if he moves us she's staying here since she's old enough to live independently and already has a good job. Needless to say that this move would benefit only himself and he is not considering the needs of anyone other than himself. If I had the option to I would stay with my sister but my brother is so yound and my dad doesn't know how to handle taking care of him so I know I can't abandon him but I wish more than anything I could just stay. Our dad hasn't wanted to be here for years and it was his choice to leave in the first place, but now that he's sad and a bit lonely he suddenly wants us all to be together and it's not fair. Not to mention he could still just move back here if he really wanted to. But he wants to disrupt everyone else's lives to meet his own needs. I just want to tell him to grow up and bare it like he should, it wasn't his fault that she died but it was his fault that he's not been around so he needs to take responsibility for his choice and either come back here or just leave us alone aside from sending money. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: to clarify a few things, \n\n#1 I have not talked to him yet and I don't intend on actually saying those harsh things. I know he's hurting and I'm not going to be mean. I made this post after he told me he wants to move us and I was overwhelmed and emotional but I'm not a monster \n\n#2 For those saying that I don't know why he left in the first place, or that I don't know that he could come home, I do know that he could come back as there are jobs available currently and our house payment currently is less than rent in most places. To the fact of him leaving to begin with there was no conversation to be had. I watched him pack up and leave without a word of conversation to our mom or anyone else.\n\n#3 both of my parents were very open about their relationship. I would get calls from them both describing in detail all issues they were having with each other so please don't say that I didn't know what was going on with their marriage because I knew exactly what was going on.\n\n4# he doesn't have two house payments right now, he doesn't have a house where he lives right now.

That alone must be awful for him. His relationship with the three of you has also suffered in that time, has he not been coming back much to visit?\n\nAs for local jobs, there's any number of reasons they wouldn't have been suitable, be they differing skills, less pay etc. I'm also assuming there's a good chance that you and your siblings weren't given all the facts about the move. Could be he worked out of state due to relationship issues he and your mom already had, in an attempt to relax things. You won't know unless he talks about it really.\n\n>he's been gone for a few years and his relationship with my mom had been strained to say the least and they were both considering divorce.

His intentions aside, he's been emotionally distant or gone for 3 years, that's going to leave a mark. That means your younger brother was 8, and is now 11. No wonder your dad wouldn't know how to care for him, kids with autism require more attention and somewhat different care to neurotypical kids. That'll depend on his individual circumstances, but your dad should've made an effort to be somewhat present for him.\n\nWhen someone close to you dies, it can affect your outlook a lot. I've known people change jobs, uproot and move, completely adjust their lives just after losing someone, be they a parent, partner, child etc. Sounds like this may have put into perspective how lonely he is, and how he needs people round him.\n\nNTA\n\nYou and your siblings needed your dad. Past tense. Financially he's been there, but your mom just died and he's gone out of state for work. He needs to prioritise what's important, and sometimes that means making changes. Expecting all 3 of you to uproot your lives to move to his state is selfish, and wouldn't be best for you.\n\nHe needs some emotional support, but is going about it the wrong way. It's easier emotionally for him to bring you to him than to be vulnerable with you.\n\nI nearly voted N A H because you're all in mourning, and grief does awful things to people. But the fact that he's happy to let two of his kids parent the 11 year old while you're allourbinh the loss of your mom is what settled it for me. Rest assured, aside from badly dealing with grief, he's absolutely the asshole. You and your sister are doing what's right for you and your brother.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, and I hope he sees some sense.", "NTA - Damn OP. I'm really sorry.

She's young and deserves to have her own life not to become your pseudo-mom in the absence of your birth mom.

I just can't see someone who would move away from his family (and spend extra money on separate rent/utilities/costs) unless there was a bigger benefit to it. He probably feels extra guilty about it given how fast everything went down, and he's worried that something might happen to you guys without him around.

As they would have been remanded into government care, or transported to the father upon the death of their mother had they determined the older sister to be an unfit interim guardian.

Most courts use the BIC or best interest of the child. It's a list of factors:  what had the child's routine been, whose been the primary caregiver and once a child hits a specific age...WHAT THE CHILD WANTS is definitely on the list and  considered ( mainly.because older children tend to run away if you force them places and courts DONT want to.criminalize kids).  In WV its wv code 48-9-101 if you want the full list. Plus sis could argue and would be considered, what the courts call, a psychological  parent. Not a bioparent but someone who has been taking on parenting responsibilities  and the child sees as a parent. That's in wv code 48-9-103. IDK what state OP lives in but Most states have similar.  So given these facts: dads been gone for years. They've lived there with mom, when mom got sick they still lived there WITH SISTER with no issues, dad didn't come back til mom was in hospice and again LEFT THEM THERE with sister.

You really don't know anything about what you're talking about..... \n\nWhen considering residence placement of minor children, status quo is actually the main factor for consideration in primary residence. Also in order for the older sister to currently have care of the children, that means that legally she is acting as a kinship care person for her siblings. Which means that their living situation would have been reviewed, and approved upon their mothers death, and that means as far as legal standing goes, CPS has reviewed, and approved their current living situation. Otherwise they would have already been remanded into government custody, or transported to the father.\n\nThe fact that the father has been a primarily absent figure, while the sister with current parenting over the younger siblings has been the consistent parental figure in their lives, not to mention the fact that the younger brother is on the spectrum, and requires specialized accommodations, and care which the father is unfamiliar with, it is actually extremely likely that a judge would rule in favour of allowing them to maintain their current living situation out of best interests of the child. \n\nThese are all factors that judges don't just consider, but use as the primary basis of their rulings in family court proceedings.", "Yep.
