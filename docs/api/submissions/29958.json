Him asking for it back is just another power play where he can confront  you again.  It's over, it's done.  Cut contact.", "NTA. Had an ex try that shit with me too. It was a long distance relationship and he wanted me to ship back to him the gifts that he got me while we dated. I told him to go fuck himself. lmao", "NTA- he wants excuses to talk to you. You just have to block him", "NTA but why on earth are you still talking to him!? It\u2019s way too obvious what he\u2019s doing and trying for you to not notice. Go NC like yesterday. Asking back for used underwear is also just fkg gross. Tell him he\u2019s being disgusting and block him everywhere.", "Even if you give it back, rip em to shreds first. If he doesn't trust you not to wear them, I wouldn't trust him not to want them back for creepo reasons. NTA", "NTA.  I would cut it up in small pieces, take a picture of it, and send it to him with a message that there is no way you can wear it for someone else.  Then I would block him.  I personally would be really uncomfortable giving him back lingerie that I had worn.  It's kind of creepy that he would even ask for it.", "NTA. It would be weird if you gave him back used lingeries. At worst, toss them if they remind you of him.", "This sounds like it might be leading somewhere dangerous. He doesn't care about the lingerie, he just can't let go and that's his excuse to keep engaging with you. If you've said everything you have to say, then that's it. You don't owe him anything and don't let him or anyone else convince you otherwise.  Be careful.\n\nNTA", "Cut it up and send him a pic", "And block him on everything", "Exactly and sounds like she needs a restraining order.", "Maybe he wants it back so he can keep it.", "> He doesn't own you.\n\nOr the lingerie!", "Or he\u2019s cheap and wants to give used lingerie to the next woman. Ewwwww!!\n\n\nNTA", ">He\u2019s bitter about 12 bucks he spent on cheap underwear. Pathetic\n\nSeriously, on top of everything else...*Shein*?! \n\nNot like he spent his month's wage on La Perla or something. \n\nInsult to injury.", "I was also surprised. Like, if you gift your girlfriend something, at least something that isn't bad for your health.", ">Get a male friend to wear it, take a polaroid and leave it in the bag and return it to him. NTA.\n\nThis sounds humorous but this guy sounds unhinged. He'd conclude she is confirming she slept with another guy and that's him in the lingerie. Might endanger the guy too.\n\nAnything she does in reaction? Will be this guy winning. Like a marionette he yanks her strings. Total no contact is the goal.", "Also pour glue / petrol or something all over them.   \n\n\nblock him, give them to a friend to give back to him.", "This, but set the shit on fire. \n\nActually, it\u2019s probably safer to turn off your read receipts and tell him you\u2019re not going to respond anymore and then don\u2019t respond any more. Every time he contacts you it\u2019s just to stay in your life in some fashion and force you to listen to him. He\u2019s going to do that as long as it works, or until he finds a new focus. Be boring, never respond again. \n\nYou can outright block him, but he\u2019s already calling from unlisted numbers so that might not be super-effective and also it may be helpful to have documentation or warning if he starts to be threatening.", "Haha, I just said the same thing. I definitely wouldnt be meeting up with this guy to give him some cheap underwear back.", "Yes.", "The Shein part made me laugh so much! I was thinking it was like Agent Provocateur or something that he was trying to get his money back. 100% it's just a ploy to keep harassing her because who in their right mind wants to take back some $5 used underwear they gifted someone?", "I wouldn't advise to give him back because I bet he's just using it as a ploy to meet her alone", "He's trying to find reasons to contact her. She should not bend to his demands. It's a gift and hers to do whatever she pleases.", "Do not give him anything. It's not about the underwear, it's about trying to stay in contact. If he sees it works, he'll keep finding other things she needs to return. This is the dynamic at the moment and it is extremely unhealthy.\n\nIf fact: if he really was a pervert who cared only about the underwear and giving it to him would make him leave OP alone forever, I'd recommend to do just that.", ">he asked to talk THEN **asked for the lingerie back because he bought it so i\u2019d wear it for him only**. i responded ill throw them away and he responded \u201c **why tf have you not thrown them away already lmfao you already used em huh**\u201d which feels kind of weird to say. then **he said he doesn\u2019t trust that i\u2019ll throw it away because his ex was always lying**. i told him im not comfortable with that and ill throw it away, **he just said he doesn\u2019t trust me not to wear it and told me to meet him outside of class and give it back to him**.\n\nHe said those things...So he even admits he wants it back so she can't wear it for anyone else.\n\nHe's even using it as a ploy to meet her alone somewhere.", "Yes, he is cheap. Lingerie from Shein...big spender!", "It could be a cheap thing or worse maybe he wants his new GF to look like old one.  Instead of asking his new GF to look like a sexy nurse for cosplay he wants her to like his X.  New level of creepy.", ">he\u2019s already calling from unlisted numbers\n\nOP might want to find the leak there.\n\nIs he getting it from a friend or relative under some excuse? She might want to warn them.\n\nBut these days people can stalk using so many means. Unlisted should mean unlisted, however.", "To jack off with it as a trophy.", "Its not that I think. Its reminds me of playground dynamics, as in, you give your toy to someone and then you have a fall out so out of spite, you dont want them to be happy woth the toy you gave them because you two arent friends any longer. Its bitterness/spite/ not wanting to be the reason she has something she likes.", "Yeah the dude doesn't care about the lingerie he is just obsessed and this is the most recent thing he has(in his head) an excuse to contact, harrass, and try to gain further contact with OP.\n\nTHIS IS HOW YOU END UP BEING HELD BY YOUR HAIR IN A STAIRWELL WITH YOUR EX REFUSING TO LET YOU LEAVE.", "And by keeping the gift, that\u2019s the excuse he has to contact her.  If it means nothing to her, give it back and take away the excuse he has to contact/see her.", "Contact, possession, power, control.", "Yeah he's trying to force her to maintain a dialogue with him. She needs to block him and stop responding to his stupid demands. Every response is a cave-in to what he actually wants: her time and attention.", "She could just Venmo him $10 and then they\u2019d be square.", "Hmm, I assumed she meant he was doing whatever it is that you can do to not have your number shown to the person you\u2019re calling so that it appears as \u201cunknown number\u201d rather than that he was really calling from an official unlisted number/someone else\u2019s phone.", "\ud83e\udd22", "I feel like it could be both things."]}
