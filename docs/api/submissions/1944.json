I think church and 6pm curfew are a bit intense for my house my rules, you did nothing wrong by saying \"I don't like your rules, I won't stay at your house\"", "NTA. When it comes to guests, \"My, house, my rules\" falls under things like, \"no shoes in the house,\" \"no food in the living room,\" or \"no swearing.\" If it was a vegan or Jewish home even \"no meat or pork in the house.\" \n\nDemanding an adult participate in an activity that doesn't align with their personal beliefs or setting unreasonable demands on their schedule is someone trying to force their lifestyle in you.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA - She sounds like a loon with rules for grown people and 6pm curfews. Protect your peace. People like that should not have guests.", "If she ever stays with you, make her take part in a Black Mass. \"My house my rules, and in this house we worship the Dark Lord Beelzebub...\"", "NTA, and \u201cmy house my rules\u201d are about things like what food comes in, where to put wet towels, and if you can smoke.  Trying to control people by making them go to church?  Only AHs do that.", "NTA. I understand rules about no phones at the table. No tv so the family can eat together. No loud music or tv when people are sleeping. But making someone go to church and have a curfew is crazy. A curfew I get so you don\u2019t disturb people coming in at night but 6 is just crazy.", "NTA it seems like your cousin is trying to use her position as a way to manipulate you. \"My house my rules\" is more for things like taking off your shoes at the door or leaving their favorite ice cream alone. However your cousin is just as free to not allow you to stay if you don't want to go to church as you are free to not stay there if you don't want to go to church.", "NTA. Your cousin is funny! She's upset that she can't oppress you anymore?! Haha", "NTA. Her house, her rules (which are admittedly unreasonable). If you don\u2019t like the rules you are not required to stay at the house. There are so many posts which are the opposite - the poster feels bad for kicking someone out who won\u2019t follow reasonable rules. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad for not putting yourself in a difficult situation.", "NTA - good lord", "NTA. at all. people who do that to their guests are literally crazy. who is anyone to push religion onto people?", "NTA. If she\u2019s going to insist on her house, her rules, you can absolutely opt out. Perfectly handled.", " No!  Your cousin is the AH!\n\nNo one, not even your host, has any right to force their religious beliefs down your throat.", "Nta. There\u2019s no way anyone is forcing me to go to church", "NTA you were right. You don\u2019t have to follow her rules and it was your choice to leave. Thanks but no thanks.", "NTA.

That way you could either plan to go to service of your choosing or go to hotel. Getting dragged out of bed for that news is bad.\n\n6 pm bedtime is bad. If they go to sleep they could request guests to be quiet. Lecturing them to fall asleep at the same time is controlling.", "^ this.\n\n NTA", "Exactly.
