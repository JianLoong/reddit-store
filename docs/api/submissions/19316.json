However, I might suggest that you consider a compromise to be vacationing with them every couple years. Your kids will appreciate the time spent with their grandparents and uncle. So, maybe you go somewhere else this year but, go with them next year or the year after when your child is older and the drive doesn't seem as daunting. We have done long drives with our kid (+ dogs) and sometimes its miserable but, we always appreciate and enjoy the family time since we live so far from our families.", "NTA, your life, your choice.", "Info - how much notice did you give them and does that impact their plans?

I would forgive them for being upset unless they are being excessive about it. Empty nest stuff, your parents may still be getting used to the fact that you're grown and are doing your own thing. They probably want to see the baby, and change sucks when it's something that used to be fun like family trips, but you know, you age out. \n\nMaybe next year you get a sitter and go. Just an idea! As someone with a dead parent and the other too frail to go, while yes, you have a fresh family rolling, try and keep the existing in mind. Just because you never know when life might come at you fast and then you can't anymore. Compromise means maybe it evolves and you do the trip planning yourself. Could be a family BBQ instead for a minute. Maybe a day trip. Maybe you do some serious pre-planning and do an adult style vacation like a cruise.", "NAH.

And yeah, they are absolutely entitled to not go if they don't want to. I never suggested they had to go. I just pointed out that I didn't know (and you don't know either) why they have to cancel one for the other.

Is your little one sensitive to pressure changes and travel and such?", "Wanting to create your own traditions as a family is OK.  Your mother just needs to understand that now that you have a family, things are naturally going to be different.  You were up front with them several months ago.  She is just choosing to keep bringing it up.  I totally understand not wanting to travel that far with an infant.  Your mother needs to understand that.

We would also like our first family vacation to be with just us, and not the grandparents.", "You certainly have that right. I agree with Professional Ruin on the basis of trying to tailor responses towards *not* opening negotiation.

She made it most of an hour before calling and saying we had to meet somewhere, because he wouldn't stop crying.

After that incident they stopped suggesting family outings that required driving more than an hour.", "Tons of them. I lived in Europe for a bit and traveled all over by car, going from one country to another. It's quite common. Also, Canada. Also, Central and South America. Also Australia. Honestly, you thought people only drive 10 hours in the US? How ridiculous.  \n\n\nAnd I never suggested everyone's life experiences should be exactly like mine.
