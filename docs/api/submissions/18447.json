Ultimately we've been good. No drama or problems. I will say Ericka's family dynamic is ultimately different compared to mine and my friend's. He told me Ericka's family was full of toxic beliefs growing up that she could shake off but her brother couldn't. Now from what I've gathered all of Ericka's family is either dead or she doesn't know where they are, but said brother.\n\nMy friend explained the relationship between his girlfriend and her brother is weird at times. They are very close, which she explained to my friend was due to issues in childhood and PTSD they both carry now due to circumstances. And when I mean close I mean call each other everyday and say they're each other's best friend. Ericka's brother is also very sexist. Ericka explained growing up their parent's views were full of toxic, inaccurate messages about gender and gender roles. Well Ericka is trying to help her brother work through these perspectives, but the cherry here is she's too afraid to tell her brother she's dating my friend and has been for a year now. Neither of them have met yet and her brother doesn't even know my friend exist. \n\nI asked my friend how he felt about that, as he knew my family quickly after we started dating. he told me Ericka's just worry to lose the only family member she has left and doesn't want to give up on him, but hopes as she continues to work with her therapist to hopefully chose on the best course of action if her brother doesn't change. I wasn't as forgiving and started to ask if he worries about other secrets she keeps, if he's really with being a secret, if he felt disrespected? He stopped talking to me, then later told me we could only talk if we're discussing any other topic.
