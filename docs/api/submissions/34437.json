{"id": 34437, "submission_id": "18zmis9", "title": "AITA suing my ex for not paying rent", "selftext": "So a couple of month ago my girlfriend of 4 1/2 years broke up with me. She gave reasons, mainly that she didn\u2019t have the energy to be in a relationship with me anymore. I did not want to break up and am pretty shook about the whole thing as this is my first real love, long-term relationship, and breakup. It was the 2 of us and my best friend all sharing a house. When she broke up with me she made it clear she wanted to exit the lease and was going to stay with her mom who lives about an hour away. She gave me these options:\n\nThe first and best option was to sublet the lease and have someone sign in her place. We actually did have someone who wanted to do that which would\u2019ve worked out perfectly for everyone. However the landlord made it clear that was impossible without signing a new lease entirely and we don\u2019t consider that an option.\n\nThe second option is for me and my friend to sign her out of the lease. She would pay a $500 fee and then we would be stuck paying her rent for the duration of the lease (5 month)  Me and my friend said this isn\u2019t a good option for us since we can\u2019t afford to pay all of that plus utilities.\n\nThe third option is that a $5000 termination fee is paid and the lease is ended early. This would leave all of us living with our parents again for a couple months. Me and my roommate didn\u2019t want to do this. We told her she would have to pay the entire $5000 and we wouldn\u2019t split it 3 ways. She says she cannot afford that and we are obligated to split it since we are all on the lease.\n\nAfter talking to my friends dad who is an attorney he made it clear those were not our only options. He said unless she pays the entire termination fee, we could just do nothing and keep the lease going. This was a good option for me and my friend, but bad for my Ex. She would have to drive an hour to work and back and pay rent for a place she wasn\u2019t staying. This would also prevent her from getting her own place until the lease was over. When we told her this was the option we are choosing she quickly took all her things out of the house and completely ghosted both me and my roommate.\n\nSo pretty much a month goes by and she doesn\u2019t pay her portion of the rent. We spoke to the landlord who said she was not answering any attempts at contact. I even texted her daaaaad. My friends dad says we are able to sue her for her portion of rent. So we did and are currently waiting to have the papers processed and served. It won\u2019t cost us any money in the long term since my roommates dad will represent us for free. However this seems to be completely screwing her over and it feels petty taking legal action against my ex-girlfriend of almost 5 years. This would also potentially mess up her renters history. Is it too far suing her or is this a reasonable response?", "created_utc": 1704501164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zmis9/aita_suing_my_ex_for_not_paying_rent/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When she gets served her summons for court maybe she will try to mitigate. However you may find it hard to collect if she isn\u2019t working because you will need to garnish her wage.

It is absolutely not fair to be paying rent on a home you\u2019re not living in. I\u2019m on her side in that aspect. I also get that you\u2019re pissed she ghosted which is not cool.

You\u2019re legally right, but yes, she\u2019s getting fucked over, and I\u2019d be willing to bet she will fuck you right back. There\u2019s really no winning in this situation because you truly don\u2019t have a good option. But don\u2019t expect her to just cough up the cash without putting up a fight. She may very well make your life hell until you find a 5th option. If I were her I would move right back in, because you have really left her with no other choice. Who will that be worse for? You or her? She will call your bluff. I\u2019d recommend you try harder find an amicable solution, even if it\u2019s just for your own sake. Court is a nuclear option and it is going to blow up in your face. \n\nEdit: actually ESH is too harsh, I think it\u2019s a tie for me between ESH and NTA, because while I think you are being very unwise and probably a little spiteful, you don\u2019t have a lot of good choices that\u2019s for sure.

If you've been good tenants, the landlord is extremely unlikely to refuse no matter what reservations were expressed at the start.

A good landlord would probably have been willing to re-sign for 6 or 9 months if you had asked nicely.", "If you were willing to terminate the lease if your ex paid the $5000 fee, why would it be an issue to you if the landlord didn't accept your new application?

Shes an adult, the consequences that come with terminating a lease early are entirely on her. How you and your roommate decide to cope with that is valid.", "They basically forced the ex into the worst option for her. She moved out but still had to pay rent which is wrong, and then OP has the audacity to go and sue her?", "What is her monthly share of the rent and how many months before the lease is up?

While they are both bad options... she had them.", "I respect that.", "Agree.\n\nu/bigcharliebrownmoney, you are focused on her 'option' refusals. The main issue is she did not create a solution and her leaving does not  erase the 5K financial obligation.\n\nShe refused to create solutions such as securing a sublet renter to fulfill the contract. Housing is hard enough to secure and she'll potentially have a ding against her record which limits her future housing options.", "OP and friend would have to start on a new lease because ll won't do a sublet", "You clearly didn\u2019t read the original post closely enough", "I know what you are saying, completely agree.
