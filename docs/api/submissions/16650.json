We own 8 hens all rescued. I like to let the hens out to explore outside their coop. Right outside is a fenced in area with a pond. Unfortunately the hens can go under the fence onto the main garden but it\u2019s pretty easy for me to catch them. \n\nLast Sunday was the first time I let the hens explore the pond area. During that time was also a church service going on. My aunt and uncle are in charge of the church so they allow me to let the hens out. Last Sunday was hell for me. I had about 10 kids in the pond area splashing the water and being loud. I\u2019m not good at telling kids off I hate it.  So this Sunday I talked to both my aunt and the man who is supposed to run this project and they agree with it. The plan was to only allow kids in if their parents and/or guardians are with them. My aunt was supposed to announce this but she forget about parental supervision. A young boy came up to the pond area and I told him he can\u2019t come in unless he is with his parents. He runs off back to his mum. I thought great now she can come supervision or tell her son to wait till service is over to come see the hens. Nope she came over and told me off. I was soo thankful that a woman who helps run the garden was with me and she spoke up for me. I am terrible at confrontation of any kind. I did tell her that it was supposed to be announced but didn\u2019t. She then had the audacity to say that we as adults (I\u2019m 22f) could let 6 kids in at a time and we can handle it. I just stood there dumbfounded and hurt as i tried last week and couldn\u2019t handle it. I\u2019m not there for the kids I\u2019m there for the hens. \n\nLater on I get a message from the hens group chat and she wrote a rant about how embarrassed her kid was to be sent back. She then suggested to wait till service is over to let the hens out. I was sooo pissed. I didn\u2019t mean to embarrass the kid but I get overwhelmed very easily yes he want there last week but other kids were and from that experience I learnt to let the parents handle their kids. I told my aunt to deal with her and now we going to have a church meeting about it next Sunday which she won\u2019t even be there for. \n\nAITA for trying saying no to this kid and to go get his parents to be allowed in.", "created_utc": 1683481628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13axgv8/aita_for_telling_a_kid_to_not_enter_the_chicken/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Telling kids they need their parent to do something is 100% the norm. That parent is entitled and it's only a matter of time until her kid gets hurt and she tries to blame everyone but herself. Sign firm, post signs of the rules, and don't let an idiot parent bully you into a bad decision.", "NTA Your responsibility is to keep the chickens safe, and it's the parents responsibility to supervise their kids, if that mother couldn't be bothered to supervise her own child (after being told the new rules) then that's on her.", "NTA.   \nThe kid will get over it. They are just upset they didn't get what they want when they wanted it. The safety of the chickens needs to come first; they could be easily harmed by a crazy child who is not being supervised. And it's not your job to watch someone else's kid.", "Have Aunt and Uncle talk with the Church owner or pastor or whomever is over the church. Have them explain that the children's safety is very important and that it is entirely unsafe to have children unsupervised near open bodies of water or chickens who are very unpredictable (confession: I'm terrified of chickens, but they don't come up in my everyday life lol).\n\nSigns are a good idea. \n\nParents having kids they don't want to teach about boundaries is bad.\n\nNTA.", " Nope NtA. She\u2019s just an entitled woman who thinks she should get whatever her (&her kid) want.", "NTA - You made a wise statement. Unsupervised kids can be hurt or injure the chickens. Yes, parents need to be present and mind their kids.  \n\nI volunteer at an animal rescue. No one under 18 can be a volunteer or interact with animals without an adult (non volunteer). This is necessary due to insurance; a business who has statistics indicating 'shit happens'. If the rule is broken the rescue will be liable. Best to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A second part is to protect the safety of anything that can hurt by the thing you are taking care of.  Chickens bite and scratch\u2014and they are filthy.  Infection is a real risk to people when handling chickens.  You would be doing a disservice to everyone if you didn't enforce this rule. \n\nI respectfully disagree with the advice about the message your relatives announce to people.  This is not a new rule... and it's not a request that kids need to be supervised.  They should give it Las a reminder for everyone's safety, adding that if there continues to be a problem, *nobody* will be able to interact with the chickens.  This is potential liability for whoever owns the property.  A soft announcement undermines your authority to keep people and chickens safe.\n\nA suggestion for you to help when you have to give information or stand your ground over rules you are meant to enforce:  Don't think of it as \"telling someone off\" as this just creates a negative mindset for you.  Explaining the rules and keeping someone safe is not the same thing.  It's just information sharing and, in the mother's case, reinforcing limits. \n\nThis mother was looking for entertainment for her kid so she didn't have to be bothered with supervising it... that won't change if she attends with her child in the future.  Keep an you on her!   She's awful, and it's not ok that you have had to deal with her.   But you will encounter people like this your whole life.   Now is the best time to practice different techniques so you can become more confidant with these types of interactions. \n\nYou are doing the right thing... there's nothing here for you to feel bad about! \n\nNTA", "There is actually sign saying that the kids need to be supervised but it goes out of the window during church time. It\u2019s frustrating", "Thanks I literally cried over this situation.", "Right? Chickens are perfectly capable of being nasty if they want to be. Only takes a second for a kid to get scratched up, pecked in the face or something like that.", "I wish I said that to her. But I completely froze up lol", "Thank you for your reply this does really help me", "Funny thing my aunt and uncle run the church. They are both pastors of the church.", "I don\u2019t really know her personally but she does come across entitled in this situation not sure how she is in a non church environment", "Thank you. Same to you.", "So parents and kids ignore the sign? What do they say when you say, \"Do you see that sign? Those are the rules. Please come back when your parents are with you.\"", "Oh, honey. You are not the problem here.", "That's understandable if you don't like conflict, so don't feel bad for not telling her off. \n\nYour aunt and uncle definitely need to explain the new rules to the parents there though, and if they put up a sign then you can just tell that mother (and other entitled parents) to read it, and they need to keep on reading it until the message finally sinks in for them.", "Agreed with NTA!\nThe fact that the hens are explicitly your task (rather than your whole family helping out with the whole setup, from the church to the pond and the animals) makes it even more so!\n\nMy little brother used to also have trouble speaking up. He took a few courses where they roleplayed a lot. The aim was don't get distracted from the message you want to share, no matter how outrageous the other person + experience that the sky doesn't fall down on you if you say no to someone.\nIt helped him a lot, so maybe you can try that?", "Then suggest that they do an announcement from the pulpit so that every member of the church is clear on the rules. A Pastor's job isn't to coddle the flock, but to shepherd (spelling?) them.", "I have no idea. They probably say you are already in here so supervise them. The sign does not state that the parents have to be there it only says that kids must be supervised at all times.", "Thank you. That makes me feel better.", "That\u2019s a good idea. Got a meeting next Sunday so will defo recommend signs to be put up with clear rules. Thanks for your input", "I shall definitely give that a go. Thank you", "My aunt was supposed to but completely forgot about parental supervision part.", "I'm so hungry, can you please fry up your hens for me?\n\nIIRC his exercises started with outlandish over the top situations: that makes it clearer it's not real and you don't have to worry about the stakes.\n\nGood luck!", "Next week she should say something along the lines of 'I apologize for not mentioning it last week, but we request that any children visiting the pond and chicken habitat, be supervised by an adult.

But this is the solution that I want to have.", "I hope it goes well. I'm not religious, but I imagine some feelings will get hurt, but it boils down to insurance reasons too. If your provider learns that children learns that children are running willy nilly around water there is a chance the premium could go up depending on your locality. This unfortunately probably would be 'discovered' after a child gets hurt and your aunt and uncle's church gets hit with a lawsuit."]}
