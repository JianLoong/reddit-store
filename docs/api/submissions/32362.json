You don't need to explain everything. Once you start \"discussing reservations,\" you are giving her problems to solve. You say, \"I'm worried about X,\" and she says, \"Here's a solution to X.\" You don't need to include her in your decision-making process!\n\nHere is some advice that I've taken to heart. Never loan money to friends or family **unless**, you are willing to treat it as a gift. You can still try to collect! The point is, don't loan money if you aren't comfortable losing it. That doesn't sound like the situation you are in. If there's a smaller amount that you **are** comfortable losing, you could offer that amount. But only if you really are comfortable! It's fine if you aren't.", "NtA. No is a full answer. You don't need to justify why you don't want to lend them money anymore,  and even if you did, their past behavior should be enough examples for why not.\n\nThat you have more money compared to them doesn't entitle them to some of your money.", "NTA. A lot of people advise you to treat loans to family members as gifts if you\u2019re going to do that. Where you are either unwilling or unable to give this person the money she needs without an expectation of repayment it is best that you do not give the money at all. Unfortunately you can\u2019t expect this person to graciously accept your decision or to still wish to be friendly to you afterwards, but it was wrong of her to put you in this position to begin with.", "NTA\n\n> in the past where I've extended financial help, and unfortunately, the repayments didn't happen as smoothly as we agreed upon. It's created some hesitancy on my part, and I've expressed my concerns about the past situations not being resolved amicably.\n\nI would say NAH, but here she's already demonstrated that she's an unreliable debtor.", "NTA. With family/close friends, if you can\u2019t afford/aren\u2019t willing to give the money as a gift, don\u2019t do it. The potential for lasting ill-feeling in both directions is just too great. And that\u2019s even *before* you\u2019ve been given solid reason to think you won\u2019t be paid back as agreed", "NTA.\n\nIt's easier to loan out to family what you can write off comfortably.  Family is lot trickier because there are so many other relationship strings rather than just a strict impersonal bank loan.\n\nIf you are not comfortable writing it off, then consider not loaning in the first place.", "NTA. Never reveal how much money you have. Always be broke. We have been smart with our finances and have a decent amount of money. I\u2019m willing to share that info on Reddit and with my young adult kids as they navigate financial adulting. But IRL if anyone notices something new I bought - I had a coupon or it was a gift.  When I married my husband, in-laws would ask for money. Sorry we don\u2019t have extra. Nope I don\u2019t have money to pay for your meal/ticket/admission. They stop asking eventually. In truth, we\u2019re pretty comfortable financially.  But if you ask for money, I\u2019m broke as hell.", "Nta you can just lie and say you don\u2019t have it. If she isn\u2019t willing to have a grown up discussion about your reservations then she doesn\u2019t deserve the truth. \n\nShe also maybe needs to learn the consequences of living above your budget and she needs to do without instead of asking for your help and then not repaying you.", "NTA\n\nIf SIL owes money for medical bills, then she ALREADY owes the money.  If she's going to pay it back, it shouldn't matter to her whether she owes the money to medical providers or to you.  But it certainly matters to you, especially if SIL isn't good about repaying debts.  \n\nIn other words, SIL can make payments on her medical debts.  You don't need to be involved at all.\n\n\"Sorry, but I've had difficulty getting repaid after lending some people money in the past, so I no longer lend money.\"", "NTA. Do not lend her anything.", "NTA.  Instead of getting into drawn out discussions of why you can\u2019t/will not lend her money. Just say no.

Which is it?", "NTA\n\nContinuing to lend money when it is not really affordable and may/may not be paid back promptly is something you don't want to do. Your relationship with your SIL may be affected, buy if it is it will be no fault of your own. It sounds as if she's reworking her denied request into a demand; not at good look on her.", "NTA OP .Say after reviewing your finances you cannot lend it .She may really be in more in trouble now than in the past but her past actions predict she will not quickly repay you .\n\nMany medical debts can be put in a payment plan .Suggest she look into that.Some communities help low income families with home repair .She came to you because you have lent her money before ,Sadly she taught you she is not reliable .", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. You do not have to justify how you spend your money. If that\u2019s too blunt for you, tell her you cannot afford it. \nDo not engage in arguments or excuses with her as she will just continue to try to wear you down.", "NTA. I would not be so coy about why you're refusing either. You already gave her your concerns about how past situations were not resolved amicably, and she dares to ask for more? Sounds like she needs to hit up someone else so they can see exactly what you've been dealing with.", "NTA.  All you need to say is \"Unfortunately, I can't\".  If she asks why not (which I hate when people do that, but I'm sure she will), you can say, \"Like I said, I can't.  It's very personal\".", "NTA. I've learnt the hard way.. Don't lend family or friends money.", "NTA - just tell her you had your own unexpected bills and you can\u2019t spare it.", "NTA. Take the tensions and keep your money! You are not a bank or a charity.", "Nta you're not obligated to lend anyone money, especially someone that unreliable.", "NAH", "She was asking money for treatment, the mention of her home was because she\u2019s come into financial problems as a result of having to fix some issues with her pipes and some mold, which came before the treatment was needed", "What is the \"treatment\"? Something for a life threatening condition? Or just getting a wart burned off? There's a big difference there.\n\nIt's your money, and money lent to a family member should always be considered as potentially lost. But if this medical treatment is for something serious and you have the means to help but don't, there will certainly be a negative effect to your relationship with her.\n\nNAH. She has asked, you can refuse."]}
