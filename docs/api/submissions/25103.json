All you can do is let the relationship crash and burn if it\u2019s going to. Trying to keep two kids apart never works so I think your efforts are wasted.", "NTA Mikey violated the most basic rules.  If it would be me I would make it clear that Poppy would never be welcomed in my house and I will never attend any even where she is present.", "Doubt this is true", "NTA - your son is 18 an needs the reality check that his relationship toxic. Yes, under most circumstances I would say this was not ok, but this girl is starting to come between family and is a bully.", "This sounds like it was written by a 13yo, not a grown ass person with kids. For the love of god I hope it's fake.", "NTA. This is definitely a difficult situation, though emotional reactions won't do anything with Mikey. Just do your best to support Kayden", "NTA, but an emotional response (instead of logical) is rarely helpful and in this case it may have been harmful to the overall situation", "Poppy sounds like absolute poison. You do hear stories about people falling for their partner's sibling, its not right but it happens. But I don't get why she and her friends would bully Kayden, or why Mikey would be with someone who does that. It has nothing to do with love. \n\nI can't help but think something doesn't quite add up here, could there be something that Kayden hasn't told you about his relationship with Poppy?", "Harsh but honest-\n\nYou failed your sons, as a parent.  I'm a twin whose parents failed us.  For a twin to have such little disregard for the person he's been with since conception is a testimony to that.  Any fallout the cheating twin experiences is 100% deserved.", "ESH except Kayden, that poor guy.\n\nThere is a time and place for everything and your kids are now adults.  You should be teaching them to act like adults, not fueling the fire, and that's all I have to say about that.\n\nYour point is definitely valid, but delivery makes a difference.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProbably not the only shitty parenting, considering how your kid turned out to be.", "Esh", "ESH\nIn terms of teaching your kids how to be well rounded compassionate adults by your example setting, you failed quite badly at the dinner table.", "Nta", "I would kick mikey out of my house tbh.
