I assumed the parents were staying at a motel nearby. On the last day of B moving out, our new flatmate (Y) was moving in with the help of their parents  (another high school classmate so all knew each other). Y\u2019s parents were staying over at a motel and they thought B\u2019s parents were doing the same but they were curious so asked B\u2019s parents where they stayed to which they said my room (which meant in my bed and I\u2019ve only met B\u2019s parents once, when we were all moving in). Y and Y\u2019s parents both thought I already knew about this. When Y, E and I were texting (about stuff that happened in the flat while B was moving out) Y mentioned to us that B\u2019s parents stayed in my room. I obviously was shocked as I wasn\u2019t informed about so I texted B asking if their parents stayed in my room to which they replied \u201cyes\u201d. I blew up on them saying how rude and inconsiderate it was when they should\u2019ve asked me first and now I have to wash all my bedding once I get back down to the flat and that I expect them to pay me for how much it costs to get it all washed, petrol money (washing it in the flat would take ~4 hrs so taking it to a laundry place would be faster) and the inconvenience as I don\u2019t arrive at flat till ~ 9pm (flight tickets were booked ages ago, before B decided to move out). \n\nHowever, B hasn\u2019t checked the messages since replying \u201cyes\u201d and I sent those messages 7 days ago and they have been online everyday since. E also had a situation happen with B during the time but when E texted B and even tried to call them to sort the situation between them out, B has not looked at the messages nor picked up the calls. I\u2019m planning to message B\u2019s sibling in the morning to hopefully sort the situation out as I think the sibling will be able to understand me since B is actively ignoring my messages. Also B knows that I\u2019m not ok with anyone using my stuff without my permission as B throughout the year has gone into my room while I\u2019m not home to take my stuff to use without asking to which I only find out when I try to look for it as I need to use it. So I end up asking B if they have seen my stuff to which they usually respond with \u201coh I have it\u201d and they go grab it from their room to give it back. Each time I\u2019ve said to them, I don\u2019t mind if they use my stuff as long as they ask me. I\u2019m just wondering if IATA for reacting the way I did. \n\n(PS all of my stuff is still in my room at the flat and I am obviously paying rent for my room even when I\u2019m not physically living there)\n\nEdit: would messaging B\u2019s sibling also make me the ahole\nEdit: I\u2019ll try contacting the parents instead", "created_utc": 1673530379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109zr4k/aita_for_reacting_the_way_i_did_when_flatmate_let/", "score": 289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is breach of privacy. Set some boundaries, you paid for rent so get a rule for B.", "It is really pretty simple, people don't get to sleep in your bed without your explicit permission. NTA.", "Letting anyone (even parents) stay in someones room without asking instantly makes them the AH regardless of anything else.", "Yeah, an obvious NTA. Seriously overstepping of boundaries there.", "NTA and B obviously doesn't care what you say about your boundaries which is quite evident from their actions.", "NTA, but being in the right and drinking poison to kill someone else are different things. Are you going to get laundry money? Doubtful. Do you live with this person anymore? No, so you won't have to see them much anymore. Think of your inconvenience as the worth it amount to eject someone from your life.", "Maybe you should renting out B's room on airbnb when they're not there. NTA, I'd be furious. Get a lock, now.", "NTA, that's wild to do without permission", "NTA.\nStandard Operating Procedure is for parents to get a hotel or airbnb of their own.\n\nThey didn't evev ask you and didn't launder your bedding afterwards! Good grief.", "**NTA**\n\nWhen you rent a room in a flat, WHETHER YOU ARE PRESENT OR NOT, the use of that room and its contents belong EXCLUSIVELY to you. That is literally what you are paying for: the exclusive maintenance of that space for your use, so no one else should even be entering it as long as you are paying rent, without your explicit permission. Think of it like a hotel room: when you pay for a hotel room on vacation, other people don't get to wander in and out of it and have a little nap in your bed or use your bathroom while you're out on a tour during the day. The hotel room is yours and only yours for as long as you're paying for it. The same is true of your room in the flat.\n\nWhat your flatmate did - allowing their parents to have use of your room while you weren't there, without your permission - isn't just obnoxious, it's likely in contravention of your lease. I would explain to them that if they do it again, you're going to let your landlord know that they are not respecting the terms of the lease/contract, and are having guests in to stay in spaces that are not theirs per the lease, and that if they don't want to be out on their ear, you expect them to respect the space that YOU ARE PAYING FOR. That ought to rattle their cage. \n\nI would also contact the parents if you can, but honestly, they may not care. They're the ones that raised this obnoxious kid . . . Either way, you're NTA.", "I don't know if you have your roommate's parents phone number but you need to contact them to let them know what their child has done and what position their own child has put them in. Because it might be that the parents believed from your roommate that they had explicit permission to sleep in that room. hich I highly recommend that you read up on). Keep the text messages between your roommate and any other evidence of this trespass, even if your roommate doesn't reply it will show that she is ignoring you. Even if you don't want to criminally charge them, this knowledge could possibly be used as leverage in this situation.\n\nI don't know if you have your roommate's parents phone number  or social media but you need to contact them to let them know what their child has done and what position their own child has put them in. Because it might be the case that the parents were misled to believe from your roommate that they had explicit permission to sleep in your room, from you, when they did not.", "NTA, but this would be a lot easier to read if broken into paragraphs.", "YTA - Yes you are right, they should have either asked before sleeping in your bed. But \"blowing up\" and demanding the cost of one load of laundry (plus petrol expences) is too far over the top for such a minor slight. You were wronged and then acted like a pouty asshole.\n\nIt might save everyone a bit of drama if B were to wash your sheets before you got back to the apartment.", "NTA\n\nB should have asked and it sounds like she is intentionally ignoring you. \n\nReach out to the parents and not the siblings. They stayed in the room and if B doesn\u2019t pay, they should.", "NTA for being mad but messaging the siblings who have nothing to do with this would make you TA", "NTA, it is an invasion of privacy, and not asking was AH move, but do you really need to have it professionally cleaned/taken elsewhere? You could put clean sheets on and wash the rest, assuming you have a second set of bedding. Maybe one of the other flatmate could be kind enough to put it on for you as you will be arriving late. Washing the bedding will take a long time but you can do other things while your washing machine runs and it may not cost as much. Honestly not sure you will ever get any financial compensation. If you want to contact B, maybe you could go through social media, but after this I would probably go NC with B, which is what they seem to be doing anyway.", "NTA.  B obviously got their lack of boundaries from their parents.", "NTA. It is definitely NOT okay to allow guests to sleep in your roommate's bed! Even worse to not wash and change the sheets (both before and after)!!", "NTA, that\u2019s a crazy situation, in additional to cleaning money ask for 1/10th the rent as they\u2019ve been staying in your room for 3 days.", "NTA.

In the meantime I would get a web connected security camera and locks for your room so when you are not there no one can get in.", "NTA, I would\u2019ve blown up on her ages ago already for going into my room and taking stuff when I\u2019m not there. This just takes the cake.", "NTA. But you already said B moved out, so do you really expect them to get in contact with you again?", "ETA obviously they should not have done that but being petty over maybe 3 dollars of soap and trying to harass them into paying for it is just as wrong", "Have paragraphs gone out of fashion all of a sudden?", "YTA. There is a lot of baggage and this is just the newest and easiest fight to pick. You didn't ask if you were TA for being upset, but instead your reaction and maybe calling their sibling. \n\n\nAnyways, messaging B's sibling is only going to make you appear more unhinged. B does not give a shit anymore and you should do the same. Time to move on.", "ESH yes they should have asked but there was no harm really done, going nuclear won't get you anywhere. Realistically noone else is going to care about this as much as you do.\n Just chalk it up to experience and move on with your life.", "There\u2019s not rly a way to add locks to the door but I did have my door closed (asked my BF to before B even got to the flat)", "Thanks for the response, I\u2019ll contact the parents instead then. I thought maybe it\u2019ll be too much to do so", "The only issue is I don\u2019t have the contacts for the parents, but I do for the older sibling who I\u2019ve talked to before as they stayed in the flat for a week. However, finding the socials of one of the parents isn\u2019t too difficult if need be", "Yeah this is what I was thinking.  I can see why you are upset and feel like he should make it up to you, but he already moved out and you messaging the siblings or the parents is just going to make you seem crazy.  It won\u2019t happen again, as you don\u2019t live together anymore, and I would consider it the cost of learning what an asshole this person is and just not talk to them anymore.  \n\nMaybe use the situation as an opportunity to sit down with your current flat mates to discuss expectations, boundaries, etc moving forward.", "Yeah that\u2019s understandable. I thought B finally understood my boundaries when they did start to ask me for my permission before using my stuff.", "You\u2019ve voted twice in your post.

Also everyone is on summer break and I\u2019m the first one back at the flat. Tbh if B doesn\u2019t give me financial compensation in the end it\u2019s not a big deal.

Worse, in this situation, OP said it would take about 4 hours to wash their bedding in the flat, which is fine if you have a day to devote to it, but ridiculous when you've just gotten back in town at 9 PM, so wanting to go take the bedding elsewhere to at least be able to do it quickly is perfectly understandable. This is all a big mess and huge inconvenience and an expense for OP, and entirely the result of a thoughtless, inconsiderate, selfish flatmate. Since the flatmate is ignoring messages from former flatmates about multiple problems he caused as he left, reaching out to his parents \u2013 who, let us recall, are the ones who soiled OP's bedding \u2013 is perfectly reasonable. Maybe they don't know what an AH their son is, in which case they need to be made aware of it so they try to teach him better now. Regardless, either they can make their son pay what he should, or they can do it themselves, but none of this is OP's fault, and since he can't escape the time burden of repairing it, the very, *very* least he should be able to expect is being compensated for it all.", "NTA do you have Venmo or something similar?
