He wasn\u2019t a bad dad, just not a good one. His career came before everything else including his children. He missed more games, recitals, and birthdays than he made. One good thing was that he treated us equally and didn\u2019t play favorites. On our bday, everyone got $100 cash, no more, no less. When my brother (Tom, 40) went on a school trip, dad gave me the same amount he paid toward the trip. When I got married first, dad put the exact amount he paid for my wedding into a bond and gave it to my Tom for his future wedding. Another good thing about dad is that he keeps his word. If he tells you something, he\u2019ll crawl on his hands and knees to make it happen. One time I was in a play and begged him to come to see it opening night. He was out of the country on a business trip at the time but he said he\u2019ll come. He flew in that night, sat in the front row, bought me flowers, and flew out in the morning.\n\nMy mother is a different story. Tom was her favorite at his birth. Growing up, it was clear she loves him more. In her eyes, he could do no wrong. Once he got expelled from school and she tried to sue the school. When he got arrested the first time for drunk driving, she tried to sue the police. Both cases were thrown out by the judges before they went to trial because they were so silly. My parents used to argue constantly because she favored Tom so much. They finally divorced.\n\nIn his 20s, Tom dated a stripper and dad disapproved. The last straw was when he brought her home for my grandmother\u2019s bday. It was obvious she was high so dad tried to kick them out. As Tom and dad argued in the backyard, his gf went into the bathroom to do more drugs and OD. After the ambulance and police left, dad told Tom that he\u2019s done with him as long as he\u2019s with her. Tom ended up marrying her a couple of years later and true to his word, dad never spoke to him again.\n\nFast forward to now. I have 3 kids and Tom has 2. Dad was never a good dad but he\u2019s a great grandfather to my kids. He attends every one of their games, recitals, and bdays. I never spent a dime on babysitting because he gets his feelings hurt if he doesn\u2019t get to babysit. If hubby or I ever want to spend a couple of hours alone, dad is ready to pick up my kids. They love him as much as he loves them. \n\nTom and I have a relationship but we\u2019re not close. However, dad has not spoken to Tom and has nothing to do with his kids. My oldest turn 15 and have been talking about getting a car. Dad told my kids that he put $20,000 in bonds for their first cars and will give me the bonds as they each turn 18. My kids excitedly told their cousins then Tom called me furious. He raged about how unfair dad is. I told him that dad told him that he\u2019s cut off as long as Tom is with her. Tom said it shouldn\u2019t affect his kids and wants me to talk to dad about giving his kids $20,000 each as they\u2019re supposed to be treated equally. I refused because it\u2019s dad\u2019s money, he worked hard for it and can spend it anyways he wants to. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667594480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym9tdb/aita_for_not_trying_to_convince_my_dad_to_treat/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad sounds pretty great to be honest.  He keeps his word and it\u2019s clear he loves you.  That\u2019s not as common as you think.  Tom needs to work out his relationship with your dad.  Don\u2019t get in the middle, it will only lead to drama and pain.  When he questions you about your dad, just tell him he needs to make that relationship right, not you.  Tom needs a heavy dose of personal responsibility.", "NTA. I will be one though to point out that punishing Tom's kids for Tom & his wife's sins is not a good look. Of course you don't want to get involved because if Grandad starts treating Tom's kids the way he treats yours, he will not be at your beck and call for babysitting.", "NTA.  this is for tom and your dad to work out amongst themselves.  we see a ton of posts about how family members will try to interject themselves into conflict, only to find themselves cut off too.\n\nif tom wants your dad to be a granddad, he has to be the one to talk to your dad, not you.", "Can I suggest you not get in between you and the two of them.  This is their battle.  If Tom comes to you, refer him on to your father.  There is no way in hell that your Dad will have a change in heart just because you spoke to him.", "Absolutely NTA, you said it its your dads money, Tom can keep the spoils mommy gives him . He went and disappointed your father and let him down I\u2019m sure he hasn\u2019t apologized for anything he did, Tom is still hiding under the skirts of others instead of facing things himself. Let him be mad , the only reason he really wanted a bond between your father and children so they would benefit monetary.Dont let him get to you .", "NTA. This relationship problem is between Tom and your dad. You can't fix any of the damage there. They're both grown men who can sort this out themselves.", "NTA for your specific question, since that isn't your fight but for the overall situation everyone sucks.\n\nDoesn't matter if SIL is a stripper and there was no reason to include that except to stigmatize her. Mentioning her job tells me you think less of her for it and want us to as well, which is an AH move. \n\nSIL is an AH for using drugs at at family function to the point of a medical emergency, but she's also a human and humans can grow and change. Is she still addicted? Does she parent her children well? Does she make your brother happy? Is she still causing problems aside from your dad somehow deciding she'll never be good enough? Basically, I haven't heard anything from you that suggests she's still a problem in recent years \n\nI think your dad sucks for ignoring one set of grandkids for something they can't control. It's within his rights, but it's an AH move and cruel to those children, ESPECIALLY since they get to hear how good grandpa spoils their cousins. \n\nYour brother sucks for trying to put you in the middle of this.\n\nAnd your mom sucks for coddling him from any accountability.", "NTA. This is between your dad and Tom.", ">Tom was her favorite at his birth. Growing up, it was clear she loves him more. In her eyes, he could do no wrong\n\nDid Tom try to convince mom to treat you equally? Just wondering. NTA. You have a good heart for sticking up for golden boy"]}
