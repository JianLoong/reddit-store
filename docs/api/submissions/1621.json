We were close in our childhood but lost touch growing up and barely interacted. I got to know from my parents she was getting married and I was really happy for her.\n\nHowever I got to know a couple days later that her parents are totally against it as they found out he was previously married with 3 kids and as per her parents their affair began while he was still married to his ex (my cousin denied it). They refused to participate in the wedding and tried to convince her to reconsider it. They involved other people including my parents and everyone tried their best to either persuade my cousin or convince her parents to give her their blessings.\n\nI talked to my cousin about it and she said they are in love and she cannot imagine life without him. I told her it's her life so she can do whatever she wants but I agree with her parents and I won't play a part in convincing them to bless her. Her parents finally agreed and everyone from the family attended the wedding.\n\nYesterday my cousin called to tell me she cannot live with the man. She says he hardly helps her in chores and his kids absolutely dislike her. They also have a difference in religious opinions and he tries to impose it on her. I asked her if any DV was involved to which she said no. She asked me to help her out as her parents are not ready to help out. I told her I can lend money if that's an issue. She says she needs emotional support now and I should help her mend her relationship with her parents. I absolutely refused. \n\nShe kept on pushing on how I should help her out as she married this man for love but got deceived etc. I pointed out that she wilfully ignored everyone's advice and now she wants help when things have gone south. I told her I can only provide temporary financial help but she should not expect more from me. She started sobbing and called me names.

It's also understandable that she's upset by that, as long as she's not lashing out at you. \n\nShe becomes the AH when she pushes your boundaries, though. She needs to accept your \"no.\"", "NTA willfully had a relationship with a man who had a wife and kids,  didnt care of the impact to his kids, didnt think for a second that they'd rightfully despise her. She thought a man who was so weak to cheat would be a good  partner? Lololol she went with a guy who didnt care for his wife or kids feelings and married someone 18 years younger. She knew his religion before. And she should have lived with him or been in a relationship for a couple of years before marrying someone with kids anyway.\n\nShe absolutely does not deserve any emotional support. \n\nYou offered money, you asked about DV. Am sure her family would also pluck her out if he did become violent too. But she deserves zero emotional sympathy.  She can give that to his wife and kids.", "NTA\n\nShe should have taken the guidance whenever it was volunteered. It sounds like she needs to work on taking a little responsibility for her life and her current situation.", "NTA.  You and your cousin were not even close anymore in your adulthood. Why in the world with anyone expect you to suddenly be obligated to be there for someone that did not try to have a relationship with you, broke up somebody else\u2019s marriage, and now expect you to be there for them because nobody else is. This is not your obligation. She created this mess.  This is not someone that even listens to guidance or instruction.  Yes, people can say whatever the heck they want but at the end of the day, this is not your responsibility! Misery loves company, so she is going to call anyone that is going to answer and try to push her problems onto them. I wouldn\u2019t answer those phone calls if I were you.  I wouldn\u2019t let this ruin my day.", "NTA. He will do your cousin dirty too.", "NTA. What exactly does your cousin expect you to do? It seems like she tries to use family to avoid facing the consequences of her actions. Her parents are unhappy she had an affair with a married man old enough to be her father and is now marrying them? Refuse to admit any wrongdoing and get family to bully her parents into supporting her! She finds out she married nothing but a fantasy and his children (rightfully) hate her for being a willing participant in breaking up their parent\u2019s marriage? Get her cousin to pressure her parents to supporting her without the \u2018I told you so\u2019s\u2019. \n\nYour coins in needs to accept responsibility for her poor choice and go cap in hand to her parents and apologise. Not your monkeys, not your circus.", "NTA. 45\u2026 I mean without details it\u2019s entirely possible those \u201ckids\u201d are legally adults, but if we are generous they\u2019re almost certainly over 10 - thus old enough to not like their dads AP. And a 45 year old man not helping with household chores who had also been willing to have an affair with a coworker 18 years younger than him? Well colour me shocked, it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t respect women in his home life /s. \n\nIt sucks for your cousin, but she insisted in learning through trial by fire. She had no shortage of people telling her this wasn\u2019t going to be her happily ever after with talking animals and rainbows that she imagined. \n\nYou did the right thing by confirming there was no DV, and for offering her financial assistance if she wants out. But I\u2019m 100% with you, anything else she needs to figure out how to deal with the consequences of her own impulsive actions.", "NTA.\n\n>I pointed out that she wilfully ignored everyone's advice and now she wants help when things have gone south.\n\nYea, this. Don't get me wrong, anyone can be tricked by sweet talking, but you are not responsible for your cousin's mistakes. You also already offered her financial help, if she wants emotional support then she needs to find a therapist.\n\nAlso there were so many red flags before the marriage (he had 3 kids, she was the affair partner, almost 20 year age gap) and she still went ahead with the marriage. She made this choice and now she has to deal with the consequences of it, and her calling you names is just trying to make herself feel less guilty about f-ing things up for herself.", "NTA but she doesn't need emotional support right now,  she needs an exit plan asap. That's what you need to offer help for. She needs to get out now because her husband just ripped off his mask to reveal his true self to her. Things will not get better in that marriage. She's trying the suck cost fallacy to justify staying in that marriage to herself and everyone else. Let her know that her parents,  you and the rest of the family love her and that her getting out now won't be seen as a failure but her rectifying a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes and bad judgments but it's how you recover from them that people really remember. Her getting a divorce or annulment will definitely be seen as a great thing by everyone who loves her.", "NTA. She made her bed, she can lie in it. You don't owe her anything, this is a consequence of her actions same as any other.", "NTA\n\nYou're very calm op. If it was me...i'd prolly be laughing at her. \"you wanted this. YOU WANTED THIS.\"", "INFO: Why are you refusing to help cousin mend her relationship with her parents? No doubt she's going to have to endure endless I-told-you-so's. Par for the course.", "YTA ''i told you so''> compasion it appears. you didnt listen to me?? now suffer well. oh my god people is rotten", "NTA, her interpersonal relationships are her\u2019s to manage including her parents, husband, friends, and family. Encourage her to speak with parents and husband directly to resolve their problems. Her problems are complex I think a professional would offer the best aid in this situation. Encourage her to seek a personal therapist, marriage counseling, spiritual counseling, and family counseling (especially for her and new step kids).\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sounds like she understands that you are limited in role in the ways you can assist as this is her life to live and manage. She needs to see the error in her ways herself in order to learn from them and everyone learns at their own pace.\n\nFocus on yourself, learn from her mistakes. You 25 for Gods sake live it up have fun, be smart, explore, build your career, educate yourself, find a healthy loving relationship. The world is yours. Don\u2019t allow your cousin bring you into her drama and insult you. It\u2019s not worth it.", "YTA. What is most important here? Reminding her that she made a mistake or helping her fix her mistake? There is a middle path here: get her out of the marriage and after that she can reconcile with her parents.", "YTA.  She has realized her mistake and is asking for help.  Do you want her stuck there until she accidentally is pregnant and then has a baby with this disastrous situation?  Be supportive, help her get out and help her find legal help.  Everyone turning their back on her is only going to make the situation 100 times worse.\n\nIt\u2019s like everyone wants her to be in this bad situation as punishment (we told you so)because she didn\u2019t do what they told her to begin with\u2026so sad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Am I the asshole here?\n\nNTA.  She made several bad decisions, and each time she was warned against them, she doubled down and insisted on doing them anyway.  She's got a blind spot.\n\nToday she says she wants out. What about tomorrow, if her new husband gets wind she wants a divorce, and shows up with a dozen roses and tries to sweep her off her feet to avoid another costly divorce?  She's shown more than once she prefers the fantasy of true love to harsh reality, until reality painfully broke through. \n\nUnfortunately women with blind spots that big and that persistent often don't leave the first time harsh reality breaks through the fantasy.  They bounce back and forth, and even if they do get away, the underlying blind spot often leads them to more bad relationship choices. \n\nHer best bet at this point is to see a professional therapist, to:\n\n\\* understand the flaws in her thinking that led her to make the bad decisions\n\n\\* learn to take accountability for her choices, no matter how they turn out, and stop blaming other people when things go wrong\n\n\\* learn that it's not reasonable to approach someone you once knew, but neglected for years, and demand big favors on a short timeline\n\nYou offered her what she needed to fix the situation herself, staying back from the drama at a safe distance.

I have to say, I'm surprised she realized what a bad fit they are so quickly.  Was she not living with him before the marriage??  It seems like most of these issues she would have been aware of before the wedding, or else they would have taken longer than a month to become clear after the wedding.\n\nRegardless, I don't understand what she is looking for here.    Her parents attended her wedding a MONTH ago. However unhappy they were about it, they still chose to place their relationship with their daughter above any upset.  What relationship is she looking to repair with them now?  I would think they would be happy to see their daughter free of this situation.\n\nYes, she was dead wrong to have an affair with a married man and father.  But he was TWENTY YEARS older than her, and sounds like he has the potential to be a controlling or even abusive person.  She screwed up in her 20s and has paid the price.  Let her get free of this terrible mistake and move on with her life.", "Any chance she will end up staying with him because she has no help leaving?", "OP did offer financial support which could be used to pay for legal support and help the sister move out of the situation she's in.\n\nOP just can't offer emotional support after everything that happened. If OP grits her teeth tried to give her sister emotional support, it won't be genuine and this could just make things worse."]}
