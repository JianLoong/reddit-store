Prior to us being together she was very anti-pets, zero interest. I\u2019d always wanted a cat. We talked and with heavy persuasion from me, ended up getting a Bengal from a breeder. She turned out to be very skittish, so we got her a Bengal sibling to maybe help. Neither of them are super cuddly so we added a calico who is. All of these were joint decisions. Wife feeds them, I do litter box, water, meds, and google solutions to any issues that come up.\n\nWe just bought a house and I do most of the cleaning: vacuuming, dusting, tubs, laundry, etc. This was the case when I worked but more so since I\u2019ve been unemployed for 4 months. \n\nI\u2019ve felt discontent with the cats since we moved because I have to clean constantly to stay on top of the shed hair, the food mess, the litter tracked everywhere. They randomly throw up on rugs and pooped on the hardwood floor(vet visit showed nothing wrong). They\u2019ve ripped out the bottoms of a new sofa set and scratched up the other. And wife frets about the cats being sad when we go out of town, even though my sister watches them for free each time.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019m over them and want to rehome them responsibly. The first alone and the last 2 together. I\u2019ve mentioned it before and was met with sadness and resentment for bringing them into our lives, her getting attached and now me wanting them gone. She felt I was being flakey and said I struggle with commitment. So I walked it back with the condition that wife would do more cleaning up after them. I haven\u2019t seen that happen. \n\nI understand how it would hurt my wife to give them up but all I see are upsides with less mess, more money in the budget, more space with their cat stuff gone. AITA for prioritising those things over her joy and love for the cats?\n\nEdit: took out costs I initially put in along with interventions to illustrate the decision wasn\u2019t being made lightly.", "created_utc": 1675353370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rt60j/aita_for_wanting_to_rehome_our_3_cats_my_wifes/", "score": 3714, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't get pets if you are going to get rid of them, even to a good home. Now they are attached to you, your wife, and each other and you just want to get rid of them and possibly separate them.

Our cat pees and poops outside her box if we don't replace it every year. \n\nHow many boxes do you have? 3 cats is too much for 1 box. You probably need at least 2. \n\nWhen did you move?

There are solutions out there between letting them destroy and dumping them off to someone else.\n\nEdit to add: \nI know the math is 1 box per cat plus 1 extra.

If you wanted a cuddly cat, you should have gone to the shelter and paid $30 for an adult cat and had your pick from the cuddly ones. Shelter staff are knowledgeable in pairing you with the right cat(cuddly and properly litter box trained). You wanted an asthetic, and now that asthetic is inconvenient to you, so you want to sell it. Your wife didn't want cats, but YOU did, so yall got cats. Now your wife wants to keep the cats she's become atatchted to, but YOU don't.

Then your wife becomes attached to said cats and you decide you want to backtrack on your commitment to have these cats.

Come on, it's common sense!\n\nIt seems you haven't thought through what a commitment a pet is.", "YTA - you wanted cats, you got \u2018em, and everything that comes with them. Having three cats is like that: lots of litter, shedding, piss and shit, hairballs and vomit. Did you think it would somehow be different? Taking care of animals is work. Your wife is completely justified in feeling the way she does; this was your idea and now you don\u2019t want to do the work.

Cats aren't toys you can throw away when they're no longer fun. Cats shed hair, vomit and break things what a groundbreaking news. \n\nAdopting three cats at once when neither of you had any experience was probably not the brightest idea.

Cant agree with the rest.", "YTA. We got a cat, she was a moggy (of no main breed) and we quickly discovered I was not good with her fur, runny nose, blocked nose, coughing etc. we saw she was lonely so we got her a friend. We went for a bengal because the fur was meant to be better. Not that I noticed. They both lived to a ripe old age and we never once thought about getting rid of them.

Keep pushing that angle.  Try deciding on one or two clear chores (say, litter and the cleaning for a certain share of the rooms) to solidly, clearly agree on as her new responsibilities.  It'll be easier for her to take them on if she knows EXACTLY what's her job now.  Be prepared to do reminders, as these just haven't been part of wife's habits in the past and it will be hard to adapt to for a bit.\n\nOne trick is to start by doing the chores semi-together; you finish an activity together like watching a movie or something, and then be the first to suggest what to do next as that down time settles in; \"welp, wanna take care of the cats?  I'm gonna go clean up the kitchen, and the litterbox needs to be cleaned so you could do that.  Then we can regroup and do [xyz more fun activity.]\"", "YTA--- First of all, why get designer cats from a breeder??????? Adopting would have been more ethical.

I also have three cats (and two dogs) so I'm no stranger to how obnoxious the shedding, etc is. But all of these things have solutions and should've been things you were prepared for.\n\nIf you can spend that much on cats buy a robotic vacuum to do the daily clean which will cut down on hair everywhere. Provide your cats with scratching posts/spots and you can buy sprays to keep them from scratching furniture or buy those little nail covers. If they're having constant hairballs there are supplements you can get to reduce that (and they're not very expensive; I've had good luck with Cat Lax). Hell, you can buy automatic litterboxes now!  Change the type of litter to one that tracks less (maybe those pellets?). \n\nI'd also suggest playing more with them if you aren't already. That can help get their energy levels down and maybe help you bond with them more.", "YTA.\n\nDon't ever have children.  You are not supposed to get pets (cats, dogs, fish, snakes, whatever) if you aren't going to keep them forever.

Prior to us being together she was very anti-pets, zero interest. I\u2019d always wanted a cat. We talked and with heavy persuasion from me, ended up getting a Bengal from a breeder (~$800). She turned out to be very skittish, so we got her a Bengal sibling(~$1k) to maybe help. Neither of them are super cuddly so we added a calico($200) who is. All of these were joint decisions. Wife feeds them, I do litter box, water, meds, and google solutions to any issues that come up.\n\nWe just bought a house and I do most of the cleaning: vacuuming, dusting, tubs, laundry, etc. This was the case when I worked but more so since I\u2019ve been unemployed for 4 months. \n\nI\u2019ve felt discontent with the cats since we moved because I have to clean constantly to stay on top of the shed hair, the food mess, the litter tracked everywhere. They randomly throw up on rugs and pooped on the hardwood floor(vet visit showed nothing wrong). They\u2019ve ripped out the bottoms of a new sofa set and scratched up the other. And wife frets about the cats being sad when we go out of town, even though my sister watches them for free each time.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019m over them and want to rehome them responsibly. The first alone and the last 2 together. I\u2019ve mentioned it before and was met with sadness and resentment for bringing them into our lives, her getting attached and now me wanting them gone. She felt I was being flakey and said I struggle with commitment. So I walked it back with the condition that wife would do more cleaning up after them. I haven\u2019t seen that happen. \n\nI understand how it would hurt my wife to give them up but all I see are upsides with less mess, more money in the budget, more space with their cat stuff gone. AITA for prioritising those things over her joy and love for the cats?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA, and clearly didn't do your research. Bengals are notoriously difficult cats because they are closer to wild than other, older breeds. They are highly destructive, and it's hit or miss if they're skittish but are rarely exceptionally friendly towards humans. You would have been much better off with either a mixed breed cat or a more laid-back breed. It sounds like you are one of many owners who got caught up in the hype of a specific breed of animal.\n\nI also think it's weird that you're only discontented with them since you moved. It's unlikely that behavior has just started, so what is different now?\n\nBuy a roomba. If you can afford $800-1000 per cat to get a pure bred, I assume you have the $250 or so for one. Scoop the litter regularly, and make sure thar since you have 3 cats, you have 4-5 litter boxes. There should be at least 2 per floor of your house, and 3 would be better. If the bathroom issues have just started its very likely they're fighting over too few boxes. Even cats who like each other can be territorial about the box.\n\nIf the issue is about the actual cats, then yeah, you should re-home them for their sakes. If it's about the issues you've mentioned, then find solutions. You're the asshole either way for getting a bunch of expensive pure bred cats with no research and then dumping them somewhere, but at least they'll have what they need and someone who loves them.", "YTA why did you not investigate about the breed you were taking in? Probably you wanted a cat that look cool and with a wild look. Bengals are high energy cats and have a distinctive meow. Also because of their high energy they are prone, like dogs with high energy, to do bigger messes than normal animals because they are bored. Please get this to your head before getting a pet: A pet is a live commitment so investigate before getting one! I lost to my job once and had to endure will getting another one. But I am  always prepare for rainy days like that so I don't have to put my pets on adoption.", "I'm over them..what a huge AH you are..please do not EVER EVER get another pet again AH", "YTA. You go out of your way to suggest cats, you buy designer breed cats for 2k which is fucking absurd, live with them for 3 years and want to ditch them bc you need to do basic cat upkeep? While unemployed and just being a house husband? Your wife is right, you're flaky, and she's probably already considering what life's going to be like going forward. Are you going to have kids and lose interest in them after a few years? Are you going to lose interest in her after a few years? You're in some deep shit OP", "YTA for spending thousands on cats without apparently researching their temperament AT ALL", "YTA bengals are not just \u201chouse cats\u201d. You need to actually supply them with shit to do, or your couch is 100% forfeit to their trapped boredom caused by YOU.", "YTA for not training and engaging with your cats. Bengals are high energy cats and these cats need play!! Have you trained them for walks? Did you buy a wheel to run in? Do you play with them? That's why they're destroying your furniture!! And if they're pooping in the wrong spot, it's a behavior issue - do they all get along? Are any stressed? Do u keep the litter boxes empty?  Cats. Are. Not. Accessories.  They're not low maintenance creatures that just do their own thing and give affection with zero engagement from their owners. They take training and effort!", "Oh boy, as someone with two Bengals, this makes me so sad.\n\nFirst, try to get a Litter Robot. I know they\u2019re expensive, but my litter cost was so high before that in less than a year, I\u2019ll be ahead on the cost. It has made it so much more enjoyable owning the cats. Their litter trapping mat is great and I just vacuum around it once a day and we\u2019re good.\n\nSecond, at that price point, I fear your Bengal breeder may not have been the most\u2026 legit. How old were they when you got them? They require extra love and attention, especially if they were separated too soon. They\u2019re also a busy breed in general though. What\u2019s your play schedule like with them?\n\nYTA though, because you knew all these things before getting cats. Certainly by the time you got the second and third. Let me tell you though, Bengals can be the most loving, wonderful power you\u2019ve ever had. They just need extra TLC \ud83e\udd70\n\nETA: pet not power, iPhones \ud83d\ude44", "I'm on the fence here.  On one hand, yta for getting pets you were not prepared to care for. On the other hand, I can see rehoming them as a good option before they start getting neglected.  \n\nBut this is definitely a conversation to have with your wife.   Explain to her your concerns/feelings.  You guys comitted to getting the cats together, and if you chose to rehome them, then that's a decision that needs to made together as well.", "I have a tabby(m) torbie(f) bonded siblings that are almost 2 which are rescues, and an almost 1yr old Bengal (f). 3 cats are a lot of work for one person so I don't want to say YTA for wanting more help from your partner. \n\nMine can be especially demanding of attention(even tho they get tons). I did have some potty issues with my male initially but I try my best to let them have supervised yard time for at least 30mins usually an hour a day. I also have a [ferris cat wheel](https://www.ziggydoo.com/en/home/8-ferris-cat-exercise-wheel.html) which is extremely helpful, especially with high-energy breeds like the Bengal. I also have bird feeders in my backyard so they can get stimulation from the wild birds, window seats, tons of toys, and lots of parkour cat furniture on the walls in addition to shelvestowers. The combination of all this has kept my couches and furniture quite safe and has eliminated the potty issues my male had.\n\nAs I said I don't want to say YTA for wanting more help from your spouse because imo being a stay-at-home fur parent is similar to being a SAHP in the sense that a working spouse should provide more support once they're home from work, because it's not like you're doing nothing all day.\nnor do I want to say you're being one for wanting to responsibly rehome them when you've realized it's becoming too much for you to handle alone.\n\nI'd lean towards saying YTA because this is stuff I thought of being a possibility when I decided to get my cats. I think these are scenarios a lot of people need to consider when deciding to get any amount of fur babies, and they need to be willing to give them their best possible life. I think there are way too many people who rush into wanting an awesome companion animal, and a lot of people who want cats want a cuddle bug but every cat has a different personality. \n\nSo many skittish cats with very slight behavioral issues get rehomed too early when there are simple solutions to most of them. My torbie is extremely skittish I think she was the bullied one in the litter and they were rescued from a bathroom wall absent a mother. On her terms tho she'll come up to me and paw to get under my blanket or plop down on me while I'm getting ready to bed and in those moments my heart just melts and it makes all the hurdles and cleaning worthwhile. It can sometimes take years for a skittish cat to reach that stage and sometimes they never do.\n\nTLDR: your NTA for wanting to responsibly rehome the cat, your NTA for wanting more help, but in my opinion YTA for not factoring in all of this and then making a fully informed decision before getting the cats. I also think that since it was a joint decision to get them all then it 1000% needs to be a joint decision to rehome them. If either party is uncomfortable with that then they need to live with their original decision.", "It\u2019s so frustrating seeing people who act like you with pets. You took in THREE freaking cats.

Like is it foam?  Is it liquid?  Is it digested food?  Is it food that looks completely formed but was thrown up in a little disc thing?  Or is it like hairballs?  Does the calico have long hair?  What kind of food do you usually use?\n\nHow many boxes do you have?  What kind of litter are you using?  We switched from a clumping clay to a crystally looking kind that I can't think what it's called, but I can look!  It has made a huge difference with it being everywhere.  I mean it's still around the boxes, but mostly gets caught with the litter pads.  It doesn't stick to fur and get dragged through the house anymore though!  \n\nWhile right now I'd say E.S.H. I think a lot of this just sounds like cats and has some simple fixes.  She should also help.  Maybe sweeping the litter area every few days.  I don't think she's wrong that you pressed hard for these cats and now that you're having to be responsible, you're having commitment issues with it.

It's a pity that the Instagram influencers who have them can't understand that, most of them see photos of someone enjoying a walk outdoors with their adult Saint Bernard and they forget the part where they will need a dog school, a specific vaccination schedule , set rules for strangers who approach you at the dog park , constantly clean and rearrange your house , adopt him (or pay a lot of money) and then end up giving him away or taking him to an animal shelter , and that's if they're feeling kind .", "Unless op got the cats from a backyard breeder or Mill  for cheap which I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s the case because clearly op didn\u2019t do an ounce of research.", "I have a half ragdoll (her mama was a retired breeding queen RAVAGED by a black Tom during covid confusion) and she is the sweetest little pop.

Luckily I live very close a hospital.

I have two sweethearts, and the younger one is incredibly smart and easily bored.

There was absolutely no consoling my cat for several days.\n\nShe just faceplanted herself in a box of my stuff and refused to move or be moved.  We tired everything, she just needed her own space and time.  Got pretty worried towards the end though because she hadn\u2019t been eating or drinking really.\n\nThought we\u2019d done well - she was the last thing to go, so she was always with us.  Wrapped her up in her favorite blanket and held her for the short car ride across town.  Had a whole spot in the little dressing room set up for her with her favorite things, treats, and several pieces of my own clothing.\n\nNope, straight for box of books to bury herself in.\n\nThankfully she came out okay, but I do dread knowing I will have to move again eventually.", "This.
