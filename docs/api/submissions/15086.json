I have a better job than her, she makes a bit above minimum wage. After the first few dates in which we share the bill, I started paying for dinner/ entertainment when we go out. I don't mind it really I know she struggles with money sometimes. \n\nHowever this week my brother asked me to lean him some money because his car broke down and he gets paid monthly, he will give me the money back when he gets paid. As I get paid every two weeks I had some extra money so I lean it to him. I'm doing good on money until I get paid again, however now I don't have lots of money to spend on dates for now. My girlfriend knows about this. \n\nMy girlfriend invited me to see a movie and then have dinner. I paid for the movie tickets and snacks. After the movie my girlfriend picked a restaurant and we had dinner there, when the bill came I asked her to pay because I had already spend my money in the movie, I didn't had enough to pay for dinner too. She did, but she was upset. When we got into my car she asked what happened and why I couldn't pay. I told her about my brother's car again. She said that she had forgotten about it, then said I know she struggles with money and I shouldn't have let her pick a expensive restaurant if I wanted her to pay. I dropped her at her house and she hasn't been answering my texts since.

That said, you have been paying for entire dates several times, so it should be okay for her to pay for PART of the date once. From your post, it came across as though she sees your money as free money to indulge in.

I would say NTA, but you two might need to talk a bit more with each other.", "NTA. You're dating a childish leech.", "NTA. You were invited out, not the other way around.", "ESH.\n\nShe should not be automatically expecting you to pay, but if you have reinforced this expectation and now you are changing it, you shouldn't be dropping it on her AFTER the bill has arrived.", "NTA let\u2019s get this straight, SHE picked an expensive restaurant, assuming you were going to pay and when you couldn\u2019t and she had to, she got mad. Don\u2019t you think an adult should have and be willing to pay atleast their half of the bill when THEY voluntarily pick a place. It is kind of a bummer that you also didn\u2019t mention that you weren\u2019t going to pay, since you normally seem to every time. It is also understandable that it might have caught her off guard, but being mad about it is just entitlement.", "Sounds like you\u2019re her cash cow and she\u2019s not willing to support you back, or be considerate of how her actions impact you.

Your girlfriend because it sounds like she's become accustomed to you footing the bill and as such, picked an expensive restaurant without asking you first. You, because upon seeing the expensive restaurant should have advised her that you wouldn't be able to contribute to the bill before you went in.\n\nI'd have a sit down and discuss the relationship being more 50/50. It's understandable that you would offer to pay for more things given the higher wage, but even a cheap meal on her side would level the playing field.", "ESH.

It's great that you pay for most and you don't mind doing it because you earn more, but her reasoning makes her sound entitled.", "ESH\n\nYou obviously should have told your girlfriend before she picked a restaurant that she would have to pay if she wanted to eat there. But I also think it\u2019s not cool of her to expect you to pay for movies, snacks and an expensive dinner like that either imo these things should be split always.

If you expected her to pay for dinner maybe she would have been more comfortable making you dinner at home or chosen a less expensive restaurant.  She also should chip in.

Agreed, you had a bad week this week, but it wasn\u2019t fair for you to wait until after the meal was over to ask your GF to pick up the check. Like she said - you know her financial situation, so you should have let her know what you expected before y\u2019all selected the restaurant so she could have made an informed choice. And it was reasonable for her to assume you would pay because of your history. \n\nWhen you get your next paycheck, some flowers might be a wise investment.", "YTA, should have discussed this earlier", "NTA. If you always pay like you say, she should\u2019ve coughed up the money without batting an eye. This is a good thing to get out of the way EARLY in a relationship though.", "NTA. You \"shouldn't have let her pick an expensive restaurant\" made me chuckle a bit. She got used to you covering the bill so she is easily picking places which she can't normally afford. That is a bit overindulging.", "now I'm not saying she a gold digger but she ain't messing with no broke folk  \nBut seriously she invited OP out and picked an expensive restaurant and still expected him to pay fully knowing he did not have any extra money   \nPlus the fact that she is not texting OP to me shows that she was only with him for what he was doing not who he was", "ESH - Maybe should have brought it up again that money was tight before deciding on dinner after the Movie", "You're both pretty young and still learning about life and relationships. It would have been a kindness for you to bring up beforehand that money was tight for you this week, and you would only be able to spend X amount, so she could have picked a less expensive place or decided to skip dinner. This would have prevented the awkwardness that ended up happening. \n\n\nBut... you also need to have a talk about financial expectations in this relationship. If you're comfortable with footing the bill for every date, fine, but she shouldn't presume or feel entitled to that. And really, she can treat you sometimes too. Even if it's just ice cream or something like that every so often. It's a sign that she's invested and that she cares about you. \n\n\nNAH, but communication is needed. Best of luck.", "ESH\n\nYou all suck at managing money if you can\u2019t discuss the cost of a date beforehand and if you are all living pay check to pay check with no security buffer (less so GF since she\u2019s on minimum wage and probably doesn\u2019t have much choice- but then she shouldn\u2019t choose expensive restaurants). Your brother included.", "ESH.\n\nShe's wrong for assuming that you'll always pay, you're wrong for having sprung it on her when the check arrived rather than ahead of time.  \"I'd love to take you out for dinner, but money is tight this month.\"", "YTA: communicate, communicate, communicate. You say that going to a restaurant, not when they are presenting the bill.", "NTA and girl just proved that her main interest in you is your wallet mate.", "NTA - The end of dinner wasn\u2019t the time to discuss who was paying for it though. You must have known she couldn\u2019t pay for an expensive place so who did you think was going to pay?\n\nIt\u2019s wrong of her to expect you to pay all the time but you got yourselves into a pattern where you do, so if you are going to change that, you need to warn her so she can budget.\n\nThat said I would be changing that pattern to something more equitable if I were you. It doesn\u2019t have to be expensive but she needs to pay for dates too.", "NTA.\nBut you're enabling user behaviour, and coddling her (budding?) entitlement. Eventually you might get disgruntled when she crosses the line too many times, and she'll think you an AH for not providing what she's used to. And by then it'll be too late to backtrack.", "NTA So it is fine to pick an expensive restaurant when you pay? You pay the dates for months(!) and she needed to pay half a date one fucking time and makes drama. This should worry you! She clearly expect you to pay everything. You are the ATM. And don't you dare to not have the money than she punishes you with silent-treatment like know. Or she just ghosted you because she thought you had more money?", "NTA, she also invited you and picked out the restaurant so I think it was perfectly acceptable for her to pay. I firmly believe it\u2019s good to treat your man once in a while too.", "Seems she didn't have a problem picking an expensive restaurant when she thought you would be paying. \n\nBe happy and stop texting her.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n>She said that she had forgotten about it, then said I know she struggles with money and I shouldn't have let her pick a expensive restaurant if I wanted her to pay.\n\nSeriously?!  So she picks a pricey place when you're paying, but goes cheap when she has to pay...sounds exhausting. Do you really want to to support her ALL THE TIME?!", "Going with ESH. She shouldn't have assumed you'd pay since she knew about your loan to your brother. I also think you should have asked her what her budget looked like before picking a place to eat and reminded her that it wasn't you paying. I think it boils down to a lack of communication.", "ESH.  Just use your words.\n\nYou know money is tight for her.  She (theoretically) knows money is tight for you right now.\n\n\u201cHey babe, wanna do dinner and a movie?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, but I know you\u2019re tight on money and remember I loaned that money to my bro?

Of course she got upset. You basically paid for months and without saying a word to her, allowed her to pick a restaurant that wasn\u2019t in her budget knowing FULL WELL that when she chose it she thought you would be paying (Because\u2026 you PAID FOR ALL THE OTHER DATES). YTA big time. I hope she leaves you.", "Very soft ESH.\n\nI mean you have created the precedent that you will pay and so it was natural for her to expect that going forward.\n\nAt the same time she needs to understand this was hardly intentional.\n\nVery soft - because this like such a baby fight in what seems like a great relationship.", "YTA for not telling her in advance if you know that she struggles, and generally pay for things", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But now and then he does splurge and we go on a date that is more expensive. And when we\u2019ve been strapped for funds (student loan payoff etc), we come up with low-cost alternatives for dates (cooking at home, going on hikes, etc).

If you don't want to spend money on dates there's other options, but you have to communicate that.

She may have to choose between gas to get to work and food until she gets paid again. That one dinner may have set her way behind financially.

No. OP was vague. \n\nThen days later GF invited OP to a movie and dinner, something they probably do quite a bit, and OP always pays. OP didn\u2019t say anything other than yes let\u2019s go out.

The opposite example being the entire paragraph that you ignored.", ">Maybe because he pays for everything, she thought he could just afford that as well. \n\nFrom the OP:\n\n> However this week my brother asked me to lean him some money because his car broke down and he gets paid monthly, he will give me the money back when he gets paid. As I get paid every two weeks I had some extra money so I lean it to him. I'm doing good on money until I get paid again, however **now I don't have lots of money to spend on dates for now. My girlfriend knows about this.**\n\n>I cant imagine dropping a bill like that onto somebody i know wasnt expecting it\n\nYou mean like how she expected him to pay despite him letting her know he doesn't have much money to spend on dates?\n\n>I had spent 1000s of dollars on Paul over the previous 5 years, and now he won't buy me a drink? That is how somebody you spend money on becomes an asshole.\n\nThis is almost a *straight* comparison to the OP other than being a shorter timeline, but for some reason Paul is an asshole, but OP's girlfriend isn't.", "Right? A simple response to her suggesting that particular restaurant and there wouldn't have been an issue.\n\nObviously it's an 'ESH,' but lol at the incels in this thread.", "Oh, no. Him paying for shit would mean that their relationship is equal, since he does something and she does something.\n\nIn this example, both work, but only she does housework and childcare. But she\u2019s been brainwashed into thinking that it\u2019s a \u201cwoman\u2019s job\u201d so she doesn\u2019t complain.", "Breaking up with someone because they're not doing their share is one thing. Sticking someone with a bill you know they can't afford is another.", "They're so mad lmao", "Obviously, she can, since she did.\n\n*He* can\u2019t, which is what he clearly communicated to her. She still proceeded to invite him out on a layered date that she not only expected him to pay, but she also made sure it was an expensive restaurant.", "\"She shouldn't be doing that, but you should have let her do that\". What kind of logic is this? Lol", "Right I often find myself doing the opposite, in these kind of situations.", "Yeah, I'm guessing she thought he'd pay for the date then deal with being broke until the brother paid him back. She wasn't expecting \"strapped for cash\" to mean \"I literally don't have the money to pay this bill after buying our tickets and popcorn, can you get it this time? \"", "My toxic trait is believing everyone should be like me and get the cheapest thing possible when someone else is paying for me.", "Someone paying for you should never be an expectation.", "even when i know a friend is paying, and they have good jobs, i always try to order something reasonable and not try to take advantage of a free dinner", "Default calling a woman a gold digger despite OP OFFERING to fit the bill every time before AND us not knowing if this restaurant was atypical for them is sexist. Guess I'll die on that hill but I'm tired of people always whinging about misandry in this sub when it tends to be biased against women more often than not", "She literally said if she knew she'd have to pay then she would have chosen differently. That says it all right there and OP says she makes less than him and struggles with money. He very clearly states that he isn't trying to paint anything LMAO.", "Not to mention there are reasons why people might be uncomfortable owning a CC - being bad with tracking money/repayments comes to mind, also being uncomfortable spending money you don't actually have. I'm in Australia and below the poverty line so maybe it's different but I don't know anyone who even has a CC. \n\nOP is NTA, but I feel like their communication as a couple could be better.", "Lmao. I love how desperate you are to paint him in a bad light for deciding she should pay after she asked him out on a date even though he said he was short on money, but you also think it\u2019s perfectly normal that she assumed he would pay, regardless of how much money it would cost, y\u2019know, since she picked an expensive restaurant.", "He also knew she didn't have much money, and he expected her to pay. In the end, she paid. How does that make her the bigger asshole?", "If she did all the housework, and she found that unfair, I would say she should talk to him. If she instead hired a cleaning service with his credit card, that would be an asshole move. If the cost was comparable to this (probably not, but as a hypothetical) that would be equally assholish.", "He expected her to pay because she invited him out after learning he\u2019s penniless AND chose an expensive restaurant. If he paid for numerous dates, she can pay for one, or she can sit her entitled ass at home. \n\nShe paid in the end because he literally had no money? Somebody had to. Obviously, she had more than she let him think.", "What if she worked, did housework and childcare while he just worked and enjoyed his free time and she thought it was normal because, y\u2019know, gender roles teach us that women should do household chores and childcare, but they should also work too since men can\u2019t earn enough to support the entire household anymore. Would you be supporting the husband who gets angry if the wife asks him *once* to wash the dishes or change a diaper?", "He still agreed to go on the date without telling her she would have to pay.\n\n\nThe difference between Paul and the GF is that Paul could afford what I asked him to buy.", ">He expected her to pay because she invited him out\n\nThat was apparently not how they did thinks their entire relationship, so he needed to communicate this is different.\n\n>he\u2019s penniless\n\nHe's not penniless.\n\n>she can pay for one, or she can sit her entitled ass at home.\n\nHe didn't give her that option\n\n>Obviously, she had more than she let him think.\n\nJust because her card cleared or she had cash doesn't mean she has lots of money. Can she pay all her bills after paying for the date, or is it going on a credit card that she can't afford to pay off?", ">Would you be supporting the husband who gets angry if the wife asks him once to wash the dishes or change a diaper?\n\nThat's communication. If OP had said before going to they restaurant, I can't afford it, can you cover it? That would also be communication. Sticking her with the bill is not communication. I noticed you ignored my metaphor about sticking him with the bill for the house keeper without a discussion, would that be cool in your eyes?", "Not sure entitled, probably immature, hasn\u2019t experienced this situation before and hasn\u2019t experienced a serious relationship with sharing.  She\u2019s still in the wrong", "She just wanted a free dinner.", "And chose an expensive restaurant because he was supposed to pay.", "If it is not her responsibility to remember his finances, then why is it his responsibility to remember hers? \n\nI think OP is NTA.", "It's petty but uh, the \"M\" in ATM actually stands for machine so you just said \"Automatic Tella Machine Machine\" lol.\n\nAny way I agree with everything you said. She definitely sees him as an ATM. NTA.", "Yep, OP was a meal ticket that was all.", "Maybe it's neither's responsibility. But, it's clear from his post that he knew she'd have a hard time paying, she wasn't offering and she had assumed he could. Sure, maybe she should've offered to pay somewhere she could afford. Maybe he was mad that she didn't. But instead of saying that, he set her up to have to pay for his meal when she wasn't expecting and hadn't budgeted for it.\n\nAs I said in other comments, the short version is that both of them went to a restaurant neither could afford expecting the other to pay. The one who did pay is not the asshole.", "Yea people who think like this are definitely part of the problem.", "I think that the one who pays graciously time and time again is NTA when, during a temporary hardship, they expect their partner to take a turn. \n\nI don\u2019t think he set her up when he paid for both the movie and the snacks.", "Yes, I believe in equality, I don't make up for it with sex. I'm older, this is an expected dynamic in my age group. My point was, even then you don't treat the other person like a bottomless pit of money.", "He set her up because he didn't tell her. He didn't give her a chance to plan a date she could afford. It would've been perfectly reasonable for him to have asked, but sticking her with the check with no warning was not cool.", "For someone who typically has lots of money, not having lots of money **is** struggling.", "She was going to have stuck him, by that math, with movie tickets, snacks, and an expensive dinner on top of snacks. If she does that regularly, that seems not cool. \n\nEspecially if she does not seem to care enough about what is going on in his life to remember that he is going through that temporary financial hardship. \n\nAnd if she did remember that and just did not care that is not cool either. Because as you said - she planned a date she could not afford. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I would have asked in that scenario, and not from any malice. I just would have assumed that my boyfriend or girlfriend would have my back and help out if I was in a pinch. Especially if I usually have theirs. Especially if I\u2019d already bought the movie tickets. And the snacks.", "Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger\nBut she ain't messin' with no broke - broke", "Never pick a restaurant you aren't willing to pay for our of your own pocket", "You mean Teller, not Tella", "Not only that but using OP to eat at more expensive restaurants that girlfriend would eat at. Even back when I was on the dating scene I never picked a restaurant I couldn't afford...just in case.", "Pathetic lol", "Struck a nerve huh", "Maybe cos he thought she was paying? For once?", "And she certainly thought to herself \"well if I knew I had to pay I certainly would not have invited you\"", "on AITA the bf is always an ah /s", "All the people who voted YTA are leeches and takers", "Interesting.  I also am older.  I believe differently to you.", "I mean, no? Lol I'm just bored on Reddit and you keep responding. Hope you have the day you deserve, peace.", "Well it's been pretty good so far, so I guess I did, thanks man"]}
