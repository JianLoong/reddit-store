I have a better job than her, she makes a bit above minimum wage. After the first few dates in which we share the bill, I started paying for dinner/ entertainment when we go out. I don't mind it really I know she struggles with money sometimes. \n\nHowever this week my brother asked me to lean him some money because his car broke down and he gets paid monthly, he will give me the money back when he gets paid. As I get paid every two weeks I had some extra money so I lean it to him. I'm doing good on money until I get paid again, however now I don't have lots of money to spend on dates for now. My girlfriend knows about this. \n\nMy girlfriend invited me to see a movie and then have dinner. I paid for the movie tickets and snacks. After the movie my girlfriend picked a restaurant and we had dinner there, when the bill came I asked her to pay because I had already spend my money in the movie, I didn't had enough to pay for dinner too. She did, but she was upset. When we got into my car she asked what happened and why I couldn't pay. I told her about my brother's car again. She said that she had forgotten about it, then said I know she struggles with money and I shouldn't have let her pick a expensive restaurant if I wanted her to pay.

That said, you have been paying for entire dates several times, so it should be okay for her to pay for PART of the date once. From your post, it came across as though she sees your money as free money to indulge in.

I'd say bullet dodged - avoid this person. NTA", "NTA, she's so entitled. She CHOSE the restaurant, an expensive restaurant, thinking that you'd pay.

You might want to rethink your relationship if you ever desire a true 50/50.", "NTA, but you should've made it clear that you couldn't afford to pay before you went for the meal.\n\nShe absolutely shouldn't be expecting you to pay for everything though, and to me personally, it's VERY interesting that she was upset that she had to pay for dinner with her boyfriend ONCE.", "NTA She takes your money for granted, so you should talk to her and establish a budget for yours dates so both of you can pay without issues.", "Would have been nice to tell her beforehand. Also would have been nice to not forget your new financial situation an just assume you will always pay for expensive restaurants. I would say NTA, but you two might need to talk a bit more with each other.", "NTA. You're dating a childish leech.", "NTA. You were invited out, not the other way around.", "ESH.\n\nShe should not be automatically expecting you to pay, but if you have reinforced this expectation and now you are changing it, you shouldn't be dropping it on her AFTER the bill has arrived.", "NTA let\u2019s get this straight, SHE picked an expensive restaurant, assuming you were going to pay and when you couldn\u2019t and she had to, she got mad. Don\u2019t you think an adult should have and be willing to pay atleast their half of the bill when THEY voluntarily pick a place. It is kind of a bummer that you also didn\u2019t mention that you weren\u2019t going to pay, since you normally seem to every time. It is also understandable that it might have caught her off guard, but being mad about it is just entitlement.", "Sounds like you\u2019re her cash cow and she\u2019s not willing to support you back, or be considerate of how her actions impact you.

She needs to be ok with spending _her_ money as well.", "NTA, although it would have been more considerate on your part to have discussed beforehand what she was paying. You both knew one another's financial situations were tight, but the factor that lends this toward N TA is that you went from splitting the difference to you paying everything--it doesn't sound like she's ever had a time of pulling her weight in this, and on top of it, wants to eat extravagantly when it's your money but not hers.", "ESH, it is generally considered a good idea to discuss who is paying for what before the date, not to expect the other to pay and make requests when the bill comes.", "I'm gonna go with a light ESH. Your girlfriend because it sounds like she's become accustomed to you footing the bill and as such, picked an expensive restaurant without asking you first. You, because upon seeing the expensive restaurant should have advised her that you wouldn't be able to contribute to the bill before you went in.\n\nI'd have a sit down and discuss the relationship being more 50/50. It's understandable that you would offer to pay for more things given the higher wage, but even a cheap meal on her side would level the playing field.", "ESH.  She shouldnt be relying on you to pay, but you shouldnt have presented her with the bill as a fait acompli.  Sort these things out before you go out again, if you do.", "Dump her.

It's great that you pay for most and you don't mind doing it because you earn more, but her reasoning makes her sound entitled.", "ESH\n\nYou obviously should have told your girlfriend before she picked a restaurant that she would have to pay if she wanted to eat there. But I also think it\u2019s not cool of her to expect you to pay for movies, snacks and an expensive dinner like that either imo these things should be split always.

YTA to yourself if you ignore this red flag", "ESH you should have told her before the date what you could afford.  If you expected her to pay for dinner maybe she would have been more comfortable making you dinner at home or chosen a less expensive restaurant.  She also should chip in.  It doesn\u2019t have to be equal it could be cheaper options but it would show you more respect.", "ESH. Agreed, you had a bad week this week, but it wasn\u2019t fair for you to wait until after the meal was over to ask your GF to pick up the check. Like she said - you know her financial situation, so you should have let her know what you expected before y\u2019all selected the restaurant so she could have made an informed choice. And it was reasonable for her to assume you would pay because of your history. \n\nWhen you get your next paycheck, some flowers might be a wise investment.", "YTA, should have discussed this earlier", "NTA. If you always pay like you say, she should\u2019ve coughed up the money without batting an eye. This is a good thing to get out of the way EARLY in a relationship though.", "NTA. You \"shouldn't have let her pick an expensive restaurant\" made me chuckle a bit. She got used to you covering the bill so she is easily picking places which she can't normally afford. That is a bit overindulging.", "now I'm not saying she a gold digger but she ain't messing with no broke folk  \nBut seriously she invited OP out and picked an expensive restaurant and still expected him to pay fully knowing he did not have any extra money   \nPlus the fact that she is not texting OP to me shows that she was only with him for what he was doing not who he was", "ESH - Maybe should have brought it up again that money was tight before deciding on dinner after the Movie", "You're both pretty young and still learning about life and relationships. It would have been a kindness for you to bring up beforehand that money was tight for you this week, and you would only be able to spend X amount, so she could have picked a less expensive place or decided to skip dinner. This would have prevented the awkwardness that ended up happening. \n\n\nBut... you also need to have a talk about financial expectations in this relationship. If you're comfortable with footing the bill for every date, fine, but she shouldn't presume or feel entitled to that. And really, she can treat you sometimes too. Even if it's just ice cream or something like that every so often. It's a sign that she's invested and that she cares about you. \n\n\nNAH, but communication is needed. Best of luck.", "ESH\n\nYou all suck at managing money if you can\u2019t discuss the cost of a date beforehand and if you are all living pay check to pay check with no security buffer (less so GF since she\u2019s on minimum wage and probably doesn\u2019t have much choice- but then she shouldn\u2019t choose expensive restaurants). Your brother included.", "ESH.\n\nShe's wrong for assuming that you'll always pay, you're wrong for having sprung it on her when the check arrived rather than ahead of time.  \"I'd love to take you out for dinner, but money is tight this month.\"", "YTA: communicate, communicate, communicate. You say that going to a restaurant, not when they are presenting the bill.", "NTA and girl just proved that her main interest in you is your wallet mate.", "NTA - The end of dinner wasn\u2019t the time to discuss who was paying for it though. You must have known she couldn\u2019t pay for an expensive place so who did you think was going to pay?\n\nIt\u2019s wrong of her to expect you to pay all the time but you got yourselves into a pattern where you do, so if you are going to change that, you need to warn her so she can budget.\n\nThat said I would be changing that pattern to something more equitable if I were you. It doesn\u2019t have to be expensive but she needs to pay for dates too.", "NTA.\nBut you're enabling user behaviour, and coddling her (budding?) entitlement. Eventually you might get disgruntled when she crosses the line too many times, and she'll think you an AH for not providing what she's used to. And by then it'll be too late to backtrack.", "NTA So it is fine to pick an expensive restaurant when you pay? You pay the dates for months(!) and she needed to pay half a date one fucking time and makes drama. This should worry you! She clearly expect you to pay everything. You are the ATM. And don't you dare to not have the money than she punishes you with silent-treatment like know. Or she just ghosted you because she thought you had more money?", "NTA, she also invited you and picked out the restaurant so I think it was perfectly acceptable for her to pay. I firmly believe it\u2019s good to treat your man once in a while too.", "Seems she didn't have a problem picking an expensive restaurant when she thought you would be paying. \n\nBe happy and stop texting her.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n>She said that she had forgotten about it, then said I know she struggles with money and I shouldn't have let her pick a expensive restaurant if I wanted her to pay.\n\nSeriously?!  So she picks a pricey place when you're paying, but goes cheap when she has to pay...sounds exhausting. Do you really want to to support her ALL THE TIME?!", "Going with ESH. She shouldn't have assumed you'd pay since she knew about your loan to your brother. I also think you should have asked her what her budget looked like before picking a place to eat and reminded her that it wasn't you paying. I think it boils down to a lack of communication.", "ESH.  Just use your words.\n\nYou know money is tight for her.  She (theoretically) knows money is tight for you right now.\n\n\u201cHey babe, wanna do dinner and a movie?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, but I know you\u2019re tight on money and remember I loaned that money to my bro?  Can we afford to go out?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, good point.  Let\u2019s cook something at home and rent a movie instead!\u201d\n\nWham, bam, done.", "ESH... TALK, TALK things BEFORE.", "YTA. Judge Milian from People\u2019s Court always says that if you continue to do things (like paying for dates) and never act like it\u2019s a problem or never discuss it then it shouldn\u2019t be pikachu face when they get upset when you suddenly can\u2019t pay. Of course she got upset. You basically paid for months and without saying a word to her, allowed her to pick a restaurant that wasn\u2019t in her budget knowing FULL WELL that when she chose it she thought you would be paying (Because\u2026 you PAID FOR ALL THE OTHER DATES). YTA big time. I hope she leaves you.", "Very soft ESH.\n\nI mean you have created the precedent that you will pay and so it was natural for her to expect that going forward.\n\nAt the same time she needs to understand this was hardly intentional.\n\nVery soft - because this like such a baby fight in what seems like a great relationship.", "YTA for not telling her in advance if you know that she struggles, and generally pay for things", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But now and then he does splurge and we go on a date that is more expensive. And when we\u2019ve been strapped for funds (student loan payoff etc), we come up with low-cost alternatives for dates (cooking at home, going on hikes, etc). Dating is about quality time together and altho it\u2019s fun to go somewhere fancy, it\u2019s not necessary on the regular. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to establish a pattern where she expects the royal treatment without reciprocating.

If your reaction to your partner telling you they lend money and dont have lots of it is to extra choose an expensive restaurant.. your the asshole. Especially when you just never expect to pay, lending Money or expensive restaurant aside. Can also be its ESH because OP couldve said he cant pay before the bill comes but sorry you cant just act like almost a golddigger in date Situations and get angry when you have to pay ONE time. After you got told money is tight", "Because he's no better at communicating than she is. \n\"Hey wanna catch dinner and a movie?\" \n\"That'd be great! Money's tight for me ATM as you know, so maybe we could just pay for ourselves or if I pay for the movie you could pay for the dinner?\" \n\nThere, expectations set. GF can either agree with it or reveal her intentions that she expects him to be her meal ticket. Either way, no one is expected to mind read. He could have even said at the point of paying for movie \"this is all I have left, if I pay for this can you pay for dinner?\" Instead he waited until the last possible second which would have made gf feel on the spot. \n\nShould they be paying equally? Yes. Is gf taking financial advantage of him? Possibly. But OP has been paying for her and if he wanted to change that he should have been upfront about it.", "I agreed with you until her behavior after op asked her to pay.\n\nHer behavior in that situation says it all.", "100%. For a while my boyfriend was making a decent amount more than I was. He picked up entertainment/dinners/movies, basically extracurriculars, while I pulled more weight around the house. Now that I have a more similar income I pick up the luxuries when I can, but we still have who pays for what discussions.", "I would still feel the same way.", "That\u2019s how it was with myself and my wife.  When I picked a nice place, it was with the expectation that I\u2019d pay, and whenever my wife picked one, she always picked something she could afford for the two of us (though I generally offered to pay she would pick up the check more times than not).  Of course now that we\u2019re married, she happily chooses nice places and then slides the check over to me. :D", "I feel like we\u2019re missing the part where she invited him to the restaurant, he had the ability to check out the prices and veto it if it was too expensive. And remind her he couldn\u2019t pay.\n\nIt\u2019s likely this is customary in their relationship, where he has allowed her in the past to pick whatever restaurant they\u2019ve wanted to go to and she\u2019s not had to worry about the bill. Maybe \u201centitled\u201d to you, but I think you get what you allow and clearly OP allowed this.", "No he shouldn't have reminded her. She's an adult and responsible for her financial choices. Don't be naive thinking she really forgot.", "And being the gf doesn't inherently mean you never pay for dates.", "except he literally told her he WAS low on money...", "So instead of talking to her and explaining that he felt taken advantage of, he instead waited until there was a big check in front of them and *then* tells her she has to start paying. He knew she couldn't afford it. What bill is she not going to be able to pay this month because he pulled that stunt? \n\nIf he had told her before they went to the restaurant they could've decided something else, and then worked out something more equitable for dates in the future. But now she's probably breaking up with him. He could've just dumped her beforehand, but I guess that wouldn't have gotten him a free meal he couldn't afford.", ">And so is she. If she expects to get paid for, she has to make sure that \"not lots of money\" is enough Money.\n\nNo. It's his finances, that's up to him. He should say when it's too much.\n\nI'm usually the one with money, and the one paying. I don't want people questioning me if I have enough. That's up to me. I'll say if I don't. \n\n>you cant just act like almost a golddigger in date Situations and get angry when you have to pay ONE time.\n\nIf he told her before they went to the restaurant and she got angry, then she'd be a gold digger. But after a check arrives that she can't afford she's suddenly being told she has to pay? That's why she's mad.", "What a ridiculous take. She's his girlfriend not his child, he shouldn't have to treat her like a kid.", "I guess I\u2019m not devious in that way. I like to see the good in people, and she doesn\u2019t necessarily seem evil. She got used to things being a certain way in their relationship. It\u2019s not like she is constantly asking him for money and asking him to pay her bills. Again, it should have been communicated.", "If you invite someone out who you know doesn't have money that's you offering to pay. She should have covered the entire date, movie, snacks, and dinner because she willingly invited him knowing he didn't have the money for dates.", "He shouldn't say when it's too much. She's his girlfriend not his child. She's an adult and should not expect him to pay her way. In what world is it ok that one partner always pays for everything???", "They\u2019re both adults. They should\u2019ve both communicated what the expectations are for paying. He didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t.\n\nShe has an expectation that he would pay based on past behavior. OP has even confirmed in the comments he likes to pay for his gf. Paying for your gf doesn\u2019t make her a child.", "He didn't say he doesn't have any money. He said: \"I'm doing good on money until I get paid again, however now I don't have lots of money to spend on dates for now.\"\n\nWhat is \"lots of money\" to him? It's clearly not nothing, since he paid for the movie. Would the restaurant put him over, or does that just mean they can't have another date like that this week? It's up to him to communicate that.\n\nHe also knows she doesn't have money, because she works for minimum wage. That's why he's been paying for the dates. My spouse has always made less than me, and is now a stay at home parent, but before we were married if they said \"hey, do you want to go out to eat?\" I would know that I'm paying and I would communicate appropriately. If you don't want to spend money on dates there's other options, but you have to communicate that. The only reason not to communicate would be that if he said he couldn't pay beforehand she might have chosen something else, and then he wouldn't have gotten an expensive meal for free. But she's the gold digger even though she paid for the meal when asked.", ">but before we were married if they said \"hey, do you want to go out to eat?\" I would know that I'm paying\n\nThat was a terrible assumption on both of your parts. The simple fact is you should never be going out at all unless your prepared to pay, and she wasn't. Expecting anyone to pay for you at any point in time is self centered and egotistical entitlement.", "She clearly was prepared to pay, since she did. She also might have been just fine paying just her half, but paying for him, too, was too much on her budget. *He's* the one who expected her to pay for him, and she did, even though she couldn't afford it."]}
