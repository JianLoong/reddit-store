When they signed the lease they agreed to the rules. Their violating of the rules is effecting your enjoyment of your apartment.\n\nYou were fair and complained to management. They failed to act and now you're giving one more chance before escalating.\n\nManagement is being dumb. They are going to have problems renting the other apartment and any connected apartments.", "NTA. This is coming from someone who smokes alot of pot. You have now complained 5 times and its in the lease its a non smoking building. Landlords are scummy and will take advantage of you if you don't tell it how it is. You are fully able to break your lease over something like this if nothing is done.", "NTA\n\nYou've tried to politely tell people not to smoke pot, which is strictly not allowed for several reasons at your complex.  Obviously this was ignored.\n\nWhen polite requests are ignored, it's justifiable to start being much more blunt.  Even if it could be perceived as threatening.\n\nYour response would be an AH response --- if you had not given several polite requests before and had them ignored.", "**NTA**\n\nI had the same issue a few years ago, and I know exactly how awful it is. I already suffer from chronic migraine, and I'm housebound from disability so I couldn't get away from it. All my clothes were starting to stink from my neighbour's weed smoke leaking into my home, and my migraines were getting awful. I was near tears a lot of days from the pain.\n\nIf I might make a suggestion? My building management did eventually deal with my neighbours, but it took a while because while our building is smoke-free as well, weed is legal in our city, and the neighbours pushed back hard. In the meantime, to help me cope and get rid of the smell, building management were actually willing to pay for a top-of-the-line air purifier for me!! It made a HUGE difference. Whenever I started smelling that weed stink, I'd turn the air purifier on high near wherever it seemed to be leaking into my apartment (from what we could tell, it was actually coming in through shitty ventilation systems) and it would clear 99% of the smell from the air.\n\nMaybe try working WITH building management (they probably don't want those tenants stinking up their rental apartment walls permanently either), and tell them you're not trying to be a pain, but it's just an untenable situation for you, and would they be willing to buy you a couple of air purifiers until they can deal with those problem tenants? I've found that if the landlords think you're on their side, they are often willing to be a lot more helpful. \n\nEither way, though,d efinitely NTA.", "NTA at all.", "NTA. You have the right to a home where you aren't constantly breathing smoke, since that's what was promised in the lease. I'm sorry for such a miserable situation. I would've left out the profanity in the letter, but I don't think the letter as a whole was over the top since you've brought this up MANY times already and nothing has happened.", "I don't think you're the asshole. You have a right to come home and your place not smell like weed. I think them smoking outside is a little different, while I do still understand your frustration, but inside should not be happening at all. The fact that it is clear in your apartment complex guidelines that there is to be no smoking, it should be enforced. I get that it would be hard to stop everybody from doing it, especially if you aren't sure which one it is exactly, but if this is a contant reoccurring thing then I do believe someone outside the apartment complex should get involved. I don't want your neighbor to get into any serious trouble for this, but some discipline should be done so they just get the memo that they should smoke somewhere else. Hope it works out for you", "NTA. That crap stinks like swamp taint. You've complained multiple times in the past about it, and nothing gets done. I think you should follow through with your threats.", "INFO: Do people smoke tea?", "NTA. But CALL corporate already. Stop trying to reason with people who don't give a shit.", "Nta if you've mentioned it before and nothing changed so I can understand your frustration. I've had the same happen in my bathroom. Unfortunately landlords may not do anything.", "NTA. You\u2019ve notified them multiple times about this being an issue and they\u2019ve done nothing about it. If you\u2019re paying to live in a smoke-free environment, then it should be smoke-free.", "NTA.\n\nThat shit stinks. I used to live above a 90 year old woman that smoked a pack a day. She wasn\u2019t supposed to of course. I was miserable. Felt like the smell was choking me in my sleep. I too was paying $2000/mth. I moved as soon as my lease was up. \n\nSome people physically cannot tolerate the smell and they shouldn\u2019t be penalized for asking the property managers to enforce the rules.", "NTA. Could the letter have been written better, yeah. But you complained multiple times first. The weed stinking up your apartment is unacceptable.", "NTA - I\u2019d be pissed and expect smell remediation immediately from the responsible party. Smoke-free should be smoke-free.", "NTA: The smell is horrible. If you live in a place that bans indoor smoking, just go outside to smoke. You can't be shocked if your actions have consequences.", "YTA.\n\"I made sure it didn't sound threatening\". Ok, sure. \nThat's not how you write a letter, and what was the point in giving those numbers? I've been in property management for 20 years and I'd offer you to break the lease at no charge just to be rid of you.", "\nHere\u2019s the thing: you absolutely are entitled to a smoke-free environment, given the terms of your lease. There are many reasons that people might want or need a smoke free apartment complex. Having a small child or baby in the house, being in active (especially new) recovery, health concerns ranging from lung issues to neurological issues. The list could go on an every one of those reasons is valid and acceptable, even just \u201cI do not like the way it smells.\u201d You literally pay for a smoke free environment. And especially now, there are so many ways people can imbibe without impacting others \u2014 the range of edibles is truly astonishing. \n\nHere is where I say: I have never smoked or used any illegal substances. Ever. I didn\u2019t even drink until I was 21. I have two small children and I get absolutely apoplectic when my neighbor\u2019s twenty something son smoke fifty feet from our (open) windows and the smoke pours into our house. I am on your side. I promise you that I am on your side.\n\nYTA. You have not, at least according to this post, gone directly to the offending neighbors and asked them to stop or made them aware that it was impacting you. You broke neighborly code to escalate immediately to the office. Your management team should have intervened, absolutely, but you skipped a step. Most smokers (of any substance) have no idea how much they smell. They don\u2019t know that everyone can smell it on them for hours. That it spreads. I don\u2019t think my neighbor\u2019s twenty-something son knows that when he smokes we have to close the windows and turn on the AC because we have not told him. I assume he would move to a different part of his yard to smoke! I don\u2019t know because it is easier to just shut our house up.\n\nBut you are now threatening to contact the DEA for a substance that has historically resulted in MOSTLY Black men and women ending up in prison. You\u2019re threatening to contact governmental agencies before you even consider asking your neighbors to choose a different route for ingesting the weed. You are so thin-skinned and so scared that you would rather have their apartment raided or have them evicted than have to tell them they are doing something that upsets you.\n\nGrow up. Talk to them. Stop escalating petty squabbles to the DEA. WTF.", "YTA\n\n>I'd be happy to contact \\[City\\] Code Enforcement. They can be reached at \\*\\*\\*-\\*\\*\\*-\\*\\*\\*\\*.

If you got an email like that, would you want to help the person who sent it to you?\n\nPro tip: when you're angry and passionate about something and write an email, write it and walk away until you calm down.  Then come back and cut out at least 2/3rd of it.  \n\nLOL at the DEA part, too.

You say you sent this, but not to whom you sent it. I'm guessing it was sent to your property manager. Your tone is rude and combative. If you haven't complained before they would not know about the problem. Why couldn't you just send a polite letter informing them instead of threatening and cursing at them immediately?", "YTA. This is apartment living. If you have so much money for housing why are you renting an apartment if you can\u2019t handle having neighbors so close? Have you ever considered renting or buying a house so you don\u2019t have to share walls with strangers who don\u2019t live the way you do? \n\nI have to laugh at this. I had an apartment that sometimes reeked of cigarette smoke, I don\u2019t know how or who was the cause but I can\u2019t imagine writing a \u201cnon-threatening\u201d letter that is actually very threatening over a smell that went away in a short amount of time. I just lit some candles and went on with my day, I didn\u2019t spend time looking up government agencies phone numbers to make myself sound imposing to my landlord.

You've reported to multiple times so I think you did the right thing being blunt that you know your rights and who else to report this to above them.", "NTA.

The ones being the assholes are the ones smoking  pot in what is a smoke-free complex . \n\nI have bad migraines and I'm allergic to weed , if I had this situation it would be a nightmare to me. \n\nAlso , to those saying oh why don't you just rent a house ?? A house is a lot more maintenance, not to mention they can cost more than that rent of this apartment (depending on the area)  and the apartment can be closer for work .", "NTA. Your letter wasn't very businesslike but the message was clear and is justified. Good luck with this situation.", "YTA for going over the top with this, get the number for corporate and contact them.  No need for all the other BS.", "ESH", "YTA.  Why don\u2019t you move?
