{"id": 19258, "submission_id": "143p2oy", "title": "AITA for refusing to eat a meal made incorrectly?", "selftext": "I (19F) recently went out to eat with a few friends (19F, 20F, 20F). For some important background, I keep kosher. Without getting into too much detail this is a type of religious restricted diet. The most important thing this means when I eat out is that I do not eat meat. This is normally not an issue, as I'm pretty much just a vegetarian when I go out to eat.  \nWell, my friends and I went to a restaurant recently and I was shocked to see that they literally had no vegetarian options, like literally not even a salad without chicken on it. Because all the options had meat, and it was a nice-ish place, the food was also pretty expensive. When the waitress came around take our order I asked if I could get an option without the meat. She told me I could, but I would still have to pay full price. I wasn't thrilled by this, but I didn't want to make a big deal about it, so I ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo without the chicken.  \nOur food came some time later and everyone started eating. As soon as I got mine I was a bit annoyed, as there was clearly chicken in it. I felt bad informing the waitress, but I literally couldn\u2019t eat it with the chicken. She came back about 5 minutes later with a plate. Before I even took my first bite I noticed a clump in the noodles. At first I just hoped it was broccoli or something, but nope, it was clearly chicken. I kept looking and there were a few pieces. I assume what happened is that they just tried to pick the pieces of chicken out, which wasn't surprising to me considering how quickly the waitress came back.  \nAnyway, my friends all saw me looking a bit annoyed, and looking around for the waitress and one of them (we'll call her Ella) asked me what was wrong. I told her and she very dramatically rolled her eyes. She told me to grow up and just eat around it and to stop being so embarrassing. I was really hurt by this as she was aware of my dietary restrictions and she was the one who picked the restaurant. I tried to just let the comment go, and I just sat there for the rest of the meal not eating my food, but still engaging in conversation, just really trying to not let something so stupid ruin the night.  \nAfter I got home Ella texted me and told me how embarrassing I was acting at the restaurant. She said it was extremely immature and childish of my to refuse to eat my food, and even her 5 year old sister wasn't that picky. Ella informed me that I would not be invited out with her again, which honestly was fine with me.  \nI'll be honest, I really don't think I'm the asshole here, but now a few of Ella and my mutual friends (who were not at the restaurant) are texting me telling me to just apologize to Ella for embarrassing her.

The restaurant was awful and your friends were both cruel and antisemitic.", "NTA but I have two unsolicited advices for you to help reduce the risks if running in that kind of situation in the future! First, when you're invited to a restaurant, check the menu in advance, 90% of restaurants have their menu online now. If they are no suitable options for you, you can ask if the venue can be changed, or you can decide you don't want to go after all, or if you go anyway, you'll have had more time to decide what you're gonna eat. If you swap out the meat of something, swapping a dish that has meat you could eat if it was kosher, and that doesn't have dairy, will make you feel less bad about just tossing the meat on the sides if the request is not respected. But it brings me to my second.\n2- if you ask for a swap, tell the server/restaurant it's for kosher reason, not because you're not eating meat. You have much greater chance that your request will be taken seriously, because vegetarian and vegan get a bad rap these days and a lot of people likes to frustrate them just for the heck of it", "NTA regardless of the reason why you asked for no chicken you should get no chicken. The restaurant stuffed up, if I was your friend I would be annoyed with the server/chef on your behalf not uninviting you to future events.", "NTA. They messed up.", "NTA. The only person in that situation who is embarrassing and immature is Ella. Also big poo poo to the ignorance of the waitress and whoever prepared your meal. That\u2019s disgusting.", "I hope you didn\u2019t pay for that meal!\n\nNTA, they didn\u2019t meet your dietary restrictions and you should have asked for the manager when it wasn\u2019t fixed.", "NTA, there\u2019s a difference between \u201cI don\u2019t like\u201d and \u201cmy religion/morals forbid\u201d.

You just have to be somewhat considerate. \n\nTell Ella that you won\u2019t apologize for respectfully practicing your religion without forcing it on others.\n\nFriends accommodate for such things.", "Absolutely NTA. Next time though make it loud and clear (while being polite of course!) that you\u2019re modifying your dish because of religious reasons, that will make it more likely that they\u2019ll take you seriously.

My family actually waits an hour after having meat to have anything with milk in it.

For a meat to be kosher there are a few different rules that must apply. First, only certain types of meat are kosher in the first place, but that's another discussion. For an animal to be kosher it must be killed without pain, be completely healthy, and blessed by a rabbi. If all of these rules are met, the meat gets \"kosher certified\". Even after it is kosher certified, it must then be cooked in a kosher kitchen to ensure that it does not come into contact with milk. Kosher meats are much more expensive, which is why restaurants basically never serve them. If a restaurant is serving kosher meat, they most likely also have a kosher certificate, but again these are difficult to get because it means all milk and meat must be separate (different plate, pans, utensils, etc.). So it's safe to assume that unless advertised, most restaurants do not have kosher meat. I've only been to one kosher restaurant in my life, and have only ever seen a few of them.", "But if you go to an ordinary restaurant, the meat is not going to be kosher. So when eating out, it is easiest to just opt for vegetarian.\n\nI am astounded though that any decent restaurant now does not have a vegetarian option!", "Because most meat at restaurants isn\u2019t Kosher and it\u2019s just easier than trying to determine if it\u2019s Kosher or not.", "Kosher meats aren\u2019t actually \u201ckosher\u201d unless the animal was slaughtered properly. There\u2019s also the whole not mixing meat and dairy and \u201cbeing vegetarian\u201d is generally easier than the whole no dairy in anything involving the meal prep or meal.", "It can be hard to get meat dishes that are prepared according to kosher laws. Probably safer to abstain unless the restaurant specializes. I went to a vegan, kosher dim sum place once :)", "This is actually a super fair point, and it's totally on me for not including it in the original post, but I did ask Ella to make sure there was something I could eat and she said there was.

That's kind of one of the whole points of kosher restaurants. They're 100% guaranteeing that will never happen.", "I don't know what to tell you, I know a family who waits a day. And Utensils and pans have to be cleaned, so I personally feel like it is very different from using utensils that have touched meat and have been cleaned, and just eating the meat itself.", "I totally understand what you're saying. Ideally my family and I would only eat at kosher restaurants when we go out (which is pretty rarely), but unfortunately that's just not feasible for us. The possibility that something unkosher might have touched our food/utensils is unfortunately just something we kind of have to live with.", "They wait 24 hours between meat and dairy. Sure. Uh huh. \n\nOh yeah it\u2019s definitely different than eating the meat itself. I didn\u2019t say to eat the meat. But also having worked in kitchens and having friends who work in kitchens, I\u2019d say it\u2019s more likely that not all the utensils used are being washed between uses. \n\nAnyway there\u2019s nothing wrong with you insisting on returning a meal that\u2019s been made wrong. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s a difference within Jewish law here. But that doesnt mean you have to be comfortable with that or compromise on your own standards", "Listen, you don't know these people, you don't know how committed they are.

I'm not sure if it was a duplex they merged, or there was a small kitchen on the walkout basement level for grilling, or they converted a wet bar, but they have a meat kitchen on the main level and a dairy kitchen on the lower level.", "I know one Jewish person and they have two different sets of cookware/utensils/crockery for meat/dairy and rotate them week on week off so 24 hours sounds pretty reasonable to me.", "I don\u2019t think their liars. I think there was some form of miscommunication between op and these other people. Because being committed doesn\u2019t apply to things that aren\u2019t actually part of the religious practice. \nThere are different lengths of time that people wait, and those times vary even amongst the most committed people because they are based on different interpretations and understandings of the guidelines as they have been past orally through generations. There are extremely committed people who wait 1 hour and extremely committed people who wait 6. What makes them committed isn\u2019t how long they suffer through a wait, but rather how firmly they cling to an interpretation they believe is correct based on their (or more likely their rabbis) interpretation of source materials. \nBut 24 hours isn\u2019t one of those times", "I mean my grandfather actually had a \u201cJewish law degree.\u201d I can\u2019t give too much information without doxxing myself but he actually works with Bet Din (Jewish legal courts). I personally just had 14 years of religious education, so no law degree but I do know what I\u2019m talking about. \nMy guess is that op misunderstood what this other family was saying because that\u2019s not a law of kosher", "Yeah. My family had two sets of dishes lol. And the oven was for meat only. Dairy was only ever cooked in a toaster oven. I\u2019m extremely well aware of how rigorous kosher law can be because my family kept to the highest standards of it. We were ultra orthodox and my grandfather was the rabbi of our community. My sisters had 14 years of religious education. My brothers had 16. \nWe kept extremely high standards of Jewish law. The rest of my family still does. \nBut 24 hours between meat and dairy isn\u2019t cited in jewish law. It just isnt", "Yes we also had two sets of everything. But if I had to put money on it, I\u2019d say that the people you know did not wait a week between eating meat and dairy. The rotating week by week was about what dishes would be out and available for cooking because most peoples kitchens aren\u2019t big enough to store both conveniently in your kitchen. So they\u2019d alternate what they cooked each week possibly. But they\u2019d still, say, eat a burger on a dairy week as long as they didn\u2019t cook it at home.", "When there\u2019s a range, some people will go the low end, some people will go the high end. And then there are those who will go to the extremes on either end outside of the scale.\n\nThat\u2019s human nature. No matter what a book says.", "Neither is having two kitchens. \n\nPeople make their own decisions about Judaism."]}
