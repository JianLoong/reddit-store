I thought that was why people went to weddings. Am I the only one?", "Nah. You don't have to go. That's your right. It's not a summons. \n\nTbh I'd prefer to go to a reception vs a ceremony. It's stuffy and sitting around being quiet and watching (unless your apart of it) sounds boring. \n\nWhere as the reception everyone interacts drinks food music and dancing.", "NAH\n\nI had a small ceremony--11 total & that was immediate family & my BFF & his BFF. Our reception was also relatively small--60 people or so, and I had a very good out-of-state friend attend who lives near my BFF about 5 hrs away. I would've totally understood if she didn't come at all. That's sweet you want to celebrate in a more intimate way for them!", "NAH but it\u2019s super normal for people to have a tiny ceremony and only invite others to reception. Why do you want to attend the ceremony anyway?", "The reception is the best part! There is cake, and maybe dancing, and they will feed you. There may even be alcohol , and you don\u2019t even have to sit through the, (I\u2019m\nsorry, sometimes overlong), ceremony. \n\nNTA if you want to send  a polite RSVP \u201cno\u201d, it\u2019s up to you.", "NTA, but I would not go if it's the other way around. The reception is the fun part.", "NTA. \n\nYou are allowed to feel that way, but just know it may be offensive to them if you voice that. Which is understandable because they may view the reception being just as important as the ceremony. But you know them, I don\u2019t. I also don\u2019t know the reason they decided for it to be intimate, but I would assume they still want friends to come celebrate them on their big night. \n\nIt\u2019s really up to you how honest you want to be about it, but if you feel like you\u2019re being an AH, just come up with an excuse to avoid hurting their feelings. \u201cSomething came up, sorry, but I\u2019d love to take you both to dinner sometime to make up for it.\u201d", "A close friend you say?  Said you\u2019d be there?  I\u2019m going to say soft YTA.  Soft because it was a bit of a bait n switch.  That said, it sounds like the reception is where the real celebration of the marriage is happening for/with friends.  How important is this friendship to you? You know your friend. Are they likely to miss you being there? This whole thing is a bit weird given the rushed  \u201cplanning\u201d etc.", "This is completely opposite to what I was expecting from the headline. \n\nUsually people can\u2019t afford the big fancy wedding so they invite everyone to the ceremony, and only select guests are invited to the reception. Then the guests who are excluded from the reception are insulted. \n\nIf this is a close friend, you should be there to support your friend whether it\u2019s at the ceremony or the reception, especially if you have already RSVP\u2019d that you will be attending. \n\nIf you already RSVP\u2019d you will attend, and then cancel you WBTA. \n\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re not close with this person, and you haven\u2019t yet responded to the invitation, you can RSVP that you are unable to attend and arrange a dinner with the couple later and you would not be TA.", "I\u2019m gonna dissent from the crowd and go YTA\n\nI got married earlier this year and our ceremony was just our parents and siblings with the rest of the guests invited to the reception. I would have been really hurt if someone I considered a good friend had decided not to come without a good reason.", "Weird. The reception is the fun part. And the expensive part for the couple. \n\nThe church is the boring bit. \n\nLove this plan. \n\nCeremonies are boring", "I've had people invite me to the wedding but not the reception and felt left out.

I don\u2019t understand exactly what you\u2019re saying. In my culture ceremonies are very small/private and receptions are for everyone to celebrate with the married couple. It\u2019s all \u201cthe wedding\u201d. That being said, it\u2019s clear that you don\u2019t want to go. That\u2019s fine. You won\u2019t make or break the wedding. And what you suggested sounds good to me. Just RSVP that something unexpected came up and you can\u2019t attend but would like to take them to dinner later. NTA", "Six hours for a reception? NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIt's rude to invite people to your wedding without actually inviting them to your wedding.", "NAH - your choice to go or not. \n\nBut the ceremony is the fun part\u2026", "We should normalize \u201creception only\u201d as a standard thing.

But most of the friend\u2019s weddings I\u2019ve gone to have just been only to the reception.  The church ceremony usually doesn\u2019t interest me.  \n\nAn invitation isn\u2019t a summons.  Don\u2019t go if only going to the dinner isn\u2019t worth the drive.", "NAH\n\nThey\u2019re letting you know where you stand. I wouldn\u2019t drive six hours for an acquaintance\u2019s party either.", "NTA, I think this is a non-malicious bait and switch. You were invited to the wedding, except you are not really invited to the wedding, just the reception. If the invitation had been clear it sounds like you would have sent regrets. \nIf a friend had asked me to attend their ceremony and be part of/ watch their special moment, I would probably choose to drive a long distance to go. I would probably NOT drive 6 houses each way and rent a hotel to go to a party. I would bring them out to dinner and give them a wedding gift.", "If you value them as friends, go. This is about loving and supporting them. They want to celebrate with you.", "NAH - unless your friend relying on you coming has paid for your meal /drink already  - do they have time to change the head count or invite somene else", "NTA. I'm with you OP, I want all or nothing. I wouldn't travel six hours for just the wedding or just the reception. However, I would travel and make a weekend out of it for both. To me, it's worth it for an entire event.", "NTA\n\nWas the planning actually last minute or did someone pull out which is why they asked you.  They may just want the numbers because the reception is already paid for?", "NAH, you don't gotta go if you don't want to, but I'm honestly kinda confused because I would love to be invited to just the reception; I get the party and free food without sitting through a ceremony lol. But to each thier own I guess.", "I would not drive 12 hours for a reception.", "You're not, if anything I would prefer it that way. Maybe I'm not too sentimental, but I don't like sitting and waiting in pews, or sitting in chairs outside, and waiting and waiting. And then it's this whole procession, and then speeches or a performance and vows. \n\nAt least when there's speeches at the reception, there's usually drinks or food.", "I prefer to see the ceremony as well.  Especially when I\u2019m driving six hours.", "Ha! That\u2019s what I thought too. Give me the food, I\u2019ll miss all the talking.", "To me the ceremony is the most signifiant part- I can have dinner or party with my friends or family any time, but seeing them get married is special. \n\nInviting somebody to just the reception to me says \u201cWe like you enough to party with us, but you\u2019re not actually that important to us\u201d. It\u2019s fair enough if a couple think that, but I don\u2019t have to drive six hours to accommodate them.", "Receptions are definitely the fun part. But I\u2019m not big on partying anyways. \n\nIf he was wanting me there as one of a few invited to the wedding because he wanted me to share that moment with him and his fianc\u00e9, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell him no. But just going up there to celebrate seems like a bit much. \n\nWe live close to each other so it\u2019s not like I won\u2019t seem them for a long time or anything.", "Had the same exact thought. That's the fun part!", "Yep, I get that part. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all. I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s justifiable driving that distance, and paying for a hotel, just to party afterwards with a bunch of people I see often anyways lol. \n\nIt\u2019s different if they wanted me to share that moment of marriage between them. I wouldn\u2019t be able to say no.", "The only problem is that I already told him I could go before I knew it was for the reception lol. Seems like it\u2019s kind of an asshole move to say \u201cI\u2019m not going now because it\u2019s just for the reception\u201d", "Yeah I completely get why they\u2019d be upset too. I think they\u2019ll understand. I\u2019d never lie so I\u2019m just going to be honest with them. I\u2019m pretty sure the wedding is small due to monetary reasons, which I completely get and am not upset about in the slightest.\n\nUltimately I think they will naturally be upset, but not anywhere close to \u201cwe\u2019re never gonna be friends again.\u201d", "I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll miss me but it\u2019s not going to\nruin their night or wreck the friendship. And yeah I kind of dislike that it was sprung on me with only a little over a months notice. But that doesn\u2019t really play a factor in my decision.", "It is a close friend but haven\u2019t rsvp\u2019d anything yet. Just a verbal \u201cyeah I\u2019ll be there.\u201d 6 hours + hotel just seems like a bit much to just go party though.", "Was your reception out of state to where guests would have to stay overnight? If so, would that have changed how you felt about some people not coming?", "I don\u2019t think \u201cletting me know where I stand\u201d or just calling them an acquaintance is fair. We\u2019ve been friends a long time, and it\u2019s not like other friends are invited to the ceremony. It\u2019s close family only. If it was just an acquaintance, I probably wouldn\u2019t be driving 6 hours for anything \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah I completely agree. That\u2019s kind of where I\u2019m at with the whole situation. I wouldn\u2019t have said yeah if I knew it was just for the reception originally.", "I don\u2019t think they have yet. I\u2019d think there\u2019s still time to change. It\u2019s not going to be anything extravagant.", "> If he was wanting me there as one of a few invited to the wedding because he wanted me to share that moment with him\n\nFor me the ceremony is between the married couple and God, or the married couple and the government in a non-religious wedding. The celebration is between the couple and their family and friends. That's the important part for people to go to.", "Ceremonies are like maybe a half hour long at most unless it\u2019s a catholic wedding. I\u2019m not sure why a half hour makes the at much of a difference in your decision to attend. Like I said, no one is an asshole but that just seems weird.", "Suck it up and go if you value this friendship.", "It is.", "True, and like I said, you know them. Everyone\u2019s different. I\u2019m a people pleaser, so I admire that you want to be totally honest. I try to be, but also hate upsetting people\u2026 but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll appreciate that you\u2019re being up front about it.", "It\u2019s almost certainly not for monetary reasons. People attending the ceremony costs next to nothing (or literally nothing). The reception is the expensive part.", "But an extra 30-40 minutes of ceremony time would make the trip worth while? \n\nYou said this is a close friend and you did give a verbal RSVP, in my opinion, you need to attend or you WBTA. \n\nYour friend will remember that you said you will be there and then backed out. If your friend ever finds out the reason you backed out, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you lose that friend because of it.", "It was in state for me, but my good friends are all 12+ hours away, so they had to fly in and stay 2-3 nights, just as I have done for their weddings. \n\nIf one of them simply couldn\u2019t have afforded that, I\u2019d have understood. But if one of them just didn\u2019t think the hassle and expense was worth it just to celebrate with us, I would have been incredibly hurt and I would have started wondering where I had misunderstood the quality of that friendship.", "So no other friends are invited? Just CLOSE family, and you are peeved you only got invited to the reception? If none of their friends are going then you kinda don\u2019t have a right to be snippy about their reception.", "Literally no friends? Not her two actual friends? Just parents and siblings? If that\u2019s true then it\u2019s petty to be mad about. If she\u2019s invited ANY friends then you\u2019re not it.", "Then my statement stands. no assholes here.", "Ceremony time has nothing to do with it. It could be a 5 minute courthouse wedding, if he wanted me to be there to share that moment him and his fianc\u00e9 were joined as 1, then I\u2019d do it. Feels like we could party and celebrate it anytime back home though.", "I guess that\u2019s where we differ then. I\u2019d never expect any of my friends to travel that distance for any kind of ceremony or celebration. If they did that\u2019s awesome, but I don\u2019t think it would make me reconsider friendships if not.", "Not peeved that I didn\u2019t get invited to the wedding. That\u2019s not an issue at all. I just don\u2019t see the point in spending a lot of time and money just to go party with a few friends and their family. I see all of the friends that will be there a good bit as it is.", "I\u2019m not mad about it lol. Just don\u2019t think the time and money is worth going to a party when I see these people pretty often anyways.", "Sure you could, but they are choosing to celebrate at that time and place. NAH here but it seems odd that you're attendance hinges on the ceremony. From your comments I'm gathering that maybe you just don't think weddings are a big deal, and that's OK, but specifically not going bc you aren't going to the ceremony is an odd flex", "Fair enough, although what really matters here is how your friend will feel, not how you would feel in their shoes.", "Could you possibly be more passive aggressive and elusive?", "So by this logic you'll never go to anyone's wedding, because yoy can see the people anytime?", "Literally exactly the opposite lol. I think the actual ceremony and moment is a bigger deal than the reception. Not sure how that\u2019s a flex either but alright.", "How am I being passive aggressive or elusive \ud83e\udd23 What a wild response. I literally could not care less that they want to save money with a small wedding. I\u2019ll probably do the same. I\u2019m not traveling that far just to party though.", "It feels like the problem is you feel slighted by not getting a ceremony invite and now because you weren\u2019t \u2018special\u2019 enough to get one you don\u2019t want to go and celebrate with your friends.  Don\u2019t let those feelings make you miss out on your friends special day.  Just go - it\u2019s their wedding, not a backyard BBQ."]}
