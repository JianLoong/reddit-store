If not, that's on her, you have done nothing wrong.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH or maybe soft YTA. The way she acted was definitely weird and uncalled for, but it sounds like she reacted that way because she had some creepy experiences with coworkers at previous jobs. Either that, or she\u2019s a bit socially awkward, or both. I don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve taken it personally, because she clearly wasn\u2019t trying to be rude on purpose. \n\nIn addition, the way you describe yourself as a personality hire feels a little weird.

She was probably just nervous, tried to make it right, and made it even worse. She's feeling like an idiot, I assure you.

I said she was welcome and she left the lunch area but the people I was with all quizzed me about what that interaction was about - including my partner - so then I had to explain etc. They all understood but they did ask what I gonna do moving forward and I just said I'd give her some space. \nShe's not said a word to me since nor me to her, outside of group emails.\n\nAlso sorry if it seemed odd describing my role, I just thought it was important for context, if I worked in her department etc we'd be forced to work together but I'm on an entirely separate team and only really report (through my team leader) to the C level employees so there no real reason for her and I to need to interact if that makes sense?", "Sorry, can you clarify?", "Thanks for replying, sorry but \"doing it\", what exactly?\nI'm never ever rude or anything remotely like that, but I'm not sure what I'd apologise for?\nShe's on the team calendar for all events and anyone we hang with outside the office is free to invite her for lunch or our other activities. \nShe didn't feel comfortable enough to approach me about it so I don't wanna push for her to come in person and risk making things worse y'know?", "Can I ask, in what way was my description of myself a red flag? I was just trying to give some context regarding my role in the office and my general demeanour.

If so, do you invite her?\n\nIf not, then I\u2019m confused about why this is a conflict/why you\u2019re in the center of it.

But I think you being a key player in many of these out of work events has built a strong link in her mind between that rocky start and her perception of how you view her.

I'd keep my distance from her as well, if I were you.  \n\nOn the one hand, I fully agree with her desire to keep personal and professional lives separate.  You respect her desire to do this, so you obviously don't invite her to out-of-work functions.\n\nBut, then she complains that she's \"out of the loop\" on out-of-work functions.

First she made drama with the card thing, she could possibly make drama with the after work socializing if she is excluded. It only takes one apple to ruin the bunch, but now that your workplace is warmer and less cold and more sociable keep in mind that there might be a middle ground and you may want to branch out of your workplace hangouts to those with your closer friends. Best of luck", "NTA. Maybe other people are not inviting her because they know something you don't know. What if she has done something similar to others? I doubt that her being iced out has anything to do with you. Continue to keep your distance. The truth will come out eventually.", "NTA. \n\nIf I had to guess, you're not the only one who was taken aback by her assumption. If I knew this person had a history of assuming romantic interest after half a sentence and a smile, I would not be inviting her to lunch either. Who knows to what conclusions she would come.\n\nShe apologized to you in front of a bunch of people, I'm sure that story had gone through the entire office within the hour.

Clearly she has had a bad experience in the past. She was afraid and now she\u2019s being shunned.\n\nEdit to add. At the very least it could just be a romance went sour and she was the one who had to leave her job. Since she\u2019s the new employee at your place. And didn\u2019t want it to happen again.

She's made it perfectly clear that she's there to work, not socialize. Respecting her boundaries would absolutely not make him an asshole.", "Exactly. The assumption here seems to be \"she's a nice lady who's new and possibly a little embarrassed over accusing someone of hitting on her. Be nice to her.\"\n\nThat's not my read. I see a woman who intentionally made an innocent encounter very awkward, and instead of being contrite, goes running to her coworkers to complain OP is now leaving her out. She sounds manipulative and professionally dangerous to OP. \n\nKeep her at arm's length, OP. Never be alone with her. You're NTA.", "Edit: didn\u2019t realise how long that was! In short - I think there\u2019s definitely potential that she made a mistake, knows she got it very wrong, and has no way to rectify it herself without looking worse. \n\nI agree - I think she maybe had a previous experience that she projected and defaulted to \u2018keep work and personal separate\u2019 as a sort of gentle way to rebuff without offending, not necessarily that she actually doesn\u2019t ever want to interact outside of work. She clearly realised she got it very wrong and came to apologise and I feel like the continued deliberate lack of inviting her to the less work based social activities is almost becoming punitive - a little like malicious compliance for her incorrect assumption in the first place? \n\nShe\u2019s probably mortified that she jumped to a conclusion and now feels incredibly awkward in the office, knowing she\u2019s being left out of things, and doesn\u2019t really know how to start over and feel like any other part of the team. Another commenter said to maybe start slowly inviting her to a couple of things that aren\u2019t work social activities, even via your partner if there is still some awkwardness. I\u2019d make an attempt or two as you\u2019re obviously aware, and so are colleagues, that there\u2019s some tension there and she\u2019s not entirely comfortable at work. \n\nI think if you\u2019re not inviting her because she was erroneously trying to \u2018let someone down gently\u2019 by saying she doesn\u2019t mix work and personal then it\u2019s definitely worth bearing in mind that it may well have not been how she really felt and that she has no real course of action to \u2018reset\u2019 the dynamic because inviting yourself to things isn\u2019t appropriate. Even just a straight up conversation, with someone else there, to say that you know things started off awkwardly but would she like to be included may be worth trying?\n\nI get that she \u2018started it\u2019 and set the tone by the first interaction but, given how you describe yourself and the office dynamic, it just may be worth giving her a second chance. \n\nNAH, but I think it\u2019s worth trying to find out if her initial reaction was knee jerk or whether that\u2019s genuinely how she feels about out of work activities. Especially as colleagues have now approached you about it so it\u2019s probably quite noticeable.", "Why is the onus on OP to fix anything? He didn\u2019t cause the initial awkwardness and he\u2019s not the one who isn\u2019t inviting her to non work events. He is also not the one she is complaining to.\n\nOP is NTA", "She's new to their workplace and has already TWICE made allegations against OP. There's nothing to bridge. This woman is bad news.", "from my experience, canned replies from people mean they have some experience that made that canned reply happen. \n\nI've had one woman colleague, who was honest to god lusted after by half the people the company worked with - from clients, through suppliers to delivery drivers. one 'man' had the audacity to steal flowers her BF bought her earlier, and replace them with a box of candy he brought with him.", "Yeah but I can also see peoples reluctance to invite her out. It sucks that she\u2019s being iced out but some companies take harassment complaints seriously (as they should). If people are drinking, and she decides that someone is \u201chitting on her\u201d in a similar fashion to OP\u2019s key incident? No one wants to run the risk of being reported for something they didn\u2019t do. \n\nWe\u2019re in a recession right now. Socializing with someone who thinks people are making a pass at them isn\u2019t worth the risk of losing your job. I would give her another chance but I would make sure I\u2019d be extremely public and in mixed sex company for the purpose of having witnesses. Maybe she\u2019ll be cool, but I really understand why folks aren\u2019t chomping at the bit to befriend her.", "Just a thought, but have you raised this to HR?

Not in a recession. That requires specific quarters of job loss and more.", "OP shouldn't risk themselve after what happened, she will take it wrong again. \nSo if coworker wants to talk about it SHE should be the one approaching OP and clear the air since is the one with issues.\n\n\nNTA", "There is an interpersonal conflict because the New hire did apologize for the misinterpretation following the confrontation pretty  quickly.
