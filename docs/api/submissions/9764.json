The way she acted was definitely weird and uncalled for, but it sounds like she reacted that way because she had some creepy experiences with coworkers at previous jobs. Either that, or she\u2019s a bit socially awkward, or both.

She was probably just nervous, tried to make it right, and made it even worse. She's feeling like an idiot, I assure you.

I said she was welcome and she left the lunch area but the people I was with all quizzed me about what that interaction was about - including my partner - so then I had to explain etc. They all understood but they did ask what I gonna do moving forward and I just said I'd give her some space. \nShe's not said a word to me since nor me to her, outside of group emails.\n\nAlso sorry if it seemed odd describing my role, I just thought it was important for context, if I worked in her department etc we'd be forced to work together but I'm on an entirely separate team and only really report (through my team leader) to the C level employees so there no real reason for her and I to need to interact if that makes sense?", "Sorry, can you clarify?", "Thanks for replying, sorry but \"doing it\", what exactly?\nI'm never ever rude or anything remotely like that, but I'm not sure what I'd apologise for?\nShe's on the team calendar for all events and anyone we hang with outside the office is free to invite her for lunch or our other activities. \nShe didn't feel comfortable enough to approach me about it so I don't wanna push for her to come in person and risk making things worse y'know?", "Can I ask, in what way was my description of myself a red flag? I was just trying to give some context regarding my role in the office and my general demeanour.

But I think you being a key player in many of these out of work events has built a strong link in her mind between that rocky start and her perception of how you view her.

I'd keep my distance from her as well, if I were you.  \n\nOn the one hand, I fully agree with her desire to keep personal and professional lives separate.  You respect her desire to do this, so you obviously don't invite her to out-of-work functions.\n\nBut, then she complains that she's \"out of the loop\" on out-of-work functions.

First she made drama with the card thing, she could possibly make drama with the after work socializing if she is excluded. It only takes one apple to ruin the bunch, but now that your workplace is warmer and less cold and more sociable keep in mind that there might be a middle ground and you may want to branch out of your workplace hangouts to those with your closer friends. Best of luck", "NTA. Maybe other people are not inviting her because they know something you don't know. What if she has done something similar to others? I doubt that her being iced out has anything to do with you. Continue to keep your distance. The truth will come out eventually.", "NTA. \n\nIf I had to guess, you're not the only one who was taken aback by her assumption. If I knew this person had a history of assuming romantic interest after half a sentence and a smile, I would not be inviting her to lunch either. Who knows to what conclusions she would come.\n\nShe apologized to you in front of a bunch of people, I'm sure that story had gone through the entire office within the hour.

Clearly she has had a bad experience in the past. She was afraid and now she\u2019s being shunned.\n\nEdit to add. At the very least it could just be a romance went sour and she was the one who had to leave her job. Since she\u2019s the new employee at your place. And didn\u2019t want it to happen again.

She's made it perfectly clear that she's there to work, not socialize. Respecting her boundaries would absolutely not make him an asshole.", "Exactly. The assumption here seems to be \"she's a nice lady who's new and possibly a little embarrassed over accusing someone of hitting on her. Be nice to her.\"\n\nThat's not my read. I see a woman who intentionally made an innocent encounter very awkward, and instead of being contrite, goes running to her coworkers to complain OP is now leaving her out. She sounds manipulative and professionally dangerous to OP. \n\nKeep her at arm's length, OP. Never be alone with her. You're NTA.", "Edit: didn\u2019t realise how long that was! In short - I think there\u2019s definitely potential that she made a mistake, knows she got it very wrong, and has no way to rectify it herself without looking worse. \n\nI agree - I think she maybe had a previous experience that she projected and defaulted to \u2018keep work and personal separate\u2019 as a sort of gentle way to rebuff without offending, not necessarily that she actually doesn\u2019t ever want to interact outside of work. She clearly realised she got it very wrong and came to apologise and I feel like the continued deliberate lack of inviting her to the less work based social activities is almost becoming punitive - a little like malicious compliance for her incorrect assumption in the first place? \n\nShe\u2019s probably mortified that she jumped to a conclusion and now feels incredibly awkward in the office, knowing she\u2019s being left out of things, and doesn\u2019t really know how to start over and feel like any other part of the team. Another commenter said to maybe start slowly inviting her to a couple of things that aren\u2019t work social activities, even via your partner if there is still some awkwardness. I\u2019d make an attempt or two as you\u2019re obviously aware, and so are colleagues, that there\u2019s some tension there and she\u2019s not entirely comfortable at work. \n\nI think if you\u2019re not inviting her because she was erroneously trying to \u2018let someone down gently\u2019 by saying she doesn\u2019t mix work and personal then it\u2019s definitely worth bearing in mind that it may well have not been how she really felt and that she has no real course of action to \u2018reset\u2019 the dynamic because inviting yourself to things isn\u2019t appropriate. Even just a straight up conversation, with someone else there, to say that you know things started off awkwardly but would she like to be included may be worth trying?\n\nI get that she \u2018started it\u2019 and set the tone by the first interaction but, given how you describe yourself and the office dynamic, it just may be worth giving her a second chance. \n\nNAH, but I think it\u2019s worth trying to find out if her initial reaction was knee jerk or whether that\u2019s genuinely how she feels about out of work activities. Especially as colleagues have now approached you about it so it\u2019s probably quite noticeable.", "Why is the onus on OP to fix anything? He didn\u2019t cause the initial awkwardness and he\u2019s not the one who isn\u2019t inviting her to non work events. He is also not the one she is complaining to.\n\nOP is NTA", "She's new to their workplace and has already TWICE made allegations against OP. There's nothing to bridge. This woman is bad news.", "from my experience, canned replies from people mean they have some experience that made that canned reply happen. \n\nI've had one woman colleague, who was honest to god lusted after by half the people the company worked with - from clients, through suppliers to delivery drivers. one 'man' had the audacity to steal flowers her BF bought her earlier, and replace them with a box of candy he brought with him.", "Yeah but I can also see peoples reluctance to invite her out. It sucks that she\u2019s being iced out but some companies take harassment complaints seriously (as they should). If people are drinking, and she decides that someone is \u201chitting on her\u201d in a similar fashion to OP\u2019s key incident? No one wants to run the risk of being reported for something they didn\u2019t do. \n\nWe\u2019re in a recession right now. Socializing with someone who thinks people are making a pass at them isn\u2019t worth the risk of losing your job. I would give her another chance but I would make sure I\u2019d be extremely public and in mixed sex company for the purpose of having witnesses. Maybe she\u2019ll be cool, but I really understand why folks aren\u2019t chomping at the bit to befriend her.", "Just a thought, but have you raised this to HR?

Not in a recession. That requires specific quarters of job loss and more.", "OP shouldn't risk themselve after what happened, she will take it wrong again. \nSo if coworker wants to talk about it SHE should be the one approaching OP and clear the air since is the one with issues.\n\n\nNTA", "There is an interpersonal conflict because the New hire did apologize for the misinterpretation following the confrontation pretty  quickly.

I would not be hurt or expect an invite from them because I made my intentions very clear in the beginning.  At work? I would bring in cupcakes, coffee, donuts, pizza, Christmas stockings with little gifts, etc. When one of our coworkers lost her dog, I went out to help look with Mt husband and eventually found the dog for her. He was originally the dog that belonged to a client that eventually passed away and her family adopted him. Since he had known us for much longer, we thought it would help to get him back. \n\nI was clear with my boundary  without being cold or causing drama or accusing my coworkers of inappropriate behavior.  It's appropriate to set boundaries, it's inappropriate to do it the way she did.", "So she said \u201cI want to keep work and home separate\u201d.

And this problem is supposed to be this dude's job to fix. \n\nMakes me wonder if there's a history of exclusion and his team was brought in because of lost talent, who moved on to less dramatic companies.", "In a nutshell yes that's exactly what she publicly asked for, so why she's now acting all shcoked pikachu face about her coworkers not inviting her to work/private events I don't know.\n\nPlus she hasn't exactly made a good first impression at the considering her first interaction with OP was to very publicly accuse him of inappropriate behaviour while not even letting him finish his sentence, so pretty much all the men at the workplace are probably now giving her a wide berth so they don't get accused of harrasment by her and have their jobs put at risk.", "That is what I was thinking.  OP is NTA because while it is their job to organize work events, it isn't their job to find a bff for this worker.  She asked to keep it separate and now it is on her to find friends.  Has she asked anyone out to lunch or happy hour or does she expect everyone to go to her first?", "That's the same thing I was thinking. She asked to keep a professional only relationship with fellow employees and that's what everyone is doing. Brings to mind the old saying...... Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it!", "That's exactly what i am thinking.\n\nIt's not about OP being the social core of the group, but mostly because of how she reacted. Probably most guys are now guarded against her, since what she did could be very damaging for OP. \n\nSo just like that, in a balanced work enviroment she lost half of potential friends or acquaintances. \n\nShe nuked herself.", "Yes. A lasting first impression.", "Ditto. As I woman, I would be very leery of this person. Boundaries are reasonable but this seems more like someone stirring up drama. If she was that guarded about a friendly attempt to return her pass, I can only imagine potential issues that would arise from socializing with her outside of work.", "I've had creepy things like that happened to me when I was young. People just assumed that because I was lovely, I was also available and immoral. \n\nBy my count, I've been stalked by 15 different \"people,\" who thought that crawling all over my life was perfectly acceptable behavior. \n\nSome people thought I was cold and stuck up because I wasn't a flirt, and I maintained a business only attitude at work and school.\n\nNTA, OP, but I feel sorry for that poor woman who has to put up so many barriers between herself and the world just to survive.", "A guy I worked with - to whom I'd said maybe four sentences - emailed me to tell me he had received my subliminal messages, and that he would break up with his fiancee so we could be together.    There are some scary fuckers out there.", "She's now the person who will walk around with toilet paper stuck to her shoe for a full hour because no one will want to tell her about it.", "I have had plenty of new jobs and am a woman. Even working on a team as the only woman, I haven't had to be subjected to that.", "Sounds more like OP doesn\u2019t want to be falsely accused of anything. Sounds like this woman doesn\u2019t know what she wants.", "how is she nice? im genuinely curious", "If only emotions could be shut off that easily. People have baggage and sometimes that baggage spills over on the wrong people.", "NotAllMen. But yes All Men who make unsolicited approaches. She is absolutely entitled to be wary, and their feelings are not more important than her safety. Women are routinely taught to be polite and to disregard their instincts so as not to offend a man.", "She didn\u2019t accuse him of being inappropriate, she was trying to set a firm boundary albeit very awkwardly.  Sometimes you handle things the wrong way before you learn the right way.", "She hardly \u201caccused\u201d him of anything. Yeah, she should have let him finish the sentence, but you\u2019re acting like she filed a malicious false complaint about inappropriate behavior or something. It was a misunderstanding. Not a big deal.", "Definitely experienced it in both food service and retail, but but not so much in office work... though it would not shock me.", "Yes but they are one\u2019s personal responsibility to manage. He owes her nothing at this point. She should be the one taking the lead on how she wants to be approached or engaged with at work, and should not be shocked if not everyone wants to play ball.", "So what is his question? I don\u2019t get why he even posted.", "Right? What sounds nice about her", "And when that fucks up your professional life, you only have yourself to blame. I say this from experience.", "And it's not those people's responsibility to cater to the irrational emotions. He was polite, he continues to be polite. He's under no obligation to go outside his comfort zone after receiving a reaction such as he did, and including her in unofficial events. She, intentionally or not, made her bed, and is now laying in it.", "You have to address that with a therapist or something, because as seen here, you'll fuck up your professional life if you make that baggage everyone else's problem.", "Yeah, and most people don't have the patience or would even care so it's best to keep your baggage to yourself or you will be ostracized.", "Agreed, but OP was innocent here. While the woman's actions may have been understandable (we don't know her experiences), he's now received the backlash of her issues. OP is NTA - he needs to protect himself too.", "As a woman I can agree with you to some degree. But in a professional workplace, you've gotta let the dude finish a sentence before giving the speech. It's not a polite thing really, not in this case, it's a don't make an assumption in the workplace thing.", ">She is absolutely entitled to be wary, and their feelings are not more important than her safety.\n\nHer safety isn't being threatened by a coworker talking to her. She's not at all entitled to be wary of a coworker talking to her *at their job* when he's not given any indication that he's interested in something more.", "It's an office building and the guy hadn't said 5 words to her yet. Does she never expect to get approached by anyone ever at work?", "Lol, what safety? She was at the workplace, not in the dark alley to feel endengered. She didn't even let OP finish saying what broought him to her desk. How was he supposed to act to not make \"unsolicited approach\"? By making it about notallmen you only make this important slogan sound funny.", "Adding to this, it can be scary! What if when we offended him we got attacked or singled out. It\u2019s not even only about feelings! As you know", "Boundary that was not needed. The polite way is to let him finish and then say no. She was rude. And no matter the situation in previous company. She\u2019s new here and doesn\u2019t know anyone. \nEveryone in the company knows OP is friendly, easygoing and in a committed relationship. She\u2019s the new one. And her way is exactly how you make enemies. Really a guy coming to you with a smile - instant reaction if rejection? She\u2019s new, someone wants something , even to introduce himself and she goes straight to \u201cNope, not interested\u201d? \nNo. She was rude.", "She didn\u2019t even let him get a sentence out.  She made the mistake not him, and it was right for her to apologize.  She set a tone not to be approached socially by setting that boundary and now she\u2019s upset people respected it.  If her past issues are interfering with her day to day life she needs therapy.", "And sometimes a single bad interaction can leave a bad taste in the other's mouth to the point where they would rather maintain distance afterwards, even if the other party later regrets that interaction.\n\nA premptive rejection rejection implies a very clear \"stay the fuck away from me in general\", and when there was no pass intended in the first place, it also implies \"I'm going to assume things you don't intend.\"\n\nThe dangers are different, but men also feel the need to protect themselves from dangerous situations. And this interaction sets off alarm bells for me, intended or not.", "In a professional workplace environment she absolutely did, especially when she made her public apology and put OP on the spot in having to defend himself against a situation where even before a full sentence was uttered, she assumed she was dealing with OP's unwanted sexual advances.", "She should at least wait to be asked before refusing, no?", "When she had the interaction at her desk, that was a misunderstanding.  \n\nWhen she publicly disclosed that she thought he was going to acting inappropriate by asking her out, something that HR can construe as unwanted sexual advances, yes when just once, welcome to the corporate world, and OP had to publicly defend himself, she turned that misunderstanding into an accusation of impropriety and for OP was a big deal even if it wasn't a official HR complaint.", "I agree her behaviour was poor but she never actually out and out accused OP of harassing her. She interrupted OP to put a boundary in place about keeping work and personal life separate, which is a silly thing to do when she had no idea what OP was talking to her about, but also not the same as accusing him of anything. Then she explained her reasoning and apologised for misinterpretting- a silly thing to do in front of a bunch of coworkers, but again, not an accusation. \n\nShe obviously internally assumed that was what OP was doing, but she's within her rights to do that.", "Dude, OP just recently found out over workplace grapevine that she's been complaining to other coworkers she's upset that she's not being invited to non-office events, including OP's own private events with coworkers.\n\nNow OP had not invited her to his private events because she's made him extremely uncomfortable with her  unfounded and overly quick to judgement accusations of impropriety and publicly calling him on it with her public apology, forcing him to defend himself in public.  \n\nOP now is wondering if it's his fault that others have also not invited her to their private non-office events, that if maybe they're just following his behavior of not inviting her to his private events.", "She apologized, ffs. It'd be one thing if she hadn't, but y'all are so willing to go overboard against someone in a new workplace making a dumb mistake that wasn't repeated, and was apologized for.", "I'm guessing you're a white man by this comment alone. Men do not experience the same *quantity* of sexual harassment as women in the workplace. And although all harassment is horrible, for the men who experience it, it's often also not accompanied by fear for physical safety. Whilst some organisations will ignore a man's testimony and bellitle harassment, I hear of more where it's excused as \"boys will be boys\", though this is thankfully decreasing!\n\nAlthough a false accusation can destroy anyone professionally, it's only believable because of how common abuse is. There's also the culture of slut shaming which predominantly affects women.", "That\u2019s a fantastic idea, not everyone can afford mental health care.", "Wait until I tell you about all the baggage men bring to the office.", "What if she is, it's all booked but she was victimised last week? \n\nShould she not go to work?\n\nI think this is generally good advice personally to \"sort your shit out\" take back agency for yourself. But applied to other people who aren't a friend you're compassionately trying to help move on after time for healing, it's uncompassionate and victim blaming.", "Oh he is definitely NTA. I was just saying no one is perfect and sometimes our past comes out in the wrong way at the wrong time.  My only suggestion to OP would be designate a woman to invite or just ignore her complaints of not being invited.", "I agree with you. Yes, we women experience a lot of fucked up stuff but we can't start crying \"wolf\" whenever we see a man. At least not if we intend to actually work with them. \n\nI remember an old coworker that seemed somewhat mentally unstabile and was absolutely sure every man was trying to get in her pants. I don't mean to shame her but she was in her 50'ies and not exactly a supermodel so (speaking as a non-attractive woman in my 40'ies) the attraction wasn't usually overwhelming men and making them do stupid shit. It got so bad even her male manager ended up having the union present at every 1-on-1 meeting with her simply to have a pair of extra eyes and ears during every conversation. \n\nBeing defensive is one thing but when it turns to outright aggressive from the get-go, there will be problems in the workplace and the fallout usually goes to the aggressor - as it should. \n\nShe needs to get her shit worked out outside of work or find a female-only profession. This is really hurting herself.", "This isn't really the same situation, but women are killed at work. This past year a lady was killed in the Walgreens she worked at by a coworker. Work isn't automatically a safe place", "Plenty of women get stalked by coworkers who couldn't take no for an answer.", "Damn this comment needs to be higher. Most appropriate comment", "She should. She made a mistake, who is perfect \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "\u201cTHOUGHT\u201d he was going to ask her out. Hence her apology, because she realized he wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s unclear about this.", "Hanging out with people isn\u2019t the HR issue the commenter is talking about. It\u2019s that the new colleague has publicly said she thought OP was hitting on her.  Who knows what other sort of impropriety she may perceive and report to HR?  It\u2019s best for OP to get ahead of it and ensure HR is aware of the situation so that any potential complaints about OP are seen in context and not taken at face value.", "Is the OP really going over board in being polite but distant?  I see him as being cautious about a person who has already shown they jump to conclusions, which is I think reasonable. \n\nBut if you mean the board as going overboard? Probably,  but I think reddit is the most overreacting place in the world lol", "\"Go overboard\"...really? Literally his only reaction has been to continue doing his job, ie including her in the official events. So by not doing more than that, ie including her in unofficial events also, he is going overboard? Lol.\n\nAlso, the setting and context of the apology shows poor thinking at best. As soon as her keys were set down, she should have immediately apologized, not waited. Oh well, things happen. Once she realized she needed to apologize, she could have found OPs office, or called them, or emailed them with the apology: a *private* apology. But instead, she did it in a lunch area, with witnesses, and apparently in a way that way visible and audible enough to for people to overhear and question OP about it. That is like, the worst possible place/manner to apologize for a workplace foible like this: it was between them, and it could have stayed between them, but she brought it to other's attention. Which, honestly, sounds like what really caused OP to retreat from non-formal social interaction with her.\n\nEdit: one word", "Blocking you will improve my internet experience.", "Looks like your comment hit a little too close to home with the person you responded to.", "I think it's safe to assume that a company with a position like OP's likely has health insurance for staff.", "still doesn't mean you get to be an asshole to others. her past isn't her fault, yet her actions are under her control", "Doesn't her apologizing make any difference at all in this story?!", "Women are killed in their own home, ot doenst mean every woman should assume their partner is an abusive murderer.", "I agree but that's like saying that ppl are killed during daytime too so we should all shoot first and ask later. Honestly, especially as women we need to protect ourselves, not just from aggressors but also from crippling paranoia. This is hurting her.", "I'm not saying that there's no problem with that, but still how exactly this monologue before OP could even finish one sentence would help in that case?", "Perhaps she is in the habit of making social mistakes and that is the reason nobody is asking her out to lunch", "If your half apology about something that happened in private is in public, it\u2019s not an apology, it\u2019s a performance.", "She has a communication problem and your HR suggestion is over the top.", "I can understand OP keeping a distance, but the replies here are ridiculous.", "Your reply is the perfect example of what I'm talking about. Calm the fuck down; she fucked up, she apologized, OP accepted. Everyone else is now going more overboard than OP or the coworker.", "And this incident happened when she was new.  Even if they started health insurance one day one (unlikely) that is not enough time to go through years of baggage.", "To me it does. Especially doing it in public, honestly. I get why he didn't feel like that was giving her extra points but to me it does. \n\nBut ... I have a thing I say when ppl apologise and think it's all good now. If you slap a dog it'll still flinch every time you hand it a treat. You can't just undo a slap by handing out treats in the hundreds. It's the same with humans.", "No but the above commenter suggested work is inherently safe but it's not", "Made no comment on whether or not the subject was acting in a healthy way. Just pointed out that work isn't a guaranteed place of safety", "Lol, if you say so. You\u2019re overthinking it. When I apologize to someone at their desk, it\u2019s because I realized I was in the wrong and genuinely am sorry for doing so. Pretty sure there\u2019s no way she could have handled this situation that would be pure enough for you. If she pulled him into a room to talk alone, you\u2019d say that could be misconstrued as them having a workplace romance or something.\n\nIt\u2019s not a big deal.", "Yeah, but some of the responses on this thread make it seem like she intentionally tried to screw OP over when that's not the case. Or acknowledge that she even bothered to apologize. \n\nAnd we know if it was a man who apologized to a woman, she'd be encouraged to show him more grace onwards.", "Clearly you\u2019re under thinking.  So under-thinking in fact that you missed that this apology didn\u2019t happen at his desk, it happened at lunch, in front of a bunch of people.  Allegations even when stated or proven to be false, can still be damaging.\n\nThere is a way for the apology to be good enough, in private.  But thank you for telling me what my opinions are o\u2019 wise one."]}
