I said she was welcome and she left the lunch area but the people I was with all quizzed me about what that interaction was about - including my partner - so then I had to explain etc. They all understood but they did ask what I gonna do moving forward and I just said I'd give her some space. \nShe's not said a word to me since nor me to her, outside of group emails.\n\nAlso sorry if it seemed odd describing my role, I just thought it was important for context, if I worked in her department etc we'd be forced to work together but I'm on an entirely separate team and only really report (through my team leader) to the C level employees so there no real reason for her and I to need to interact if that makes sense?", "Sorry, can you clarify?", "Thanks for replying, sorry but \"doing it\", what exactly?\nI'm never ever rude or anything remotely like that, but I'm not sure what I'd apologise for?\nShe's on the team calendar for all events and anyone we hang with outside the office is free to invite her for lunch or our other activities. \nShe didn't feel comfortable enough to approach me about it so I don't wanna push for her to come in person and risk making things worse y'know?", "Can I ask, in what way was my description of myself a red flag?

But I think you being a key player in many of these out of work events has built a strong link in her mind between that rocky start and her perception of how you view her.

I'd keep my distance from her as well, if I were you.  \n\nOn the one hand, I fully agree with her desire to keep personal and professional lives separate.  You respect her desire to do this, so you obviously don't invite her to out-of-work functions.\n\nBut, then she complains that she's \"out of the loop\" on out-of-work functions.

First she made drama with the card thing, she could possibly make drama with the after work socializing if she is excluded.

Best of luck", "NTA. Maybe other people are not inviting her because they know something you don't know. What if she has done something similar to others? I doubt that her being iced out has anything to do with you. Continue to keep your distance.

She's made it perfectly clear that she's there to work, not socialize. Respecting her boundaries would absolutely not make him an asshole.", "Exactly. The assumption here seems to be \"she's a nice lady who's new and possibly a little embarrassed over accusing someone of hitting on her. Be nice to her.\"\n\nThat's not my read. I see a woman who intentionally made an innocent encounter very awkward, and instead of being contrite, goes running to her coworkers to complain OP is now leaving her out. She sounds manipulative and professionally dangerous to OP. \n\nKeep her at arm's length, OP. Never be alone with her. You're NTA.", "Edit: didn\u2019t realise how long that was! In short - I think there\u2019s definitely potential that she made a mistake, knows she got it very wrong, and has no way to rectify it herself without looking worse. \n\nI agree - I think she maybe had a previous experience that she projected and defaulted to \u2018keep work and personal separate\u2019 as a sort of gentle way to rebuff without offending, not necessarily that she actually doesn\u2019t ever want to interact outside of work. She clearly realised she got it very wrong and came to apologise and I feel like the continued deliberate lack of inviting her to the less work based social activities is almost becoming punitive - a little like malicious compliance for her incorrect assumption in the first place? \n\nShe\u2019s probably mortified that she jumped to a conclusion and now feels incredibly awkward in the office, knowing she\u2019s being left out of things, and doesn\u2019t really know how to start over and feel like any other part of the team. Another commenter said to maybe start slowly inviting her to a couple of things that aren\u2019t work social activities, even via your partner if there is still some awkwardness. I\u2019d make an attempt or two as you\u2019re obviously aware, and so are colleagues, that there\u2019s some tension there and she\u2019s not entirely comfortable at work. \n\nI think if you\u2019re not inviting her because she was erroneously trying to \u2018let someone down gently\u2019 by saying she doesn\u2019t mix work and personal then it\u2019s definitely worth bearing in mind that it may well have not been how she really felt and that she has no real course of action to \u2018reset\u2019 the dynamic because inviting yourself to things isn\u2019t appropriate. Even just a straight up conversation, with someone else there, to say that you know things started off awkwardly but would she like to be included may be worth trying?\n\nI get that she \u2018started it\u2019 and set the tone by the first interaction but, given how you describe yourself and the office dynamic, it just may be worth giving her a second chance. \n\nNAH, but I think it\u2019s worth trying to find out if her initial reaction was knee jerk or whether that\u2019s genuinely how she feels about out of work activities. Especially as colleagues have now approached you about it so it\u2019s probably quite noticeable.", "Why is the onus on OP to fix anything? He didn\u2019t cause the initial awkwardness and he\u2019s not the one who isn\u2019t inviting her to non work events. He is also not the one she is complaining to.\n\nOP is NTA", "She's new to their workplace and has already TWICE made allegations against OP. There's nothing to bridge. This woman is bad news.", "from my experience, canned replies from people mean they have some experience that made that canned reply happen. \n\nI've had one woman colleague, who was honest to god lusted after by half the people the company worked with - from clients, through suppliers to delivery drivers. one 'man' had the audacity to steal flowers her BF bought her earlier, and replace them with a box of candy he brought with him.", "Yeah but I can also see peoples reluctance to invite her out. It sucks that she\u2019s being iced out but some companies take harassment complaints seriously (as they should). If people are drinking, and she decides that someone is \u201chitting on her\u201d in a similar fashion to OP\u2019s key incident? No one wants to run the risk of being reported for something they didn\u2019t do. \n\nWe\u2019re in a recession right now. Socializing with someone who thinks people are making a pass at them isn\u2019t worth the risk of losing your job. I would give her another chance but I would make sure I\u2019d be extremely public and in mixed sex company for the purpose of having witnesses. Maybe she\u2019ll be cool, but I really understand why folks aren\u2019t chomping at the bit to befriend her.", "Just a thought, but have you raised this to HR?

OP is wondering if continuing to give her a wide berth and perhaps assuming other colleagues would invite her to outside of work events as a result is his asshole move. That happened after the apology and was making people wonder if he disliked the new hire (he admits to taking new hires out and giving them the lay of the land usually).", "Good thing they changed the definition of a recession to avoid it.", "I suggest that it be arranged through HR if they have an HR department/rep", "I understand, I don't see it as an interpersonal conflict since no one is complaining.

She's already made it clear that if any man goes up to talk to her, she will indirectly accuse him of workplace harrasment without letting him finish his sentence. \n\n\n\n\n2. She has yet to retract her statement of keeping her work and private live separate and ask to join in on work events, instead she's complaining to other coworkers about being \"iced out\" when they are honoring her request.

OP is NTA because while it is their job to organize work events, it isn't their job to find a bff for this worker.  She asked to keep it separate and now it is on her to find friends.  Has she asked anyone out to lunch or happy hour or does she expect everyone to go to her first?", "That's the same thing I was thinking. She asked to keep a professional only relationship with fellow employees and that's what everyone is doing. Brings to mind the old saying...... Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it!", "That's exactly what i am thinking.\n\nIt's not about OP being the social core of the group, but mostly because of how she reacted. Probably most guys are now guarded against her, since what she did could be very damaging for OP. \n\nSo just like that, in a balanced work enviroment she lost half of potential friends or acquaintances. \n\nShe nuked herself.", "Yes. A lasting first impression.", "Ditto. As I woman, I would be very leery of this person. Boundaries are reasonable but this seems more like someone stirring up drama. If she was that guarded about a friendly attempt to return her pass, I can only imagine potential issues that would arise from socializing with her outside of work.", "I've had creepy things like that happened to me when I was young. People just assumed that because I was lovely, I was also available and immoral. \n\nBy my count, I've been stalked by 15 different \"people,\" who thought that crawling all over my life was perfectly acceptable behavior. \n\nSome people thought I was cold and stuck up because I wasn't a flirt, and I maintained a business only attitude at work and school.\n\nNTA, OP, but I feel sorry for that poor woman who has to put up so many barriers between herself and the world just to survive.", "A guy I worked with - to whom I'd said maybe four sentences - emailed me to tell me he had received my subliminal messages, and that he would break up with his fiancee so we could be together.

I say this from experience.", "And it's not those people's responsibility to cater to the irrational emotions. He was polite, he continues to be polite.

Does she never expect to get approached by anyone ever at work?", "Lol, what safety? She was at the workplace, not in the dark alley to feel endengered. She didn't even let OP finish saying what broought him to her desk. How was he supposed to act to not make \"unsolicited approach\"? By making it about notallmen you only make this important slogan sound funny.", "Adding to this, it can be scary! What if when we offended him we got attacked or singled out. It\u2019s not even only about feelings! As you know", "Boundary that was not needed. The polite way is to let him finish and then say no. She was rude.

She interrupted OP to put a boundary in place about keeping work and personal life separate, which is a silly thing to do when she had no idea what OP was talking to her about, but also not the same as accusing him of anything. Then she explained her reasoning and apologised for misinterpretting- a silly thing to do in front of a bunch of coworkers, but again, not an accusation. \n\nShe obviously internally assumed that was what OP was doing, but she's within her rights to do that.", "Dude, OP just recently found out over workplace grapevine that she's been complaining to other coworkers she's upset that she's not being invited to non-office events, including OP's own private events with coworkers.\n\nNow OP had not invited her to his private events because she's made him extremely uncomfortable with her  unfounded and overly quick to judgement accusations of impropriety and publicly calling him on it with her public apology, forcing him to defend himself in public.  \n\nOP now is wondering if it's his fault that others have also not invited her to their private non-office events, that if maybe they're just following his behavior of not inviting her to his private events.", "She apologized, ffs.

And although all harassment is horrible, for the men who experience it, it's often also not accompanied by fear for physical safety. Whilst some organisations will ignore a man's testimony and bellitle harassment, I hear of more where it's excused as \"boys will be boys\", though this is thankfully decreasing!\n\nAlthough a false accusation can destroy anyone professionally, it's only believable because of how common abuse is.

I don't mean to shame her but she was in her 50'ies and not exactly a supermodel so (speaking as a non-attractive woman in my 40'ies) the attraction wasn't usually overwhelming men and making them do stupid shit.

Literally his only reaction has been to continue doing his job, ie including her in the official events. So by not doing more than that, ie including her in unofficial events also, he is going overboard? Lol.\n\nAlso, the setting and context of the apology shows poor thinking at best. As soon as her keys were set down, she should have immediately apologized, not waited. Oh well, things happen. Once she realized she needed to apologize, she could have found OPs office, or called them, or emailed them with the apology: a *private* apology. But instead, she did it in a lunch area, with witnesses, and apparently in a way that way visible and audible enough to for people to overhear and question OP about it. That is like, the worst possible place/manner to apologize for a workplace foible like this: it was between them, and it could have stayed between them, but she brought it to other's attention.

If you have a role to interact, fulfill that responsibility and move on; don't overthink whether this particular coworker has some randomly specific needs that must be met - probably best to just discuss with your boss, not the internet.\n\nI had a similar event happen years ago, that had a very awkward start but a very humorous outcome. A new female coworker, in an area that I would sometimes be reassigned to to cover vacations, looked very familiar - so I said as much (that's all I said). She immediately shut me down with a whole spiel about how that was a terrible line and how I needed to get better pickup material, etc, etc, etc. (she was mean about it too). Not even a week to the day, I run into a longtime female coworker friend (from my dept), who immediately runs up and gives me a hug, proceeding to tell her sister, who she has in tow, my life story and how a great a person I am - guess who the sister was. Yep, and to put icing on the cake... another close coworker friend of mine and a bunch of us went out to play pool after work that wknd. One of my friend's gf of 2 years, that I would have been meeting for the first time that night, was indeed the same girl that chastised me for simply saying she looked familiar. Her sister and bf both humbled her with their introductions and I left it at that... she did apologize the next day, I accepted, we eventually didn't work together anymore, end of story.\n\nI feel inclined to say no assholes here, but I'm still not sure what you think you did wrong.", "NTA.

She approached you about it publicly when doing so privately would have been the professional way to handle it. All it takes is one well-meaning person to misinterpret your friendliness toward her, and this could escalate quickly. Keeping your distance respects the boundary she set and also protects you.", "NTA and watch out.   She already seems like the type to lean towards sexual harassment over work issues.  That can go south real fast.\n\nAs a woman, I understand and agree to give her a lot of space", "NTA.

And she didn't complain about you, specifically; in fact, I'm not sure she was complaining, was she? If she was, send the person she complained to to approach her, on behalf of the team (\"since she is apparently more comfortable with you, let's...\") And while it was not particularly smart of her to approach you during lunch, it was the first break after the incident, so it makes sense; she meant well.

I'm not saying that's what is happening here, but I'm not seeing anything in OP's post to suggest that she has given any indication the new situation bothers her. \n\nOP is NTA, obviously.", "NTA - she made the mistake of thinking someone was going to hit on her, and got embarrassed.\n\nShe\u2019s probably the type you only want to be around when there\u2019s a group of people.\n\nAnd if she\u2019s getting all the emails inviting her to events, then nothing is stopping her from being invited, you don\u2019t need to personally invite everyone.\n\nAlso, it sounds like she\u2019s been complaining to other people in the company rather then speaking to a manager about it, which is pretty 2 faced.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I would do.\n\nDocument everything, how you went to give her her badge, how she approached you to apologise, how she\u2019s complained to other employees about you being cold, and how she\u2019s \u201cnot being invited to work events\u201d\n\nPull all social emails showing the email was sent to her.\n\nContact HR and then report her inappropriate behaviour.\n\nShe got embarrassed and is now creating a hostile work environment. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to work with someone like her.", "Wow okay, there's being cautious, and then there's assuming a new coworker is trying to ask you out just because he approached your desk. \n\nI'm wondering if OP was giving off some kind of vibes he wasn't aware of, but that seems weird if being social/friendly is literally part of his job description. \n\nAlso, seems a little weird that she's so keen to keep work and personal relationships separate and then wonders why no one asks her to join in on non-work social outings. \n\nIn any case NTA. If things are going to improve, I think it's on her to smooth things over. And OP can't do anything more than he has already to affect other people's behavior.", "NTA.

Even if the consequence was not what she intended, it was up to her to come to you and let you know that she didn't want to be that excluded from informal social interactions.\n3. She made an assumption the first time you tried to talk to her and cut you off. She is making an assumption about why she's being excluded and not talking with you about it, just complaining (and spreading her assumption) with other people. She isn't owning her role in why she's being left off of your informal invites. TBH, others are not intentionally copying you; they are probably just using a previous email chain you started that didn't include her. They can go to the trouble of adding her name to their own invites.\n4. There are three others also charged with office morale. Just ask them to make sure she is included on their informal invites. You can consider sending a general email to all - saying you want to clean up your email list and asking folks to confirm to you if they want to keep or remove their address from emails about unofficial office gatherings. You don't want to disturb anyone who doesn't want to receive those communications and don't want to omit anyone who does want to be included. You can also say that you will omit any names of folks that have not replied but they are free to send you an update at any time.

It was a member's only club, and a new girl came in and was pretty clearly drunk and having a freak out.  I asked if she needed help or if she was looking for someone, and she said she was a guest of a girl we'll call L. I told her L usually went to vape on the patio.  She asked me to walk her there, and then stopped as we were walking towards the side door to ask if I was just trying to get her alone where no one could hear her.  \n\nFreaked me right the F out, so I grabbed the door girl to watch the newbie.

Its normal for you to feel uncomfortable around her now, but seeing that she's comfortable setting clear boundaries I think this is something you should do too, rather than ignore the situation or exclude her.

It was way premature to cut him off and make that assumption, but it's not like she threw abuse at him or something. OP didn't describe her as being angry.\n\nPeople are viewing her apology as if it was an attempt to embarrass OP, but more likely she was oblivious to the awkwardness, or else wanted to apologize with people around because she's obviously apprehensive about interacting with men in the workplace. (I wouldn't be shocked if she has trouble with social cues due to either anxiety or just being socially awkward.)\n\nRegarding her response, it's also silly to take her words *literally* about keeping work and personal life separate. That was obviously her way of saying she didn't want to date coworkers, *not* a request to be snubbed in any and all gatherings outside of work. \n\nI'm going with NAH because it was a fairly minor misunderstanding that led to a little awkwardness in a couple of situations. I understand how OP felt about it, and I don't think he had any malice or wildly inappropriate reactions.\n\nThe coworker reacted in a comprehensible way, although clearly had the wrong idea. She is mot an AH because she apologized. It's too bad that only led to more awkwardness.\n\nI think a little more emotional intelligence on both sides could have kept this from being a further issue, but shit happens, and we're all imperfect.\n\nI will say, OP is kind of on the \"welcoming committee\" and should be ready to put a little more into resolving wrinkles like this with new hires (still wasn't AH behavior, though). For example, by not doing the usual informal lunch he does to show new hires around, he's treated his coworker in a significantly different way, which can absolutely affect her chances of success at the company. \n\nI would suggest low-key trying to include her in  things (as other commenters have said, maybe have someone else do it). OP might also consider writing an apology/damage control type email to help smooth things over. There is no need to take ownership of wrongdoing; the idea is more to acknowledge things got awkward and reiterate that neither party had ill will to help move past it.", "So, let's see. There was a misunderstanding,  for which she promptly apologized. As a result,  you decided to exclude her fom activities", "NTA. And maybe give her a little grace.

I agree with someone who said maybe have a conversation with her. Perhaps bring your GF of 4 years. Having a woman there could help her feel safe. Then have an honest conversation with her and make sure you are listening to understand and not to respond. Good luck and I hope it gets better for both of you.", "NTA, in any of kind of way.

I believe there is a large overlap in the kind of people who complain no one shows up to their baby shower with people who say they go out of their way to never make friends at work and keep it \"strictly professional\" and that work friends can never be \"trusted\".  Those people also tend to complain it's impossible to make friends as an adult.  OP's new hire sounds like one of these people.  I've worked with a few of these folks over the years.  My favorite is, let's call her \"Jane\" who would complain our boss \"Jimmy\" was sexist.  I'm also a woman and he hires more women than men and no one else thinks he is sexist.  Jane will call him sexist and then also complain Jimmy doesn't joke around and hang out with her because much like OP, she told him she wants to be professional at work.  It's not a very uncommon thing but I always find it a fascinating phenomenon.", "NTA- when she apologized publicly it sounds like she made herself look bad. People already know you and when you explained yourself, because she put you in that situation, they picked up on her attitude. They distanced themselves because they didn\u2019t want to be put in the same situation. Which is completely understandable. She has shot herself in the foot so to speak. This is on her, not on you. She needs to now try and repair the image of herself and it may just be that she needs to move on. More complaining from her is going to get her more of the same treatment. The more she complains the more people will back away. No one wants to touch the hot stove. They aren\u2019t going to want her around no matter how you try and force your team to be with her. Forcing doesn\u2019t work. She only has herself to blame. I would possibly speak to HR about this situation in case it escalates so they are aware of it. That way you\u2019re not going to be trying to explain yourself. It is odd that she assumed you were going to ask her out.", "NTA. Would\u2019ve done the same thing.

Would you say a woman is nuking someone's social life if she's distant from him after he did make a pass at her during his first week?", "The point that I was trying to make is that this woman, who seems to be awkward at best, jumped to conclusions about OP, and told him that she doesn't want to do anything but work and then complains about not being included in activities outside of work with the team. A lot of career networking is done outside of work for many industries, and women have experienced career delays because they weren't invited to play golf or go to clubs with management. She could complain that she is being excluded on a discriminatory basis, which could be detrimental to OP so I suggested that he go to HR.", "I don't think they are even understandable. You are in a new place of work, someone you do not know approaches your desk, and before they can say anything you are assuming they think enough of you that upon first laying eyes on you, want to ask you out. This seems like arrogance to me. Assuming someone that has not met you wants to date you, and assuming that you are the only one that keeps work relationships professional. I don't care what the past holds, you leave it in the past until someone gives you reason to bring it out. If not, you get excluded from events you wish to go to, and it has an effect on how others treat you.", "I can see both sides, just a bummer that one single isolated misunderstanding that she apologized for has likely destroyed her career. OP acknowledged that his distance and portrayal has had an effect on how the rest of the company treats her.\n\nI agree her action was bizarre- the trope is something that's happened to people I know irl, and was being used as a potential explanation for what she said, not agreement with it- but again, **one** misunderstanding that she apologized for, dang. The apology seems like the correct response to a mistake. \n\nI personally think taking it to HR, approaching him at his office (after tracking down where it is,) or requesting a private meeting would've opened them both up to serious accusations of misconduct, and she likely happened to see him at lunch right after the incident and tried to nip it in the bud and say it was her fault, she's so sorry for misunderstanding.\n\nMy workplace is totally great and friendly, there's just not many reasons for anyone to approach a brand new person at their desk. They won't know who they are lol. He could've given the keycard to security to give back to her, rather than track someone to their department. \n\nI hope she finds a workplace with understanding, professional coworkers, and I hope OP **never** says something that someone more important than him in the company assumes was malicious, lest they and their coworkers treat him how she's being treated, to protect themselves from the *dangerous* OP.  \n\nA healthy working environment means people can have misunderstandings or disagreements or even dislike each other without affecting someone's professional (aka friendly coworking) life with the rest of the office, or even each other. \n\nAll newbies make weird social mistakes, most company veterans then flashback to the dumb things they did as newbies and move on lol. If the offense was so great or illegal, that's grounds for disciplinary action or firing, not weird social games. \n\nOP isn't necessarily wrong for distancing *himself,* but the problems in this company run deeper than he's saying.", "I believe women are victims of work place harassment regularly.\n\nIf you\u2019re telling me that you regularly saw workplace harassment in the very first sentence out of someone\u2019s mouth, the first time they met someone, I\u2019m going to say that you\u2019re probably lying.", "Is the baggage you bring sexism? You must be fun to have as a colleague.", "What are you talking about?", ">Although a false accusation can destroy anyone professionally, it's only believable because of how common abuse is. \n\nThis doesn't mean OP should for whatever reason open himself up to complaints like this.", "I'm guessing your annoying by your comment alone.", "Booooo", "Or maybe they just don't want sexist, racist nonsense clogging up their inbox.  The world may never know.", "She\u2019s a psycho and her behavior is unacceptable in a professional environment \n\nDocument every interaction that you have with her in case she ever makes any false and potentially much more serious accusations against you. She is already starting to do that and will continue to escalate it \n\nTell your supervisor about your interaction with her \n\nSpeak to an attorney if it gets much worse\n\nDo not underestimate what someone like this is capable of", "Sounds like an \"all guys are creeps and need to leave woman alone\", just to turn around and complain that guys don't talk to her kind of girl. Toxic femininity at it's best.", "> She thick.\n\nAnd not in a good way", "I think people \u2013 quite reasonably \u2013 found her behavior off-putting and worrying. I mean, she started her first day by being unnecessarily prickly with you, then compounded her error with her apology. She effectively told the entire office that her \"is this person going to behave inappropriately\" meter is surrounded by an exceptionally sensitive trip wire, *and* that, when she later realizes that her flying leap down someone's throat was completely unwarranted, she'll \"apologize\" for it in a way that maximizes embarrassment and discomfort for the person she wronged. That's not exactly a great way to make new friends. People now eye her warily. They probably worry that almost any innocent word or gesture could wind up with them in front of HR accused of sexual harassment. That's certainly not your fault. Not only that, but if I had been sitting nearby and heard what she said when you approached her to return her key card, I would have assumed that she wasn't interested in making friends at work; I would have assumed she was there to work and work *only,* and that she would not welcome friendly chit-chat. (I'm a woman and straight, FWIW, so I wouldn't be asking her out, and I wouldn't have assumed she was saying that because she expected to be asked out; I would have assumed she was just cold.)", "> so she is probably being cautious\n\nBeing cautious doesn't involve premature accusations. It means ensuring you're not alone with people you don't trust and setting firm boundaries and if needed, reporting uncomfortable encounters to HR.", "Ive been hit on, s/a and harassed doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll automatically assume everyone is going to do it. I\u2019m weary and on guard about it, but I don\u2019t jump to conclusions", "Not just prickly, but accusations like that are dangerous.", "If she wants to socialize outside of work, she needs to be the one to reach out and invite people. She drew a hard boundary and people are respecting that boundary. If that boundary has changed it\u2019s up to her to communicate the change, either by expressing an interest in being invited out (\u201chey, can I come with you the next time you go out for lunch?\u201d) or by actually inviting others (\u201chey, I\u2019m going out for lunch, wanna come?).", "My husband used to work with a younger woman who was very pretty and large busted. So many guys she had to deal with were absolutely ridiculous.", "I like this suggestion. You should also ask for guidance from your supervisor. It's a reasonable approach to a confusing situation.\n\nNTA\n\nWhatever her deal is, she sounds like an, \"I hate drama... but ...\" sort of co-worker.", "That level of accountability only seems to extend to white cis males in today's society.", "Unfortunately some very innocent men, like OP, get to feel a little bit of the discomfort a lot of women feel all the time from their intentions being incredibly misconstrued. Women learn very early on that even the most superficial friendliness can lead to very uncomfortable if not blatantly unsafe situations where men interpret a simple greeting as some sort of invitation. \n\nOP got the backend of that stick. As long as men don\u2019t start to actually signal to other men that that kind of behaviour will cost them their social standings and friendship groups this will continue. \n\nIn this particular situation it seems to me like she in a sort of back handed way is trying to rectify the awkwardness created by her initial reaction to OPs initial contact with her. Maybe then OP could be generous enough to try and interpret her intentions with kindness.", "I don\u2019t allow anyone I work with access to my social media.   Mostly because I try to contain the snark at work.  More, because work is work and personal is personal and rarely is it a good idea for them to meet.", "She apologized publicly in a manner that would make people think he might have hit on her or done something wrong. She planted the seed that op could have done something. Op doesn't owe her anything and she made it very clear that she's only there for work, so why would she expect to be invited to something non work related?", "If she let him finish his sentence, she wouldn\u2019t have had to assume anything though.", "> get to feel a little bit of the discomfort a lot of women feel all the time from their intentions being incredibly misconstrued.\n\nTurnabout is not fair play here.

Is it a direct 1:1 danger that women deal with daily? Not even a little bit. But an accusation, or even the appearance of an accusation can lead to career ostracization and complete destruction of his career, and depending on how far the legs on the rumor get, can have ramifications in his personal life.", "I've seen the same thing happen.  A group of about a dozen employees were all hired within a 6 month period of time and they liked to socialize together outside work, including their SOs on most occasions.   One woman told the other new colleagues early on that she wasn't interested in joining them because her husband worked out of town and hanging out with a group that was primarily male would give the wrong impression.   They went along with her request and stopped inviting her.     \n\n6 months later she complained to their managers and HR that they were leaving her out and she felt socially isolated in the workplace as a result of them developing friendships outside of work.   HR told her it was none of their business, but her manager got upset and read the riot act to the other employees about how they needed to invite her to hang out with them to make her feel included.  \n\nThe other employees still went out and socialized together, they just stopped talking about it anywhere within *her* earshot.", "Exactly.

You can ride your excuse for an entire career then blame others when it falls short of what you thought it would be. I notice you have repeatedly made this statement.

I can assure you that neither is true.", "She wasn't there to make enemies over not getting an apology perfect to the standards of Reddit, either.", "I'm not talking about OP, I'm taking about everyone else, including Reddit, being more offended than OP over this.", "And I\u2019d be more understanding if she had approached him privately to apologize"]}
