We used to have a really cold, unwelcoming office and my team (4 of us altogether) we're brought on to improve morale so I'm not saying that to brag, it's literally part of my job description - organising events, fielding complaints and relationship dynamics, just generally making sure everyone is comfortable and happy.\n\nI'd like to say I'm pretty darn well liked and haven't seen any evidence to the contrary yet and this has spilled over into my life in general and I'm one of those \"always smiling\" types overall.\n\nReason I said this is because my colleagues have recently asked if I have a problem with our newest starter (31F). She works in sales and is a little quiet (most likely because she's new) but ostensibly nice from what I hear. I've not got anything against her personally per se but she's allegedly mentioned to my team, but not me, that she doesn't get invited to outside of work events (non official functions, parties, dinners etc. She's looped into all official events ofc) or invited out to lunch at all and spends a lot of time alone in and around the office.\n\nI admit to giving her a wide berth but that is just because during her first week before we'd been introduced, I was getting onto the elevator and noticed someone had dropped a key card in the lobby, I recognised her face and approached her at her desk when I got to our floor, she looked apprehensive about me approaching so I slapped on a smile and went to speak. I just got out an \"excuse me but I think--\" before she interrupted with what sounded like a pre prepared speech about how she wants to keep work and personal life separate and didn't wish to engage unless it was work related. I didn't say anything and just placed her card on her desk and left it at that.\n\nShe approached me at lunch that day to apologise and said she thought I was asking her out, but did so in front of a crowd of people to whom I then had to explain myself. Overall she made me uncomfortable and feel guilty for being friendly, so I tend to follow her rules and only send her emails in group threads.\n\nBut seeing as I'm something of a social hub in/outside of work, this had apparently had a knock on effect of others kind of distancing themselves too.\n\nSo, AITA for following her ROE?\n\nP.S.

I would say invite her or have people invite her but keep the convo to a minimum as to not have her come up with the weird \u201coh he wants me\u201d thing or maybe invite your partner along so she can tell you\u2019re in a committed relationship. If non of those sounds appealing just have a discussion on how that made you feel and that you\u2019re just apprehensive but do so around a witness so she doesn\u2019t switch around and paint you in a bad light", "NTA. She\u2019s already made things weird and shown that she misinterprets completely innocuous interactions. I don\u2019t blame you at all for giving her a bit of a swerve. I think most people have a pre-prepped \u2018Thanks, but no thanks\u2019 response for being asked out but you do need to wait for the person to ask in the first place before launching into it\u2026", "NTA", "NTA. you got off on the wrong foot because of a misunderstanding on her part. She may have apologized for it, but after that, did she make any effort to be social and friendly towards you and the other colleagues? Did she ever initiate something social? If not, that's on her, you have done nothing wrong.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH or maybe soft YTA. The way she acted was definitely weird and uncalled for, but it sounds like she reacted that way because she had some creepy experiences with coworkers at previous jobs. Either that, or she\u2019s a bit socially awkward, or both. I don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve taken it personally, because she clearly wasn\u2019t trying to be rude on purpose. \n\nIn addition, the way you describe yourself as a personality hire feels a little weird. Did you just stop being friendly to her altogether after you had that interaction? It seems like she\u2019s been getting along with other coworkers just fine. Is there a chance you may have misinterpreted the interaction you described above? It really seems like it to me.", "NTA", "There's no conflict here", "NTA but in the future that get like any other coworker as best as possible. Good for you for caring and making your workplace more fun", "I'd say NTA as of now but if you keep doing it knowing she wants to be invited Y..T..A.   I'd apologize and tell her you're just careful with new hires because you don't know how involved they want to be outside of work. Some people actually don't want that.", "NTA but man, what an awkward situation! Be nice to her, starting a new job sucks. She was probably just nervous, tried to make it right, and made it even worse. She's feeling like an idiot, I assure you. If it happened to me, I'd introduce myself, shake her hand, and say 'Let's start this professional relationship over on the right foot.' And move on. Good luck!

Her apology in front of others was inconsiderate, quite rude actually. The fact that she is winging now that you are not inviting her to outside work get togethers is absurd - actions have consequences. You are NTA.", "ESH. You have a very high opinion of yourself and I think you don\u2019t want anyone to interfere with that image. Your coworker jumped to conclusions and kind of made a fool out of herself. You focus on socializing as a means of creating a better working environment but I think what you all need is to learn to communicate better and be inclusive.", "NTA ~ she said she was there for work and not to entertain social whims. She made it weird and she's getting what she asked for. If she hadn't made her clumsy apology so awkward and public, you wouldn't have been grilled to relay every detail of that initial interaction, and the team wouldn't have ever known she expressed this sentiment. \n\nIt's on her to fix, and frankly whining to others about it isn't such a hot look either.", "I was pretty surprised when she said that too, as far as I'm aware she'd already met my partner and we were sat next to each other, maybe I took for granted that most people knew we were together?\n\nI told the rest of my team when asked that I don't have a problem with her and hope she's not being excluded because anyone thinks they're doing me a favour or something.", "In all fairness, no she did not reach out to myself. I'm not sure about other colleagues but I don't think so, it's probably more difficult now it's been some time and numerous out of office events she's not attended", "Thanks for responding. \nI wouldn't call myself a personality hire tbh I have a similar personality to those in my department (2 women and another guy) but I don't think I misinterpreted, I figured she was nervous for whatever reason but sensed I had somehow made her uncomfortable so I just gave her her card, kinda nodded and backed off.\nShe approached the table I was sat with at lunch and essentially what she said was \"thanks for my card, sorry if I seemed snappy earlier, I thought you were gonna ask me for a date\". I said she was welcome and she left the lunch area but the people I was with all quizzed me about what that interaction was about - including my partner - so then I had to explain etc. They all understood but they did ask what I gonna do moving forward and I just said I'd give her some space. \nShe's not said a word to me since nor me to her, outside of group emails.\n\nAlso sorry if it seemed odd describing my role, I just thought it was important for context, if I worked in her department etc we'd be forced to work together but I'm on an entirely separate team and only really report (through my team leader) to the C level employees so there no real reason for her and I to need to interact if that makes sense?", "Sorry, can you clarify?", "Thanks for replying, sorry but \"doing it\", what exactly?\nI'm never ever rude or anything remotely like that, but I'm not sure what I'd apologise for?\nShe's on the team calendar for all events and anyone we hang with outside the office is free to invite her for lunch or our other activities. \nShe didn't feel comfortable enough to approach me about it so I don't wanna push for her to come in person and risk making things worse y'know?", "Can I ask, in what way was my description of myself a red flag? I was just trying to give some context regarding my role in the office and my general demeanour. Sorry if you got the wrong impression.", "Thanks for replying.\nI wasn't describing myself that way to be self congratulatory for what it's worth. If someone did find me such in the office I'd work to present myself differently, I try to communicate and code switch according to people's personalities which is why I'm giving her space.\nCould you perhaps recommend a different tact or a way to communicate better?", "When it comes to social gatherings among coworkers, would you say you organize a lot of those gatherings? If so, do you invite her?\n\nIf not, then I\u2019m confused about why this is a conflict/why you\u2019re in the center of it. Have your coworkers questioned other people about their relationship with her, or just you?", "This sub is to judge interpersonal conflict, I don't see one here. She misinterpret your approach then apologized, end of the story", "Giving her a wide birth and not inviting her to group stuff outside of work. She's expressed an interest and is nice. I'd say you handled it perfect as of now giving new people space is often a good idea as a lot of times it can be overwhelming starting a new job.", "It\u2019s probably a personal thing. In my experience people that claim something like \u201cI am pretty darn well liked\u201d / \u201cI\u2019m the funny one and always entertain a group\u201d / \u201cI am a deep talker\u201d tend to have weird self awareness. I think people shouldn\u2019t claim something like that, especially because evidence that contradicts these views is most likely discarded due to wide spread cognitive biases.", "We have office events (drinks, sporty stuff like dodgeball, Xmas and Summer parties) that my team plans and organises entitely and put them on a group calendar for the whole company so people can RSVP at will (up to like 2 weeks before the event depending on venue and stuff).\nOutside of that I am pretty friendly with most of the company, partially due to being a go-between for higher ups and other departments, partially due to my partner having worked there too so we've got a pretty integrated social group.\n\nOutside of work events we do do like drinks or dinner at someone's house and events like concerts or sports matches and stuff but those are organised outside the office by myself, my partner and like 2 others but usually they're well attended.\nI've not personally invited her, no, but people can also invite who they like, it's not a guest list or invite only kinda thing mainly.\nFor example we did poker at a coworkers parents place last week (rich folks who live out of the country and have a huge house here) with some swimming/other stuff for those who don't play, about 15 of us were there I think?\nMight be the event that pushed her to complain cos I saw a lot of pictures being taken and presumably some would've been uploaded to SM, she does have some people on insta I'm pretty sure \ud83e\udd14", "Ah I see, makes sense to feel things out sure but normally I'll ask the new hires to lunch within the first couple of days to show them good places nearby to eat and introduce them to the team informally if and when I can.\n\nSorry, did you edit your comment btw? There was a bit about inviting her out I wanted to address a bit more in depth, like how to do that lol", "I understand where you're coming from, I think I just wanted to preempt any assumptions that I was something of a flirt or a 'lad' or anything. I think people seem to like me because I'm open and smiley/non threatening but I totally get what you mean, I'll work on that!\n\nETA I'm not that funny or too much of a deep talker (much to my chagrin) I'm more of an active listening type with the occasional dad joke and odd fact thrown in lol", "NTA. But I think you being a key player in many of these out of work events has built a strong link in her mind between that rocky start and her perception of how you view her. Does your partner have a connection with her? You mentioned they share a space? Perhaps on a future non work social event you can have your partner extend an invite on both of your behalf? Something like \u201chey, Own Art and I are getting together with some of the team at XYZ Grill, we would love if you could attend!\u201d"]}
