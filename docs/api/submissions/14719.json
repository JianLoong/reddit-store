I would have told them to fuck off too. Especially after physically taking off my headphones. \n\nLet them cry to HR. They physically touched you.

Is this the first incident?", "NTA apparently I'm in the minority here, but there's no way I'm not freaking out if someone puts their hands up to my head like that. Apologise anyway because most people aren't going to see it that way. Let them know that you're sorry for reacting so strongly, but that it wasn't acceptable to touch you without your consent. Tell them that you appreciate that they were concerned and trying to include you, but you are comfortable in your own company and they don't need to be concerned.", "NTA. People need to understand that nobody owes them interaction. They touched you and you responded.", "YTA. Being introverted does not excuse you from terrible behavior in the workplace. It wasn't okay for your co-worker to take off your headphones, I'll agree with you on that, but your reaction was *way* out of line.

It's your property, and you have the right to be plenty mad.  \nWhile I do sympathize with you because I know that we introverts don't really like to talk and all, but what you said and did was incredibly rude, totally not the right way to go about it.", "YTA. They were trying to be inclusive.\nUnless you had previously established some boundaries, where you all agreed to leave you out of things. you absolutely owe her and your other coworkers an apology.  You\u2019re owed an apology for having your personal space violated, and you can ask for that it\u2019s not unreasonable.\n\nLikely won\u2019t have to worry about the boundaries going forward though", "NTA\n\nYou were assaulted. Go to HR.", "NTA, I get freaked the fuck out when people touch me. My wife is fine but anyone else and I'm upset as hell. They shouldn't have touched you and you will probably need to report it and try to get ahead of the narrative they're going to push.", "ESH. You were very rude, could definitely have handled it with more class. I get that you don\u2019t like to socialize. But may I point out that some introvert enjoys socializing? Yes in shorter doses but we do. I often go and hang out for a while at work social functions and then I leave. \nThis isn\u2019t just because you\u2019re an introvert.\n There\u2019s something deeper going on.\n  She was annoying for yanking off your headphones.

Like others mentioned, people have lost their jobs for less and if this person felt like it, this could be a huge HR problem, and you\u2019d be lucky to receive a slap on the wrist. Yeah you don\u2019t have to like you\u2019re coworkers, but you do need to be respectful and keep the peace.\n\nYou\u2019re right that the coworker shouldn\u2019t have pulled your earbuds out, that kind of action is irritating at most. But your reaction was a bit too much. Maybe they were trying to get your attention for a while and thought that was the only way to grab it. It was a serious misstep, but I feel like even if they just tapped your shoulder you would\u2019ve reacted similarly. If you can\u2019t handle an environment that puts you around other people, or work as a team, do yourself and everyone else the favor, eliminate the stress and find a remote job.\n\nEdit: misspelled a word, just fixing it.", "They did not have the right to put their hands on you or your things by taking your headphones off but when someone ask you a question it\u2019s is in fact rude to answer fuck off.

YTA", "Soft ESH, edging on NTA imo, as I get being an introvert myself and do the same thing at social events but responding with fuck off immediately is a little aggressive but you coworker is a massive asshole for physically removing your headphones and questioning you for a perfectly normal thing to do. I hate when people try to get my attention while I have my headphones in, let alone when they try to physically remove them. Last time it happened, I was on the school bus home and a bit kept trying to take them so I warned him that I would bite him if he did it again. He did so I bit him.

She walked up to you, invaded your personal space and removed your headphones all without consent which was beyond rude. I have no idea why some people think that it\u2019s okay to just walk up to a person and invade their personal space/put their hands on them to get their attention. That behaviour is not appropriate end of story.", "ESH but you more than the coworker. Like far more. If I told a coworker to fuck off I'd probably be fired on the spot but I also work in a very professional environment. Don't be surprised if you go in to work on Monday and there are repercussions for what you did.", "ESH, I'm introverted as well. But that doesn't mean you can be rude. Be professional and polite.  Apologize.", "YTA.  While your coworker shouldn\u2019t have removed your head phones, you could have easily addressed her in that it wasn\u2019t ok and a quick explanation that events make you uncomfortable.  I\u2019m also an introvert but I do understand manners and you flew off the handle.  If she complains that you told her to fuck off and caused a scene/fight - there is potential for additional administration problems in your future.", "NTA - touching you without your consent is wrong. she should have kept her hands to herself and minded her own business.", "Info: is it normal in your work culture to drop f bombs.\n\nTbh, if a coworker touched me or my headphones, I'd go nuts too.", "NTA but you need to go to HR about your coworker putting their hands on you. Which make no mistake, someone physically taking your headphones off your head is putting their hands on you. Also, they interrupted your work to start an argument with you, which is not appropriate either.", "NTA. Physically removing your headphones was not ok.   It sounds like you responded to her surprising you with an immediate physical.  It may have gotten out of hand.  How do you feel about the situation?  This is what matters.  \n\nMy guess is that you don't want to socialize but you also want an environment where you each respect each other.  This is absolutely ok.  What about doing something like bringing in doughnuts or special pens for the team and tack on a note saying something like 'I reacted when someone got physical with me and put me out of my comfort zone.  I just want to say that I do appreciate all of you.  I'm just quiet..normally :-)  Please enjoy these doughnuts'.  This would let you to address it without being confrontational.  You can also speak with HR and ask for their help to navigate.", "NTA.  Your co worker assaulted you (in some parts of the world the police would give them a warning), by taking your headphones off, an argument is the least of her worries,", "YTA. Yes, your coworker should not have messed with your headphones. But your reaction was completely over the top. Instead of telling her, \"Please don't touch me,\" your respond with the F-bomb. Seriously, I'd fire you.", "ESH - but only for how you reacted. \n\nAs an ambivert: \n\nThese people that think social interaction beyond job duties is valued or necessary in the workplace need to get a grip on their own self importance. \n\nPolish your resume, find a better job.", "YTA\u2026. I totally get not wanting to socialize, and I totally get not wanting someone to take your headphones off because that\u2019s totally disrespectful.\n\nBut you didn\u2019t have to tell them to fuck off\u2026 you essentially just did an eye for an eye. Your reaction made the whole situation worse. \n\nYou could\u2019ve said hey, please don\u2019t take my headphones off again. And as for the how come, you don\u2019t like to socialize a simple that\u2019s just how I am is sufficient. And if they push it literally just repeat yourself that\u2019s just how I am. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to defend why do you like being antisocial. Repeating yourself by the way, it is called the broken record method. It\u2019s some thing I learned in therapy. \n\nYour coworker may have just been trying to include you sometimes extroverts try to adopt introverts it\u2019s really common. So I would give the benefit of the doubt that they were just trying to be nice to you, but went about it in a distasteful way for you. \n\nI would apologize if I was you about your reaction, but still stay at your boundaries about how you don\u2019t want your headphones taken off your head like that. And if she brings up the why don\u2019t you socialize you can just say I\u2019m an introvert. \n\nTwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right.

Boss said that I come across as unfriendly. I pointed out that I attend all the monthly birthdays, the pot lucks, and the after work socials. I just prefer to actually work when I\u2019m at work instead of standing around chit chatting all day. Boss refused to remove it from my review, even though they didn\u2019t know how I could fix it.", "NTA.  Don't believe the people here who say otherwise.

You should be the one complaining about her.", "ESH leaning towards YTA. She shouldn\u2019t of taken your headphones off and you shouldn\u2019t unnecessarily swore at her.  This could cost you your. Apologize to her though. Being an introvert isn\u2019t an excuse to do this.", "Yeah YTA I think you are the most standard definition of an asshole. I\u2019d worry about getting fired because I don\u2019t know how many bosses will be cool with that attitude.

Go on lunch break and leave the building. Take a half day. I\u2019m like you in that I am there to do my work and go home.

I am the kind of people who go to work, do what they\u2019re supposed to do, and come back home with the least possible human interactions. Last night, my coworkers had a birthday party. As I said I don\u2019t like these kinda stuff so I wore my headphones and kept focusing on my work. Then all of a sudden one of my coworkers came to me, took off my headphones and asked me why don\u2019t Ilike to socialize with people? I told her to fuck off and that it was none of her business. What she did was rude so we got into a heated argument. It was bad , like really bad but it did not get physical. \n\nI dont have a shift until Monday but I am scared about whether I should apologize to her and the team or if I should go and pretend like nothing happened?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
