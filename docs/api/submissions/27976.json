I don't see a point in marriage if I love and want to be with someone then that's all I need. She wanted it so I eventually proposed with what I believe to be a nice ring 2.5 carat  solitare round cut ring. So the fact that she did want marriage but now won't wear her engagement ring is weird to me.\n\nSo this has been an issue for me and an almost daily argument. I proposed to my GF on our 4yr anniversary she said she loved the ring and we almost got it stuck on her finger. \n\nAfter that we had to have it resized twice no big deal and the last time she said it fit great and she loved it. I asked if she was sure at pick up and she confirmed it was good. \n\nNow 5 months after our anniversary she still isn't wearing the ring. Her reason keeps changing from \"I don't like to wear rings, I'm not used to wearing rings, I don't want to ruin it at work, I don't want to scratch my face at night,  now it's back to it doesn't fit right.\" \n\nThis is really bothering me because I spent a decent chunk on the ring and would like to see her at least wear it. I even bought some silicone rings for her to wear so that she can get used to wearing a ring without all the other worries listed above.  However she still isn't wearing them. I keep bringing it up that I expect/would like her to wear a ring. Either silicone or her real one.\n\nI told her if she doesn't start to wear it (never set a date or deadline) then I'm going to sell it and we can use the money for something else. Apparently I'm an asshole being weird and controlling because I want her to wear a ring or at least not let a expensive one sit in a drawer.\n\nEDIT PS: she said  I cannot sell her ring because it was a gift to her but still won't wear it. I forgot to add that she does not want me to sell the ring.", "created_utc": 1696123819, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wo2cb/aita_my_fiance_wont_wear_her_ring/", "score": 337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not wearing a hella expensive flashy ring that makes me feel like I'll get mugged, or i lost a ring the size of a downpayment on a condo/townhouse/car/whatever if i lost it. And if my fiance missed all the signals that this ring is TOO MUCH for me,  I'd be pissed -- but I'd also feel really ungrateful and like I could not dare say that outloud because he really tried to impress me and go all out. i don't even think I'd wear a 2.5 carat CZ either,  over safety or flashy issues.", "She's being weird. There's a real reason she's not telling you. Maybe she doesn't like the design or maybe she's having cold feet.

Did she pick the setting, the stone, the size, the color? I personally think both people should shop together because it\u2019s such a long-term gift.

If not, the relationship could be the problem.\n\nNot wanting to wear a ring all the time is fine if she hates jewelry. I hate hats. But she should wear it sometimes if it is important to you.

You've been arguing with her over the jewelry she wears every single day for the past 5 months? Dude.\n\nYour fiancee was a bit inconsiderate in letting you buy an expensive ring she didn't intend to wear; she should have discussed it with you beforehand so you could have planned accordingly. I'm married and feel the same as your fiancee, so I told my husband to not bother buying a ring in the first place. But constantly picking fights about it makes it YTA for me.", "NAH but I do have some advice. For someone who \"doesn't care about marriage\", you are oddly obsessed with your partner wearing her ring every second of the day. You should let it go.\n\nThere's a few reasons she could not be wearing her ring:\n\n1. Wearing rings gives her sensory issues. I have ADHD and wearing rings bother me when I get overestimulated. It's hard to explain, but it's another sensory stressor that makes you painfully aware of the sensations of wearing a ring.\n\n2. She is just not used to wearing rings and often forgets to wear them because she's not used to it. No matter how many comments you make, she could immediately forget. It's common with people with ADHD/short term memory issues stemming from trauma, etc\n\n3. She doesn't like the ring. An engagement ring is a big deal to a lot of people and it's quite literally an advertisement of \"I'm taken\" to others. That being said, if you got a ring just to get a ring and didn't do any research to her likes, she just may not like the ring. That doesn't mean she wants it sold, because it's still an emotional gift from you. \n\nWhatever the reason may be, you need to let this go. Of all things you could be arguing about daily, you're choosing to argue over a piece of jewelry. If you're really the kind of person who doesn't need a ring or marriage to be content with your life partner, you need to truly be living like that and not causing unnecessary stress for your partner.\n\nPeople who truly love each other don't argue over wearing rings because they both know their bond is strong regardless of the advertisement they make to everyone else.", "Info : do she working in medical, food making or mechanic job where ring is not allow for safety and hygiene reason, or working on something that require lot of hand mobility like artist", "Have her pick out another delicate, small ring that is less expensive. There are a lot of beautiful options on etsy. Most married women I know have a smaller, lighter, less expensive band/ring that they wear often bc even if they LOVE their ring sometimes wearing a big diamond ring IS cumbersome, heavy, uncomfortable depending on the task, catches on things, makes someone anxious they'll mess it up or lose it, and also they are uncomfortable showing off something fancy in their line of work/could be alienating to clients. A silicone ring is ugly. If she doesnt bite at a dainty, delicate gold or silver ring, then there's a problem. Dont frame this gift in a negative way. Just say I really want something that you'll love and is more comfortable.", "NTA.  Take the ring back and move on before more mistakes are made.", "NTA. the fact that she won't wear a silicon ring makes it seem like it's not the size or style of the ring that is the problem. Maaaaybe she thinks 2.5 carats is too big for her to wear out, but then she could wear the silicon ring or ask for a smaller diamond.", "ESH yall need to communicate. Please for the love of all that is holy have an actual conversation with one another, and I suggest it be mediated or that you guys go to counseling. I\u2019m sure both of you have valid reasons for your feelings, but you guys need to hear each other instead of just bickering about the ring. \n\nBut as a side note, they make necklaces that have little ring holders on them. Maybe that would be a compromise for you both.", "ESH - a ring is a conditional gift, if you don't get married it's returned to you. If you decide you want to end the engagement, it's returned to you. It's not hers to tell you what to do with until she marries you.\n\nShe has either lost the ring and doesn't want to tell you or you have dropped a decent chunk of money on someone who used it to shit test your wallet. Either way...", "YTA\n\nHas she ever been someone that wears a lot of jewellery?  If not, maybe she's just someone that doesn't like it?\n\nShe may not like the feel of a ring on her fingers and there's no reason to make her wear a silicone ring to 'get her used to it'.    She could wear a ring on a necklace... but she may not like wearing necklaces and if it breaks, then it might be gone forever if she doesn't notice it's broken.\n\nAlso where does she work?  Showing up to work with such a showy ring can scream you have money.. depending on your work, you could have undesirables follow you to your car to get it.. or follow you home to break in when you aren't home because if you have an expensive ring, you mush have other expensive things in the house.  Also occupations matter when it comes to rings... if you're someone that needs to wear gloves ie nurse, beautician, vet, dishwasher, cleaner etc... well a big solitare ring like that will get stuck on the gloves.  You could also cause damage to someone if you are providing personal care ie scratch a resident at the aged care facility as you help attend to their daily needs.\n\nThe ring likely means a lot to her... but she may just struggle with the feel of it from a sensory perspective.  If it is, then I know how she feels because I'm the same.  I'm not any less married whether I wear my ring or not.", "INFO: are you planning on actually getting married, or did you just give her the ring to stall her inevitable departure? \n\nbecause it kind of reads like the latter, in which case i can\u2019t blame her for not wanting to wear it", "As a large solitaire ring, it may need a wedding band soldered onto it, to keep it from spinning/slipping down to sit under her finger (under her palm).\n\nThis is what happened with my 3.5ct ring. It was uncomfortable and I was always futtzing with it.\n\nOnce we were married, and I added my wedding bands to it, it stayed put. \n\nYour issue doesn't sound like a ring issue.

Maybe come up with a compromise, like, she wears it (when she remembers) when you guys are on a date, because when she wears her ring, it makes you feel super loved.\n\nThis is just one of many arguments and difficult conversations you two will have in your lifetime together, it\u2019s a good one to start with. \n\nCompromise is important, even if she *really* doesn\u2019t want to wear it, maybe she would in some situations if she realize how it hurts your feelings when she doesn\u2019t.

Which makes you the AH.\n\nAnd lastly because you need to have a mature discussion rather than picking a fight _every day_ over this. There could be plenty of reasons why she doesn\u2019t want to wear it - and in fact she\u2019s given you several, you just don\u2019t like them.\n\nWearing a ring when you don\u2019t normally wear one can be weird, especially gemstone rings that aren\u2019t just flat all the way around (when they inevitably twist around your finger they dig into you), and some people just do not like the feeling, maybe your partner is one. Maybe she\u2019s stressed out with all the times she needs to take it off, and is worried she\u2019ll lose or damage it. Maybe she doesn\u2019t actually like it and is afraid of hurting your feelings - you said she didn\u2019t want to buy a different one, but it could be her \u201cdream ring\u201d is not in a reasonable price range and she knows it. Or maybe she\u2019s never dreamed of wearing an engagement ring - some married people (in places where it\u2019s traditional to wear rings) don\u2019t wear any rings at all.\n\nOr maybe it is still the wrong size - fingers change size throughout the day, in different seasons, and with different levels of hydration.

She may genuinely love the ring and likely even thought she'd get used to wearing it but then realized that it's overstimulating or uncomfortable to wear.

At the same time, I never wear any jewelry. I only wear screw back stud earring because they don\u2019t get in the way and an Apple watch. I dunno. You guys need to have a heart to heart.

It sounds like a lovely ring but a big solitaire isn't some women's style - then again if that were the case she could have told you \"I love the ring but it's not something I would wear daily, let's trade it for a style that's more me\".   \n\n\nHer excuses seem strange and you're right something else is going on.

I hate how tight it is when my finger swells.  I hate having to worry about damaging it at work. It just causes stress.

They are made to be removed when sleeping and also when they can interfere with certain activities that might damage them.  My fianc\u00e9 bought me antique 1 karat platinum diamond ring.

I don't see a point in marriage if I love and want to be with someone then that's all I need. She wanted it so I eventually proposed with what I believe to be a nice ring 2.5 carat  solitare round cut ring. So the fact that she did want marriage but now won't wear her engagement ring is weird to me.\n\nSo this has been an issue for me and an almost daily argument. I proposed to my GF on our 4yr anniversary she said she loved the ring and we almost got it stuck on her finger. \n\nAfter that we had to have it resized twice no big deal and the last time she said it fit great and she loved it. I asked if she was sure at pick up and she confirmed it was good. \n\nNow 5 months after our anniversary she still isn't wearing the ring. Her reason keeps changing from \"I don't like to wear rings, I'm not used to wearing rings, I don't want to ruin it at work, I don't want to scratch my face at night,  now it's back to it doesn't fit right.\" \n\nThis is really bothering me because I spent a decent chunk on the ring and would like to see her at least wear it. I even bought some silicone rings for her to wear so that she can get used to wearing a ring without all the other worries listed above.  However she still isn't wearing them. I keep bringing it up that I expect/would like her to wear a ring. Either silicone or her real one.\n\nI told her if she doesn't start to wear it (never set a date or deadline) then I'm going to sell it and we can use the money for something else. Apparently I'm an asshole being weird and controlling because I want her to wear a ring or at least not let a expensive one sit in a drawer.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wore the ring with him but not when I was at work etc because I didn't want to lose my job (he lived far away so obviously I would have had to move away) and I didn't  actually like the ring - something I didn't tell him, even though it was nothing like any of the rings I had shown him previously that I liked. I didn't realise myself at the time that the reason I didn't wear it was that I didn't actually want to marry him anymore, and not liking the ring should have been a sign as I would have loved it if I had wanted to marry him, just as I loved every gift however small he had given me before then.

So it\u2019s fair for you to ask her to wear some type of ring especially if you are wearing one as well.

There is **so** much benefit to looking out for yourself or you and your partner **before** there are major issues, but we as a whole, tend to see therapy of any kind as an \"after the damage is done\" problem.", "Pointless means pointless lol. It means he thinks it's pointless. If his fiance just now realized that after he wasn't entirely excited to get married, then that could be a reason why she isn't wearing the ring. Obviously somethings wrong.", "1 out of 195 countries with a unique culture does not represent the world at large, especially one where materialism is rampant\n\na huge part of proposals is the surprise", "> Her reason keeps changing from \"I don't like to wear rings, I'm not used to wearing rings, I don't want to ruin it at work, I don't want to scratch my face at night,  now it's back to it doesn't fit right.\" \n\nIMO that is clear communication, all of those are part of the same reason, she\u2019s not used to wearing an engagement ring. \n\nHaving something overtly expensive and sharp that you\u2019re you\u2019re not used to on your finger can be stressful and uncomfortable. Would you feel 100% comfortable walking around with $1000 in cash on display around your neck? \n\nShe\u2019s worried she\u2019ll ruin it at work *because she\u2019s not used to casually carrying around something very expensive*.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t like rings *because it\u2019s not something she\u2019s used to wearing everyday*.\n\nShe\u2019s worried she\u2019ll scratch her face at night (surely everyone can accept that as a valid reason on its own, why does OP even care if she\u2019s wearing it to bed or not?).\n\nIt doesn\u2019t fit right *it doesn\u2019t feel right because she\u2019s not used to wearing rings. Also because finger size changes with the seasons, it\u2019ll be tighter in the summer and looser in the winter*.", "She was probably being polite, knowing he hated the whole process", "Then she should talk and not make excuses. Doesn\u2019t make the AH.", "You don\u2019t know the culture in every country my dude. Arranged marriages aren\u2019t surprises for example. Stop speaking for other cultures, you only have experience in your own, just like you\u2019re telling me", "alright now put it on a necklace and see her not wanna wear it \ud83d\ude2d", "Be polite... And ruin your chances of getting married bc your partner feels as tho you don't like letting people know you're married... Very very good logic", "You cherry picked the most materialistic culture in human history for an example then immediately jump to arranged marriages\n\nyou're silly"]}
