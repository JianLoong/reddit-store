Our friends come from careers where it's okay to be tatted.  So of course everybody in the bridal party is inked.  \n\nOne of my bridesmaids, Corrin, is a diehard Harry Potter fan and has a full sleeve themed around it.

However, her brand of social justice is \"if I think it's offensive, then you're not allowed to have it anywhere where I can see it.\" Which is counterproductive if you ask me.\n\nKelly made a big stink about Corrin's tattoos and told me that she has to get them covered up.  I told her that it's not going to happen for multiple reasons.  Namely, if one bridesmaid has to cover up her tats then so does everybody else.   Hiring a MUA who specializes in tattoo coverups will cost extra and given the weather, makeup will melt.  And I'm not about to risk someone's health by making her wear a long-sleeved anything in triple degree desert heat.  \n\nKelly whined about being excluded to my dad about it and he and his new wife are at my throat about this.  His wife is pissed that I am treating her daughter this way and that I should be mindful now that we're all family now.  I've known this woman for maybe two years now.  Her daughter is a blip in the timeline that is my life.  Given my dad's track record with women, she'll be out of my life just as fast.  \n\nCorrin has been in my life longer than Kelly has been alive.

If Kelly is so averse to JK Rowling\u2019s politics that she can\u2019t be around someone with Harry Potter imagery on their body, she should just avoid Corrin at the wedding.\n\nI\u2019m not going to get into my feeling on either Kelly\u2019s or Corrin\u2019s views, except to say that this falls WELL within the category of \u201cthings you just need to deal with as an adult\u201d.  Kelly will struggle in life if she can\u2019t suppress her feelings on a topic like this for one afternoon.", "NTA. Harry Potter meant a lot to our generation (33F). While I hate JKR, she provided me an escape during a particularly rough childhood. If Kelly can\u2019t handle the tattoos, she needs to deal with it.

If there are things in this world you don't like, you can make the effort to stay away.  No one is going to safe-proof the world for you.

Kelly sounds desperate for attention and jealous that you as the bride were the centre of attention for the day so she\u2019s creating an issue.

They're about a wizard boy and what that meant to your friend.\n\nTell her to grow up, she's 17. There's going to be plenty in life she doesn't like, and she'll just have to suck it up buttercup.

I have seen multiple people get booted from my movie/book groups for mentioning HP/JKR and most of the communities have rules about that topic being banned. \n\nI read/consumed the material when I was younger and eventually found it problematic \u2026 and once JKR opened up about her crappiness that just sealed the deal for me. However, I know the series means a lot to a great deal of people and all I can really say is grow some thick skin because that generation is going to keep coming for your HP fandom. \n\nHarry Potter is treated like \u201chate speech\u201d in almost every Facebook group I\u2019m in and I don\u2019t see that negative association letting up anytime soon.", "What the f did I just read?

It\u2019s gotten to the point of \u201call trans women are men that rape women\u2019s spaces by entering them\u201d, which is probably why Kelly\u2019s drawing a hard line. I get that the series is meaningful for a lot of millennials, but if I see a shirt or scarf I\u2019m usually at least on edge as a trans person. A whole sleeve is a different story- it\u2019s just bad luck that it aged so poorly. I had a few friends that got the D&D logo tattooed and nearly wanted to get it removed after the new update about a year back \ud83d\ude05 So long as people at least have the right intention, even if they don\u2019t say the exact right thing, I\u2019m usually good.", "To be fair, Rowling still gets royalties from the games even though she didn't take part in its creation.

Sexism is reducing womanhood to the regressive, outdated, conservative stereotypes forced on us by elite white men. It\u2019s sexist to allow men to reduce womanhood to things that turn them on- dresses, heels, makeup, etc. I don\u2019t understand how so many young kids are spouting the same sexist nonsense republicans were spouting in the 90s. And y\u2019all think you\u2019re progressives? LOL.", "How would you rework a full sleeve tattoo?\n\nIt's one thing to do a limited tweak, which often means going bigger. That's not really viable with a sleeve.", "> yeah I think the fact that she's not trans makes a relevant difference\n\n...\n\nHow so? Like if Corrin had gotten these tattoos in the last 5 years, I could sort of see the argument. If Corrin got these 15 years ago before JKR's awful views on trans people came out, however, I'm not sure I follow.\n\nExpecting Corrin to cover up something that's been a part of her for over a decade simply because it makes another person uncomfortable should absolutely be something that resonates *badly* with a transperson.\n\nWe've all been where Corrin is standing in this hypothetical when it comes to \"I'm uncomfortable with the choices someone made around their body, you need to make them stop\" after all.", "I wonder whether the kid told the parents what was actually going on, or just that one of the bridesmaids has very offensive tattoos they refuse to cover (without mentioning what the tattoos are and that it\u2019s not a clear-cut case where everyone agrees it\u2019s offensive).", "Can attest to the bitterly disappointed and disgusted with JK. It\u2019s personably hard for me to separate the artist from the art, so I don\u2019t enjoy it as much anymore but I already have some stuff I can\u2019t get rid of because it\u2019s intertwined with my childhood. \n\nI would also add that a lot of us got tattoos and stuff before JK came out as a TERF so it\u2019s really dumb to think just cause someone has HP tattoos, that they endorse JK\u2019s nasty views. OPs stepsister needs to learn some critical thinking skills and to look at things with nuance.", "Exactly, and a lot of people with HP tattoos got them before JKR went down the terf rabbit hole. Including people in the LGBT+ community!! Hell, I was nearly one of those people, and I'm glad I held off now! It absolutely doesn't automatically equal an endorsement of views. \nAlso, small tattoos are easy to cover with something new, but a whole sleeve would be expensive, and at that point, the art is part of C's life/body. \n\nTo OP: Kelly has her heart in the right place-ish, but she needs to learn some grace and compassion. Black and white thinking is really counter productive, and she hopefully will learn that every situation is different; using broad strokes will never work when it comes to interpersonal issues. At the end of the day, she is 17 so it probably does seem like life or death to her. She's finding her voice and learning how to use it (she has a lot to learn, clearly). I'd advise to be firm but kind, but I also get that this girl is a relative stranger so the amount of energy you want to put into it is up to you.", "What did jk Rowling do?", "Thanks for this.  I was wondering, \"what could she possibly have against Harry Potter?\"  and then you reminded me that it's possibly not Harry at all.\n\nUnless it *is* Harry, and she just doesn't like witchcraft.  Tough.", "When it comes to separating the art from the artist, everyone should be allowed to make their own decisions. Asking people to boycott a newly released work by an awful person is reasonable because the bad person getting money from that. Asking people to stop loving something they fell in love with before they knew that the author (or director or star or other person involved in the creation) was terrible and never revisit the copies of the work they already own is too much. Demanding that they do so is really not okay. \n\nIf you don't want to read or watch Harry Potter material anymore due to Rowling's views, that makes perfect sense and I support the decision. But some people who care about trans people or are trans themselves are able to separate the work from the person and that's okay.", ">Rowling isn't getting royalties from random people's tattoos.\n\nAs someone who hasn't been able to afford their harry potter tattoo, I will absolutely be getting one.

It isn't like anybody gets to ignore that there are bigots in the world, so I would think the most widespread feeling would be a hope that Rowling gets a clue or keeps her views more to herself.", "Did she say the part about werewolves not controlling themselves and attacking children (which seems more like an individual bad character trait than a general one to all the werewolves)? Or did she just compare them, and it was possibly a reference to the fact that they're shunned and when parents found out one was a teacher he was forced to leave his job?\n\nNot excusing her other stuff, but if we're going to criticise a person, we should be doing it about things they actually said/did.", "In that context she was talking about werewolves being forced to live underground and not be themselves because of others bigotry surrounding something was wasn\u2019t a choice. Whether it\u2019s a good analogy or not, she wasn\u2019t comparing gay people to predators. \n\nAlso, I find the goblins-as-Jews thing a stretch. Though she does fail with stereotypes at times and having POC as background characters only, I think people are reverse engineering a lot of stuff in her books after finding out she\u2019s transphobic.", "She also said Dumbledore is gay.", "Can you post a link to where she says \u201dall trans women are men that rape women\u2019s spaces by entering them\u201d?", "Which is interesting to me, because d&d has had so many problematic racist and sexist themes previously that there was already similar reasons to despise it. \n\nI love the game.

I'd lose so much art in my life if I had to reject racist and sexist authors. \n\nBut also, thank you for explaining the discomfort you feel seeing people wear harry potter things. I can't assume people don't see harry potter as transphobic despite seeing jk as a terf, just because I don't see doctor Seuss or Roald Dahl  characters as racist.\n\nEdit to add: Rudyard Kipling is probably a better example than dr seuss, because he was pretty explicit in his racism.", "another, more accurate, name for them too is FARTs! feminism appropriating reactionary transphobes", "Op said 'themed' which made me think it was multiple integrated tattoos instead of just one. \n\nIt obviously depends on the tattoos, but most can be reworked by a good artist.", "Oh, definitely. I feel similarly about, say, Michael Jackson and Keven Spacey and so on. Like, damn if MJ isn't a bop, buuuut... ergh. Not like I didn't love House of Cards and couldn't enjoy listening to Spacey narrate a phone book, but... ergh. Ellen DeGeneres? VERY much a pioneer and huge for the visibility of queer folk but.... errrrgh. \n\nThis happens a lot, unfortunately. Idols fall from pedestals. \n\nI also think that Kelly doesn't have the full view, because, if she's 17, she likely grew up WELL aware of JK's views, but, like, those of us who are pushing 40? That didn't happen until well after our childhoods were dominated by HP, and many of us created very strong attachments and a love of reading/fantasy what-have-you because of it. And, yes, many got tattoos well-before all of the shit went down. \n\nBut, I mean, Kelly is operating out of her own worldview, where JK tainted HP far earlier in her life than for us. That's what needs to be explained to her. Her views make sense in her own timeframe to a certain extent, but it's not like Harry Potter dropped hot in 2020 alongside a stream of TERF nonsense. \n\nI started reading the series back in 1999.
