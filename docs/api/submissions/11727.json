I'm honestly not sure why it is that she's always disliked me and been cold to me, but after multiple attempts over the years to build some type of relationship with her (we've been together for 4 years) nothing has worked.\n\nShe couldn't give two shits about me up until the wedding planning started a few months ago... My fiance and I are paying for majority of the wedding ourselves, while my dad and stepmom are fiancially contributing as well. MIL and FIL have not contributed at all, but MIL is giving her opinion on thing's as if she's footing the bill.\n\n\"You should make the themes this color\", \"make sure you have this dish on the menu to be served\", \"don't do an open bar you don't want people being too rowdy\", \"make sure me, my sister and cousin are sitting front row at the wedding ceremony\" etc etc.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I are absolutely sick of this. Every time she tries to give an opinion we politely shut it down and tell her we have it under control, but she just never gets the hint!\n\nBefore she became such a nightmare I regretfully invited her to come dress shopping, because I didn't want her to feel left out.\n\nWhile a few weeks ago we went dress shopping (my mom and close friends came too) and I found my DREAM wedding dress. I have a curvy hourglass figure, and I found a dress that shows off my figure perfectly and makes me feel gorgeous. The dress is kind of revealing (low cut on the chest, and mermaid style) but it's nothing I'd be ashamed of my family and friends seeing me in.\n\nMy MIL on the other have HATED the dress I chose. She made sure to express that to me multiple times. She even went as far as to say \"this is a wedding, not a strip club I don't like it\". Well I bought the dress anyway since I'm the one paying for it after all.\n\nLast night my fianc\u00e9 and I are cleaning up after dinner and I received a call from the shop I ordered my dress from. They were calling me concerned because apparently a lady (my MIL) called then pretending to be me and wanted to switch the dress I chose to a more appropriate dress. The sales associate realized that It wasn't my phone number that called to make the change, and called me immediately to confirm before they changed the order. \n\nI was LIVID. My fianc\u00e9 heard the entire conversation and was LIVID as well. He called his mom to confront her and she fessed up, after denying it a few times. I told her if she's so bothered by my dress to consider herself uninvited from the wedding and hung up on her.\n\nSafe to say she is NOT happy. She's been calling both my husband and I non stop trying to defend herself but I've had enough. I feel bad for my fianc\u00e9 because he won't get to have his planned dance with her.

Keep an eye on how he acts and reacts as this continues.  While it would be AH to set up something like this to \"test\" him, it is a test of your relationship and interactions, and it is entirely appropriate to use it as a moment to get a glimpse of what your future together may be.", "If Fiance is on board, turf her out. \n\nNTA. \n\nSounds like MIL needs some SERIOUS info dieting as well. Sucks for your fiance that his mom is so selfish but its probably better this way.", "NTA. I am sorry that your MIL is such a piece of work, but I'm glad your fiance supports you and is on your side. You will have a much nicer wedding day without her there.", "NTA. You said she's defending her actions still? The fact that she's not bending over backwards to apologize says it all. She's a lost cause. You'll have a much happier wedding without her.", "NTA. \n\nSpeak to all vendors and have only you and your fianc\u00e9e have any level of authority to make decisions with a verified pin/password.", "NTA. If your wedding dress was reasonably priced, buy a second one. Not for the safety of the dress, to wear every time you see her for the rest of her life. \n\nAlso, call every single person you've hired for the wedding, explain all this, and put a password protect feature on your account for any changes or cancelations.

You\u2019ve tried to include her and make the relationship work, but if she\u2019s really going to be a monster-in-law like that, I\u2019d definitely reduce contact, especially if you plan to have kids. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this!", "NTA. She\u2019s shown she cannot be trusted. She will ruin whatever else she can if given an opportunity. Do not let her come but be prepared for her to show up regardless.", "NTA - You stood up for yourself, and I'm happy to hear that your fianc\u00e9 stood up for you as well. All too often in these, the SO is a lapdog that does nothing while their parents treat their soon to be spouse like trash.  Yours sounds like a keeper!", "NTA, and grey rock the crap out of her. Give her no more information on the wedding. Talk it out with your fiance. If you can both come to an appropriate agreement, perhaps she can attend the wedding. But I would have serious stipulations. EX: she is no longer to receive ANY information about the wedding that is not on the invitation. She will not be allowed a speech, and she needs a trusted escort. Basically a babysitter at the wedding so she can't run off and change things with the vendors. \n\nPerhaps check out the JustNoMIL subreddit. Lots of helpful info there.", "NTA - She absolutely would have caused a scene at your wedding. What she did was fecking awful and someone like that doesn't respect people or boundaries. Better to be rid of her now than find out at the wedding...", "NTA - Honestly if she is willing to do this, I'd be worried what sort of things she would get up to the day of your actual wedding. \n\nIt sounds like your fiance is on board and was also upset with her for her attempts to control your wedding/change your dress. It is likely good to make sure you both remain on the same page and check in about her being uninvited if feelings seem to change.", "NTA. She needed to be put in her place.  It would take her showing up hat in hand with an agreement to specific set boundaries for all things regarding the wedding going forward in order to be allowed to attend.", "NTA. She's shown she can't be trusted. You need to establish boundaries with her. \n\nI recommend that you reach out to your other vendors and set up a word or phrase to use in case she tries to mess with your other plans.  Don't let her ruin your wedding!", " It sounds to me like her son needs to step in and defend both of you.

But set up passwords with all your vendors and honestly consider getting security for the day off.

How can you be an ah for refusing to accept unacceptable behavior? This wasn't annoying, this was over-the-top, wish you'd made it up but it's currently your life, grade A bullshit.

You should do passwords with all vendors and don't let her near your dress at anytime before the wedding. If she has keys to your home, change the locks. Your dress might come up missing before the wedding. \n\nTo any future MIL's out there- just let it go when it comes to the wedding. It's for your child and their partner, not you. If you need the spotlight so bad, do a vow renewal ceremony or an awesome anniversary party. Let the kids have the wedding they want!", "NTA. Once a control freak, always a control freak. Block crazy MIL's phone & socials. Make sure that your venders have passwords so she can't change anything. Also, either hire security or ask a couple of burly friends to act as security. Because she sounds like the type that would crash your wedding/reception just so she can cause a scene. Good luck.", "NTA password protect all of your venues and orders. Makes sure they do not change anything unless the person has the password.", "NTA.\n\nAs others have stated. Call every single vendor, the venue, officiant EVERYONE and slap a air tight password onto it all.\n\nPick the most ridiculous asinine thing possible. Something absolutely NO ONE would think of and put it in another language at that! Because she WILL target everything else. If she can't change the dress she's gonna aim for everything she can.\n\nAlso. Hire security. If she's no longer invited y'all will need security. Like ask the police station if theirs any off duty cops that wouldn't mind moonlighting as security for y'all or hire a security team. Just ensure it's no one that would favor her or feel bad for her. Make sure they got her name and picture. Same for the vendors/everyone else. Ensure they got her name, number and photo hell even her email and make it KNOWN she's a security/risk issue and absolutely nothing is to be changed without y'all present or an ID shown.\n\nI say this and know this cause my family is fucking insane and belongs on trash TV and I will be doing the exact things I'm suggesting to you myself if I ever get married.\n\nAlso start recording phone calls with her (check your states recording laws first. Not every state is a one-party consent state)cause....crazy is just crazy so y'all need to be ready to have evidence that she's the one starting shit.", "NTA - Sounds like MIL dearest won\u2019t / can\u2019t let go of her son. It\u2019s eating her up inside that she\u2019s losing her child, the loss of comfort he gives by being hers, things are going to change. Her relationship is going to change forever with her son. You were not so much of a threat prior to marriage. Now it\u2019s approaching, this scares your future MIL terribly.\n\nInstead of being mature and seeking comfort, assurances from her son and both of you, she only sees the threat of you taking him away from her, and is acting in an irrational way. Anyone in their right mind would know changing the gown would be a step too far, but your MIL didn\u2019t see it that way. She only saw it as a way of keeping her son and couldn\u2019t think beyond this. \n\nIt boggles the mind what people will do for self preservation. If future MIL can\u2019t get the help she needs (unbiased help), then I see a wedding that you and future hubby will remember for the wrong reasons. \n\nIf you both understand her personal suffering (which is affecting everyone in the most vicious way), you can both maturely approach this with an equal understanding of your feelings, your fianc\u00e9\u2019s and future MIL - then take things from there. \n\nBest wishes to you in this situation and your upcoming wedding.\n\nEdit: added a dash (-).", "SOOOO NTA.

Passwords with all vendors, put your wedding parties on notice, have your dress held at the house of one of your relatives/bridesmaids whom MIL has no way of contacting, and security at the wedding itself.\n\nSo sorry that you have to go through all this drama and stress. Best of luck for your wedding day!", "NTA. That's a special level of nuts for any MIL. Be warned though, this won't stop here. Going low contact or possibly no contact may be in your future...and it sounds like it would be warranted at some point.", "NTA\n\nShe has routinely shown that she doesn't respect you *or your fiance*.   \nTell her that if she'd like to be re-invited to the wedding then she will have to pay you a retainer fee, as such, every time she offers her broke ass opinion then she will be charged X, any time she tries to sabotage she will have to pay X. In addition, any scenes caused at the wedding will be X and she will promptly be removed from the venue  \n\n\nOh, and if you do re-invite her, be sure to seat her at the very back with her sister and cousin. Cause you KNOW she'll start some ish", "NTA, and arrange for her to be removed if she arrives.", "That is some low down deception from MIL. In my opinion, you haven't taken it far enough - I'd tell her all the hundreds of ways she's hurt you over the years and not leave out a single detail at this stage. \n\nAnd then when she inevitably feels remorseful and finally relents -- tell her she's still not invited!\n\nNTA", "NTA  You didn't take it far enough.  Go no contact with her for good, not just the wedding.  Consider moving and not giving her your address", "NTA!  Trying to sabotage your wedding dress is indefensible. \n\nShe is also still defending her actions, so she thinks she did nothing wrong.

And as you've seen, give an inch and she'll take a mile.\n\nIt sounds like your fiance is doing ok.

Keep an eye on that and talk with your fiance about it if it looks like he's not doing enough.", "I had to stop reading at \"don't do an open bar you don't want people being too rowdy\" because anyone telling you to make your guests pay for their drinks is clearly TA and their advice can be dismissed.  NTA.  \n\n\nThen I got curious and read the rest and still NTA. But I would let your fiance decide whether or not his mother is invited. What she did was horrid, but let HIM be the one to say she can or cannot come. And if she comes, keep your distance and make sure all staff know NOT to take directions from her.", "No she took it to far. You did nothing wrong. But you\u2019re going to want her at the wedding\n If you don\u2019t have her there it will haunt you for years to come. Be amicable with her but that\u2019s it. If you have to ghost her until your wedding day, do it. No shame in keeping your sanity. Sometimes we have to bite our tongue and keep the peace. Our husbands love their mothers no matter what. It\u2019s more for the sake of your fianc\u00e9. He\u2019s gonna feel the wrath for years to come if his mother doesn\u2019t attend his wedding. She is a part of your life now.
