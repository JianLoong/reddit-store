I think that their bond is adorable and heartwarming. Yesterday, my husband shows me a video that his mother posted on her FB when my kid was over.  It\u2019s a video on my daughter playing in the backyard and MIL is asking her random questions, like what\u2019s your favourite color etc. She asked her , who do you love more mommy or daddy? Of course , my daughter yells daddy. Which made my heart hurt a bit but it\u2019s ok , she\u2019s still young. \n\nThe thing is that I realized that my MIL captioned the post: \"She only needs her dad\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude18 I raised a good man\u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\".

MIL shouldn't be asking a child/toddler to voice which parent she loves more. It's manipulative and teaches her that the most reactive relationships are the ones most with love and other relationships are less valuable. Husband and you need to have a hard talk. About your feelings and what you're teaching little one IMO.", "Husband is TA. His mother is being disrespectful, it's his job to fix it.", "NTA \n\nMIL is using passive aggressive behavior and your husband, unfortunately, is oblivious to it because it\u2019s not an indirect attack on his character but on yours. She can sugar coat it with emojis but it\u2019s exhibiting negative feelings against you. \n\nNot only that you have a MIL problem but a husband one too who should have directly spoken to his mom.", "NTA\n\nWhy would she ask that or use that caption if not to be mean??? There are other ways to praise your son.", "NTA, because it's a shitty comment to make, but not sure it's worth the fight.  Plus there are plenty of passive aggressive or straight out aggressive comments you could make on that video.  I mean, she wouldn't have posted that video if she didn't want comments, right?  \n\n\n\"Luckily she has us both!\"  \n\"Not sure why she needs to pick a favorite.\"  \n\"Yeah, she doesn't even need grandma.\"  \n\"A good man would defend his wife.\"", "Personally I would ignore MIL however ....

Tell your husband your going to post it with the caption ... \u201cDaddy is raising a smart little girl\u201d. \n\nNTA\n\neta \u2014- oh wait ... even better ... ask daughter who Daddy loves more MOMMY or Grandma ... with that caption. Daddy is raising a smart little girl!!! That\u2019s the way to do it! (Don\u2019t post this btw) it\u2019s just to make your point.", "I doubt it's a coincidence that she asked that while making a video, so you're totally NTA to be upset by it.", "NTA if she can't be respectful then shut her down. Who says that to a child who do love more mommy or daddy. Of course your husband saw nothing wrong with it he came out of it looking good.", "NTA. The question in the video is extremely dumb itself, the caption is really offensive - your relationship with MIL is evidently not as good as you thought it was. And there is no way your husband does not understand what your MIL did wrong, looks like he just enjoys being praised as #1 even when it's hurting your feelings.", "NTA. Your MiL is shady, that\u2019s not acceptable.", "NTA your mother sounds like a snarky justnoMIL. I don't like pics of myself and don't like when people post them, I don't think I'd appreciate someone posting things of my kid without me being ok with it even without TA comment she put.", "NTA for asking her to change the caption at all. Explain how you feel and ask how she would feel in your situation? I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to ask her to stop posting your daughter at all, but changing the caption reasonable. It\u2019s also reasonable for you to ask her to think before writing captions like that. \n\nOn a side note, I read somewhere that infants and toddlers show preference for their fathers because they see their mother as an extension of themselves. She doesn\u2019t realize you and her are two different people. I have NO idea if it is true, but it made my friends feel better when she read it.", "NTA I don't care what your mother in law posted or it's caption, she should not be posting pictures or videos of a minor child on the internet. Those posts include geo-markers making it easier for people to track the location of your child.", "NTA. No one should be posting videos or pictures of your kids online at all without your express permission before hand. They are YOUR kids. NOT HERS. You have no idea who\u2019s on her friends list. Is she the kind of person that adds anyone that tries to friend her? \n\nIt\u2019s not safe out there.\n\nEdit: don\u2019t get me started on her caption. BEYOND inappropriate for a public forum.", "YWNBTA. It would have been fine to say she raised a good man. Cool. But \"She only needs her dad\"?? Completely rude and unnecessary to say. Also, untrue.", "NTA. The video is one thing, asking some of those questions a little much (who do you love MORE), but that caption -- hell to the no. She could have said something how lovely it is how much your daughter loves her dad, how much she loves watching their bond, etc, and how she's proud of the man he's become / she raised, but to indicate that your daughter *only* needs him is not okay. She should at least change the caption, and you husband should back you up. If she won't change the caption and you suspect future content will be captioned similarly, absolutely request her to not post your daughter anymore.", "NTA\n\nI am failing to imagine a way in which that wasn't fully intentional. She asked the question, got the answer she apparently wanted, and then posted on social media. There was no need, and I'd be more than a little miffed if some relative tried to encourage my own 3yo to pick a \"favorite\" parent.", "NTA, you have both a husband and MIL issue.  Mostly husband.", "NTA. Honestly it sounds like MIL definitely knows what she's playing at.  Seems to me that MIL has a secret agenda that isn't so secret anymore...said the quiet part outloud or in print then posted for god and all the world to see.  This isn't JUST a MIL problem, the BIGGER issue is that this IS a **husband** problem.", "NTA, that woman is heartless is she thinks it\u2019s even ok to film her grandchild while asking who she loves more, then to post it\u2026I would go nuclear!  \nYour husband might be a good Dad but she is a terrible partner is he doesn\u2019t have your back on that", "NTA.  Honestly I\u2019d leave the caption up so other people can see what a creep she is.  If I read a comment like that, I\u2019d judge MIL, not you.", "You have a husband problem.  The fact he sees nothing wrong with 1 - her even asking the question of who she loves more.  2- the posting it, because she wouldn\u2019t know that would hurt or that it\u2019s actually just spiteful, and 3- the \u201cshe only needs her dad\n\nNope.  Not the AH if you tell her not to do that.. BUT she won\u2019t listen because your husband is on her side and she knows it otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have don\u2019t what she did.  \n\nIf this kind of stuff is a regular thing, with your husband siding with his mother.. I\u2019d seriously consider your future together.  At the very least you need coiples therapy", "NTA\n\nThis is so inappropriate. Frankly, posting ANY media of kids without parental permission is not OK. I would seriously consider her not leaving her alone at your MIL's. MIL is pitting you and your husband against each other and filming things your daughter will almost certainly feel guilty about saying when she is older.", "NTA. However, in your shoes I would speak to MIL directly. I would ask her why she thinks I am irrelevant in my daughter\u2019s life. I would ask her why she believes her granddaughter doesn\u2019t need her mother. I would do that all with an innocent face. I suspect MIL will squirm at those questions, unless she\u2019s either evil or hates you. Either way, you will know the answer.", "NTA, the caption was hurtful. You need to speak to your mother in law and explain that it upset you - there\u2019s a good chance that she didn\u2019t think it through from your point of view and didn\u2019t mean offence. I would probably draw a line under this incident but ask her to think how her comments look to other people before posting in future.", "NTA. Your MIL, however, is.\n\nVery disrespectful to not only you, but her son and granddaughter. She should be ashamed of herself for posting this type of thing on social media and captioning it what she did.", "NTA. It's strange to ask a child which parent they like. I can't think of a good reason to ever ask it. I don't think I'd ask her to not post.. just be more thoughtful.", "NTA. Your MIL is the stereotypical Boy Mom^TM who is bitter and angry that some harpy (you) stole her precious baby boy's attention from her. She set up that video, asked that question deliberately, and posted it on the internet to prove the entire world that her special boy is a wonderful father to her cute granddaughter and wouldn't it all be perfect if it wasn't for that horrible harridan (you) monopolizing their time and stealing them away from her.\n\nThis is gross and psuedo-incestual. Your husband sees nothing wrong with it because she's been this way his entire life. He doesn't understand that she spoiled him rotten with hidden strings attached. The hidden strings are that he puts *her* above all other women in his life, *including you*.\n\nYou need to set boundaries. No more family posting anything with your daughter in it without your permission. She's your child. I would also not let your grandmother spend time with her anymore unsupervised. Your husband needs a wake-up call. Her relationship with him and the expectations she has for him are super toxic. Both his wife and his daughter come first and it's time he stood up for you.\n\nThis is also a **husband** issue. Look, when my fiance's parents started giving her a lot of crap about how they didn't approve of me, she immediately went out and took all of her life insurance out of their name and gave me half of the title to the house she bought solely so they couldn't kick me out, then she told them she would not speak to them if they didn't stop talking crap about me. ***That's what spouses are supposed to do***. If your husband doesn't understand that, he needs a come-to-Jesus sit down talk in a big way.", "NTA\n\nFirst, sit down and take time to really think about what is bothering you about the post. What inside of you was hurt the most about the post. Do you feel like you don't get enough time with your daughter? Do you have a fear of being seen badly by others? (That was one my own mother had.) What is the core issue at heart.\n\nTake the time to explore what you are feeling and talk about it with your husband. Explain what was triggered and why.\n\nAnd talk about how you can work on fixing that. Do you need more time with your kid? Do you work so much you are missing out on fun times? Do you just feel like you are being overlooked or walked on by your MIL? \n\nThen talk to him about his dismissive attitude about your concerns. You came to him feeling vulnerable and he sided with his mother. He was not willing to come together as one to speak to her about changing a caption on a video... something that is not really important but would have made you feel seen. \n\nSecond, when you have calmed down enough that you can have a good conversation with your MIL... one that aims to keep a good relationship... You should speak to her about the way she talks to your child. \n\nI would do it in person. If it were me, I would say the following, \"I understand how proud you are of the son you are raising. You obviously love both Husband and GrandDaughter. However, recently the post you made hurt my feelings. It takes away my part as her mother and makes it sound like the only parent around is your son. It also makes me feel like you don't respect me, which I have never felt was an issue before. I need you to stop posting videos of my child where you ask her favourites, imply that your son is the only good parent. If this is not possible, then you should not be posting things.\"", "NTA, I can see why you are offended, but I don't think this is worth ruining a decent MIL relationship over.  Unless you and MIL are both influencers and you've lost millions of dollars in advertising campaigns over your husband being deemed the favorite parent, you shouldn't spend any energy worrying about MIL's FB audience or the second-long thought they gave to the caption as they scrolled on by.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who do I love more, her or my dad? I used to say her, because that's the answer I knew she wanted.
