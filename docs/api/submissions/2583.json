He then asked if he could go fishing in the evening. I know it's stressful with money, work family, ect. So i let him go. He was out all night. Then, went to work on Sunday and then took his daughter home which is another obviously 2 hours. She basically spend 4 hours with him traveling. That was her time with her dad.\n\nI'm a stay at home mum. I'm not getting any breaks from the kids. He doesn't help me. He says he can't change the baby because he's too wriggly. He tells me that he needs time to relax so can't bath the kids or put them to bed. He will purposesly sit in bath all night so he doesn't have to help me. My 7 yo will not sleep unless someone lies with him and will be up every hour so I get no sleep.\n\nI cook meals for him for when he gets home and he is still hungry so will then cook and use every single utensil and pot he can find and I have to clean that up because he won't.

Yes he works but surely he's taking the piss out of me a bit?\n\n-- Addition\n\nI've gone absolutely crazy on the husband, told him what he did with his daughter was pure neglect.
