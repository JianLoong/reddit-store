Boys are 7 and 1 and Step daughter is 9.\n\nMy husband has always been a working man. Have to work or you don't get. He grew up in poor europe on a farm and works hard.\n\nHe seems to think it's ok to collect his daughter who lives 2 hours away on a friday, and go to work on the Saturday. He then asked if he could go fishing in the evening. I know it's stressful with money, work family, ect. So i let him go. He was out all night. Then, went to work on Sunday and then took his daughter home which is another obviously 2 hours. She basically spend 4 hours with him traveling. That was her time with her dad.\n\nI'm a stay at home mum. I'm not getting any breaks from the kids. He doesn't help me. He says he can't change the baby because he's too wriggly. He tells me that he needs time to relax so can't bath the kids or put them to bed. He will purposesly sit in bath all night so he doesn't have to help me. My 7 yo will not sleep unless someone lies with him and will be up every hour so I get no sleep.\n\nI cook meals for him for when he gets home and he is still hungry so will then cook and use every single utensil and pot he can find and I have to clean that up because he won't. He will leave empty drink bottles on the floor, empty crisp packets, any rubbish he can take to the bin, he won't. \n\nAm I the asshole for being angry at him!? Yes he works but surely he's taking the piss out of me a bit?\n\n-- Addition\n\nI've gone absolutely crazy on the husband, told him what he did with his daughter was pure neglect. He tells me it's because it's coming up to Christmas and wants more money. I've already done the Christmas shopping. So that's not what it is for. I think he just doesn't want to be home with us.", "created_utc": 1668709437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxxgsk/aita_or_being_taken_advantage_of/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How is he driving and working if a baby is too wriggly for him?", "NTA\n\nYou're not a wife, you're a nanny/maid/sex avatar/house manager. There are some fundamentally wrong things going on in your marriage and \"grew up poor so I need to work hard\" ain't the excuse he's pretending it is.", "NTA\n\nYour husband has his priorities backwards. I think a frank discussion about expectations is needed here and some division of duties. \n\nAlso, I would see a sleep specialist about your 7 year old, that is not normal sleep behavior for a child his age.", "NTA - parenting should be a partnership. He seems to get lots of breaks to hang w/ friends, etc. You should get the same. And he absolutely should not dump an extra child on you over the weekend and expect you to just deal with it.", "Honestly, what you need is relationship advice and figure out if you want to stay in this relationship where your husband is neglecting all aspect of his life, including you and his kids.\n\nYou should seek real help, not asking if you are an asshole. You are clearly not. You just need help.", "NTA\nStop doing what you\u2019re doing. Do just enough to keep the kids alive and safe, then do nothing else. Don\u2019t cook or clean.

On nights she participated in a different sport he stays home with the little so I don\u2019t have to drag her out and handle her. He will cook meals. He will wash dishes. He\u2019s changed thousands of diapers. He will wash/dry laundry. He won\u2019t fold it though LOL. I don\u2019t know why but thts where he draws a line. Your husband provides and I\u2019m not suggesting he take on half the household chores...but he can help. They are his kids. That is his home. Your being taken advantage of.", "NTA. If all he's bringing home is money and excuses not to parent his kids, he can do both of those with alimony and child support.", "NTA.

From what I understand he is purposely avoiding the kids, leaving a mess after himself (how hard is it to throw away your own garbage?! I hate these kinds of people) and refuses to help you in any way. If he is so tired, then he should lay with your 7yo, at least then he will be somewhat helpful.", "INFO: did you know he was a shitty and neglectful father before you decided to produce more children with him?", "NTA! \n\nWhen 2 people have a baby together, BOTH people's lives should change! Not just the mother's. \n\nAs others have said, please have a serious talk with him about this. \n\nMy daughter is going through something similar and I've tried multiple times to give her all the advice including having a talk but she's not listening.  \n\nYes, he may work hard to provide for your family, but you work just as hard! \n\nThere should be a fair division of cleaning, chores, bathing kids, cooking, etc.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like there's a good reason he has one ex wife, and you're waking up to them.", "When you have a husband like this, the chores need to be divided in black and white. He provides for the family, so you can take care of a higher percentage of the chores. The rest get divided 50/50. If he doesn't do his bit, it doesn't get done. Also, if you did these chores for someone else, you'd get paid. The next time he holds the money thing over your head, literally or otherwise, remind him of what he owes you. Lastly, even if you end up in a situation where this man becomes unbearable, you're entitled to a portion of his assets. You won't be totally helpless. Stop being afraid/guilty.", "NTA. This is not a healthy or sustainable situation for you and you are not being treated like a partner by your husband at all. The fact that he is the one that brings in the income does not mean that you should be expected to be working 24/7. The fact that he provides the income for your family absolutely does not mean that he doesn't have responsibilities in the home. You both work, let's be clear about that. The fact that he works outside the home and brings home a paycheque doesn't negate the amount of work you do within the home. You are not a slave and you are not a single parent, he has a responsibility to be a partner to you and not just shove all of the responsibility other than paying the bills onto you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You'd probably be better off if you left him. There are usually places than can help and he would be paying child support most likely since you would get main custody, since he does nothing for the kids it sounds like.

Detailing and figuring out what each of you can do to balance things out will help you. However, I am not sure how staying in the bath all night and avoiding your family can be broached with him. The division of labour isn\u2019t fair at all as you have told us. \n\nDo you have extended family? Parent support group through community or churches? Friends and in-laws to help you or him with some work/childcare?
