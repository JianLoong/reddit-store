I (31f) have been married for 11 years to my husband (35m). My job is extremely flexible to work around my 2 kids school schedules and I make decent money. My husband had this idea though that if there are dishes in the sink, or the floors need to swept, laundry folded, etc then I shouldn't go to work that day. We made the\"deal\"that if I went back to work,  this is how it would go. I feel it's a pretty unfair deal though. I try to save call offs for when the kids are sick, but it turns into a big thing everytime so I usually end up staying home and doing the chores. Some days I'm just so tired I didn't get around to it,but I think it's really unfair that I have to do all the appointments, grocery shopping, and  most of all the house chores. He says if i can't handle it, I should just quit, but we could use the money since we bought our first house this year.
