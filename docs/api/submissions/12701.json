I (31f) have been married for 11 years to my husband (35m). My job is extremely flexible to work around my 2 kids school schedules and I make decent money. My husband had this idea though that if there are dishes in the sink, or the floors need to swept, laundry folded, etc then I shouldn't go to work that day. We made the\"deal\"that if I went back to work,  this is how it would go. I feel it's a pretty unfair deal though. I try to save call offs for when the kids are sick, but it turns into a big thing everytime so I usually end up staying home and doing the chores. Some days I'm just so tired I didn't get around to it,but I think it's really unfair that I have to do all the appointments, grocery shopping, and  most of all the house chores. He says if i can't handle it, I should just quit, but we could use the money since we bought our first house this year. I feel like I'm going crazy, but I usually always give in on everything, but I really like my job.

Wishing you the best!\n\nCan't stress enough NTA!!!!", "My workplace wouldn\u2019t accept a call in from a spouse or family member unless you\u2019ve been in an accident and physically can\u2019t make the call yourself. It\u2019s very unprofessional and he would be putting your job in jeopardy. NTA \u2026 sounds like he is emotionally abusive.\nProbably wouldn\u2019t hurt to tell your boss that you\u2019re in a dv situation, in case he tries to call in sick for you or send in a resignation letter to be spiteful. Take care mumma x", "NTA and rethink the relationship as both partners need to do 50/50 not only you. If he is unwilling find a partner who does. Him calling YOUR WORK is a HUGE RED FLAG.", "If it's not a medical emergency or she physically is unable to make the call herself, there is no reason he should be calling out for her.", "Or someone who is too sick to call in - \"hi, my wife has Norovirus so she won't be at work today\" is reasonable imo because you're either puking or sleeping, y'know?", "I'm sorry but my ex freaking out over my phone was bc HE had something to hide. He was deflecting and figured If he could get away with it then I must be doing something wrong too. And he acted alot like yours in some ways. One of our biggest issues was that he originally wanted me to be a stay at home mom so I did. But then he would go through periods where we needed money and he would say it was bc I was lazy and didn't contribute to the household (only financially mattered here. Cleaning and kids was just expected)  but when I started looking to go back to work he would make comments when I was going to interviews like \"who are you trying to impress?!\" Or something like that. Which made me feel guilty. Just alot of fights until eventually he would break down about how he was just scared that I would meet someone else and realize I could do better blah blah blah until I gave up and decided to not bother looking for a job. By this point he was back on the SAHM band wagon. But it was a cycle and repeated the same way every time. It was exhausting. I remained a SAHM though until we split up. Due to his serial cheating. \n\nBut 3 years later I'm doing so much better. We had been together since high school so leaving was scary. I didn't know anything else and we have 3 kids. But man just to be able to do things on my own time, and not fight or be made to feel guilty for being tired or doing something for myself... or hell made to feel guilty for something HE is the one doing... it's a huge weight off My shoulders. \n\nIt's tough. I won't lie. The guilt and manipulation is their tool and they can't stand to have a decision made for them like getting a divorce. And sometimes that means the guilt and manipulation gets worse after separating. Making you feel like you ruined the marriage and should have tried harder. How can you do that to the kids and make them go thru this etc. If you are ever in this situation Just have to remember YOU didn't do anything HE did and it's just a tactic to get his way. That kids deserve to see a HEALTHY relationship. That was one of my main motivations was making sure my kids didn't grow up thinking this was normal and thinking they should stay and be miserable for the kids. Bc if I'm being honest... I wasn't My best self. By a long shot. And my kids deserve a happy mom. Not a depressed exhausted one. \n\nGood luck. If you ever need to vent my inbox is open.", "oh man. op, please, if you can, and when you have the headspace, check out alice, darling. it\u2019s a movie which would probably be very triggering but unfortunately validating what a lot of other folks are saying here. abuse doesn\u2019t always just happen one day. sometimes you\u2019re negged until you\u2019re no longer able to recognize yourself. i wish you the best!", "Wtf? You call in sick to work to clean your house because your husband is a misogynist asshole who doesn\u2019t contribute to chores? Did I get that right?\n\nNTA and get a divorce.", "NTA. This sounds like quite a coercive relationship. \n\nYou both work and contribute to household finances, and therefore should both share in household chores and duties. \n\nYour husband appears to be trying to get you fired so that you are a stay at home parent", "NTA. Are you his maid or his wife? It looks like you are the one that takes care of your children and the house, what does he do for the family?", "Honestly I knew NTA just from the title. But I did read the post. Double NTA. Why can't he help around the house?", "NTA - this has massive red flags for abuse. Firstly, you both chose to have kids. Your husband doesn't get to decide whether you can go back to work or not and under which conditions you can. Why can't he do some chores? It's seriously sketchy that he's trying to edge you out of the workforce, where you would be completely dependent on him. Do not jeopardise your work - abusers deliberately try to get their partners fired.\n\nAlert your boss to the fact your partner should not be involved in your work life or calling you off, speak to family and friends about this and make a safety plan. Get all your key documents and be ready if you need to get out quickly.\n\nPlease read this *discreetly*: [https://archive.org/details/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/mode/2up)", "What does your husband do for work and how many days/hours does he do a week if he has a job?\n\nIf he\u2019s at home an equal amount or more, he should be pulling his weight much more. \n\nAlso how lazy can you be to not wash dishes or fold clothes? I\u2019m not a domestic god by any means but holy hell thats bare minimum. He needs a wake up call.\n\nBefore you you moved in together I\u2019m guessing he lived with his parents and they did everything for him?", "NTA for wanting to set boundaries that you are human with a functioning brain and goals to accomplish.\n\nBut I wonder at the true nature of your mental health when you have to go public to get support over dirty dishes or laundry. He has two hands and a job he can do them as well. You are his wife not the family maid.", "YTA.\n\n> this is how it would go. I feel it's a pretty unfair deal though\n\nWhy make it then?? Crazy deal. Crazy to agree.", "Ummm, what kind of arrangement is this? You work and do all the child care and chores?\n\nDid you guys talk about whether you'll be a stay at home spouse or not before? Does your husband want you to be a SAHM? Do you?\n\nI feel like he's manipulating the situation in such a way you'll be fired and stuck at home, forever, or until you realise that you've been trapped and a financially dependent only on him.\n\nNTA. But please re-evaluate your living situation..", "Take your kids and run he's not good\nNTA op", "NTA at all.  Find a husband who wants a partner. Your current one wants a maid.", "Ok so I saw a few comments about you talking to him, I just hope you are safe", "Your husband is controlling, narcissistic, and, likely, financially abusive.If it's so damned important to have all that done, let him call off, and do it. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nAnd, OP is NTA, here", "NTA and I strongly suggest you set your foot down on this.\n\nHousehold chores are for those who live there. \n\nWhat chores does he do? And you?\n\nMake a list. Approximate the time for everything. Then divide the chores EQUALLY.\n\nSet a good example for your children. \n\nAnd keep your job! This is so important. You need to be independent.", "OP, you are not that man's wife. Merely his slave and personal baby maker. NTA. Take the kids and run. It got this worse and will turn into Hell before you've got a chance to stop and think.", "OP, WFH is still working. It's not that you're laying around only having to do housework. \n\nIf he is so insistent on having the house clean, he can take a day off from his work. His views of you having to stay home just come off as sexist.", "Talk to your boss about not accepting your husbands call outs. He is controlling and you are not the only person capable of doing chores. NTA.", ">but I figured since I agreed, I was kind of stuck.\n\nOkay... first thing: you can *always* revisit agreements in a relationship if you feel things have changed, or they're unfair or unreasonable for any other reason. You're never stuck forever in a marriage if you don't want to, so why would you be in any agreement *within* the marriage?\n\nSecond thing: why would you ever agree that taking on chores at the expense of your job is a reasonable thing to do? Why is it not both your jobs to take care of chores in the house?", "I\u2019m sorry but your husband seems very controlling and is pretty much setting up things so it\u2019s always a lose lose for you.  He is doing things that give him more control over you and isolate you from others.  He is not taking you or your feelings, wellbeing or mental health into count.   It\u2019s what he wants and needs.  If he needs the house so clean he should be helping.  Yes you could be a stay at home mom, but would that be good for you mentally? I don\u2019t think so since you enjoy your job and the money.  \n\nIf he won\u2019t go to therapy with you go by yourself.", "This is super controlling on your husband's part, and quite misogynistic. You need to look at the big picture and see how he treats you.\n\nOP is NTA.", "OP, do not miss work for housework. You are endangering your employability. You will need this if you ever find yourself single. \n\nDo NOT call in. Housework is not \"earning money\", your job is. You have a new house and that should be BOTH you and your husbands priority.\n\nGet couples counseling ASAP! You are not the hired help and he is not your supervisor who decides your schedule. This is serious. Get help.", "How much does your husband work at the steel factory? Hours wise?", "You say that like it's guaranteed...", "I would not have embarrassed my elementary school child over home issues", "I think it would be really good, if you feel comfortable, to let someone at your work know the high level situation. God forbid, if anything happens to you, or your husband calls in sick for you again, they can have a plan in place to ensure you are ok.", "No sane person would. But it is still treating her like a child. \"can't leave until your chores are done\"", "absolutely, and a very dangerous future if she stays not just for her but for her children.", "OP be careful. Abusers are manipulative and can be dangerous. Have a safety plan before confronting him.", "The enthusiasm is awesome! I also want to tell you not to be too hard yourself if you run into challenges with said new backbone. The \u201cmuscles\u201d meant to support it have likely atrophied from years of disuse. It may not work out that you find your strength all in one go. What matters is keeping the flame alive from the spark of insight you\u2019ve just had.\n\nActually what matters *most* right now is your and your kids\u2019 safety,", "I have to agree. When you see the discussion is going nowhere, in this case I'd rather seemingly concede quietly and draw the consequences silently - packing up making an escape, without announcing it. You can talk with rational people, but when it's about abuse, you need to at least be able to judge that persons response very well."]}
