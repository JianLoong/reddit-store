A good friend of mine from high school is a lawyer and he advised me to prepare a cease and desist letter(my main language is not English but this is the closest thing that google translate said it in the legal terms)  and he did it for me without any charges because he said \"that's what good friends do.\" My brother is sad that I am not even entertaining the idea of a relationship but he says it is OK and he understands it. He just sees them from a different perspective,the same perspective that he sees the patients he is taking care of.\n\nMy mother and father weren't happy about the restraining order and accused me of being cruel and heartless.They said I am being the embodiment of a demon and they said they will cut contact with me if I ever put this plan into action. I said \"well,consider this as our last talk then.\" and left their house (I am residing at my own apartment that my grandparents gave me as a birthday present on my 18th birthday so no worries,it is in my name and no one can touch it.). We haven't spoken a word since and I doubt this will change in the foreseeable future. My parents are too forgiving and since childhood,I was told I am being too vindictive,this still continues from their side. My parents say I remind them of my great grandfather who ruined peoples lives just because they did small things wrong to him. I am not gonna try to argue with that.\n\nMy grandparents though ,they have understood my perspective and they said they will respect my boundary but they also asked me to respect their boundary to have a relationship,I said of course and we had an agreement. I still love them so much and I am lucky enough to have the compassionate parental figures that can understand where I am coming from.\n\nOther extended family members have divided into two,most of them think I am cruel and they don't want to have a relationship with me anymore other than being civil around each other and some of them still want to protect the relationship we have. I can live with this.\n\nI am also back in therapy. Thanks to my brother,he arranged a session with the therapist and also an appointment with a psychiatrist in his hospital so I am currently back in therapy and started to use antidepressants. It doesn't solve all the problems but it helps. \n\nAs it for me,my life continues as my birth parents never showed up. I go to work and have some me time on the weekends and spend some time with my friends whenever I can find the time and I go visit my grandparents once in every 2 weeks. They live next door to each other. My brother is my next door neighbor so we eat most of the dinners together when he is not on the night shifts. That nights,I mostly find a guy to spend some time with.", "created_utc": 1698069482, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17el1d3/updateaita_for_laughing_at_my_biological_parents/", "score": 819, "replies": ["Your NTA.  Look, your parents were a train wreck and the best thing they did for you and your brother was to leave you at the hospital.  They fixed their lives and that is commendable.  That said, you are under no obligation to forgive them.  They left you.  Some people can recover from that, some can\u2019t.  That doesn\u2019t make you awful, it just makes you human.", "So, missing info, what happened that cause a cease and desist/ restraining order to be issued?", "NTA. The majority of your family sounds toxic. I'm glad you're in therapy and getting the help you need. And I'm glad you have gone NC with everyone harassing you and calling you names. You are not a demon by any stretch of the imagination. You are not to blame for other people's bad behavior and when you react to protect yourself from that behavior, you are not wrong. I'm sorry your parents and bio-parents are both ignorant and hateful.", "I went NC with my dad at age 16 and I'm extremely LC with my mom as an adult.  She's an alcoholic with no sense of boundaries and feels she has free rein to say and do whatever she wants to with my young daughters.  My wife and I actually had to put a gate at the end of our lane to keep her from coming to the house unannounced.  Sometimes blood relations aren't really family.  Good for you for standing up for yourself and your grandparents for supporting you.", "Good update!!  Best wishes OP.  As always NTA.", "There\u2019s a thread that asks what\u2019s the longest time you hold your grudge and some answers cracked me up hard. Good for you OP, Dont feel bad about not forgiving them! Best wishes to you and I hope you don\u2019t have to deal with them again. Keep in mind that they might still bother you when they are older and sick etc., but it\u2019s not your problem!", "Absolutely insane that the majority of OPs family is more ok with abandoning newborns at a hospital in another country than they are with OP being upset about being abandoned as an infant.", "NTA. You are allowed to live your life as you please and no one should tell you what to do, you have no obligation to accept your bio parents back. I consider myself a forgiving person, a good christian, ut what your bio parents did is was beyond forgiveness.", "NTA! Wow. Your adopted parents cut you off because you were too \"vindictive\" cutting contact with your bio parents who abandoned you?  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.  While I think it is totally reasonable for them and for your brother to accept your bio parents back into to your lives it is equally as reasonable for you to want nothing to do with people who abandoned you at birth in a third world country.  Stick to your guns and enjoy your life without them!", "Are they harassing you or threatening you?  I guess I don't completely understand the restraining order or whatever version you're using.  Did they insist on contacting you?   It kind of sounds like you had a bad conversation and then you decided to dial it up to 11.  Glad you're in therapy.", "So your family is angry at you because you don't want a relationship with the ppl that threw you away?  Doesn't make sense..  \n\nYou were a child, a small child that was thrown away because they couldn't get their crap together..  Just because they have now, doesn't mean you have to forgive them.  They got their shit together YEARS ago..  why now?\n\nI will say this, anger is a hard stone to carry..  If they need to hear that you forgive them, then say it, with the understanding that because of THEIR actions- you want nothing to do with them.  It's a lot easier to light the match and blow up that bridge, then have to deal with their crap", "Honestly, I'm a little shocked that you jumped to legal action toward your bioparents and cut off so much of your existing family, including those who raised you. \n\nBUT, I am floored that your parents were so cruel to you about your decision. It sounds like they want to blame/punish you for your reaction to your bioparents showing up and were not willing to understand your perspective. It's possible that they are transferring their guilt/anger from themselves/bioparents onto you, which is obviously unjust. \n\nAnd it sounds like they were the ones who initially threatened NC, as a way to force you to stop \"punishing\" your bioparents and forgive and forget. I wonder if this is their way of \"protecting\" their siblings, now, since they failed to protect them, when they were younger. It seems far too severe of a reaction to come solely from bioparents suddenly popping up with their lives together. \n\nObviously, I do think the cease and desist is vindictive and possibly, partially aimed at your parents, as well, for welcoming your bioparents back into the family so easily. I can definitely see how that would feel like a betrayal to you, after what bioparents did to you and your brother, as well as the rest of the family. And, even if it is vindictive, you deserve the right and support to decide how you want to react to the situation. \n\nSo, still NTA. But, I will recommend to try your best not to be an AH to yourself, also. Holding on to resentment and using revenge as a way to deal with tragedy can have some awful effects on a person, esp long term. So, make sure that any choices you make prioritize your health, happiness, and safety. You are the priority!\n\nAs evidenced by you, your brother, and your grandparents, everyone reacts differently to these things. There is nothing wrong with feeling hurt, upset, or wanting NC. There is also nothing wrong with wanting to get to know them or forgiveness, bc those things are also solely for you to gain something. You also don't have to only pick one reaction. You can also change your mind as often as needed, if what you want changes. \n\nNeither resentment, nor forgiveness can change the past and they certainly do not excuse it. Your bioparents were not parents to you. That's simply the reality of it and nothing can change that. Getting to know them now can't undo what has happened. So, if you feel like it would be too painful to know them, now, that's understandable. But, if you ever feel curious about them or want to try knowing them as acquaintances (or friends or family), there is also nothing wrong with that either.", "They did not do \"small things wrong\" to you. They completely and utterly failed you for 25 years. You are not being vindictive. You are responding entirely reasonably. They CAN chose to leave your life literally as soon as was humanly possible. That's their choice, and no one can really do anything about that.  But they can't decide how you should feel or react to them afterwards. They can't chose when you do or don't have parents as they please. When they abandoned you, they abandoned the right/ability to decide their place in your life. You don't owe them forgiveness or love or even respect. You are not bad, angry, violent, or mean for how you react to this, no matter what. If they don't like it, tell them they should've raised you better.", "How is them cutting you off different from them abandoning you for 20 years", "Due to the nature of the previous case,by our countries law I can ask for a cease and desist letter but that is not a restraining order. It is just a warning letter against them saying if you ever come close to me I will accept that as an assault  and I will act according to that.", "OP seems to be of the very strong opinion that the bio parents are not worth even trying to maintain a relationship.  Putting a hard legal boundary is their way of ensuring this does not escalate.", "Is the cease and desist order absolutely necessary? Perhaps not. BUT these are people who abandoned her at birth in a hospital in a foreign country where she had on family. And they came back years latter wanting to play family. I think the order is a totally appropriate act of symbolic rejection directed towards those who walked away from her at her most vulnerable.", "So what happened that lead to that?", "You need to read the previous post. They abandoned her and her twin brother at a hospital in Sri Lanka just after they were born. The people at the hospital worked to find the family to care for the babies.\n\nThe parents basically disappeared for more than 20 years and now want to be forgiven.", "OP is male, not female.", "I've read it.  They seemed quite cordial after the bio parents returned. \n\nSo again, what changed to cause OP to want a restraining order?", "The probably weren't leaving OP alone, after being told to do so.\n\nPaperwork like this is the next step in those cases.", "It was a preventative thing. My lawyer friend said they would continue to pester me or even ambush me at my house so I took this initiative as a primary prevention", "I would hope that's all it was, and not something even more fucked up.", "Your intuition was right", "Oh man, this feels quite a bit like my situation with my birth mother.\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer here. You get to feel how you feel and it's not wrong. I don't think you're being cruel. For whatever that's worth. \n\nYou're old enough now to not really need anything from them. You experienced them - which is more that I've gotten tbh - and found that you and them didn't mesh. That's not a bad thing. You shouldn't force a relationship just because of biological bonds. No one *should* be guilt tripping you over this. You're 25, I think you're good.\n\nRemember, this is not a \"little thing\". They literally gave up their children and abandoned you in another country with no care as to what would physically happen. There is no amount of forgiveness seeking they can do to really right that wrong.", "When someone abandones you , you are never in the wrong. On the contrary you took measurements really important to protect yourself. You did well . NO YOU ARE NOT THE AITA. You did well to go to therapy i suggest you start a more crative hobby bc from that post's last paragraph i  am under the impression that your life is a little dull. Do something that makes you feel good", "Why doesn't this post have the yellow Update color?", "NTA Your family has NO right to try and minimize or manipulate your reaction to your life experiences. This did not happen directly to them. You lived it. The fact that your parents cleaned up their act is commendable but then to turn around and get mad at you for still having feelings about it? Nope. Do whatever you have to go feel safe and okay. And kudos to the people in your family that get it and support you.", "> My mother and father weren't happy about the restraining order and accused me of being cruel and heartless.They said I am being the embodiment of a demon and they said they will cut contact with me if I ever put this plan into action. \n\nthat's a threat?  If you get a restraining order, they'll cut contact with you...basically, they'll obey the restraining order?\n\nIt doesn't sound like they understand how these things work.", "I suspect that the people in your family saying that you are being cruel or whatever are thinking of this from the point of view that \"you got a lovely family and a good life out of them abandoning you\" and aren't focusing on the \"abandoning you\" part and how that could / would / and did make you feel. \n\nThe fact that something good came out of something bad does not erase the something bad. You can love your family and still wish you had not had feckless bio-parents. You can love your current life and still feel that you are missing something. \n\nHere is a thought experiment for those family members who may feel like \"you could make up with them\" but are open to talking to you. Ask them this: \"If you were in a car accident tomorrow with a drunk driver, and you lost both your legs in the accident and had to go through years of physical and mental therapy to get better. And during that time, at therapy, you met the love of your life and got married and had kids. How would you feel if the drunk driver showed up 20 years later and said \"hey, sorry about that. Can I hang out with you now?\" Would you really be cool with that? Sure, you have a lovely life now, but you had to go through hell and that person put you through hell. Okay, maybe you can forgive them. But do you need to have them become part of your life now? Can you see how I can be so happy to be part of this family and yet still feel the trauma from their actions. And their need/desire to have me PLAY AT being a family with them... that's disgusting to me. It's not the showing up and saying sorry - it's the \"can I be part of your life now and call me mom!\"", "It sounds like you have issues you need help with so I'm glad you're in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. I hope you find the peace you need. As for having strict boundaries, that's OK. It doesn't make you an AH. What you're bio parents did is no small thing. It's possible involving them in your life would help your healing process, it's also possible it could be a catalyst to more issues. I'll leave it to your therapist to offer advice on what you should do. I'll just say that regardless of what you choose, your NTA.", "Reading the first post I wondered what the family was like if the bio mom got into drugs at 14 and the bio dad had problems as a teenager too. Figured there was probably some toxicity in the first place, and after reading the rest of the family's reaction to OP not wanting anything to do with the adults who literally abandoned them in another country without even trying to contact back home, I feel firm in my stance that OP's family sucks.", "Nah. If she doesn\u2019t feel it she doesn\u2019t need to say it. She\u2019s still young, down the road she can change her mind if she feels differently.", "They abandoned their newborns in a foreign country and fled for 25 years. If authorities hadn\u2019t been able to track down OPs family, who knows what would have happened to them? \n\nBut sure, that\u2019s the same thing as cutting them off and hurting their feelings by calling them out for what they\u2019ve done.", "Yeah, I get it, and it's NTA.  He obviously thinks it's necessary.  But he hasn't indicated in any way that anyone was trying to escalate at all, just that they were sad and upset.  The legal thing isn't necessarily because there's any chance of that - it's because he wants to send a message.  You can have a boundary that doesn't involve lawyers, we all do it all the time.  If this is necessary, fine, but when you take things to possibly unwarranted extremes you may (as in this case) end up harming other relationships, which he has deemed an acceptable result.\n\nAgain, we may be missing information here - OP may have been harassed by these birth parents, in which case I'm 100% in favor of a legal approach.  I'm just working off of what he has shared.", "My read is that the \"cordiality\" that OP was showing was out of a desire not to make waves with the people they called mom and dad.  There was no reconciliation on their side...but everyone thought they was on the table.  And then their bio parents said the precise wrong thing.  And found out that OP had been hiding a metaphorical Mossberg behind them, and decided to rack the slide as their first and only warning.\n\nRuthless, yes.  Over the top, maybe.  But that does not give the adoptive parents the right to make disownment threats.", ">when you take things to possibly unwarranted extremes\n\nI dunno, turnabout is fair play. The parents abandoned their babies, using the hospital system to handle the situation using the info on record. OP turned away from them, using the legal system to provide a record of the state of play. \n\nOP didn't use the legal system in any way other than to create a record. That's not unwarranted.", "OP is doing what SHE needs to to feel safe and okay. Doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else thinks.", "Well, they're assholes for making disownment threats, but they have the right to do whatever they want, as does OP, who has thought about his decision and is willing to take the heat.  At the end of the day it's his decision to take this approach.", "Of course, but this is indeed a subreddit in which posters put their situation out there in order to invite comments and feedback from other perspectives.  She can do whatever she wants, but hey, she asked, so I commented.", "It isn't a restraining order. She asked to be left alone and that's her right. She's an adult and owes them absolutely nothing.", "I think OP might mean a no contact order rather than restraining order, which is generally more benign (i.e. not really of violent incident necessarily) but enforceable if needed.", "Hey, you want to drive away your adoptive son because you're threatening him with ostracization because he rejected the child-endangering criminals who crawled back when the statute of limitations ran out?  I'm personally thinking that's what we call a low-percentage move right there.", "OP is a guy.", "Strangely that's what I thought at the beginning, and at some point I thought I was corrected!", "Eta I\u2019ll admit I skimmed the original post because I remembered the jist of it. I forgot at the 50k and the abandonment charges. My bad. His parents were shitty people and they might very well still be.   Do people want justice. Yes. Should they be totally forgiven? No.  Proceed with caution. Most definitely. But to preventatively cut them off\u2026 I guess I try to see the good in people. But everyone else just wants to tie them to a stake and burn them.   \n\n\nPreventative\u2026\u2026 I get your hurt.  Your bio parents screwed up big time 20 years ago. But if you think of how screwed up they were, could you imagine being raised by them?  They left you at the hospital where there was enough information and resources to make sure you could be taken care of and your family found. \n \nThey straighten their lives out and came back (took them a while, but they did). Had honest conversations, don\u2019t seem to be pushing or anything. Then you laugh at them for expressing how they felt and basically make it so they can never talk to you again. \n\nWhile it\u2019s up to you if you want them in your life or not, you took a drastic step to something that MIGHT happen.   If they were pestering you, then definitely give them the letter. But if they were just seeing if it was possible to get to know you, to find out what kind of relationship they can form with you and what they can do to support you.   \n\nSo I\u2019m going to say you\u2019re jumping the gun with the letter. It\u2019s your choice but you hardly gave them a chance. Hopefully you never screw up and have to rebuild bridges.", "> Hopefully you never screw up and have to rebuild bridges\n\n**Re**build?  What bridges did bio-parents ever build in the first place?", "???\n\nThe bio-mom said it was 'the hardest decision they ever made' but their bio-parents literally just saw them as an issue and abandoned them in another country in a hospital that was lucky to have their passport information available to find family.\n\nThe bio-parents probably didn't think that the twins would be put with their actual family, and just dumped into an orphanage or something.\n\nTheir bio-parents weren't looking out for them, and weren't willing to get clean and put themselves together to take care of their babies...so they just dumped them and ran. Not only that, but they stole thousands of dollars from their family to run away together.\n\nOP has every right to not want to see or speak to them ever again. It wasn't as if the bio-parents put them up for adoption because they knew they'd be bad parents. They literally didn't want the twins.\n\nIt's pretty crappy to try to tell OP that they were somehow looking out for them and their twin by abandoning them and disappearing for 20 years...they may have shaped themselves up, but they still abandoned their babies and are now popping in, with no current responsibility or effort to make up for anything--and just expect to be forgiven? And then bio-mom lies to try to be the victim here, saying it was 'soooo difficult' to abandon their child?\n\nAbsolutely not. OP is doing what's best for themselves. They don't want to give them a chance, and they don't want the bio-parents to harass them.", "well if OP were to leave children in foreign hospitals and don't contact or try to see if the children are healthy for Years then we see if he screws up or not. otherwise the parents can cry about this and realize that they were even lucky to have gotten to the cordial phase before they fucked it up.", "People like you shouldn\u2019t comment at all. They\u2019re awful people who deserve everything they get. They consciously made decisions like that for years even after being adults. Grow up.", "Im not saying the parents need to rebuild. They are trying to build. \n\nIm saying if he screws something, anything up in the future he will have to rebuild or mend that bridge. \n\nRight now he is shutting down any attempt his bio parents could have done to provide support or improve his life.", "Who told the kids the parents saw them as an issue?  We have 1 side of a huge story. And it\u2019s from someone that was rightfully very hurt by the situation. We aren\u2019t going to hear the whole story. We are hearing the story from a major player that has been hurt and thinks their actions as justified. We aren\u2019t going to hear anything but I\u2019m the victim and they are the villains. \n\nCan you imagine being in a foreign country. Screwed up and now you have twins?  A single baby is hard enough when you and your partner are stable and have a support system.  Throw them into a different country, twins, no support and not ready to settle down and be parent.   What those kids lives would have looked like if the parents had kept them???  They handled it poorly. There is no question about that. But they could have done worse. \n\nI hope none of you are ever put in the position to make the hard decisions where there really is no right answers.  Adoption could have been a good choice. But governments usually try their best to make sure children can go to families first.  \n\nCan you imagine screwing everything up, having a kid then calling your parents to tell them to come get you baby.  How hard and shameful that would have been.  Probably about as hard as it would have been to walk out of that hospital.  \n\nAdmitting you have failed sucks.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying op shouldn\u2019t cut off contact if proved to be needed. Im saying OP didn\u2019t like one comment that bio parents said and cut contact. To me that\u2019s a hurt kid lashing out.", "Who knows if they tried to contact? If they contacted the hospital they could have been told that the family picked them up. Maybe. Who knows. Things are different there than here and privacy has changed in 20 years.  And would the grandparents or other family members have told these kids \u201cyou parents called, they are still too screwed up to take care of you\u201d. And would the family have even given them a chance?"]}
