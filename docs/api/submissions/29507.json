{"id": 29507, "submission_id": "17el1d3", "title": "UPDATE:AITA for laughing at my biological parents face when they told me leaving us was the hardest decision they have made?", "selftext": "\nSo,I made a post here like a month ago about my birth parents and here is the original link to that post.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/upVjAOYAAz\nI would like to thank each and everyone of you who gave thought and time to comment on this post.\n\nSome stuff happened since that post\nFirst,my bio-mom and bio-dad are not allowed to contact with me unless they want to go in the jail. A good friend of mine from high school is a lawyer and he advised me to prepare a cease and desist letter(my main language is not English but this is the closest thing that google translate said it in the legal terms)  and he did it for me without any charges because he said \"that's what good friends do.\" My brother is sad that I am not even entertaining the idea of a relationship but he says it is OK and he understands it. He just sees them from a different perspective,the same perspective that he sees the patients he is taking care of.\n\nMy mother and father weren't happy about the restraining order and accused me of being cruel and heartless.They said I am being the embodiment of a demon and they said they will cut contact with me if I ever put this plan into action. I said \"well,consider this as our last talk then.\" and left their house (I am residing at my own apartment that my grandparents gave me as a birthday present on my 18th birthday so no worries,it is in my name and no one can touch it.). We haven't spoken a word since and I doubt this will change in the foreseeable future. My parents are too forgiving and since childhood,I was told I am being too vindictive,this still continues from their side. My parents say I remind them of my great grandfather who ruined peoples lives just because they did small things wrong to him. I am not gonna try to argue with that.\n\nMy grandparents though ,they have understood my perspective and they said they will respect my boundary but they also asked me to respect their boundary to have a relationship,I said of course and we had an agreement. I still love them so much and I am lucky enough to have the compassionate parental figures that can understand where I am coming from.\n\nOther extended family members have divided into two,most of them think I am cruel and they don't want to have a relationship with me anymore other than being civil around each other and some of them still want to protect the relationship we have. I can live with this.\n\nI am also back in therapy. Thanks to my brother,he arranged a session with the therapist and also an appointment with a psychiatrist in his hospital so I am currently back in therapy and started to use antidepressants. It doesn't solve all the problems but it helps. \n\nAs it for me,my life continues as my birth parents never showed up. I go to work and have some me time on the weekends and spend some time with my friends whenever I can find the time and I go visit my grandparents once in every 2 weeks. They live next door to each other. My brother is my next door neighbor so we eat most of the dinners together when he is not on the night shifts. That nights,I mostly find a guy to spend some time with.", "created_utc": 1698069482, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17el1d3/updateaita_for_laughing_at_my_biological_parents/", "score": 296, "replies": ["Your NTA.  Look, your parents were a train wreck and the best thing they did for you and your brother was to leave you at the hospital.  They fixed their lives and that is commendable.  That said, you are under no obligation to forgive them.  They left you.  Some people can recover from that, some can\u2019t.  That doesn\u2019t make you awful, it just makes you human.", "So, missing info, what happened that cause a cease and desist/ restraining order to be issued?", "NTA. The majority of your family sounds toxic. I'm glad you're in therapy and getting the help you need. And I'm glad you have gone NC with everyone harassing you and calling you names. You are not a demon by any stretch of the imagination. You are not to blame for other people's bad behavior and when you react to protect yourself from that behavior, you are not wrong. I'm sorry your parents and bio-parents are both ignorant and hateful.", "I went NC with my dad at age 16 and I'm extremely LC with my mom as an adult.  She's an alcoholic with no sense of boundaries and feels she has free rein to say and do whatever she wants to with my young daughters.  My wife and I actually had to put a gate at the end of our lane to keep her from coming to the house unannounced.  Sometimes blood relations aren't really family.  Good for you for standing up for yourself and your grandparents for supporting you.", "Good update!!  Best wishes OP.  As always NTA.", "There\u2019s a thread that asks what\u2019s the longest time you hold your grudge and some answers cracked me up hard. Good for you OP, Dont feel bad about not forgiving them! Best wishes to you and I hope you don\u2019t have to deal with them again. Keep in mind that they might still bother you when they are older and sick etc., but it\u2019s not your problem!", "Absolutely insane that the majority of OPs family is more ok with abandoning newborns at a hospital in another country than they are with OP being upset about being abandoned as an infant.", "NTA. You are allowed to live your life as you please and no one should tell you what to do, you have no obligation to accept your bio parents back. I consider myself a forgiving person, a good christian, ut what your bio parents did is was beyond forgiveness.", "NTA! Wow. Your adopted parents cut you off because you were too \"vindictive\" cutting contact with your bio parents who abandoned you?  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.  While I think it is totally reasonable for them and for your brother to accept your bio parents back into to your lives it is equally as reasonable for you to want nothing to do with people who abandoned you at birth in a third world country.  Stick to your guns and enjoy your life without them!", "Are they harassing you or threatening you?  I guess I don't completely understand the restraining order or whatever version you're using.  Did they insist on contacting you?   It kind of sounds like you had a bad conversation and then you decided to dial it up to 11.  Glad you're in therapy.", "So your family is angry at you because you don't want a relationship with the ppl that threw you away?  Doesn't make sense..  \n\nYou were a child, a small child that was thrown away because they couldn't get their crap together..  Just because they have now, doesn't mean you have to forgive them.  They got their shit together YEARS ago..  why now?\n\nI will say this, anger is a hard stone to carry..  If they need to hear that you forgive them, then say it, with the understanding that because of THEIR actions- you want nothing to do with them.  It's a lot easier to light the match and blow up that bridge, then have to deal with their crap", "Honestly, I'm a little shocked that you jumped to legal action toward your bioparents and cut off so much of your existing family, including those who raised you. \n\nBUT, I am floored that your parents were so cruel to you about your decision. It sounds like they want to blame/punish you for your reaction to your bioparents showing up and were not willing to understand your perspective. It's possible that they are transferring their guilt/anger from themselves/bioparents onto you, which is obviously unjust. \n\nAnd it sounds like they were the ones who initially threatened NC, as a way to force you to stop \"punishing\" your bioparents and forgive and forget. I wonder if this is their way of \"protecting\" their siblings, now, since they failed to protect them, when they were younger. It seems far too severe of a reaction to come solely from bioparents suddenly popping up with their lives together. \n\nObviously, I do think the cease and desist is vindictive and possibly, partially aimed at your parents, as well, for welcoming your bioparents back into the family so easily. I can definitely see how that would feel like a betrayal to you, after what bioparents did to you and your brother, as well as the rest of the family. And, even if it is vindictive, you deserve the right and support to decide how you want to react to the situation. \n\nSo, still NTA. But, I will recommend to try your best not to be an AH to yourself, also. Holding on to resentment and using revenge as a way to deal with tragedy can have some awful effects on a person, esp long term. So, make sure that any choices you make prioritize your health, happiness, and safety. You are the priority!\n\nAs evidenced by you, your brother, and your grandparents, everyone reacts differently to these things. There is nothing wrong with feeling hurt, upset, or wanting NC. There is also nothing wrong with wanting to get to know them or forgiveness, bc those things are also solely for you to gain something. You also don't have to only pick one reaction. You can also change your mind as often as needed, if what you want changes. \n\nNeither resentment, nor forgiveness can change the past and they certainly do not excuse it. Your bioparents were not parents to you. That's simply the reality of it and nothing can change that. Getting to know them now can't undo what has happened. So, if you feel like it would be too painful to know them, now, that's understandable. But, if you ever feel curious about them or want to try knowing them as acquaintances (or friends or family), there is also nothing wrong with that either.", "They did not do \"small things wrong\" to you. They completely and utterly failed you for 25 years. You are not being vindictive. You are responding entirely reasonably. They CAN chose to leave your life literally as soon as was humanly possible. That's their choice, and no one can really do anything about that.  But they can't decide how you should feel or react to them afterwards. They can't chose when you do or don't have parents as they please. When they abandoned you, they abandoned the right/ability to decide their place in your life. You don't owe them forgiveness or love or even respect. You are not bad, angry, violent, or mean for how you react to this, no matter what. If they don't like it, tell them they should've raised you better.", "How is them cutting you off different from them abandoning you for 20 years", "Due to the nature of the previous case,by our countries law I can ask for a cease and desist letter but that is not a restraining order. It is just a warning letter against them saying if you ever come close to me I will accept that as an assault  and I will act according to that.", "OP seems to be of the very strong opinion that the bio parents are not worth even trying to maintain a relationship.  Putting a hard legal boundary is their way of ensuring this does not escalate.", "Is the cease and desist order absolutely necessary? Perhaps not. BUT these are people who abandoned her at birth in a hospital in a foreign country where she had on family. And they came back years latter wanting to play family. I think the order is a totally appropriate act of symbolic rejection directed towards those who walked away from her at her most vulnerable.", "So what happened that lead to that?", "You need to read the previous post. They abandoned her and her twin brother at a hospital in Sri Lanka just after they were born. The people at the hospital worked to find the family to care for the babies.\n\nThe parents basically disappeared for more than 20 years and now want to be forgiven.", "OP is male, not female.", "I've read it.  They seemed quite cordial after the bio parents returned. \n\nSo again, what changed to cause OP to want a restraining order?", "The probably weren't leaving OP alone, after being told to do so.\n\nPaperwork like this is the next step in those cases.", "It was a preventative thing. My lawyer friend said they would continue to pester me or even ambush me at my house so I took this initiative as a primary prevention", "I would hope that's all it was, and not something even more fucked up.", "Your intuition was right"]}
