I really like my buddies wife. I'm not saying it's on a romantic level because I've never allowed myself to actually think about it *like that* but I will say she is exceptionally beautiful, extremely outgoing, fucking hilarious, a genuine sweet heart and very much so a nurturer. My buddy is madly, madly in love with this woman and she is the same with him. Their relationship is down right flipping perfect and Lord knows I have some twangs of jealousy surrounding it because I end up with psychos. \n\nAnywho, my buddy and his wife recently found out they are pregnant and given that the wife is pregnant, she has been super exhausted, irritable (to a point of shocking me, actually) but like.. it's normal. She's pregnant for Christs sake. But my buddy is not taking any of this well. The pregnancy or the change in his wife. He still thinks she is absolutely stunning despite the baby bump but he's in an absolute panic because he didn't exactly ever want children. Well he did, but he was afraid of turning out like his dad, which is really fucking with his head. He's been drinking more and coming over often as an escape. Like finding legitimate excuses to come here instead of being home. Cold feet, I guess. Clara doesn't appear to mind because to be absolutely blunt, she would have shit handled with or without my buddy. She is a super human. But I guess they had a bit of a tiff the other day because he complained to her about the fact that he's going to have to be the only one working for awhile or something. Just made her feel stupid and less than, which he admits to. But he never even apologized to her for making her feel that way. He instead sealed the deal by coming to me about it.\n\nHere's where I may be the AH.. like I said, I really like Clara. I think she's damn near perfect. And it pisses me off that he would tear her down like that AND THEN come to me and make me look like an AH without even apologizing to her. So I told him that he doesn't understand how good he has it with her and that I didn't want him dragging me in the middle of this because he's going to make me look bad and I truly consider her to be one of my best friends (same friend groups, if you're wondering how we all met- known each other for 20 years). He says I'm an AH because I'm his outlet but he's truly making me look like a dick to everyone, including Clara because he runs to me the second he picks a fight with her.", "created_utc": 1678918717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11sb9k9/aita_for_telling_my_buddy_how_good_he_has_it_with/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was his best friend and just acquaintances with Clara until after they hooked up, where I started considering her my best friend as well.

I get being scared he'll be a bad father, but that's no excuse to treat his wife - or his peers - that way.", "NTA, and if more men had friends like you telling him not be such entitled little boys. There would be a lot less divorces", "NTA. \nHe is treating her badly and he knows it.", "NTA. Sometimes, even when we love our friends, we can tell them that they're being jackasses. That's the whole point of having friends, right? Someone to support us through the hard times and someone to give us a small kick in the ass when we need it.", "Was your buddy on here earlier claiming to be mistreated because his wife was mad at her boss? Sounds like you got a crush on Clara but sounds like your buddy needed to be called out too. NTA", "NTA. You're his friend, not his therapist. If you're happy to listen to him and talk him through stuff that's fine, but it sounds like his issues with his dad and alcohol are beyond your paygrade. He needs to talk to a mental health professional.", "NTA. But not your circus, not your monkeys \u2026 tell your buddy to complain to someone else.", "NTA, your friend can't handle the truth, then that's his problem.

So he hangs out with you when (others?) think he should be with his wife? How is that your fault? \n\nI get the feeling that you don't want Clara to think you're on his side. This is emotionally interfering in their relationship too much (or worshiping her too much). You can be both of their friends. You tell him your opinion on his behavior when he asks for it. That is enough.", "NTA, but you're clearly in love with her and in complete denial about it.", "INFO: How is him coming to you making you look like a dick?", "Idk of you are the asshole. But you are kind of getting way to involved. At the end of the day it's their relationship not yours", "Soft YTA, I think you are right and have the right intentions but by come at him telling him he should be great full isn't helpful. \n\nHis feelings and emotions are valid, but yes avoidance and drinking are not ways to handle these issues. \n\nTalking to his wife and finding a ways to confront him in a supportive way, trying to find a healthy way to address these issues would have been a better way to address the issue.\n\nThe only people that knows what goes on in a relationship are the people in it. So stop assuming you know everything, you just sound jealous.", "YTA -for worrying about how you look in all this. Who cares, tell him he needs to apologize and ask for forgiveness and probably do a couple really nice things for her (maybe starting with chocolate and flowers) and don\u2019t worry about how you look, eventually you\u2019ll look good. \n\nNTA - for talking sense into your boy, this is what real friends do. Pointing out real character flaws and help fix them.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to fix whatever is going on with his marriage. Send him home! Continue to hold him accountable! If he needs emotional support then maybe he can partake in some self help, parenting books, therapy, literally anything but the current route. Tell your other friends what your new tactic is so they know you're not putting up with what he's laying down but you're not leaving him to the wolves either.", "NTA for standing up for her. He needs to get his act together.\n\nThat being said, I find it a bit weird how you put her on a pedestal and worry about what she will think of YOU if HE is acting out. Maybe it's all platonic but it reads a bit like unrequited crush and jealousy.\n\nAlso calling other women psychos does make you an AH. Cut that out and maybe think about what you are doing wrong in those relationships. In my experience, if a guy has more than one psycho ex, he is usually the problem.", "Wow. So much to unpack. First off, you don\u2019t end up with psychos, you CHOOSE psychos. Have a pep talk with yourself on why that is because that is 100% a you problem and labelling women as psychos after you CHOSE them is redundant. \n\nSecondly, you\u2019re only seeing as much of their relationship as they want you to see so you can\u2019t judge on whether she\u2019s perfect as a partner to your friend because you don\u2019t date her. Things are always different behind closed doors.\n\nYour friend sounds like a child with no boundaries since he\u2019s having a baby that he doesn\u2019t want. That\u2019s irresponsible and immature. Overall, your friend is being a disrespectful arse and you were right to call him out but not on the things that actually\nImportant. On the other hand, he is venting to you because he clearly feels such and he either wants to change or just whinge. The fact you\u2019re more concerned with \u201clooking bad\u201d than helping your friend look at why he\u2019s so confused and panicky doesn\u2019t make you look great either. Soft YTA", "So, you have a crush on your friend\u2019s wife. NTA, though.", "NAH, But you're focusing too much on the behavior here and not enough on what's causing it, which you've already identified - he's afraid of turning out like his dad. Stop telling him how good he has it and start either getting him to talk to you about those feelings, or, better yet, into therapy so that he can talk about those feelings with a professional. It seems to me that if he can get over his fears and realize he does not have to end up being like his dad, he will stop behaving this way anyway, and if he doesn't, he wont. That seems like a really clear path forward for improving this situation, so I hope he will take it.", "NTA, which doesn't mean that you behaved perfectly.\n\nLook, you're trying to walk a hard line, which is to *both* to support your friend and to gently steer him back towards getting his shit together.\n\nWhatever you said, he *heard* you not-so-gently steering him towards getting his shit together. And that means you should apologize and let him know you always have his back.\n\nThere's a time when we need to sit our friends down and give them a pretty harsh talking to, and there are others when we need to recognize that they're having a very understandable hard moment and our job is to give them space to work through all the shit they're working through - even if some of it sounds ugly when said out loud - so they can get it out of their system and show back up for their partner like a champ.\n\nNobody's going to think that you're the AH because you're his support system. In fact, if he comes to you when he's upset, blows off some steam, and then goes home and shows up with his head on straight, she'll probably think you're awesome! You're helping her solve problems. Rather than seeing yourself as being \"Dragged in the middle\" (which is a negative framing) view it as \"you're the trusted friend who can help him solve problems.\"\n\nIt's *okay* that your buddy needs to vent a bit about the stresses of being a sole breadwinner and all that jazz. In fact, if he needs to vent about that, you should be encouraging him to vent to you about it, rather than get in fights with his wife about it.\n\nThat shit is stressful! But since it's MORE stressful for her, he shouldn't complain to her about it. He should complain to a friend on the side. That's you.\n\nAnd you should be supportive. And yes you should be reminding him how great he has it, how awesome this is going to be, and yes you're validating that his fears are reasonable but also building him up, reminding him that he can DO THIS.\n\nAnd it sounds like you veered more into \"I'm reading you the riot act\" territory, as opposed to, \"I'm your buddy and I love you and I hear how hard this is, but bro, you got this!\" And that doesn't make you the asshole, but it means you didn't ace the friend test with flying colors.", "How are people claiming he isn\u2019t the ah when mans in love with his friends wife. ESH except the pregnant wife", "YTA, because you're obviously, very clearly, in love with your friend's wife.", "Slight YTA.  You clearly have feelings for her, so you should be super-duper careful about talking about how great she is or how lucky he is.  Just try to empathize with him and give him gentle nudges in the right direction instead.\n\nYou should also distance yourself from her and start dating more.", "YTA.  Marriages are hard, marriages during pregnancies are even harder. He is very stressed out right now and came to you, his supposed friend to vent.  Sure, you need to remind him that he has a good thing and that he should be grateful.  But you should be there for him to vent. Give him the slap but also extend the hand.  But you can't do that because you have the hots for his wife and don't want to fuck up how she looks at you.  STOP TRYING TO FUCK YOUR FRIENDS WIFE AND BE THERE FOR HIM!", "YTA\n\nYou are overly focused on ingratiating yourself to your friend's pregnant wife. Your loyalty is to him, not her. \n\nIt's great that you have Clara's best interests in mind, and are able to give him sound advice -- but you lost me when you said \"he's making me look like a dick to everyone\" -- that tells me that you are a little bit delusional here and might have gotten your priorities mixed up.", "YTA - not for encouraging him to show appreciation for his wife you have mutual respect for but for putting this woman on an unhealthy pedestal and giving a friend grief when he's dealing with shit.
