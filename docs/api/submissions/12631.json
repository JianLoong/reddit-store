Fuck that guy. Don't set yourself on fire to keep him warm.\n\nIn other words, don't lie to make his life easier. Keep him away from your kids, stuck in Panama.", "If he really isn't mentally stable, keep him on the passport denial list. He deserves to be there for non-payment of child support anyway. Talking to the kids by correspondence might be the best option here. NTA. You don't owe him a damned thing. He deserted you all.", "NTA. And the thing those kids should be most heartbroken about is that they have a father who would rather flee the country than help financially support them and is now sad that he can't come back because of it.", "NTA, dude shouldn\u2019t have fathered THREE whole children if he wasn\u2019t planning on paying child support and it\u2019s definitely not your responsibility to get him out of the mess he\u2019s put himself into by refusing to pay child support. He brought this on himself and he should live with the consequences of his own actions now. I feel like you\u2019re definitely better off without him and the fact that you say he scares you also makes me think for your safety it\u2019s definitely better if he doesn\u2019t get access back into the US lol", "NTA. Do not lie for him. A revoked passport does not prevent him from returning to the US as long as he is a citizen. It only prevents him from foreign travel in the future. He could not return, visit your kids, then return back to Panama. He made the choice to return to Panama and refuse to work. He could have worked and paid down his debt. He cares more about the money than your kids.", "NTA. Your ex sounds terrible though.", "NTA. He wants to have kids without actually taking care of them. It takes work to be a parent and he doesn't want to or else he would actually make an effort. Hold your ground. He owes you money doesn't deserve to be let back in.", "NTA for not lying for your AH ex.", "NTA. Your ex hurted your children before. And as long as he doesn't show that he has changed (paying the child support and taking responsible) there is no reason to do that. He just want to have verything his way. And might leave your children again as soon as he can come back to the US.", "Hell no, NTA", "NTA. As parents, our obligation is to our children. He chose himself and lost his ability to return to the US. That\u2019s on him. Let him straighten himself out if he wants to resume the role of a father.", "NTA, I don\u2019t want to be brutal but may be a good thing at the end you point out mental instability and scares you. If he really cares he had options, getting on a payment plan, not escape to Panama and face the music.", "NTA.  Your ex didn't fulfill his obligations as a parent and now he's dealing with the consequences.  None of that is your fault.", "NTA. Don't lie on his behalf, there are consequences to his actions and he has to deal with them.", "NTA.  Is there a world where trying to protect yourself and your kids from a violent deadbeat by telling the truth makes you an AH?", "NTA.\n\nHe sounds awful. Keep him away. Protect yourself and your children!", "NTA", "NTA. He knew his responsibilities and ran away.", "NTA. Stay strong.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHe made his choices, he can live with them. Obligations don't just go away when you run away from home.", "NTA he brought it upon himself.", "NTA, its his kids, he should be paying for them. \n\nIts his responsibility and he aperently is not keeping up with them and from your post he never has. \n\nYou go girl for making it work though.", "NTA", "YTA but not for helping the useless human who fathered but refuses to support your children.
