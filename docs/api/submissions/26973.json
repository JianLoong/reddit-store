We started dating just before the covid lockdowns and I moved to the country she was living in to be with her. My bank account and work permit were not fully sorted when everything shut down so my salary was paid into her account. \n\nWe both ended up losing our jobs so went together to my country and lived there. While we were in my home I paid for everything and the spoken understanding was that she would pay me back (she is a professional with money, more than me). \n\nAfter 2 years the pressure of everything was too much and I left her and she agreed that she would pay me back 20,000 dollars (my salary and living costs). Since the day I left her she hasn't replied to any messages and hasn't paid me back. I have spoken to lawyers who suggested I email her contacts to find out her whereabouts to begin legal procedures. \n\nI am debating whether I email all of her family members, friends and past and present employers explaining the situation and that I need to contact her with a court summons. \n\nShe is a very private person and would be horrified by this but after no contact for almost 2 years I am at a loss of what else to do. WIBTA?\n\nEdit to add - we were both assholes at the end of the relationship and it ended on bitter terms. I kinda bailed on her and I know that I could have handled things in a better way and her ego was super hurt.\n\nEdit again - we are pretty International people and from different countries. She was paid my salary in one country, we are now both in other countries. Basically a laywer has said it will be very difficult due to laws of different countries and neither of us are from USA so suing people isnt really a thing in our respective countries. No contracts were signed and it is all her word against mine hence I want to take her to court.\n\nAlso shaming on social media in the title is actually incorrect on my part. I would individually make contact with everyone I know who is connected to her explaining the situation and try to gather her whereabouts. I have a fair idea where she is and where she works but no proof.", "created_utc": 1694867436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16k6ebt/wibta_for_shaming_my_ex_on_social_media_after_she/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She used you for your money, did not contribute her fair share, then stole from you. If she wants to avoid shame for the reality of what she did, she could always just pay you back.", "NTA for wanting the money back, but did you guys sign any contracts that stated she would have to pay it back? It might be tough to get it back - also tbh if I was a family member or employer I wouldn\u2019t give out her address because I wouldn\u2019t want to be involved in this matter.", "What you mention in the text \"email her contacts\" is very different than the \"shaming on social media\" in the title. Email is not social media and asking for her contact info is not shaming her.\n\nWhat else to do would be to hire a skip tracer who would get her address for you.\n\nI'm at a loss for the judgment. The action in the  title would make you an asshole, the action in the text would not.", "INFO: If I have this right, she lost her job, the two of you moved back to your place, you agreed to pay all basic living expenses because she was unemployed, you were in an intimate relationship, and you both thought at some point she would pay you back. You had a nasty breakup, and now she wants no contact. You say the $20k was \u201cyour salary plus living costs.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t you have incurred much of those living costs (rent, utilities) anyway? Sure, you likely purchased more food, but you didn\u2019t have to invite her to live with you. Is she working now? Did she agree to the $ when you were fighting?", "Social media shaming amongst a friendship or social circle is such a dire move yw bta. However, if you are simply trying to make contact to initiate proceedings and keep the details to yourself - NTA.You need to watch some Judge Judy for advice about debts which are \"a spoken understanding\" - she'd send you away.", "Ywbta.  She didn't steal anything from you.  \n\nYou two were in a relationship. You made the decision to pay for everything for her. Enough though you said she made more money than you did. \n\nIf you have proof that this money was a loan and not just you spending money on her in a relationship. Then sue her.", "YWBTA.  If you think you have legal recourse to go after her for the money, talk to a lawyer. They\u2019ll know how to find a person if you have the proof that this was a loan. You already bailed on her and know she was badly hurt (not her ego - her!) so why do you want to double down and hurt her more?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
