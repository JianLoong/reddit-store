I do understand your side but I also understand your parents. I was so anxious about my husband riding his motorcycle especially after my brother had a bad accident. It only stopped after I started riding with my husband and realized that he is a safe driver. Still we needed clear boundaries. Maybe those would help your parents: buy yourself good protection gear (my brother is only alive because he had high quality protection), text your mum as soon as you arrived your destination, don't drive while rain or snow or if you absolutely need to make sure your parents don't know. Part of seeing your children grow up is realizing that you can't protect them from every harm. And motorcycles are especially dangerous. Not because of mistakes you might make but because there are stupid car drivers out there who are really risking the life of motorcycle drivers. My husband stopped driving after our son was born because he had a different responsibility now. Your feelings are absolutely validated but your parents fears as well. Making you responsible for their divorce on the other hand is absolutely shitty. I think they are just blowing their feelings up to guilt trip you.
