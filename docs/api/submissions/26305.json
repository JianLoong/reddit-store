Wedding cakes are usually disgusting anyway with all of the fondant on them so nobody\u2019s missing out by not having one. A regular sheet cake with real frosting sounds amazing.", "NTA. Any cake served at a wedding is wedding cake.\n\nI have been to weddings with just one cake, multi-tiered cakes, several sheet cakes, a separate small cake for the bride and groom, cup cakes, no cake, you name it.  The only time I heard anyone say anything other than \"This cake is really good\" was the time there was no cake at all (even then, it was just a slightly disappointed comment about not getting cake, the rest of the wedding was great).  \n\nIf anyone gets hung up on the idea that there isn't just one massive cake for everyone, they were looking to find something to complain about. If it wasn't the cake, it would be the music, or the lighting, or the table cloth, or that they are upset because they missed out on the irony of rain on your wedding day, or..... well, you get the point. Do your thing, it sounds awesome!", "NTA. This is a very common trend lately. A small, highly decorated cake for photos and the bride and groom to cut, and sheet cake/cupcakes/bars/torte/whatever other desserts for the rest of the guests.", "NTA  \n\n\nI didn't even have a tiered cake, we just had sheet cake from Costco.  It was delicious, no one minded and our wedding was fantastic.  This matters ZERO percent. Do what you want.   \n\n\nDisregard tradition. Only assholes care.", "You are trying to accommodate as many allergies/sensitivities as possible by getting multiple cakes. How could that offend people?\n\nAlso, tradition is just peer pressure from dead people. It's your wedding, do whatever makes you happy and ignore everything else.\n\nP.s. make sure you assign someone to deal with any \"issues\" on the day, so you are not bothered if anything crops up.

My friends did something similar at their wedding. There were 8 single tier cakes (1 cake per guest table) and a total of 3 different kind of cakes (1 was full vegan, 1 was lactose free and others \"regular\" cakes). They told all the guests who had allergies or a special diet which cake was safe to eat (the cakes looked different so no chance of confusing them). The bride and groom went to each table and cut open the first slice. Then the guests cut the rest of the cake open and served themselves. \n\nI think it was a lovely idea and avoided big queues of people waiting in line for the cake. Everyone remained seated and waited for the bride and groom to come to their table.", "NTA -- sounds great to me", "NTA.\n\nIt's your wedding, do what you want. Not everyone can afford everything but you're still doing your best. I think you're being very considerate, it's nice. \n\n\"Tradition\" is a stupid reason that doesn't excuse the fact there are OFTEN more practical alternatives. Don't do something you can't afford or maybe don't even want to do just because it's TrAdiTiOnAl. Unless you're a virgin wearing white, your fianc\u00e9 paid a handsome dowry, and your guests are planning on tossing rice at you to grant you fertility, maybe people can keep their traditional wedding ideas to themselves and leave you be.\n\nYou have way too much to stress about and don't need to give yourself something else.

Im not a fan of this current huge wedding culture, so I was expecting some outlandish post, but you are being very programatic and considerate to everyone's allergies.\nYou can try discussing in the bakery if its possible to have it \"look like one Cake\" (like several layers or levels) but actually be diferente ones. As long as its safe, allergy wise, of course, and YOU care about tradition (or your family views on tradition). Anyway, my advice is to just not go into details when talking about the cake to other people, people will only make you second Guess decisions.", "NTA \n\nQuite thoughtful, actually. \n\nSince you're looking out for individual needs...why not go with cupcakes?\n\nI've seen some gorgeous cupcake displays at various events like weddings, showers, bday parties, work events, etc.", "Why wouldn\u2019t you have your specialty cake for your needs and then a standard, larger cake more economical for everyone else. For the ceremony, cut your small special cake and then serve everyone else a slice of regular.

I assume you\u2019re not talking about ordering a four-tier gluten-free cake for you to cut but then saving five years\u2019 worth of cake for yourself instead of serving it to your guests. \n\nThe cake is usually wheeled away for serving after the couple does the cake cutting anyway, so no one is really going to cake about which cake was cut up to put a slice on the plate they take from the dessert table.  Do a small round for you and your husband to cut, and then go with your sheet cake idea to slice for everyone else.  Maybe that\u2019s what you\u2019re already talking about?  If so, I don\u2019t get why your friend is upset, because as someone who isn\u2019t gluten-free, I would probably skip the gluten-free cake because I tend not to care for them, and would happily take a slice of regular sheet cake instead.", "NTA.  I think this is a good solution if there are several different allergies to take into account.", "NTA.  The fact that you are even thinking of different allergies and cross contamination is proof of this. And the fact that those allergies exist in multiples means that whatever cake you cut as a couple, it is highly likely not to be a cake that everyone can eat. You are being mindful of your guests and their well-being - I think that trumps any tradition.", "NTA\n\nAnyone who whinges about cake is to be ignored.", "NTA. You make a very good point thst all your guests may not be able to eat the same thing. So, a small cake that will not make you I\u2019ll, and sheet cakes or a larger cake for your guests.", "NTA, this is a great idea and very thoughtful. Many people could have different sorts of allergies or could even be vegans for example. So, having multiple options would make sure that everyone gets something and is not left out.", "NTA - A lot of people get a smaller wedding cake and then put out sheet cakes to allow for options, and to save money. As long as people get cake, they usually don't care how pretty it was before it was thrown on a plate. Your friend needs to mind her own business, not her wedding, not her cake. Personally, I wouldn't want a friend who gets so easily offended.", "NTA ---- IF you go about this a nice way.\n\nIt's not that you aren't serving everyone wedding cake. It's that you are serving a VARIETY of different cakes to cater to different allergies.   Your friend is upset because she seems to think you won't be serving cake to your guests. But you WILL be.\n\nSo you can have a small one for you and your husband called a \"wedding cake,\" and then OTHER cakes that are also \"wedding cakes\" and labeled with ingredients.   \n\n\nEven better: A cake you can eat in the middle, surrounded by cupcakes catering to different other allergies.  \n\n\nWhatever you choose, a good baker should be able to make a beautiful presentation.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like a ingenious plan.\n\nThe last wedding I went to, the official cake was served to the bride and groom, but there just so many people and so very good sheet cake was also served.  It's a matter of feeding everyone.  Not everyone can eat nuts. strawberries, lemon, chocolate, etc.", "NTA - I\u2019m guessing she won\u2019t be left out if you only have a \u201cnormal\u201d cake?", "Your friend is silly. Cake is cake, who cares which cake the slice came from?\n\nNTA.", "NTA, you have celiac disease, and for those of us that understand making a cake with GF flour (in a special kitchen with no risk of cross contamination) is both an art and a science and it is expensive and difficult.\n\nYour friend hasn\u2019t lived your life has she?

The problem with the allergies is that there's also someone allergic to eggs which is a problem with gluten free cakes, as they tend to rely on the stability a beaten eggwhite offers. Of course it would be possible to make a cake taking all allergies into consideration, but it would a) not taste as good as different ones for different allergies and b) be more expensive since the bakery we will be getting our gluten free cake from would have to ensure they're not working with nuts on the day of making our cake and they'd have to deep clean their workspaces to ensure no traces of nuts to be present.", "Nah, deep fried is the way to go.", "Hilarious.", "I really enjoy that Natalie Sideserf makes all her hyper-realistic cakes using modeling chocolate -- she proves that fondant isn't necessary for fancy sculpted stuff.

For every one person \u201coffended\u201d they didn\u2019t get a slice of your actual cutting cake, I bet you get 4 thanking you for thinking of their needs.

So we had all the food info cards in the buffet labeled with whether there was eggs (mostly, it was no eggs). My friend came up to me asking who else was allergic to eggs. I said \u201cno one, just you\u201d.

That's my first and foremost advice to couples. Just because something is traditional to others doesn't mean it is to you. I have had clients who had a small cake for themselves and then something else for their guests. My advice would be, make sure whoever is baking these cakes, has a dedicated allergy free kitchen. I make some allergy free items, like GF, nut free, egg free etc but I do not have an allergy free kitchen, my kitchen is conventional. I make people very aware of that. I myself have celiac and do a crazy thorough cleaning because I still eat out of that kitchen. \n\nSecondly, if you were my clients I would advise against having different cakes for each persons allergy requirements. It sounds like you have a lot of people with different types of allergies. Unless you have a coordinator or caterer or really both who is dedicating their time to making sure the right cakes are properly labeled, I would not do it. People are usually a little bit tipsy by cake time. People do not pay attention to little signs. Those little signs can easily get mixed up. You would be surprised how shitty some guests can be. Something that they think is, \"a little joke\" like moving a sign can be deadly. Someone having a medical emergency at your wedding would put a massive stop to everything and I doubt you want that to happen. Also, unless people are being plated dessert, which it doesn't sound like it, then those cakes are there for anyone to touch. \n\nI have made a cake for the couple and then individual cupcakes for people at the wedding who had allergies. This honestly is probably the safest way when we are talking about full fledged allergies. One wedding I had a cake for the couple, a main cake for normal guests, and then some gf cupcakes and egg free cupcakes for allergy people. The allergy specific items were boxed, labeled, and not put out with the other items. The coordinator wrote the names of the people who got those specific items. \n\nYou can obviously do what you think is best but wedding days can be chaotic sometimes and I would be concerned about someone getting the wrong item by accident. \n\nGood luck and Congratulations!", "NTA and I think it's very considerate of you to plan with other guests allergies in mind.

The guest were all serve sheet cake cuz it's easier to produce and store for large groups of people", "This is exactly what my baker did. The top part was edible, the rest was just for show. She had a separate cake done for the guests that was in the back. It was absolutely cheaper and is done at many weddings.", "Huh, I have never seen that", "What? You weren't allowed to eat at a party that was supposedly thrown in your honor?", "This sounds like the perfect solution to op's dilemma, an individual wedding cake for the couple, and cupcakes decorated differently depending on allergens and sensitivities. That way everyone is included with their own personal cake.", "My god, a s\u2019more bar at a wedding! I wouldn\u2019t even be mad about going to a dry wedding I if it had a s\u2019more bar. What an unexpected delight it would have been.", "My sister had pies and other desserts. Neither she or her husband like cake. \nI did cupcakes because it was 1) way less expensive and 2) required no monitoring.", "Yeah and so is the joke, but I can explain it for u if u like", "Phase two: \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Deep fried ice cream is a thing\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tsfriedscoop/%3Fhl%3Den-gb&ved=2ahUKEwjJ66OCr5aBAxUGSMAKHZedAMwQFnoECBoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1Pp9EAYwPSVZnpZoLCiuoY", "Most batters work just as well subbing ap flour for almond flour(provided no one has but allergies)", "We had a donut tower at my wedding too! We had 4 tiers of donuts, then a little cake on top for just us. It was awesome because neither me or my husband really like cake, but we love donuts. Plus we sent the leftovers home with family and friends who helped us so they had easy breakfast in the morning. It was a huge hit!", "Lol excellent point, can I skip the wedding?", "LMAO no. And to be perfectly honest,  other than the hog roas and cupcakes I don't even remember what was there to eat.\n\nalso, I didn't even get to take extra home and it would have been nice since we had out of town guests at our house and lived 3.5 hours away from where the party was hosted. \n\nSo we drove back home and ravaged some fast food in our car on the way back with our guests", "Oh a s'mores bar would have been a hit...how do I know? Because my mom had one THE NEXT FREAKING YEAR for my brother's graduation.", "Not a cake fan either which is why we chose donuts. My nan offered to pay for the cake and I said 'its likely going to be donuts' and obviously she knew I wasn't a cake fan anyway and her response was so positive and she encouraged me to do my own thing for my day", "Not being allowed to partake in a hog roast is just cruel. I've only ever been to one in my life when I was about 5 (over 30 years ago) and I still remember how good that pig was!", "Why weren't you allowed to eat or take any extras home?", "A) I\u2019m not surprised it was a hit! \n\nB) Why is your moon like that??", "One of my fav weddings had a pie table due to the bride hating cake. There were so many fun flavours of pie. Everyone loved it! I've seen donuts, cupcakes, and sheet cakes along with the more traditional wedding cake and never heard a comment against any. Except people of course hate fondant...which, fair.", "Yeah they used to do them for customer appreciation days where I grew up. What a terrible host. If someone told me I had to go play nice with strangers but couldn't eat the food and watch everyone else eat after driving 3+ hours, I wouldn't have gone. What's the point if you don't even get free food? This sounds like a weird exercise in narcissism", "Well, my mom hated me to begin with. Secondly, she was all about control and this was something she could control.", "What the hell was her reason she gave for not \"allowing\" you to eat?! \n\n\"You suck, no food for you!\" ?", "Well, if it helps I now hate your mom. She sounds super controlling and kind of sadistic. I would have not showed up at the party.", "I respect the fact that you didn't eat anything.   \n\n\nI'll tell you what though, i wish someone had tried to keep me from eating. I'd ruin your mom's whole night by getting a plate, telling her how good its tastes with a smile knowing how much of an AH she'd look to everyone else if she complains about me eating.", "\"People are here to SEE YOU, YOU NEED to be available ALL DAY, not eating and avoiding everyone.\"", "I vote we all get together to throw a party, invite their mom, and then not let them eat to see how they like it", "Oh you nailed it. She fits a very classic definition of narcissism.", "Your friend needs to be told she can pay for the wedding cake you want and when half the guests have bad reactions, she can also pick up their medical bills.  I think your plan is brilliant and resolves the issue nicely for everyone.  You do you, friend can kick rocks.", "No,  NTA. If you were only getting yourself and your fiance a cake, then yeah, but you're getting a bunch of cakes that everyone should be able to find one they like. I think that's way better than just getting stuck with 1 fancy cake that not even l everyone will even like.", "Originally, wedding cake was a heap of smaller cakes, generally fruit cake, sometimes decorated with sugar paste. Of course, back then brides still wore red (with a blue hem for Mary).\n\nThe white dress and big cake thing is Victorian.", "> \u201cTell your friend to grab a snickers.\u201d\n\n#\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "Oh good lord, our baker practically made us sign a waiver that we wouldn\u2019t slam her in online reviews that the cake wasn\u2019t picture perfect after we said we wanted a cake with buttercream frosting instead of fondant. I hardly knew what the damn it tasted like until a year later because we got like two bites of cake in before we had to do more wedding stuff, so I ordered a small cake with the same flavors for our first anniversary.", "We did the same with the Costco cakes.\n\nTacos, beer, karaoke, and cake. It was fun!", "Gluten free or celiac-safe? Vast difference between the two.", "My sister had a small.cske for her and her husband, and cake pops for guests in several flavors. It was a big hit.", "We had a two tier white cake as our wedding cake and I expressly said no fondant, all buttercream.  It looked beautiful.  The first baker we talked to was a little miffed he couldn\u2019t use fondant so we chose a smaller family run bakery and she said no problem.  She also made cupcakes in a variety of flavors that where decorated similar to the cake.  She was awesome and the cake and cupcakes where so delicious.", "As far as I\u2019m concerned, the only tradition that is essential for a wedding is that you are married by the end of it. Anything else is optional.", "My family acts like I'm trying to kill them if I offer a bite of GF food.  Except my chocolate chip cookies, they prefer those to the real thing.", "or have cupcakes made for everyone else. That's another popular option.", "I had a super traditional wedding. It was even suggested by our wedding planner to just cut a small cake and have the catering people cut and serve a sheet cake to the guests because we were serving like 200 people.  Granted all of our wedding cake was chantilly cake from Whole Foods, but not a single judgemental old Southern Lady complained about the cake.", "This is the way. Put the fancy gluten free cake on top of faux decorated tiered cake, do the cake cutting thing. Then have them \u201cwheel it back to cut it\u201d and have caterer bring out the precut sheet cakes for the buffet. Don\u2019t tell your friends/family who are \u201ctraditional\u201d what you did. Let them have their dreams lol.", "In the past ten years, I think I've only been to one wedding that had a super fancy but gross wedding cake. The rest have been very pretty,plenty of tiers and decor-while also not being dried pieces of fondant. My sister's was a four tier from Buttercream, each tier was a different flavor. So. Good. \nNow I want wedding cake.", "My friend did this at his wedding last year. Show cake was frosted foam with a real top tier for cutting, sheet cake for everyone else. Literally no one cared, and was infinitely cheaper.", "I should join that sub. HATE fondant.", "I know right. I love fondant.", "I've been to a couple of weddings this summer. They both had an assortment of pastries, cake, cupcakes, brownies, etc to choose from including vegan and gluten-free options. My favorite was a s'mores brownie and close runner up was baklava. I don't really love cake to begin with, so I was quite happy to have so many options for dessert. I thought it was very considerate of both sets of partners to be so thoughtful to their guests and their varying food preferences/allergies.", "A tip from an old lady:  When you are shopping for supplies, NEVER go to any place that specializes in weddings.  If you order directly and have to specify what it's for, it isn't a wedding.  It's a big family party.  It's a thank-you party for everybody who helped you and your SO out over the years.  Both of these are the truth.  They are also ways to avoid the wedding markup, which, the last time I checked, ranged from 10 to 40 percent!", "Ok so what you're doing is completely normal. Maybe there was miscommunication with the person who was upset about it. You're getting cake for everyone. You're not only getting cake for you and your spouse. There's literally nothing even remotely unusual about this besides the fact that your piece will be gluten-free.", "Well, now I know she\u2019s wrong. It would seem incredibly rude to deny certain guests cake and be okay with it. You keep with your plan, OP, because your way makes everyone feel valued, which is going to be one of the takeaways for every guest, beyond your wedding/reception being something everyone will remember fondly.", "Ignore these people say it's rude, or not inclusive. It is EXTREMELY common for the guests to have slices of sheet cake, and the top tier is for the bride and groom. I have seen this at multiple weddings I've been to.", "Even her relationship with you!  Who cares that much about tradition but doesn't even want a relationship?", "Okay. Making note of THAT cake because that flavor combo sounds DELISH.", "One of my friends doesn\u2019t really like cake so she and her husband did small cheesecakes in varying flavors. Sooo good!", "I got piles of mini cupcakes. Everyone got to try whatever flavors they wanted and they were super easy to send a box of 2-3 home with people as they left. I didn't get stuck with a billion pounds of cake and everyone enjoyed it. Cupcakes or any sweet that's already pre-serving size is the best option for weddings to me.", "We did the same thing, fewer flavors and different flavors lol.\n\nOn the other hand, I've also left a wedding reception because they didn't serve cake to the guests (family that doesn't like us anyway, and they're also divorced now so it really doesn't matter if we left the wedding!)", "Yeah I wouldn't want to go with a baker put out from being refused fondant. That stuff is just nasty and to me screams someone who doesn't have the artistry or skill to handle buttercream.\n\nWe only had a small wedding - like 30 people - so I just wanted to have fun with a variety of cakes so people could enjoy flavors they liked. My favorite was like a peanut-butter cup-type cake with peanut butter and chocolate drizzles, but we also had an Italian sweet cream, chocolate with raspberry liqueur, strawberry shortcake, etc. Folks really seemed to enjoy the variety.", "I had an ice cream truck. My husband and I did have an itty-bitty cake just so we could do the whole cut the cake feed each other, but literally no one complained about the ice cream truck.", "We did a cookie food truck, and they had a gluten free option--and we kept it nut free (no celiacs, but my nephew can't have nuts at all).", "My SO\u2019s cousin had several wheels of cheese stacked like a cake and everyone went home with some of the best cheeses Ireland has to offer.", "Or have it in several stacks, so you can call it one big wedding cake, with the top being your mini gluten free one, the second the one catering to others' allergies and if you need more a thirst bottom cake for all the regular eaters.\n\nIt's silly, but if it save you drama on your wedding day, trick them.", "Typically the cheap sheet cake tastes better anyway", "I know of a wedding for a bride and groom who did not do sweets for reasons.  So they served a glorious multi-layer (on supports) savory cheesecake with fancy crackers and little toasts.", "We got married in August (because my husband wanted his kids there and they lived in Canada at the time) I wish I had thought of ice cream.", "I love fondant. Cheap one is good. Expensive ones are heaven.", "Hard agree. Few years back, I bought a pack of different colours of fondant from Michaels and made edible clay sculptures with my daughter. They were delicious.", "I relate, traditional stuff is out for us too. We\u2019ve been engaged for 10 yrs, we already have two teenagers \u2014 been best friends for 20 yrs so it\u2019s already all \u201cbackwards\u201d by the standard of old judgemental aunts in my partner\u2019s family! \n\nYour ideas sound like a lot of fun! \n\n- I\u2019m not having a ring in a traditional sense,  just a token one for the ceremony and to keep in a box (I get allergic to wearing rings, not worth the rash, so I\u2019m having an initial tattooed on my finger.) \n- My dress is knee length and fuchsia pink\n- I\u2019m walking down the aisle to Smashing Pumpkins (on my own, dad is alive and we get on but I don\u2019t like or need the \u201cgiving away\u201d element\n- our best man is AFAB (one of our kids)\n- we\u2019re not having the bouquet toss or first dance\u2026 just a short sweet ceremony and then 2 hours of dancing to 90s RNB bangers with an open bar. Don\u2019t need much else!", "It was!! Honestly once I tried the malted chocolate buttercream, we built the cake around it lol. I told the bakery I wanted to include that buttercream and they suggested the cake flavors and fillings they do that would compliment.", "Cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts, so I absolutely love that. My mother makes me one for my birthday every year and I make sure to freeze individual slices so I can have it whenever the fancy strikes.", "Been to a wedding with one. It was amazing \ud83e\udd29\n\nMy recommendation to OP is cupcakes. Super easy to customize for allergies & easier than sheet cake.", "It\u2019s hit or miss, we had friends do this for their wedding and those donuts were super stale.", "Especially with the ability to rappel down to the zone of sugar dusted yeasty goodness and then dive into the 32 degree milk pool.", "Only if they\u2019re Krispy Kareem\u2019s that are still hot..maple from Dunkin\u2026or any kind from Tim Hortons.", "A wedding I went to last summer also had a wall of donuts. I definitely appreciated the vibes by the icing did not last long in the July heat. It melted and ran everywhere. Still good though.", "That sounds amazing.", "We did cupcakes with raspberry filling; they were awesome and way cheaper than getting a traditional wedding cake.", "May your inbox be full of bewbs\u2764\ufe0f", "Making this cake for the holidays\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Any time I deem acceptable", "Much neater,too", "This made me laugh, and I hate donuts.  No offense to the donut people - actually, I love the donut idea in place of a wedding cake, it's very fun.  It's just that I had a summer job at a bakery when I was 17 and I've hated donuts ever since (*no, not for any gross reason that would ruin your day - just because I was surrounded by donuts for the entire summer of 1981*).", "Ooh dat nasty", "CINNAHOLICS is both a problem and a blessing", "Yep, and I've seen people suppleme t the cake with decorated cookies and cupcakes, too. As long as you give the people sugar, who cares?", "Make the smaller tier gluten free, and cut that one. Other tiers do not have to be even cake. They can be styrofoam if cross contamination is a problem. \n\nThe guests cake.. cheaper, with nuts and gluten \u2026can be left in the kitchen, and cut and served from there.", "Usually the sheet cake is served from the back at least that\u2019s the way I\u2019ve seen it done", "Right? Wth is this lunacy?

LOL", "Mmmm\u2026I would much rather eat pie rather than cake\u2026.or a nice blueberry cobbler!", "My friend went to a wedding and the cake tower was three \u201crounds\u201d of cheese- they cut up the cheese and served it on a platter along with some other dessert bites (it actually looked quite pretty, like a three tiered cake)", "Oh, I was the scapegoat child...and perceived as \"the black sheep\", so she'd only come out looking smug and correct...like  \"See, she IS exactly as I tell everyone.\" \n\nIt's a no win situation to be honest.", "TRADITION IS JUST PEER PRESSURE FROM DEAD PEOPLE!!! I want that on a sticker", "My guess is this \"friend\" isn't one of the people with a food allergy.", "It\u2019s a fact of life that you can\u2019t have a wedding without offending a few people, you just gotta accept it and move on", "I love this idea! Going to steal for my wedding", "We had a small wedding, too (under 30 people). We did 3-4 dozen cupcakes and a 6\" round for us to cut. Everyone enjoyed it in our case!", "My husband and I went to six weddings in one year, and the only one with cake that I remembered was the one that ordered several dozen mini bundt cakes. I ended up doing the same for ours.", "We did baklava and tiramisu.  What guest would complain about baklava?", "If you want a more photogenic cake, ask the bakery if they can do a tiered cake with dummy cakes as the base. \n\nThis is super common in weddings now: a decorated tiered cake with only one layer of real cake, cut for the photos and just for the bride and groom to eat. \n\nThen the caterers take that cake away, have slices of sheet cake coming out of the kitchen and boom: everyone gets cake, but no one knows it was sheet cake!", "I know of a wedding where that didn\u2019t happen.
