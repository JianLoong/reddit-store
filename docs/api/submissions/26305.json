Wedding cakes are usually disgusting anyway with all of the fondant on them so nobody\u2019s missing out by not having one. A regular sheet cake with real frosting sounds amazing.", "NTA. Any cake served at a wedding is wedding cake.\n\nI have been to weddings with just one cake, multi-tiered cakes, several sheet cakes, a separate small cake for the bride and groom, cup cakes, no cake, you name it.  The only time I heard anyone say anything other than \"This cake is really good\" was the time there was no cake at all (even then, it was just a slightly disappointed comment about not getting cake, the rest of the wedding was great).  \n\nIf anyone gets hung up on the idea that there isn't just one massive cake for everyone, they were looking to find something to complain about. If it wasn't the cake, it would be the music, or the lighting, or the table cloth, or that they are upset because they missed out on the irony of rain on your wedding day, or..... well, you get the point. Do your thing, it sounds awesome!", "NTA. This is a very common trend lately. A small, highly decorated cake for photos and the bride and groom to cut, and sheet cake/cupcakes/bars/torte/whatever other desserts for the rest of the guests.", "NTA  \n\n\nI didn't even have a tiered cake, we just had sheet cake from Costco.  It was delicious, no one minded and our wedding was fantastic.  This matters ZERO percent. Do what you want.   \n\n\nDisregard tradition. Only assholes care.", "You are trying to accommodate as many allergies/sensitivities as possible by getting multiple cakes. How could that offend people?\n\nAlso, tradition is just peer pressure from dead people. It's your wedding, do whatever makes you happy and ignore everything else.\n\nP.s. make sure you assign someone to deal with any \"issues\" on the day, so you are not bothered if anything crops up.

My friends did something similar at their wedding. There were 8 single tier cakes (1 cake per guest table) and a total of 3 different kind of cakes (1 was full vegan, 1 was lactose free and others \"regular\" cakes). They told all the guests who had allergies or a special diet which cake was safe to eat (the cakes looked different so no chance of confusing them). The bride and groom went to each table and cut open the first slice. Then the guests cut the rest of the cake open and served themselves. \n\nI think it was a lovely idea and avoided big queues of people waiting in line for the cake. Everyone remained seated and waited for the bride and groom to come to their table.", "NTA -- sounds great to me", "NTA.\n\nIt's your wedding, do what you want. Not everyone can afford everything but you're still doing your best. I think you're being very considerate, it's nice. \n\n\"Tradition\" is a stupid reason that doesn't excuse the fact there are OFTEN more practical alternatives. Don't do something you can't afford or maybe don't even want to do just because it's TrAdiTiOnAl. Unless you're a virgin wearing white, your fianc\u00e9 paid a handsome dowry, and your guests are planning on tossing rice at you to grant you fertility, maybe people can keep their traditional wedding ideas to themselves and leave you be.\n\nYou have way too much to stress about and don't need to give yourself something else.

Im not a fan of this current huge wedding culture, so I was expecting some outlandish post, but you are being very programatic and considerate to everyone's allergies.\nYou can try discussing in the bakery if its possible to have it \"look like one Cake\" (like several layers or levels) but actually be diferente ones. As long as its safe, allergy wise, of course, and YOU care about tradition (or your family views on tradition). Anyway, my advice is to just not go into details when talking about the cake to other people, people will only make you second Guess decisions.", "NTA \n\nQuite thoughtful, actually. \n\nSince you're looking out for individual needs...why not go with cupcakes?\n\nI've seen some gorgeous cupcake displays at various events like weddings, showers, bday parties, work events, etc.", "Why wouldn\u2019t you have your specialty cake for your needs and then a standard, larger cake more economical for everyone else. For the ceremony, cut your small special cake and then serve everyone else a slice of regular.

I assume you\u2019re not talking about ordering a four-tier gluten-free cake for you to cut but then saving five years\u2019 worth of cake for yourself instead of serving it to your guests. \n\nThe cake is usually wheeled away for serving after the couple does the cake cutting anyway, so no one is really going to cake about which cake was cut up to put a slice on the plate they take from the dessert table.  Do a small round for you and your husband to cut, and then go with your sheet cake idea to slice for everyone else.  Maybe that\u2019s what you\u2019re already talking about?  If so, I don\u2019t get why your friend is upset, because as someone who isn\u2019t gluten-free, I would probably skip the gluten-free cake because I tend not to care for them, and would happily take a slice of regular sheet cake instead.", "NTA.  I think this is a good solution if there are several different allergies to take into account.", "NTA.  The fact that you are even thinking of different allergies and cross contamination is proof of this. And the fact that those allergies exist in multiples means that whatever cake you cut as a couple, it is highly likely not to be a cake that everyone can eat. You are being mindful of your guests and their well-being - I think that trumps any tradition.", "NTA\n\nAnyone who whinges about cake is to be ignored.", "NTA. You make a very good point thst all your guests may not be able to eat the same thing. So, a small cake that will not make you I\u2019ll, and sheet cakes or a larger cake for your guests.", "NTA, this is a great idea and very thoughtful. Many people could have different sorts of allergies or could even be vegans for example. So, having multiple options would make sure that everyone gets something and is not left out.", "NTA - A lot of people get a smaller wedding cake and then put out sheet cakes to allow for options, and to save money. As long as people get cake, they usually don't care how pretty it was before it was thrown on a plate. Your friend needs to mind her own business, not her wedding, not her cake. Personally, I wouldn't want a friend who gets so easily offended.", "NTA ---- IF you go about this a nice way.\n\nIt's not that you aren't serving everyone wedding cake. It's that you are serving a VARIETY of different cakes to cater to different allergies.   Your friend is upset because she seems to think you won't be serving cake to your guests. But you WILL be.\n\nSo you can have a small one for you and your husband called a \"wedding cake,\" and then OTHER cakes that are also \"wedding cakes\" and labeled with ingredients.   \n\n\nEven better: A cake you can eat in the middle, surrounded by cupcakes catering to different other allergies.  \n\n\nWhatever you choose, a good baker should be able to make a beautiful presentation.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like a ingenious plan.\n\nThe last wedding I went to, the official cake was served to the bride and groom, but there just so many people and so very good sheet cake was also served.  It's a matter of feeding everyone.  Not everyone can eat nuts. strawberries, lemon, chocolate, etc.", "NTA - I\u2019m guessing she won\u2019t be left out if you only have a \u201cnormal\u201d cake?", "Your friend is silly. Cake is cake, who cares which cake the slice came from?\n\nNTA.", "NTA, you have celiac disease, and for those of us that understand making a cake with GF flour (in a special kitchen with no risk of cross contamination) is both an art and a science and it is expensive and difficult.\n\nYour friend hasn\u2019t lived your life has she?

Both far tastier options than overpriced fondant cake", "Some people look for things to be offended by.", "The last wedding I was at had a donut wall for guests. It was fantastic!", "Being coeliac myself im very aware of cross contamination.. putting different cakes too close together, especially with having one above the other is bound to have crumbs at the other cake, making it inedible for the person with dietary restrictions. Looks nice for sure but not a good idea for practical reasons \ud83d\ude05", "my brother had a cupcake display instead of a cake and it was lovely", "Cupcakes tend to be more expensive than sheet cakes, just saying.", "The caterer is going to provide the sheet cakes while our small one tier cake would be done in a gluten free bakery to ensure that it isn't contaminated, which the caterer can ensure with the other dishes, but not their cakes. The caterer thought to just put the sheet cakes on one end of the buffet with the other desserts and have people choose which one to get, while we have ours on our table to ceremoniously cut and feed each other and then go in for a second slice if we like. We'll take some home and freeze it to eat on our 6 week anniversary, as is also a tradition here.", "This is the answer.  I would go colour coded to make sure everyone knows the difference \n\nCongratulations on your wedding \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc95", "The caterer offered to do the sheet cakes, that's why I wanted to go for that. They can't offer gluten free cake though (other gluten free food is no problem) so our cake would be done by a gluten free bakery.", "Yeah I made sure to ask everyone their allergies on their responses so that we can cater to everyone. As someone with celiacs, a milk allergy and a soy allergy I hate being invited to something and not being able to eat anything. So I wanted to make our wedding as allergy friendly as I could.", "She doesn't want to marry because she's not interested in relationships. She said that since we'll only have around 30 guests it's not that hard to have one cake for all, even if some can not eat it. Since we offer other desserts as well, she said they could eat those instead.", "My fianc\u00e9 says he wants me to feel comfortable and our guests to all be able to have a slice of cake. The problem with the allergies is that there's also someone allergic to eggs which is a problem with gluten free cakes, as they tend to rely on the stability a beaten eggwhite offers. Of course it would be possible to make a cake taking all allergies into consideration, but it would a) not taste as good as different ones for different allergies and b) be more expensive since the bakery we will be getting our gluten free cake from would have to ensure they're not working with nuts on the day of making our cake and they'd have to deep clean their workspaces to ensure no traces of nuts to be present.", "Nah, deep fried is the way to go.", "Hilarious.", "I really enjoy that Natalie Sideserf makes all her hyper-realistic cakes using modeling chocolate -- she proves that fondant isn't necessary for fancy sculpted stuff. [Here's one.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PkCTQG3i3SA)", "This is what my husband and I did. 4 flavors of cupcakes for everyone and a small cutting cake for us. Got the joy of cutting a cake (and eating it's wonderful insides: pistachio cake layered with malted chocolate buttercream and raspberry jam) while also giving everyone options of some delicious flavors we picked. \n\nPlus I wanted the least amount of food waste at the end of the day and cupcakes helped make that possible.", "NTA\n\nThis is the way to do it... it's what my wife and I did.  We actually had one small round cake on a tiered tray with several \"fake cakes\" (that were made of Styrofoam and decorated to look identical to our real cake).  We cut the real cake for that part of the ceremony and then the whole thing was wheeled back into the kitchen.\n\nIn the kitchen we had two different, regular old sheet cakes, one chocolate and one vanilla, that were then cut up and put out for people to pick.\n\nYou could pull the same slight of hand... get a tiered cake tray and a couple Styrofoam circles to put on the lower tiers... all of that can be done super-cheaply.  Decorate the \"fake cakes\" to look like the real cake.  Do the cake cutting ceremony, have the whole thing wheeled into the back, and then have the caterer slice up and put out your other sheet cakes (with labels so people will know which are which) on the buffet.\n\nSuper simple, super cheap, and the idiots who feel they need to have a piece of some kind of magical \"wedding cake\" will be none the wiser.", "You\u2019re NTA regardless, I\u2019m not sure where you are based and what your budget is etc but if people keep on hounding you,  your local supermarket might be a good shout for the people without allergies, my local supermarket does 18 cupcakes for \u00a36 in total, buy a few decorations also from the supermarket to make them look \u201cwedding like\u201d put them on the cupcakes and it would shut people up. (Not saying you should do that but just a suggestion)", "Getting multiple separate cakes is smart, because a lot of allergies are incompatible with other restrictions. I'm tree nut and peanut allergic, so I tend to avoid both GF and vegan baked goods because of the high chance of almond flour, almond milk, or cashew milk/butter. Your cake would likely kill me \ud83d\ude09 \n\nAlso, if you're particularly attached to a formal cake cutting, you can have your cake on top of a styrofoam \"cake\" with similar decorations. You cut the actual cake, they wheel it off, and everyone gets their allergy friendly cake. It's a pretty common, but not often talked about solution for big weddings. There's a very small actual cake, and a bunch of sheet cakes in the back that actually get served. Much more budget friendly, but still gives the show.", "Ok, then in the nicest way possible, it\u2019s not her day so who gives a shit what she says? If she doesn\u2019t like it she can not eat the cakes in protest or whatever. I will say if you have that few guests you ought to look at cupcakes instead of sheet cakes because it will probably be less waste that way. Do what you want for your day.", "I've been at a wedding where there was a wedding cake and the couple asked the staff to make a slice for one of the guests because she was allergic to eggs (I don't know if there were other people with other allergies, she was sitting at my table and that's the only reason I noticed).\n\nSo you could do something similar. If I had to bet there's a couple of people with allergies, but it's not the majority by a long shot).\n\nAgain, you should do what works best for the two of you. Just trying to give alternatives that could also work.", "Why not both? Both is good!"]}
