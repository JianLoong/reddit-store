However, there's really no way for us to talk to each other with this setup. The other father, best man and my son are really the only people I'll realistically be able to talk to over the music and background noise. I would obviously prefer to sit with my wife and kids, but this is my son's big day we are talking about, so not a huge ask, really.\n\nWhen I spoke to my wife about the situation, she was furious that I would even consider it. She said she would be humiliated if I sat up there and left her at a table by herself with the kids. I told her the meal isn't that long, and we'll be together for the drinks and dancing. She refused to continue the conversation, saying I was disrespecting her by even asking.\n\nThe thing is, she can't actually stop me from sitting there if I choose to.

But really, such caution shouldn't be necessary, the two of you should be able to treat each other with the basic respect and politeness that you'd show to any adult.  \n\nAs for your current wife, what are the nature of her objections?  Does she object to you sitting close to (but not next to) your ex wife?  Does she object to sitting alone?  Will there be other people there whom she knows, and whom she could sit with?  You say she'll be sitting with the kids, plural.  How many kids do the two of you have?  How old are they?  How easy will it be for her to watch the children, on her own, in a strange place, with loud noises and lots of strangers around to make the kids nervous and restless?  Will you be able to quietly leave the main table to help her with the kids, if she should need the help, without it becoming a scene?  \n\nHaving to sit by herself, at a crowded reception, with no other adults she knows and can talk to, while herding multiple children, doesn't sound like a very pleasant experience for your wife.

I'm not actually sure what the exact seating arrangement is for the other tables.

I can't wrap my head around the logic of what you just asked.", "I suppose customs differ, where I'm from it's closest family members, or friends if no family.

Having to mind your ex's kids, with your ex right there and watching from the head table, and you not being with them, is going to be very, very awkward, particularly if your ex objects in any way to your wife's decisions about how she's handling things.  \n\nWatching kids that are yours and hers?  That should not be a problem for your wife.\n\nWatching kids that are yours and your ex's, while the two of you are both present?  Awkward, at the very least.

Though it wouldn\u2019t surprise me that in some awesome blended families a stepparent would be with the kids during a wedding if both biological parents were at the wedding party table. That\u2019s called good coparenting.", "E.g, if you had custody of the kids you had with your ex, or if your wife typically watches them during times you have visitation.\n\nIt's a thing that happens - divorced guy gets remarried, care for the kids he had from his first marriage gets left to Wife 2 when he has visitation.  There are all kinds of posts here asking about various issues with second wife having to care for first wife's kids, and peripheral issues with half siblings from the first wife, born after the divorce, etc. \n\nBut it sounds as if these are your current wife's kids, so this wouldn't be an issue in this case.", "Yes, I suppose for some people that would make sense.
