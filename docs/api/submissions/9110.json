{"id": 9110, "submission_id": "10th440", "title": "AITA for leaving my nephew\u2019s birthday party?", "selftext": "I (25f) have a sister (37f) who has 4 kids with her husband (37m), 3 sons, ages 19, 13 and 11 and a 14 y/o daughter. \n\nMy youngest nephew turned 11 last weekend and had a birthday party to celebrate. The party was held at a local arcade/restaurant, very similar to a Dave & Buster\u2019s. I got there and we were getting ready to eat first, I talked to my sister and said hi to the birthday boy, Miles. While we were sitting down and ordering food, I noticed that my 13 y/o nephew, Kason, was not there. I asked my sister about it and she said it was no big deal, which was odd to me.\n\nI went to the bathroom and called Kason to see if everything was ok, he told me he was fine and then told me why he was skipping his younger brother\u2019s party, apparently a few days ago, my sister got a call Miles and some other kids were bullying a boy at school. Apparently they were bullying the boy for being too \u201cfeminine\u201d because he does ballet, and making homophobic remarks to him. The boy is one of Kason\u2019s baseball teammates younger brother. Kason\u2019s teammates convinced him not to go to his \u201ctoxic\u201d brother\u2019s party, and Kason told me he agreed with them. I could hear Kason get pretty angry in his tone when talking about Miles\u2019s actions which is not normal for him, because it takes a lot to get him angry. \n\nAfter the phone call, I sat in the bathroom for a few minutes and was thinking to myself. Out of my 4 nieces and nephews, Kason is the only one who hasn\u2019t got in trouble for bullying before. My sister and her husband dated in high school and were also bullies, and while they\u2019re great to their kids, they often do act like the stereotype of a \u201cKaren\u201d. Miles is easily one of the worst kids I\u2019ve seen. I decided to leave early and told my sister the truth, that I spoke to Kason and thought Miles didn\u2019t deserve gifts. My gift was still in the car, so my husband and I left. I called Kason again to check on him and he asked if we could take him to the antique store my husband/his uncle owns, as the boys wanted to surprise the ballet boy who was bullied to some gifts. My husband and I took them and gave them some ballet related stuff and a few other things they\u2019d say he\u2019d like. \n\nI dropped Kason off at home, and later that day I spoke to my sister. She told me she told Kason the night before to skip the party, thinking he was bluffing and was very upset when she found out he wasn\u2019t. She was also upset I gave the boys stuff to give to Kason\u2019s friend\u2019s younger brother. It\u2019s been about a week now and Kason and Miles haven\u2019t spoken to each other. Kason is not the type of kid who stays quiet when he believes something. My sister said I\u2019m to blame for \u201cdestroying\u201d their relationship and I should\u2019ve just stayed at the party and our siblings and parents are siding with her. Kason however is texting me calling my husband and I \u201cthe best uncle and aunt ever\u201d. I\u2019m conflicted rn.

Its good to know that at least one person in your family isnt an ah (you and kason). Good for kason for standing up for the bullied kid and good for you for standing up for kason. You didnt cause a rift between brothers, shitty parenting and entitled behavior did. Keep being a support to kason cause im pretty sure hes gonna need it.\n\nEdited for spelling mistakes.", "NTA.  You said your sister/BIL were bullies.  Sounds like one of their children escaped their toxic natures.", "NTA. You are showing Kason that bullying is not appropriate and what his brother did was wrong. Miles and your sister are AHs quite frankly. Bullying should never be accepted, tolerated, or allowed. You did the right thing by supporting Kason standing up for someone.", "NTA. Thank you for setting a good example by not supporting bullies, while offering support to someone who is not afraid to stand up against them, even when it\u2019s his own family doing the bullying.", "NTA. The kids will work it out. Kason stood up for what he believed in.", "You're sister is awesome. She is punishing the one child who is an example to others?? That she takes bullying lightly is reflected in the actions of her children. You did the right thing. NTA.", "NTA. You are brilliant! I can't believe that the birthday boy still got a party, I would have hit the roof, drag his sorry a** there and made him apologize. Did Miles even get punished or do his parents agree with it? Do they understand that kids self harm, commit suicide because of bullying and how it can have possible implications for years?\n\nAny way, it makes me laugh when boys get bullied for doing ballet, let's face it ballet dancers are fit, can really move and if they like girls, they are literally surrounding by a lot of them! \n\nYou gave the birthday boy consequences. What you did is for this other boy is so kind. Miles damaged his relationship with his brother, you simply supported Karson in doing the right thing.", "NTA. You\u2019re supporting the one kid in that family speaking up against bullying.", "YTA. Yoy triangulated a relationship between minors who you're not the parents of, using your \"adult privilege,\" that is, access to money and resources, without their parents' agreement. That's highly inappropriate and regardless of your opinion of their inner family dynamics, they're not yours to meddle in.\n\nIf the boys were young adults, I wouldnt have a problem with your behavior per se, but they're *minors* and any gifts they receive and experiences they're afforded should in principle be signed off on by their parents. Kason's parents did not agree to his tour for getting ballet boy things, and they wouldn't have, cause it had clear negative implications for his relationship with his brother.\n\n Btw, I'm a lesbian and I agree bullying a kid is clearly wrong, for that reason or any other. However, in your moral convictions you need to respect other people's family boundaries and you should be VERY careful and deferential to parents messing with children's dynamics. \n\nYou did have a right to hold back the gift you got Miles cause it was your property, but that should have been used as the teaching moment and should have been the end of it.\n\nIt's not that you're wrong, exactly, it's that it's *not your place*.", "ESH.  You took the word of kason without discussion at face value. He could have been wrong or lying or upset for some other reason like being punished for some reason.  \n\nYou probably ended up not being an ah but that was pure luck.  This is how feuds in families get out of control.  People hearing one side and going way over the top with a reaction without investigating or giving the other side a chance to explain.  \n\nI am going to get slammed for this but you didn't just leave, you don't know this kid that was bullied supposedly or what happened and you are willing to completely disrespect your other nephew without even hearing his side.", "YTA.

It definitely seems like you\u2019re projecting some of your resentment about the parents onto the younger kids. I know he\u2019s your nephew, but it\u2019s kind of creepy to call him secretly and have a whole secret event with him that\u2019s deliberately going against his parents. Honestly, if I were his mom, I\u2019d feel pretty uncomfortable having you around my kids after that.", "I assume you didn\u2019t mean to type awesome\u2026 ;)", "I agree with this. Definitely overstepping as an aunt and uncle.", "Except she did talk to the sister, before leaving. If it wasn't true, that would've been the perfect moment to correct any misinformation.", "She told her sister that she didn't think the kid deserved gifts and she had talked to other kid and walked out. You don't do that in the middle of a birthday party unless you really want to humiliate someone.   \n\nI don't know.  It feels like such an overreaction based on one kids story.  \n\nMaybe the kid that was bullied was bullying first.  Maybe it was a lie.  Maybe it was true and the birthday kid is literally Satan.  But op took a side with the kid who isn't in her family based on a kids story and humiliated her nephew.  \n\nI have just seen a lot of people who overreact and judge harshly when they don't understand the situation. \n\nI know I have said things that were bullying without intentionally bullying.  My kids have been disrespectful without intending disrespect.  We need to fix these things but not by starting a family war.  It isn't aunt's job to parent nephew or to buy presents to atone for her nephew's actions.  If she wanted to fix his behavior she should have worked with him and talked to him and helped him figure out where he was wrong, not just made it easy for the kid to just say she is the rude aunt who hates him so forget what she says.", "Please keep an eye on Kason and be a safe space for him to escape to. This could so easily turn into him being a bullied scapegoat because he isn\u2019t following his parents path.", "NTA. Keep it up. You are doing everything right.

As a boy who was a competitive dancer i thank you for this. Hopefully that boy knows there are people who love and support him. Hopefully he wont let the bullies force him to stop dancing.", "YTA. You wildly overstepped. \n\nI really question if your sister is going to let you have much of a relationship with her kids after this.", "NTA", "I dropped Kason off at home, and later that day I spoke to my sister.", "I'm thinking sarcasm...", "NTA.  In fact, Kason is right.  About everything.  You are the best uncle and aunt ever.", "Oh, it\u2019s the rage baiter who is obsessed with targeting young kids. It\u2019s always the same storyline. We have the \u201csavior\u201d non-parent relative who gives consequences to the meanie bully niece/nephew (usually a younger bro or sis) who is supposedly targeting a gender fluid child, usually a boy. How many times have you posted iterations of this same storyline in the last few months? What\u2019s the deal? The last one was a child being mean to someone on Instagram (totally unrealistic that a 10 year old went on IG and found and bullied a stranger on it). I mean, I guess you made an improvement by making the bad guy an 11 year old this time. But before \u2026 it was some kid who you forced to write an essay because they were mean to the feminine athlete kid? Dude, get new material. It\u2019s really sad how you keep trying to rage bait people and trying to make young children look bad.", "NTA. You rock. \n\nKeep having your nephew\u2019s back!", "NTA your sister is a damn idiot.. you haven\u2019t wrecked anything the homophobe brother did that all in his own.

Why would the aunt punish Miles without talking to him first, even if just to help him understand why bullying is wrong?\n\nIt sounds like an anti-bullying episode of *Saved By the Bell*, especially the part about several 13 yr old boys wanting to pick out ballet-related gifts for the kid who was bullied from an antique store. Can anyone visualize this happening IRL? \n\nThat's how an adult would make a bullied kid feel better - buying him gifts. That would not be another kid's solution. Another kid's solution would be \"Let's ask him to sit with us at lunch.\" And honestly, that shows way more acceptance than any gift.\n\nI call BS.", "Yeah, it\u2019s total BS. It\u2019s also tiring to see someone work so hard to try to demonize children for no reason.", "NTA. Kason is lucky to have you two as role models.", "Hi, Ballet dancer here, NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. Not only I lost count of the number of times I was called a f-word by bullies in school before I even was 15, but I also developed a lot of self hatred and internalized homophobia when I realized I was indeed gay. I felt a lot of disgust at myself since I thought \u201cmy bullies were right all along\u201d and that to some extent I deserved their treatment and remarks. I\u2019m much better nowadays but it was a rough time coming to terms with it even with an extremely supportive family. I hope Kason keeps that level of compassion through his life and the Ballet boy is able to find peace", "NTA. Looks like Kason takes after you.

Also, believe it or not, the words 'awesome' and 'awful' were pretty much synonymous long ago. So maybe translation error.", "I think it is a reasonable assumption to make that she told her sister why Milo didn't deserve gifts, but you're right, it's not mentioned in the story. \n\n>It isn't aunt's job to parent nephew or to buy presents to atone for her nephew's actions\n\nCorrect. She didn't atone for nephew's actions, she supported her other nephew who wanted to do something nice gor the kid that was bullied. \n\n>If she wanted to fix his behavior she should have worked with him and talked to him and helped him figure out where he was wrong\n\nThat would be taking over the parent's job though. It's up to the parents to correct that behaviour. In the meantime the aunt doesn't have to support a kid who apparently bullied a someone and used homophobic slurs.", "NTA. Continue to protect Kason at all costs", "nta", "NTA!!!!", "NTA - your sister and BIL will never know what it is like to be bullied because they were - and sounds like they still are - bullies. Kason did the right thing. Bullying is not ok!", "NTA.\nGlad You are being a good role model and showing them there are consequences to their actions. Hopefully, the kids don't pick up anymore toxic behavior from their parents.", "yeah why do i see this exact same story with some details changed at least a few times a week lol. i remember another one recently where it was like the daughter and her friends were bullying a gay kid and the son and his whole football/wrestling/basketball team put a stop to it?", "\"I am in awe of just how awful she is.\" Perfectly acceptable use of awesome."]}
