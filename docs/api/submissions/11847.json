Well I didn't want to partner with anybody but after my teacher was done talking my friend asked to partner with me, now i'm not dumb and knew she just wanted to partner up and have me do basically everything and she does next to nothing. So I said no, but my friend couldn't take no for an answer and after asking a few more times she finally just sat down beside me and I had no choice but to partner with her because she had already grabbed a paper and was trying to write down plans with me for our project. Since this class we were in was art we had to make something out of cardboard and list major structures in our art , and \"we\" decided on a tiny town representing life so we had a hospital,house, graveyard, school, etc... Now I made her promise to actually work on the project since she's never given any help on the ones we've done before and she \"promised\" that she would. so, nearing the end of our project deadline she hadn't built anything while I've spent hours making houses, adding details and making sure our town looked the way it was intended to. I was the one who spent their time drawing out plans and taking measurements so that our town would look nice. and on Thursday the week before the project was due i had a choir concert. I would be spending all day doing so and wouldn't be at school that day and so I told my friend that she needed to build a building in our town or else I would be taking all the credit for the project. She called me a bitch and agreed to do it so I was happy that maybe finally she was doing something, but sadly I had to wait till Monday to see what she did because of a power outage at our school. When I came in on Monday I saw no new build and only a few pieces of cardboard that she claims was \"decor\" and she didn't even glue them on. i was so mad but i couldn't say it to her face because she was absent that day so I texted her that I would be emailing the teacher later and taking full credit for this project and she wasn't happy with that. so i had to now spend the class period making a whole new building because she couldn't. She begged and begged me through text to not get the teacher involved and to not take full credit for the project. but i didn't listen to her because i was so done with her doing this to me. After I emailed the teacher, I told her and she blocked me on our group chat. The next day the teacher pulled her outside to talk and she ended up having to make a whole new project 2 days before it was due and she didn't have the supplies like I did at home. She stopped talking to me and apparently told our friends about how much of bitch I was,and got them to take her side, and they all ended up helping her with her project too. My friends tell me I should apologize to her and that I'm in the wrong for taking full credit for the project. so, am I the a-hole  here?**", "created_utc": 1678342898, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mkt5f/aita_for_taking_full_credit_on_a_project_me_and/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You took full credit because you did the full project by yourself. It\u2019s a good life lesson for her to not  coast because she\u2019ll never get positive results by freeloading.", "NTA. You deserve credit and have integrity. \nUnfortunately, she won\u2019t learn the lesson you were hoping she would, because she is manipulative and always a victim. \nFind new friends who reciprocate your efforts, and who uplift each other.", "NTA. This should have probably happened to her long ago because I bet she's prone to being the group project dead weight. You may have even saved future people some aggravation because maybe she'll learn this painful lesson for the future.", " You indicated from the beginning that you wanted to do the project alone. She did not respect that. She clearly set out to take advantage of you. Do your friends know the whole story? Or just her version of it? If they know the whole story and still see nothing wrong with that but expect you to apologise for standing up for yourself, then they are clearly no friends of yours. And they care more about her feelings than yours. Which makes them just as bad. Get new and better friends. \n\nNTA in any shape or form.", "I'm not going to rate this as this is just eye-bleeding to read.", "NTA and you can be sure those friends didn't got the truth from her.", "NTA. You took full credit because you did it. Hopefully she will no longer push herself onto you in this way again. The friends who helped her can look forward to doing her work in future.", "NTA. She's only got ideas, no actual follow-through. She doesn't get credit for that.", "NTA. You did it all, so you deserve full credit. Your friends are just enabling bad behavior on her part that won\u2019t fly when she gets a job. None of them will think it\u2019s okay if they have a co-worker like this who is literally earning money for their work.", "NTA\n\nShe probably told a made up story to your shared friends that she also contributed to the project.\n\nIf she keeps repeating the same thing (not putting in work for projects) and nobody ever confronts her with the consequences, she wil keep doing this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are probably the first one who confronted her.", "NTA. She mistook you for a doormat at that tiny building in that tiny town. Good for you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA, hopefully not likely this will teach her a lesson and your other so called friends will soon realise what's she like when they have to partner up with her.", "my friends did know the whole story and even though i've told them my side a bunch of times they still choose to support her instead of me. i definitely need new friends...", "This is the comment I was looking for. Reading all that was a trip. Now I feel like the text on my phone is too skinny to be real.", "Yeah op, you need new friends. NTA", "NTA.\nYou did the work therefore you get the credit. When I was in school, I hated when \u201cfriends\u201d did this. If there was a valid reason (being in the hospital, family emergency), I would\u2019ve let it slide. But she was just being lazy and entitled. She felt she deserved this and you showed her that she needed to actually earn her grade. You asked for a very small amount of work and she still refused to do it. You did the right thing. To be honest, if I was feeling extra salty, I\u2019d let the teacher know that she didn\u2019t even complete her own project, that her friends did the work for her.", "NTA, you did the full project so you get full credit.", "NTA Why should someone like your \"friend\" get credit for something they didn't do? Next time move away from this person or someone like her and do it yourself.", "Arguably she didn\u2019t learn anything because she still had her flying monkeys help her and tell OP to apologise and that they were wrong. What\u2019s she gonna learn when everyone thinks OP was wrong? OP should stick to their guns and next time tell the teacher earlier that she didn\u2019t contribute, but they\u2019re NTA for anything.", "NTA. I\u2019d find a new friend group.", "How dare you take full credit for the work only you did.", "I was pretty tempted to reply \u201cYTA for typing your entire post in bold.\u201d but that\u2019s not really fair to the question being asked\u2026so I did it anyway, but by my understanding the judgement bot won\u2019t see it here in a sub-reply.", "NTA", "Totally NTA.
