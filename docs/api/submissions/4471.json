My mom lost all custody of me in court for reasons I won't get into so after that I was raised by my dad. I'm NC with my mom and I intend to keep it that way.\n\nWhen I was 16, my dad (M40s) met a woman online and got married and moved her in after only knowing her for a few weeks. For the sake of this story we'll call her June (F60s).\n\nI want to make it clear that I don't dislike June. She was always very nice to me when I was living there and did typical 'mom' things, she'd help me with my homework, helped me learn how to drive, etc, etc. We had a few conflicts here and there but it was all petty stuff.\n\nNow, the issue is that June keeps referring to herself as my baby's grandma, both on social media and to everyone in the family.\n\nI talked to June and told her that although she's part of the family and a wonderful woman, she is not my mom and not my baby's grandma. June told me she feels betrayed. She started screaming at me and accused me of pushing her out of the family and my baby's life, and said that I'm being heartless and cold.\n\nMy husband made her leave and that was that. My dad is now really angry at me and told me I owe June a huge apology and that I'm causing rifts for no reason. He said with everything June has done for me the least I can do is let her have the grandma title.", "created_utc": 1670764168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zirb4y/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_that_shes_not_my/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She loved you and cared for you when your father married her and from the tone of your post, it appears the two of you have had a good relationship. She sounds genuinely excited and proud to have a new baby in the family. I feel like there's more to this than what you included in the post. What bothers you so much about her wanting to be called grandma?", "INFO: if she's been in your life that long and you \"don't dislike\" her, what is the problem with her being your baby's grandma? Is it just because she's not blood related to you?", "ESH - her reaction was not ok, but why isn\u2019t she allowed to be a grandma? That woman is going to love your child so much. \n\nBoth my grandparents are divorced so I have 4 grandmothers and 4 grandfathers while only half of them is by blood. They all loved me very much and as a kid I was blessed with so much love. \nI never called them any other thing then grandma or grandpa.", "You are entitled to how to feel, but she was a mother figure to you and she was nice to you.  Your baby deserves all the love they can get and she wants to give your baby the love of a grandma.  Your kid will not care about the family tree, only that they feel loved.  Why not allow her that honorary title?\n\nSoft YTA", "YTA-it sounds like June has done nothing \u201cwrong\u201d other than this.  I think your response has more to do with your NC with your real mom. Teaching someone to drive and helping with homework and just generally caring for a child takes emotional investment. She was happy for you and ready to be a supportive presence for your child.  I think you owe her an apology.", "INFO: What difference does it make if your kid has a bonus grandma?  You gave zero reasons why this is a big deal to you.  From what you posted, you are absolutely TA, but it seems like there is a lot of missing info here.", "YTA\n\nWhy in the world would you want to deprive your child of a grandmother for apparently no reason.\n\nThere was nothing in your relationship with her after she married your father that wasn't perfectly appropriate and kind. \n\nI think you are still dealing with whatever issues you have regarding your bio mother. For a biological mother to lose custody of her children and for the child to then go NC as an adult means there are some very serious dysfunctional issues which probably you haven't fully resolved.\n\nEven if you were too old to think of her as your mother, your child is not to old to have a warm grandmotherly relationship with June.\n\nPeople have all kinds of extremely loving relationships with people who aren't their blood relatives - again your daughter has no maternal grandmother except June - why would you want to prevent your daughter from having this kind of wonderful bond? Most children have the absolute best memories of their grandparents and there is nothing to indicate that June wouldn't have been an absolutely fabulous grandmother for your child even if she wasn't biologically related.", "ESH. Her for screaming and yelling. You for being petty and alienating two people from your baby who could have given them love and support", "YTA\n\nBoth of my grandfathers are not biologically my grandfathers (both of my bio grandfathers were not in my parent's lives).\n\nI grew up seeing them as my grandfathers and felt happy having those connections.\n\nA child does not care if they are blood-related,they just care that this person is loving and shows up for them.\n\nI think it's really weird for you to want your child to not form that special bond and attachment with someone just because they are not blood-related. Seems like you are taking your personal trauma and projecting it onto your child's life.", "YTA \n\nWhat was the goal in doing so? Agreed to 'mother' as she entered your life pretty late, but gma role? Did she overstep or turned ohnoxious acting out her honorary gma role? I think no, otherwise you would have mentioned it. You were even complimentary about her, despite how they got initially got together (which you disapproved of). \n\nYour kid would only be luckier to be surrounded by truly loving people, blood-related or honorary family. Don't burn bridges that supported you in the past and could still enrich your family in the future, out of gratitude, basic respect and/or common sense.", "YTA although I agree that June\u2019s reaction was overboard. You should ask yourself what is best for your kid. Kids can have grandparent figures in their lives who are not biologically related to them. They can have bio grandparents who are mean to them or are not in their lives at all. What counts is the relationship between them & the kid, & you are doing your child no favors by alienating her bio grandfather & his wife.", "INFO, what is the reason you don\u2019t want her to be considered a grandma?\n\nAt this point, ESH. She\u2019s technically the step grandmother. It\u2019s not wrong for her to assume she would be a grandma. Sounds like she stepped into the role of stepmother and was good to you, and would probably be good to your child too. Consider that your child may one day want her to be grandma. Maybe your issues with your own mother are affecting your feelings toward her. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way. She was likely very hurt, but screaming like that is not ok.", "YTA. This woman who, by your own description, has been good to you and part of your life for a significant amount of time.

I\u2019m auntie to a bunch of kids that aren\u2019t actually related to me.

She shouldn\u2019t have screamed at you, but it sounds like you want to be petty, and alienate her for no reason, other than you wanting full control of what your kid calls people, which won\u2019t happen anyways. I agree that it comes off as very cold, especially to a woman you claim to like. \n\nYTA", "Idk if you're really an AH for this. You don't see her as your mother. That's okay. However, a grandparent role and a parent role are two different things. My dad's wife isn't my mom. I don't see her as my mom, but my future kids will already be missing a grandparent and I know my dad's wife will love my kids just as much as my mom would have. While she doesn't have the title of mom in my life she will absolutely have the title of grandma. People who will love your child as a grandparent should are a blessing.", "YTA. It's not like she's stealing the title from your mom, you're NC. And what were you planning to do in a few years when your kid calls them grandpa and grandma instead of grandpa and June?\n\nHonorary family titles are very common, though more in often it's family friends called aunt or uncle.", "Not your mom?  Maybe not by blood, maybe you don't call her that, but she did come into your life and give you a home. She did indeed have part in raising you doing \"mom stuff\" as you said. Unless there is something being left out there is absolutely no reason for her not to be proud of the woman she watched grow up and her new baby she is grandma!  If my stepdaughter did this to me I would be devastated. The poor woman.  Nothing like making someone feel they are unwanted just because they love and care for you.\nYTA x50", "YTA. I can totally understand why a loving woman who, outside of this, never did anything wrong, was a supportive mother figure to you, should be denied being called grandma. How dare she want to love and be a part of your child, and yourself. What a narcissist she is to think you love her too. Your real mom who probably abused you should absolutely be grandma. After all, blood and DNA are what matter, right?", "Your poor baby doesn\u2019t get a grandma.

Including that bit is just an attempt to put her down and adds no value to the situation.\n\nYour stance is all about you and your hang ups.", "NTA.\n\nJune assuming that she is 'grandma' is rather entitled and bold.  If you and your partner aren't comfortable with that, then she has to respect that decision.  Her reaction to begin screaming at you and claiming that you are pushing her out of the baby's life is ridiculously dramatic and self-centered.  Just because she doesn't have a 'grandmother' title doesn't mean she can't have a relationship with the baby (unless you don't want her to, which is also your call).\n\nGiven the tantrum from June, I feel like you made a great decision.

She's trying to define herself as your mother; can't be a GM without being a mother.  She's overstepping and feeling very entitled, based on the explosive reaction.  She can be a loving figure in the baby's life without needing a problematic title requiring third-party approval (OP's)", "ESH - her reaction was not wonderful and it wasn\u2019t quite okay for her to make the assumption, but the reality is that if your dad is grandpa to your baby, inevitably your child will view June as a grandmotherly figure even if June isn\u2019t called grandma because unlike you, the child won\u2019t have a frame of reference where June didn\u2019t exist in their life. \n\nGuess what? It\u2019s okay if they aren\u2019t blood related and still call them grandma because it\u2019s not about the name, it\u2019s about the time spent together, birthdays, holidays, wisdom passed down, picking each other up during the hard stuff.", "ESH.\n\nShe is indeed not entitled to any title you don't want to grant her for yourself.\n\nThis child will grow up seing her as her grandmother, whether you want it or not.

But you need to fix this.\n\nHer actions towards your baby, and you, seem to be kind and motherly/grandmotherly.\n\nSuggestion:  Agree on a different moniker.  Nana or Meemaw or something you and she make up together.  I know a lady named Catherine and her stepgrandchildren call her GrandCat.  I know another elderly lady who was called Sister when she was a kid, (one girl and four boys in her family), then her nieces and nephews called her Aunt Sister, then her grandchildren called her Grandma Aunt Sister, which got too confusing and now everybody calls her Aunt Sister even though she isn't their aunt or their sister.\n\nThe title  doesn't matter so much as the caring, right?\n\nMaybe sit down quietly with her and say Sorry.

It is just more people to love and be there for your kid. You not wanting that with your stepmom sounds like an issue that you have with her not being your mom, and not about her not loving and caring for you and your child. If you don't have any step or half siblings, then this is the only way she gets to be a grandparent of any sort, so while she shouldn't have gotten so angry, I can understand why she did. \n\nYou should think through why you have an issue with her being grandma, and then explain your feelings to her.

You started something from nothing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

My mom lost all custody of me in court for reasons I won't get into so after that I was raised by my dad. I'm NC with my mom and I intend to keep it that way.\n\nWhen I was 16, my dad (M40s) met a woman online and got married and moved her in after only knowing her for a few weeks. For the sake of this story we'll call her June (F60s).\n\nI want to make it clear that I don't dislike June. She was always very nice to me when I was living there and did typical 'mom' things, she'd help me with my homework, helped me learn how to drive, etc, etc. We had a few conflicts here and there but it was all petty stuff.\n\nNow, the issue is that June keeps referring to herself as my baby's grandma, both on social media and to everyone in the family.\n\nI talked to June and told her that although she's part of the family and a wonderful woman, she is not my mom and not my baby's grandma. June told me she feels betrayed. She started screaming at me and accused me of pushing her out of the family and my baby's life, and said that I'm being heartless and cold.\n\nMy husband made her leave and that was that. My dad is now really angry at me and told me I owe June a huge apology and that I'm causing rifts for no reason. He said with everything June has done for me the least I can do is let her have the grandma title.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH. I suppose your step mom was being a little presumptive by not calling herself step grandma, but that's not really a term in the vernacular.  As far as your actions, what were you hoping to accomplish, other than cause harm?  Were you afraid your family would forget this woman didn't give birth to you, if she didn't call herself step grandma? Is your family full of morons?", "I am gonna jump in here and also say: \"lost opportunity\" having lost my grandparents kind of early and knowing friends that have no grandparents, grandparents are really truly a gift.  If June wants to give herself and her time to your child, consider yourself blessed.  You know how many kids score Thier first basketball hoop and no one sees it because Thier parents are at work?  It's a lot.  You don't have to apologize but I would really consider engaging with June in an adult way, and if you can't handle the world grandma, call her Nani or Oma and let her and your child develope something special...", "You don\u2019t just get to declare yourself as someone\u2019s parent if that\u2019s not how they feel. \n\nNone of that stuff makes her OP\u2019s mom. She only entered OP\u2019s life when she was 16, helping someone with their homework for 2 years doesn\u2019t make you a parent. \n\nIf it did, I would have a bunch of children my own age from when I tutored in high school and college. \n\nBeing a good stepparent does not make you their actual parent.", "Agreeing with this. I think it's the baby's choice on who is or isn't called granny when they're old enough to decide. Just as OP has the right to not see June as a mother figure, the baby has a right to see her as a grandmother. You can't make those decisions for your kids, in either direction", "Obviously OP made the right decision based on June\u2019s unhinged reaction.", "This is the question and OP needs to think hard about how her NC rule toward her bio mother is impacting her relationship(s) with other women in her family and her view of herself as a mother.  Is she teaching her child to stay distant from others? Edit: and by this I mean she has every right to keep her bio mother away if she is abusive but we can\u2019t build walls against everyone.", "OP did not indicate that her partner has no parents.", "Might have conned her kid right out of a college fund \u2639\ufe0f", "Agreed! \nNta\n\nAlso, June came into op's life at 16, so probably op view June like her father partner instead of a mother figure", "All of this \u2b06\ufe0f", "Feels like this is the straw that broke the camel's back. OP doesn't think highly of stepmom due to how she and her dad got together. OP probably didn't hide it, or didn't hide it as well she thinks she did all those years, despite the woman's best efforts to fill stepmom duties.", "But OP didn't say that June was referring to herself as OP's parent/mother, just as the child's grandmother.  The terms \"mother\" and \"father\" have very strong emotions attached to them that I don't think \"grandmother\" does.  June has been involved since the child was born and seems to have been in the role of grandmother while the \"biological grandmother\" hasn't been.  \n\n\nTo me, the child benefits by having a loving grandmother - even if that grandmother doesn't happen to share DNS.", "You gotta stay consistent. If you don't see someone as a parent figure then don't accept their attempts to be one. You can't benefit from someone and then say you don't see them that way. Why should June have put in all that effort for OP when OP wasn't interested?", "Sure but there is a middle ground between full acceptance and total rejection.  I think this requires more discussion than just rejecting her outright.  She doesn't seem to have any issues with June other than this.", "Should June have yelled and screamed?  Certainly not, but she is human and likely reacting out of hurt, anger, and perhaps shock.  It certainly doesn't sound like this is typical behavior from her.", "Take it with a grain of salt. I think she was crying. I have to yell when I cry or no sound comes out.", "Agreed.\n\nOP even refers to June as her father's wife so I don't understand why everyone keeps calling June her stepmom lol.  There's a fundamental difference.", "Not at all, you're jumping into conclusions regardless of the only evidence we have\n\n>I want to make it clear that I don't dislike June. She was always very nice to me when I was living there and did typical 'mom' things, she'd help me with my homework, helped me learn how to drive, etc, etc. We had a few conflicts here and there but it was all petty stuff.", ">But OP didn't say that June was referring to herself as OP's parent/mother, just as the child's grandmother.\n\nCan't be a GM without being a mother.  She overstepped and believes she's entitled to define her relationship with someone else; she can only define their relationship to *her.*", "Exactly, I don't get it either, op has been cordial to June but she doesn't owe any family title to June", ">met a woman online and got married and moved her in after only knowing her for a few weeks\n\nA curious description to include in characterizng a stepmom who treated her well for many years.", "Maybe you think you can't be a grandmother without being a mother, but for. me it has more to do with love than biology.", "Curious? Why curious? Is there something wrong? Just stating facts if it happened that way.", "I don't find it curious. I found it logical. They rushed things and imposed their relationship onto the teenager.", "Love whomever you like but it doesn't automatically entitle you to a specific title, especially one that depends on someone else.  Titles carry expectations, sometimes even rights, which the SM is trying to claim unasked.", "Yes because all grown ups make decisions based on the teenager lol", "Lol- June would never have rights to the baby. My god.", "GP rights are a thing in certain areas, plus it can create unwarranted social expectations when OP's dad is no longer in the picture.\n\nSM can love the baby just the same, with or without a title.", "Ya not as a step parent or step grand parent lol. Might want to delete that one. Lol you are insinuating that OP will be abusive to the baby and be removed \ud83d\ude44", "I see no implication or reason for inference.  Caffeine hasn't kicked in, so humor me."]}
