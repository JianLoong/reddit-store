My daughter just turned one and my husband and I have had plenty of such \"discussions\". My issue is that my daughter wants only me when she wakes up. She will thrash around if her father picks her up. So even he gets up to go to her, more often than not, after some time I have to go in and take over.", "NTA, but your daughter sure is the AH.

You might want to look into hiring an overnight nanny for at least one night a week so that both of you can get some quality sleep for once in a while.", "Look. Are you \"in the wrong\" here? Sure. But there's no possible judgment here except NAH, and I'll tell you why.\n\nMost of my family has gone through medical school, and as I've watched them do it, I've noticed something: Third Year of medical school is pretty much useless, except to teach one thing (and one thing only) the only way it can be taught: Be gentle with people, because anyone--including you--can be tortured until they would be tempted to let someone who trusted them die for an hour of sleep. People you see at their worst aren't necessarily that way by choice, and fatigue is a surefire way to start chipping away at people's inhibitions.\n\nThere's no way that the \"you\" that made that decision is the real \"you.\" Nor is the version of your husband who made that snide remark the real \"him.\" Your husband is right that the standard you're applying to yourself is more lax than the one he's applying to himself. This week, he's pulling more than his weight and picking up your slack. There will be weeks where it's the other way around, I guarantee it. Tell him he's right, and that you're sorry he lost that sleep, but you really love him and his willingness to get up and handle the situation makes you feel loved and cherished, and that you appreciate it.\n\nHe doesn't want a pound of flesh. He doesn't want you to pay for the hour of sleep you took from him. He wants you to wrap your arms around him, rest your head on his chest, and say, \"My hero! Thank you for taking such good care of our family.\"\n\nNo assholes here.

However, you used it because you were merely a little annoyed because you had just laid back down.  \n\nYour husband isn't wrong - You woke him up and made him get out of bed simply because you didn't want to get out of bed, not because you were at the end of your rope.", "NAH\n\nRaising a baby is hard work. He's tired, you're tired, things get said that people don't mean. Yeah, you could have been up easier then him. Note that and stick with the system for next time.", "NAH:\n\nAfter a night of dealing with a grumpy baby your husband wants to talk calmly and rationally? If you responded in kind y'all are killing the parenting thing.\n\nThis isn't a big situation. Use those incredible communication skills to work through this. Worse is yet to come and you'll need to continue to be a team.", "NTA\n\nIt's not up to him when you decide you need to bring in backup. I can understand him wanting a conversation if it was happening all the time, but you did it once, and it wasn't after 5min. Sometimes we have to lean on our partners more and it's our partner's job to take that bit of weight for a while.", "These comments have shown me that women are terrified to lose their husbands over demanding for help when they\u2019re too tired to continue themselves. I\u2019ll just see my way out lolol.", "NAH - I don't think you're an AH but I would have been annoyed too and can understand his frustration.  My wife and I had the exact same arrangement (we alternated \"night shifts).  I never once \"tapped out\" even though that meant at times literally getting 2-3 hours of sleep but sometimes she would and I was always annoyed.", "NAH. You\u2019re tired cranky parents. You are and will continue to talk through it. There\u2019s no situation here.", "No asshole.\n\nIt's a marathon and it's a relay race. You gotta trade off and you gotta keep going for a looooong time. For your strategy of tapping out to work, neither of you should be willing to tap out until you are at your wits end, both of you need to trust that when the other person taps out it's because they are exhausted and need a break, and both of you need to be understanding about slip-ups by the other one.\n\nIt's natural that dad was snippy and grumpy, it's natural that you were tired and needed to tap out, and it's natural for the baby to cry. No assholes here.", "I mean your wrong in the situation but I can really call you an asshole for it so NAH just stick to the agreement for now on.", "YTA\n\nThere is an arrangement in place. You broke it. He's allowed to make a comment about it.", "Based on the agreed upon system you described, then YTA.", "First of all, it isn\u2019t a competition of who has to deal with the baby fussing longer. I know it is tense because you are both sleep deprived. Second, maybe just get a baby monitor and a camera installed to look in on baby, and unless something is wrong, just stay in bed. It may help the baby to not be so dependent on you guys to come running the moment she cries for no reason in the middle of the night. Also to be fair, you carried her 9 months, got tore up from birthing (vaginal or cesarian both suck and take time to heal), and if you had to breast feed, that isn\u2019t easy either. He can suck it up and let you sleep more from time to time, it won\u2019t kill him. You already sacrificed a lot of sleep and energy during your pregnancy and delivery. Just pass him your big girl panties and tell him to suit up \ud83d\ude02", "NAH/a soft NTA. sounds like a pretty solid system to me, and you both were dealing with a fair amount of annoyance. I do think if it was enough of an issue that he felt the need to be snarky and to comment/initiate discussion about it then he could/should have told you no when you asked him to get up. you should have room for some negotiation; no system will be perfect. wishing you a few nights of peace at least!", "NTA\n\nBut really neither is your husband. Sleep deprivation is tough (speaking as someone who had a tricky toddler who wouldn't settle without a fight) and when you're exhausted you're naturally going to have a point of view which is biased towards you getting more sleep. It sounds like you're both trying to share the burden fairly but you're exhausted and there's a grey area. If this becomes a recurrant argument come up with a more concrete plan. In the mean time try to both go to bed a bit earlier and give each other the benefit of the doubt.", "YTA. It sounds like you know this wasn\u2019t what you and your husband agreed on.", "Raising newborns is NOT easy. They\u2019re up at whatever hours, they can\u2019t communicate effectively what they want or need, and obviously they can\u2019t do anything for themselves.. and this is why the overnight snuggles, feedings, and diaper changes need to be shared. I understand how your tap out system is supposed to work, but like just happened to you, it can sometimes be wanted out of annoyance at just getting to lay back down. This is going to be a common happening for a long time, so you might want to reevaluate and discuss something slightly altered. NAH - just tired newborn parents.", "NTA\n\nIt was all fine when he needed help.", "NTA, it's all very well and good having a plan but you can account for all possibilities - there shouldn't be time limit on tapping out if you're struggling. Sometimes you can handle 3 hours of soothing and soemtimes you can barely handle 1. \n\nHe doesn't get to decide what is difficult for you to deal with in a specific situation", "NTA. You've helped him on his night, now he helps you on your night. Sounds fair.", "What are you doing to fix your 18 month old's sleep habits? Why is an 18 month old consistently awake for hours at a time? Well, we don't all have angel toddlers, it really sounds like you are not addressing the root of the problem.", "YTA strictly  for not sticking to your agreement.\n\n\nSpeaking from experience though, I'd advise not worrying about who's at fault in situations like this. Your child is going to continue to test you and your husband in more and more extreme ways. You guys need to be a united front.  Don't dwell on things like this too much, both of you will react poorly to situations based on being exhausted(physically and emotionally), so give him the same leniency you'd hope to receive", "Nta. Just bc he didn't tap out when he should have the first time doesn't mean you have to do it for longer to make some kind of fair game.", "NTA, buy as others noted it can be hard to feel balanced during this period. I'm glad he was so calm about it. I'm not saying because you're NTA that he is, just to be clear. Nobody is, here.", "ESH having kids aren't easy, I don't get the whole split time thing as it takes 2 to make and it should take 2 to work on without sniping at eachother...", "YTA - you waited two hours to relieve your husband, why do you think it\u2019s fair he relieves you after one?", "[deleted]", "YTA. One hour wasn't long enough. \n\nPlus, stop trying to get sympathy from reddit when your husband and you are both irritable.
