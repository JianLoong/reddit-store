But there's no possible judgment here except NAH, and I'll tell you why.\n\nMost of my family has gone through medical school, and as I've watched them do it, I've noticed something: Third Year of medical school is pretty much useless, except to teach one thing (and one thing only) the only way it can be taught: Be gentle with people, because anyone--including you--can be tortured until they would be tempted to let someone who trusted them die for an hour of sleep. People you see at their worst aren't necessarily that way by choice, and fatigue is a surefire way to start chipping away at people's inhibitions.\n\nThere's no way that the \"you\" that made that decision is the real \"you.\" Nor is the version of your husband who made that snide remark the real \"him.\" Your husband is right that the standard you're applying to yourself is more lax than the one he's applying to himself. This week, he's pulling more than his weight and picking up your slack. There will be weeks where it's the other way around, I guarantee it.

I understand how your tap out system is supposed to work, but like just happened to you, it can sometimes be wanted out of annoyance at just getting to lay back down.

You might want to see if there\u2019s an issue or if perhaps she is napping too much during the day. I don\u2019t know how y\u2019all are doing this for so long. You must be exhausted!\n\nNAH. Toddlers are difficult!", "Just want to recommend that shifts are much better than alternate turns. \n\nSwitch so that one of you takes the 10pm - 2am and one takes 2 am - 6 am, or whatever schedule works for you. If she tends to wake up at the same time each night, alternate shifts every day or every few days. This way, each of you gets a minimum of 4 hours' uninterrupted sleep and you don't have to both wake up each time to figure out whose turn it is", "NTA, the only actual AH here is the baby. Not getting sleep sucks, you and your husband are both suffering. You both need to remember that and be kind to each other during this.\n\n(PS I am sure the baby is also a precious sweet gift. And an AH. They can be both :-))", "NAH and all the comments of people saying YTA because of the agreed upon system you set up likely don\u2019t have kids and have never had to deal with the sleepless nights of a toddler going though teething or a stomach flu or a sleep regression. Your level of exhausting is subjective and can\u2019t be measured by time. You\u2019re trying. Your husband is trying. In the middle of the night when you aren\u2019t sleeping neither of you are in your right minds. Keep up the communication. There will be nights where his capacity to wake up with the toddler gets reached quicker than usual and he\u2019ll ask you to step in. It\u2019s a give and take, don\u2019t keep score.", "As mum to an 8 week old, this response made me cry\u2026 we\u2019re getting some sleep these days but it\u2019s never guaranteed and going without is a special kind of torture.", "the real LPT is in the comments (of AITA)", "We have lemon laws in the US....take her back to the hospital and ask for a new one!", "There is an arrangement in place. You broke it. He's allowed to make a comment about it.", "Haha that is a true reddit answer!", "I don't get why an hour plus is somehow not enough? Maybe OP had a bad day and needed extra rest/couldn't mentally deal with it. They have a deal they can tap out and ask for help when they need a break/help. If the father wants to put in hard rules re when that's allowed I think that's kind of shitty. Sometimes you just can't deal with it and need your partner to be a partner and support you. OP NTA", "18 months is a newborn now?", "Lol no thank god. She sleeps through most of the time (like 18/20 nights) but she\u2019s popping teeth and in daycare so you know how it goes", "[removed]", "Lol my mom always told me \u201cit\u2019s not too late for me to bring you back to the hospital and trade you for a new one\u201d. It was all in good fun when I was being extra sassy.", "Lol my dad always said once the aardvark salesman came by he'd trade us in! I actually bought him a stuffed one for Christmas several years ago and he pretended outrage that the salesman had come by and we didn't tell him!\n\nI need to get a new one, that one disappeared in a move.", "He broke it too? The arrangement is that they can tap out and ask for help to keep each other sane. She didn't do anything that didn't follow that guideline. If you're in a place where you're frustrated w the baby, it's better to ask for help from your spouse than to let it fester", "NAH. NTA judgement implies that husband is somehow the asshole, which is just a bad judgement call.", "I thought the above was an obvious /s! I laughed but then realized they were serious lol!! Mental.", "No, that's what u/purplewoodcarver thinks. \n\nYou don't think anything, because you're a bot, u/enough_educator3956", "I still threaten to sell mine to the gypsies and the youngest is 17", "My husband isn't good with waking up and being patient during his work week.", "My daughter popped out 14 teeth and started daycare (and therefore the cycle of illnesses) in the last 10 months. That\u2019s why the system exists LOL", "I mean, I'd assume the elaborate system started when the kid was first born?", "No, that's the husband of u/Doenut55\n\nBots don't have husbands. Silly u/charafgh", "That info wasn't shared until after I commented."]}
