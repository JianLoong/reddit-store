I\u2019m sure a court would agree with dad.", "when me and my best friend were kids.\n\nHer mother would put us in the bathtub together nothing wierd about it.\n\nJust 2 kids having fun with bubbles in a bathtub \n\nKids don't see it as wierd or nasty. \n\nI still don't tbh.", "You should be able to wash your own hair by the time youre 7.", "you're a weirdo my G... And now you're trying to use cultural misunderstandings to create doubt", "Absolutely not.", "Even if they did (they shouldn't), that doesn't require getting fully naked in the shower with them.", "Cardi B and lady Gaga are uptight? Our culture isn't uptight we just have a good grasp on what's appropriate and what isn't.", "A school fired the principal because she showed students a picture of Michelangelo\u2019s David. Parents called it pornographic. \n\nBut sure, our society on the whole is not uptight.", "It\u2019s true\u2026 As a generality, we\u2019re known to be a little puritanical as a culture when it comes to nudity.", "What? I've helped many young ones in our family with their hair and I was NOT in the shower with them.  You are making an assumption that is likely not accurate.", "Lol yeah wtf!?", "American here.  I very clearly remember doing homework in kindergarten 25ish years ago.  I can literally close my eyes and see the exact types of homework it was.", "The difference here is thats your culture and if thats normal there, than alright. But in america thats not the norm.\n\nEdit - *in most cultures in america", "You had lots of showers with the mom's boyfriend when you were 7yo?", "If op was naked would that make it weird?", "Yeah, but this is not 2 kids (and I can relate as my mum and my best friends mum used to bathe us together all the time when we were children). This is an adult non related male (even if he is the mothers husband of 4 years) and a 7 year old child.", "Many 7 year olds struggle to rinse the shampoo", "Nudity =/= sex\n\nIt seems we exported all our puritans to you", "We\u2019re not uptight about guns, that\u2019s for sure! /s", "> His dad said thanks but he still needs to wash and condition Randy's hair.\n\nHow is the dad doing that if the kid showers on his own?", "I get it but I guess it\u2019s still depends on the household in America. I was born and raised in US but I have lived in different country when I was young so I guess I have several outlook on thing. It seems like that dude is diff culture too and maybe his wife or family? I guess more info probably better on this one. I will agree though if the bio dad isn\u2019t comfortable, he really shouldn\u2019t do it again and respect that. No argument there.", "Whaaat? Dude, you realized that we are talking about gender equivalent sharing a shower right? Weirdo. That guy was talking about he and his son while I (F) talk about shower with my mom (F). Didn\u2019t think I need to spell this out.", "There are plenty of naked men in the showers.", "[deleted]", "I still fail to see how that makes me \u201cuptight\u201d but okay.", "They don\u2019t.", "@jrim1002 m1002 just curious here if this would still be the case today? Because I was thinking yes it depends on culture but I also think generation. Where I'm from, kids used to sit naked in little bath tubs in their garden, now a days that absolutely would not be OK. Times have changed what's acceptable and not acceptable.", "Exactly.  The guy is saying its cool cos he's asian and showered with his family.  I'm asking whether this acceptable behavior extends to other men, perhaps your mom's male friends?  OP is not the kid's father, just essentially a BF of the mother.", "It was done at a community showers. It sound like it was in your home.", "No. There is just no need for a 7 year old child to be showering with any adult who is not their parent.", "I\u2019m not who you asked but even if it was bio mum or bio dad I would find it weird they showered with a 7 y/o", "It's not something I can explain to you.  Your feelings about this situation make you uptight.  Presumably your upbringing and cultural conditioning.  People can be naked without it being bad.  God isn't real.  Not everything is about sex.", "I think you have a point there. I never really thought about it but it really has become more a no no with the new generation. This not to say if that\u2019s better or worst. I think it\u2019s just how it had evolved.", "I guess I understood as him being a second dad since he raised him up so it seems less weird to me. But again I think the dynamic and circumstances would depends on their family. A typical American household, absolutely no. A non typical American with cultural influences, depending on family dynamic BUT again, he mentioned the bio dad being uncomfortable so I would say no, don\u2019t do it again. Bio dad overrule especially since he\u2019s active in the child life.", "[deleted]", "Why? Do you see it as something sexuel?", "So if youre going to insult me, I would hope you could at least elaborate. \n\nBUT i said nothing about nudity and/or sex. I said a 7 year old should be capable of showering by themselves. Thats all.", "I think it's better in the sense we're now more aware of how to safeguard and protect our children, but bad that we have become this way through a history of children being exploited in various ways. It's always been about I think, we're just more aware of it now. It's the same with like rape culture for lack of better term. My old lecturer worked alongside Jimmy Savile and said the women didn't report harassment and inappropriateness because they didn't think they could or believe anyone would take it serious. It was just accepted back then as the norm. Crazy to us now. It's a scary world out there and we need to know what to watch out for, but we can't let it control our lives either.", "Why would your friends son even ask that?\n\nConversely, if the father indicated that he was not happy with it, would you still do it?", "Not inherently, no. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason for an adult to be naked and showering with a child. Especially a child who is old enough to shower independently. \n\nMaybe my past colours my opinion, since I was groomed and abused as a child.", "You said yourself that Americans are uptight.  I was agreeing with you."]}
