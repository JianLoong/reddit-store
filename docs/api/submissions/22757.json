If the kid is not your kid, then you need to defer to said kid\u2019s parents no matter your relationship with the child. This wasn\u2019t up to OP to decide.

They still sometimes came and chatted with us while we showered, or asked us to hang out, but we didn't need to be in the shower with them for any of that. \n\nI generally don't have an issue with nudity of others - I prefer my privacy and to not be nude - but I'm also well aware of the risk factor non-related adults present to children. And that you don't need to be naked in the small cramped space with the child to wash their hair etc. The physical space is rarely large enough to be comfortable fitting multiple people, it's not built for communal showering. There's only so many times you accidentally knock your toddler into the glass with your bare arse as you turn before it is just far more uncomfortable and inefficient to shower together for the most part. That's why I'd be uncomfortable - there are many ways to do this that don't require an adult to be naked and in close contact with my child, and I don't like what makes it the better choice than being outside in clothes, or even in your jocks.", "Is it normal there to shower with a child who is not biologically yours? I\u2019m not trying to be mean. I\u2019m genuinely curious. In my Asian American family, 7 years old is too old to shower with an adult who is not your biological mother especially if it is a boy.

For some context, that is [approximately](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/percentage-of-redheads-by-country) the percentage of Ireland that is redheaded. You are about as likely to encounter a child that has been abused in the US as you are to meet someone who is redheaded in Ireland.
