Doesn\u2019t seem like the child cared or there was some weird power dynamic to get him to do it (hence why he asked if he said something bc OP cares if the child was upset by it) also I don\u2019t really care if the dad complained bc if the child wasn\u2019t bothered or uncomfortable that\u2019s the only thing that matters imo (kid of divorce myself it\u2019s not/shouldn\u2019t be about the parents at this point)", "We do it here in Finland in every age groups \ud83d\ude03 What kind of showers and locker rooms you have there in your swimming halls in US?

Seems totally normal and wholesome. Ive showered at such gyms myself and have no issues with that.\n\nMy answer was specifically how that situation is different than this situation. This is two people alone in private. One has a position of authority over the other. Even then, I'd think this was more of a cultural misunderstanding than anything else, except the biggest difference. This guy is insisting. And making weird comments comparing his body, the father's body, and the child's body. \n\nIf OP had said, sorry didn't know you felt that way, won't happen again, I'd say this was a NAH situation. But who insists on their right to shower with a child in private who's old enough to shower by themselves?", "I'm pretty sure most schools (except maybe weird ones in the South) have put the kibosh on making children shower in a large room together.
