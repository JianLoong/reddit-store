I never loved Lily and she never loved me. But we were young 20 year old's who found ourselves with an unexpected pregnancy and both sets of our families were telling us the right thing to do was marry and give our kid a family. With so much pressure on us we did and we had our daughter when we were 21 followed by our son two years later. Our marriage was unhealthy, toxic, there was no love and eventually I moved out and filed for divorce. We got along better initially until Lily realized I wanted 50-50 of the kids and that I wasn't going to let her keep them and be a paycheck. Everything changed once that happened. The kids were 2 and 4 at the time and it was a very messy time. Two years after the divorce was finalized I met my current wife Thali. We got married last year after being together for three and we recently welcomed our first child together.\n\nLily was extremely unhappy when I met Thali. She became even more difficult to co-parent with and she started to engage in parental alienation. She was nasty to Thali and used our kids as pawns. I tried to speak to her, she told me to fuck off, to leave her and her kids the fuck alone, and that no other woman is going to be a parent to her children. I needed to bring it to court, I have spent thousands on court fees, GAL feels, therapist fees (ex refuses to fund therapy for our kids) and ultimately we were told to avoid each other and to not sit together or speak in front of the kids. That's all that came from it. My kids are indifferent at best to Thali and they were not excited to become big siblings to our son. It's tragic that it has come to this because of Lily. But we're at the best point we have been for a while. My older kids aren't close to Thali or their brother but at least they're not hostile and witnessing arguments between their parents. We no longer co-parent and we do something called parallel parenting because we cannot communicate. Lily has married since also.\n\nMy parents and I were able to patch things up after they apologized for pushing the marriage and they said they realized it was not the best thing for anyone. But they have been extremely bothered by Thali and the kids' relationship and the lack of enthusiasm or expression of love from the kids to their brother. While Thali was still pregnant my parents ran into the kids while they were with Lily and they started talking about them becoming big siblings. Lily yelled and cursed at them and told them to shut the fuck up and they will only ever have one sibling. My parents were furious. They then came to me and told me I should make Lily respect them. I told them I could not, and that Lily is a grown woman and the courts have spoken, so they need to just avoid her if they don't want her yelling at them. My parents told me my attitude is wrong and is going to harm my kids if I don't make their mother stop. They're still angry and now I feel like I need to ask.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672318086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy4m1h/aita_for_telling_my_parents_to_stay_away_from_my/", "score": 748, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are all sorts of factors that subconsciously lead us to see kids as tied much more strongly to the mother than the father (e.g. the whole pregnancy experience), so maybe a stepchild on the maternal side would tend to feel like more of a sibling than a stepchild on the paternal side.\n\nBut of course individuals vary, so I'm not suggesting this bias explains your situation.", "I have definitely heard a preference for maternal half siblings vs paternal, but that usually had to do with the mom having considerably more custody.\n\nI personally didn\u2019t feel any bond with my maternal half brother for years. I was a good chunk older than him and generally not fond of kids as it was. If you\u2019re not *really* into babies and toddlers, they honestly suck to be around. They have minimal personality outside of screaming and crying all the time, and toddlers are fast moving, overstimulating balls of stress that demand all parental attention. Now that we\u2019re both older I think he\u2019s a cool kid I\u2019m happy to have as a sibling. \n\nIt\u2019s not too surprising that they\u2019re not all that thrilled about a new sibling yet. As they all age, it will hopefully get easier for everyone to get along.", "It might for sure.", "NTA.  Your parents are living in fantasy land.  You know what your real options are and it sounds like you have made your peace with what is possible.  Keep doing the best you can to maintain healthy relationships with your wife and with all your children.", ">They then came to me and told me I should make Lily respect them....  ....My parents told me my attitude is wrong and is going to harm my kids if I don't make their mother stop.\n\nAnd these are the same parents who forced you into a shotgun wedding, yes?\n\nNTA", "Your kids will see you for who you are asthma get older. My ex is an alcoholic with major emotional/manipulation issues. When kids were little, I did best to protect them from his dramas but they are now 14 and 17 and have seen all his BS for themselves on many occasions. Because I didn't buy into the BS and did my best to provide stability, my boys are fiercely loyal to me and regularly thank me for stuff that they whinged about when they were younger.  \n\nI'm telling you this as encouragement to keep being stable and loving and try to encourage Thali to do the same. (When was little and giving a lot of grief, my step-mum used to say to herself every day, \"I WILL love this child,\" and it eventually paid off).", "NTA, but if you can swing it you need to be recording every instance of her bad behavior and alienation and take her back to court!", "NTA. How are you supposed to make your ex do anything? Mom and dad are on their own.", "NTA\n\nYour ex wife is.....just wow. Your parents should stay in their lane. Your kid's relationship with Thali is not their business. Even if Lily was not toxic, your kids are not obligated to like your new wife. Is it this hard for your parents to understand that? \n\nHowever, I'll advise you to continue to monitor your kids. Lily will definitely try and poison them more.", "NTA. Your parents are expecting you to control another adult. That's impossible.", "Info. So... did you get 50-50 or not?", "This is good. Let them chew on that. Love it", "Op can't though, the courts have ruled that none of it can be talked about.", "Just put it back on your parents, and ask them what they expect you to do.  Are they wanting you to kill her?  With what you've said I don't see how there is any other way you could make her not be mean to your parents.", "NTA\nYou cannot control anyone's behaviour and especially not this woman. If you could make Lily cooperative you surely would have done.\nYour parents are pretty stupid or very naive.", "NTA. What are you supposed to do?", ">My parents told me my attitude is wrong and is going to harm my kids if I don't make their mother stop.\n\n\"Make\" her? The courts couldn't even enforce co-parenting - da fuq are you expected to do?", "NTA. Que the \"but\". Have you tried absolutely everything? Is there \"nothing\" you can do to help your kids?", "Might need to tell your parents they are doing the same thing they did when they forced you two to marry. They cannot force relationships. NTA, good luck", "I am a step parent to a teenage boy and girl for the last four years. Their mother absolutely hates me simply because I exist in their lives as another parental figure with her ex husband. She has tried to \u201cpoison\u201d their relationship with me and their father, similar to what you\u2019re experiencing. It\u2019s been a few years of this constant s***-talking about us in front of the kids when they are with her. Kids are smart\u2014as they got older they started to see through her bs, and honestly it never had an effect on their relationship with their father or me, if anything it has backfired on her. Best advice is to only say kind things about her to the kids when she gets brought up when they are with you and Thali (don\u2019t completely dismiss/avoid the topic of her), and encourage (but do not force) them to build their relationship with their younger sibling. It will all pan out in your favor. NTA\n\nAlso your parents need to butt out of it.\n\n*Edit for grammar"]}
