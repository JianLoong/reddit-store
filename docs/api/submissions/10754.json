She did end up getting child support and alimony, but there were issues with how his family structures their trust which meant she left a lot on the table.

However, my girlfriend has been getting together and commiserating with her for some reason, and now their conflict, which I have deliberately kept away from, is now bleeding into my life too. \n\nMy GF keeps bringing up how unfair what my friend did was, how he\u2019s barely paying anything while they struggle, etc. etc. despite me saying that it\u2019s none of our business repeatedly.

They had a child together about 1.5+ years ago and things just weren\u2019t working between them: there were some issues with attraction, he felt it was getting monotonous, he was interested in pursuing other relationships (and ending up finding a spark with a then coworker who\u2019s now his gf), and the whole thing was just a mess. She did end up getting child support and alimony, but there were issues with how his family structures their trust which meant she left a lot on the table. Still even now it\u2019s not like she\u2019s actually below the poverty line or anything, so it\u2019s whatever.\n\nI didn\u2019t think we would be seeing much more of her since she\u2019s my friend\u2019s wife who we weren\u2019t particularly close with, and there's no real reason why we would need to have any more contact than him given that she was his wife. However, my girlfriend has been getting together and commiserating with her for some reason, and now their conflict, which I have deliberately kept away from, is now bleeding into my life too. \n\nMy GF keeps bringing up how unfair what my friend did was, how he\u2019s barely paying anything while they struggle, etc. etc. despite me saying that it\u2019s none of our business repeatedly. Shes constantly passive aggressive towards Anthony even though he hasn\u2019t done anything to her. She\u2019s even brought Carly over while me and Anthony were hanging out saying she\u2019s her friend and she\u2019s allowed to have guests. As you can guess this has led to some heated arguments. She\u2019s glad to know he\u2019s having fun eating edibles and playing video games with children (yes, she even referred to me and our other friend as children to our face - we\u2019re both 22) while she\u2019s exhausted taking care of their child alone, etc..\n\nNow keep in mind this is MY house. My parents gifted me this condo when I graduated, and I pay all the utility bills. I\u2019m letting my GF stay here because her roommate didn\u2019t want to renew the lease. She\u2019s trying to frame this like I\u2019m \u201cnot letting her see her friends\u201d, which is absurd. She\u2019s clearly 100% in the wrong here, right? AITA or is she for trying to bring this woman into our home?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she\u2019s only a guest and this is temporary, then the time table for how long she is welcome and what her privileges are should\u2019ve been communicated clearly to her.\n\nEdit: Also, they\u2019re both obviously inviting over people who cause problems. My guess is OP\u2019s girlfriend and OP friend\u2019s ex-wife had a friendship prior to the divorce, so it shouldn\u2019t be a concern that either are being invited if it\u2019s truly none of their business", "No reason?

We bought the house with my income (he didnt have a stable job) and his deposit (his dad gifted it so his beloved son on condition of the latter buying a house, it was a sizeable sum).

I don't under the OP's girlfriend being mad at the the friend for not supporting his ex (in the manner she thinks appropriate) when she is living rent free in the OP's house.

I wasn't sure if I was reading that correctly and I wasn't. I thought it was a month because it wasn't specified, there was a trust fund involved, and I've always child support written as monthly not yearly. \n\nMy mistake, it's $10K/year. So $833/month which is 20% of his pretax income.", "Thank you for clarifying. I wasn't sure if I was reading that correctly.", "The friend is the Ahole here.

It's a temporary arrangement? \n\nI find it hard to believe this argument would hold up if say, you didn't like your gf/bfs' friend for XYZ reason, and didn't prefer them around. It seems only convenient that people are saying she is allowed to bring who she wants into HER home. If the argument is it's her home, then I argue it's THEIR home. Both parties have equal rights to decide who is and is not allowed in the home. \n\nCompromise may be in order.", "I actually don't disagree with not letting your SO live with you in certain situations.
