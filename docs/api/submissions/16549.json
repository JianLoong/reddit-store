All of my family and support network are back in the U.K. and I don\u2019t have the legal right to stay here permanently. Rob suggested we get married just so I can stay here but more and more I\u2019m wanting to move home. The cost of healthcare here honestly terrifies me too and I\u2019m worried in case there are complications with my pregnancy or me or the baby get ill in the future. \n\nI told Rob what I was thinking and he was upset as he wants to be able to be present in our child\u2019s life. I said we could still get married to help him move to the U.K. but he is worried he\u2019d have no friends or family or job there and has said that if I stay here I\u2019ll at least have a job.\n\nI know I need to decide before I get too pregnant to fly long haul but I\u2019m worried if I wait to have the baby here I\u2019ll be trapped for 18 years.

He can visit while the child is young, and once the child is older then the child can visit the US and get to know Rob\u2019s family.  \n\nIt will be up to Rob to file for the child\u2019s US Report of Child Born Abroad once paternity is established.

I understand both positions. Nevertheless I vote NTA.\n\nYou carry the child, you give birth to the baby. If you plan on breastfeeding the heavy lifting in the first month's falls almost entirely to you (no shade to fathers, they can help in a lot of other ways and many do). You will need a support systems that is about you as well, not just the baby. So many new moms loose themselves in their role because they don't get time for themselves. So many new moms have to battle PPD - not a walk in the park in any situation much less without the help of your family and/or trusted friends. \n\nAsk yourself if a man you have had a casual relationship with will put your needs ahead of his own? \n\nLook out for yourself and your mental health, do what is best for you in this situation.

It would be best to move were you have a good support system and Healthcare you can actually afford to use. He will have to figure out the logistics of visiting and moving to the UK.

It isn't a good situation for him. But if you stay it wouldn't be for you.", "NAH. Honestly, this situation majorly sucks. Your support systems are in different countries, you want to move to the UK while he wants to stay in the US. If neither of you are able to compromise, someone will end up unhappy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a bad person for wanting you to stay, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily a bad person either. Idk why people are taking Rob being upset as a red flag, he\u2019s going to have a child that he potentially will never be able to see. I will say, that when you are in another country and if you do have a custody agreement, your child may choose to move in with him majorly when they are old enough, so that\u2019s definitely a risk that you have to be willing to take. Don\u2019t make this decision rashly, you have to think it over. And please don\u2019t think that one of you having family there is more important than the other. Good luck.", "Don't let him know just pack up and go home, call him when you hit the UK.", "I would move. \n\nYou can always reconsider and move back, but I wouldn't let someone else decide whether or not I can go back home to live.\nAnd I would want MY support system near, specially if the relationship isn't promising aside from being co parents.\nAs you said, you can also help HIM move.\n\nI'm not sure about the legalities in the US, if he could make it harder for you to leave while pregnant if he gets a lawyer involved. Just a heads up.", "I get that your whole support system is in the UK, but his whole support system is here. You're asking him to give up what you are not willing to give up. Would he even be able to find a job there? Housing? If he does, are you willing to go 50/50 custody? Does he even have the money to move and start a new life? \n\nHow would you feel if someone told you they were taking your child to a country an ocean away that you knew nothing about? \n\nIt feels like you know this will mean cutting him out of the child's life. YTA", "You need to go home as soon as you can. \n\nMaybe doing so will mean you are an asshole to Rob, but sometimes you just have to be an asshole.  This is your life you are talking about.  Don't get married to someone you don't want to stay with, and don't get stuck here in the U.S. if you don't see yourself living here forever.", "NAH and I think anyone calling him an asshole is being incredibly unfair. He\u2019s not wrong that logistically she\u2019s already in the US and has a job so it\u2019s easier for her to stay than for him to go. He has a right to want his child near him. She also has a right to want her support system. Neither of them are inherently wrong. The whole situation sucks though and no matter where they end up it\u2019s going to suck for the kid having parents or families on two different continents. Either way the kid is largely cut off from one half of his or her family. There\u2019s no good answer here.", "NAH unless you decide not to let Rob be involved in his child\u2019s life. He deserves to be a parent just as much as you will be. You might be the mother, but he is the father. Be fair to him.", "NAH. You\u2019re both in a really challenging situation but you have to prioritise yourself and your child. Id go back to free health, my friends and family now. It\u2019ll be much harder once the child is born and you have to consider what would happen if the relationship breaks down or you lose your job or have a medical emergency. You\u2019d be so isolated if you stay there. But, you should also acknowledge that it\u2019s an awful situation for him and do what you can to support him", "NAH- That IS a horrible situation for everyone involved. I feel more for Rob and your child than for you, though. You have ALL the power here to do what's best for you. Rob can be without his child. His child can grow up without a involved father. Your are not an AH to do the best for you and move back, he won't be an AH for doing everything in his Power to stop you. He has rights as a father. I Hope he fights for being in his child's life.", "YTA. You\u2019re having a child with a man and you\u2019re taking away his right to be a father and it\u2019s selfish to make your child grow up without one.

She should absolutely leave and not think twice about it", "LOL men are not guarantees for support.", "Having a partner and the child's father IS important, I never said it wasn't. I never said she should leave him. \n\nThey are at an impass and need to work through this, I simply said she wasn't an asshole for wanting to be near her family for a huge life changing event.\n\nLikewise, he also needs a support system, so I do see why he wouldn't want to move. This is a delicate situation that will effect them both and their child. They need to decide what will be best in the long run.", "Sounds like a him problem. Not worth getting trapped in a shitty country over.", "NTA. Get home and take care of yourself and your baby.", "A.H. Both of you are in a really challenging situation but you have to prioritize yourself and your child. ID free health, my friends and family go back now. It will be more difficult after the baby is born and you have to consider what happens if the relationship breaks up or you lose your job or have a medical emergency.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Honestly this is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade", "I agree it would be simplest to just get the abortion to avoid this entire issue", "As an American woman, agreed, hit the nail on the head. I'd book that plane ticket now, he can join, visit, or not. NTA", "She's 34 years old, her and ex had tried to have children and she had thought it would never happen.  She is HAPPY about having a baby so no, it's not an option for her.", "What's wrong with you? She wants the kid as does the dad so this comment you made twice is not even applicable.  And yes I am pro choice.", "And we all think you are an ID10T.", "She said she\u2019s happy to become a mom, why are you bringing up an abortion?", "Why are you like this?", "you only need one look at american politics, laws, and healthcare systems and practices to see why she should go. acting like it would be a bigger sacrifice for him to leave than it would be for her to stay is incredibly callous and selfish.", "I don\u2019t know, not selfishly? Like he expects her to trust that he is dependable but he refuses all other alternatives while expecting of her what he is not willing to do? Hell no.", "I agreed, she is doing what's best for *her* going back to UK.\n\nBut both these AH created a situation where the kid will miss their father, or have one bitter about being here.", "LOL this is the most brain dead comment I\u2019ve seen on this sub", "LOL gladly. YOU spend nine months of hell growing a baby, culminating in days of labour and delivery. Then YOU can decide where the fuck you and your pregnant self want to live. Until that happens, we will decide where WE live.", "So she has to give up her family and friends for a relationship that might not work out? She has no safety net, no right to be in the US once her contract runs out and would be taking a massive chance on marrying someone she hardly knows.", "She\u2019s not even a U.S. citizen why should she stay somewhere where pregnant women have fewer rights, more expensive medical bills, and she has zero support system and only a job that was intended to be there temporarily? Staying would involve becoming a citizen which doesn\u2019t appear to be what she wants.", "**I would normally say Y T A but we are talking about the US with the high healthcare costs, lack of social safety net and short to non-existent parental leaves. You are NTA, the father can move with you.**", "This account is a bot, comment stolen from u/Otherwise-Owl7240\n\nplease report spam - malicious bots", "This account is a bot, comment stolen from u/Otherwise-Owl7240\n\nplease report spam - malicious bots", "Is this trying to be a joke?", "Agree. I'm extremely pro choice. Abortion isn't the choice she wants to make. Let's not swing so far the other way now.\n\nOP needs to leave the US like now.", "Didn't think it would happen, yet told Rob she was on the pill...", "I agreeing that moving is best option for OP. \n\nBut your expecting him to just shrug off that his child is being taken overseas, forever. It's a no win situation that these 2 x AH created for them and their baby.", "How selfless is it to let a woman you only knew fir a year take your baby over the Atlantic? How selfless is it to be an absentee father? \n\nI think she's right to go back to UK, but it's fair to say ESH for creating this situation.", "The way you think getting pregnant should prevent you from leaving to your own country is crazy. You couldn\u2019t pay me to have kids in the United states. Worst  developed country to rise kids in.", "The UK is safer for any person to live in than the States.", "And the baby. Infant mortality rates, civil hostility, school shootings, a wide social security net from healthcare to education. \n\nShe\u2019s not an asshole. She got pregnant while on a temporary work assignment and wants to go home. That\u2019s normal and logical behaviour. He\u2019s an asshole for expecting her to live in the USA, a crumbling country that would increase her chances of literally dying in labour and would saddle her with enormous hospital bills to boot. That\u2019s actually insane of him to ask this.", "Pretty selfish.", "This is a spam bot repost.", "An anti-choice crusader who thinks they're being clever, I'm thinking.", "Because she **is** on the pill....", "He\u2019s not letting her do anything. She is a full human being. He doesn\u2019t have a choice. So he can\u2019t be selfless over this by not doing something he can\u2019t do. If he was selfless, he\u2019d do why he is asking if her and move to a better country where the woman carrying his child would have the best support. \n\nShe\u2019s not an asshole. She had sex while on birth control and it failed. She got pregnant. Her wanting to go back home is not selfish. It\u2019s practical.", "Why ESH and not NAH? (The real asshole is the American healthcare system.)", "Have you looked at cost of living, here? It's no paradise.\n\nAgain, she's making right practical choice for her. But he's got every right to be pissed off his child is being taken away. \n\nIs he making the most rational requests right now? No. Would you if it were your baby that you'll probably never get to see born? He cab be in the wrong and still not the *only* AH in this story.", "Yeah, you are selfish. You not only expect women to endure the hardships of pregnancy but also expect to dictate where she can LIVE?! Like the audacity to have an orgasm  and think you now should have rights over her is actually astonishing. Men are not reliable sources of support. \n\nBut if making sure that I have support and a village as I help mould a literal human being makes me selfish, then I\u2019d rather be selfish and secure then stupid and trapped. ESPECIALLY in a sub par country that poses both me and my child a significant risk. HE can make a singular sacrifice after she sacrifices her body, her health, her earnings potential and risks her life in an incredibly painful and dangerous medical event that literally ALLOWS him the chance to be a father. He can show her that he is willing to make sacrifices, do what\u2019s hard, and put in the work to be a father.", "First spam I've ever agreed with", "Sure, she just so happened to get the baby she wanted but couldn't have before with her ex, and now has one with a man she can leave behind in USA...\n\nBurlt, TBF, he's an idiot too for not wearing protection.", "I 100% agree getting back to her family is best for her. \n\nBest for kid...Time will tell. \n\nShe didn't expect to get pregnant, yet wanted to and told him and us she is on the pill... did a Dr give her a reason to believe she couldn't have a baby?", "This isn't only about the HC, though. She has family back here, it makes sense to come back to that. \n\nBut they both hooked up, taking the risk of pregnancy. That's why ESH.", "She is single, in the states for a year. She is a smart woman and decided if she was going to be having sex, she wouldn\u2019t want to risk getting pregnant from some international affair, as it complicates things, so she takes the pill. It fails. Just because she isn\u2019t upset about being pregnant doesn\u2019t mean she was baby trapping him. Lots of women everywhere are happy with their accident baby\u2019s that they actively tried to avoid having.", "Not all forms of contraception are 100% effective. I have gotten pregnant while on the pill.", "Absolutely best for the kid. They won\u2019t have to be worried about being shot at a movie or sitting in class. They won\u2019t have to fork out thousands of dollars for a doctors visit or to go to university. The food standards are better, the education is better\u2026. \n\nShe\u2019s on the pill. Like holy shit. Her and her ex husband were unable to have a child, so she, like many women before her, assumed she was infertile or at least had difficulties reproducing. But she\u2019s also in another country for a year, and wants to date and have sex. So she gets on the pill just in case to try and avoid this situation. But it happens. And she wants to be a mom. Stop trying to make her some nefarious character for committing the sin of getting pregnant in a foreign country but wanting to go home.", "I don't think having consensual sex makes someone an AH, absent other factors.", "Lol how?", "Not denying that, but OP claims she didn't think she could even get pregnant.", "And who suffers fromher being wring about being able to conceive? Not her. Funnily enough she gets pregnant just on time...", "That shit happens. People take birth control pills for other reasons than to prevent pregnancy."]}
