All of my family and support network are back in the U.K. and I don\u2019t have the legal right to stay here permanently.

I said we could still get married to help him move to the U.K. but he is worried he\u2019d have no friends or family or job there and has said that if I stay here I\u2019ll at least have a job.\n\nI know I need to decide before I get too pregnant to fly long haul but I\u2019m worried if I wait to have the baby here I\u2019ll be trapped for 18 years.

He can visit while the child is young, and once the child is older then the child can visit the US and get to know Rob\u2019s family.  \n\nIt will be up to Rob to file for the child\u2019s US Report of Child Born Abroad once paternity is established.

I understand both positions. Nevertheless I vote NTA.\n\nYou carry the child, you give birth to the baby. If you plan on breastfeeding the heavy lifting in the first month's falls almost entirely to you (no shade to fathers, they can help in a lot of other ways and many do). You will need a support systems that is about you as well, not just the baby. So many new moms loose themselves in their role because they don't get time for themselves. So many new moms have to battle PPD - not a walk in the park in any situation much less without the help of your family and/or trusted friends. \n\nAsk yourself if a man you have had a casual relationship with will put your needs ahead of his own? \n\nLook out for yourself and your mental health, do what is best for you in this situation.

It would be best to move were you have a good support system and Healthcare you can actually afford to use. He will have to figure out the logistics of visiting and moving to the UK.

It isn't a good situation for him. But if you stay it wouldn't be for you.", "NAH. Honestly, this situation majorly sucks. Your support systems are in different countries, you want to move to the UK while he wants to stay in the US. If neither of you are able to compromise, someone will end up unhappy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a bad person for wanting you to stay, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily a bad person either. Idk why people are taking Rob being upset as a red flag, he\u2019s going to have a child that he potentially will never be able to see. I will say, that when you are in another country and if you do have a custody agreement, your child may choose to move in with him majorly when they are old enough, so that\u2019s definitely a risk that you have to be willing to take. Don\u2019t make this decision rashly, you have to think it over. And please don\u2019t think that one of you having family there is more important than the other. Good luck.", "Don't let him know just pack up and go home, call him when you hit the UK.", "I would move. \n\nYou can always reconsider and move back, but I wouldn't let someone else decide whether or not I can go back home to live.\nAnd I would want MY support system near, specially if the relationship isn't promising aside from being co parents.\nAs you said, you can also help HIM move.\n\nI'm not sure about the legalities in the US, if he could make it harder for you to leave while pregnant if he gets a lawyer involved. Just a heads up.", "I get that your whole support system is in the UK, but his whole support system is here. You're asking him to give up what you are not willing to give up. Would he even be able to find a job there? Housing? If he does, are you willing to go 50/50 custody? Does he even have the money to move and start a new life? \n\nHow would you feel if someone told you they were taking your child to a country an ocean away that you knew nothing about? \n\nIt feels like you know this will mean cutting him out of the child's life. YTA", "You need to go home as soon as you can. \n\nMaybe doing so will mean you are an asshole to Rob, but sometimes you just have to be an asshole.  This is your life you are talking about.  Don't get married to someone you don't want to stay with, and don't get stuck here in the U.S. if you don't see yourself living here forever.", "NAH and I think anyone calling him an asshole is being incredibly unfair. He\u2019s not wrong that logistically she\u2019s already in the US and has a job so it\u2019s easier for her to stay than for him to go. He has a right to want his child near him. She also has a right to want her support system. Neither of them are inherently wrong. The whole situation sucks though and no matter where they end up it\u2019s going to suck for the kid having parents or families on two different continents. Either way the kid is largely cut off from one half of his or her family. There\u2019s no good answer here.", "NAH unless you decide not to let Rob be involved in his child\u2019s life. He deserves to be a parent just as much as you will be. You might be the mother, but he is the father. Be fair to him.", "NAH. You\u2019re both in a really challenging situation but you have to prioritise yourself and your child. Id go back to free health, my friends and family now. It\u2019ll be much harder once the child is born and you have to consider what would happen if the relationship breaks down or you lose your job or have a medical emergency. You\u2019d be so isolated if you stay there. But, you should also acknowledge that it\u2019s an awful situation for him and do what you can to support him", "NAH- That IS a horrible situation for everyone involved. I feel more for Rob and your child than for you, though. You have ALL the power here to do what's best for you. Rob can be without his child. His child can grow up without a involved father. Your are not an AH to do the best for you and move back, he won't be an AH for doing everything in his Power to stop you. He has rights as a father. I Hope he fights for being in his child's life.", "YTA. You\u2019re having a child with a man and you\u2019re taking away his right to be a father and it\u2019s selfish to make your child grow up without one.

So she can leave if she wants to. And arguably, UK has a lot to offer on top of her support network - it has free universal healthcare (the NHS has issues, but arguably, should something go wrong, it could REALLY costly in the US), parental leave, some financial support for said parental leave, less gun violence, better women\u2019s rights policies at the moment etc. Although she is in New York and not in a state where they\u2019ve really been restricting things as of last year. \n\nThe fact is - until she can fly to the UK and hasn\u2019t given birth, the father\u2019s rights are basically \u201con-hold\u201d, as bad as it sounds. It may not be a nice way to put it, but that\u2019s the harsh reality. The moment she gives birth though, he can legally demand that the child not leave the country. And idk how it works with the British citizenship, but in some countries, if you have a child with a foreigner, said foreigner has to approve that the child get the citizenship of other parent, in addition to the citizenship of birth country. Again, she\u2019s in NY, which means that should she start labour early or even in the worst case scenario, miscarry, she won\u2019t be labeled with something she didn\u2019t do (like in some states that have started to equal spontaneous miscarriages with abortions), but the fact is that the US has been heading in a way that\u2019s not very supportive for women and raising kids in general. She has the option to choose right now - she may not have that option later.\n\nAs for the father - it\u2019s a crappy situation for him. His emotions and feelings are valid and understandable. And whilst there is only 5-6 plane ride difference between the UK and USA, cross-Atlantic flights are no joke and arguably, he would be the one having to travel (and find the finances for it), because the child would be too young to do so. But the fact is that he cannot stop her from leaving and getting married only a few months after knowing each other (and not even that well) is generally, but not always, a fairly bad founding for a long-term relationship. Not to mention that OP would have to place A LOT of trust in the father not to essentially trap her and keep her locked in the US for the next 18 years. \n\nIt\u2019s a NAH situation for me.

Congratulations!! I was pregnant. I had been heavy bleeding for 3 days by then, there is no way I was still pregnant. They then told me to come back in a month and do another blood test to make sure that the hormones went down. That is the extent of care.
