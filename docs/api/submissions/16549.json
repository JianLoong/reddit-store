I found out in February that I was pregnant. It was a complete shock, I\u2019m on the pill but I somehow got pregnant anyway.

The issue is that I\u2019m worried if I have the baby here I\u2019ll be trapped in the US. All of my family and support network are back in the U.K. and I don\u2019t have the legal right to stay here permanently. Rob suggested we get married just so I can stay here but more and more I\u2019m wanting to move home. The cost of healthcare here honestly terrifies me too and I\u2019m worried in case there are complications with my pregnancy or me or the baby get ill in the future. \n\nI told Rob what I was thinking and he was upset as he wants to be able to be present in our child\u2019s life. I said we could still get married to help him move to the U.K. but he is worried he\u2019d have no friends or family or job there and has said that if I stay here I\u2019ll at least have a job.\n\nI know I need to decide before I get too pregnant to fly long haul but I\u2019m worried if I wait to have the baby here I\u2019ll be trapped for 18 years.

So his argument he doesn\u2019t know anyone there is the same argument you have about staying in the US.   You are at an impass.  The difference is that you are the pregnant person, and the person who has to give birth and will then be legally responsible for medical bills if you stay in the US.  \n\nYou were causally dating Rob, and thought you were preventing pregnancy.  Lady Fate had other ideas, as can happen. \n\nIf you want to go home, go home.  Rob can easily come for a visit.  The UK and the US have agreed to enforce each other\u2019s child support orders.  You can explore if you want more with Rob or not, and if not, that is OK as well.  He can visit while the child is young, and once the child is older then the child can visit the US and get to know Rob\u2019s family.  \n\nIt will be up to Rob to file for the child\u2019s US Report of Child Born Abroad once paternity is established.

I don't think this is a situation where you can both get what you want, not unless you wanted a long-distance relationship, but you definitely need to figure it out soon before it's too late.", "NTA. Babies are expensive. I'm in the uk and had a baby a couple of weeks ago.

There is nothing to say that at some time in the future, you might move back to the US but trying to stay there now with no support is not a good idea.", "NTA. Though you may want to talk to a lawyer sooner rather than later.", "I would talk to a lawyer, but if I were pregnant with a guy that I wasn't serious about, I would want to be near my family and be in a place with free healthcare and no school shootings. If something happens here and you end up jobless, would Rob support or or would he have moved on. Atleast there as a single mom, you'd have a support network. Please don't get married just for the sake of it.", "Hm. Congrats on the baby! \n\nNTA to me. Having a support system around the mum is pretty important. And it seems that Rob wants to comparent but not be a support system for you. \n\nAnd - I mean, flights exist.

It makes financial sense to give birth in the UK. The US health-care system is broken.\n\nYou're willing to let Rob in the kids life, but want to live in the UK.

So there was no deciet.\n\nIts up to him to decide if he wants to travel, move, or walk away.", "NTA but you need to move *YESTERDAY*", "Yikes, what a difficult situation for the both of you to be in. I understand both positions. Nevertheless I vote NTA.\n\nYou carry the child, you give birth to the baby. If you plan on breastfeeding the heavy lifting in the first month's falls almost entirely to you (no shade to fathers, they can help in a lot of other ways and many do). You will need a support systems that is about you as well, not just the baby. So many new moms loose themselves in their role because they don't get time for themselves. So many new moms have to battle PPD - not a walk in the park in any situation much less without the help of your family and/or trusted friends. \n\nAsk yourself if a man you have had a casual relationship with will put your needs ahead of his own? \n\nLook out for yourself and your mental health, do what is best for you in this situation. Good luck to you, OP.

Return to where you have a support system and a low maternity mortality rate if you have the option.", "Go back to the UK for the health care.\n\nKeep in mind that if the baby is born in the US, it will have to pay taxes to the USA regardless where it lives in the world.  \n\nIt's better off not being an accidental American.  NTA.", "Neither of you are the asshole because want to be parents and have the support of your communities. If it a question of what should you do, leave, move back to the UK. A good parent would want what\u2019s best for the child and that\u2019s good healthcare, good education system, and gun control. It\u2019s not safe for the kid here so you should move", "Nta your reasons make sense.", "Seeing as you clearly don't see a future with Rob. It would be best to move were you have a good support system and Healthcare you can actually afford to use. He will have to figure out the logistics of visiting and moving to the UK. You're not his wife or mom. Let him do the work.", "Nothing against Rob but RUN!!! You will be stuck here.", "NAH. You have to do what's right for you but your partner isn't an AH for not wanting to be an ocean away from his kid or for not wanting to move an ocean away from his life.", "Move home now sweetie.", "NHS is all I\u2019m saying.", "INFO: did he know about the way of your birth control amd that you planned to go back before having sex with you?\nBecause then he knew the risk.\nDon't get me wrong. It isn't a good situation for him. But if you stay it wouldn't be for you.", "NAH. Honestly, this situation majorly sucks. Your support systems are in different countries, you want to move to the UK while he wants to stay in the US. If neither of you are able to compromise, someone will end up unhappy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a bad person for wanting you to stay, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily a bad person either. Idk why people are taking Rob being upset as a red flag, he\u2019s going to have a child that he potentially will never be able to see. I will say, that when you are in another country and if you do have a custody agreement, your child may choose to move in with him majorly when they are old enough, so that\u2019s definitely a risk that you have to be willing to take. Don\u2019t make this decision rashly, you have to think it over. And please don\u2019t think that one of you having family there is more important than the other. Good luck.", "Don't let him know just pack up and go home, call him when you hit the UK.", "I would move. \n\nYou can always reconsider and move back, but I wouldn't let someone else decide whether or not I can go back home to live.\nAnd I would want MY support system near, specially if the relationship isn't promising aside from being co parents.\nAs you said, you can also help HIM move.\n\nI'm not sure about the legalities in the US, if he could make it harder for you to leave while pregnant if he gets a lawyer involved. Just a heads up.", "I get that your whole support system is in the UK, but his whole support system is here. You're asking him to give up what you are not willing to give up. Would he even be able to find a job there? Housing? If he does, are you willing to go 50/50 custody? Does he even have the money to move and start a new life? \n\nHow would you feel if someone told you they were taking your child to a country an ocean away that you knew nothing about? \n\nIt feels like you know this will mean cutting him out of the child's life. YTA", "You need to go home as soon as you can. \n\nMaybe doing so will mean you are an asshole to Rob, but sometimes you just have to be an asshole.  This is your life you are talking about.  Don't get married to someone you don't want to stay with, and don't get stuck here in the U.S. if you don't see yourself living here forever.", "NAH and I think anyone calling him an asshole is being incredibly unfair. He\u2019s not wrong that logistically she\u2019s already in the US and has a job so it\u2019s easier for her to stay than for him to go. He has a right to want his child near him. She also has a right to want her support system. Neither of them are inherently wrong. The whole situation sucks though and no matter where they end up it\u2019s going to suck for the kid having parents or families on two different continents. Either way the kid is largely cut off from one half of his or her family. There\u2019s no good answer here.", "NAH unless you decide not to let Rob be involved in his child\u2019s life. He deserves to be a parent just as much as you will be. You might be the mother, but he is the father. Be fair to him.", "NAH. You\u2019re both in a really challenging situation but you have to prioritise yourself and your child. Id go back to free health, my friends and family now. It\u2019ll be much harder once the child is born and you have to consider what would happen if the relationship breaks down or you lose your job or have a medical emergency. You\u2019d be so isolated if you stay there. But, you should also acknowledge that it\u2019s an awful situation for him and do what you can to support him", "NAH- That IS a horrible situation for everyone involved. I feel more for Rob and your child than for you, though. You have ALL the power here to do what's best for you. Rob can be without his child. His child can grow up without a involved father. Your are not an AH to do the best for you and move back, he won't be an AH for doing everything in his Power to stop you. He has rights as a father. I Hope he fights for being in his child's life.", "YTA. You\u2019re having a child with a man and you\u2019re taking away his right to be a father and it\u2019s selfish to make your child grow up without one.
