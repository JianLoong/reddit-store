{"id": 10409, "submission_id": "116mn0s", "title": "AITA for locking up my makeup?", "selftext": "I (16F) get a weekly allowance and I also have a part time job, and if I want to buy expensive stuff I save for a while since my family isn't rich. I tend to spend my money on clothes and drugstore makeup but don't buy too often (usually every month or so I'll get something new, or if something I have runs out). Occasionally, I make a decision to save for a while and buy something luxury (makeup-wise). I have 3 makeup items from designer brands, which are an eyeshadow palette, a blush and a lip tint.\n\nRecently, my extended family came to stay with us for a couple weeks from abroad. One of my cousins is around a year younger than me and the other two are under the age of 7.\n\nI have my makeup in my room, in the top drawer of my chest of drawers alongside my jewellery. The expensive stuff used to be in a separate small box in this drawer (which doesn't have a lid).\n\nOn Friday, I got home from school and opened the drawer to put away a new necklace I got, when I saw that my expensive makeup was gone from the box. I asked the oldest cousin if she knew where it went, and she said that she saw her siblings rummaging around in that drawer half an hour ago.\n\nI go to the room they're sharing and see them on the floor, using my expensive makeup and I guess playing with it? The youngest one had destroyed my blush pretty bad (aka the powder was all crushed up and the embossed design was gone, it was still usable though), the lip tint and eyeshadow were more or less ok. I got really upset and took my stuff away from them, and found a box with a lid which I put it in. I then hid the box away under some of my clothes in a different drawer.\n\nCut to today. I go to my friend's house for a couple hours, and when I get back my oldest cousin starts talking to me aggressively about how she went in my drawer only to see my fancy makeup missing. I asked her why she was looking in my drawer for the makeup anyway and she got really defensive and said that she just wanted to try it out and that hiding it away after one incident was a bit extreme of me. I know it sounds stupid but I care about the stuff I had to save for over a month to buy (for each item).\n\nShe got her parents involved who said I have no right to be locking my things away, and that I need to put it back where it was and get rid of the new box or whatever it was in now. I mentioned the incident with my younger cousins and they said that if I had siblings I'd understand this is just how little kids are. My parents don't really care about where I stored my stuff, as long as my room is tidy. But my cousin has been acting really cold to me now, and I don't know why. Was it rude of me to hide my things where they can't get to them?\n\nedit: I meant to say hiding away my makeup with the title, I bought a lockbox for my other stuff and my makeup but it's not here yet so that's why I hid it for now", "created_utc": 1676837456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116mn0s/aita_for_locking_up_my_makeup/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't matter how much they cost-- this isn't a matter of you not wanting to share, this is a matter of them not asking for permission. So instead of you having the opportunity to share some of your less expensive makeup to \"play\" with, they are getting upset with you for wanting to protect something that is more valuable that you have bought with your own money.\n\nHave a discussion and say that you're willing to share some things, but not all, and that in order for you to share, they need to first ask for permission. As an adult, you wouldn't go around rooting through someone else's stuff and taking it without asking, and this is something that kids have to learn. The parents are at fault here for not intervening and teaching their kids that they can't go through someone's stuff or take things without permission.", "NTA\n\nTell her she needs to stay out of other people's belongings.

Further, it's not like these children are two or three. Seven is more than old enough to know not to touch other people's things without permission.\n\nThe only reason for someone to get upset about you locking up expensive items is that they believe they are entitled to them. If your older cousin wants to try your makeup, she can ask, politely, if you mind, and accept your answer without whining whether the answer is \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\nIn this case, you might want to lock up even more of your things until their visit is over.", "NTA. Why are people upset that you don't make your stuff available to steal?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo your cousins are harassing you because you keep them from stealing your stuff?", "NTA. No, you are absolutely not an asshole in this situation. \n\nThe mother if these kids though... there's another story! I don't even know which point to make first. These kids are plenty old enough to know and understand boundaries and respect for other's property. They should not be allowed to even rummage around in your room, let alone into your personal effects, and especially let alone destroying your things and yet especially still introducing germs into the make up that goes on to YOUR FACE. This is not only intrusive but unsanitary. If I were you I would put a lock n my door and ask that they keep the kids out of there. There is no reason in this world that the adults here can't or shouldn't redirect these entitled children. This is where they learn that they do not have to respect other's property.", "NTA.

You were NOT rude.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour cousins' parents owe you new make-up as they failed to supervise their children.  Actually, it sounds as if they want you to leave expensive make-up where your cousins can use and destroy it.

And the older one didn't even ask, just assumed that they can use it.\n\nYour cousins parents are wrong and are not teaching then to respect other peoples belongings.", "Oh, definite NTA.  And here's some polite yet evil suggestions:   \nAsk your aunt if she would mind if you used her makeup.  \n\n\nIf she says no (and I'm betting she will, all huffy and angry)  ask her why not.  \n\n\nThat will probably be another angry outburst.  Wait her out, and say, \"I trust I made my point.\"  \n\n\nThen tell her that you're going to go into her luggage and use it anyway, because you know, kids these days.  \n\n\nThen suggest that if she doesn't want you using her makeup, she keeps it in her locked luggage.  \n\n\nHave fun with this, because you're in the right.", "NTA - your extended family sounds horrible.

If they want them to have those things, then you will be more than happy to tell them where you purchased it.", "NTA!!  Lock it up!! You worked for it and bought it yourself, ITS YOURS! Do what you want with it. It pisses me off when parents think that their children are entitled to someone else\u2019s belongings. Go get THEIR mom\u2019s makeup tell them that they can play with that.

If they\u2019re going to replace that makeup then sure- let the kids play with it! But if they\u2019re not (and it doesn\u2019t seem like they plan to) I would lock it up extra well and make sure they don\u2019t know what box it\u2019s in and where it is as they might throw it away as a whole. I don\u2019t even understand why they\u2019re in your room without your permission, that part also seems a bit off and rude.", "NTA. Her parents said you have no right to hide your things from their children. Are they going to replace the things their children are taking? The are not your parents, they don't live in your home and they have no right to tell you what to do with your things.

I'm sure they keep a lot of things out of their kids' hands.", "\"her parents who said I have no right to be locking my things away\"\n\nI feel like a crazy person reading this...I cant comprehend this planet", "NTA.\n1. The parents should pay to replace the makeup they ruined. That's what decent parents do, not shit parents (I'm a parent and no, kids don't just do that).\n2. It's unhygienic.

I mean you can let them THINK you tossed the box if it comes to that. I don't typically condone telling lies but if you have to lie and say it's for something else then by all means do. There are so many infections that can be brought up to your face from contaminated make up. I cannot stress this enough. No matter the cost. If these kids really are going to be allowed to run amok I say go buy the cheapest make up you can find and gift it to them. They need to stay out of your make up period.
