Just get her like a card that says 'Teeth' and say you'll take her to sign up or buy Invisalign and pay for it. Then on her B-day take whatever is left and do the same but the card says 'nose job' and you go to the plastic surgeon.", "YWBTA\n\nYou can't gift cash with restrictions. Just don't gift it.\n\nPerhaps you can set up accounts directly with specialists in rhinoplasty and whatnot.", "NAH - your heart is in the right place. You can ask her not to do the tummy tuck, but you can't actually give her conditions. Just tell her your fears and why and ask she use it for the other two things instead. But if she does the tummy tuck, she does the tummy tuck.", "YTA\n\nIf you give money, or anything else, it is the recipients, to use as they please.  If anything, get a gift certificate for Invisalign, it's a way to direct the money without telling her how to use it. Invisalign, or braces, depending on the recommendation of the orthodontist, is the least invasive of the 3 things she wants.  \n\nBoth the nose job and the tummy tuck are significant surgeries, with more potential for complications, and should be done only if directed by a doctor. And you presumably know a good local orthodontist from when you were treated.  You can probably arrange to have the orthodontist bill you directly, especially if you have an established relationship.", "If you give her cash you can\u2019t really give it with strings. However if you want to give her a nose job, offer her that gift specifically by scheduling the consultation and just giving her the brochure as her gift to open.", "YWBTA, but giving her cash isn't the only option.  There are YWNBTA options that would achieve the same goals.  \n\nYour gift could be paying directly for the thing (braces and/or corrective surgery on her nose) instead of giving her the money outriht.  I find it sad that all her wants are for things about her appearance.  This culture is too focused on women's looks when there are so many more important things.  \n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with deciding on the nature of a gift you're giving.  That's your prerogative as a gift-giver.  But if the gift is cash, the nature of cash is that it can be spent anywhere.  Her choice.  Cash with restrictions is called a gift card.  \n\nIf she wants a tummy tuck because she has serious weight problems, you might consider getting her a consult with a bariatrician NOT a plastic surgeon.  \n\nI am somewhat appalled that she blames you for ruining her figure or for the financial sacrifices parents make every day.  She gave up a lot of things when you all were kids?  No shit.  It's called being a mom. Although it's nice to want to help out, and you should if you want to, you do NOT owe her anything for raising you.  She decided to have children.  You were not consulted.  It's not a debt.  If she ever made you feel guilty for that, she was very much in the wrong.  That was not okay.  \n\nYou need to look out for your own financial security also.  If you don't already have a 3-6 months wages saved in an emergency fund, that $15K needs to go there.  You could lose this job, become disabled, have a large medical expense, or have your car die on you.  You need to make sure you have a safety net for yourself before even considering paying for cosmetic procedures for anyone.", "YTA you can't give someone a Christmas gift and then tell them how and when to use it. What you COULD do, however, is offer to pay for one of the procedures specifically as a gift", "Dr. West had lipo, breast augmentation, and a tummy tuck on the same day. She passed away from coronary artery disease and post operative complications related to her surgeries. It was a very lengthy process which increased her risks.  She also chose to recover at home. Cosmetic surgery leading to a fatal outcome is extremely rare. The two leading causes of death after any lengthy surgery are leg blood clots traveling to the lung (pulmonary embolism) and sudden heart attack.\n\nSo, don't conflate what your mother seeks with absolute risk.

Any reason why you can't just offer to pay for a nose job/invisalign?", "NAH. You can give a gift with restrictions, you just can't add other ones later.\n\nThis seems like a little restriction in my mind for a big gift.\n\nWhen I gave my kids their bikes the restriction was that they could not ride it alone in the street before i felt comfortable with their ability to ride safely.

You might get $9-10k after taxes.", "Wow. These comments are ridiculous. No you're NTA for not wanting your aging mother to have a risky procedure that you'd feel guilty for if you were involved and something bad happened.

A child should not feel guilty for how a mother's body was affected by childbirth; an accident that breaks someone's nose sucks, but it's an accident and not something to feel guilty about forever; your mother was an adult who chose not to get invisalign because she wanted to do so, not because you, a literal child at the time, told her to do that.

That means they had to pull every single one of her remaining teeth, wait for her to recover, surgically implant multiple titanium posts into her jawbone, wait for her to heal, and finally create new teeth to attach to the posts. Pretty major. Lots of pain, she had to eat nothing but mush and Ensure shakes until everything healed.
