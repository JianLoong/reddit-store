That was a self inflicted inconvenience they brought on themselves.", "NTA, you did about as good of a job as someone could have done in that scenario. \n\nYour brother and his GF are being immature because they were slightly inconvenienced.

They blocked you in when she could\u2019ve parked behind your brother\u2019s car.

That's a terrible idea, especially if a woman is in there with him.", "then NTA definitely", "Ahhh, then that's their own fault.", "Obviously I knock first to make sure everyone is decent, and this is something I have to do often. I\u2019ll knock, wait a second, then go in quietly to get her keys to move her car. This is just a situation where their door was locked and I couldn\u2019t avoid disturbing them.", "You said you couldn't near in and out because the door wa locked. I simply said do not ever do that.", "And I\u2019m clarifying what I meant by that. Me entering and exiting their bedroom in the mornings because I\u2019m blocked in is a very common occurance in our home, becasue she refuses to leave her keys in a common area. In this specific situation, I didn\u2019t have the ability to grab her keys without making my brother get out of bed, which is what they\u2019re pissed about.", "I mean. he wouldn't have had to do that if the door hadn't been locked. like if this is an established thing yall do then it's kind of silly to get mad at a situation they could have avoided with a teeny bit of forethought", "Or if she would just leave her keys in a common area like both my brother and I do.", "we use key hooks in our multi-car household, and everyone's is labeled. would something like that help for yall? or maybe even putting a key receptacle specifically for her keys outside their door, if she doesn't want to mix them for whatever reason?", "We have a drawer near the garage we keep all the various keys in, including car keys. She just refuses to use it, and keeps them in their room.", "NTA. Especially after your edit that includes that she could have parked behind his car. They caused this problem and they\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get up at 5.", "Common sense says the couple should park one behind the other rather than block the singleton in. Clearly they have none. NTA.", "The last edit clinched it.  they purposefully blocked YOU in.  They could have blocked him in\n\nYou were kind and bought food as an apology for waking them.\n\nMaybe next time, they won't block YOU in.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nhow can they be so mean when you were so nice to them? You ever got them brekkie even though it was their fault you had to knock on their door. Bunch of meanies", "NTA.  The girlfriend (who does *NOT* own the home) may have learned a lesson to park behind your brother or leave the keys out or both.  In truth, your brother should have established this early on with any visitors.  The good news is that you have 2 more breakfast burritos in the frig, and you enjoyed a hangover-free, beautiful morning!  Cheers.", "NTA. If they don\u2019t want you to wake them up she either doesn\u2019t block your car again. Or she leaves her keys outside the bedroom where you can get them without waking them up.", "NTA\n\nTell them next time you wont wake them up. Just will get her car towed", "NTA. They blocked your car. You couldn't leave without waking them. Did they really expect you to just sit on your ass at home until they felt like getting out of bed? Maybe next time they'll park on the street, where they won't be preventing anyone from using their car.", "nta but i don\u2019t see the roommate situation between you and your brother getting better unless y\u2019all have a real sit down talk and lay out some boundaries", "NTA.. they are and anyone siding with them are idiots. They still got plenty of rest if they got home at midnight and u woke them up at 7. And if u did Door Dash they wld complain about that as well.", "I wouldn\u2019t go that far. Simply leaving the keys in a common area would be fine.", "Me neither lol\n\nBut mentioning that would make them think how stupid their logic is", "NTA poor burritos \ud83c\udf2f only want to make people happy", "NTA. Look at the bright side. You got to keep their burritos for lunch and dinner. \n\nThe GF didn't want to block your brother in. That would be just plain inconsiderate. (\u25d4\\_\u25d4)\n\nMuch ado about nothing. They got to roll over and go back to sleep. She had no right to block you in and maybe your brother should keep his extra set of keys where you can access them in case of emergency.", "NTA. I was thinking maybe a little ESH because you didn\u2019t HAVE to get a breakfast burrito. You could have been nice and let them sleep. But the fact that she parked behind you when she could have parked behind him changes it to NTA for sure.", "NTA... they blocked you in when the could easily have avoided it.

NTA.", "I had one for lunch, and gave my parents the other one. No burritos shall die on my watch haha", "What? Don't block someone in if you don't want to move your car. Even if it's the brother's house, the guest is still allowed to leave whenever.", "Idk about that even, block someone's car in and expect to be asked to move it - at whatever time. \n\nIn some ways it worse if OP is a guest, they're then just trapped in a house thats not theirs, no food or drink of their own...", "And free breakfast which they suggested I throw in the trash", "Yes, this. Every time I\u2019ve lived at a place where someone could get parked in, we always had a hook on the wall in a common space where the parker-inner could hang their car keys in case the parked-in needed to go somewhere.", "Bless u my child \ud83d\ude0a", "Then yeah, NTA, and I hope they learn not to block you in.", "NTA hopefully they will learn not to block you in next time.", "NTA. If they didn\u2019t want to be woken up then they shouldn\u2019t of blocked a car in that wasn\u2019t part of the coupling.", "NTA. As others have already pointed out, if you block somebody in, leave your keys in a general area.", "NTA. They should have parked in the street or left keys out in the open if they didn\u2019t want to be bothered with having to move it. She knew she parked behind you.", "NTA- Next time have the car towed and when they realize what happened remind them that waking them was rude!! You earned another breakfast burrito OP.", "INFO: How long have your brother & his gf been together?\n\nI'm kinda wondering if she's constantly blocking your car in as an attempt to get you to move out so she can have the whole house to herself & get your brother to marry her.\n\nI'm still gonna say NTA, her constantly doing this to you is beyond ridiculous.\n\n And I'm petty enough that if I were you, I would start parking my car just far enough in so that she cannot park behind my car!", "NTA", "I mean obviously the only correct answer here was to have their car towed instead, right?     /s", "We\u2019ve lived together our entire lives. Our relationship is as iron clad as can be. This is just a bicker thing where I feel like I\u2019m being bullied, and I\u2019m not the type to stand for that"]}
