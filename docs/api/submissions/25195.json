Put the collar on and low and behold a week or so later and its gone.......things where seeming strange and we had made the assumption he had found a second home.\n\nFast forward to yesterday and im trying to track him down for his annual vets appointment, found him in a bush and im trying to coax him out when all of a sudden one of my neighbours gets out her car and approaches me and asks if im his owner, i tell her i am, she then proceeds to tell me how good it is to put a face to his owner and that she has been letting him in her house and feeding him for ages!!! Obviously all i want to do is knock a b***h out.....i dismiss her and carry on trying to get him in the cat carrier as im running down the clock to his appointment.\n\nIm fuming because i have been throwing away id say 80 percent of his cat food for months now, i never see him, and im almost certain she removed his collar, she had also named him \ud83d\ude11 so my plan is to put a new collar on him with a galaxy tag, wait for the collar to go missing again and then track it to see if its in her house, if it is i will knock on her door and confront her and when she denys it i will set the alarm off on the tag to prove shes as dumb as she looks, wibta?\n\nEdit - this is in England.

Yes, it is very very very debatable if a cat should be let outside to freeroam. But, also, it is common knowledge and practice that in England/Scotland where I lived for 5,5 years - you don\u2019t take in a Roaming cat, let alone feed it or collar it or such. For many reasons, but to start with - you don\u2019t know the pet\u2019s potential allergies or such, and you can discourage it from going back home. And you don\u2019t just take in a cat if you don\u2019t know the owner, unless it\u2019s very very very clearly a streetcat and not a roaming one. \n\nThis is just standard common knowledge if you\u2019re from the UK.

OP is paying for cat food, the microchip, the vet and everything. It's their cat. Not the neighbour's. This woman even took out his collar??? \n\nThough I wouldn't play the collar trick.

There are barely any cat predators in the UK, and almost residential areas are pretty safe for them. \n\nMost people are not reading that after the plastic collar is removed OP does get a fresh collar and the neighbour taking the new one off makes them the asshole. \nClearly they knew the cat was owned by someone else- why didn\u2019t they ask? If you see a cat that looks well looked after, (ie no signs of malnutrition on the body- not just begging for treats) the usual etiquette would be to (1) not feed the cat and (2) put up \u201cfound\u201d posters around the area to see whose cat it was or (3) go to the vet and read the microchip to find the owner. \n\nHaving said that\u2026 cats do often \u201cchoose\u201d their owners.

It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s trying to abduct your cat, but rather take care of *what she previously thought* was a stray. YTA if this is the truth. Put a good collar on it, get it chipped, give it a great life, and move on.", "NTA. I\u2019m expecting downvotes for this \u201ccopy/paste\u201d because countries do things differently and some countries don\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d outdoor cats\u2026 However. I\u2019ve just found out OP is from England in comments so this is even more relevant.\n\n\u201cJust like people, cats are all individuals. Some cats love going outside, some barely put a paw through the cat flap and others can\u2019t go out at all, so wherever your cat spends their time, make sure they\u2019re safe and happy. This guide will help you consider what is best for your feline companion and suggest ways to ensure they enjoy a good quality of life in their home environment. \n\nPlease see Cats Protection\u2019s Essential Guide:\nFeral cats for more guidance on feral cats.\n\nRegardless of whether your cat lives indoors only or has access to outdoors too, Cats Protection recommends that your cat is microchipped, neutered, vaccinated and provided with flea and worming treatment. You can speak to your vet for more information and guidance about your specific cat\u2019s needs.\n\nThe great outdoors\n\nIdeally all cats would be allowed access to outdoors to express their natural behaviour and in the UK, the majority of people let their cats go outside. However, in built-up areas, there can be a large number of cats, each with a dwindling territory size and many people are choosing to keep their cats inside. In addition, it is recommended that some cats are kept indoors for their own benefit. Cats have a natural tendency to explore so allowing them access to the outside world gives them mental stimulation and reduces stress. If they are kept solely indoors, some additional considerations for their home are recommended.\u201d\n\nThis is literally from a cat protection charity in the UK and in the UK and many places in Europe it is absolutely normal and recommended to let your cat go outside. Some places don\u2019t recommend it - there are many countries that do so if you are basing your \u201cYTA\u201d opinion on what is done in your country? You aren\u2019t thinking about how things are done or what is recommended in others.\n\nOP, I would honestly encourage you to go ahead with your plan.", "I had a similar situation with my happy and healthy outdoor UK cat. As a UK cat owner you are NTA and you\u2019re very patient with all these crazy replies wishing ill to your cat. Ignore the downvotes to your comments. It\u2019s just because there are more people in the US than the UK and a significant number of them seem to think the US is actually the world and what they say goes, everywhere. A cat is MUCH happier when it can spend time outdoors ;)", "NTA - the comments talking about letting the cat out seem to generally be from different countries and it is perfectly normal in the UK and elsewhere to let cats out.  That is your decision to make based on the risks in your area i.e roads etc. Plus the Y T A judgements are not even based on what you asked. \n\nI would definitely talk to the neighbour about it. For all she knows the cat could be on a special diet and she could be risking the health of the cat plus it's rude to feed and put a collar on someone's cat. There is no indication from her response that she thought the cat was a stray and if she did she should have got the chip scanned. You could try the tracker option too.", "NTA, you chipped the cat, it should say that he is yours. One of the things that should be done if someone isn\u2019t sure about who that cat belongs to is to go and see if the cat is chipped.", "The comments are are mostly American who just can\u2019t understand that not everyone on this sit is form their country. As a fellow Brit I say NTA, outdoor cats are very common and this woman is basically stealing your cat. Definitely get a tag in her and give a talk to this women as well.", "NTA - go ask about this in r/cats for a more helpful/less reactionary response.", "I\u2019m saying YWNBTA. I\u2019m from the US, and my cats love to be outside and I wish I could let them, but the outdoor, unattended cat population aren\u2019t fixed because irresponsible owners just oh so want a kitten without the commitment of taking care of a cat, so the population explodes to the point people will shoot cats, and they spread diseases because they aren\u2019t properly vaccinated. So my kitties who want out are stuck solely indoors for their protection even though they\u2019ve been out before in a different area and will go out then come home. \u201cCats kill for pleasure and breed quickly with no one taking care of them\u201d. Yeah, so do humans, and here we are.", "I am not judging based on you having an outdoor cat. If I felt safer in my neighborhood I would too.\n\nBut cat culture or not, you have to accept the risks. They can get stuck in trees, hit by cars, attacked by wildlife or other pets, poisoned by household chemicals, or adopted by neighbors. \n\nWhen I was little we'd see one of our cats sunbathing in a neighbor's window. He'd come and go between us as he pleased. That was a part of the independence we accepted when we allowed him out.", "YTA\n\n\u201c Obviously all i want to do is knock a b***h out\u201d\n\n... For feeding and sheltering a wandering cat?\n\nYeah, my sister\u2019s cat convinced a neighbor up the street he was a stray.  Because he removed every collar type we put on him.  Know what we did when we found out she was feeding him bits of steak and cuddling him on the regular?  We reassured her he had a home and his choice of beds at night and during the day and told her she was welcome to cuddle him if he came to visit her again.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want your cat to decide to spend time with someone else and eat their food, don\u2019t let him wander.", "Can\u2019t understand all these y-t-a responses. Having an outdoor cat is very common and there are good reasons not to have a collar on them, which OP stated. \nClearly NTA OP. Occasionally feeding a random cat is understandable. Regularly doing it is not okay. Putting a collar on a pet that isn\u2019t yours is akin to theft", "I\u2019m sorry I have an outdoor guy who we rescued as a stray and I live in the US. Same thing here, he hates his collar and he is chipped. I would also be upset. It\u2019s not the cats fault and as people are saying chips aren\u2019t identifiable so I\u2019m inclined to say NSH. She knows he\u2019s your cat now so she should stop taking him in her home. Maybe limit his outdoor time and watch him more closely. That\u2019s what we do. And we make him wear his collar. He is insistent on going out. If he doesn\u2019t get to a little bit he cries non stop and will claw us and bite us. We also think he\u2019s a little mentally special. I think not everyone loves an outdoor cat but others also don\u2019t know how hard it can be to keep certain cats indoors always. I feel for your situation I really get where you are coming from.  Best of luck.", "Your neighbour is stealing your cat\n\nNTA", "YWNBTA .. if you live somewhere that still accepts the concept of outdoor cats.\n\nNot every place does.", "NTA except you should have told her that immediately.

I can\u2019t even fathom letting my cat roam free for multiple days at a time. \n\nAlso, with absolutely no collar or visible identification, why did you expect? He currently looks up for grabs so yeah, someone might take him. It\u2019s happened to a neighbor already because they also let their cat roam without a collar and the cat never came home one day.

This is a very very bizarre plan. You want to literally knock this woman out because she was feeding your cat?

I have three cats and they are all indoor.", "YWBTA because you don't care enough about your cat to let it be outside yet you care that someone else has been feeding him?

He could have been run over by a car. You didn't care. You care he's being fed?  You have no idea what goes on in your cat's life when it leaves your home. You have no leg to stand on berating people for feeding your cat.   \n\n\nAlso, your chip implant and collar irritation story doesn't add up. My dog and cat are both chipped. If there's an irritation, that means there's an issue. The answer isn't to leave your cat collarless (quick release, as you mentioned, works just fine). If there's an issue with the implant, go to the vet to figure it out.   \n\n\nYou chose to let your cat be an outdoor cat and you can live with the consequences. If you're so concerned, then it should be an indoor cat.   \n\n\nI have a cat and all the unknowns of being outside and the illnesses that can come from interacting with other cats, the wildlife killed, potential injury or death of the cat, eating poison by accident etc means there's no way in hell my cat is allowed outside except on a leash.", "My gawd, everyone not used to having outdoor cats it seems.

There was a period of time I let my cat be an indoor/outdoor cat, and he was constantly losing his collar. I figured he was biting/clawing it to loosen it and take it off, because he's a mischievous little boy. so I begrudgingly bought him a dog collar that doesn't break away. I got a call the next day saying someone helped free my boy from a chain link fence that he was stuck to. I took my boy home and immediately threw out the collar. So at the least, good on you for keeping him in the breakaway even if inconvenient. \n\nAlso, please note that my cat was ONLY outdoor because I had a roommate who constantly left her in-room back door open as well as her bedroom door. I eventually gave in and decided to try it, since there was also a cat door in the kitchen. There were so many problems with it and I realized I wasn't being a responsible owner.

Obviously all i want to do is knock a b***h out.....i dismiss her and carry on trying to get him in the cat carrier as im running down the clock to his appointment.\n\nIm fuming because i have been throwing away id say 80 percent of his cat food for months now, i never see him, and im almost certain she removed his collar, she had also named him \ud83d\ude11 so my plan is to put a new collar on him with a galaxy tag, wait for the collar to go missing again and then track it to see if its in her house, if it is i will knock on her door and confront her and when she denys it i will set the alarm off on the tag to prove shes as dumb as she looks, wibta?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
