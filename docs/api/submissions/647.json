He sounds like the kind of person who assumes she'll \"forget\" because of her disability.\n\nCan you let your grandparents or other family know? What he's doing, including the \"jokes,\" is unbelievably cruel.", "NTA - your dad is abusing his daughter, get help\n\nPerhaps you can find a relative to help you set up a nice birthday party for you sister.. She will be happy! And don't invite your father", "NTA. You are a fantastic sibling for caring so much. Is there any way you could throw her a party? Even if it isn't extravagant.

Ugh, what a mean thing for your father to do.", "NTA at all, something is seriously wrong with your father OP.", "YOU are NTA, but your dad sure is.     What a horrible thing for him to do.    I would be getting in touch with an adult, maybe an aunt, uncle, someone who knows him also and telling them what he is doing.", "NTA.

Way to stand up for your sibling.", "I don't know how soon her birthday is, but please reach out to me. I would love to help. I can order the decorations and have them shipped to you or a friend's house if u feel weird. I'll even have them shipped to a UPS hub. She should not have to suffer because of your father. And you should not carry this on your own. I know I am a stranger but I am a stranger who has a son with autism, I have a daughter as well. Please allow this stranger to help make your sister's birthday a memorable one. I wholeheartedly mean and stand by my offer. I'm sure a couple of us on this post could all come together and help, if not that's fine too. My offer still stands. Private msg me if you would like help. I would be happy to do so!", "Why is he like this with your sister?\n\nYou wouldn't be TA", "NTA but your dad is awful. Is your grandma someone who would be supportive if you told her what has been happening and your concerns? Are there other family members who could help?", "NTA but you may get further with your Dad if you sit him down and explain calmly why he needs to do this for your sister.   Ask him how you can help.  Maybe he needs a push, have some ideas ready so he knows you\u2019re serious.  You absolutely should not have to do this, but do it for your sister.", "NTA and hell no, hun... LAY INTO THAT MAN ASAP.
