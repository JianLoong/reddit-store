I personally love sardines. But you are working with other people in a shared space. It's theirs as well. Not everyone wants your sardines in their work air every day.", "NTA. This is hilarious though. \n\nPeople have to expect that the cafeteria or break room will smell like food. I would just try to wolf it down and not leave it uncovered whilst you eat the other items to limit the stench. That\u2019ll likely spare those around you with the exception of the couple of minutes it takes to scarf it down.", "NTA. As someone who is really sensitive to smells I do understand the co workers problem though. However, you are aloud to use the break room for your lunch just like anyone else is. \n\nBut to make it easier in your co worker I have suggestion. Do you eat the sardines directly out of the can and then trash it in the break room? This would keep the place smelling for quite a bit longer than your lunch. Maybe a small air tight lunchbox specifically for the sardines? And then you eat it either first or last and keep the lid closed as much as possible. \n\nHope this helps. And I do want to repeat, that even though I understand the co workers discomfort, you should not be forced to give up your lunch.", "NTA! People every single day eat different foods in lunch rooms. Ethnic foods are a great example. They're not for everyone. Furthermore, what smells great to me might stink like crazy to someone else. It doesn't mean I have to stop eating it when I am not the one with the problem. \n\nAdvice is go to HR and file a complaint beforehand. Tell them your reasons for eating the foods you are eating, and that you're being threatened and harassed by the coworker. We don't get to dictate what another person eats because the smell offends us. Your coworker has as many options as you do, including some Vicks vapo rub on her lip. \n\nAnd congratulations on the weight loss. Dedication is everything. I lost 100 lbs just stripping caffeine, sugars, and grains from my diet. I basically lived on meat and potatoes, with fruits, veggies, nuts, etc. I splurged occasionally and had chocolate or a glass of sweet tea. I had type two diabetes starting and that went away. I stopped having health issues and my energy levels skyrocketed. I don't know you, but I have high hopes for you. Good job and you've got this!", "YTA. Your prefered lunch is taking away the enjoyment from other workers during their lunch break. That's not fair to them.", "NTA\n\nNot sure your jurisdiction, nor am I going to asking. But the idea she can file a complaint about someone eating an admittedly pungent or fragrant food in the designated area is laughable. This is clearly a very entitled person. More likely than not, your work wouldn't be able or wouldn't care enough to do shit. \n\nAs for the social aspect, your biggest hit here would be relations with coworkers. As an introvert who seems to have a relatively good sense of humor about yourself, I can't imagine this is much of an issue. As long as you're okay with a few jokes about you and the smell, I can't imagine anything coming about here, nor should it", "NTA and happy you found something that works. The coworker is being petty. I get not liking the smell. I hate the smell of sardines and tuna. But I remove myself.

Does it go into a backpack? Locker? Does your breakroom have a sink so you can wash it out?\n\nJust a suggestion... there are really nice small glass containers with snap on lids that are better than plastic. They are easier to wash and don't absorb/retain food odors like plastic does. If your breakroom has a sink, then get a travel size squeeze bottle from Walmart and fill it with dish soap and throw that in with your lunch. \n\nI think you're NTA, and I feel like if you're making an effort to take care of your health and you demonstrate that you're conscientious of others around you, then HR won't do anything even if she does complain. \n\nUnfortunately, HR will probably ask you about your lunch if she does complain, so you'll just have to show them that you're doing your best to mitigate any lingering odors.", "NTA.

Plastic is porous, so by nature, smells will linger long after you finish your lunch, even if it's back in the fridge. People opening the fridge after you go back to work probably get hit with a whiff of your plastic container.\n\nAs far as the smell while you're eating them, just put the lid back on in between bites if you start eating something else, and wash out the container as soon as you finish them.", "I am autistic with a super sniffer. I can't handle the smell of sour cream. Anything with a slightly sour aroma in fact. It's what got me going on this. Ranch dressing is one of the most common foods to smell during lunch and it gets to me. Most dressing does. On that same note, I am obsessed with Mexican food. I grew up with people from Mexico, and the aromas do smell amazing to me. It was always a surprise to hear that the food stunk. All food has varying levels of aromas that can to some people be perceived as odors. I don't particularly like the smell of sardines, and my son eats them routinely, but I have smelled perfectly everyday American foods that people eat all of the time that stunk far worse.

To a certain extent it depends on culture, yes, but in general fermented food, meats tend to have noticeable more. I'm not saying who gets to decide, but you have to set the line somewhere, whether by consensus or scientific metric. Otherwise, I can bring surstr\u00f6mming, natto, durian, or boil a tonkotsu broth in the kitchen, all food items I absolutely love, in the cafeteria and I'm not sure you'd like that.", "No perhaps not, but we're talking sardines. Not an unusual food. It is also necessary food for OP's health. Not some novelty food item they're eating for pleasure. They're no more pungent than many other foods people bring to work.", "I\u2019m think it\u2019s common courtesy to eat foods that don\u2019t have strong smells. OP can sit outside.

People do a lot of offensive things. They have offensive odors we have to endure. Food is no different. Thankfully, unlike perfumes coworkers wear, the odor lasts until lunch break is over, and if you read OP's responses they state that walking to their car to sit is out of the question because they wouldn't have time to eat. \nNot everyone can eat the types of foods we find commonly in a lunch room.

I would certainly not want to deal with that while working.", "NTA, but I've worked in places where policies existed regarding highly potent smelling foods not being allowed (i.e. fish, popcorn, etc.) You might want to consider some alternatives to rotate the sardines with to avoid having enough people complain that it comes to that.", "YTA because it\u2019s *every day* and you\u2019re planning to continue eating the same every day going forward.

But unfortunately, you do have to consider other people in a shared space that you're all trapped in. I think you should compromise because sardines really do smell strongly and the smell lingers.

Can you take your lunch at an off time to try to avoid people as much as possible?\n\nI want to say your coworkers need to stop being babies and suck it up, but I once had a partner who made a sardine breakfast every morning and that stench stuck around and was deeply unpleasant. Try to consider their perspective \u2014 a rank odor every day at lunch. I think you should consider alternatives or be prepared for everyone to be your enemy. Everyone has to put up with smells they don't like periodically, that's life. But condemning them to that daily, indefinitely, at work, a place that already sucks, is not great.

I'd suggest replacing with something like chicken (thighs are better), similarly easy prep, marinated or cooked in whatever you like and no innate smell the way sardines have.  Plus from a health perspective sardines aren't actually all that great.  High in all sorts of vitamins? Yes, but also crazy bad for your cholesterol with all the sodium.  Better take fish oil at breakfast to get the benefits and swap to something else for lunch.", "Soft YTA. Smelly food in the office is inconsiderate. Smelly food every single day is rude.

You have the right to do it, but it makes you TA.", "Suggestion: can you add some sauce or cream to the sardines? If you could coat them with something like tomatoe sauce or something creamy it would reduce the smell a lot, because the sauce would serve as a barrier between the stinky skin of the sardine and the air. You can look for healthy sauces that wouldn't impact negatively on your diet. \n\nLike most say, is a mix, nobody can tell you what to eat or not, but eating stinky food every day in the office is quite offensive to the rest of the ppl eating there. Maybe this could be a good compromise.", "YTA. This is why I prefer working from home. Smells like this really bother me and I would hate sitting in the break room because of this. I would find something else to eat for lunch and eat the sardines later at home.", "YTA - you need to find office appropriate food.

You have a right to eat what you wish and it is understandable that your co workers don\u2019t want to smell fish everyday.

Or maybe try to swap the sardines out for something else a couple of days a week? Is there something you can do to mitigate the smell, like start a fresh pot of coffee or brew cinnamon tea during lunchtime?", "NTA, you're having them cold that's akin to having a refrigerated tuna sandwich. There are so many smells that various foods produce but people seem to have a mental fixation that anything fish based is not okay.", "NTA. It\u2019s your works prescribed eating space and you\u2019re eating there. Other people\u2019s displeasure with those smells doesn\u2019t get to dictate your diet. That said, you have to balance being \u201ctechnically right\u201d with the work place relationships and culture. You can be right and also offend folks.

I hate the smell of all kinds of things, but that's just working in a shared space. I find cold boiled eggs to be a disgusting smell, but don't expect people to abstain from such a common protein.\n\nI worked one place where someone regularly microwaved suspect fish in a small room. We all just held our nose and laughed. Even though that guy was a jerk! It's about being an adult.", "If your co-workers complain to your boss about the sardines, perhaps they could suggest some back room where you could happily eat them?", "NTA I\u2019d still plot your murder if I had to sit next to you, it wouldn\u2019t be personal.", "Look. I used to work in a place where a bunch of the office was always doing keto or similar nonsense.

It sounds like the coworker was confrontational and inflammatory in their approach to you. That\u2019s unacceptable in the work place. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to smell sardines and eggs every day though. You should be considerate that you are making a communal space unpleasant to others. \n\nPersonally I think you should bring HR into the fold so that the coworkers aggression toward you is documented, and HR can help mediate a compromise so you don\u2019t give up your favored foods while the coworkers are also respected.", "NAH, but I can see how uncomfortable it is for your coworker. Boiled eggs with sardines is a deadly combination. Could you switch your diet and eat sardines with boiled eggs for breakfast or dinner? You could keep bringing the vegetables and something else that's cheap and healthy. Like sourdough bread sandwiches or porridge. Can you open windows to remove the smell or eat elsewhere? \n\nI don't think you have to switch your diet, but it would be nice to do something about the smell.", "NAH - you\u2019re allowed to have your (very stinky) lunch, and they are allowed to take issue with the same (very stinky) smell EVERY. DAY. And it lingers. \n\nBut. I say this as a fellow fat person trying to make healthier choices - there are other things you can do. Tuna smells less. You can add vinegar to sardines to lessen the smell. Canned chicken - a little avocado or olive oil, toss with some herbs? Glorious. Oatmeal with berries is a great lunch - good fiber, a hit of sweet. You can even mix granola with nuts and dried fruit with yogurt for a healthy meal. \n\nI\u2019m proud of you for finding something that suits your palette and needs, but you do not exist solely in that meal plan bubble. I know it\u2019s hard when you find something that Works and Tastes Good - there\u2019s that fear that deviating will make to stop. That you\u2019ll slide back. It\u2019s a terrifying fear especially when you\u2019ve made such progress. \n\nBut you exist in a society, in a shared space.

Go talk to the boss first.  They could probably help you come to a compromise.  Being introverted doesn't mean that you can't get ahead of the problem.

And it's not sustainable, on a long time period, to eat the same thing every day.\nThe least you can do is to choose between sardines OR eggs and to add something like lentils or chickpeas (you can even seasoned it with pepper and red wine vinegar).

Unless you're warming it in a microwave, it's not that bad.", "It's not that you are the asshole but you are being inconsiderate.  When I managed an office there was a rule.  NO FISH ALLOWED.  The smell to others is gross and it lingers.  Eggs are another tricky one.  If you peel them at home and eat them quickly they might be OK. Save the sardines for home. Try to find another option.  Can you cook a number of chicken breasts so they are ready to go for lunches?", "I have a coworker that always eats stinky food for lunch. It\u2019s not a nice smell at all but everyone just laughs about it. YTA, your coworkers sound petty.", "NAH but there is an easy solution to your issue. The meal you have is probably better than how you used to eat, but it still isn't super balanced eating to just have the same six foods every day. We get the most out of a variety of nutritious foods, including different forms of protein. If you can come up with a few more meals for your repertoire, you can boost your nutritional intake and also compromise with your office mates by not having the sardines every day.

I do have to empathize a bit with your coworker though, it's one thing if a coworker sometimes brings something that smells absolutely nauseating to you, it's another thing entirely if its the same thing every single day.

A place I worked (factory) had a sign in the breakrooms outlining the types of fish allowed.  It had a big red X on all but one, it was the Swedish gummy fish.  Get it?  Fish stinks, the smell lingers and it's not polite to make everyone suffer.  You say you're getting healthy and that's amazing!  With summer approaching, it'll suck to walk out to your car and back but maybe that extra time moving will help?  I don't know what your exercise routine is but maybe this could be a part of it?  \n\n\nOH!  What else do you eat in your day?  Is there a way you can swap meals?  Maybe have this for breakfast and put something else in this place?  \n\nI'm super-proud of you for working on you!  Don't let this get you down, but maybe consider cutting out the salts?

They were pricier than what I typically buy, so that might be prohibitive.", "Very soft yta. Sardines reek. I\u2019ve got sensory issues and the smell of certain things like sardines ect make me want to die. Like actually choke myself then and there. But even a person who doesn\u2019t like sardines will tell you they smell like shit. My friends have compared them to a dead rat.

We had to tell them the truth, that Jimmy was shitting us out of the office on the daily. They asked him to use the bathroom at the coffee shop next door or go home is he is feeling that 'ill'. Anyone else would have probably just shit out in the factory bathrooms where the smell would be covered up by the various factory odors...but he thought it was too 'dirty' for him.", "Lemon juice can help too.", "Yep, this is the answer!", "Sardines AND eggs.  That smell would help me with my weight loss attempts because it would turn me off food altogether. I'm with you on the judgement, but yikes. There's no easy answer here.", "I wish there was an outdoor bench or picnic table that op could go to.  I find most break rooms tiny and any smells just travel.  eating in the car just sucks.

It makes op look more proactive in trying to be considerate of others,  but also they can still eat what they want.", "My coworkers rarely shower, I can't eat with the smell of unwashed ass wafting around....so grab lunch bring a camping chair, and eat literally anywhere I can't smell them.", "They make a spray called ozium spray that is kind of like a scentless febreeze - it works really well imo. Maybe OP could try that?\n\nNAH, and there are no easy answers.", "NAH for the same exact reasons.\n\nIt is fucking HARD to lose weight, and still enjoy what you are eating.  It makes it a bazillion times easier.\n\nSardines (and to a lesser extent, herring&tuna) stink.  Oy. I think OP is doing well with tossing the can at home, so no trash to make it hang around all day. I was going to suggest that, but he already does that. Maybe a different lunchtime?\n\nIn the past, I worked with it a very multi-cultural downtown office, and honestly...the lunchroom always reeks.  There are so many other dishes that the smell lingers longer than cold sardines.  Boiled eggs barely smell in comparison.\n\nI think you (meaning OP) are doing all in your power to cut down on the smell, and still keep to your weight loss goals.  I would continue to search for other options/lunch combos in the meantime. As much as I feel for coworkers about the smell, overall, i think your health is more important & to stay on track. I feel like the coworkers haven't experience kimchi in the lunchroom before. lol. Burnt popcorn lingers longer than sardines. And has the added pleasure of smelling \\*every time someone uses that microwave the entire day. \n\nAs an obese person who has lost 100+pounds in the past, it is the little things like some dumbass stinky ass lunch that keeps one motivated.  It is fucking HARD. I, too, need to have what I call \"high feedback\" (high sensory) foods to keep me on track.  So herring, pickles/olives, things with Franks Hot Sauce (it isn't even my favorite hot sauce, but it fills that sensory input). Other things are sauerkraut for the tang, and coleslaw for crunch. Also, vinegar soaked cucumbers&onions with celery seed & salt. mmmmm", "OP should see if he can take a later lunchtime than his coworkers - that way they wouldn't have to smell it when they eat.  I had a coworker who was on a fish diet once - but she heated it up, so there was microwave fish smell.

[Edit]: I see from other comments OP says he opens the can at home and eats them cold from a tupperware. Which is fair, but if it's strong enough that other colleagues are complaining then I do agree with the above post that it's an AH thing to keep eating them every single day without considering any kind of compromise.\n\nWe had a problem in a workplace that I worked at once where someone was eating canned mussels for lunch, and the break room would smell absolutely vile for the rest of the day afterward.\n\nIt turned out that even though they \"cleaned\" the can, all that really amounted to was rinsing it out with hot water, then tossing it into the rubbish bin, where the now-warm fishy oil kind of mingled with the other trash and made an absolute war crime.\n\nManagement didn't forbid them from eating mussels, but they were like - if you eat them, you can't wash out the can in the shared sink, you have to wrap it in paper towels then put it in a ziplock bag, and take to dispose of in the outside trash cans, or take it home.\n\nAfter that started happening, it was much less awful. You could still smell a bit of fishiness if you sat right near them at lunch time, but it didn't fill the break room for the rest of the day.", "Yes sardines and boiled eggs (marinated so not freshly boiled...), that's quite pungent alright.
