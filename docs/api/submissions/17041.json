Hypertension (on three medications, all max dose), GERD (on a medication), sleep apnea (use CPAP every night), erectile dysfunction (which arguably sucks more than anything else).  Last time I had routine bloodwork was over a year ago, and my cholesterol was above \"normal\" but not high enough to need medication.  My blood sugar was okay, thank god.  But I'm due for more bloodwork soon, so hopefully that's still the case.\n\nAnyway, I've been trying to eat healthier, and after a lot of trial and error, I've settled on the following lunch:\n\n- One can of sardines\n- Two soft-boiled eggs (marinated in soy sauce, mirin, and sake...also known as ajitsuke tamago)\n- Three 0.75-ounce pieces of Cabot Seriously Sharp cheddar cheese\n- 20 grape tomatoes\n- Three mini cucumbers (sliced and seasoned with Tajin)\n- 20 black grapes\n\nThis lunch has struck the perfect balance of: 1) relatively cheap (the cheese is more expensive than I'd like, but everything else is reasonable), 2) relatively easy/fast to prepare (the eggs can be a pain to peel and have to be marinated for 24 hours, but everything else can be prepared pretty quickly in the morning), 3) tasty (I legitimately enjoy eating all six of these foods and haven't gotten tired of them yet), and 4) healthy (it's a very nutritious, balanced mix of foods).\n\nI've been doing this for a few weeks and have lost about 10 pounds.  The problem is that some of my coworkers dislike the smell of the sardines in the breakroom.  Today one of them finally confronted me about it and said that I \"need to stop eating those around other people.\"  I said that sardines are a normal food and that I have just as much of a right to eat my lunch in the breakroom as anyone else.  She said that if I bring them again next week, then she's going to \"file a formal complaint\" with my boss.\n\nHonestly I'm not willing to give up my sardines, nor do I feel like I should have to.  They're a bonafide wonder food.  In addition to being a strong source of healthy protein and omega-3s, they're also a wonderful source of vitamins and minerals, including things that can be lacking in other foods like calcium and vitamin D.  And since they're at the bottom of the food chain, you can eat them every day without having to worry about mercury poisoning like with tuna.  And they taste great to boot.\n\nSo my question is: AITA if I ignore her demands and continue to eat sardines in the breakroom?\n\nP.S.: Some people might ask why I don't just go to my car to eat.  I would actually prefer that option even if this whole fiasco hadn't occurred because I'm very introverted, but unfortunately our building and parking lot are both massive, so I'd end up spending half of my break walking back and forth and wouldn't have time to eat, especially since I like to savor my food.

I personally love sardines. But you are working with other people in a shared space. It's theirs as well. Not everyone wants your sardines in their work air every day.", "NTA. This is hilarious though. \n\nPeople have to expect that the cafeteria or break room will smell like food.

That\u2019ll likely spare those around you with the exception of the couple of minutes it takes to scarf it down.", "NTA. As someone who is really sensitive to smells I do understand the co workers problem though. However, you are aloud to use the break room for your lunch just like anyone else is. \n\nBut to make it easier in your co worker I have suggestion. Do you eat the sardines directly out of the can and then trash it in the break room? This would keep the place smelling for quite a bit longer than your lunch. Maybe a small air tight lunchbox specifically for the sardines? And then you eat it either first or last and keep the lid closed as much as possible. \n\nHope this helps. And I do want to repeat, that even though I understand the co workers discomfort, you should not be forced to give up your lunch.", "NTA! People every single day eat different foods in lunch rooms. Ethnic foods are a great example. They're not for everyone. Furthermore, what smells great to me might stink like crazy to someone else. It doesn't mean I have to stop eating it when I am not the one with the problem. \n\nAdvice is go to HR and file a complaint beforehand. Tell them your reasons for eating the foods you are eating, and that you're being threatened and harassed by the coworker. We don't get to dictate what another person eats because the smell offends us. Your coworker has as many options as you do, including some Vicks vapo rub on her lip. \n\nAnd congratulations on the weight loss. Dedication is everything. I lost 100 lbs just stripping caffeine, sugars, and grains from my diet. I basically lived on meat and potatoes, with fruits, veggies, nuts, etc. I splurged occasionally and had chocolate or a glass of sweet tea. I had type two diabetes starting and that went away. I stopped having health issues and my energy levels skyrocketed. I don't know you, but I have high hopes for you. Good job and you've got this!", "YTA. Your prefered lunch is taking away the enjoyment from other workers during their lunch break. That's not fair to them.", "NTA\n\nNot sure your jurisdiction, nor am I going to asking. But the idea she can file a complaint about someone eating an admittedly pungent or fragrant food in the designated area is laughable. This is clearly a very entitled person. More likely than not, your work wouldn't be able or wouldn't care enough to do shit. \n\nAs for the social aspect, your biggest hit here would be relations with coworkers. As an introvert who seems to have a relatively good sense of humor about yourself, I can't imagine this is much of an issue. As long as you're okay with a few jokes about you and the smell, I can't imagine anything coming about here, nor should it", "NTA and happy you found something that works. The coworker is being petty. I get not liking the smell. I hate the smell of sardines and tuna. But I remove myself. When coworkers I'd normally have lunch with brought in tuna, they understood that I was ditching them because of the smell.

Does it go into a backpack? Locker?

They are easier to wash and don't absorb/retain food odors like plastic does.

People opening the fridge after you go back to work probably get hit with a whiff of your plastic container.\n\nAs far as the smell while you're eating them, just put the lid back on in between bites if you start eating something else, and wash out the container as soon as you finish them.", "I am autistic with a super sniffer. I can't handle the smell of sour cream. Anything with a slightly sour aroma in fact. It's what got me going on this. Ranch dressing is one of the most common foods to smell during lunch and it gets to me. Most dressing does. On that same note, I am obsessed with Mexican food. I grew up with people from Mexico, and the aromas do smell amazing to me. It was always a surprise to hear that the food stunk. All food has varying levels of aromas that can to some people be perceived as odors. I don't particularly like the smell of sardines, and my son eats them routinely, but I have smelled perfectly everyday American foods that people eat all of the time that stunk far worse.

To a certain extent it depends on culture, yes, but in general fermented food, meats tend to have noticeable more.

People do a lot of offensive things. They have offensive odors we have to endure. Food is no different. Thankfully, unlike perfumes coworkers wear, the odor lasts until lunch break is over, and if you read OP's responses they state that walking to their car to sit is out of the question because they wouldn't have time to eat. \nNot everyone can eat the types of foods we find commonly in a lunch room.

I would certainly not want to deal with that while working.", "NTA, but I've worked in places where policies existed regarding highly potent smelling foods not being allowed (i.e. fish, popcorn, etc.) You might want to consider some alternatives to rotate the sardines with to avoid having enough people complain that it comes to that.", "YTA because it\u2019s *every day* and you\u2019re planning to continue eating the same every day going forward.

But unfortunately, you do have to consider other people in a shared space that you're all trapped in. I think you should compromise because sardines really do smell strongly and the smell lingers.

Can you take your lunch at an off time to try to avoid people as much as possible?\n\nI want to say your coworkers need to stop being babies and suck it up, but I once had a partner who made a sardine breakfast every morning and that stench stuck around and was deeply unpleasant. Try to consider their perspective \u2014 a rank odor every day at lunch. I think you should consider alternatives or be prepared for everyone to be your enemy. Everyone has to put up with smells they don't like periodically, that's life. But condemning them to that daily, indefinitely, at work, a place that already sucks, is not great.

I'd suggest replacing with something like chicken (thighs are better), similarly easy prep, marinated or cooked in whatever you like and no innate smell the way sardines have.  Plus from a health perspective sardines aren't actually all that great.  High in all sorts of vitamins? Yes, but also crazy bad for your cholesterol with all the sodium.  Better take fish oil at breakfast to get the benefits and swap to something else for lunch.", "Soft YTA. Smelly food in the office is inconsiderate. Smelly food every single day is rude.

You have the right to do it, but it makes you TA.", "Suggestion: can you add some sauce or cream to the sardines? If you could coat them with something like tomatoe sauce or something creamy it would reduce the smell a lot, because the sauce would serve as a barrier between the stinky skin of the sardine and the air. You can look for healthy sauces that wouldn't impact negatively on your diet. \n\nLike most say, is a mix, nobody can tell you what to eat or not, but eating stinky food every day in the office is quite offensive to the rest of the ppl eating there.

Some people say it stinks or is too spicy or whatever, but it fills me up and helps me stay healthy both nutrition wise and weight wise.
