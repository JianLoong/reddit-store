Hypertension (on three medications, all max dose), GERD (on a medication), sleep apnea (use CPAP every night), erectile dysfunction (which arguably sucks more than anything else).  Last time I had routine bloodwork was over a year ago, and my cholesterol was above \"normal\" but not high enough to need medication.  My blood sugar was okay, thank god.  But I'm due for more bloodwork soon, so hopefully that's still the case.\n\nAnyway, I've been trying to eat healthier, and after a lot of trial and error, I've settled on the following lunch:\n\n- One can of sardines\n- Two soft-boiled eggs (marinated in soy sauce, mirin, and sake...also known as ajitsuke tamago)\n- Three 0.75-ounce pieces of Cabot Seriously Sharp cheddar cheese\n- 20 grape tomatoes\n- Three mini cucumbers (sliced and seasoned with Tajin)\n- 20 black grapes\n\nThis lunch has struck the perfect balance of: 1) relatively cheap (the cheese is more expensive than I'd like, but everything else is reasonable), 2) relatively easy/fast to prepare (the eggs can be a pain to peel and have to be marinated for 24 hours, but everything else can be prepared pretty quickly in the morning), 3) tasty (I legitimately enjoy eating all six of these foods and haven't gotten tired of them yet), and 4) healthy (it's a very nutritious, balanced mix of foods).\n\nI've been doing this for a few weeks and have lost about 10 pounds.  The problem is that some of my coworkers dislike the smell of the sardines in the breakroom.  Today one of them finally confronted me about it and said that I \"need to stop eating those around other people.\"  I said that sardines are a normal food and that I have just as much of a right to eat my lunch in the breakroom as anyone else.  She said that if I bring them again next week, then she's going to \"file a formal complaint\" with my boss.\n\nHonestly I'm not willing to give up my sardines, nor do I feel like I should have to.  They're a bonafide wonder food.  In addition to being a strong source of healthy protein and omega-3s, they're also a wonderful source of vitamins and minerals, including things that can be lacking in other foods like calcium and vitamin D.  And since they're at the bottom of the food chain, you can eat them every day without having to worry about mercury poisoning like with tuna.  And they taste great to boot.\n\nSo my question is: AITA if I ignore her demands and continue to eat sardines in the breakroom?\n\nP.S.: Some people might ask why I don't just go to my car to eat.  I would actually prefer that option even if this whole fiasco hadn't occurred because I'm very introverted, but unfortunately our building and parking lot are both massive, so I'd end up spending half of my break walking back and forth and wouldn't have time to eat, especially since I like to savor my food.

It is tucked in the back corner of a room, but the room is close to a high traffic area.  People were complaining about the smell so much that management was concerned that an animal had crawled up in the wall and died.  And started tearing down drywall.  I don't know if they figured out that it was his shit ass lunch, but they moved him to a different building away from management.  \n\n\nI really like sardines, but I'd never eat them around other people.

I don't like the smell of sardines. \n\nIf you were eating them on a plane, I'd say YTA, but somehow I can't get all the way there on this one. Your NTA, but you really are kind of a jerk. You eat sardines in the shared break room *every day*?  It's your right to do so, but it is a little inconsiderate,  imo.

Like, no Surstr\u00f6mming or Durian. I think sardines is really on the fringes so it's hard to judge. One thing I noticed is that a lot of people fucking hate sardines and think they're disgusting, while having no issue with tuna cans which I think smell just as much. There's probably ways to make the smell less noticeable like putting them into a separate tray from the cans before work (I feel like the moment of opening the cans emits most smell).", "Info: are you microwaving the sardines?", "Why sardines?

If you are then anyone who dislikes the smell can sit across the room from you, it doesn't go that far.\n\nIf you're microwaving them the entire break room will smell terrible, for some reason microwaved fish stinks, so a complaint would be valid.", "Use a different fish. I personally love sardines. But you are working with other people in a shared space. It's theirs as well. Not everyone wants your sardines in their work air every day.", "NTA. This is hilarious though. \n\nPeople have to expect that the cafeteria or break room will smell like food. I would just try to wolf it down and not leave it uncovered whilst you eat the other items to limit the stench. That\u2019ll likely spare those around you with the exception of the couple of minutes it takes to scarf it down.", "NTA. As someone who is really sensitive to smells I do understand the co workers problem though. However, you are aloud to use the break room for your lunch just like anyone else is. \n\nBut to make it easier in your co worker I have suggestion. Do you eat the sardines directly out of the can and then trash it in the break room? This would keep the place smelling for quite a bit longer than your lunch. Maybe a small air tight lunchbox specifically for the sardines? And then you eat it either first or last and keep the lid closed as much as possible. \n\nHope this helps. And I do want to repeat, that even though I understand the co workers discomfort, you should not be forced to give up your lunch.", "NTA! People every single day eat different foods in lunch rooms. Ethnic foods are a great example. They're not for everyone. Furthermore, what smells great to me might stink like crazy to someone else. It doesn't mean I have to stop eating it when I am not the one with the problem. \n\nAdvice is go to HR and file a complaint beforehand. Tell them your reasons for eating the foods you are eating, and that you're being threatened and harassed by the coworker. We don't get to dictate what another person eats because the smell offends us. Your coworker has as many options as you do, including some Vicks vapo rub on her lip. \n\nAnd congratulations on the weight loss. Dedication is everything. I lost 100 lbs just stripping caffeine, sugars, and grains from my diet. I basically lived on meat and potatoes, with fruits, veggies, nuts, etc. I splurged occasionally and had chocolate or a glass of sweet tea. I had type two diabetes starting and that went away. I stopped having health issues and my energy levels skyrocketed. I don't know you, but I have high hopes for you. Good job and you've got this!", "YTA. Your prefered lunch is taking away the enjoyment from other workers during their lunch break. That's not fair to them.", "NTA\n\nNot sure your jurisdiction, nor am I going to asking. But the idea she can file a complaint about someone eating an admittedly pungent or fragrant food in the designated area is laughable. This is clearly a very entitled person. More likely than not, your work wouldn't be able or wouldn't care enough to do shit. \n\nAs for the social aspect, your biggest hit here would be relations with coworkers. As an introvert who seems to have a relatively good sense of humor about yourself, I can't imagine this is much of an issue. As long as you're okay with a few jokes about you and the smell, I can't imagine anything coming about here, nor should it", "NTA and happy you found something that works. The coworker is being petty. I get not liking the smell. I hate the smell of sardines and tuna. But I remove myself. When coworkers I'd normally have lunch with brought in tuna, they understood that I was ditching them because of the smell. And it never caused ill feelings.", "NTA, unless there's some part of the story missing, it sounds like you're just minding your own business and eating your food. What kinds of food do other people bring/eat that have no smell?", "NTA", "NTA. There are a lot of food smells other people might not like. Your lunch should not be dictated by someone else, and frankly anyone who threatens to file a complaint over someone\u2019s lunch does not deserve to be rewarded for that behaviour by getting what they want. Beat her to the punch and file a complaint about her harassing you.", "NTA - eat what you like, they need to regulate their emotions .", "Personally I think NTA as I don\u2019t think sardines smell any different than any other fish. Where I\u2019m from sardines come in a can with a tomato sauce. So you mainly smell tomatoes. Is it the same where you\u2019re from?", "NTA.\n\nDifferent foods smell bad or good to different people. I love the smell of curry but A LOT of people complain about that smell. I eat oysters out of the can and my husband thinks it\u2019s absolutely disgusting. At the same time he will eat pickled herring. **gags**\n\nEat your food and congratulations on your weight loss!", "NTA.  Congrats on the weight loss and finding something that works for you!  Your co-worker is being ridiculous, as I'm sure HR will tell her.  If there is anything you can do to mitigate the smell, and you feel like doing to keep the peace, then by all means do it.  But, if not, then just be stinky and keep losing weight :)", "NTA. I was waiting for you to say you were microwaving them or something, which would have been a \u201cno\u201d but just out of the can?  Are they packed in oil? If yes, maybe you can switch to water packed? Also I would say to toss the can outside trash or thoroughly wash it out, but beyond that you should be allowed to eat lunch in peace.", "NTA. If co-worker takes issue with sardines what about fragrant foods from other cultures...?", "NTA.   \nFile a complaint now, before she does.\n\nStay strong.", "Between the sardines and the boiled eggs it feels like you went out if your way to find the worst foods to bring into an office. It's like lunch time biological warfare. That being said no one can stop you, but I would hate to be in your coworker. Have you tried the packets of tuna. The smell may not be as bad as sardines. NAH", ">smell of the sardines in the breakroom\n\nYou are eating in a prescribed area.  The break room is exactly where food smells should be - even sardines.  Being mad that the break room smells like food is like being mad the rest room smells like poop.  You shouldnt have to inconvenience yourself by eating in the car.  Continue eating what you please in the break room.  \n\nId call your coworkers on their bluff and invite them to go make their *formal complaint*.  Im sure there is a microwave in the break room that smells up the area every time someone uses it.  NTA", "This is tough. I've started to have kippers occasionally for my lunches BUT only on the weekends for precisely this reason. \n\nMoreover, there is \"am I technically the asshole?\" and then there is \"am I going to damage relationships at the office and if so what are the possible ramifications of that?,\" which is probably the more important question. \n\nI'm going to vote NAH.", "NTA", "INFO: I read through your other comments to see that you bring them in a Tupperware type container... my question is what do you do with the container afterwards? Does it go into a backpack? Locker? Does your breakroom have a sink so you can wash it out?\n\nJust a suggestion... there are really nice small glass containers with snap on lids that are better than plastic. They are easier to wash and don't absorb/retain food odors like plastic does. If your breakroom has a sink, then get a travel size squeeze bottle from Walmart and fill it with dish soap and throw that in with your lunch. \n\nI think you're NTA, and I feel like if you're making an effort to take care of your health and you demonstrate that you're conscientious of others around you, then HR won't do anything even if she does complain. \n\nUnfortunately, HR will probably ask you about your lunch if she does complain, so you'll just have to show them that you're doing your best to mitigate any lingering odors.", "NTA. Well done on the weight loss and for doing something positive and recognising that you need to. I would bring this up with HR first, not as a complaint but in terms of asking for assistance on how to resolve the issue.", "This is the same as someone bringing in their cultures food that doesn\u2019t particularly smell good like I will always bring whatever my grandmother makes me to school even if it smells like real bad NTA", "INFO have you talked to your doctor about this diet?\n\nSmelly fish is often a no no in close quarters. Have you considered trying another sardines brand? Maybe one kept in oil instead of tomato?", "If you work with someone from India though, and they bring in their ethnic food, do you get to allow your offense to be their problem? If you eat ham and a coworker who is Muslim is offended by it being in the same room, do they get to threaten you with a complaint because of it? We have to be tolerant.", "No, I open the can at home (because it's difficult to do without the oil splattering) and put them in a Tupperware-like container.  Then I keep them in the fridge until lunch and eat them cold.", "I open the can at home (because it's difficult to do without the oil splattering) and put them in a Tupperware-like container. Then I keep them in the fridge until lunch and eat them cold.", "Thank you!", "A lot of people just bring basic stuff like sandwiches or those little trays of frozen pasta that you heat up in the microwave.  There are a couple of other fat guys who eat pure junk (like I've literally seen one of them eat eight Reese's cups and a Dr. Pepper for lunch).  And then of course there's the requisite group of skinny women who just eat salads.  The woman in my OP is one of them, and sometimes I wonder if she's just being mean to me because I'm so fat, but I know it's not healthy to think like that.\n\nBut yeah, most of my coworkers eat \"normal\" foods with benign smells.  But I really don't think there's anything wrong with sardines.  More people would probably like them if they actually tried them.", "I bring the eggs and cucumbers in the same type of container (the cheese, tomatoes, and grapes are in Ziploc bags), so I just put all three containers back into the fridge after lunch and then grab them at the end of the day so I can take them home for the dishwasher.  Do you think the glass containers would help in that case?  The smell seems to bother them primarily when I'm actively eating the sardines; I can't smell them when the container is in the fridge.", "I do think there's degrees. I have had several desi colleagues who had ethnic but not overly flagrant food. On the other hand there's some people who have extremely strong smelling food, it's not black and white and it's like a general attitude of trying to show respect to those around.", "Ham doesn't smell", "NTA.", "Then they're fine. I sometimes eat sardines at work, only people right next to me notice the smell. If someone microwaves fish everyone knows about it, so it's polite not do do that but cold, canned fish is normal for people to eat for lunch.", "Nah, you're absolutely fine. Continue eating your sardines and good luck on your weight loss journey. If i were in your position and the co-worker had been nice about it, I may have considered finding a replacement for the sardines but she's being rude about it, so screw her.", "Let's just say the plastic containers don't help the problem and glass does help. Plastic is porous, so by nature, smells will linger long after you finish your lunch, even if it's back in the fridge. People opening the fridge after you go back to work probably get hit with a whiff of your plastic container.\n\nAs far as the smell while you're eating them, just put the lid back on in between bites if you start eating something else, and wash out the container as soon as you finish them.", "I am autistic with a super sniffer. I can't handle the smell of sour cream. Anything with a slightly sour aroma in fact. It's what got me going on this. Ranch dressing is one of the most common foods to smell during lunch and it gets to me. Most dressing does. On that same note, I am obsessed with Mexican food. I grew up with people from Mexico, and the aromas do smell amazing to me. It was always a surprise to hear that the food stunk. All food has varying levels of aromas that can to some people be perceived as odors. I don't particularly like the smell of sardines, and my son eats them routinely, but I have smelled perfectly everyday American foods that people eat all of the time that stunk far worse. Philly cheese steak sandwiches for example make me gag. So it's just a question of which foods cross a line and who gets to make that call?", "Ham does smell, obviously not nearly as much as sardines.", "exactly.  it doesnt light up the room/office at least \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA: Perhaps you should start microwaving them...", "It's not only about whether the aroma is pleasant or not but how pervasive and concentrated it is. To a certain extent it depends on culture, yes, but in general fermented food, meats tend to have noticeable more. I'm not saying who gets to decide, but you have to set the line somewhere, whether by consensus or scientific metric. Otherwise, I can bring surstr\u00f6mming, natto, durian, or boil a tonkotsu broth in the kitchen, all food items I absolutely love, in the cafeteria and I'm not sure you'd like that.", "No perhaps not, but we're talking sardines. Not an unusual food. It is also necessary food for OP's health. Not some novelty food item they're eating for pleasure. They're no more pungent than many other foods people bring to work.", "I\u2019m think it\u2019s common courtesy to eat foods that don\u2019t have strong smells. OP can sit outside. I don\u2019t think a lunch room should stink if anything. Sandwiches, cupasoup, reheated leftovers that aren\u2019t egg, oily fish, or spicy aromatic foods", "Okay. So all odoriferous foods are out because it might offend someone? What about deodorant, perfumes, floral smelling body washes, potent laundry detergent, Windex for cleaning? So all offensive odors are off limits? What kind of world works like that? Why should someone have to change their diet that is helping them to suit their coworkers? People do a lot of offensive things. They have offensive odors we have to endure. Food is no different. Thankfully, unlike perfumes coworkers wear, the odor lasts until lunch break is over, and if you read OP's responses they state that walking to their car to sit is out of the question because they wouldn't have time to eat. \nNot everyone can eat the types of foods we find commonly in a lunch room. Tolerance is tolerance. It doesn't only exist for people who conform to the standard practices."]}
