But by the time I was six, my mom had started dating my dad's former best friend. I'll admit, I was a shit to my mom and by the time I was seven, she stopped seeing me after her wedding because she and my stepdad were moving back to Malaysia. I didn't see my mom at all after that. She would call me all the time but I didn't see her.\n\nWhen I was 15, they moved back here because my stepdad wanted their kids to have a Canadian education. So, the first thing that my mom did was reconnect with me. It has been great having her back and we've gotten so close again.\n\nThe thing is, she still acts like she has something to make up for. She still goes all out. At my graduation, she and my stepdad bought me a Honda Accord. At my birthday they got me a PS5 last year and a new Xbox this year. They've already given me cheques for four years of tuition. And they even cancelled their vacation for the summer because I'm taking a summer semester and it'd be unfair to go if I can't go.\n\nI don't need them to do any of that but my mom just doesn't get it. When I tried to tell her that yesterday, she just said she could never forgive herself for abandoning me and I got mad and told her to stop saying that because it's not true. She just screamed at me that I'd never understand because I'd forgotten what she put me through and I can't tell her how to love. My stepdad was like give her time and she'll come around but was I an asshole to say that?", "created_utc": 1673635766, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b26dw/aita_for_telling_my_mom_to_stop_saying_that_she/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would suggest to just try to communicate with her again and eventually she will understand, hopefully.", "Nta, but you do need therapy with your mom, because she doesn't seem to understand that you don't hate her. But at the same time, this kind of behavior is not uncommon with parents who for some reason or other (even legitimate ones like mental health, or occupation) are not able to be with their child.", "NAH. Y\u2019all have different feelings about that time and that\u2019s okay. You were also very young at the start of this so might not have the entire picture of the situation that she does so maybe try to be understanding about how she feels about the situation", "NAH she can't help the way she feels, just try to be kind to her, hopefully she'll start to feel less guilty, maybe she needs therapy", "NTA. \n\nYou're trying to demonstrate to your mom that it's water under the bridge and that you've forgiven it. It will take longer for her to forgive herself. \n\nBe gentle with her, maybe recommend some family counselling.", "NTA. Your mother is trying to make this about herself, one is tempted to say: Again. But ... In the meantime, enjoy your consoles and other material benefits. Don't let them go to your head, and hope your mother will relax at some point, so that the two of you can have an adult conversation about what happened and what needs or doesn't need to happen. I think your stepdad might have the right understanding here.", "NTA. It sounds like you're running out of patience. It is REALLY hard letting go of mom-guilt. Maybe sit down with her and tell her calmly that you appreciate all she's trying to do, but you don't feel it's necessary, you don't hold a grudge against her, and you appreciate the relationship you now have. I'd also suggest she get some therapy, but lots of people don't like hearing that.", "NAH. She feels a lot of guilt about not being there. I think it's actually important that you tell her your side, that it wasn't all that she sees it as. It is going to take a lot of work for her to not live  inside this guilt. But you're 100% NTA for telling her she doesn't have to carry that guilt.", "NTA. I can tell she\u2019s not mad at you for saying that but still very frustrated with herself and what she \u201cput you through\u201d. So frustrated with herself that she doesn\u2019t even believe you. I suggest you guys go to therapy together to work this out cause it\u2019s causing problems", "NTA. Or more actually accurately NAH.\n\nYou're allowed to feel your feelings. And yours are that she didn't abandon you. \n\nBut; she's allowed to feel her feelings too, and she feels she did. \n\nIt's important that she knows you don't see it that way, and if she says \"you were too young to remember \" then tell her \"Exactly.\" YOU don't see it that way because you were young, and a lot of that went beyond you. So FOR YOU, she's far beyond made up for it because she's back in your life, and you guys are tight. \n\nTry not to let your feelings get the better of you though, because I'll tell you this; as a mom, if it were me, I'd struggle too. That's HEAVY for a parent, and as condescending as this always sounds, in this case it's very true, you can't understand the depths she feels until/ unless you have a child. \n\nI'd maybe sit her down, and suggest you two talk all this out with a mediating force (preferably a therapist so they can guide the discussion.) Tell her you not only want to try to understand her side better, but you also want the both of you to be able to move forward without that weight. Can't hurt <3 Best of luck!", "NTA \n\nYou are so so so NTA. There are so many raw animal emotions that go into being a parent and especially being a mother. \n\nI know you have rationalised it brilliantly and that you are being such a good person for reconnecting with her now.\n\nThe problem is that it's really really out of the ordinary for a child to lose its mother at a young age. You have permission to be very angry about that if you want to be. \n\nI have no idea about the circumstances of the divorce and so I can't say how much of it was your mother's decision, but your mother went through a lot of adult emotions and it's kind of normal to feel very emotional about it. \n\nI'd really strongly recommend talking it through with a therapist on your own or with her as this is quite complicated shit.", "NAH. Much as you don't see it as something to make up for, she as your mother left you and you two missed a lot of years together. Telling her to stop won't work, because her guilt needs an outlet, and letting her do it her way won't work because it's suffocating to you. But you're both just trying to deal and move on as well as you can. \n\nMaybe try, instead of telling her to stop, giving her 'pre approved' actions? Like, \"you can make it up to me by attending my graduation, meeting my partner, add other life events here\". Clearly, what you want is to have her involved moving forward, so telling her that that's her chance to 'make up for' previous distance might help you both. \n\nAnd even take time to share what ye missed: schedule lunches or days together dedicated to looking through old photo albums or taking a walk around some places you spent time so you can share stories of what happened in your life. Double benefit there of helping to bridge any distance from the separation, and it gives her a task to 'pay' against her perceived debt (dedicate that time to something wholly about you) so she can feel like she's making up for it.", "NAH\n\nBut, think of it. You saw the situation as, you were angry with your mom and you didn't want to see her, so her moving didn't negatively affect you, and on the contrary it gave you the space and time to forgive her and build a new relationship later.\n\nShe went to another country, leaving her hurt, upset 7yo child behind. She missed seeing her child grow into a teen. So yes from anyone's point of view but yours, what she did counts as abandoning. \n\nIt's okay that you don't feel that way, and you can ask to tone down all the attention, but you should at least understand where it comes from.", "I want to lean towards NTA, but i suspect that your mother has felt that she abandoned you for years and that sentiment might've taken root and grown to a tall Oak in her mind.\n\nI think perhaps a longer talk with her about this might be in order, for as long as you can keep from being angry or loud during this talk.\n\nWomen and their maternal instincts etc is not something we men can quite fathom, but for as long as you feel that you weren't abandoned, you should be allowed to atleast say so, for as long as you're not trying to force your viewpoint to become hers.\n\nAlso, you might wanna talk to your stepdad about whether your mother was fussing over you when they lived abroad to get a view from someone who was there with her those years.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is unloading her personal guilt and trauma onto you. SHE feels like she abandoned you, even if you didn't absorb it as that experience.\n\nYou're also 18 now, and can decide to decline their gifts if you choose.", "YTA.  Yes, she abandoned you.  Her reasons may have been legitimate, but she left you, and she feels guilty for it.  You can do all you can to mitigate the guilt, but she has legitimate feelings of guilt; give her time to work through them.  If her accommodations for you feel over the top, tell her that.  Keep telling her until she works through her emotions, but quit screaming at her - she deserves respect for owning up to the fact that she was absent from your life and feeling bad about it.", "NAH she did abandon you and she needs you to acknowledge it and reassure her to help her grieve what she's lost. It's a bit crazy but what you resist, will persist. \n\nYour step dad is right, please give her time and accept the gifts as it's helping her process. You can always re-gift or sell the ones you don't want. Keep spending quality time with her and make happy memories going forward, she'll settle down sooner.", "NAH. I understand why you're uncomfortable, but... I mean, you're right to tell her that you don't see it that way, but I say if she wants to do all that stuff for you because it makes her feel better, let her.\n\nNow, if you're uncomfortable with it for other reasons... Like, if you feel like she's being manipulative, or she's making you feel like you owe her something... That's different. I think some amount of discomfort on your part is ok; sometimes we make sacrifices for other people like that. But yeah, I know there are complex social forces at work when it comes to gifts.", "I\u2019m sorry but your mom did abandon you. She left you to live in other county with her new man/ husband. You should have been her priority. I \u2018m happy to read you are close and good now. NTA because you are allowed to feel how you feel. Mom is-the A hole for leaving you and not visiting for you for years.", "NTA but maybe offer to do some family therapy with your mom and encourage her to get individual therapy.  She did abandon you, but I think it is very big of you to not hold that against her and still want to form a relationship.  She is very fortunate to have you as a child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You told her she was doing too much. She disagreed.", "NTA. It was going to be NAH until your mother screamed at you, because it sounds like she's trying hard to compensate for what (she at least feels) was a massive failure of you, but she's also putting her desire to do that over your own feelings about it and that makes her TA. I hope she can calm down and talk to you calmly about it.", " NAH\n\nWe get so many stories of family drama here. We never hear about reconciliation or change or forgiveness. But sometimes that happens. You are not an arsehole, but accept the good fortune of a happy ending graciously.", "The answer is clear.  Milk it for all it's worth until she stops feeling guilty!  \n\nDrop hints.  Be like \"You know I've always wanted to travel to Europe for a nice two week vacation but sadly, I can't afford it.\"  Then walk around with puppy dog eyes.\n\nI'm just kidding.  NTA.  It sounds like you're at your wits end.  Sometimes you have to be firm for someone to listen.  But it'll turn out ok.  You seem like a good dude and your mom clearly loves you so this will blow over.", "NAH. So many stories on Reddit have the parent and child saying very different things. Give it time and things will settle down.", "NAH I dont think abandon is the the right work since you were still in contact the whole time and she obviously wanted to still be involved in your life. It sounds like she wants to make up for the time she wasnt physically with you but throwing money and gifts at you is the wrong way to go about it.", "NTA. She did abandon you though. Like, moving out of the country during your core childhood years is abandoning you, theres no other way to look at it. I think you need to acknowledge that but forgive her. That will help her move on more than pretending it didn't happen.", "NTA. This might be how she is. She may never forgive her self even if you have. and if she continues to throw gold bricks at you \ud83d\ude02. Maybe start donating items or money to worthy causes. She buys you a new system donate it or your old one to a children\u2019s hospital. She give you cash you donate it.", "We have reconciled though. We do so many things together that don't involve her throwing gold bars at my face (that's a bad metaphor but you get it).", "My mom is never going to therapy. She would probably die before going.", "My mom would jump off a bridge before going to any kind of counselling.", "It has been three years. At what point is enough going to be enough? Calling me 'her precious baby' when she's got a four year old right there is weird enough without her showering me with money.", ">I'd also suggest she get some therapy, but lots of people don't like hearing that.\n\nI think she'd slap me if I said that.

That's HEAVY for a parent, and as condescending as this always sounds, in this case it's very true, you can't understand the depths she feels until/ unless you have a child.\n\nBut wouldn't it help you realize that you didn't abandon your kid if they explicitly told you so?", "And can't she see that my point of view is what matters?

I know she loves me, I don't need a fucking parade.", "No, she's not being manipulative in like she makes me feel like I owe her. But maybe she is in the way that she wants me to keep feeling she owes me, if that make sense.", "No, she didn't. Maybe if she never called, sent gifts for my birthday and stuff like that.

She was always available for me.", "The vacation they cancelled actually was visiting Europe...", "Not a bad metaphor haha, imo, I think she sees it as not being enough, because of all that time apart, I think your stepdad is right, giving more time for her to adjust, if not, I think therapy, like the others have suggested would be the next step", "Maybe tell her you forgive her for leaving you. Admit that you know you were difficult but that you\u2019ve grown out of that and habour no ill feelings towards her. Tell her you felt loved from afar. It may not be much but it may help assuage her guilt.", "You gotta remember, man, change takes time. You sound well adjusted, so just keep communicating and let your mom learn that she's enough - she'll get there.", "Maybe tell her she can make it up to you by having a weekly lunch date with you. Something that doesn't cost a lot of money but allows her to feel she is actively working to make up for the past. Maybe also suggest family counseling.", "She is carrying a lot of guilt.  I would think therapy could help.  You may have forgiven and forgotten, but she hasn\u2019t.", "Is she religious? Maybe speaking with a pastoral counselor would be more her speed. \n\nBut, even so, maybe YOU should goto therapy. I saw somewhere that if you feel someone else would benefit from therapy with you, it means there's also changes that you see within yourself that need to happen and going to therapy on your own can help facilitate that and help you change your relationship to your mother's attempts at making up for her lost mothering years.\n\nMaybe try to see things from her side and stop feeling guilt for accepting things from her. It's her life, her money, her choice what to do with it yknow?\n\nNAH", "May I ask if it's the culture stigma thing family business is family business or personal thing? For why she won't do counseling", "Yes. You might be precious, but baby ... No, I would object to that as well. She needs to control herself.", "It\u2019s sounds like you may be more self aware and developed than she is. And she has some serious self loathing that she has to work through. It\u2019s amazingly wonderful and compassionate of you to recognize the situation for what it was! \n\nHer sense of identify may be tied to being a bad mom; while it may seem illogical and counterintuitive to hold on to this, it can also be safe and secure and what she knows. Sometimes the fear of the unknown, in her case letting go of that identify, may mean a sense of feeling like she\u2019s losing you, especially at your milestone age of growing up. Moving forward can be really scary. Staying attached to this narrative enables her to be close to you and that time. \n\nI would discuss how you can have a new adult relationship. One that doesn\u2019t need things. Only you guys know what that looks like and how to best have those conversations. Perhaps if she sees how a new and beautiful relationship and attachment can be had, she can see the benefit in letting go of the old narrative; if she\u2019s self loathing, it\u2019s a narrative that plays into and confirms those beliefs. \n\nAgain, illogical to those who don\u2019t understand, but it makes perfect sense if that\u2019s the case. Any proclamations of how great she is may be rejected, bc she doesn\u2019t inherently believe them. You can\u2019t do that work for her, but you can certainly help her. You sound like a great child who loves their mom. \u2764\ufe0f Her getting mad or uncomfortable isn\u2019t a reflection of you, but of her own self doubt and self image.", "You can say you never felt abandoned. That's fine and she can be happy to hear it. But nothing about your feelings can change the fact that she was in another country for years. It's a fact. That's the literal meaning of \"not being there\". Yes she was on the phone. But she wasn't there in the mornings, when someone needed to cook breakfast. She wasn't there to buy groceries. She wasn't there to take you to the doctor or to the movie theater. She wasn't there to notice small things. And the list could go on for pages. Sure it could have been worse. It's good that you dealt with the situation so well. But the situation itself was less than ideal. She's human and she feels guilty. You can ask her to tone her behavior down, but not to tone down her feelings.", "I agree with you. Your mother is even making her \u201cabandonment\u201d about herself. She sounds selfish but also moral enough to know she is being selfish. Who is she to make YOU feel bad about how she feels bad for something SHE DID? Like what? That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying having her back in your life, and I hope you continue to do so. I also hope that she isn\u2019t as selfish as she sounds in your post, and that any time you two have any disagreement that leads to feelings getting hurt that it isn\u2019t solely about her.", "I don\u2019t know when you become a mom you are supposed to be there psychically in daily life until your child is a grown up. She didn\u2019t raise you, feed you , tuck you in at night. She left not for health reasons and was gone for years. A call is different then a real hug. Who was with you all those years? Who took care of you?", "I think you should strongly consider weaponizing this.\n\nIf you ask your mom for something, say a new shirt or video game or something, and she says no, just respond with \"Yeah I knew you'd say no.  You abandoned me so why would you buy me a shirt?\"\n\nI'm totally joking don't do that.", "I have told her all of that. It's just tough having he think that I don't love her.", "I don't know why she hates it, but we're not Christians, so it's not that.\n\nIf I go, I'd have to find a way to hide it from my family.", "If I had to guess, it's because she's Asian.", "Thank you, I've never thought about it like that before. I don't want her to think that she's a bad mom. She's the only one I have and she's always been great to me.", "My grandparents did all of that when she was gone but now that she's back, she's the one who does it. Sure, but it didn't make a difference to me that she did it by a call and when she came back, she did it all in person. Even though I'm 18 she'll still snuggle up to next to me, with me in one arm and one of my siblings in another.", "Keep reassuring her. Thank her for things like time spent together or activities you've done together. Lean on quality time over material things, which it sounds like you're already doing. It sounds like you're all good people trying to adjust to a less common situation.", "Again, you sound like an amazingly empathetic and considerate and thoughtful person. She\u2019s lucky to have a child capable of seeing and understanding her pain. Likewise, you\u2019re lucky to have a mom who cares so deeply. She may show it in funny ways, but you can be aware when that\u2019s happening and show her the grace that many parents aren\u2019t given from their adult children when they try to make amends for how they fell short all those years ago. Life\u2019s too short not to make amends if it\u2019s healthy and possible.", "Also, if she REALLY wants and needs to give gifts bc that\u2019s one of her love languages, create rules or limits. If you tell her things you really need and want it will prevent her buying unnecessary things and allow her to feel good, if that\u2019s what she needs to do, and it doesn\u2019t mean going into debt or spending funds that should be used for her own bills and expenses. Perhaps instead of a new expensive gift, it\u2019s a trip for just you two to bond and work on the core issues. Show her that you want experiences and time over things. Heck, a weekend somewhere fancy can still be a big gift!", "We fall into the habits and routines of the roles we know. With your high emotional intelligence, I wager you can be the one to help her see herself more accurately. Also, we lash out to the ones we love the most. It\u2019s where we feel safest. Doesn\u2019t make it okay, but it\u2019s helpful to understand sometimes confusing expressions of emotion.", "One day you will become mother (if not that\u2019s also ok) but then you will understand what I\u2019m trying to say.

Why are you trying to get them to find trauma in something that wasn't/isn't traumatic for them? Why make a problem where there isn't one? Don't tell people that \"once you're a mother you'll understand...\" because not everyone that's a mother reacts to motherhood in the same way as other mothers.

Two of my own, two from my partner's first marriage, one we adopted.", "Would you leave them for years? Could you?

I still called and sent letters and packages, etc. She lives with us here now."]}
