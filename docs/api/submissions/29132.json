OP, you and your fiance should do what the two of you want. If you're feeling gracious, offer to let Grandma attend your marriage thing. Do not let anyone guilt you into doing something contrary to your own happiness.\n\nI was raised Catholic. Family, church, school, the whole nine yards. I wouldn't go back. The Catholic Church has got to be one of the most hypocritical religious organizations out there.\n\nYou are not Catholic. Grandma dying doesn't change that. If she can't understand that, she can take it up with God directly. Because a true Christian does not need to connect to God through some dude in a robe who insists on being called \"daddy\" like he ranks higher than the literal son of God.", "Here's the thing though, if grandma is that devout then a courthouse wedding isn't actually a wedding ad it is not recognized as such. To her it may simply not count and what you're suggesting to grandma is for her to join them at the courthouse and see them sign some meaningless papers.\n\nNot saying they shouldn't, in fact I think they should minimize the hassle for themselves, but for grandma your suggestion may be meaningless.", "Like the other person said, as someone that grew up Catholic but isn't anymore. \n\nThe Catholic church view on it all is that is a courthouse marriage isn't even a valid marriage. It's insane like that. If you get one this way, you need to go though a convalidation ceremony to have your marriage recognized as valid by the Catholic church.", "If they were confirmed as a teen (which they probably were) they are considered Catholic.\n\nThey would have to go through pre-Cana classes ( which include things like money and budgeting so does have some benefit).\n\nBut I say go with the Courthouse wedding.\n\nSource: Catholic, did Courthouse wedding, haven't confessed in 40+ years, still allowed to take Communion and teach CCD classes (albeit at a gay-friendly multi cultural left wing Catholic worker movement parish. Yes they do exist).\n\nNTA.", "Even if the priest is willing (and many would be) the diocese will not usually allow a wedding outside the church.\n\nHowever they could ask the hypothetical friendly family priest to attend the Courthouse wedding and give them a blessing for their future life (we had a priest that routinely did this for gay couples).", "Second this comment.

This was a generally illiterate society's way of doing things.\n\nWhen France had a war to separate church & state, and the church came back into power, couples had two marriage ceremonies - both a civil and religious one because the state didn't \"recognize\" the church ceremony & the church didn't accept the civil ceremony.\n\nBeing a historian is cool at times :)", "Funny after 43 years the church still thinks I\u2019m living in sin \ud83e\udd23", "Fair enough re: \u201cwon\u2019t allow\u201d, but it\u2019s kind like ok, what does that mean? that the vatican won\u2019t record it?

A person dresses in ritual garb, speaks specific words, performs specific actions, and they (and others who share their faith) believe that these actions and words have changed the nature of reality.

There are not only other religions that witches follow, but there are also secular witches who may engage in spellwork but not prayers or blessings. I'm mostly in that category. \n\nThat said, I'm well aware of the difference between the three concepts, and perhaps the sacrament of marriage itself doesn't meet the definition of a spell, but the most frequently practiced rite in Catholicism is communion. And with the belief in transubstantiation, that one absolutely does meet the criteria for being a spell, because it includes the critical aspect of believing that their actions have affected reality in some way.\n\nAnd again, I'm well aware that you haven't claimed other faiths have been less honest. Can you point me to where I said you did? And I really don't get why you think pointing out what I said is some kind of gotcha. I'm not playing tit for tat here, or \"I know you are but what am I\". I know what I said, that it was not a direct counter to anything you said, and I stand by it. Because I think Catholicism in particular - Christianity as a whole, to a degree, but especially Catholicism - routinely engages in practices that have all the requisite elements of spellwork, and I find it both funny and frustrating that they get so touchy about that being pointed out."]}
