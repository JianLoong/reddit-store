Tell Grandma you're taking her to lunch then go to the courthouse instead", "\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f This.\n\nA wedding isn't about anyone else but the two people agreeing to be together.  \n\nGrandma can have her bucket list, that doesn't mean she gets to demand anything.  And that is exactly what she's doing in the guise of a death wish.\n\nNTA.  Screw her.", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re using grandma, she also really wanted us to get married, I think they\u2019re just playing the cards they were given\u2026 it\u2019s still very suspicious", "Also, if she \\*breathes a word to anyone\\* she isn't coming.", "Ask grandma if a big religious wedding is more important to her than getting to see her granddaughter get married, because one is happening and one isn't, and she gets to decide if she attends, but that's all she can pick.", "Ask her if she\u2019s doing it for Jesus or the church. Two different things and no matter what Jesus will be there if she truly believes", "Well you can't. Neither of you is Catholic so that's not going to happen unless you plan to lie through the whole thing.", "Then don't take grandma. Everyone has to deal with disappointments in their lives, she can handle this one. Don't tell anyone just present it as a done deal.\n\nThis is your wedding, have the wedding you want, not what everyone else wants. It's not right, IMO, for you and your fiancee's wishes to be ignored. \n\nCongrats and best wishes for a happily ever after!\n\nETA.   NTA", "Can you tell grandma that it\u2019s impossible to do a religious or a big wedding? If you want to just do the religious you arrange to have just grandma at a church witnessing the wedding. No one else no fuss no muss \n\nSometimes you have to do what\u2019s best for you and even grandma has to understand that.", "There's a word you need to learn. Your post leads me to believe this word is new to you. That word is:\n\n\"No\"\n\nUse it early and often.", "Does grandma have a close relationship with her priest? (or any other Catholic clergyman who can administer a wedding sacrament) \n\nI\u2019m wondering if her personal robe dude would let you skip the seminar and just marry you in front of Grandma on some weekday afternoon. Probably especially worth trying if Grandma is so involved w her church that your fiance is known to robe dude. \n\nThat would get grandma \u201creligious\u201d but not \u201cbig\u201d. The second bit\u2014 the thing about weddings is they are a trump card to get the whole family in one place at the same time, de facto family reunion. Would it work to promise her the right to hold a \u201cwedding reception\u201d for you that you take no part in planning? Mom/gma can host where they like and invite who they like and wield the \u201cwedding\u201d card\u2014 hell if they feel it they can send engraved invitations! But you just point blank do not participate in planning it, ergo no fighting?\n\n\nedited to add: the last paragraph is basically how my aunt who is now a professor of biomedical engineering got married. She was in grad school at the time but my grandmother super wanted a big wedding because my aunt was her last kid to get married. Aunt was like \u201cI am NOT having a big wedding\u201d and in desperation my grandmother offered to plan the whole thing and everyone was very happy with the result.", "Can you ask a priest to come to the courthouse to say a few words?", "Well, then tell her at the courthouse that this is the wedding and if she doesn't want to see it, she can sit on a bench while it happens.", "Grandma is being a manipulative ass. Thyroid cancer sounds serious but is so super treatable. She'll die of old age before she dies of thyroid cancer.", "Just to be clear, for most types of thyroid cancer, including the most common ones, the 5 year survival rate is in the high 90s", "The most suspicious thing is the wedding being against the bride and groom wishes. For real it is supposed to celebrate both, not appease a religious grandma. \n\nIf you paid you have the final said on picking accordingly to your liking, others preference are irrelevant. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t the one paying. Then you can consider it as a all expense paid party. Doesn\u2019t revoke your right to consent participating or not.", "That\u2019s not how it works in Catholicism. They need the guy in special robes to say some spells in the idol repository.", "Exactly. The church isn\u2019t going to rubber-stamp your marriage if you aren\u2019t believers. When my parents got married (dad catholic mom Protestant) they could only get married at the front of the church not at the altar, and my mom had to agree to raise any children catholic. And they were both devout", "Unless it\u2019s a family friend this is unlikely to happen.", "Love that description."]}
