My husband is leaving a large portion of his estate to family, which I am very supportive of. As such, his will outlines that his family receives all this money from his estate. The problem is, that in Australia, the 401k he has is a primary part of his wealth and is by law left to the spouse not the estate. That means that to pay for all these gifts, it would have to come out of either selling our home, or me using my inheritance money to settle the gifts. My husband is comfortable with the will, and in me fulfilling his wishes by either me selling our home, or using my inheritance as his partner to settle the gifts. Either way, the gifts are going to be paid and the will is absolutely valid. \n\nTonight, an Uncle of my partner turns up from another state and starts explaining the above, stating that the family is at risk of not receiving the inheritance because of the will only including the estate - and emphasis here, by law the spouse is to receive the 401k (superannuation we call it here). The will specifies I receive anything left after the gifts. He asks me to sign a handwritten deed, stating that I will fund his family\u2019s gifts using the 401k money, or my own money. In other words, forcing my hand in paying them their gifts, if his estate doesn\u2019t cover it.\n\nI took great offence to this, and stated this is incredibly disrespectful and insulting, especially since my husband didn\u2019t ask for this, that he has very limited time and we\u2019re wasting it on political and legal issues, and most importantly, that you would question me as his husband in my ability to fulfill my dying husband\u2019s final wishes. \n\nI quickly broke into tears, and left the room and refuse to speak to the uncle. Before I left I said I will review the contract, but not before my lawyer reviews it. My husband was very sad when I left the room, and was mad at the uncle for doing this to me. \n\nI feel like this uncle is meddling in our affairs as husbands.

Half of the money in \"his estate\" is yours at the very least. You mention that you make more than him, so really whatever that percentage is yours and the remainder is what should be divided if appropriate. And even THAT shouldn't be given entirely to his family. Right now you are giving away YOUR estate too.", "NTA\n\nUncle IL is a an asshole for asking you to sign this.  And he's probably doing so because he realizes that your husband doesn't actually have an estate to leave (or, at least, not much of one).\n\nYour husband's superannuation can't be left to his siblings by law.  Unless he has other dependents who live with him, all of the death benefits for your husband's superannuation go to you.  So, those aren't part of his estate.\n\nDepending on how the house is titled and how your bank accounts are held, those may also go directly to you upon your husband's passing.  (For instance, here in the US, our house is titled \"joint with rights of survivorship\" which means if something happens to me, my husband becomes the sole owner of our house and our kids don't get any part of it.  Similarly with our bank account.)\n\nI understand your husband's desire to help his siblings.  And I applaud you for wanting to fulfill his wishes.  However, I would encourage you to meet with your own attorney and financial planner to determine how you could best meet your husband's desires after his passing without having to make any sudden decisions (such as selling the house) and in a manner that best helps his siblings (large lump sums may be wasted whereas regular gifts over time might be better).  It's possible that you could keep the house, keep some of the superannuation and give the siings gifts over time from your income.  This isn't necessarily something that you need to bother your husband about, but could be something you work out after his passing.\n\nBut absolutely don't sign anything unless your attorney says it's in your best interest to do so.  If Uncle wants to helps his siblings so much, he can give them his own money.\n\nAnd be careful with your ILs altogether.  If they start hassles mg you for money immediately, remember you don't have to give them anything that isn't legally required.  If they are bothering you, it may be best to keep the superannuation, house, and anything else legal in your own name and then determine one your own whether you wish to give gifts to fulfill your husband's intent.\n\nIn the meantime, please spend as much time with your husband.

My husband is leaving a large portion of his estate to family, which I am very supportive of. As such, his will outlines that his family receives all this money from his estate. The problem is, that in Australia, the 401k he has is a primary part of his wealth and is by law left to the spouse not the estate. That means that to pay for all these gifts, it would have to come out of either selling our home, or me using my inheritance money to settle the gifts.

My eldest uncle is very trustworthy and usually asked by grandpa to deal with his finances but the middle one is more inclined to be greedy and mooch and we all dreaded a potential fight.

It is kind of an asshole move to force you to sell your home or give away the 401(k) money because he wants to give them more than he actually has to give away.\n\nAnd the uncle is a grab a little thing, demanding that you sign basically a promissory note to give him money that he is not legally entitled to. \n\nYou are a NTA.

Shouldn't everyone pay their own flipping taxes? If the estate is so vast he should make each gift smaller and have the estate pay the taxes not you.

OP\u2019s spouse asks him to fund gifts that he wants to leave people as inheritance. The only way to fund these gifts is by liquidating assets, which OP *wants* to do for his spouse.\n\nIf OP\u2019s spouse has so much that the vultures are already circling, I don\u2019t think OP is worried about money after his husband is gone.", "That's not up to OP to decide though... His husband set the will and has decided where his things should go following his death. This situation is like asking for a prenup. Your partner might feel hurt or offended but that doesn't mean prenups shouldn't be a thing. OP needs to separate their feelings from the bureaucratic aspect of their partners will.", "Yes, the uncle is owed what the will stipulates (though other comments have clarified that the uncle isn't actually a beneficiary and was just sticking his nose into others' business). What I mean is that it is part of a will and not automatically required to go to anyone, i.e. a gift, and in the case of the 401k it is entirely at the discretion of the OP. Nobody has any right to be making demands of where this money goes *except* the OP and his husband. The uncle making demands about it makes him a jerk.\n\nI see how what I wrote could be misconstrued but that's what I was trying to say."]}
