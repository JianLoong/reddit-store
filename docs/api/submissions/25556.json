My husband is leaving a large portion of his estate to family, which I am very supportive of. As such, his will outlines that his family receives all this money from his estate. The problem is, that in Australia, the 401k he has is a primary part of his wealth and is by law left to the spouse not the estate. That means that to pay for all these gifts, it would have to come out of either selling our home, or me using my inheritance money to settle the gifts. My husband is comfortable with the will, and in me fulfilling his wishes by either me selling our home, or using my inheritance as his partner to settle the gifts. Either way, the gifts are going to be paid and the will is absolutely valid. \n\nTonight, an Uncle of my partner turns up from another state and starts explaining the above, stating that the family is at risk of not receiving the inheritance because of the will only including the estate - and emphasis here, by law the spouse is to receive the 401k (superannuation we call it here). The will specifies I receive anything left after the gifts. He asks me to sign a handwritten deed, stating that I will fund his family\u2019s gifts using the 401k money, or my own money. In other words, forcing my hand in paying them their gifts, if his estate doesn\u2019t cover it.\n\nI took great offence to this, and stated this is incredibly disrespectful and insulting, especially since my husband didn\u2019t ask for this, that he has very limited time and we\u2019re wasting it on political and legal issues, and most importantly, that you would question me as his husband in my ability to fulfill my dying husband\u2019s final wishes. \n\nI quickly broke into tears, and left the room and refuse to speak to the uncle. Before I left I said I will review the contract, but not before my lawyer reviews it. My husband was very sad when I left the room, and was mad at the uncle for doing this to me. \n\nI feel like this uncle is meddling in our affairs as husbands.

Half of the money in \"his estate\" is yours at the very least. You mention that you make more than him, so really whatever that percentage is yours and the remainder is what should be divided if appropriate. And even THAT shouldn't be given entirely to his family. Right now you are giving away YOUR estate too.", "NTA\n\nUncle IL is a an asshole for asking you to sign this.  And he's probably doing so because he realizes that your husband doesn't actually have an estate to leave (or, at least, not much of one).\n\nYour husband's superannuation can't be left to his siblings by law.  Unless he has other dependents who live with him, all of the death benefits for your husband's superannuation go to you.  So, those aren't part of his estate.\n\nDepending on how the house is titled and how your bank accounts are held, those may also go directly to you upon your husband's passing.  (For instance, here in the US, our house is titled \"joint with rights of survivorship\" which means if something happens to me, my husband becomes the sole owner of our house and our kids don't get any part of it.  Similarly with our bank account.)\n\nI understand your husband's desire to help his siblings.  And I applaud you for wanting to fulfill his wishes.  However, I would encourage you to meet with your own attorney and financial planner to determine how you could best meet your husband's desires after his passing without having to make any sudden decisions (such as selling the house) and in a manner that best helps his siblings (large lump sums may be wasted whereas regular gifts over time might be better).  It's possible that you could keep the house, keep some of the superannuation and give the siings gifts over time from your income.  This isn't necessarily something that you need to bother your husband about, but could be something you work out after his passing.\n\nBut absolutely don't sign anything unless your attorney says it's in your best interest to do so.  If Uncle wants to helps his siblings so much, he can give them his own money.\n\nAnd be careful with your ILs altogether.  If they start hassles mg you for money immediately, remember you don't have to give them anything that isn't legally required.  If they are bothering you, it may be best to keep the superannuation, house, and anything else legal in your own name and then determine one your own whether you wish to give gifts to fulfill your husband's intent.\n\nIn the meantime, please spend as much time with your husband.

NTA", "And husband has said he wishes for some of that money to go to his family\n\nThat\u2019s why the uncle came to OP to sign over the legal rights to it.\n\n\n>we started to develop his will with consultation of a lawyer in estate planning. My husband is leaving a large portion of his estate to family, which I am very supportive of. As such, his will outlines that his family receives all this money from his estate. The problem is, that in Australia, the 401k he has is a primary part of his wealth and is by law left to the spouse not the estate. That means that to pay for all these gifts, it would have to come out of either selling our home, or me using my inheritance money to settle the gifts. My husband is comfortable with the will, and in me fulfilling his wishes by either me selling our home, or using my inheritance as his partner to settle the gifts. Either way, the gifts are going to be paid and the will is absolutely valid.", "Which is true. \n\nI was thinking that technically the husband can will whatever they want - it doesn't mean it's necessarily possible. You can will $1,000,000 to your family, but if you don't have it, then what's anyone gonna do about it?\n\nUltimately, it's fine whatever OP decides, I think. Whether they give the rest of the family more from their own benefits or not, it sounds justified either way."]}
