{"id": 25556, "submission_id": "161yw57", "title": "AITA for saying no to signing a contract to use my dying husbands inheritance to pay for his family\u2019s inheritance?", "selftext": "My husband is terminally ill, and yesterday we were told that he has several weeks to live. \n\n I\u2019ve been my husband\u2019s primary carer since being diagnosed 8 months ago and have been doing everything to support him including sacrificing my work. \n\n A few months ago, we started to develop his will with consultation of a lawyer in estate planning. My husband is leaving a large portion of his estate to family, which I am very supportive of. As such, his will outlines that his family receives all this money from his estate. The problem is, that in Australia, the 401k he has is a primary part of his wealth and is by law left to the spouse not the estate. That means that to pay for all these gifts, it would have to come out of either selling our home, or me using my inheritance money to settle the gifts. My husband is comfortable with the will, and in me fulfilling his wishes by either me selling our home, or using my inheritance as his partner to settle the gifts. Either way, the gifts are going to be paid and the will is absolutely valid. \n\nTonight, an Uncle of my partner turns up from another state and starts explaining the above, stating that the family is at risk of not receiving the inheritance because of the will only including the estate - and emphasis here, by law the spouse is to receive the 401k (superannuation we call it here). The will specifies I receive anything left after the gifts. He asks me to sign a handwritten deed, stating that I will fund his family\u2019s gifts using the 401k money, or my own money. In other words, forcing my hand in paying them their gifts, if his estate doesn\u2019t cover it.\n\nI took great offence to this, and stated this is incredibly disrespectful and insulting, especially since my husband didn\u2019t ask for this, that he has very limited time and we\u2019re wasting it on political and legal issues, and most importantly, that you would question me as his husband in my ability to fulfill my dying husband\u2019s final wishes. \n\nI quickly broke into tears, and left the room and refuse to speak to the uncle. Before I left I said I will review the contract, but not before my lawyer reviews it. My husband was very sad when I left the room, and was mad at the uncle for doing this to me. \n\nI feel like this uncle is meddling in our affairs as husbands. He is trying to look out for his family, but in doing so, has shown to me the little trust he has in me as the man my husband picked all these years ago, married and am now losing. I have seen  this uncle a few times a year over the duration of our relationship. Of course I would fulfill my husband\u2019s wishes, and my whole life is him. I\u2019m shocked we would spend this time on semantics of how money is distributed, than to be present with my beautiful man in his final moments. \n\nAITA for not signing this handwritten deed?", "created_utc": 1693065389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161yw57/aita_for_saying_no_to_signing_a_contract_to_use/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure even your husband would agree.\n\nHowever I'm questioning why his family should get everything... even parts of the estate (the 401k) that are legally yours?  Does your husband really want you to be left with nothing?", "NTA AT ALL - is your husband really willing for you to lose your home when he dies!?! Ask him to either support the rest of your life, or find someone else to nurse him. If he says he wants you to lose your home as well as your husband, then book carers for him for a few days and take a well-deserved break. If he doesn\u2019t care about your life, then you are wasting your time caring for him now. \nOne thing to check is whether his uncle is putting undue pressure on him, when he is vulnerable. Is there anyone else from his family that you could check in with?", "You can make this very easy for the uncle. He gets NOTHING. What a selfish son of a birch. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You\u2019re being nicer than many people, willing to let go of your house to give them money. He\u2019s trying to take advantage of a sad circumstance.", "NTA, it\u2019s completely valid to acknowledge emotions are running high during such an intense moment", "Your husband kind of is the worst. His responsibility is to protect your financial future, not his family\u2019s. Making you have to give up your home or the 401k in which he made you the beneficiary is kind of rude and disrespectful to you. You sacrificed for him and he is repaying you by giving away your financial stability to his family and he is adding extra work for you after you will be grieving his loss. NTA but your husband is.", "NTA.  Don't sign anything.  Not a lawyer, BUT If the will get voided because it cant be fulfilled, then in theory it should all go to you, and you can decide how to give it out.", "NTA\n\nYour feelings are valid, the uncle is TA for pushing hard at the wrong time. Don't feel pressured to sign something you don't want to. Take your time and settle the estate in the manner that you see fit.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your husband's done everything he needs to do legally.  \n\nYou're right to be offended.  His uncle is being disrepectful to both of you.  \n\nIf the family members he's speaking on behalf of feel they need this assurance, then they should get their own legal advice (I'm assuming this uncle isn't a lawyer).", "NTA - I would want to know who has been speaking with the uncle so you can have the names of people you need to block once your husband passes. \n\nI am so sorry about your husband but it seems it was a very loving and healthy relationship. The fact the had the lawyer uncle come over in a time that is needed to be spent with loving memories and together is despicable. Do not sign anything as you know who you are and will fulfill your husbands wishes. You are already doing way more than any other wife for the in-laws.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He should not put you in the position of having to lose your home to fund an inheritance to his family.   Sounds like your husbands greedy family is trying to trick you into promising whatever you may be legally entitled to to fund their inheritance.  Sign nothing and get a lawyer to help you find out what you are entitled to under law regardless of the will.  And tell his family to stay away from you until your husbands funeral.", "NTA. Vultures are disgusting", "NTA  Isn't your home marital property? As such, one person can NOT distribute it in a will while the spouse is still alive. Speak to an attorney who specializes in wills to make sure your husband isn't trying to give away your property. I would think twice how I care for someone who wanted to leave me homeless after being married and everything I did.", "After the gifts there is money left for me. Including the 401k it\u2019s about 50% to family. It\u2019s that the estate won\u2019t cover the gift value, it needs some money from the 401k to cover it.

And the estate value is not insignificant so I will be well taken care of even in receiving 50%.

But the gifts are sufficiently significant that I would have to either keep the house and some of the 401k to at least be happy for a few years, or sell the house and have all the 401k to rebuild somewhere else. They\u2019re just worried the estate won\u2019t cover the gifts and I\u2019ll keep all the 401k.\n\nI also want to be clear. \u201cThey\u201d are the family, and I acknowledge the uncle is only one person in a larger group.
