Half of the money in \"his estate\" is yours at the very least. You mention that you make more than him, so really whatever that percentage is yours and the remainder is what should be divided if appropriate. And even THAT shouldn't be given entirely to his family. Right now you are giving away YOUR estate too.", "NTA\n\nUncle IL is a an asshole for asking you to sign this.  And he's probably doing so because he realizes that your husband doesn't actually have an estate to leave (or, at least, not much of one).\n\nYour husband's superannuation can't be left to his siblings by law.  Unless he has other dependents who live with him, all of the death benefits for your husband's superannuation go to you.  So, those aren't part of his estate.\n\nDepending on how the house is titled and how your bank accounts are held, those may also go directly to you upon your husband's passing.  (AFor instance, here in the US, our house is titled \"joint with rights of survivorship\" which means if something happens to me, my husband becomes the sole owner of our house and our kids don't get any part of it.  Similarly with our joy not account.)\n\nI understand your husband's desire to help his siblings.  And I applaud you for wanting to fulfill his wishes.  However, I would encourage you to meet with your own attorney and financial planner to determine how you could best meet your husband's desires after his passing without having to make any sudden decisions (such as selling the house) and in a manner that best helps his siblings (large lump sums may be wasted whereas regular gifts over time might be better).  It's possible that you could keep the house, keep some of the superannuation and give the siings gifts over time from your income.  This isn't necessarily something that you need to bother your husband about, but could be something you work out after his passing.\n\nBut absolutely don't sign anything unless your attorney says it's in your best interest to do so.  If Uncle wants to helps his siblings so much, he can give them his own money.\n\nAnd be careful with your ILs altogether.  If they start hassles mg you for money immediately, remember you don't have to give them anything that isn't legally required.  If they are bothering you, it may be best to keep the superannuation, house, and anything else legal in your own name and then determine one your own whether you wish to give gifts to fulfill your husband's intent.\n\nIn the meantime, please spend as much time with your husband.
