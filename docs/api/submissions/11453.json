I am close w/ friend \u201cS\u201d (24f) and her bf \u201cA\u201d (24m). They have been together around 1yr. A has always been touchy/flirty w/ me eg one time at a party he told me to sit on his lap as there were no spaces. I always thought of it as his character as my friend never used to mind. My exbf did so I was happy to ignore and maintain some respectful distance.\n\n3days ago omw home I got a text from A that him and S had leftover food if I wanted. I said yes, thanked him; he said he would bring it over. He came over alone to give it and started lingering. I started plating the food but found it odd that he was just watching me. He was being flirty so I started recording using vn app in case it could backfire on me as S tends to always side w A. He said he couldn\u2019t stop thinking or worrying about me and was glad I broke up with ex. I laughed it off and said dw, I\u2019m good.

I was annoyed- so she noticed that he did but never said anything. I said that i have done everything that I could to refuse/dismiss him nicely, I didn\u2019t PUSH him to say that and she was using me as a scapegoat to justify staying with A as he could do no wrong for her. They left angrily.\n\nI haven\u2019t told other friends about this as I don\u2019t want to spread S\u2019s business but feel really shit about what I said.

Your friend is a pathetic. Her bf is a creep and you informed her of that, it doesn\u2019t matter what you were wearing or whatever the fuck excuses she wants to make for her creepy ass bf. Stop trying to convince her he\u2019s a creep, it won\u2019t do you any good and will just damage your friendship. In my experience it\u2019s best to distance yourself from her until she gets smart.

Stay away from both of them. She\u2019ll see when he cheats with someone who isn\u2019t you. I\u2019d dodge that mess entirely and just sit back and watch.

I felt better at least loool.", "So, when he said he wanted to say something but was afraid he was going to get slapped I laughed and said what is it. And he just laughed and kept saying nah nah.

I do feel like this would happen though but I have a feeling he\u2019s knows I\u2019ve told her so I guess we\u2019ll just have to see if they stay together", "Don\u2019t be sorry, could you explain why?", "Time to stop hanging out with both of them until she stops displacing the blame for his behavior onto you.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want to believe it\u2019s all him, maybe because he manipulates her; maybe from low self-esteem and she thinks he\u2019s all she is worth; maybe she doesn\u2019t want to realize she chose so badly; maybe due to sunk cost fallacy, where she can\u2019t stand to \u201cwaste\u201d the time she\u2019s invested in him already (so she wastes more\u2026.)\n\nWhatever reason it is, the only sane and safe thing you can do is remove yourself from the equation. \n\nYes it means losing your friend, I am sorry, but at the moment she is no friend to you anyway; and maybe after a while she will come to realize he\u2019s still a jerk without you around to blame it on.
