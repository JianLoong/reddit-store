I am close w/ friend \u201cS\u201d (24f) and her bf \u201cA\u201d (24m). They have been together around 1yr. A has always been touchy/flirty w/ me eg one time at a party he told me to sit on his lap as there were no spaces. I always thought of it as his character as my friend never used to mind. My exbf did so I was happy to ignore and maintain some respectful distance.\n\n3days ago omw home I got a text from A that him and S had leftover food if I wanted. I said yes, thanked him; he said he would bring it over. He came over alone to give it and started lingering. I started plating the food but found it odd that he was just watching me. He was being flirty so I started recording using vn app in case it could backfire on me as S tends to always side w A. He said he couldn\u2019t stop thinking or worrying about me and was glad I broke up with ex. I laughed it off and said dw, I\u2019m good. He said he wanted to do something but was afraid he\u2019d get \u201cslapped\u201d. I said what and he kept saying nah nah, but after I kept asking what,he leaned in super close and said he wanted to kiss me. I shut him down said it\u2019s wrong, he\u2019s with S. he immediately apologised, said it was out of line, said he was not thinking straight and left.\n\nNext day, I call S; she comes with her cousin as they were out. I tell her privately but she wants cousin to hear too so I play vn. She is pissed. I tell her I\u2019m sorry and stroke her back but she abruptly asks me what I was wearing (tanktop and shorts). She asks w/ or w/out bra. I find this rude and say w/ but it doesn\u2019t matter as I wasn\u2019t trying to seduce him, it was the opposite.

I said I didn\u2019t push; I just gave him the opportunity to say what he wanted and that other girls wouldn\u2019t stop themselves if they didn\u2019t know her, so he was the issue. She said I was. \n\nShe said I pushed it bc I knew I could get him as I like the attention &I have said it myself (I have been partying lately and have said before I like attention from SINGLE men as I am also SINGLE) I said not from your taken bf and that she knows how many times I have refused to hang with him alone.\n \nS said he only does it with me and I have always been the only girl who\u2019s an issue and then looked at cousin who nodded. I was annoyed- so she noticed that he did but never said anything. I said that i have done everything that I could to refuse/dismiss him nicely, I didn\u2019t PUSH him to say that and she was using me as a scapegoat to justify staying with A as he could do no wrong for her. They left angrily.\n\nI haven\u2019t told other friends about this as I don\u2019t want to spread S\u2019s business but feel really shit about what I said.

S and Cousin are disconnected from reality. If the BF declared that he wanted to kiss you, after flirting with you and you not responding, S needs to review whether she's in a solid thing.\n\nAnd you need a better class of friend, I think.", "NTA. Your friend is a pathetic. Her bf is a creep and you informed her of that, it doesn\u2019t matter what you were wearing or whatever the fuck excuses she wants to make for her creepy ass bf. Stop trying to convince her he\u2019s a creep, it won\u2019t do you any good and will just damage your friendship. In my experience it\u2019s best to distance yourself from her until she gets smart. You don\u2019t need to feel bad because some creep put you in an uncomfortable position.", "NTA. I hope the day comes when women no longer make shitty excuses for men, but I'm not holding my breath as I enjoy being alive.", "Your friend is in denial ....might wanna take a few steps back from this friendship .", "NTA There are people who want to know the truth so bad they ask random people on the internet to help them find out. Guarantee you will be blamed. Sad.

At the first indication that she is trying to sabotage your friendships, you should send a text/email saying A has been sexually harassing you for months, tried to cheat on S with you, and S is trying to blame you because if she didn't she'd have to confront the fact that her boyfriend is an asshole.", "NTA. Stay away from both of them. She\u2019ll see when he cheats with someone who isn\u2019t you. I\u2019d dodge that mess entirely and just sit back and watch. Him making moves on you definitely shows he\u2019s going to cheat and she\u2019s just going to blame the girl", "NTA. Sometimes people don't want to hear the truth. Sad, but not much you can do about it. She will find out when she ultimately catches him cheating.", "NTA. But she is not ready to release him, so you will never convince her of that. I recommend letting her know you will be there for her, (if you want) but you two need some space and to you don't want to deal with her hands boyfriend ever again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s straight up trash. NTA.", "Or that you cared so little about being attractive to him that you didn't bother to change? Why would you \"cover up\"?\n\nYour friend is mad and sad. Mad, taking her partner's mess out on you. Sad, because *she knows*. She knows.", "This is correct advice - your name is at stake at this point if she spins the narrative out of anger.

But I'd still have it as backup and ready to send the first time I sensed that my friends had been told a lie about me.", "But if she's saying you came on to her BF, then she's airing business. \n\nNone of this was your fault. A is a cheater and has harassed you. It doesn't matter what you were wearing/not wearing. A man in a committed relationship doesn't try to put moves on other women."]}
