She sounds like a horrible doctor!", "NTA. Dude, get a divorce. If she's doing something like this to an innocent woman, imagine what she'll do to you. You're gonna end up on dateline", "Ntah you did what was ethically right.", "Probably would have been better if you told her ahead of time.\n\nIf your marriage survives this incident then you may be wanting to learn (from her) how she went from this person you love and respected to this.  If you look at her with compassion then maybe she may be recognize that she has become someone she does not want to be.  Or this personality and character has gone too far down the rabbit hole to change back.", "YTA\n\n\nYour wife needs help. She's burned out which is common among doctors.  You should have talked to her, and moved towards therapy.  A job change can also help.  Every clinics, office, and hospital has a culture.  Some of them are very supportive(very in a relative sense) and some are less supportive.  She should seek a job that supports patient's better.  That culture rubs off, and can help.  Reporting her co-workers won't help her.\n\n\nTalk to your wife.  Keep trying to help. Let her know she's not alone in her suffering. She has you.  And her problem isn't a sign of failure, it's a response to how medicine is today. Maybe when she gets home and complains to the advocacy hotline let her know you've seen a change.", "I told her what she\u2019s doing is ridiculous. He reply is that I\u2019m no fun and she\u2019ll then separate herself from me. I\u2019ve already checked out mentally to be honest."]}
