I understand that. What I don\u2019t understand is how 2 or 3 people each parade, will pull into my driveway or drive in my yard and park on my grass or driveway. Now I used to not bat an eye at this situation because, parades last like 30 minutes right? Well lately they\u2019ve been hours, including people who show up early to get settled in. My mom now can\u2019t get into her garage after coming home from work because there\u2019s a f250 smack dab in the middle of our driveway. Not to the side, literally at the very beginning of the driveway taking up all the space. So this Christmas parade I saw the same f250 and walked by him while he sits in his truck and gave him a confused look while walking to my house. A look of \u201cdo I know you and why are you in my driveway?\u201d I look at my house and look back at him and he scoffs, rolls his eyes, and pulls out. A old lady parks her car on my grass.

We had a designated driveway for our car, but when there were little league games going on, I would find a car blocking my driveway.

My husband also had a friend at the municipal building who sent a crew to paint our curb yellow (our neighbor saw this and also asked they paint her curb yellow since she had the same problem). After all this, the parked cars stopped. Bottom line is no one should be taking liberties on your property and you have options. Don\u2019t be afraid to accuse these people of trespassing and that you will be having their car towed if they leave it there. Like others suggested, put up a sign that any unauthorized car on, or blocking entry to, your property will be towed at owner\u2019s expense.

Get some stakes and put up yellow tape along yard and a couple no parking signs. At end of drive way put orange cones to block it with No parking signs.
