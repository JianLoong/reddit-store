This morning I followed a mom who was texting while taking her kid to school. I was also dropping off my kids and I was like \u201cthis person is about to hit those parked cars\u201d because she kept veering over to the right. She drove slow\u2026 I could see her eyes looking down every two seconds while we were in the main line and lots of kids around.  We finally get to the top and even though you\u2019re supposed to pull all the way forward, she stopped right in front of the gate so every other person behind her couldn\u2019t move up, which allows more parents to drop off. She kept on texting in the line on the way out. Who tf is she texting at 7:50am that is sooo important?\n\nSo yeah. People are complete, selfish idiots who don\u2019t even care about texting while driving with their kids. \n\nSorry. That rant felt good though.", "it probably would have taken longer to have to wait for the tow truck to get there and tow the car then walking down the street and ask the person to move the car", "Wouldn't that have taken much longer", "A tow truck would have taken longer", "You love next to the bar?  I would love in the bar, way more fun.", "I'm confused, are your moral judgements based exclusively on this person's wife? NTA.", "NO NTA at all. \n\nYou talk about manners. Manners are a 2 way street. She had NO Manners and thus she desreves non in return. She is lucky that it was not my driveway as I would not have even looked to see where the person was. I would just called the police and not only would she be ticketed by the police, they would also have had the car towed, thus causing her NOT to have a car to drive home. Then she would have had to pay the ticket and also all the tow fees. \n\nYou NEVER pack in front of someone driveway.", "No, literally parked across my driveway meaning I couldn't get in/out of my property.", "Yes, it was. Where I live it is completely illegal and there's really no way that anyone with a licence isn't aware of that. She was completely full of shit in telling me she didn't realise she couldn't park there, which is probably why I went harder at her.", "Yep I absolutely would have regardless of who it was.", "Are you for real? I would hardly classify the entrance to one's driveway as public road.", "You're kidding right?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

These stories on Reddit are wild.", "Yes!!!", "That\u2019s why you call a  tow truck. They don\u2019t give you time to find the owner and move it, they just hook up and take off", "If they\u2019re breaking the law, then the owner is obligated to pay.", "It's almost always whoever wants their car back that pays.", "Since when? Whoever parked illegally has to pay to get the car out of impound. That's literally the consequences of parking illegally when you get caught.", "Not always.", "Sounds like this may have been your car. Next time don't park blocking someone's driveway or your car will be towed.", "this is almost certainly not true. \n\nsource : i work in a gas station and i call tow trucks on people a few times a month. \n\nof course it may be different as i do so at my place of work.", "I have had people towed and have never once paid. If they want their car back, they pay the towing fee and the impound fee.", "Parking *in* someone's driveway is a civil matter, parking illegally on the public street is not.", "In what city is blocking someone's access to their own driveway a civil matter?  Can you give an example?", "This is just incorrect", "Right. And the towing company would expect payment up front from a private party.", "I. The US, if any vehicle is blocking a driveway (it doesn\u2019t have to be painted) that it towable,", "I don\u2019t know why people keep saying this. I can say with authority that people never had common sense.  My long-dead parents would have said the same.", "A lot of people in this sub are young.  He did the right thing by asking the neighbor to move it but acted immature by berating her.  After all he has to live with that neighbor and now he probably fell out of favor with them.  Regardless that woman was obviously wrong but no need to berate her when she was moving the car.", "Maybe she needed a shock to get her head out of her arse?", "That\u2019s not true. Towing for illegally parked cars does not charge you. They charge the person when that person comes to get the car from the lot.", "\"Cars blocking driveways is more than just a nuisance. It's illegal. In most states, a car blocking a public or private driveway may be towed, with a ticket issued to the owner.

Police, fire and ambulance need access to each building at all times.", "\u201cThese days\u201d drives me batty.", "Maybe standing outside in the cold and berating a stranger as they are moving their car is an overreaction.?", "yes, a jolt is often needed to dislodge large head from tight ass...", "Yes. Which is not an admission of a mistake, as the parent post suggested.", "She blocked my driveway, I couldn't enter my garage.", "Yeah. This makes so much sense.", "Maybe not...", "lol. Let me fix my response. Across can have two meanings."]}
