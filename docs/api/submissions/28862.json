That meant they weren't allowed to set foot on our property or they would have been arrested.\n\nAfter many, many, many times of telling them not to park on our property, they finally got the message this time.", "Yeah,  he could've done [this....](https://youtu.be/O9Pr1DRBJbU?si=6syc6eoS2AggGIPS)", "I have had that happen where I live my self I just hooked on the front right tire and pulled it into the middle of the street.  When I checked 20 minutes later cops and a tow truck were there was enjoyable to watch them take it away", "This sounds like it could be in the UK due to the yellow line and the police wouldn't get involved with that. It's down to the local council to issue a ticket and/or tow the car. To make matters worse there are driveways in the UK that aren't legal, as in they haven't had the authority to make parking in front of their house illegal. So actually parking in front of them isn't illegal unless there is a dropped curb, yellow line or other road markings. \nIt's quite interesting as I've seen people park in front of driveways that have no dropped curbs. Essentially, the homeowner/tenant can't do anything about it as the owner hasn't sought the council's permission. When you get a driveway, you remove a minimum of 1 parking space from that road, which could cause problems for other roads.", "These are the same individuals who like to pretend they are the only ones on the road.", "Exactly what I was thinking.", "Eh, it\u2019s the \u201ccontinued to berate\u201d comment that\u2019s bothering me. What\u2019s the point? That seems like the AH move that his wife is probably referring to.", "Agreed ESH. I've blocked a driveway before and not realized it. The first time I visited my girlfriends apartment to meet her roommates, I was nervous and running late. I parked in what I thought was an open spot on her street. I didn't even see the driveway. The next door neighbor noticed and texted them to see if they knew who's car it was. I went out and moved it. It wasn't a huge deal. They didn't yell at me or anything. A few jokes were made at my expense about it but no one berated me over it.", "Ding ding ding!!!!", "and sometimes they just keep on doing them even after that.", "My cousin had something similar happen but their response was, \"just go across the lawn.\" He took his phone out to record, and asked them to repeat that, and they did.\n\nHe went across THEIR lawn, and wasn't kind about it. When confronted, he played the video. \"You told me to go across the lawn, so I did, and I'll continue to do so if I have to.\" Problem solved.", "If you\u2019re the property owner, you can call a tow company directly.", "But of course, if you took moving the offending vehicle(s) upon yourself, the coppers would likely waste no time charging you.", "No. It's a civil matter to park *in* someone's driveway. \n\nYou aren't even allowed to *block* your *own* driveway by street access due to public safety. So what happened here was 100% illegal.", "She's am idiot and thinks that because this is in the UK that they can park anywhere if there is no single or double yellow line", "That would be ESH not YTA, since you agree the parker is being a jerk.", "If you can't find the answer on Google, try calling the non-emergency police number, or a tow company, and ask them. \"Hey, I had someone park across the end of my drive so it was inaccessible. If this were to happen in the future, would I be able to call a tow company to have the offending vehicle removed, or would I need to contact the police?\"", "That's not a natural consequence.\n\nA natural consequence would be if you left your purse at the foot of somebody's driveway and it got run over when somebody drove into or out of the driveway.\n\nYou're thinking of the phrase *logical consequence*. However, the *logical consequence* of parking in front of a driveway is that somebody drags you away from the party and you have to move your car and park somewhere else and the whole thing takes more time than if you'd just found another parking spot to begin with.\n\nBerating somebody is punishment, which... honestly, is of limited efficacy.", "And she got the wakeup call when she had to leave the party and move her car. She probably doesn't need more than that.", "She already got the wake up call, berating someone is not a wake up call.", "He would have parked on the street, gone inside, and resolved the situation after the emergency, like a normal person.", "> it's super weird people here are okay with this man yelling at a woman he doesn't know who was actively taking steps to correct the dumb thing she did.\n\nI am a 60 year old woman who does this ALL THE TIME when my next door neighbors' company blocks my driveway ALL THE TIME.  I don't/didn't really care if they are men or women and I didn't and don't care that they come right out when I ask them to move.  You just don't block someone's driveway without permission!", "You\u2019d rather pay like 3-600$ for a tow than have someone who you dumbly inconvenienced call you dumb?

No one was in danger, nothing bad happened. His feelings are valid, but it's not valid to stand around yelling at someone for an extended amount of time. \n\nLike I said, after awhile you're doing it because it feels good to you and not because the person deserves it and all it does is make you look unhinged yelling and lecturing someone who doesn't care or already apologized.", "You're saying that like you think you got me somehow but I genuinely wouldn't care if he did that, as long as he's within the law. \n\nI think he's fine to say something. I think an extended berating is unreasonable for what happened and I personally wouldn't bother staying to listen to it. \n\nI mean, I wouldn't have parked there, either. But when I make mistakes I apologize and correct myself. No one inherently deserves to get berated. Some situations can call for it, I don't think this was one.\n\nEdit: do to don't", "Exactly that. \u261d\ufe0f you are right.", "Takes far less time.  Park on the street, carry groceries in, call tow company, go on with evening as planned.", "Nah. I'm still sticking with op is TA", "Malicious compliance at its finest **chef's kiss*", "What a boss your cousin is lol", "What? That's not how it works in the slightest. Why speak when you don't know what you're talking about?", "Giving off strong incel vibes right there. Might wanna keep an eye on that my man.", "Do you not understand how ALL THE TIME and literally just one time are completely different", "Not teach each other lessons. Let people experience natural consequences, especially when they aren\u2019t dangerous or harmful. So if the driver was standing in the street and about to get run over by a car, you definitely yell or push them out of the way. If they come back to move their car after you\u2019ve had to wait in your car with your groceries and kid, you let them know how entitled it was of them and how much of a pain it was for you. I\u2019m not saying be a jerk. But you don\u2019t have to hide your frustration to protect someone\u2019s feelings from the logical consequences of their actions. Bet she never parks in front of a driveway again. Might not be as guaranteed if OP had just thanked her for moving her car.", "If an ambulance needed in someone could have died. If there was a fire her car would have been yeeted by the fire truck. It's not simply an inconvenience. She's lucky that OP didn't hook up a tow chain and drag the car into the street. She got off easy.", "Ah, you *are* stupid. I gotcha.", "I mean, she either shouldn't be driving or was brushing him off with the \"there's no yellow line, I thought parking there was fine\"", "The fact he left that out makes me think she was generally apologetic and he knew that would make him look bad.", "Get therapy.", "She's a thoughtless AH but would you have felt ok berating a  man or did you feel safe doing it because it was a young woman.  If you would have done it differently with a man, and I suspect you would, then you're an AH as well.", "Yes, you are TA. No need to continually berate someone who is moving like you\u2019ve asked them to. I would have told you to GFY if you continued to chew me out.", "ESH... embarrassing need to display \"power\" when u felt like u lost control... oof yikes", "Sorry; definitely TA for me. \n\nI get that it was upsetting and annoying to come home and find a car blocking your driveway.  \n\nHowever, the person came out without hesitation to move the car. So why were you screaming and berating her? Sounds like something else was going on and you took it out on her. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s annoying, but not a big enough deal to start verbally attacking someone. That\u2019s kinda weird. Just as weird as thinking it\u2019s ok to park in front of a driveway.", "Uh, YTA?\n\nYTA.", "I thought OP said the person was parked across the street from her driveway", "This is the lesson that this sub always misses. Yelling at and berating someone always makes you an asshole in my book, even if the other person is being a bigger asshole and completely in the wrong. I wouldn\u2019t call op the AH for having the car towed, or respectfully telling her how much of an inconvenience this caused and that she should know better. I also disagree with a lot of people on this sub that people need to be yelled at to receive the message, I don\u2019t think anyone responds better to anger and hostility. The woman might have been more apologetic and sincere if she wasn\u2019t immediately berated, but people often respond to hostility with more hostility. I\u2019m not trying to go full Ghandi Jesus or anything but OP probably knows there was a high road that could have been taken here.\nVery light ESH", "Very good point. Probably the best take imo.", "A single comment about being an idiot is fine.  \n\nContinuing beyond that definitely not cool", "Blocked my driveway", "I am not much of a one for stuff like this, but if we could get cars towed..\n\nIf it was like South Korea where you get a cut of the fine...\n\nEvery asshole parking along the friefighters' access to my building (nearly killed a friend who had a heart attack a few years ago) would be getting towed.", "What difference does it make with him being a man and her a woman?  Would it be ok if a woman yelled at a man?", "I've done this too, but it was around 10pm at night on a super tight street. No idea it was even a driveway since there weren't any street lamps, but I wasn't as lucky... my car got towed!", "I've always said, \"If your gonna slash a tire, slash two.\" Unless they're planning for it, cars only carry one spare.", "I\u2019ve lived in cities, small towns. I\u2019ve lived in desirable and undesirable neighborhoods. I\u2019ve blocked people in. I\u2019ve been blocked in. My point is I have seen/felt every part of this argument and still agree with the person you\u2019re responding to because they didn\u2019t say don\u2019t react, just temper your reaction. If OP had called a tow truck and walked inside, they would have had a less stressful day then marching all over the neighborhood and standing outside screaming at someone. Either way their driveway was blocked. Either way the person who blocked it sucked. Either way the person who blocked it has a bad day (either screamed at or car towed). The literal only difference is the amount of time OP spent with their blood pressure going through the roof. That\u2019s why the wife in the original story, who is probably not saying \u201cby all means park where you want at my inconvenience\u201d, still things OP is an AH. Not the only AH. One of the two in this story.", "I live in a rural area, and you just don't get to stand and yell at people. I'm sorry. \n\nYou CAN, obviously, if you want to. But again, after awhile I'm just gonna leave you there to yell at nothing because I don't care anymore. \n\nAnd I wouldn't stand around and yell at anyone, because I know that they, too, will just walk away from me and leave me looking stupid yelling at someone who doesn't care.", "For real, like, I feel like people make think im saying they can't react or be mad but go ahead and snap and say something to the person. Just don't stand there droning on about it unless something actually happened.", "No it's not grow up", "And if an emergency vehicle needed to get in?", "Yeah, which is why I have my second part of the post.", ">Some situations can call for it, I do think this was one.\n\nIs that a typo? It doesn't track with your earlier points.", "> grow up\n\nGee, that would hurt if I had any reason to value your opinion.", "I was gonna say this. When you block a driveway, you block emergency access.", "Emergency vehicles very rarely need or use driveways. If they had to get closer, they would drive into the yard or smash through her car if the situation was that serious.", "Then she should learn not to park over people's drives. \n\nActions have consequences. If you hit a random stranger, expect to get hit back, regardless of gender or whatever other thing people think should protect them.", "It is, ty", "It's not supposed to hurt and it's ok if you don't value my opinion.", "As a former EMT, we want to get as close to the scene as is safe. Driving across a lawn could drop us in a hole, we use th  driveway. And I've *never* seen an emergency vehicle 'smash through a car'.", "OP didn't leave it out. She said she thought it was fine to park there (across someone's driveway, really?) because there were no yellow lines. That's not an apology and it's the opposite of taking accountability.", "I have never once, in my entire life, seen an ambulance use the driveway. It is a completely impractical prospect. Backing in would take forever, and backing out would be extremely dangerous. I question the veracity of your statement.\n\nI have seen on multiple occasions, police SUVs smash through a car that was blocking their path and fire men smash through the windows of a vehicle in their way.\n\nRegardless, your hypothetical is not relevant to barating a woman in the street because she parked in front of your driveway.", "mofohank and I were talking about her attitude, which OP did not describe. we already know she's stupid af and her excuse was stupid, but if she said that with an apologetic tone vs an angry or confrontational one makes a huge difference.", " We always use the driveway, and we back in if we can. Do you live in a city where houses are close to the street? That might make sense. It doesn't in rural areas.", "I don't think it does. There's no way she doesn't know it's not right and often illegal to block someone's driveway.\n\nSo, even if she was being apologetic it's completely insincere, which is infuriating.\n\nIf she truly is this moronic then the lecture was in order imo", "You're hugely underestimating how stupid people can be and extrapolating from that. I've dealt with the public enough to know that she really might be that stupid. By OP's own words he was berating her, which reads to me like he raised his voice. I'll reiterate that a strange man yelling at a woman is really scary. If she was trying to fix the situation, scaring her is completely unnecessary. She would have had no way to know if OP was a psycho or not. If she was argumentative and rude the yelling is more justifiable.", "I don't think being stupid is an excuse. Frankly, her response is completely infuriating even if the tone is apologetic.\n\nCome on, she's not sorry she parked where she shouldn't, she's sorry she got caught and asked to move. \n\nThere's a driveway leading to a garage. If you're that much of an idiot and didn't know it wasn't allowed, from a moral perspective you'd still know that's not OK. \n\nAnd whilst the legal enforcement of parking across a driveway doesn't seem to be the consistent in a lot of places, I don't know of anywhere where parking in front of a garage  isn't some type of violation for which you'd be ticketed and towed.\n\nIgnorance is not an excuse for this level of idiocy and a telling off was the best outcome.", "On top of that unless your In a big busy downtown area \n\nResidential areas usually don't paint yellow on curbs.
