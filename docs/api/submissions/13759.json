Keep the communication brief and effective and use some common sense. No parent can just \"take a child away\" without courts getting involved. Yeah, the other custodial parent shouldn't be so childish, but unfortunately when a poor choice is made with a partner and children are involved, the reality is that those quirks must be endured. Simple as.", "YTA.\n\nChildren suck. Plain and simple. Ex partners suck, plain and simple. Unfortunately in your case, you absolutely have to endure it because it IS your child and it IS your ex/coparent that you have to communicate with. If it bothers you that much, you can be brief and give as simple answers as needed for whatever it is that comes up. Also, a parent can't threaten to take your kid away from you without getting courts involved so unless you actually got served papers to appear in court for it, you should absolutely be keeping minimal contact. It sucks but it is what it is. No communication is far worse than most pranks they can pull.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
