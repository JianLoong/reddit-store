Like many of you pointed out, it\u2019s my fault for allowing her to come in the first place. This country and specially this specific location is considered safe, but it\u2019s not idiot-proof. Something bad could have happened and I would\u2019ve blamed myself for it. \n\nI decided to be the bigger person and contacted Jessica earlier today after dropping my friends off at the airport. Our talk went really well. She explained that in the beginning, she was looking forward to our plans. She wanted to experience the \u201cglitz and glamour\u201d of the destination. In her head she would go to the beach clubs with us, guys would offer to buy her drinks and ask her out to dinner so she wouldn\u2019t have to pay for any of it. \n\nUnfortunately, reality didn\u2019t play out like that  and she started to grow resentful whenever one of us would get male attention. The final straw was when I wouldn\u2019t let her borrow a wetsuit from me when we went scuba diving (she wouldn\u2019t fit on any of our extras and I didn\u2019t want them to stretch or break). She said that it triggered her impostor syndrome and body dysmorphia, so she didn\u2019t want to go to hot spots with us as it was affecting her mental health. \n\nI told her that while I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I hope she realizes that my friends and I are not in the wrong for sticking to our original itinerary and not catering to her insecurities. We didn\u2019t bully her once and slandering us on social media for her own issues was unacceptable and unhinged. She genuinely apologized for her behaviour and she knew she was in the wrong.\n\nI also apologized for kicking her out in the heat of our fight and offered to pay for her hotel and any fees she had to pay in order to anticipate her flight. She thanked me and said that she would request the payment on a money app.\n\nEverything was going well until I saw the request for \u20ac5.000,00. What?!? I texted her asking if this is the right amount. She said yes. I ask for receipts, she didn\u2019t have any. I ask for bank statements or any sort of proof. She got angry and went back to being her rude, irrational self. \n\nI blocked her everywhere and I won\u2019t talk to her ever again.", "created_utc": 1673891419, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dlxg1/update_aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my/", "score": 1702, "replies": ["WELL, this took a turn at the end. \n\nYou are clearly way better off without this person. They have shown that they will not take any accountability for their own AH behavior.", "NTA (again!)\n\n\u20ac5K is probably the cost of her flight and **all expenses** for her failed 'dream vacay'.\n\nOverall, you come across as empathetic, generous and balanced ... ie. a truly good friend.", "You should have just stuck with the talk and not offered her money.", "Well done for trying to handle it properly. <3", "NTA.  It's another example of generosity being trumped by greed.  Dumping her was the right thing to do.  Be happy!", "Still NTA - she wanted a full refund? That's ridiculous and you are better without her. When I was on a trip recently and not feeling like I could commit to things, I did my own thing...because I'm an adult and I can (yes I am also a female and yes I was in a foreign country)..", "She\u2019s like a family member that crawls out of the woodwork when you come into money, inherit from a will, or win the lottery. So much entitlement.\n\nETA: absolutely NTA for anything", "Tough  situation for sure, sad that it ended that way with good intentions at the start.", "NTA, again.\n\nAnd I hope you learned your lesson abut Jessica.  And any future potential Jessicas.  Or anyone else with the same completely and total ignorance about travel and finances.", "I feel like posting screenshots of her audacity might be a good way to circumvent people who are going to bother OP again for whatever BS Jessica is going to post now", "Hahaha, yeah, when my aunt won the lottery, the vultures started circling immediately.", "NTA. She invited herself along on a trip that she couldn't afford and got upset with everyone except herself. She acknowledged her bad behavior. You generously offered to cover the extra cost she incurred as a result of you kicking her out. You were great.\n\nShe then asked for \u20ac5.000,00. That's insane.\n\nDid any of you spend that much on the entire trip?\n\nSounds to me like you should screenshot her request for \u20ac5.000,00 and be ready to share it on social media when she once again accuses you of being mean.", "Am I understanding this correctly? This woman came on the vacation and didn\u2019t have enough money to do the activities because she thought other travelers or locals would pick up her bar bills to flirt with her? And then got frustrated/stressed when it wasn\u2019t happening because she wouldn\u2019t have enough to pay for things? I feel like I might be too old or just too plain to really get this.", "I remember in my early 20s discovering which of my female friends survived off of male validation and the male gaze and which were just trying to hang out. I think it must be worse for the younger generation who can be exposed to TikToks on how to market yourself to get rich men to fund your lifestyle. Without giving young women the information that the men willing to do that usually expect things in return and are targeting young women for a reason.\n\nJessica is the girlfriend who abandons you on a night out because a guy she's interested in winked at her. And then throws temper tantrums & ends the evening early if you're at a venue where she feels she's not getting the most male attention. Ending the friendship was a good move.", "Lmao the 5k request \u2620", "holy shit, \u20ac5000!? That is enough for me to fly to Bali and live my absolute best life for *months*!  I cannot think of a single place where you would *reasonably* spend that much. This person is toxic and trying to take advantage of you, good thing for you blocking her", "There is some cases that is not worth It trying to be the bigger person still NTA", "Well, you had us....", "I love the \"its not idiot proof\" statement. I also enjoy how she confirmed that to be correct for the rest of the post. I'm sorry that you found yourself to be in this situation.", "Well you tried.. she spouted all of that woe is me talk and tried to fu*k you over I. The end. Smh well I\u2019m glad you know your limits and cut this \u201cfriendship\u201d off", "NTA", "NTA  You are better off without a \"Friend\" like that. You took the high road and that shows character, but you were smart to ask for receipts and proof when she tried to swindle you.", "Amazing how her expenses were exactly \u20ac5.000,00 to the cent.", "That's not entirely true. She will totally feign accountability for financial gain.", "Shocked she didn't scream *EMOTIONAL DISTRESS* for the excessive amount. Chick never should have gone on a vacation she knew she couldn't afford, point blank; sounds like a begpacker who wants others to pay their way.", "She probably just totally made the 5k amount up to try to fleece OP.", "Nah, this way she showed her true colours (again).", "Yes OP! Screenshot it, even if you don\u2019t plan to do anything with it. People like her like to paint themselves as victims (and she already has on social media once) and proof is good. Keep the text proof too.", "Or too grounded in reality...", "It's a wild plan to me, but I've known people like this (okay not like *this*, more like the people who do this in local bars). I'm not at all someone with whatever you need to pull this off, but it's fascinating to watch.\n\nI feel badly for OP though. Jessica took it to a whole new level.", "It was good for OP to see exactly who she is", "NTA -- you're a good person.", "LMAO you tried then showed her true colors again. You didn't do anything wrong and I wouldn't be paying a penny.", "NTA - do like you decided and don't talk to her ever again.", "She had me in the first 3 quarter, not gonna lie lmaoooooo\n\nHow did it go with your friends to whom she slandered you to? u/burnedflan", "Lol that last paragraph was a sharp turn. I thought everything was even and good.", "NTA\n\nYou are a good person to even offer to take care of the hotel after her behavior.\n\nShe didn't get a 5k hotel.   She still wanted to leech off you and get the 'glitz and glamour' for free.\n\nI'm proud of you for not caving.", "There's no way she had \u20ac5000 in cash on hand so there has to be a credit card transaction posted somewhere, and even with cash, there would be receipts. I wonder where she pulled that number out of...", ">In her head she would go to the beach clubs with us, guys would offer to buy her drinks and ask her out to dinner so she wouldn\u2019t have to pay for any of it.  \n\n\nomg this is not a friend you want to have, this behaviour is so trashy, she has no self respect \n\nyou are NTA", "Oh Christ yeah don't offer to reimburse her. Not with the attitude she has towards money.\n\nNTA even more.", "NTA.   \n\n\nThat wasn't a friend, you were being used.", "Wow. You tried to solve this issue. Then she went to demand 5k with no proof. That\u2019s not a friend.", "Nta", "NTA congrats on removing that toxic person from your life!", "NTA - after reading original post and this one she was trying to con everyone into creating HER dream vacation around her needs. Then when that failed sounds like she expected you to cover travel costs?  Uh no no one held her hostage to come.  She forced her way into the vacation to begin with by being over bearing.  She was the third wheel to begin with.  You owe her nothing.  Go full no contact and keep her out of your life.", "What. A user and scammer.", "[removed]", "Dude, we just did a 3 person 11 day vacation overseas from where we live for $4k. I can't imagine spending \u20ac5k  on one person for what sounds like a shorter trip.", "But...but where are the random strangers who were going to pay for her food and drinks THE WHOLE VACATION ??? /s", "> She invited herself along on a trip that she couldn't afford and got upset with everyone except herself.\n\nAnd according to her statement it was more about \"how dare guys go up to the other girls and try to buy them drinks and not me\" and then going off on how they exasperated her body dysmorphia \\*shivers\\* unhealthy is an understatement", "Except now OP has some pretty solid evidence that the problem is Jessica.  It\u2019s not longer \u201cshe said\u201d", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She didn't want you to be the bigger person but the gigantic person. Are you rich or something? I was already doubting she was willing to apologize after getting the event on social media dang didn't expect to be right that way", "HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA!!!! That escalated fast!", "Omg this sounds horribly uncomfortable.", "You showed your true colours (you're kind, generous, and a gem of a human)\n\nAnd she showed hers (she's just an asshole choosing beggar)", "Was going so well until the money request. Just be done with that \u201cfriend\u201d", "Well you did everything you could to try to reconcile. But it sounds like she just kept wanting to double down.\n\nYou are completely in the right here.

Did she stay in a full suite, order room service all the time, and empty the bar?  No, she was trying to take advantage of you.  No receipts is the giveaway here.  She didn\u2019t spend that.  She sounds like a drama queen who expects everyone to make allowances for her various disorders and  the tantrums that ensue.  She basically inserted herself into your plans for the holiday and then behaved badly.  Anyone on social media who is sympathetic to her is welcome to take her with them on their next vacation.  NTA", "NTA.... Still. I think she is looking for a refund on her trip. That was her second chance. She is not to be trusted with the truth.", "NTA but this tea is delicious lol she was being ridiculous, fuck out a here \u20ac5000 lmao", "Had me at the first half.", "Classic case of \"you had me in the first half\"...damn. Sorry op!", "Right\u203d OP would you like to be my friend?

I\u2019m sure there would\u2019ve been more issues in the future of OP hadn\u2019t done that so I\u2019m glad she saw the girl for who she truly was in the end.", "Tulum, easily with beach clubs. Especially it\u2019s the hottest place in Jan", "Maybe somewhere like Monaco and even then you'd be pushing it.", "Her AH?", "OP's better off without her Anna Delvey friend.", "Her planning on getting \u201cmale attention\u201d to afford some stuff is about the most short sighted plan I\u2019ve ever heard of.", "\"Begpacker\". Nice!", "Considering she didn\u2019t even have to pay for food and lodging as all this was provided by OPs parents, the 5k are either a first class flight or totally made up.", "Even though I don't condone it, some people can absolutely pull it off. Jessica obviously couldn't.", "It's a whole thing.", "I've read some awful stories about begpackers!  Some countries have taken to deporting them, which is definitely what should happen to them."]}
