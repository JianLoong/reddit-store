Like many of you pointed out, it\u2019s my fault for allowing her to come in the first place. This country and specially this specific location is considered safe, but it\u2019s not idiot-approved. Something bad could have happened and I would blame myself for it. \n\nI decided to be the bigger person and contacted Jessica earlier today after dropping my friends off at the airport. Our talk went really well. She explained that in the beginning, she was looking forward to our plans. She wanted to experience the \u201cglitz and glamour\u201d of the destination. In her head she would go to the beach clubs with us, guys would offer to buy her drinks and ask her out to dinner so she wouldn\u2019t have to pay for any of it. \n\nUnfortunately, reality didn\u2019t play out like that  and she started to grow resentful whenever one of us would get male attention. The final straw was when I wouldn\u2019t let her borrow a wetsuit from me when we went scuba diving (she wouldn\u2019t fit on any of our extras and I didn\u2019t want them to stretch or break). She said that it triggered her impostor syndrome and body dysmorphia, so she didn\u2019t want to go hot spots with us as it affecting her mental health. \n\nI told her that while I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I hope she realizes that my friends and I are not in the wrong for sticking to our original itinerary and not catering to her insecurities. We didn\u2019t bully her once and slandering us on social media for her own issues was unacceptable and unhinged. She genuinely apologized for her behaviour and she knew she was in the wrong.\n\nI also apologized for kicking her out in the heat of our fight and offered to pay for her hotel and any fees she had to pay in order to anticipate her flight. She thanked me and said that she would request the payment on a money app.\n\nEverything was going well until I saw the request for \u20ac5.000,00. What?!? I texted her asking if this is the right amount. She said yes. I ask for receipts, she didn\u2019t have any. I ask for bank statements or any sort of proof. She got angry and went back to being her rude, irrational self. \n\nI blocked her everywhere and I won\u2019t talk to her ever again.", "created_utc": 1673891419, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dlxg1/update_aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my/", "score": 368, "replies": ["WELL, this took a turn at the end. \n\nYou are clearly way better off without this person. They have shown that they will not take any accountability for their own AH behavior.", "NTA (again!)\n\n\u20ac5K is probably the cost of her flight and **all expenses** for her failed 'dream vacay'.\n\nOverall, you come across as empathetic, generous and balanced ... ie. a truly good friend.", "You should have just stuck with the talk and not offered her money.", "Well done for trying to handle it properly. <3", "NTA.  It's another example of generosity being trumped by greed.  Dumping her was the right thing to do.  Be happy!", "Still NTA - she wanted a full refund? That's ridiculous and you are better without her. When I was on a trip recently and not feeling like I could commit to things, I did my own thing...because I'm an adult and I can (yes I am also a female and yes I was in a foreign country)..", "She\u2019s like a family member that crawls out of the woodwork when you come into money, inherit from a will, or win the lottery. So much entitlement.\n\nETA: absolutely NTA for anything", "Tough  situation for sure, sad that it ended that way with good intentions at the start.", "NTA, again.\n\nAnd I hope you learned your lesson abut Jessica.  And any future potential Jessicas.  Or anyone else with the same completely and total ignorance about travel and finances.", "I feel like posting screenshots of her audacity might be a good way to circumvent people who are going to bother OP again for whatever BS Jessica is going to post now", "Hahaha, yeah, when my aunt won the lottery, the vultures started circling immediately.", "NTA. She invited herself along on a trip that she couldn't afford and got upset with everyone except herself. She acknowledged her bad behavior. You generously offered to cover the extra cost she incurred as a result of you kicking her out. You were great.\n\nShe then asked for \u20ac5.000,00. That's insane.\n\nDid any of you spend that much on the entire trip?\n\nSounds to me like you should screenshot her request for \u20ac5.000,00 and be ready to share it on social media when she once again accuses you of being mean.", "Am I understanding this correctly? This woman came on the vacation and didn\u2019t have enough money to do the activities because she thought other travelers or locals would pick up her bar bills to flirt with her? And then got frustrated/stressed when it wasn\u2019t happening because she wouldn\u2019t have enough to pay for things? I feel like I might be too old or just too plain to really get this.", "I remember in my early 20s discovering which of my female friends survived off of male validation and the male gaze and which were just trying to hang out. I think it must be worse for the younger generation who can be exposed to TikToks on how to market yourself to get rich men to fund your lifestyle. Without giving young women the information that the men willing to do that usually expect things in return and are targeting young women for a reason.\n\nJessica is the girlfriend who abandons you on a night out because a guy she's interested in winked at her. And then throws temper tantrums & ends the evening early if you're at a venue where she feels she's not getting the most male attention. Ending the friendship was a good move.", "Lmao the 5k request \u2620", "holy shit, \u20ac5000!? That is enough for me to fly to Bali and live my absolute best life for *months*!  I cannot think of a single place where you would *reasonably* spend that much. This person is toxic and trying to take advantage of you, good thing for you blocking her", "There is some cases that is not worth It trying to be the bigger person still NTA", "Well, you had us....", "I love the \"its not idiot proof\" statement. I also enjoy how she confirmed that to be correct for the rest of the post. I'm sorry that you found yourself to be in this situation.", "Well you tried.. she spouted all of that woe is me talk and tried to fu*k you over I. The end. Smh well I\u2019m glad you know your limits and cut this \u201cfriendship\u201d off", "NTA", "NTA  You are better off without a \"Friend\" like that. You took the high road and that shows character, but you were smart to ask for receipts and proof when she tried to swindle you.", "Amazing how her expenses were exactly \u20ac5.000,00 to the cent.", "That's not entirely true. She will totally feign accountability for financial gain.", "Shocked she didn't scream *EMOTIONAL DISTRESS* for the excessive amount. Chick never should have gone on a vacation she knew she couldn't afford, point blank; sounds like a begpacker who wants others to pay their way.", "She probably just totally made the 5k amount up to try to fleece OP.", "Nah, this way she showed her true colours (again).", "Yes OP! Screenshot it, even if you don\u2019t plan to do anything with it. People like her like to paint themselves as victims (and she already has on social media once) and proof is good. Keep the text proof too.", "Or too grounded in reality...", "It's a wild plan to me, but I've known people like this (okay not like *this*, more like the people who do this in local bars). I'm not at all someone with whatever you need to pull this off, but it's fascinating to watch.\n\nI feel badly for OP though. Jessica took it to a whole new level.", "It was good for OP to see exactly who she is"]}
