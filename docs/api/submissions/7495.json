Like many of you pointed out, it\u2019s my fault for allowing her to come in the first place. This country and specially this specific location is considered safe, but it\u2019s not idiot-proof. Something bad could have happened and I would\u2019ve blamed myself for it. \n\nI decided to be the bigger person and contacted Jessica earlier today after dropping my friends off at the airport. Our talk went really well. She explained that in the beginning, she was looking forward to our plans. She wanted to experience the \u201cglitz and glamour\u201d of the destination. In her head she would go to the beach clubs with us, guys would offer to buy her drinks and ask her out to dinner so she wouldn\u2019t have to pay for any of it. \n\nUnfortunately, reality didn\u2019t play out like that  and she started to grow resentful whenever one of us would get male attention. The final straw was when I wouldn\u2019t let her borrow a wetsuit from me when we went scuba diving (she wouldn\u2019t fit on any of our extras and I didn\u2019t want them to stretch or break). She said that it triggered her impostor syndrome and body dysmorphia, so she didn\u2019t want to go to hot spots with us as it was affecting her mental health. \n\nI told her that while I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I hope she realizes that my friends and I are not in the wrong for sticking to our original itinerary and not catering to her insecurities. We didn\u2019t bully her once and slandering us on social media for her own issues was unacceptable and unhinged. She genuinely apologized for her behaviour and she knew she was in the wrong.\n\nI also apologized for kicking her out in the heat of our fight and offered to pay for her hotel and any fees she had to pay in order to anticipate her flight. She thanked me and said that she would request the payment on a money app.\n\nEverything was going well until I saw the request for \u20ac5.000,00. What?!? I texted her asking if this is the right amount. She said yes. I ask for receipts, she didn\u2019t have any. I ask for bank statements or any sort of proof. She got angry and went back to being her rude, irrational self. \n\nI blocked her everywhere and I won\u2019t talk to her ever again.", "created_utc": 1673891419, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dlxg1/update_aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my/", "score": 3815, "replies": ["WELL, this took a turn at the end. \n\nYou are clearly way better off without this person.

Without giving young women the information that the men willing to do that usually expect things in return and are targeting young women for a reason.\n\nJessica is the girlfriend who abandons you on a night out because a guy she's interested in winked at her.

Not to mention the things they wanted to do during their vacations seem to be not super cheap. \n\nThe way I see it Jessica first forced OP though public pressure to accept her into her travel group though she was only an acquaintance of her. \n\nThen she used emotional manipulations to change their itinerary, what things they are doing on vacation. \n\nThen she went the social media route, likely another try to manipulate OP to follow her wishes.

As I suspect OP is rich, Jessica might have thought that there is a good chance that she can manipulate money out from her. And it would have worked sadly.

Like, yeah it's awesome being able to fly to Sicily or Malta or wherever for \u20ac60, but you're gonna be departing at 4am and basically lose the first day of your trip.", "I  didnt read the original, read the start of it was like, yeah, maybe they were a bit of an AH kicking her out, then I got to that part and I was like, there is absolutely no way this chick is not completely at fault for whatever happened and she is completely unhinged. Holy moly...", "Especially when she's with a group. How is she going to spend time doing glamorous things with her friends *and* get some schmuck to pick up the expense for only her?", "People in Utah are notoriously cheap. Date costs are often split down the middle until after the couple marries. Waitstaff at lucky if they get a 10% tip from most native Utahans. \n\nThere's also tribalism. If you aren't a member of the LDS church, a large portion of the populace aren't interested in being your friend. Wearing revealing clothes is a dead giveaway that you are not LDS. In fact, most look for the tell tale signs that you are wearing Mormon religious garments. \n\nSource: 20ish years living in Utah, 26 years being Mormon.", "Think about it a little bit... \ud83d\ude07", "Thank you r/junior_Ad_7613 for the interrobang link. Learn something new everyday. And OP NTA ...you tried to do the right thing by talking to her but knowing how sketchy she had been the entire trip I think it was too much offering to pay for her hotel. She invited herself along on a trip with barely known acquaintances, her meal plan was banking on random guys to line up to buy her drinks and buy all her meals, tried to change every activity because she would have to pay out of her own wallet, so of course she tried to charge you a ridiculous extortion fee without receipts or based in reality. After all she did tell you upfront it was HER DrEaM VaCaTiOn!!!", "Also the highest porn usage per capita. Again, make of that what you will.", "True.  I grew up out of state in an area where quick and casual connection with strangers is very common.  I expected strangers to try and chat with me while waiting in long lines, especially if cell service sucked.\n\nI was *not* expecting how hostile Utah is to anyone attempting to make casual conversation.  They warm right up as soon as they figure out you're not in an MLM or proselytizing, but dang if it wasn't awkward trying to meet people here after moving.", "I'll stay way from Utah is what I will make of it.", "Are you a troll or...\n\n\n\n\nFriendo, fat people can be gorgeous, but it's much harder than for a non-overweight person and requires them to usually be an already conventionally attractive person with extra weight instead of just average and fat. How you carry yourself also hugely affects attraction and desperate insecurity doesn't help that.\n\n\n\nAlso fighting against body shaming something that in 90% of cases can be fixed fairly easily... by bodyshaming something that requires invasive surgery to slightly alter, stay classy.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s what they\u2019re told to believe, it\u2019s just what they\u2019re sexually attracted to. You can\u2019t really change your sexual attraction just by telling yourself something is hot. And biologically it makes sense that we\u2019re sexually attracted to healthy bodies and not to unhealthy extremes whether it\u2019s too skinny or too big.", "I know many stunning fat people. I also know that due to body shaming very like the kind in which you\u2019re engaged, they are not considered \u201cconventionally attractive\u201d in the culture in which I live. Because I pay attention to society around me, because I *have to*, because it\u2019s literally not safe to be uninformed.\n\nOh, and since you\u2019re assuming a whole lot of both that commenter\u2019s gender and reasoning in your\u2026 statement\u2026, if you reply to this I\u2019d prefer my body-shaming vitriol in afab flavor, please and thank you.", "Yeah almost like that was the point. Fat shaming is cool right? But comparing a dudes energy to dick size and suddenly we have a problem.", "NTA\nThat plot twist though", "r/unexpected", "Leave Anna Delvey alone!", "Honestly this is hilarious. Anyone who blames other people for \"triggering their impostor syndrome and body dysmorphia\" is a joke.\n\nBody Des morphia is a real thing comama and I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she actually has a diagnosed condition, but other women existing in the same world as you are not at fault. You are not justified for lashing out and you are certainly not justified for creating of completely fake story where you are the victim.\n\nThe usage of the term impostor syndrome is also a complete joke because impostor sin from was actually coined by a black woman talking about being a black woman in professional spaces, having all of the credentials and ability to do the job but feeling like you don't belong anyway because of systemic issues like racism. So she's throwing these terms around to victimize herself but she doesn't even know what they mean.\n\nThen she thought she could pull a fast one on you by trying to play the victim and thought she could pray on your kindness 1 last time. What kind of a fool wouldn't check for receipts?\n\nBy the way, this is one thing I say repeatedly in situations where someone trashes people on the Internet. You are entitled to correct your reputation in the venue in which it was slandered. Meaning, it's rude to take stuff to social media but if someone slanders you on social media firsr you are entitled to do damage control with the truth. THEY made it public. With a lie no less.\n\nStill NTA, and good riddance.", "She sounds delusional, she expected random guys to just pay for everything so she wouldn't have to spend money? What kind of fantasy land does she live in?\n\nYou are better off without her in your life.", "NTA for this post. In the earlier post maybe e.s.h. \n\nWhat I get from both posts is that she is poor or cheap. This vacation probably stretched her resources to the limit. If she was poor she would live in the cheapest place she could find. Nevertheless cheeky of her to try and profit from the vacation at the end.", "Yeah once again definitely NTA she tried to take your good will and see how far she can get", "She should have never invited herself to someone\u2019s house period! Just don\u2019t invite yourself anywhere! Not being able to afford the trip is really just the cherry on top \ud83d\ude44", "5,000 euros, which is more.", "It sounds like she was trying to get you to pay for her whole trip. Don\u2019t give her any money.", "Tbf 99% of the population couldn't pull it off, you have to be insanely attractive for strangers to offer to just pay your bills every single time you go out.\n\nEven if Jessica was a supermodel her behavior is still delusional.", "Maybe she would have done better with badly cut polyester underwear sticking out of her clothing...", "The hiking is great there. And areas with non-mormons really cling together as a tight community."]}
