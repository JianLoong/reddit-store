Her dad (55M) came to this country in the 90s to work and made many good friends, which my dad (55M) was one of them. In the latter half of the decade, he returned to China to marry my girlfriend's mom and brought her back to my country. It's a very inspiring story.\n\nWe grew up together and it was a running joke between our dads that we would get married one day. Once we started going to middle school and high school together, we went to separate elementary schools, we got a lot closer. We started dating when we were 14. Her dad became very cold with me, which was expected considering I was dating his daughter, but my girlfriend said he would warm up to me in about two to three years. He did, until recently.\n\nAfter we graduated high school, my girlfriend moved in with my family since we're closer to the university. That's when her dad started to become cold to me again. I thought maybe it was because I took her daughter away, but my girlfriend's mom told me that my dad has been saying really sexual stuff about me to her dad.\n\nI confronted my dad about this and he confirmed it. He's said stuff like how I'm inside her or how we don't like wearing clothes when we're in the bedroom. I told him to maybe tone it down a bit, but he told me to chill out and that they're just jokes. I told him that if my girlfriend is the one I'll marry in the future, I want her dad to like me and that no dad wants to hear about their daughter's sex life. He said I'm overreacting and that I'm being an a-hole. AITA?\n\nEDIT: When I say her dad got cold after she moved in with me, I don't mean right away. We had sweet moment when they took me on a Christmas family vacation and I had a one on one with him. It was sometime after that that he started getting cold to me.\n\nEDIT: When I told him to tone it down, I meant no sex talk, not less sex talk, especially WITH HER DAD. Like they used to joke about how we'd get married one day and we'd be one big happy family. Or when we did start dating, he'd be like \"Haha my son kisses your daughter all the time.\" Tone down to that.", "created_utc": 1694296526, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ei1cp/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_hes_the_reason_my/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019d move with your girlfriend elsewhere.", "NTA \nWho jokes about their kids bedroom activity? Please find a space together if you want your relationship to thrive. Your father needs a hobby and something else to talk about. \n\nSome parents are so invested in their children's life that they forget their own personalities and interests when their children are grown.

Youre OK with him sexualizing your girlfriend?", "EEEWWWWwwww. Your dad should *not even be thinking* about what you 2 do in your bedroom, never mind talk about it.\n\nPlease, appreciate your GF's father for simply going cold instead of making a big fuss or being combative in anyway.

He's watched your girlfriend grow up and is still taking the time to sexualize her to her *own father.* Politely asking your father to stop speaking about you and your partner like that is SO far below what the reaction could have been.   \nI would talk to your FIL and let him know that you have nothing but respect for him and his daughter, and you're sorry that your father is so creepy, you don't condone it at all.", "NTA now, but you will be if you let it continue.

He\u2019s watched you both grow up and he\u2019s sexualizing y\u2019all?? Ew.", "NTA. Your dad is an egregious asshole, though. No one is so stupid that they don\u2019t know that making a joke about your own child\u2019s, let alone someone\u2019s child\u2019s sex life is out of bounds.

Shut  that down unequivocally.", " Maybe you could write down your thoughts and feelings in a letter. Take it to your girlfriends dad and ask his help in confronting your dad. Explain that you are totally embarrassed/humiliated about dads behaviour. Explain that dad is insisting that it\u2019s a joke and you are afraid to escalate the jokes to the point of forcing you and your gf to move out. This would affect both of your schooling. Point out it will take him, a respected/valued peer of his dads, to hopefully convince him he isn\u2019t being funny but in fact is offensive, harassing and going to lose him the respect of his friend and family.", ">He's said stuff like how I'm inside her or how we don't like wearing clothes when we're in the bedroom.\n\nWTF????\n\nThat's not a joke.

That is really super gross, does he really not have anything better to talk about than your sex life. Shall we discuss how completely disgusting his behavior towards your girl is?
