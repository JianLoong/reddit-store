But everyday she wait for us and ask for the tree to be taken down because is sick.\n\nSo I called a friend of mine who is a gardner and works with trees and asked if he could see if it's actually sick. My friend sees the tree and said that it is pretty healty, it needs some pruning and he will take care of him during the proper weather conditions.\n\nNow Marie insist for us to take down the tree and that my friend is not a professional cause the tree is sick, she knows what she is saying and we need to cut it down.\n\nMy SO wants to keep the peace with the new neighbours and cut down the olive tree but I want to keep it.

Also he realised the tree was of no nuisance to the neighbour either. There are many stories on here of neighbours pressuring new neighbours to cut down trees. I think a lot of it is some kind of weird power play. Saying I'm top dog here, the boss of you and you need to do what I say. They can then start ordering you to do other things.
