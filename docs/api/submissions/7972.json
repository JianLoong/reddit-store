It needs some work and some pruning but it is an healty tree and I like it very much because my last name is \"Olive\" and I like to think this is a sign for the house to be meant for me.\n\nThe problem is my new neighbour, Marie (60s F). She lives in the house on the left side from mine and doesn't like the tree. Note that the tree is on the right side my yard so it doesn't bother her yard or her house at all.\n\nFrom day 1 of remodeling Marie is asking us take down the tree cause the previous owner made their dog do his business on the tree so she is sure the tree is sick.\n\nAt first we said that we had to think about the house and the move so the tree was our last problem. But everyday she wait for us and ask for the tree to be taken down because is sick.\n\nSo I called a friend of mine who is a gardner and works with trees and asked if he could see if it's actually sick. My friend sees the tree and said that it is pretty healty, it needs some pruning and he will take care of him during the proper weather conditions.\n\nNow Marie insist for us to take down the tree and that my friend is not a professional cause the tree is sick, she knows what she is saying and we need to cut it down.\n\nMy SO wants to keep the peace with the new neighbours and cut down the olive tree but I want to keep it. It is an healty tree, far from Marie's house and I feel bad for take a life if there is not need for it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674379603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ifq8a/aita_for_not_cutting_down_a_tree/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Believe me when I say that the olive oil you can get from your trees, pressed the traditional way (in a specific place, not at home) tastes so much better than the typical olive oil we buy in the supermarket. \n\nDon't let your neighbour bully you.

Long story short, she didn\u2019t like our tree and took it upon herself to have it trimmed, and killed the tree. \n\nLaws will vary depending on where you live, and some countries (like the US) issues like this can end up going to court. If that is a possibility where you live, then I would recommend hiring an arborist to inspect the tree, and write a report on their findings. If the tree is healthy, and not a risk to your neighbor, then don\u2019t worry about and don\u2019t cut the tree. If it is at risk of falling, then it could be a safety issue for both you and your neighbor, and it should be removed.\n\nETA: NTA for wanting to keep the tree and don\u2019t let your neighbor bully you into taking it down", "NTA! I think it's very sweet how much you care for the tree! Also if you don't have some type of ring camera that's pointed towards the tree I would recommend getting one.
