The fact that he never acquiesces and it's his way or the highway is very  worrying.", "NTA You didn't personally wrong him so there is nothing to make up to him,same with the consequences. Does your partner often try to treat you like a child ? I don't wanna jump to he's abusive, but something is not right with your guys dynamic.", "The fact that your boyfriend is trying to parent you over something as small as not cracking a window by taking your video games away? That\u2019s asshole territory right there. \n\nThat\u2019s a major red flag planted, and I\u2019d die fighting on that hill. \n\nNTA. \n\n\nBut YTA if you don\u2019t grow a backbone and stick up for yourself. Don\u2019t be a rug and let him walk over you with this non-sensical bullshit.", "ARE YOU LIKE.... WHAT??? 12???\n\nYou are an adult and getting \"punished\" for such a small offense? \n\nMaybe have your partner should put a dryer vent hose to the window so it always goes outside.          They make those fittings just for windows.\n\nOther than that, either continue to be treated like a child or sit down and take a good long hard look at what the rest of your life will look like with a \"my way only\" person.\n\nGood lord.... **NTA**", "Sounds like a megalomaniac to me, and you should probably leave\u2026 like yesterday.", "NTA. Your partner is your equal. Not your parent, not your boss, not anyone with authority over you. If he can\u2019t accept that you need to leave him. That\u2019s fucked up.", "NTA. This is infuriating. Your partner is treating you like a child, not a partner. He is not your parent and can't just take away your video games when he feels like you made a mistake. This is very weirdly controlling and decidedly not normal. I'm infuriated on your behalf. Is this some sort of dom/sub thing he thinks you're doing? If so, you really want to have a talk with him about boundaries and expectations. If not, you still need to have that talk. And he needs to understand that you are a partner, not a child, and he can't just ground you for forgetting to open a window. As adults, we communicate. With words. Not with weird random punishments for minor mistakes.", "WTF!?! Your partner can ground you for making a mistake!?! YOUR PARTNER!?!!? What kind of relationship are you in? Unless this is some kind of BDSM fetish play, there's no respect for you in this relationship. Your partner is literally controlling and punishing you like a freaking kid. I would have dumped his ass on the curb the first time he even tried to pull this crap. He can get his own way by himself and ground his own damn self.\n\nNTA Glad you're finally standing up for yourself.", "What did I just read????\n\nAre you in some kind of sub-dom relationship?  How is it that one adult is even ALLOWED to \"punish\" the other?\n\nI'm sorry, but because of this and about 50 other details that you mention, this relationship stinks to high heaven.\n\nNTA", "Ummm. What kind of relationship is this that you truly believed he was punishing you by banning video games?!? AITA cannot help you here, you\u2019ve got much bigger issues.", "NTA. Your partner sounds toxic. You're 40 years old, why is he treating you like you're a child? \n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself. Tell him he can do his own damn laundry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a separate note, why is there no dryer ventilation? The only time I've really seen that in older apartments. If it's impossible/impractical to put in proper ventilation for the dryer, consider a ventless dryer or washer/dryer combo. They take longer than a traditional washer and dryer but will save you the headache of the mold/mildew problem.", "NTA", "Op your an adult not a child.\nBring up some boundaries in your relationship and talk! If he can't compromise, well maybe he isn't ready for a relationship.\n\nBut what I want to ask you, do you take something away from him, when he does a small mistake? How will he make it up to you, after he forgot to wash the dishes or dies this only apply to you?", "YTA for allowing yourself to be treated in this manner.  He sounds like a fucking Nazi", "Nta but maybe esh depening on my  next comments\n\nWhat comes to mind here is a non typical relationship dynamic, he sounds more like a daddy/dom and your submissive/little relationship.\n\nWhich is fine if that's something you have both discussed and agreed too with rules and consequences if things are not done on both sides.\n\nIf you've agreed to certain tasks and have in the past had \"reminders\" to do certain tasks which has worked the \"reminder\" being missed in this caae the note to open the window not being on the dryer, gives you a strong argument to say the punishment should not be for as long as he failed in his aspect of the relationship helping you to fulfil your end (I hope that makes sense) so if you are in this dynamic yes I think you can fully argue that the punishment is wrong.\n\nHowever if you are not in this sort of dynamic and its just always what he says go and your thoughts/inputs are not accepted or he has no consequences for something he does not do then seriously nta.\n\nAlso again not in that sort of dynamic he needs to grow up and you need to be firmer with him.", "Seriously! OP, your partner is treating you like a child, you should be asking yourself if they have any respect for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I have never heard of having to open a window to use the dryer, is this a thing???", "That's not even parenting that's abuse", "To clarify, I have never agreed to be in a dom/sub  relationship.", "This is abuse. Pure and simple. NO question about it.  Zero.", "He\u2019s abusing you.", "Please don't get me wrong I fully agree and don't thing you are in the wrong, as I said from the description of him wanting to ban you for a week from your games (FYI I love games and reading to escape from the real adult world to relax) puts me in mind of friends I have who have that sort of relationship. So if he came to me and said my wife (she's the dom in there dynamic) my answer would be was the reminder there if not then negotiate the punishment. \nYou have said your not in that dynamic so there should not be a punishment.\n I'm a forgetful person sticky notes and phone reminders are my best friend but if my partner said your not getting ... because you never done this my reply would be too laugh and say yeah nope not happening. Your solution is enough to put up the reminder no punishment is required. I'm sorry if I offended you with suggesting you are in that dynamic.", "What makes him think he can do it? Because he is allowed to.", "Fellow Aussie here. I\u2019ve never seen a vented dryer in my life, everyone I know has either a condensing or heat pump dryer, neither of which require you to open up a window when using. \n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t make a point of inspecting other peoples dryers so perhaps vented ones do exist here, in which case OP really should crack a window. Either way, it sounds like an honest mistake and his fianc\u00e9s insistence on punishing him for it is kinda weird. \n\nNTA", "I had a vented dryer that I had to place a hose out the window when using. But that was one I bought when in a rented property so wasn\u2019t in a position to fit it.\n \nIt\u2019s all moot in this case as it\u2019s a condenser dryer that doesn\u2019t need an outside vent as it emits water rather than steam. Having owned one of these two they do let off a little bit of steam so it\u2019s advisable to open a window(or in my case an extractor fan) it\u2019s not the end of the world to forgot once in a while.", "Lol I felt this so hard.", "Ooh\u2026sorry. I usually try to double check before I post. \n\nOf course that changes nothing. Abuse is abuse no matter the gender of the couple", "i wondered if it was a condenser unit.", "Oh yeah, this is absolutely abusive regardless of gender!", "OP is Australian, and as a fellow Aussie, I\u2019ve never seen a dryer with an exhaust vent on it. I was actually shopping for a new dryer fairly recently, and only ever came across condensing or heat pump models - neither of which vent hot and moist air that requires a window to be opened. \n\nSo not only does his fianc\u00e9 sound weirdly controlling, he\u2019s also misinformed."]}
