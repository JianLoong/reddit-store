Unless this is some dom/sub kink that the two of you share and have both consented to this should be unacceptable to you. You need to break up and leave. ASAP", "NTA, but your wanna be dad is. \nHonestly, all these comments that your partner is treating you like a kid aren't taking into account that this is shit treatment even if you WERE a kid - if you'd come on here saying AITA for punishing my teenager by taking games away for a week for not remembering to open a window, ywbta.\n\nThis guy is a controlling asshole.", "NTA, but you really need to evaluate why you are in this relationship.  Do you really enjoy being controlled and punished?  Sounds like you are a child and he is a parent.  Very strange dynamic, but if you find joy in it, I won't judge.  Sounds like you don't though.  I guess you have a decision to make shortly.", "op .....what else does he \"punish\"you for ... this guy is a control freak escape while you can for realz this is not a normal relationship", "NTA. He is supposed to be your partner not your parent", "You are NTA however he is a control freak. That in itself is scary because of the way you react to him", "NTA and yes your partner is awful, controlling and abusive, but WTF with the dryer and always opening a window? Doesnt your dryer have a vent hose to the outside????", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t get to discipline other grownups, unless it\u2019s consensual of course. If it takes making you feel bad to make him feel good about something, he is not the person for you. If anyone requires discipline, it\u2019s your partner for treating an equal like a subordinate. Ask him what is an appropriate punishment for him and who will be enforcing it.", "If my partner said that to me with a straight face, I'd be checking for head trauma, taking them to the shrink, scheduling MRI, etc. \n\nIf they were serious, sane and sound mind, yeah. No. I'm not a child, and that they **thought** they could order me around like one would not go well. It's not about what they wanted to implement. It's that they thought they had a right to do so in the first place.", "And OP argued back \"can't I make it up in some other way?\"\nAnd talking about \"reasonable compromise?\"\n\nOH HELLLLL NO. \n\nOP - Do not think in any way that you need to negotiate or find a compromise. Nothing more than \"hey you forgot to open the window, can you try to remember that?\" should have been said. \n\nGiven what he said, your response should have been, \"You are not my parent and I am not a child. You do not get to dole out punishments. I am sorry I forgot, but I get to decide how I am going to make sure to not repeat a mistake again, even a minuscule one. Let me know when you are ready to apologize for YOUR mistake in how you just addressed me.\"\n\nAlso, what an AH of a husband. From what I intuit, he sounds very controlling. This sounds like a symptom of a larger issue and you definitely need some individual counseling, but should also be thinking exit strategies.", "I know this gets thrown around to much on this forum, but my first thought for OP is RUN. This is not a healthy relationship, collect anything important to you and leave him in the dust.\n\nNTA", "Any if he's so concerned about damp from one occurrence then why doesn't he get a dehumidifier.", ">We own a house and have 2 dogs together. So it\u2019s not a simple thing just to break up. 95% of the time our relationship is great but this type of thing does happen from time to time.\n\nAh the old sunk cost fallacy reason for sticking it out. \n\nNo joke, you're in an abusive relationship and just taking it because it would be harder in the short term to end it. I'm normally super leery of this places tendency to tell people to end relationships, especially long standing ones, but your partner is treating you like a fucking child and you're just taking it because you're the \"peacemaker\". \n\nI've been in your situation before, I've also been where you're at before and I can tell you what's going to happen, when he see's that you're not going to roll over he's either going to go one of two ways:\n\n* Option 1: He's going to love bomb you and make you think he's turned over a new leaf, that he's seen the error of his ways, that you've got \"the spark\" back that you might have been missing. You'll fold and in a week, a month, or a year you'll be right back here.\n* Option 2: He's going to double down, get angry, and ramp up the abuse and gaslighting till you either capitulate due to your natural \"peacemaker\" tendencies or just to make the harassment and abuse stop. Once this happens he'll know that you're fully under his thumb and you'll probably start losing even more things that you love. \n\nThe only way to make it so this shit doesn't happen is if you wake up and get the fuck out, if not now, then soon, for your own well being.", "He\u2019s abusing you\u2014 I hope you get the help you need, and that you open your eyes and realize how toxic and abusive your relationship is. All the best.", "He controls your internet usage and access to certain apps. He treats you like a child. Your relationship is NOT 95% great. I sincerely hope that at the very least you start individual counseling so you can get some perspective because none of this is okay.", "You\u2019ve got a \u2018shit sandwich\u2019 situation. Picture the most delicious sandwich you\u2019ve ever had. Fresh bread, plenty of cheese, all your favourite toppings, it\u2019s still warm, great dipping sauce. The works. Best sandwich you\u2019ve ever had. But there\u2019s a catch, there\u2019s just a small turd somewhere in the sandwich. Human feces. Just a small piece of poop, still a great sandwich though. Doesn\u2019t matter how incredible that sandwich is, you\u2019re not eating it. Why would you eat a sandwich that had poop in it, no matter how small? Why would you stay in a relationship that is 5% shit? It\u2019s still shit. It\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s not healthy, it\u2019s not right.", "I\u2019m honestly howling at the thought of you going over and checking around his head for trauma", "I'd laugh at my husband if he said tht shit to me. Am i your child? Yall are both older than me and my husband OP but jesus working with kids all day i think I've seen 9yolds have better communication skills and with alot more maturity that this bs. \n\nYour relationship seems like it has alot of issues of this is how yall treat each other. Gods.", "Well precisely. It's probably more a control thing, hence the laughing and refusing to engage.", "WHAT??? You are an ADULT! He can just shut off your access to the internet? Do you not see how absolutely unacceptable and literally insane this is? This is your partner? This is someone you share the good and the bad with? He treats you like a kid, good god get out now!", "Wait. You have a condenser dryer and he's still \"punishing\" you for not opening a window?? The whole point of the condenser is so that you don't need to open a window! You can Google and see that one of the benefits of a condenser dryer is that they can be placed in rooms WITHOUT WINDOWS.\n\nI don't know if it's some sort of irrational tic or if your partner is intentionally doing this to create a situation where you feel like you're wrong, but there's absolutely no logical reason for you to need to open a window. NTA.", "Sone people lack the hole in the side of the house. They could always put a piece of plywood in the window with a hole but most don't know how to do that.", "Mate if you think the way he treats you is okay, you need therapy asap. This is not normal behaviour. Adults that respect each other don't act like this.", "OP, the way this man treats you is *not okay*! \"Most of the time he's great\" is a typical comment we see made here, but that other 5%? All red flags. He treats you like a child and thinks he can make those kinds of punishments, holds control of the internet over your head... what else does he do that you think isn't that bad? Monitors your phone? Your emails? Aren't allowed to have any friends of your preferred gender? I guarantee there are more behaviors of abuse he displays that might not seem like big deals."]}
