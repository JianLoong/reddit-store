I also forgot this 2-3 times there which highly annoyed my partner. So I put a label on the drier to remind me to ventilate which worked.

He initially said nothing, but did laugh a little bit in response. \n\nI lost my temper a bit and stormed off to calm myself down. I also apologised for this later on. \nWhen I came back I proposed that we put the label back on the drier instead, as this is more likely to prevent a reoccurrence.\n\nHe again said nothing and laughed about it. This made me quite angry and a further argument ensued.\n\nMy partner is a \u2018my way or no way\u2019 kind of person.

I feel liked I suggested a reasonable compromise which was immediately disregarded (as usual) and laughed at. \n\nI don\u2019t believe that in an adult relationship we should not have the right to punish each other by \u2018banning\u2019 things. So I\u2019ve never done it to him. \n\nII\u2019ve realised over the last few days that there is no compromise in our relationship and I\u2019m the one who always gives in no matter what. \n\nUsually by now I would have gone to him and accepted all blame.

And even if it is a mistake??? normal people just go like \"well that wasn't smart, let's see how we can fix this\".\n\n\\- controlling you by holding some power over your head- in this case he has access over the firewall or router settings. Ever heard about ' financial abuse' etc? this would fall in a similar category. Sure! you don't need video games to life, and he's not restricting food or money (I hope). But he's still punishing you and taking away your independence as an adult for something that shouldn't even be punished???\n\n\\- He's dictating all the things he expects you to do in the house. \" it is your responsibility to do xxx\". I mean sure but it sounds like you're being punished regularly, so this is not normal. I bet some of his rules aren't even that reasonable but you may not realize it.
