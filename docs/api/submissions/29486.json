{"id": 29486, "submission_id": "17egjy6", "title": "AITA for telling my father's affair partner that she married him and she can take care of him now that he can no longer take care of himself?", "selftext": "My father was not a very warm and caring father when my siblings and I (all in our 20s now) were young. I'm the youngest and I was only 8 when we all found out he was having an affair with a woman he worked with. The affair only came out because the affair partner grew tired of our father staying married to mom and showed no signs of being willing to divorce mom for her. So she took measures into her own hands and confronted mom with the truth. My siblings and I were all home at the time. It blindsided my mom significantly because, while she knew our father worked a lot, he had always been attentive as a spouse to her and he could play pretend that he was invested in his kids. My mom's marriage to him fell apart and she moved out of his house with us and we started anew. My father fought for shared custody. I often wonder if this was to punish her or us or something because it's not like he had any role in our lives at all. But he was awarded shared custody.\n\nHis affair partner threw herself into this role of \"stepmom\" and she acted like she was some new person who had no bad history with us/our family. She even ignored the fact she destroyed our mom's heart right in front of us. We did not like her and within two years she told our father she no longer wanted us around anymore because \"all we did was bully her and make her feel like she was some unimportant mistake he made\" and she was also bothered by the fact none of us would acknowledge her as our father's wife or our stepmom. When asked we would always say she was our father's affair partner. This wasn't something she wanted following her around or thrown in her face a lot.\n\nSo we had no contact with our father for more than a decade. I'm 22 now. Recently the affair partner made contact to inform us that our father had suffered several health complications and he is now ill and disabled. My oldest brother confirmed this is true and is aware of which hospital he's currently in. None of us had any interest in seeing him and we expressed this, though not to her, to our father's sister. His affair partner decided my siblings would never give in but she knew a much younger me had a hope for a better relationship with my dad and she tried to say she couldn't care for him and the four young children they have under the age of 7 and that \"my family needs me\". I told her clearly that they were not my family and that she married him so she was responsible for caring for him now that he cannot care for himself and I told her I would not help and did not care how tough it was for them.\n\nHer response was full of anger but she in not so many words called me an asshole. I ignored her but she again insulted me and claimed that I was sick and cruel for my stance.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698054390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17egjy6/aita_for_telling_my_fathers_affair_partner_that/", "score": 1284, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Our mom comes from a family who were always very comfortable and I have no doubt that she knows about that too.", "And babysitters! 4 kids under 7 wouldn't be easy to manage with a disabled partner in the house. However, its still karma.", "When the children they discard want nothing to do with them, why do parents always look like horrified pikachus?\n\nN.T.A.", "And after that made his bed too", "Nta", "I understand your feelings on the half-siblings but remember, they are NTA either. I'm sure their world is crumbling much the same way yours did at their age. One day, you may choose to have a relationship with them. I'd consider this when they are adults though and not under her control and she would undoubtedly try to manipulate you with them as leverage.", "I agree, I wouldn't seek out a relationship with them because of this, but I would not cut one off because of it if one existed. Like I said, OP owes these people nothing.", "Good to check off that possibility", "She absolutely wants something from you, whether it\u2019s money or someone to care for her husband and/or kids. She\u2019s looking at having to raise kids on a single income with finances in a bleak state since medical issues are so expensive. If it was just \u201cI want to give his other kids a chance to reconnect\u201d she wouldn\u2019t be raving at you, she\u2019d just let it go. But she wants something from you that you have no obligation to give, given how they both treated you. You are free to block any contact from her if that helps.", "Keep away from her. Do not let her convince you into supporting her kids \"because they are your younger siblings and family helps family\".", "She wouldn't be able to access your mom's families money. If she thinks she can, she is delusional.", "Oh, I don't blame them at all for any of this. But I just do not consider them my family. Related by blood, sure. But nothing more than that. I don't see a time where that will change for me or for my older siblings.", "She could never convince me to do that. I do not consider those kids to be part of my family and have zero interest in changing that.", "She wouldn't but the assumption is probably we could access it and help her/them with it, which is a big fat no from me.", "Why would she think you all would do that after the way you were treated? Some people are pure idiots."]}
