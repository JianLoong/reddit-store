I'm the youngest and I was only 8 when we all found out he was having an affair with a woman he worked with. The affair only came out because the affair partner grew tired of our father staying married to mom and showed no signs of being willing to divorce mom for her. So she took measures into her own hands and confronted mom with the truth. My siblings and I were all home at the time. It blindsided my mom significantly because, while she knew our father worked a lot, he had always been attentive as a spouse to her and he could play pretend that he was invested in his kids. My mom's marriage to him fell apart and she moved out of his house with us and we started anew. My father fought for shared custody. I often wonder if this was to punish her or us or something because it's not like he had any role in our lives at all. But he was awarded shared custody.\n\nHis affair partner threw herself into this role of \"stepmom\" and she acted like she was some new person who had no bad history with us/our family. She even ignored the fact she destroyed our mom's heart right in front of us. We did not like her and within two years she told our father she no longer wanted us around anymore because \"all we did was bully her and make her feel like she was some unimportant mistake he made\" and she was also bothered by the fact none of us would acknowledge her as our father's wife or our stepmom. When asked we would always say she was our father's affair partner. This wasn't something she wanted following her around or thrown in her face a lot.\n\nSo we had no contact with our father for more than a decade. I'm 22 now. Recently the affair partner made contact to inform us that our father had suffered several health complications and he is now ill and disabled. My oldest brother confirmed this is true and is aware of which hospital he's currently in. None of us had any interest in seeing him and we expressed this, though not to her, to our father's sister. His affair partner decided my siblings would never give in but she knew a much younger me had a hope for a better relationship with my dad and she tried to say she couldn't care for him and the four young children they have under the age of 7 and that \"my family needs me\". I told her clearly that they were not my family and that she married him so she was responsible for caring for him now that he cannot care for himself and I told her I would not help and did not care how tough it was for them.\n\nHer response was full of anger but she in not so many words called me an asshole. I ignored her but she again insulted me and claimed that I was sick and cruel for my stance.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698054390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17egjy6/aita_for_telling_my_fathers_affair_partner_that/", "score": 5870, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Within a year her dad gave up all visitation because stepmomster didn't want them around. Stepmonster was starting her own little family and my friend and her siblings were thrown to the side. 3 kids and about 15 years later, stepmonster contacted my friend and her siblings to let them know that her dad had a stroke and he was no longer able to take care of himself. Step-monster declared and demanded that my friend and her siblings take care of him and their kids because she wanted to go on with her life and not be burdened with them anymore. My friend and her siblings told stepmother to f off. Stepmonster was relentless and kept contacting them. My friend and her siblings had had enough of the harassment and went to the courts and got a protection order against stepmonster. The courts told stepmonster if she violated the protection order she would be arrested and put in jail. Stepmonster contacted my friend's brother and he recorded the conversation, hung up with her and contacted the police. Stepmonster was arrested and spent 2 days in jail. Stepmonster never contacted them again. About 5 or 6 years later her dad passed away, but stepmonster was the one who had to take care of him and the kids by herself until he died. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.\n\nMy friend, her siblings and I still get together and on a few of our times together they had all told me if they would have been a part of their lives, they would have helped take care of their dad and siblings, but because stepmonster treated them like garbage and threw them out, they owed her nothing and that is exactly what they gave her. You and your siblings do not owe them anything and therefore tell them to kick rocks or to f off. \n\nWe all have compassion for the kids who they still have never met, but there is none for stepmonster.

The only two people at the graveside service were my brothers and a guy from the army with a tape recorder playing taps.", "sooooo much carnage, much blood, very revenge", "I didn't say that.

(TLDR: my violently abusive father became homeless in his final years, and I had to intervene to keep him from ending up living on the streets.)\n\nAn abuse victim caring for their abuser is emphatically *not the same thing* as the abuse victim acting to prevent his or her parent from ending up homeless.  In my case, it never once entered my mind to allow my father to live with me and my wife.  What I am saying is that a child should not abandon an aging and infirm parent to be mistreated.  \n\nSo, I will again ask the question:\n\nWho would be the bigger AH: the father for destroying his family, or OP for abandoning him to die?", "OP's father is unquestionably guilty of destroying his own family and his relationships with his children.  Are you saying this frees OP of any moral obligation to see that OP's father doesn't end up homeless and very likely dead?  (And lest you think that I'm trying to cover for abusive and neglectful parents, let me be clear that [I have personal experience with this exact issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/156zfvd/my_father_died_six_years_ago_i_have_yet_to_shed_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).)", "I didn't say that.  I don't believe that, and I never have.

(TLDR: my violently abusive father ended up homeless in his final years, leaving me to see that he didn't end up living under a highway overpass.)\n\nLet me be crystal clear as to what I'm saying.  It has been a generally held belief that children are to be present to make sure that their parents - without whom those children would not exist - should see to it that their parents are cared for in their later years.  By \"cared for,\" I am saying that those parents should:\n\n* have a safe place to live\n* are fed and clothed\n* have access to adequate healthcare\n* be treated humanely\n\n***That's it.  Nothing more.***  A child who has been abused by a parent is under no obligation whatsoever to expose himself or herself to one bit of further abuse or mistreatment at the hands of his or her parent.  They are under no obligation of any kind to engage in a relationship with that parent.  They certainly don't have to allow them into their home.  \n\nIn short: OP wouldn't have to \"get back into an abusive relationship\" - or any kind of relationship - with their father.  I'm simply saying that OP shouldn't sit back and allow their father to die if that were a possibility.  Why do you believe that OP would be morally permitted to do so?", "Really?   Is that a thing?   I\u2019m not American, but I have never heard of children being responsible for their parents financially.   That makes no sense to me at all.", "Their reaction to all of this has been much stronger than mine.", "Sounds like she\u2019s clutching at straws.

OP has a chance to heal some of her wounds. \n\nHer step mother reached out and asked for help with her her father. OP can tell her go to hell. OP could also provide some level of help to her father that does not impede on OP's mental health and well being. I'm not suggesting OP take dad in and care for him around the clock.... maybe doing something small periodically like taking him to an appointment or bringing a meal or whatever might be helpful but not impeding on OP's life.

They are strangers. Family isn\u2019t blood.", "Nope, they just happen to share a sperm donor \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f They are not related, they are not family. They are less than nothing to eachother.", "Right!  I\u2019m so tired of people saying.  Well, it\u2019s your family!  You only have one family!  They\u2019re old school and don\u2019t know any better, can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks! Ughhhh!! For the life of me I don\u2019t know why we have allowed this for so long for so many families. It is not OK for family to treat you like shit and expect everything in return whether immediately end or later on down the road in life. It\u2019s never OK.  In life we have to be OK walking away from people that do not treat us with proper respect and care no matter who they are rich, poor, family, boyfriends, teachers who ever.  I honestly believe there would not be as much mental health problems in the world if we had a better grasp at sticking up for ourselves against family.", "> How do we expect society to change if we reward poor behavior as if it never happened?\n\nTaking care of someone after they abandon you is rewarding bad behaviour, what are you on about.", "you're chump dude, we got it.", "I'm not convinced that's accurate.  Op's father divorced OP's mother. He didn't abandon his children. He sought and obtained joint custody in the divorce. He tried to raise his kids until they made life in his household so miserable for his wife and him that he gave up, which was what the children wanted. Even if you are a child, you don't get to mistreat someone you don't want to be around so much they finally say \"yeah, okay\" and then claim they abandoned you.", "I'm very aware that OP's father did the abandoning in their relationship.  He did an outstanding job of nuking his own family, and destroying any hope of a relationship with his children from his first marriage.  \n\nThat said, a child having a relationship with a parent and a child's obligation to that parent's wellbeing are not at all the same thing.  So let's say that OP's father was destitute, ill and homeless, and left to his own devices, is likely to end up dead on the streets.  Here are my questions:\n\n1. Who would be the bigger AH: the father for destroying his family, or OP for abandoning the father to die?  \n2. Why would it be permissible for OP to stand back and allow his or her father to die?  Put another way: why is the father's behavior - which is unquestionably appalling in any context - a capital offense?\n3. How is it that OP making sure that her father doesn't end up homeless is equated with OP having a relationship with him?  Why does one automatically result in the other?", "Why?", "Oh that's easy! That \"the woman's responsibility\"!", "Can't they make the case that they were abandoned?", "Not at all, you're not secure. You're rigid and you talk like you can't let anything go because you think that's how you respect yourself.

Op is as morally correct to stay away and do nothing as they are to step in for the sake of these children. They are strangers who happen to share blood and they are under no obligation in any way to help.", "They are the literal definition of siblings. Family can be more than just blood relations, of course, but... these are babies who are literally OP's siblings. \"I don't care if these little children who have done nothing wrong except have the audacity to exist in a manner that's inconvenient for me, are technically my siblings\" is solid TA territory. \n\nThe absolute lack of love and compassion toward babies shown by so many people in this thread is just appalling.", "> You only have one family\n\nApparently not OP's Dad lol", "Exactly. it bothers me that so many people say oh family blah blah blah as if you should just put up with the bullshit.

So many things that get brought up I can honestly trace back to how my mother treated me.", "OP literally said the new wife made the father cut off contact with the kids, so I stopped reading after your third sentence. That is abandoning your kids, whether you\u2019re convinced or not. Love you", "A child has no obligation to their parent\u2019s well being in a case of abandonment by said parent, regardless of said parent\u2019s potential illness or death.

OP doesn't sound emotionally immature at all, and you are insulting them with that label because they aren't ok with their dad leaving the family for a side piece who thinks their victims should help them after they tore apart their family and left them. \n\nThe side piece wouldn't be reaching out if her older married guy was still going strong, and she's basically looking for anyone to take the work off of her plate. She had big people problems and needs to handle them like a big girl, and not ask a 22 year old she threw away to help. \n\nTelling OP they are handling it with anything less then the extreme grace they are handling it with (an emotionally immature person would have laughed at them, gossiped about them, went on social media to attack them, etc) is just you manipulating OP for not helping out the trash.", "OP seems to feel neither, hence the \"cold\" thing.", "> They are strangers who happen to share blood and they are under no obligation in any way to help.\n\nThe fact that you feel no moral obligation to help strangers blows my mind.

Again. We don\u2019t have to care about people deeply because who are not in our lives and have 0 connection to us. \n\nOp is not an asshole for not wanting to know these strange kids. \n\nI hope you keep that same energy and adopt literally every single baby that doesn\u2019t have a family then since you care about every single baby.
